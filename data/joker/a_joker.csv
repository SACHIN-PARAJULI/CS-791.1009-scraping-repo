"Apr 13, 2024",POSITIVE,Who knew a movie made me sympathetic towards the Joker?
"Apr 13, 2024",POSITIVE,'Joker' is a masterpiece of comic-book cinema.
"Apr 13, 2024",POSITIVE,SUCH A MASTER PIECE ITS SHOWS US DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF DAILY LIFE AND WHAT ITS LIKE TO BE THE OTHER PERSON
"Apr 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie, Phoenix nailed as the joker"
"Apr 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"A masterpiece showing what would happen if a mentally ill would make his worst ideas real, most stunningly depicted by Joaquin Phoenix. He definitely earned his Oscar.
To me it's the best film so far taking place in the universe of an American superhero franchise. An absolute must-watch."
"Apr 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Excellent acting and cinematography, but of the 1000's of movies I've seen, there are only 2 that I would call disturbingly irresponsible pieces of art.  This is one.  Don't waste your time, it's 2 hours you'll never get back."
"Apr 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"Well mental illness and struggles are hard to define from person to person ...I am over 60 ..in pain with arthritis and loosing hearing plus anxiety & depression as conjoined twins .. which I never thought I would get to at this stage ...but finding anyone putting these awful issues of trauma ...hurt ..despise ...vengeful thoughts ?? I came out of the cinema pretty shaken and first words were ...' what the hell did I just see' ...I was put on the spot of my own issues of hate or seething..misunderstanding and just wearing life with a smile.
I have watched many a DC and Marvel commentary on the big screen ..some with 'pow' ...'zap' and gotcha ...to some nonsense 3 hour slog of bum.numness..which has beat me...what Todd gave us was not refreshing but a mirror to society of our current understanding that mental illness and struggle are too hard to deal with or comprehend (plus violence)  ..how to work it out ..so we going to visit part 2 and I stayed alive thus far to make it to part 2 ...however ...one day ...it will count for so much more than comic books or  madness ...mayhem please see further than the end of popcorn stuffed noses and cheese stuffed nachos ...and endless pepsi refills."
"Apr 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,One of the most unwatchable movies I have ever had the displeasure of viewing.
"Apr 10, 2024",NEUTRAL,"An okay movie. Worth a watch. 
My two biggest problems are:
1. Why did this need to be a batman movie? If you took the exact same plot, set it in Chicago, took out Thomas Wayne and replaced him with some other billionaire, and instead of calling himself joker at the end, he called himself something else, would it actually change the story? I don't think so.
2. The story's themes had been done better in other movies decades ago. For the modern generation of superhero fans who've never seen films like Taxi driver, King of comedy or Falling down, the film might seem groundbreaking, but those films did the same thing and they did them much better. 
It's basically a Taxi driver, King of comedy mashup with a hint of Falling down with a Batman coat of paint slapped on it."
"Apr 4, 2024",POSITIVE,joker joker joker joker
"Apr 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,Acknowledging that you're ripping something off (King of Comedy) doesn't make it okay.
"Apr 3, 2024",NEUTRAL,It was a good story of a person turning psycho.
"Mar 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"Was going into this film with low expectations, and boy did it surpass them! A very gritty and dark realism take on the Joker Character. Makes you see the world from his eyes and at points makes you feel a sense of dread just as the story's protagonist does. Nearly a flawless film in my opinion. Only main gripe is that this feels like a psychological horror film with Batman elements thrown in. But this is definitely a must watch for any movie goer."
"Mar 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"Son unas de las mejores representaciones del origen del conocido personaje Joker, su oscuro pasado le da un toque al personaje dando más explicación sobre su personalidad demente."
"Mar 27, 2024",POSITIVE,Such an incredible movie! Excited for the sequel!
"Mar 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie feels like it doesn't belong in any sort of DC movie, and that's why it did well."
"Mar 20, 2024",POSITIVE,really like the vibes
"Mar 14, 2024",POSITIVE,10/10 I be dun needz the sequese ripe meow!!!!
"Mar 13, 2024",POSITIVE,this  is my second favorite movie
"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"Una maravillosa pelicula, sin entrar en spoilers es una genial critica a la tirania y al poco cuidado de la clase obrera por parte de la gente con mayor poder politico. Una pelicula de culto."
"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Meh.  Underwhelming, mostly very boring Joker origin story."
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Pretty descent movie,I like how they showed his progression from being abused and how mental illness affects people."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Interesting take on mental illness and the control capitalism has on us but especially the vulnerable. Beautiful and sad and sort of scary at times while still feeling sympathetic.
"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"In my Opinion it doesn't deserve a 69% and Joaquin Phoenix is the best Joker I've ever seen. Go watch the Movie, is pretty good."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"Muito bom esse filme! Recomendo assistir.
Apesar de não parecer estar vinculado a um filme de Super herói, o filme entrega muita qualidade. O Ator mandou muito bem no personagem principal."
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"I didn't expect to enjoy the movie, but was surprised to discover it was much deeper than expected, and very satisfying."
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"I usually steer clear of films that consist of such disturbing themes but Joker was a brilliant exposition of the dispossessed and alienated in our society. I doubt anyone except Joaquin Phoenix could have carried the story the way he did, thoroughly deserving his Oscar."
"Feb 23, 2024",NEUTRAL,"So, if you asked me to describe Joker, I'd tell you it's an art film first and foremost. This is deconstructing the Joker mythos and applying it to a grittier Gotham backdrop for the sake of relatability and sympathy. I'm all for a sympathetic villain, but this was almost excessive. If it weren't an art film. Art films get a pass on heavy-handed social commentary, to me, because the ideas are meant to be impressionable. Very slow moving, kind of boring, but overall a decent film. Wouldn't watch again."
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"How excelent of an actor do you have to be, for the viewer to forget the world around him and feel the pain the main character goes trough"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Was extremely boring.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Joker is a fantastic film, and a compelling origin for Joker. The whole film was enjoyable, though I would say that the second half is far better than the first half, and it's not particularly close. If the whole movie was as good as the second half, it would probably be a five-star. That's not to say the first half wasn't compelling or good, but it just couldn't really match the second half. Joaquin Phoenix's acting is nothing short of amazing, with his near-perfect portrayal of Arthur's descent into madness, which is a great time to watch. The overarching plot is also very well written, witch kept my eyes glued to the screen for nearly the entire runtime. This film was also really lacking in side characters, with almost all of them being very forgettable and uninteresting, which really left only one good character (albeit one very good character) carrying its entire 122 minute runtime. Besides these flaws though, Joker is a fantastic origin story for one of the greatest villains in media, and a great film. I can't wait to see what's coming next in the sequel."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It's pretty stupid, really.  It's like going to hear a rock band and the guitar player solos almost the entire time. There's nothing real in it.  A total wank that's been done before and alot better."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Very god the realism the final
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,The build up origins of batman and joker at same time at the end was nuts the cast 10/10 soundtrack 10/10 the story was crazy humor 10/10
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,By far and away the greatest film that I do not ever want to watch again.
"Feb 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"Yet another captivating performance per Joaquin Phoenix. Joker heavily touches on the outside influences society has on those with mental illness, as well as how society treats those with mental illness. Oh, and just what mental illness can look like from the perspective of the maniacal. For those thinking Joker has depression.... touch up on your crazy, they don't all come with blues. Some appear in shades of vibrant red and yellow."
"Feb 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,Feels less like a comic based movie and more like an unhelpful telling of mental illness.
"Feb 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A real POC, don't waste your time.  The high audience rating must  have come from a prison audience."
"Feb 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"So dissapointed. I wish I had never seen or heard of this movie so I can go back to thinking to joker was an amazing villain. This movie unequivocally ruined the character, his original reasonings, and his original motivations. Wondering why joker could possibly be the way he is, is unfathomably better than this being why he is how he is. There is nothing wrong with mental illness, but insanity was the every foundation of the joker to me and that's gone now. I do not wish to spoil to the movie for you if you insist on seeing it, but I'll make a comparison to help convey what you will experience. Imagine Batman was actually Batman because he used to be a baseball player and wanted to make a pun, and he has a medical condition that causes his voice to go deeper. Also he actually refuses to kill anyone because he stopped seeing his imaginary friend when he was little, and doesn't want to see anyone else he meets disappear. That's the impeccable storytelling you're in for folks"
"Feb 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This is the most unpleasant movie experience I've had since the first IT movie a couple years ago. My hopes were high considering the awards attention it got - culminating in a Best Actor Oscar for Phoenix. But this is an empty, superficial movie that doesn't offer any context about violence beyond what the average viewer would bring to it. I can't begin to understand the adulation this received. I won't fault Phoenix's work here - he is as committed as ever. But this is yet another case of a brilliant actor being rewarded for the wrong film. This is an ugly movie, both aesthetically and beneath the surface. Comparisons to TAXI DRIVER were made upon its release; and while I think TAXI DRIVER is a bit overrated, it is miles ahead of this movie, and I didn't find any similarities beyond a disgruntled protagonist. If you want to see a movie about the destruction of a man due to the world around him, please check out Jake Gyllenhaal in NIGHTCRAWLER instead. De Niro appears very uncomfortable in a supporting role that obviously will be compared to Jerry Lewis in THE KING OF COMEDY. This is bleak, unremitting and ultimately predictable. A crushing disappointment!"
"Jan 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"Phoenix has his well deserved Oscar winning performance. 
Scary enough to make you feel sorry for his evilness, yet not so evil as simply proving a point of how humanities ignorance brings out the worst in us all."
"Jan 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"This has become one of my favorite movies of all time! The acting, the story, the music and directing, it's all well thought out and presented perfectly. It's also a moral story, warning of what would happen should the rich keep getting richer, while the rest of us wallow in despair. And it also warns of what happens when those who need help most are left alone, backs turned in a callous mega city, becoming monsters made by man. And just like Godzilla was sent to punish man, Joker is sent to make everyone pay, a monster unable to be anything else, and a chilling source of pure evil."
"Jan 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Garbage...it's best feature is it helped me to further appreciate Tim Burton's Batman, which is far superior. Phoenix and DeNiro's talents are totally wasted here, with a story that is not just poor but downright offensive, whether intended or not."
"Jan 24, 2024",POSITIVE,Wonderful portrayl of a broken man whose the society makes him this way
"Jan 21, 2024",POSITIVE,Es la mejor actuación de Joaquin Phoenix de su carrera y una excelente interpretación del Joker la película te mantiene siempre esperando la siguiente escena por lo que merece una secuela Joker 2
"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Absolutely gorgeous and fantastic
"Jan 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I really like Joaquin Phoenix, but this movie doesn't add anything to his repertoire. It's too goofy for a serious drama, and too depressing for a superhero (supervillain?) movie. The entire premise begs the question, so the entertainment value is doomed to the perversity of voyeurism.

It's a good thing this is a standalone story because if this were where the Joker persona is headed, I would stop watching Batman productions altogether."
"Jan 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,i actually liked it. not that bad! i fuckim love watching embarrassing shiz
"Jan 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A completely value inverted world, where the low-life loser is depicted as a hero. That's what makes it completely unrealistic, bordering on fantasy... A fantasy of nihilism."
"Jan 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie.  It is one of the few comic based movies that is truly great.
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"In my opinion better than suicide squad joker. This one gets to the development the reality of how someone like joker can come to be. It's more closely related to reality, on top of it this joker reminds me of my childhood joker from the cartoon batman. The laugh is on point, his hysteria, I love that the fact how they woven his joker personality not because of a chemical accident but because of a psychopathology. Suicide squad joker, was the average bad guy joker. Joaquin Phoenix is the 2nd best up to Heath Ledger's joker."
"Jan 13, 2024",POSITIVE,It was a good movie but also one of the saddest and depressing movies.
"Jan 13, 2024",POSITIVE,A dizzying contradiction of a film. The ideas that 'Joker' forces you to evaluate make this much more unique and worthwhile than your average comic fare.
"Jan 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,The movie has no action. I thought the joker was a maniacle violent clown going on a killing spree and blowing things up. Heath Ledger was better. Phoenix is boring the worst joker. The movie is taking too long to show the violent side of joker.
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"I really love this film, this film is one of my favorites, everything about this film is very perfect, the soundtrack, the characters, etc..."
"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved it! It depicts just how wrong the mental health facilities are and what happens when those who need it don't get help. It's ""beautifully sad"". Would and have recommended this movie! If you haven't seen it, do it. Just don't expect too much ""Batman"" there are easter eggs here and there but it's mainly a movie about why Joker/Arthur is the way he is."
"Jan 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This is a movie made by people who definitely have seen ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The King of Comedy"" several times but didn't really understand either movie. This results in a tiresome spectacle of it appearing to say something profound but can't manage any meaningful observations besides ""Wow, society sure sucks."" I'm not opposed to darker comic book adaptations for adults but I really don't want this uninspired nihilism to become the norm."
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"A powerful movie, very interesting would definitely watch again"
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"85/100 - Fantastic film. Joaqiun pheonix did an exceptional job playing this troubled character. My only complaint is that if you watch this film and the batman films related to it, the story is incoherent as each one tries to make you sympathize with the main character. The wayne family is portrayed as cruel upper class elitist, whereas in the batman films they were portrayed as loving parents taken too soon. I just wish that the continuity of the stories blended better, but as an independent story its very good."
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"I was quite surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. It was a lot more serious and complex than I thought it would be, but I think they succeeded in everything they were trying to do. Great movie, really enjoyed how mature it was."
"Jan 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"You couldn't offer me $1,000,000 to sit through this garbage again. Movies are meant to be entertaining, not disturbing; I fear young people may want to view this with high expectations, only to be subjected to violence."
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,I love the joker so much dressed up as it for Halloween killed it and Joaguin just killed this part. He sacrificed a lot to get this part too it payed off can't wait for the second one with Lady Gaga!!!.
"Jan 6, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I thought this movie was well written, and well acted, I just thought that it was very disturbing and it was very uncomfortable to watch, especially someone who used to have mental health problems

And this movie touches on mental health, illness, from a villain standpoint of a superhero movie, so at the end of the day he's supposed to be a clown. He's supposed to be silly and funny and goofy and a villain, but he was a serial killer and a lunatic, which we know from the comics

But we are not putting in that position as children to see that on a big screen, we see him as Jack Nicholson, or as someone that delivers more of that I'm a Batman, villain. Batman has the best villains of all time, but this movie made him a complete sociopath.

And it literally made it extremely uncomfortable after the film watching it. I definitely wouldn't let my kids watch it."
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,Top Film mit brillanter Performance von Joaquin Phoenix.
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"You have never seen the joker like this, very original, i liked overall"
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,It was excellent. I was not sure what to expect but it was good.
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Brilliant dive into the dark and brutal dystopian society that differs very little from our own. Phoenix is amazing!
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Phoenix is mesmerising
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,Slow and stupid. Trying to hard to be some sort of lame statement and not hard enough to be thrilling and entertaining. I really don't care about his feelings. Those of us who achieve more see those who don't as clowns.
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,By far the best Batman movie
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is just a cinematic masterpiece.  If I could give 10 stars I would
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Joaquin did an excellent job making me feel uncomfortable while watching his decent into madness as the Joker. 
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,An amazing story about the struggles of mental illness. A creative and deep backstory to an iconic character
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,A movie that managed to make a well-known antagonist impactful among audiences.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,laughing man became the furry green goblin
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS MOVIE GOT 69% OF ROTTEN TOMATOES IT JUST WRONG BROTHER
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,No words need. This is masterpiece
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,pretty good! and wow— the critic reviews are so pretentious..
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"My favorite movie is him
Joker is a GOOD MOVIE, Joaquin Phoenix is amazing and powerful in his role, same for Robert De Niro, Todd Phillips managed to make the most evil psychopathic character in the world."
"Dec 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Well established plot with interesting characters and outcomes.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,this is cinema.......
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"When Joaquin is gone, he will be remembered for this portrayal. Great film, great acting and direction."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"An absolute masterpiece, both produced and filmed with an authentic perspective. Media representation at its peak projection."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,So good in the most yikes kinda way.
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"As usual, not a single ""professional reviewer"" understood this movie."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing acting from Joaquin Phoenix, who plays a sympathetic character. Kudos for making bold choices in the filmmaking and acting."
"Dec 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,Didn't hate but it didn't hit me in the same way it did everyone else. It's a comic book character. I just didn't take it as seriously.
"Nov 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"An origin story for the clown-prince of crime has never been so dreary and realistic! Joaquin portrays the tragedy and comedy of Arthur Fleck, a struggling comedian who soon adapts a more twisted sense of humor. With violence and guts galore, this film is not for one who doesn't have a sense of humor!"
"Nov 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix's Joker can be considered just as good as Heath Ledger's Joker.
"Nov 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"as kids, we love the heroes. as adults, we understand the villains."
"Nov 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Between BRIGHTBURN and BATMAN BEGINS - a reinvention of character-building

While DC branched out with an evil version of Superman in Brightburn, it also built the sympathetically good side of Joker with Joaquin Phoenix. Played as a study of psychology in motion, this was one of the best superhero-based movies to be released on the big screen, even though it was all about the supervillain. Phoenix's performance is gut-grippingly good, and the supporting actors deliver perfectly on-point performances. The flexible and ambidextrous abilities of DC are amazing; feeding off human nature and building characters whose stories are a presence beyond the capabilities of most screenwriting. Joker's struggles are brought to light even while we (the community of comic readers) know that his infliction is venomous and unhealable. Truly a multilayered story, Joker is one of the best movies to come out in the 21st century, thus far."
"Nov 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Joquin Phoenix performance is stellar and the soundtrack is really good.
Robert DeNiro has a fantastic performance in this movie and the ambientation is perfect.
This shows how to make comic inaccurate things but doing that well,not like M-she u movies."
"Nov 13, 2023",POSITIVE,A must watch for anyone
"Nov 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing actor JP really made it his own character and the director did a great job and the writing was great the costumes were good the background actors were good .
"Nov 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Joker is just one of those movies, that resinate with me in a way no other movie ever has. The music itself plays so much emotion, Joaquin Phoenix's performance is outstanding, and the movie is just so beautiful in itself."
"Nov 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is amazing. I had hoped that more directors would take their cues from this but it seems that the comics moviemakers have decided to go in the other, predictable direction. The Joker is a tour de force that captures the spirit of the character and makes you truly feel for his situation and what made him the monster. Phoenix is a masterful actor in this. Jared Leto should be ashamed of himself after what he had done to the character in Suicide Squad. I wrote off this movie until my Mom just about forced me to watch it. Then I did and at the end I was breathless. Thank you, Mr. Phoenix, for proving that the tired ""superhero genre"" still has life in it.

So why didn't more directors follow suit? I cannot understand. But perhaps that's what makes The Joker all the more special…"
"Nov 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This dives into what it takes to break a person. Childhood trauma....mental health....and the cancer that's the general public.  

Think it also speaks to the jokers inept ability to keep us guessing.  Is this the real version he doesn't tell? Or just another manipulation from a psychotic mind justifying his actions."
"Nov 5, 2023",POSITIVE,very dark movie well acted reminded me of the film taxi driver. cool supervillian origin story kinda like the film Split but way darker joquin phonixs performance is worth watching dark and gritty film id say its worth a watch if u can handle hard r rated films definetly not for kids.
"Nov 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"From Todd Phillips comes a new take on Joker starring Joaquin Phoenix as the iconic Batman villain in a prequel character study where Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) goes from being a broken, down-and-out party clown to the king of chaos in Gotham City.

Arthur is a lonely clown-for-hire with a sick mother he still lives with and a condition prompting him to laugh uncontrollably in the most awkward moments. He dreams of being a stand-up comedian but, between his condition, his increasingly dire work situation and bombshell revelations at home, it becomes harder and harder for him to see the funny side. Especially when the people around Arthur seem hellbent on making his life even more of a living hell. The only bright spark in all this is Arthur's neighbor Sophie (Zazie Beetz) who lives down the hall and is the only one showing him any form of affection. After losing his job, an altercation on the subway ends in bloodshed and things take a turn for the worse. Seeing his hero, talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), embarrass him on national television certainly doesn't help things either.

Much has been said about Joker since its release, with some dismissing it as a derivative, simplistic society-made-me-do-it tale while others called it a masterpiece. Admittedly, Joker owes a lot to early Martin Scorsese works like Taxi Driver and King Of Comedy but it's also clear that the casting of Robert De Niro in a major role is no accident: this is a nod to those other grim anti-hero character studies, with a comic book twist. To be fair, the Tim Burton Batman films were pure German Expressionism, X-Men spin-off Logan evoked classic westerns, every comic book movie is derivative in some way, Joker is simply more obvious about what inspired it.

And this point leads me to what I think is the most apt criticism one can make about this film. It does everything it sets out to do extremely well but often in a slightly too obvious or heavy-handed way. From the moody cello-led score (which is admittedly very good) to Arthur's clearly unjust treatment at work and at home, and the recurrent laughter/crying contrast, this is exactly what you'd expect an ant melting under a magnifying glass to look like and there's not much there to be surprised about, except perhaps one twist near the end of the film. 

What Joker lacks in originality, however, it makes up for in sheer competence. Joaquin Phoenix gives another phenomenal performance: his take on the Joker is very different than any we've seen before even if, costume-wise, there's a clear Heath Ledger vibe. His Arthur Fleck is so fragile it makes numerous scenes quite uncomfortable to watch. That skinny, frail frame and arched back, every wrinkle on Phoenix's face is like a scar telling a story, his muted voice with its tone that's always slightly off, the impromptu dances. Arthur, we come to find, was the performance all along and Joker was the painful truth underneath it all.

This isn't the story of a man pushed to his limits by society, though he does use that as a convenient excuse for his wrongdoings and society certainly didn't help. This is a story about how mental illness and physical abuse, if left untreated or misdiagnosed, coupled with financial strain and a rough upbringing, can force people into unsustainable performances of themselves that will inevitably clash with the world around them and how they really feel. Arthur is not just some angry guy who flips out one day because people are mean to him, he's a man with deeply embedded psychological issues that were never addressed, let alone resolved. What little medical help he is provided with is just not good enough and, when even that is taken away from him, what happens next is tragic yet it feels inevitable.

The themes explored in Joker are important and relevant with director Todd Phillips approaching the iconic villain, his emotions and even the Batman comics as a whole, with a lot of respect and attention to detail. While we empathize with Arthur and his tragic life story, his Joker persona is never truly glorified (except by himself) and his crimes are never excused, even with the social unrest brewing in Gotham City providing just the right environment for them. 

A key scene in which he confronts his idol-turned-rival Murray Franklin shows him try to rationalize his behavior and, when that doesn't fly with the audience or Murray himself, he resorts to a senseless act of violence. This proves he is unable to excuse what he's done yet it also facilitates his ascension into a symbol of anarchy and chaos. Ultimately, it's the positive attention given to him by a niche group of rioters willing to adopt this destructive mentality that wins over in the end.

Joker won't be to everyone's taste but it remains a carefully crafted, masterfully acted film with a lot more depth than most comic-book movies and there's something refreshing about seeing an origin story that's about the character but also about bigger, more relatable things. It'll be interesting to see where follow-up projects in the same vein will go from there.

Fantastic, no joke."
"Nov 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Joker is a MASTERPIECE, No Doubt about that. 🤩"
"Oct 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"A benchmark in the DC universe, and movie's in general with one of the greatest actors of all time giving a once-in-a-lifetime performance."
"Oct 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies of last years, its a absolute jewel, even if not a fan of dc comics, or comics at all."
"Oct 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Truly amazing movie! Joaquin is such a great actor.
"Oct 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"The scenario told in this film depicts a situation in which we frequently disregard the feelings and situations of others around us, people who may not have the same advantages as us. We can sense the psychological upheaval that Joker is experiencing from his point of view. All disappointment and rage build up and eventually explode. The people of Gotham rebelled as a result of their dissatisfaction and indignation at the injustice they faced. 

The Joker is also seen dancing on a car in the midst of the rioting, surrounded by people shouting his name. Making them an embodiment of ""Hero"" in order for them to share their ideas.

"Oct 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Uncomfortable, disturbing and just weird how it wants you to be ok with mental illness?! It was weird. Hated it."
"Oct 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Perfeição, melhor filme que retrata realmente uma pessoa fudida da cabeça, táxi drive tenta imitar, mas Joker é realmente a realidade"
"Oct 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Mikey's Movie Review: Joker (2019)
Todd Phillips' channels the spirit of prime era Martin Scorsese, blurring lines of fantasy and a hyper-reality, to create one of the most emotionally challenging films in recent memory. Arthur Fleck, a lonely clown for hire and aspiring stand-up comedian, is trapped in a city and a world that doesn't care. The everyday apathy and cruelty he endures only antagonizing his worsening mental condition and affliction (he laughs painfully and uncontrollably when confronted, nervous or hurting.). He wants to fit in. He wants to be loved. He wants to be happy. The system has failed him. On reaching breaking point Arthur fights back, beginning a violent chain reaction that will ultimately lead to a catharsis, and a life changing metamorphosis...
While the additional cast are excellent throughout, the film is essentially a one man character study, and Joaquin Phoenix brings Arthur to vivid, heartbreaking life in every scene. It's a testimony to his ability that we more than empathize with the character, that despite his later deplorable actions, we understand and even except his reasons. Both Phillips and Phoenix pushing our expectations and our boundaries. 
As a result Joker will no doubt split regular audiences more used to a softer, purely fantastical approach to comic figures. But DC has long pushed the limits and explored darker, more adult themes in their graphic novels and even animated features. Alan Moore's 'The Killing Joke', Ed Brubaker's 'The Man Who Laughs' and Frank Millers 'The Dark Knight Returns' to name but a few. Since his inception as Batman's No.1 nemesis almost 80 years ago, every generation has reinvented and reinterpreted the Joker to fit with the times. It's telling that in 2019, this is the Joker we need and deserve... 
Mikey's Movie Rating: 5/5* 😎👌"
"Oct 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"A movie that deserves all the praise it gets. Joaquin Phoenix crushes his role as Arthur Fleck or ""Joker"" as he makes you feel Arthur's emotions throughout the entire film. Todd Phillips' camera work is impeccable as he makes the audience feel like this is a real life event and never fails to keep the audience from hanging on the edge of our seat."
"Oct 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is hauntingly beautiful. The music, the colors, the dialogues. We are all jokers and in this film you see how so many are formed."
"Oct 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Effortlessly iconic, and the vibe and mood for this film was tremendous. Delivering on such a complex character's personality and mood was no easy feat, but Joker succeeded at that and then some."
"Oct 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Joker, what can I say about this masterpiece? It's an excellent film, where we see Arthur being shaped by society, we see in the film how Gotham's social structure has enormous prejudice towards those who have mental problems. Mental problems are one of the key points of the plot. Joker, by Todd Phillips, is a film in which we have a deep character, with shaken social cycles, left in a city where the poorest serve as a carpet for the rich, we have Arthur, who suffers enough to the point of becoming the terror of that fragile society."
"Oct 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Una película perfecta en todo su esplendor, aveces DC Comics no decepciona en la hora de hacer estas películas. Una de las mejores películas de 2019 y una de las taquilleras de la historia de DC Comics. La actuación de Joaquín Phoenix es sin duda la mejor de toda su carrera y vaya que se tiene merecido ese Oscar a mejor actor."
"Oct 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"As I age, I tend to avoid superhero movies, but intrigued by the Oscars and positive reviews, I took a chance on this one. I'm thrilled I did. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal was brilliant, deserving of the Best Actor Oscar. The story, stunts, and direction were exceptional. Kudos to everyone involved in this fantastic film. Highly recommend!"
"Oct 7, 2023",POSITIVE,The character development in this movie is really good!
"Oct 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This is a pretty decent movie about mental health, is it a Joker movie... No, this has almost no relation to any of the comic stuff, I get that it's trying to be different, but honestly Arthur Fleck is no genius laughing mastermind, Joaquin is great though, it really got the message across that we live in a society."
"Oct 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this movie it shows what our social can cause and how we treat others best both the dark knight and Joker are the best movies that DC has made
"Oct 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love this movie. The way Joker was portrayed in this film is perfect, and realistic. It shows how Joker became Joker. Who was he? Joaquin Phoenix is a phenomenal actor, and did such an amazing job transforming into Joker."
"Oct 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazingly fresh and dark take on a classic DC comic book character. The movie is a slow burning masterpiece that fully delivers on its title JOKER.
"Oct 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Gave it a second watch, got so much better.
Do it too, you'll not regret it."
"Oct 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really wish that I could give this movie a TEN Stat rating!!! 

""The worst part about having a mental illness is that people expect you to behave as if you don't."" -Joker 

If you go into this movie expecting it to be a Batman/Joker superhero kind of movie, you may be a little bit disappointed. It's not that kind of thing, particularly! HOWEVER, I will say that the movie does a FANTASTIC job at speaking about and bringing light to the everyday challenges foe those of us who struggle with mental health needs, and the stigma that's behind it in society - particularly American society. 

It's not really a superhero movie, unless you believe in the ideation that villains are just heros of their own story (which I do)."
"Oct 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Es una buena película muy divertida un origen muy interesante es buenísima el humor es bueno el joker es Carismático y es gran película y me encanta el soudtrack es un 9.5 de 10
"Sep 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Had to watch it twice to confirm my initial thoughts. This movie is a masterpiece through and through. It's reveling as it is discomforting. The quirks and antics the infamous Joker possesses are given eye-opening meaning behind them which does take a level of maturity to be able to view the picture with more depth. You will feel a bit torn by the character Joaquin beautifully portrays but moved by the scenes and cinematic shots that take you with him. One of my top movies I'll have to say.
"Sep 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good movie, Idk will I watch it again, It started off slow, Then it start getting good, I like the joker, Joaquin Phoenix did great as the joker, It's sad all he went through his life before coming the joker, And its violent and bloody too, I heard part 2 coming in 2024,  3/5"
"Sep 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is great, as shown of how society has made a man turned into a villain and how he changed from a being normal comedian to now a chaotic villain as his origin story as perfect."
"Sep 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Love this film so much
"Sep 23, 2023",POSITIVE,A dark gritty movie that adds a lot to the joker character. And that staircase scene is golden.
"Sep 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Extremely overrated.
"Sep 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Es una de las mejores películas en estos últimos años y una buena historia
"Sep 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Escenas increíbles  de vida que empezaron con sonrisas ficticias y su realidad era la de una persona triste y con problemas emosionales de locura lo cual lo llevan hacer un excelente criminal.
"Sep 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Simplemente excelencia, muy buena adaptación de la demencia muy recomendable 👌"
"Sep 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Es buena actuación de joker
"Sep 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Que buena película ame cada minuto de la misma, expendida actuación del actor que da vida al joker"
"Sep 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The director cinematography & performance by Joaquin Phoenix is exceptional.  This is not an ""feel good"" movie.  It has a very dark storyline and touches on several gritty social issues."
"Sep 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The grimness and darkness of the film should be embraced. And Joaquin Phoenix's performance should be memorialized.
"Sep 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"In my humble opinion, this is probably the top 10, book movie of all time in the top three DC movies of all time because This is what The DCEU needed. More character driven stories to be honest, more elsewhere or not a movie that’s connected with the main universe type movie because this right here to me is a masterpiece. This is definitely a different interpretation of the Joker because if you look back, this was supposed to be Jared Leto’s joker having a standalone film, but that did not work because first the carrier did not have any compelling things that he can do on his own plus DC was trying to catch up with the MCU Since the NCU was popular made a lot of money and people wouldn’t stop talking about it but on this movie, this felt like a DC movie plus very inspired by Martin Scorseses King of comedy and taxi driver, but featuring the joker the reason that this my top 10 comic book movies of all time and possibly top three or top two DC movies of all time is because it’s character driven and make a sympathize on the insanity and the crazy personality of the Joker because this is a good evil movie meaning that this is another protagonist movie which I like movie We are placed in a point of view of how Gotham is tearing apart itself, and how Gotham is tearing apart our own characters, and the core reason why this movie works for me because the stuff that he doing we should not be on his side throughout this whole movie he’s killing he’s murdering His own “parent” He’s killing without remorse, but we don’t turn on him. We still are on his side because the people around him are making him be this way. The people around him is making him have the right to kill them because Treat him badly and how It represents Gotham on a daily basis, and that right there is something DC needs to learn to understand their characters. And the performance by Phoenix isn’t no heath ledger, but it’s up there with the best performances in comic book history overall, this movie is what dc is  all about, and the dark Knight, and the Batman, where is not trying to be like like other comic movies, or like the MCU, it is its own thing, more darker, more gritty, more deeper characters, and more deeper movies 10/10"
"Sep 17, 2023",POSITIVE,If you need to learn psychology in an easy way then this is a perfect study of a bipolar disorder.
"Sep 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Really? Maybe it's good I mean the actors definitely did a brilliant work but the plot is really suck. Everything when it is over-correct will go wrong to the other side.
"Sep 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely fantastic in every way. This was an incredibly fresh take in the superhero/villain genre—there are no unrealistic superpowers or flashy stunts. This made an iconic comic character relatable and enjoyable for people who aren't fans of the Marvel/DC comics and movies. It had significant plot twists randomly placed throughout the movie, which isn't a luxury many movies spoil you with. In my opinion, Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is supreme above all overs and will be for years to come."
"Sep 13, 2023",POSITIVE,GOAT acting by Joaquin Phoenix.
"Sep 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sure I'm a Marvel guy, but this has gotta be one of the best DC movies I've seen. Joaquin Phoenix nailed it."
"Sep 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Joker is a compelling masterpiece that explores the descent into madness of the iconic villain, the Joker, portrayed brilliantly by Joaquin Phoenix. Set in a bleak Gotham City, the film delves into societal issues and features outstanding cinematography and a haunting score. It's a character-driven narrative that challenges viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about society and human nature."
"Sep 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"The true unsettling reality lies not in the Joker's grotesquery, but in the unexpected sympathy you may find yourself feeling towards him, a sensation that can be profoundly unsettling."
"Sep 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Atemporal. Um filme lendário sobre um dos melhores e mais complexos vilões da cultura pop.
"Sep 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Great acting, but an unsatisfying conclusion and a completely ridiculous message."
"Sep 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"My favorite Joker since Ledger, Joaquin absolutely deserved that Oscar, I'm glad they're making a sequel because i want more of Joaquin as Joker instead of Arthur, he's really the perfect cast as Joker, pretty sure Arthur Fleck is just a fake story he made up to cover his real identity, since he's telling the story to the therapist in the end, it'd make sense because Joker always tell lies like when Ledger's joker said different stories about his scars."
"Sep 9, 2023",POSITIVE,This was the role of a lifetime for Joaquin Phoenix. The movie was very well done and it earned a great place in the Batman universe. I really liked how they touched on mental illness and how it impacts what the Joker does and who he is. I'm really looking forward to the sequel!
"Sep 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies in the last 20 years, hands down!

Do you love hero pics? Do you like dark movies? Do you understand mental break downs? Do you love amazing acting? Can you watch a movie over and over again? Add this to your list then!

From start to finish, I was in. I didn't want to look away and miss a single thing.

I don't read the comics so I don't know the background of many of these stories, so when the story is told to me through an incredible cinematic experience, I'm asking for a second date!

Cinematography, 10 points.

Joaquin Phoenix, 10 points.

Music, 10 points.

Overall story, 10 points.

Leaving you wanting more, 10 points.

Bring on part 2!"
"Sep 9, 2023",POSITIVE,I'm excited for the sequel.
"Sep 8, 2023",POSITIVE,disturbing in just the right way.  really well done drama. does not feel like a comic book movie. I am not at all into comic book /superhero movies in general but I loved this. great cinematography and soundtrack.
"Sep 8, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a masterpiece
"Sep 7, 2023",POSITIVE,An astounding piece of art!
"Sep 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,Fucking shit movie the worst dc movie of all time
"Sep 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I never understand the hate for this movie. This is cinema
"Sep 4, 2023",POSITIVE,That's Why he's the GOAT THE GOAT!!!
"Sep 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Dark. And J. Phoenix played the heck out of that role
"Sep 3, 2023",POSITIVE,A sensational film.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times.  An amazing   performance by Joaquin Pheonix.  Must watch :)
"Sep 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie! Absolutely loved it! Make part 2 asap!
"Sep 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"oscar is not enough for phoenix, he created and carried a masterpiece"
"Sep 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's hard to give an imperfect film 5 - stars but the Joker comes so close. What does it to take to be a supervillain, especially one who isn't motivated purely by money and power? Phoenix's Joker isn't an anarchist but a more of a niellist.  There's no Batman to give him purpose here, so instead his stand-in is a society, specifically capitalist society played by Thomas Wayne. What happens to the people at the bottom of this system? There's no one answer but some live with their families in an RV down my street, trying to make it as ""normal"" as they can for their kids. Others steal packages or cars off the same street, others steal so their families can eat. Ans once in a while someone comes along who has radically different views of the inherent laws and rule the system assumes (yet really only apply to these people new lower tiers).  The Joker is a period piece that sometimes looks like the not so distant future. As I walked out of the theater I wonder what freaks me out more: A person like Fleck, or the person who came out of the theater with no empathy for him."
"Aug 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Joker isn't the kind of character that's supposed to have his own movie, he's supposed to be mysterious and you can make up whatever backstory about him that you want because he's been represented so many ways in so many different formats that the options are limitless, so giving him his own movie and giving him HOLLYWOOD'S backstory ruins that and eliminates our imagination entirely, whilst at the same time attempting to be creative and new and imaginative! Yes, in Tim Burton's ""Batman"", we did learn about the joker and his backstory, which annoyed me, but at least it wasn't the prime focus of the entire film! It doesn't even HAVE a focus, because it's just a goofy-looking clown going evil! We don't want to see Joker go evil like we saw Darth Vader go evil, we want to see him be evil. Do evil. In this movie, all he does is BECOME evil. The idea of the Joker is that he IS evil! He doesn't develop his evil, he's just naturally evil and the rest, including his backstory, is up to us! I don't know if you'll agree, but I seriously despise this movie."
"Aug 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very over hyped this joker is a pathetic gamma male quite far from the source material.
"Aug 28, 2023",POSITIVE,An instant classic. SO good picture.
"Aug 27, 2023",POSITIVE,It is so freaking awesome.
"Aug 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Joker? I hardly know her!
"Aug 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Best joker since Heath. I love the backstory. Incredible. Deserves a second movie.
"Aug 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Joaquin acted his bussy off this was really really great but definitely not a movie for rewatching
"Aug 22, 2023",POSITIVE,So good u had to watch it 3 times!
"Aug 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Muito bom, com uma atuação memoravel de Joaquin Phoenix, trilha sonora e fotografia sendo dirigida de forma linda e um filme que consegue entregar tudo aquilo que promete."
"Aug 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow what a movie I came in this movie thinking it's gonna be mid and weird but this movie is actually great wow wow wow joker is the best dc movie since the dark knight this movie may be dark and uncomfortable but that's what make it special this movie deserved the Oscar it got in 2019 and the movie is emotional and inspiring this is what dc movies should be emotional and inspiring not griddy and funny this movie is even better than the first Wonder Woman movie and it's on the same level as Batman begins overall this movie is amazing and emotional 


Rating: 9.5/10"
"Aug 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal as an abused, mentally ill psychopath was chilling. The origin story was fantastic, although we have had a look at how Joker became the Joker in previous stories relating to Batman, this was a fun vision by the Director Todd  Philips and the Writers Todd Philips, Scott Silver and Bob Kane to bring this iconic DC character to the screen in a new adaptation was refreshing, fun and disturbing. The mark of Joker was definitely hit with this film. With a 2 hour and 2 minute runtime the pacing is fast and the story flows perfectly."
"Aug 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I would've rated this higher but I can't take bloody movies like this. Besides that, the movie was good and the actor was AMAZING. I wish I could rate it higher but no, the blood messes me up. Sorry. Especially the part where he kills the man with the scissors."
"Aug 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Hospital didnt go BOOM BOOM, movie sucks. SCAM!"
"Aug 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"A lead up to Arthur's reason for becoming the Joker is worth seeing for
Joaquin Phoenix's Oscar performance!
Like a nightmare it sticks with you after you have seen the movie and can't shake off what you saw!"
"Aug 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Rewatched it. Reloved it. It's seriously a brilliant slow burn
"Aug 9, 2023",POSITIVE,The joker movie is going to take the rotten ass and it deserves the seal of best fucking movie Go fucking Go fucking
"Aug 9, 2023",POSITIVE,I absolutely love this movie. Yes it was slow at first that was because we needed to meet the man behind the makeup first.
"Aug 6, 2023",POSITIVE,I really want to see a Joker 2.
"Aug 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,It had amazing acting but the plot is horrendous. Having a solo joker movie especially without Batman is pretty hard to make work and this movie just further proves that.  Despite this movie having the best acting I have ever seen in a movie the story is weak and a little boring.  This movie could have been a masterpiece with the actors they chose but it's not just acting that makes a movie good it's also how it is written. It is just too predictable.
"Jul 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Some movies are ahead of their time. 'Joker' may be the greatest movie to release behind its time. To start, 'Joker' is an almost perfect film if viewed in a vacuum. As far as a realistic story of how one of the most infamous villains ever put to page, the movie is incredible. Particularly influenced by Taxi Driver, 'Joker' thrives on portraying the (admittedly extreme) consequences of a society that undervalues the needed investment in the resources dedicated to the public's mental health. Unfortunately, 'Joker' released in the 'meme' era, and was ultimately subjected to both moral evisceration (some of which was fair), and extremist promotion (an instance of appropriation, a common enough tactic by such group). The acting is fantastic across the board, from Joaquin Phoenix' slowly unraveling Arthur Fleck, to De Niro's exploitative generic late-night show host, the on point acting makes the movie enthralling from start to finish. Controversial, brilliant, a casualty of the culture wars, Joker stands tall next to the other greatest comic book films like Logan and The Dark Knight."
"Jul 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've only had the chance to watch this like two or three times, but I did not expect to like the plot at all! I rarely watch DC films voluntarily for I am more of a Marvel girl, but Arthur's story was just too moving to ignore."
"Jul 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"JOKER is cinematic art at it's absolute finest. The direction by Todd Phillips is on point with gorgeous cinematography echoing the work of Darius Khondji in 'se7en' . Low camera angles and wide shots capture Gotham City as I've never seen it, whilst all the time focusing on its lead character. 
  And actor, Joaquin Phoenix deserves all the praise being lauded upon him. His slow burning transition from Arthur Fleck to the titular character is at times, uncomfortable viewing... but what else would we expect it to be?

  Is it fair to judge his performance next to Heath Ledger? Of course, fans and critics will do with every Joker incarnation, past, present and future. 
  But Arthur Fleck is Phoenix's character, and for the little time we view him as the Joker, Ledger fans won't be dissatisfied; it is almost a homage from Phoenix to the late actor and is an accomplishment of the highest standard.

  Does the film warrant it's UK rating of 15? Given the content of the themes explored, I would label the rating as being tame.
  This deserves an 18 restriction.
  The violence we see on screen is not glorified, but brutal and deservedly so. This isn't a movie directed for those easily concerned with social apathy or fears of anarchy. The tone of the film is unsettling and will leave a lasting expression on those who view it... and in closing, isn't that what we, as the audience, expect a movie to do?"
"Jul 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Most brilliant character study since “Taxi Driver.” Phoenix deserved every award he received. He is the most talented actor of his generation. I feel as if he prepared for this particular role his entire life. River would have been so proud. 
"Jul 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Joaquin Phoenix's mesmerizing performance as the iconic villain, combined with Todd Phillips' bold direction, creates a gripping character study that delves into the depths of madness and society's darker aspects. The film's thought-provoking narrative, stunning cinematography, and impeccable score make it an unforgettable and impactful experience that challenges viewers to confront the complexities of the human psyche."
"Jul 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Stunning. DC at its absolute finest.
"Jul 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie was dark and creepy, and I liked it a lot. Although it's not perfect, it was well-made. This was a great Joker movie for sure."
"Jul 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfect casting + beautiful cinematography
"Jul 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Still to this day my absoloute favourite movie!! Cannot wait for no.2
"Jul 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Just one of the most amazing movies such good acting from both pheonix and de niro
"Jul 21, 2023",POSITIVE,If you enjoy an uneasy sense of dread.  A must watch.
"Jul 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Joaquin deserved best actor for this
"Jul 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Gud muvie, sadly it wasn't about funny clowns . ."
"Jul 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing dark story that's a must watch! Philips crushed it with this one and it's not even a comedy. The story was amazing the drama was gripping and the acting was perfect please Todd make us another
"Jul 14, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is an absolute masterpiece with a breathtaking performance from Joaquin Phoenix. Arthur is frighteningly relatable and the audience goes through his pain and madness vicariously in a way that can be truly difficult to watch at times.
"Jul 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A realistic and gritty take on DCs most iconic villains. The inclusion of mental health issues, instead of the usual toxic chemicals that turns the Joker into the Joker, makes this version feel a bit more terrifying and real."
"Jul 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"8/10
Me gusta mucho esta peli. Lo primero de todo, el Joker es un villano, loco y excéntrico cuyo propósito del personaje es tomarse la justicia con su propia mano mediante la ultraviolencia y el caos, por lo tanto no creo que nadie pueda tomar de ejemplo a seguir y yo creo que muchos lo estáis confundiendo. Gran producción y gran reparto, me encanta Joaquin Phoenix y Oscar totalmente merecido a este gran actor que ya lo mereció anteriormente."
"Jul 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,Really crazy dramatized movie. Slowly watching him go crazy. Pretty shocking ending and I wasn't expecting it.
"Jul 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie I've seen a true masterpiece and never seen something like it beast story really digs in
"Jul 5, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is a Masterpiece! Joaquin Phoenix is the GOAT (Greatest of All Time). I'm looking forward to the sequel 'Joker: Folie à Deux'.
"Jul 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Pure art. Absolutely phenomenal
"Jul 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Haunting, psychological, realistic, and extremely well thought out. This is exactly what superhero movies in the modern era are aiming for, and often times missing. This one hits, and hits hard. When I first heard they were doing a Joker origin story I figured it would be terrible. Then, I saw the trailer and thought, ""okay, that looks interesting but I'll bet they crammed all the best parts into this 3 minute trailer and now the feature length film will be riddled with problems."" I was wrong. It's great all the way through."
"Jul 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a lover of Batman movies in general, Joker ranks as a favourite. I love that Joker gets his own movie and it's a great origin story of Batmans greatest villain. A must see!"
"Jul 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie slapped. Make more like it please.
"Jun 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Truly amazing movie. It's only a few years old but it already feels iconic.
"Jun 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Todd Phillips really made a handful of raunchy comedys and then this beautiful masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix plays such a convincing lonely misunderstood guy. The fact that he actually lost 50 pounds to play Joker is fucking amazing. Joaquin Phoenix really can act his weight off. I've owned Joker for 4 years but I never got around to watching it. Now that I have, I think what I always think: Why didn't I watch this sooner?"
"Jun 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Damn..... Just out of words for this so accurate depiction of the class difference going on in the world, An Absolutely Must Watch"
"Jun 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"To the people who don't think this movie has much to say, I repeat the final lines, ""you wouldn't get it."""
"Jun 27, 2023",POSITIVE,So dark. Maybe the darkest movie I’ve seen. Was very well acted and the story was compelling. I honestly feel bad for liking it but it was very well made. It did a good job of making you feel bad for Joker but also hating him. It is not a good movie for people who are sensitive to dark material and violence.
"Jun 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"saw this last friday and wow... what a masterpiece. such a well-rounded movie, with exceptional character development (and I don't mean it in a good way, obviously) and so much charisma. it got me feeling so sad but, at the same time, I couldn't stop watching. I seriously wasn't expecting for it to be so deep - regardless of what everyone always told me about. this has become one of my favorite movies, for sure."
"Jun 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie to watch even if you are not a DC fan.
"Jun 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Okay, where do I begin with this one? The psychological analysis is amazing and great in depth. It was what DC is about. The film goes in depth in the psychology of one of the greatest villains in Comic history. At first, I swore up and down no one was better than Heath Ledger's Joker from Dark Knight. It really is done well."
"Jun 22, 2023",POSITIVE,A fantastic and depressing character study of one of the most famous and twisted villans in the comicbook universe. Not a date movie.
"Jun 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,To much drama need fighting scene
"Jun 17, 2023",POSITIVE,When i watched this movie i expected a joker like from the Dark Knight. But what i got is even better in every sense. Rather than just being a comic book movie  this addressed more of the social issues people face everyday. And the way they tell his story is iconic. This is a movie that has a place in my heart. Joaquin Phoenix deserved the Oscar for movie nothing less. If he didn't win the Oscar after this movie i would have called oscar rigged.
"Jun 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie has some amazing themes and messages, and keeps you entertained and thinking throughout the movie. This is the kind of movie that you want to watch over and over again. In my opinion, this movie is the best rendition of the Joker ever (yes, ever)."
"Jun 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"joker is a masterpiece, the quintessential dc movie
violent, dramatic but a film that is very much to its own, it is entertaining due to its humor and a good way to follow the story but it is a humor that does not clash and it is not for what it shines or is taken very prominently in the film if not for a good script, performances and characters and as the movie progresses it gets stronger and you feel the story with legendary moments like the dance on the stairs."
"Jun 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Es la mejor pelicula de dc de la década pasada. Con una excelente actuación de Joaquin Phoenix
"Jun 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Joaquin's performance was perfect as arthur and Joker , It really deserved the oscar"
"Jun 15, 2023",POSITIVE,My favourite movie of that year. Worth a watch
"Jun 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"With lots of jokes, dark humor, and mental health talks. It's understanding of the mentality one and the mental declining"
"Jun 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow!  What an intense and unique way to portray the Joker.   Phoenix really went for it
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing Joker origin film
"Jun 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,Far exceeded my expectation and I am not typically a huge batman series fan!
"Jun 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is mainly about mental illness. It is very dark and gruesome and it works so well with this character. I love the score, the acting, the cinematography, and everything else in between."
"Jun 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie to watch it more than once. It's not perfect, but probably will make you think about today's world for a while."
"Jun 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Sehr ergreifend. Joaquin Phoenix ist einer der besten Schauspieler!
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Joker is a darker, more serious take on the character. Todd Phillips does an outstanding job as director, creating an atmosphere that fits the story well while weaving in commentary about our own culture today. Joaquin Phoenix plays the part of the Joker extremely well, with an engaging performance that makes it impossible to look away."
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,👍👍👍👍👍👍🤯🤯🤯🤯
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"O meu filme de 2019... Fantástico, com uma actuação fabulosa do Joaquim. Maravilhoso."
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Bem melhor do que eu esperava.
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Grasping performance and mesmerising story.
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Interesting and engaging movie, hope they do more with this character/this background story."
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's good, but I'm traumatized."
"Jun 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Joaquin is such a great actor, love him."

"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Certainly a great movie, but the lack of quality films coming out over the past decade resulted in overrating and overreaction to Joker. Joaquin Phoenix was terrific, as usual, but it lacked the pop of the great classic Batman films that the character was born into. A strong film and must-watch regardless"
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I used this film for an English project and I got 100%/A+. The highest in the class. Thank you Joker, we truly do live in a society."
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Ich konnte meine Augen keine Sekunde abwenden. Die Kamera folgt ausschließlich einer Person und die macht ihren Job absolut grandios. Ein skurriles Drama mit Herz und Wahnsinn
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Much, much better than I expected. What a movie, loved it"
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed watching and I hope there Is a sequel
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bleak and miserable, although Phoenix is outstanding in the titular role."
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"An amazing charcater study of a character that we thought we knew, but indeed do not. Beautifully shot, edited and acted ESPECIALLY Joaquin Phoenix. His Oscar win was unquestionable. Todd Phillips knocked it out of the park with showing us how society can shape a monster out of those who need our help. You really do feel for Arthur and begin to understand why he is the way he his with still grappling the fact that he has become villainous Joker."
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,LOVE THE DARKNESS WE NEED MORE OF THIS EVERYTHING AINT FOR KIDS
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent piece. Few movies tell a story from the villains perspective well. Joker exceeds
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Truly a masterpiece, nothing will top this storytelling of DC comics greatest villain ever.
Combined with great acting, direction, script and so on... It will take a lot to top this in the future."
"May 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Que vaina tan mala. Aburrida, ridícula y carente de contexto y trama. Con todo respeto la actuación da pena ajena de lo ridículo e incoherente que a veces es. Esta demasiada sobrevalorada. Que perdida de tiempo haberla visto"
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Esta película es una obra de arte
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Like looking in a mirror for so many people.
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"For the life of me I will never understand why some people don't like this movie. It's dark, but fantastic in every way."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"o filme é uma aula de arco traumático. 
Simplesmente excepcional"
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love this movie, it is one of my favorites, it doesnt have a lot of horror, but there is blood involved in one or two scenes towards the end of the movie. There are also adult jokes and comedy and for some people it might not be so funny since they don't understand the joke yet. But this is a very great movie overall!! And i love the plot."
"May 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Spoiler Alert!! Full disclosure, I stopped watching at 37 minutes, I just couldn't take any more of the gloom, doom and hate. I thought this movie sucked. Maybe I saw a different movie from the one that everyone else saw, because I saw a film that was dark and depressing, had no one that I cared about and actually if they had all died, I wouldn't have cared. The city is disgusting, covered in graffiti, filled with hateful people who steal and attack at the drop of a hat, from street thugs to men in suits on the subway, no one seems to have any morality. If Batman is supposed to be controlling crime in Gotham, he is horrible at his job. I found no way to feel sorrow for the JOKER or anyone else in the movie. If anything, it proved to me that NOT living in the city, any city, was the best decision I ever made."
"May 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,This was supposed to blow my mind?
"May 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"A masterpiece. It took me a few minutes to realize, that this movie is not exactly what I expected. But after realizing that the performance of Joaquin Phoenix litterally pushed me into the seat and shouted to me ""sit, watch and endure my suffering!"". 
Brilliant drama!"
"May 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Joaquin Phoenix, in another outstanding performance."
"May 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I like dark and depressing movies, but this one... it's a bit too much for my taste. The mental ilness joker has feels a little off (and actually is several mental ilnesses combined together). The acting and overall story are great. The first part of the movie is a too long to a point where you already know everything but the conversation is only in half so you have to sit the rest of it through."
"May 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Story: great(a lot of inpairation from taxi driver) acting: some of the best. joker is one of the best comic book movies ever made and a just great movie in general. 5 stars great!
"May 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Great acting by Pheonix. Loved the slow meaningful scenes as well as the chaotic ones. Really made it feel like you were attached to the character.
"May 5, 2023",POSITIVE,This was outstanding. I had low expectations and it blew them out of the water. Phoenix was amazing 
"May 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I watched this movie when it first came out, and back then, it would've been a perfect 5/5 for me. However, thanks to the internet making memes out of the best moments, It ruined my opinion of the movie, and now I can't take it seriously anymore.

I still consider this movie really good, despite my less-serious look at it nowadays. It's a movie that feels very real, and has a lot of topics that hit home with me, due to how corruption runs through every part of my life."
"May 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Muy buena. Se explica el por qué del personaje y las tomas son muy buenas.
"May 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Very dark movie but really well made and acted.
"Apr 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"3個很喜歡的地方
1.瓦昆·菲尼克斯的演技超好
2.很喜歡用跳舞來詮釋心情
3.什麼片段是真，什麼片段是假，很值得回味與深思"
"Apr 27, 2023",POSITIVE,The Joker it's hard for me to criticis art. When it so good really shows what how people get to that point. The cicity brings you down. The rich stay rich The poor stays poor. There is no silvery any no kind words to say. I love the clown 🤡.hahahah
"Apr 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,the fact that so many people sincerely gave this movie 5 stars is discouraging. i beg you to watch more movies not made by disney corporation
"Apr 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is such an incredibe masterpiece. The acting is incredible and the storyline is very intersting and it always keeps you on the edge of your seat, this is also mostly cause of the acting. I love the directing and the script. One of the best movies ever"
"Apr 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"A must-see for any and all Shark Tale fans. I believe this film may even be BASED off Shark Tale itself. I found the Joker to be VERY SIMILAR to Shark Tales protagonist, Oscar. Could this film secretly be the human version of Shark Tale? I think it could be. The parallels are undebatable. This film is the ULTIMATE inspiration for sigmas such as myself. When I see The Joker (or should i call him Oscar now?) I see a role model, someone to look up to. I hope i can see myself in them both one day. 
Yours faithfully,
-Shark Tale fan 001"
"Apr 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of the 21st century so far
"Apr 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I know it's late but I have to write this. The movie itself is incredible. Phoenix does a phenomenal job on the joker. Second best behind heath ledger but you can't stop ledger now can you. The story being told from jokers lens when you really don't get any other lens and scenes made up in his mind that later make you go, ""oh that makes sense now"". Exploring the more sensitive and vulnerable side of the joker and giving him a more ""human"" approach was perfect. You can sympathize with him a lot of the time and feel bad for him with all he goes through. A great movie with almost perfect acting."
"Apr 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Esse filme é bem dramatico, mostrando um lado real do coringa, uma outra forma de ve-lo.
A drama do filme foi muito boa, e mostra como o mundo tem uma divisão social muito evidente, e como o dinheiro afeta nos dias de hoje."
"Apr 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well-acted, ""Joker"" is a dark character study about an iconic comic-book villain."
"Apr 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie manages to capture the essence of the character in a way that no other adaptation has been able to do before. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Joker is absolutely outstanding, and it's clear that he put a lot of effort into bringing this iconic character to life. One of the things I appreciated about this movie was the way it explored the character's backstory. It was interesting to see how the Joker became the person he is, and how his experiences shaped his worldview. The film also does an excellent job of examining the societal issues that contributed to the Joker's descent into madness, making it a thought-provoking watch."
"Apr 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sólo puedo decir que nunca había visto en el cine retratada de manera tan artera la enfermedad mental. Phoenix es extraordinario. Nunca pensé ver a mi hermano esquizofrénico retratado en el cine, con todo su dolor, su drama, su soledad, su anhelo. La vi en el cine y lloré profundamente. Al día siguiente, mi hermano había muerto. Tal vez deba verla otra vez, aunque me duela volver a ella."
"Apr 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing. Real. Tragic.
"Apr 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a great film. Joker is dark and realistic, IMO it's the best DC film since the Dark Knight trilogy. Joaquin Phoenix transforms himself and gives a powerful performance that makes you feel terrified by him and sad for him at the same time, he really deserved that oscar. Robert De Niro also gives a great performance, the scene near the end of the film with him and Phoenix is very intense. If you haven't seen this yet give it a go! If you enjoy darker superhero films or thrillers, you should enjoy this."
"Apr 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Yo no era gran fan de ver las películas y series en idioma original, pero después de ver esta gran actuación me cambio la vida por completo. La película en si tiene un desarrollo del Joker desde un punto de vista mucho más humano desde que es una persona ""común"" hasta llegar al ""loquito"" que todos conocemos."
"Apr 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"As of this review, my personal favorite movie."
"Apr 8, 2023",POSITIVE,so sollten bösewichte dargestellt sein .... egal wie kaputt herr phenix auch ist ... er ist ein genialer schauspieler und somit auch perfekt für den joker. freue mich schon auf teil 2.
"Apr 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Just watch it. It's an Oscar performance from Phoenix in a movie made on a shoestring budget that delivered a masterpiece of acting.
"Apr 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie gave a good story on how Joker became Joker, but it was depressing as hell."
"Apr 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ain't no way they did this to cocaine bear. I mean WHAT THE FUCK! Cocaine bear and 65 gave me hope that this franchise was finally on the right path but apparently NOT! Just because Joapin Phoenix played brother bear does not mean he has to ruin cocaine bear! This movie also wrecks the timeline by having it set in the 1970's, when 65 clearly set up that the franchise would happen long before humankind. And why, just why did they try to establish mark whalberg as Thomas Wayne, and cocaine bears FATHER?!!?! Not as bad as rocket man, but still one of the worst movies of all time"
"Apr 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A realistic take on a very complicated villain, the portrayal of the Joker's mental health and its decline and also the way society treats certain types of people were fascinating to watch."
"Apr 5, 2023",POSITIVE,It's A Amazing Masterpiece
"Apr 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie was good, but i feel it's using just Joker's name as reference. It has very little connection with actual character. In my opinion there shouldn't be any Joker related stuff for next 10+ years, it's just that Ledger did it so good it's irreplaceable in everyone's minds. Phoenix did a good job but it's just not that character, he plays someone else who tries to be Joker."
"Apr 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, amazing origin story. Don't listen to the critics, they're wrong and biased. This movie is excellent and truly shows why Joker is the Joker or a version of him at least."
"Apr 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Un filme que plasma perfectamente el realismo político-social que acompañada de una trama y guion psicologicamente oscura que gracias a la gran actuación de Joaquin Phoenix transmite todo lo que se plantea ,JOKER es intrigante y emocionalmente tensa que te deja con un shock reflexivo de la sociedad donde vivimos."
"Mar 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Six stars. How critics have the nerve to give less than 90%… The acting, plot and climactic build up should have propelled it to the best film Oscar. A film to break your heart as well as summon up anger. Truly prophetic"
"Mar 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just when you think you've seen as good an origin movie as you're ever likely to see, along comes this. Phoenix is mesmerising and acts the hell out of his role. It's a very different comic book adaptation that has more in common with Taxi Driver than the Batman franchise. It beautifully shows the disintegration of both the lead character and the broken society that in a sense created him. Powerful stuff."
"Mar 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'd rate it a 0, but it won't let me."
"Mar 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Masterpiece. Utter perfection. 
"Mar 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Esta es una verdadera pelicula de como un protagonista sufre por tantos años que se combierte en un villano.
"Mar 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Everything I want in a good movie!
Phoenix delivers one of his best performances of his life, the story is amazing and dark, the score is haunting but also very beautiful and the cinematography creates such a perfectly fitting atmosphere for everything else."
"Mar 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"A surprisingly well-acted and well-written story, Joker tells the tale of the origin of Batman's greatest nemesis. Joaquin Phoenix is an absolute force, balancing between completely unhinged and grounded simultaneously. His character's story is, obviously, central to the plot- but not in a way that one might expect. Instead of showing us the Joker's early days of crime, viewers are treated to the days even earlier than that when Arthur Fleck (the real name for the infamous villain) struggles with mental illness amid a world that couldn't care less whether he lived or died. And that's where Joker gets its real grit and nuance from- the idea that mental illness is something that can be, and should be, ignored. In its mythos Gotham, as a city, is protected by the Waynes, but the reality is much more bleak. Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) runs for Mayor amid his lavish excesses, a race that itself is lavish, while the underbelly of Gotham continues to swell which leads to Joker's thesis argument: That it's the rich and not the poor, downtrodden, and sick of Gotham that are in fact ruining the city. The one percent continues to party while the rest of us are left to rot with no consideration for what that might mean. These pieces set the scene for a more sympathetic and understandable Joker, one whose madness has reason. Phoenix is joined by the always-excellent Zazie Beetz as Sophie, Arthur's neighbor who is perfectly cast and whose story is perfectly paced. The only stumble in this otherwise excellent film is its need to try and shoehorn Bruce Wayne into the project, which it does towards the two-thirds mark. There really isn't any added quality with regard to childhood Bruce, and thankfully the scene doesn't overextend its already lukewarm welcome. Viewers know the universe that they're inhabiting, they don't need such an on-the-nose reminder. Joker still manages to be a force with a relatable angle for the most unrelatable villain in comic book history. Come for Joaquin Phoenix's triumphant performance, but stay for the surprisingly deep message at the core of this ""superhero"" film."
"Mar 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"A dog getting kicked enough will eventually bite back. 

That is this movie in a nutshell. It portrays mental illness through multiple lenses, gives a thorough breakdown of the character's change, all while giving you feelings of both sympathy and disgust at the main character's actions. 

The score and cinematography are top-level that just adds to the overall disturbing atmosphere of this movie."
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is perfect! It's dark, strong, painful to watch. We are able to see why joker is what he is!"
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Joachim is so good that he that he totally disappears into the character. The movie is overwhelming and totally unexpected in so many ways. The biggest surprise it's how it approachs mental health issues and how makes you want to support joker, fully understanding where his ""villain"" features are coming.
The movie made feel so many things, that I couldn't re-watch it again."
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfeito. Sem exagero algum
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,A beautifully tragic film. It's hard to watch at times and triggered a strong emotional reaction for me.
"Mar 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I adore this film. One of the best films I've ever seen. Absolutely recommend this one. Jaquin Phoenix is brilliant. I geniunly felt sorry for the character. All in all, brilliant. This is an absolute must watch. Brilliant."
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great version of a Joker story. Dramatic, realistic, dark. Not the one you expect from 'comic superhero villain story', but the one that deeper in all aspects."
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,I like it its so good movie
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Perfect in every aspect.

Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife. Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting. Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message. It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too. The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different. It's BELIEVABLE. There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people. Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film."
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Joker is a very hard movie to love. It is an incredible movie with outstanding elements but like many other great films, such as Whiplash, I'm not sure how inclined I'd be to watch it again. I am so glad I did watch it but due to the slow nature and how un-uplifting it is (I'm making that a word), I don't think I'd rush out to see it again. I am, however, looking forward to the sequel and any other follow-ups that may be made. I would definitely recommend it to fans of the character or of the Batman universe. If what I've talked about makes you interested in the film, then I would also certainly recommend it. However, I feel it is my duty to warn viewers of the very dark and gruesome moments."
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,An amazing character study for the Joker and every performance is immaculate.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such a fun experiment for a comic book character. Todd Philips delivers with an amazing character journey. Joker is a melancholic and eye-opening tale about what someone who suffers from a mental condition has to go through everday emotionally and physically. As the story progresses, we can see how society treats these people and what becomes of them."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,love it. great story.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Let the weird kid sit with you at lunch.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Do i even have to say anything its the best movie ever.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Joker is just amazing
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Tense AF.  Not sure why critics don't like it.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Creepy in its own way of how realistic this could be, Joker is a suspenseful, dark, serious movie and  Joaquin Phoenix's performance is horrifying in its own way."
"Feb 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I seriously don't get it !  I tried I really did. And this movie it awful . I don't understand why people love it , I don't understand why there's an upcoming sequel.  I'm sorry I just don't get it !"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"increíble, un antes y después en el genero de superhéroes."
"Feb 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Joker's trailer made it look like it was going to be a good movie; however, it was not. 

This is the movie that switched me from a DC fan to a Marvel fan. If the ticket hadn't been so expensive, I would have left before the end.
To my barely educated mind this movie was dangerously insulting to people who have not only mental health challenges but learning disabilities."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"After having several versions of the Joker, I thought that one more would be absurd. However, Joaquín Phoenix arrived with Todd Phillips and they shut my mouth."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really good, superhero fatigue is setting in and sick of seeing crazy scenes. 
Great, simple enjoyable story from start to finish."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of the year!!
"Feb 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,A very well acted movie with weak writing. The back story for how he becomes Joker is weak and the story line is trivial and unengaging but Joaquin does play it very well.
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme muito bom, logo nos segundos do filme você sente que o filme vai entregar uma coisa extraordinária❤️🤡"
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film is extraordinary, for me it has no flaws I have watched it more than 12 times and it is certainly the best film ever created together with taxi driver, spectacular photography, impeccable direction, very good acting Joaquim Phoenix is ​​a very good actor he deserved the Oscar for sure and the songs that move the heart, story of a true drama a reality in our society and for me 10/10"
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,The Movie is a CLASSIC! Worth owning & watching again & again! Truly a Great Movie…
"Feb 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Una radiografía casi perfecta a la sociedad, además, concientiza de la creación de ""la gente mala"" y la importancia del contexto cultural histórico en esto."
"Feb 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"jOAQUIN´S Perfomance was stellar, oscar dewserving, he ate and left no crumbs, Pur."
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Speaks to the heart of the modern, downtrodden Man. A prophetic warning. That's why many dislike this movie."
"Feb 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's slow and drawn out, relying on some interesting themes but if it wasn't for the past reputation of the cast, I don't think people would be rating this movie as highly."
"Feb 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,Did I watch the same movie all these five star ratings have posted? One of the worst movies I've ever watched.
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Outstanding movie. Best actor performance in years. Engaging, well written and paced. Best joker ever."
"Feb 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst movie i have ever watched by far
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,The performance of Joaquin Phoenix in this movie is masterpiece!
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix definitely deserved those awards for his performance.
"Feb 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Llamarla Joker es un insulto a cualquier fan del personaje, su parecido al personaje del comic, básicamente se basa en el maquillaje y la vestimenta y hay termina todo. Si la hubiesen llamado ""Juanito el Loco"" no tendría nada que objetar, es más incluso diria que es una buena película de autor.
Una actuación impresionante de Joaquín Phoenix de un personaje, patético y pusilánime que nada tiene que ver con el Príncipe payaso.
En fin total decepción para fanáticos de los comics de Batman y gran película para gente que lo más cerca que ha estado de un cómic de dicho personaje es cuando pasa a visitar los padres de su sobrino friki."
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,A whimsical sense of craft that hits deeper than a black hole in your heart. Truly a work of art.
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,HAHAAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHHAHAAHHAA
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Not at all what I expected and absolutely brilliant.
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,There is always going to be 1 joker that I like better but this was .01 from being my favorite great movie
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Brilliantly done and great performance. I loved the realism and how well the actor for Joker handled this role.
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"um filme incrível subestimado pela crítica, um sucesso vindo da dc que não só é um filme sobre hq mas que funcionaria como uma história que é parcialmente indpirada em quadrinhos, mas sem uma história cliche e sem alma como nos filmes de heroi de hoje"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It was extremely impacting and messed up. Honestly I think it's the best movie I have ever seen.
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movie. Seeing the Jokers perspective led to quite an amazing movie. I wanted a movie like this for so long. Dark but the perfect level of dark.
"Jan 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I find the film very drawn out in places, but watchable. It's a kind of marmite film where I'm sitting on the fence"
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"a grown up phycological look into the joker and how anyone in this society can easily be pushed into being the villain by this uncaring world.

official critics likely hate it because they think it glamorises villains and that is dangerous... but they totally missed the point that it shows societies failings and how if we made society a better more truly caring place then we can prevent anyone from ever becoming a villain with proper care and psychological help. the joker sends a positive message, but most critics seem to have missed the point."
"Jan 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie actually sucked so bad. I don't know why it got so much love. Prob because Joaquin Phoenix is the lead. A bunch of weird cringy joker laughs and a boring story with little to no action. The only decently cool part was the subway/train fight.
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just go watch the movie already, then you'll understand why it's 5/5 stars"
"Jan 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ik vind te film en beetje saai een veel geweld zit er niet in er zijn veel films die meer geweld Toon dan Joker
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great movie when it comes to acting and understanding the personality of an already established caracter. As a honest representation of the Joker, Joaquin Phoenix does a job that's only comparable to Heath Ledger and his legendary interpretation in Dark Knight. Though the script could've had a better viewing on mental disorders, Todd Philips (well known for his comedy movies) and Scott Silver did and great job at putting their foot on the drama world and capturing the major points on depression and schizophrenia, despite being a little stereotypical. On the techinical side, filmography and sound design are very solid and overall add to the movie. A quality reimagining of an already known fictional world, Joker is not just another two hour time-waster like DC's well-known failures in the world of heroes, but a successful establishment of a new universe to be admired."
"Jan 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Um filme violento que trás um história interessante de como o coringa virou o coringa! Com um ator tão bom quanto Joaquin Phoenix, é óbvio que ele ganharia
um Oscar com essa obra de arte. Trilha sonora boa e calmante para um filme tão
excitante. Mas é um filme que nós acabamos nos simpatizando com o protagonista
louco em vez de falarmos que ele está errado! E é nisso que esse filme peca."
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"incredible, interesting twist on the origin of the joker without ignoring his pre existing qualities"
"Jan 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Basically, a Scorsese rip off where Phoenix clamors desperately for an Oscar for 2 hours. While the character of The Joker can certainly be done in an intriguing way, I think we've gotten to the point where clown characters compel gullible audiences to buy tickets. If the character of The Joker in this film was just Aurthor Fleck, and didn't wear clown makeup, well, it'd be kind of a skip-it affair, I think. But since he decides to wear clown makeup and call himself The Joker, and this is Gotham City, people clamor for it. I guess I just don't get the hype and don't feel that the film stands up on its own feet outside of the lore of the comics. I also find it kind of hard to swallow that this version of the Joker could become the criminal that takes on The Batman. This version was more straight up insane than insane and brilliant i.e., Ledger and Nicolson versions.  Overall, this is an extremely overrated affair and really quite boring."
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely crazy movie
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,if you dont like this movie- you don't like me. this world is so cruel idk how more people are villanous.
"Jan 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I know most people loved the movie but it left me unimpressed. It had questionable scenes and only the end of the movie was worth watching. I think the Joker is better suited for an action movie like the dark knight, where I could see how menacing, cunning and unpredictable he would be."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing Acting and amazing plot. Among my favorite movies. You can really connect to the Joker, as it clearly explaining, while not justifying his violence."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfect realistic interpretation of the character.
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Very interesting take on the Joker. Very dark and depressing. Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic in this. I don´t think this is one I will ever watch again. Not because it´s bad...it´s not. But the movie really drags you down.
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Esse filme é muito bom e meio violento e mas é legal da as vezes pra sentir o ódio do personagem esse filme e top
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"I watched this for the first time the other day and I couldn't understand why this movie got so much hate upon its release. This film does a great job of showcasing what makes Joker, Joker. Although, it doesn't give the viewers a clear way of how they should feel about Joker but I assume that was intentional and left up to the viewers of whether they sympathize with him or not."
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"I actually am joker, i am very connected to this movie."
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Without bombast and exaggerated cgi simply a good story told and staged. Outstanding interpretation of the Joker by Joaquin Phoenix.
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,Masterpiece. One of the greatest movies ever made
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,brutally honest on the cusp my dawh
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"El propósito de la película es representar como es la sociedad actualmente con todos somos indiferentes con todos y por eso surgen cosas como las peleas entre naciones, la película logra ese propósito de la mano de una excelente historia y actuaciones en especial la de su protagonista Joaquín Phoenix y la conexión que tiene con Batman es la cereza del pastel para la perfección de este proyecto..."
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Best prequal/ origin story ever.
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Throughly enjoyed this movie beginning till end. Emotional and creative movie. You really felt for this character. Well made overall.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Baita de um filmaço a grande atuação do Joaquim Fênix trilha sonora impecável desenvolvimento de personagem muito fotografia linda
"Dec 19, 2022",POSITIVE,"The explanation of mental instability due to the environment was such a crucial part that made this movie shed light on how many people out there could be fighting the same or close to issues in their lives. JOKER might have lost to his mental illness and led himself to where he ended in the movie, but to those out there, that battle you are going through will hopefully be won by you. The film says ""You Are NOT Alone"" in every language. Keep fighting, seek help, and perhaps one moment, this war will be off, and you will be better. Stay strong. The movie explained it to us, so you shall relax now."
"Dec 18, 2022",NEUTRAL,"It's a spectacular performance by Joaquin Phoenix, but it's slow and depressing AF. Not for me."
"Dec 17, 2022",POSITIVE,"Maybe not for everyone, but this film is a high art. Some will understand it in a deeper way than others, based on life experiences. I'm glad they made this."
"Dec 12, 2022",NEGATIVE,"If you like dancing, and smoking? And dancing while smoking? Then you will love this movie!"
"Dec 9, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Wonderful performance by Phoenix. The story was good but too drawn out. I did enjoy it and was filmed perfectly, just the story felt hollow. "
"Dec 7, 2022",POSITIVE,"Amazing film , loved it , the acting was class , it was a film you couldn't  stop watching .."
"Nov 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"The movie is a sort of psychoanalysis of this joker's mind, very well interpreted by Phoenix.
In fact we dive so deep into his consciousness that we are no longer able to distinguish whats real from what is not and almost like in a modern psychoanalytic book we can't really trust the protagonist's unstable perspective to determine the reality of the facts. The story is however very catchy and hearthbreaking, the sets are all nicely done and the concept of weaker joker, still in development of his character is something almost new. This movie certainly contains a subtle but undeniable criticism to modern society, especially towards the upper middle classes who sometimes feel superior towards the lower ones. The bad thing about this movie for me was that sometimes it made the character a bit too pathetic and insignificant but apart from that its brilliant"
"Nov 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,Didn't care for this movie.
"Nov 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"So gritty and often genuinely moving that when you are, occasionally, asked to suspend disbelief so that the ""comic book"" plot can advance itself it comes as a bit of a shock.  Tremendous performance from Joaquin Phoenix and Robert de Niro isn't half bad either."
"Nov 23, 2022",POSITIVE,After heath his 2nd perfact joker 🃏
"Nov 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"This film is a masterpiece to watch! Joaquin Pheonix portrays the Joker in a way that makes you feel pity for the character and at the same time, you want to hate him. This film is absolutely perfect, and I would highly recommend watching it!
Rated: 5/5"
"Nov 21, 2022",POSITIVE,A very unique and tragic take on the iconic DC Comics character. Its layered storytelling allows for multiple interpretations.

"Nov 18, 2022",POSITIVE,"Fantastic movie. Straight forward yet great story. Excellent acted, excellent directed. This is how you movie."
"Nov 16, 2022",POSITIVE,ripped off taxi driver and made it very slightly better.
"Nov 16, 2022",POSITIVE,"The way this film portrays mental illness and one's decline into it with a BRILLIANTLY stunning performance from Joaquin Phoenix, directing and writing that makes you shocked and uncomfortable (in a surprisingly good way) every step of the way, all of it is just too good. This is one of the top movies of 2019 hands down. A sequel would come off as an insult to this film."
"Nov 13, 2022",POSITIVE,One of the best films released in the last few years. The fall of The Joker in this is amazing.
"Nov 13, 2022",NEUTRAL,"The Joker is a thrilling yet chilling experience. It is unique, and for that it is a solid film. The plot is a bit exaggerated, but it is still a good film."
"Nov 12, 2022",NEGATIVE,Really didn't enjoy this version of the The Joker and how it relates to the Batman story as I thought it dragged on and didn't seem relevant plus too much shooting & violence when he had a gun.
"Nov 11, 2022",POSITIVE,The Best movie made everrrr
"Nov 9, 2022",POSITIVE,This movie was amazing and a masterpiece. This would be the perfect origin story for Joker and I give this film a 10/10.
"Nov 8, 2022",POSITIVE,"I find it funny how companies like Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB give such low ratings on this movie as it ""promotes"" violence. The movie itself is a masterpiece and should be adored. It provides such clear acting work from Joaquin Phoenix as his co-actors. The precision in story telling, and details for the environment is mesmerizing. 

A must-see for those who haven't been able to see it yet."
"Nov 6, 2022",POSITIVE,"Depicts a grim reality so remarkably well.
Joaquin Phoenix is exquisite.
The movie is utterly astonishing all around."
"Nov 3, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I walked out the first time I went to see it. I went alone and a friend text me asking if I wanted to meet for lunch and I was thrilled to have a reason not to stay. I decided to give it a second chance, thinking maybe it was just a mood I was in. I went with a friend that time, and had I gone alone, I would've walked out again. I don't get the hype for this movie at all."
"Nov 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Joker is a tragedy told expertly, however it tends to slog through its midsection and may leave you wanting more."
"Oct 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"Joaquin Pheonix's take on The Joker character is something I love. He isn't The Joker as you'd originally think of. He isn't a character who I could see taking on a future type of Batman of any type, but as a take for an alternative Joker origin story I really like it.
This is a very human take on the character and the fact that there are people out there with the same mindset as Arthur Fleck helps to make it more believable and human. This version of the character is not evil incarnate, though he does do pretty awful things you do understand where the desire and his mindset come from even if you don't agree with the actions he takes. The performance of Joaquin Pheonix is still honestly amazing and honestly if you don't care for the movie and its contents most can agree Joaquin Pheonix provided a beautiful performance."
"Oct 31, 2022",POSITIVE,Gorgeous movie for beginning to end. And awesome performance by joaquin phoenix
"Oct 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"one of the greatest movies ever, and Phoenix's acting is possibly the best ever"
"Oct 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"A worthy oponent to Ledger, a battle of gods"
"Oct 29, 2022",POSITIVE,One thing DC universe will always get right is their villains. Truly captures the complexity of human psychology and how the environment has such a tremendous impact in it.
"Oct 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Absolutely brilliant 👏 different type of comic book film 🎥
"Oct 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie! Well acted, great cinematography, and thought out plot. It is very thought provoking and incredibly entertaining."
"Oct 26, 2022",POSITIVE,This happened to my buddy Eric once
"Oct 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Entertaining movie, highly recommended"
"Oct 26, 2022",POSITIVE,Another blockbuster DC movie loved it and words can't describe how good this is Robert de Niro put his all and loved seeing him in here
"Oct 25, 2022",POSITIVE,Joker was a good character study movie.   Joaquin Phoenix gave it his all.   The main problem (but not really a problem because that's what it seemed they were going for) was that it drug out like a 1970's drama.   I mean that as a good and bad thing.   70's dramas were big on character development but the second act always seemed like they drug on.   That was this movie.  You had a lot of character development and you felt his pain as he went through the movie but the second act seemed like it went forever.   I would still say go see it.
"Oct 25, 2022",POSITIVE,the bast joker. Joaquin Phoenix was absolutely amazing in this film
"Oct 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"Dark, booding and excellent. Really shows how the Joker, could legitimately become the clown prince!"
"Oct 24, 2022",NEUTRAL,"As many have said, has lots of echoes of Taxi Driver and others, but is still captivating and moves along quickly, you want to see what will happen next."
"Oct 22, 2022",POSITIVE,A perfect movie for the right audience
"Oct 22, 2022",NEGATIVE,"This didn't have anything to do with any character you might be familiar with called ""Joker"". Joaquin Phoenix has a good performance as a mentally ill street performer. Some people used to seeing the usual comic book fare were perhaps tricked into seeing a mature, well-done film, hence the critic-audience discrepancy on scoring. Critics understand it's pretty run-of-the-mill, but people not used to such films, it must have seemed ground-breaking. Anyway, I would have given it 4 stars, if not for what was essentially false advertising."
"Oct 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Brilhante. Será eternizado como uma das melhores adaptações de quadrinhos.
"Oct 21, 2022",POSITIVE,O melhor vilão de todos os tempos consegue manter um filme facilmente. Adorei demais e vale a pena ver.
"Oct 21, 2022",NEUTRAL,Joker gives its infamous central character a chillingly plausible origin story that serves as a brilliant showcase for its star -- and a dark evolution for comics-inspired cinema.
"Oct 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"10/10 
Phenomenal performance!"
"Oct 21, 2022",POSITIVE,This new vision of the clown prince of crime reflects on how downtrodden and tough our society has always been. Special mention to the outstanding performance of Phoenix.
"Oct 20, 2022",POSITIVE,It's an amazing movie that shows an accurate origin story of The Joker. A for sure must watch for DC comic book fans.
"Oct 19, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Eh, not a bad movie by any means. Worth a try. I don't know if anyone will be a better Joker than Heath Ledger in my eyes though."
"Oct 18, 2022",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies i have ever seen! Great story and the acting is so, so good."
"Oct 18, 2022",POSITIVE,"The combination of Phoenix plus storyline re-imagined are what really make this special. A 'superhero' movie that feels compelling and real for once, like stepping into a dark 70's time capsule of history. The realness is embedded into Phoenix, as the Joker transcends from comic book icon to a real person struggling with their mental health. The final act delivers in full. My only gripe is I wish it was longer or a mini-series."
"Oct 16, 2022",POSITIVE,"Grim-dark miserable, with what felt like some provocative commentary on the genuinely terrible way much of society treats non-neuro-typicals. Unsure, but end-scene may have been a meta-joke tied to the beginning scene of the Dark Knight series, showing that 'The Joker' was not the villain that Bruce Wayne saw murdering his father. Hard to watch, compelling."
"Oct 15, 2022",POSITIVE,"Joker is not different from Batman, he wants his revenge on the society he lives in and maybe that's why he needs him. They represent two point of view, on Joker's side the enemies are the leaders and everyone who's seen as mentor or idol, they influenced the society and made it what it is and as result of it he wants to take their place as the one that should be listened. From Batman's experience it's the opposite, Bruce can still see the hope that Arthur lost."
"Oct 15, 2022",POSITIVE,Dunno What critics were looking for But This Movie is A Masterpiece fr..phoenix as Joker is just perfect..Even Nit comic accurate it's still a good movie shows the reality of this world
"Oct 15, 2022",POSITIVE,sometimes The Critics Are wrong....This movie is a Physical Masterpiece
"Oct 14, 2022",POSITIVE,a masterpiece that got abused by critics but revived by users
"Oct 14, 2022",POSITIVE,"An instant classic. Joaquin Phoenix was incredible, as well as the rest of the cast. The writing was *chef's kiss*"
"Oct 12, 2022",POSITIVE,"simply one of the best if not the best origin story for a comic book character. the current one in Phoenix is ​​fabulous, which combined with a very precise and human script manages to hook you!"
"Oct 10, 2022",POSITIVE,"it is not a film for film critics sitting in their tesla cars outside hollywood mansions. This movie is not for you, its for the people who work to afford a ticket for a movie such as this."
"Oct 8, 2022",NEUTRAL,"This interpretation of the joker is pretty impressive, the story Brings a strong continuity, great characters and a strong concept. Although it does flatline in certain scenes, consider it minor traffic on a highway, the film holds strong, personally I felt that I could have been more true to the original Jokers lore, where he was dubbed the king of crimes, this pivotal role however falls on Joaquin's Joker as a form of conceptual fate, more so not as manic as the original. Lastly, there was so much more that could have made the film better, the artistic dancing and self face-downs could have taken a seat on the bench, it almost makes it as a completely brand new never before imagined Joker, which I though was refreshing to say the least, there's only one problem, it was never broken in the first place."
"Oct 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Director Tim Miller manages to intrigue us with the much different comic-book centered movie, way different than the funny, self-centered and violent film Deadpool in 2016. By being darker, more serious and more self-reflected, Joker manges to be an entertaining comic-book inspired drama while being different altogether. The direction is great, the themes are fabolous, the violent is real and the performance by Joaquin Phoenix is amongst the best of the year as well as his best performance to date. The writing is a bit off at times and the movie's first half is slow, but its second half makes that first half go into your backbone"
"Oct 5, 2022",POSITIVE,"Excellent writing, directing and acting. What else could you ask for? Almost no CGI in the best comic book movie ever."
"Oct 2, 2022",POSITIVE,"An amazing psychological thriller, a movie so terrifying even without the blood and gore. So intense…"
"Sep 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"Best movie I've ever watched. Joaquin Phoenix does an outstanding job playing Joker.  Compared to Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight, he does a great job representing the emotional part of Joker. In comparison, Heath Ledger does a great job with the violent role of Joker. They both did a great job with this role, and I can't wait to see Joker: Folie à Deux!!!"
"Sep 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"This is probably the best movie in a long time since ""Arrival"" that I had to watch in the cinema, allthough I went from a cinema lover to a cinema hater. I love movies though and good movies are rare nowadays. Love this and want to see more in this Joker-universe. Thumbs up!"
"Sep 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Fantastic story telling and characters
"Sep 28, 2022",NEUTRAL,"There's no denying Joker's strengths: Todd Phillips' gritty 1980s New York City is immersive, and Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of a creepy loner turned maniacal clown is perhaps a career best for him.  That said, it's hard to tell what the point of this movie is.  It goes to pains to show that an uncaring and judgmental society will let down its vulnerable members, risking turning them into monsters.  Yet the tone feels intent on elevating the Joker to some sort of hero or role model -- never mind the fact that he's a violent and unstable murderer, someone ready to drag society down into chaos rather than put in the work to fix its shortcomings.  One wonders if the legions of fanboys with Joker posters hanging on dorm walls will come away thinking the government should expand funding for mental health services, or maybe engage that sad loner on a bus in pleasant conversation, or if they'd rather just pump their fists at the idea of a madman making the world worse.  My bet is on the latter, and for that reason I struggle to find redeeming qualities in this film."
"Sep 28, 2022",POSITIVE,Very different movie for me. Joaquin Phoenix did a great job and was a very likable Joker. Thoroughly enjoyed his performance.
"Sep 26, 2022",POSITIVE,best of DC movie and why you give it 60 why it so good not marvel can make a movie like joker that good ok to be good to beat anything marvel has too :D
"Sep 25, 2022",POSITIVE,A fantastic performance by Joaquin Phoenix
"Sep 24, 2022",POSITIVE,Finally a Joker movie.
"Sep 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"Joker is not your typical comic book film. It is a deep, violent, gritty psychological character study delving into the mind of Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill man who has only ever wanted to make people laugh, to bring colour and joy to the world, but who has been beaten down again and again until he can take no more, and his life takes a downward spiral when he lashes back at his attackers. I love this film This is one of those film that's performances will make the film or break it. The writing, whilst a little rocky in a few places, is still solid throughout, and when it shines, it _really_ shines. This film would not be the same without Joaquin Phoenix's electrifying performance as Arthur Fleck, absolutely outshining everything else in this movie. Phoenix really put his all into the role, to the point that he is no longer playing the Joker. He is the Joker. Phoenix can and does run through depressed, angry, relieved, happy all in a minute, with nothing more than inflections in his voice and his facial expressions. The little details make it all the better. Watch out for a scene I call, ""How about another joke, Murray?"". That scene is the definition of an Oscar worthy performance. The movie grips you from start to finish, it manages to take a man who kills without remorse and make you feel for him. This movie isn't trying to make you happy, to make you laugh, it wants to make you uncomfortable, scared, angry and it succeeds at all of these from beginning to end.  You will sit down and instantly feel uncomfortable. As the film progresses you will feel sympathetic for Arthur getting beaten down by everyone around him, you will leave feeling empty. This film perfectly embodies the famous quote,
""We all can go insane with just one bad day."" If you can handle violence and dark themes and are at all interested in this film, I recommend you trust your instincts and give it a watch as soon as possible. You will not regret it."
"Sep 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"Joaquins acting is incredible, script is kinda meh"
"Sep 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,I pity the fool that liked this movie. Its real wrong.
"Sep 17, 2022",POSITIVE,Incredible performance by Joaquin Phoenix.
"Sep 14, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great movie, no doubt. Even if critics dumps it just for political correctness as always."
"Sep 14, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Doesn’t really feel like the Joker at any point in the movie. I feel like it tries too hard to get you to understand the Joker instead of just telling the “origin” story. But Phoenix delivers a solid performance and if you don’t mind the fact that this character will never make it into a Batman movie, it’s worth a watch."
"Sep 13, 2022",POSITIVE,Brilliant! An awesome new take on the already shrouded in mystery character.
"Sep 13, 2022",NEUTRAL,Buena pero esperaba más.
"Sep 11, 2022",POSITIVE,"Joker is unique and the production value is fantastic. Acting is otherworldly, and I love it. Very well done!"
"Sep 11, 2022",POSITIVE,Finally something that feels widely new. Outstanding acting as a cherry on top.
"Sep 11, 2022",POSITIVE,One of the greatest movie of all time
"Sep 9, 2022",NEUTRAL,"While this film does feel like a few Martin Scorsese such as Taxi Driver I would still recommend watching this since it gives a interesting origin story about the Joker instead of falling into a vat of chemicals & becoming insane, society is the one who shapes the Joker by basically teaching him being a terrible person is funny & acceptable so he becomes the worst person ever to become the funniest person ever which was his dream to become a good comedian."
"Sep 9, 2022",POSITIVE,"Buenísima, con una buena historia de origen, con grandes actores y actrices, una gran evolución de personaje y lo mejor, es que no es aburrida y repetitiva, realmente así se deben hacer las pelis de personajes tan importantes, y conocidos, como lo es el joker"
"Sep 9, 2022",POSITIVE,"it's a beautiful movie horribly misrepresented by the critic reviews. A story of dwindling mental health and systematic issues/pressure in America. Also is funny at times and sad at others, and thrilling all the time. A must see."
"Sep 8, 2022",POSITIVE,"Second best comic movie. Incredible how the best comic book movies are batman related. Great character development and incredible acting, worth to point out the taxi driver inspiration on this movie, and amazing ending. Cant wait for the sequel, the idea of a sequel is bad but i have faith in the director."
"Sep 8, 2022",POSITIVE,absolutely great. Joaquin phoenix is outstanding. great movie that reminds me of the way Scorsese used to make movies
"Sep 7, 2022",POSITIVE,An amazing movie depicting a man and his decent into madness and his loss of touch with reality
"Sep 6, 2022",POSITIVE,"Haunting. I keep wanting to re-watch it, but it was painfully good and I don't know if I want to put myself through that."
"Sep 6, 2022",POSITIVE,Powerful and emotional painful to watch. Joker is a dark gritty film with its powerful acting performance by Joaquin Phoenix that give Joker a meaning and a movie worth remembering.
"Sep 5, 2022",POSITIVE,"I usually don't enjoy films which attempt to explain why villains became villains; it just doesn't interest me. This film was an exception to that though, as I found Joker an amazing character study into this version of the iconic villain. Great acting, good plot, and some nice dialogue made this a must see movie."
"Sep 4, 2022",POSITIVE,"I finally had the time to sit and absorb everything in this film.
From inside the mind of mental illness and a spiral downward.
Much like falling down, everything in this film immerses you in the time, place, and social decay.
This is one of Joaquin's finest character studies. 
The cinematography drives an almost POV experience."
"Sep 3, 2022",POSITIVE,"This movie is remarkable, a true masterpiece. The writing and pace of the movie are perfect. As for Joaquin Phoenix, he proves once again that he is probably the number 1 actor in Hollywood."
"Sep 3, 2022",POSITIVE,"Хороший реалистичный фильм. Учитесь, Марвел, хотя такое вы вряд ли сделаете."
"Sep 3, 2022",POSITIVE,"This needs six stars, so here's that sixth star."
"Sep 2, 2022",POSITIVE,The fact that rotten tomatoes gave joker such a low score is a joke in itself. Enough said
"Sep 2, 2022",POSITIVE,I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It casts a much needed light on the nihilism of modern society and the need for the unheard to be heard. Basket of deplorables are people too
"Sep 2, 2022",POSITIVE,Es una joya. Me parece muy atinado que por primera vez dejarón de hacer a un Joker caricaturizado. Eso le dió más realismo al personaje
"Sep 1, 2022",POSITIVE,"This is a brilliant character drama with a top performance from Joaquin Phoenix, although I am very aware of the criticisms its received and I do see how people could be concerned about it either/both glamorising bloody violence in general and also linking mental illness to physical violence. One of the main criticisms I felt is that while the characters background is looked at, I feel it leaves the viewers with far too many unanswered questions and its the enigma aspect that makes him someone to be so fearful of. It doesn't help people with mental illness to be seen, yet again, as people to be fearful of, people who must be unbalanced and ready to attack at a moments notice.

The feeling of uncertainty, of some form of impending sudden movement, is present throughout. Its certainly a gripping watch, its relatively tense and edgy too, as should be expected, of course. There's an operatic/choreographed flair type element to said characters public appearances, which appears to come naturally to the actor, Joaquin. Its a good film - quite atmospheric and engrossing. This isn't a film for youngish teenagers, its quite gritty and bleak, hence the 15 rating but thats perhaps to be expected(?).  Its much less a superhero film in the traditional sense but again thats perhaps to be expected. Its a film well worth seeing if you know what to expect, in which case then yes I would recommend it."
"Sep 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,Overrated; this movie is more a statement on American culture than it is a compelling story. A rehash of Taxi Driver with an equally great performance delivered by Joaquin I got the impression that the film was trying to piggyback off the popularity of the Joker character without creating a compelling case. Would have been better as a standalone story not based on the Gotham universe. Great acting but poor writing.
"Sep 1, 2022",POSITIVE,Pure art. the site made me add more words.
"Aug 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"A forma como a personagem evolui é simplesmente perfeita. E sob aspectos de fotografia, contexto, personagens, tudo perfeito. Alguns detalhes são fantásticos, como a origem da risada descontrolada e sem sentido do coringa, que pra mim passou a fazer todo o sentido depois desse filme. Na minha opinião é um filme impecável e o melhor do universo Batman."
"Aug 28, 2022",POSITIVE,No n and moon is lord king lord
"Aug 26, 2022",NEGATIVE,"It made me feel justification for how the Joker acted in the future.  Poor guy!  The part I couldn't get past was that he is stupidly thin.  In later Batman movies, Joker is strong and muscular, hence how he can fight.  Overall interesting, but I felt it wasn't something I wished I had taken the time to watch."
"Aug 25, 2022",POSITIVE,"The greatest 02 hours: and 02 minutes of gunplay, stabbings, and deaths!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Aug 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Super boring movie. It was a very real take on the schizophrenic persona of Joker but absolutely slow from the start with a terrible ending. I think they were trying for something different and they nailed it, just didn't nail what people want to see, at least not what I wanted to see."
"Aug 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"This is one of the absolute best DC movie I think that I have ever seen, the story is absolutely amazing, the way the Phoenix played Joker is absolutely heartbreaking. The soundtrack is soul-touching, and the sequal-bait ending just begs for another Joker movie, or another movie that takes place after this masterpiece! An absolute must watch for all!"
"Aug 23, 2022",POSITIVE,It was a very different take on Joker and one that deserves multiple watches. He without a doubt earned his Oscar for this role. I wish they'd do the whole DC universe like this cause it completely takes away any perception of a corny superhero movie and treats it with a level of respectful seriousness no superhero movie ever has attempted to do before.
"Jul 1, 2020",POSITIVE,"Pheonix's portrayal of Joker is chilling precisely because he embellishes so little, and unlike Heath Ledger's unbelievably cunning and charismatic Joker, we are left to believe that a man (or many men) with the same thoughts and history as Arthur Fleck actually exist(s) in the real world. He's the opposite of a super-villain-- there's clearly nothing super about him. Moreover, the movie is not even about him, but the undeniably raw social conditions that produce him. Public spending cuts force Arthur to lose his therapy and medicine. He and others live in grinding poverty and constant anxiety. There are no social resources for them to turn to for help. It's a dark, cruel social condition we know today as capitalist realism. As we see, the only logical solution is revolution."
"Jul 1, 2020",POSITIVE,"Pretty amazing cinematography and an incredible score, but Joaquin Phoenix was most definitely the star of the show, in one of the greatest performances this decade. I was disappointed in Todd Phillips directing, but the writing was pretty good, and overall, I recommend."
"Jun 28, 2020",NEUTRAL,"It's pretty good.  I'm not quite sure where the Joker goes from sympathetic to not in my mind, but it happens somewhat imperceptibly as the film goes by.  I enjoyed watching it, and am glad I did so.

But that said the hype from some quarters about this seems a bit over the top to me.  Somewhat above average but it's not going to blow your socks off or anything."
"Jun 28, 2020",POSITIVE,"Joker Story: The origin tale of the Joker (Joaquin Phoenix) – one of the most iconic villains in comic book history.
Joker Review: Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) isn't happy with his life. He struggles to make money as a part-time clown while sharing a rundown apartment with his ailing mom (Frances Conroy). But Arthur lives in a city struck by hard times where a decent, honest living is difficult to come by. He also suffers from a condition that causes him to break into uncontrollable laughter. None of this stops Arthur from dreaming big. He aspires to be a stand-up comedian and attempts to write jokes in his diary. Caught in between it all, Arthur slowly begins to lose his grip on sanity.
It's immediately apparent that this is not your standard comic book fare. Todd Phillips painstakingly constructs the story of a man at his wit's end when pushed beyond his breaking point. Phillips doesn't glorify mental illness but instead makes a compelling case of a deeply disturbed individual struggling to find a coping mechanism in the form of an unhinged alter ego. This also resonates in his gritty vision of Gotham City, a metropolis brought to its knees, and crime is just a way of life. Only the rich and corrupt seem to be unaffected by the mayhem – a pertinent notion in present times. Set in the early 80's, this fictional city is reminiscent of that era with impeccable production and a time-relevant, yet unsettling soundtrack that evokes a constant sense of uneasiness.
Arthur Fleck's gradual descent into madness has a distant parallel to ‘Taxi Driver', also featuring Robert De Niro, so there's a sense of joy for the cinephile to see him here. But, none of the cast holds a candle to Joaquin Phoenix in the titular role, captured by a dedicated and immersive performance. Watching Phoenix disappear into character makes one fear the actor's sanity as he creates his own unique version of the villain. At first, his wiry, awkward frame stumbles to get from one place to the next, but when he eventually transforms, he becomes graceful, resembling an agile dancer. It's simultaneously difficult to watch and yet, impossible to take your eyes off him. If Joaquin Phoenix finally wins an Academy Award for this performance, it will be hard to argue against it. Disturbing and intense, yet undeniably brilliant, this may very well become the definitive origin tale of the Joker."
"Jun 28, 2020",POSITIVE,"Gotham City has always represented the worst of America's urban cities. To my knowledge, Todd Phillips' Joker is the first of the Gotham based films to explore how this DC Comics city is a breeding ground for homicidal maniacs. It's mesmerizing, disturbing and, while not for everyone, a masterpiece."
"Jun 28, 2020",NEGATIVE,I should have spent 2 hours watching paint dry. A struggle to watch all the way through. Not entertaining at all. 
"Jun 27, 2020",NEGATIVE,"Two hours one decent scene, a real good way to waste time. Phoenix could have made a decent joker but instead it's should have been labeled ""mad clown"" or ""Mad World"" focusing on the background of the joker could have been an interesting story with interesting twists and turns. To even consider this as part of the DC family is the real ""JOKER""."
"Jun 27, 2020",POSITIVE,i'll give DC credit when there not trying to be Marvel they can make some damn good movies
"Jun 27, 2020",NEGATIVE,"This is the most reprehensible garbage to ever come out of Hollywood.  It glorifies mob violence.  It exhorts murder with headlines that literally scream ""KILL THE RICH"".  I seriously hope these BLM and antifa mobs make their way to the tony enclaves of Beverly Hills, so the people who have created this culture of destruction, mob violence and cultural insanity can reap all that they so richly deserve."
"Jun 27, 2020",NEUTRAL,"The story's a little quick, and the downfall of Gotham's elite isn't touched upon nearly enough, but Phoenix's frightening and beautiful performance make this film better than it is. It's not the Joker form the comics, it's not the Joker from The Dark Knight, but it's a Joker that'll go down in history as being one of the best big screen adaptations of the character."
"Jun 27, 2020",POSITIVE,Credit goes to the outstanding acting......An asset in my lifetime
"Jun 26, 2020",NEGATIVE,"Very bad movie, the movie doesn't make sense, everything happens in favor of the protagonist. Also it has nothing to do with the joker"
"Jun 26, 2020",NEGATIVE,"A whole lotta hysterical laughing, spontaneus killing and frivolous anarchy with an unplausible protagonist."
"Jun 26, 2020",POSITIVE,GREAT WATCH IT NOW....
"Jun 26, 2020",POSITIVE,I can see why this movie got so many Oscar nominations. This is the type of movie that the Academy loves to nominate and reward. But this movie actually deserves it. Everything is done beautifully and is executed perfectly. The highlight of this movie is without a doubt Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Arthur Fleck. 100% deserved the Oscar win. The other thing that really stood out to me in this movie was its music score. It matched the movie's tone perfectly and the way that it created tension in a scene was perfect. This movie may have its dark moments at times but it's definitely a piece art that deserves all of its praise.
"Jun 25, 2020",POSITIVE,Modern day masterpiece. Honestly one of the best films I've ever seen. Emotional rollercoaster with great twists.
"Jun 24, 2020",POSITIVE,Joker is fantastic and amazing. Joaquin Phoenix and Robert De Niro are amazing.
"Jun 24, 2020",POSITIVE,"Not really being into DC comics or their characters, I liked this movie a lot."
"Jun 22, 2020",POSITIVE,It's was emotionally sad and happy o felt like I was the Joker and understood what he was feeling
"Jun 22, 2020",NEGATIVE,"Meh, it passed the time is right on the money.  I would never watch it again, no wonder it was up for so many awards it was over all pretty boring and slow movie"
"Mar 1, 2020",POSITIVE,"I saw the (mostly negative) reviews in the big newspapers (NYT, WP, etc) and websites long ago when the movie came out, but I just rewatched it and just wanted to share my two cents. 

Joker has been wildly criticized. A common reason of criticism was the  claim that association between mental illness and violence sends the wrong message about both. 

Personally, I think we tend to overlook subtleties and jump to conclusions that are hard-and-fast, black and white. There's a difference between understanding the reasons behind a behavior and justifying it. Joker does a wonderful job at the former: we get the bigger picture, we see where he is coming from, and have light on the whys behind his actions. 

Yes, Joker does embody the dangerous result of a sick mind and an alienating society, as he says it so well just before killing Murray. His actions, atrocious as they are, do not invalidate this fact. 

Another point refers to the generalization of violent behavior. Obviously, not everyone who is mentally ill is a potential murderer, but everyone who is mentally ill in a society that does not offer support is extra vulnerable to becoming violent, if the wrong combinations are at play. What is art if not a portrait of real life? So the movie does a great job bringing the issue up. 

Again, it is not about justifying  Joker's actions. It's  about understanding and empathizing with the history, but not the action. It's about understanding and about NOT condoning the behavior. I got out of it with so many insights, but I believe these can be lost in the fleeting moment critics fall prey to their own knee-jerk reactions to violence and biases. Joker's actions are understandable given his circumstances, but that doesn't mean they are justified and I think that's the point the movie tried to make. 

I appreciated the acting, the soundtrack and the overall development of the character, ever so slowly but surely, into the maniac. 

Phoenix definitely deserved the Oscar."
"Mar 1, 2020",POSITIVE,"Wow! Just wow! Where can I start?  Is an amazing piece of cinema, great acting, great cgi and cinematography"
"Mar 1, 2020",POSITIVE,Joaquin delivers a brilliant and moving performance.
"Mar 1, 2020",NEUTRAL,"Watch as Arthur divolves into madness, brilliant dc comic backstory on the demented joker."
"Feb 29, 2020",POSITIVE,"Oh god, the Joker. What a masterclass in filmmaking, mood, acting, the dance of the camera, the play of colours and textures and gripping music. Todd Phillips has created something so powerful, so compelling that you can't help at marvel at it as a piece of cinema. Of course this is Joaquin Phoenix's moment of glory, like all his previous acting roles weren't already right up there with the best on screen performances, here he takes it up another notch, maybe to the top notch. The pain and trouble behind his eyes can only be awed at.

I found myself not wanting this film to end, I love the way we intimately see his journey and every incident and knock back, every heart wrenching glimpse of sadness of this tormented soul stoking the fire of not only his demise but also his rise. He made us feel a release through the imagery of killing his own mother, he allowed us in to his hopelessly lost mind where a different kind of sense actually made sense. Phoenix had me glued to the screen, I didn't even want to miss any it to go to the toilet.

There was so much to love about the production design, the bleakness of it, the hardness of it and the use of lighting to give a grade to the film as opposed to it being graded and colour washed heavily after the fact. Really nice use of CGI to augment the city scenes and make it dank and dystopian. The quant mix of old and new technology to create a parallel but alternate universe. None of this seemed out of place, it all went into creating a seamless whole and the viewer was totally sucked into this world and bought into it without question despite the quirkiness and asynchronous nature, no doubt adding to the overall feel of uneasiness and tension.

I think you either get this film or you don't. The message here was clearly one of mental health and not only the health of an individual but the health of a nation as a result of the attitude to the central theme. The slow boiling of the main character with no let up or relapse, just a continual build of tension throughout the piece, leaving you unsure of what could happen next and who was at risk around Fleck as he proceeded to his climatic scene where he finally found his audience, the one he'd been craving his whole life. The crushing sense of defeat too as he went about his daily life added even more and piled on the immense sense of dread and sadness felt by Fleck. The maintenance and the slow build of this film is where the masterful direction of Phillips is so apparent. Forget the politics, this was a huge billboard of a message, shining the light and showing the plight of those who suffer from mental illness no matter how big or small.

The cinematography, man, I couldn't tell you much about it other than it was flawless and unnoticeable - in the best way. There were some lovely scenes that really took your breath but most of the time it just supported the story and that's the most you can ask of your photographer - to assist and add to the story telling and not to detract from it. The sense of darkness and dread I felt were perfectly married with the lighting and mood of the piece. For a tale that was originally a comic book storyline featuring gaudy characters who never really had much character, this shows you what can be achieved in the right hands from such an almost insignificant starting point of reference. Sure, Heath Ledger did a brilliantly good job in the Nolan reboot, but for me, Phoenix wiped the floor with Ledgers performance and elevated it to the stratosphere in The Joker. It takes a special team of people to pull off such a great film and I can't wait to see what these guys get up to next. I hate sequels but I'd love to see more of this story."
"Feb 29, 2020",POSITIVE,"The Joker movie is a 2019 year psychological thriller. The film is an origin story for Batman's greatest nemesis, starring Joaquin Phoenix as a man called Arthur Fleck, who struggles with the weight of his mental illness and a miserable existence. Inside the misunderstood man lives a sadistic and psychopathic murderer. Eventually, he have been pushed too far, and he transforms himself into the Joker who begins to take revenge on the world. 
	Phoenix is really into his character's insanity and it causes the viewer to be anxious in many different ways, because Arthur is often such a scary person. At the same time it is strangely funny that viewer also understands and even feels sorry for him for some reason. Arthur has been mistreated by the world all of his life and as a viewer might be startled when totally realizes why he becomes the Clown Prince of Gotham. A fantastic addition to this movie is the illness that Arthur's have, which makes him laugh recklessly, even though he doesn't want to. Phoenix may instantly start to howl when he laughs and also all the smile might suddenly just disappear off his face. He is scary but at the same time really sympathetic. The farther the movie goes, the bigger Phoenix gets to tear up and enjoy his role.

The movie is a realistic story about a man who is plunged into deep darkness, mental illness and for everything what these kinds of problems might cause. Although the Joker is often perceived as a smiling and hilarious character, he can not really be called hilarious in his own movie. This is a truly distressing and heartbreaking piece with a slight sense of humor. The movie mercilessly takes its viewer inside Arthur's mind, which is plagued by many things. The character's journey from a boy who takes care of his mother to an iconic criminal is an extremely captivating in all its horror. The film is oddly fascinating and Arthur's sudden dances might go into hypnotism even though they are very confusing and weird. This is one of the best cartoon animations of all time perhaps because it never feels like it and overall, it is an incredibly great movie."
"Feb 29, 2020",POSITIVE,AMAZING!! Phoenix is phenomenal which makes up for the lack of supporting cast members. The score and cinematography are excellent. There is one quite violent scene but I think it worked well with the tone of the film. Ending is amazing and left me talking about it for days. It’s a must see!!
"Feb 29, 2020",NEUTRAL,For 2 hours I expected more substance. Instead it opted to use that time trying to create artsy shots
"Feb 29, 2020",POSITIVE,Amazing all way around on story we all know and love.
"Feb 29, 2020",POSITIVE,Amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix. With an interesting story.
"Feb 28, 2020",POSITIVE,it is the best movie i have and ever will see. if you havent seen it you must right away as it is a masterpice and miles ahead of any other movie
"Feb 28, 2020",POSITIVE,The best movie for humanity to be one
"Feb 28, 2020",POSITIVE,"Incredible! Joker is really good! I didn't expect it, but with Todd Phillips directing and Joaquin Phoenix's acting combined it's amazing. The third act was really intense. It's a brutal sad movie probably not for everyone. Overall one of my favorite comic book movies of all time. One issue I have is that it feels like its copied movies like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. So it takes those movies and feels less original. 9.5/10"
"Feb 28, 2020",POSITIVE,Excellent acting. Loved it when the joker shot those three bullies dead . 
"Feb 28, 2020",POSITIVE,Should have 100 best movie
"Feb 28, 2020",POSITIVE,Surprisingly accurate portrayal of mental health trauma. Would make an outstanding starting point for a new DCU
"Feb 28, 2020",POSITIVE,Loved it! Psych thriller. Real! Gritty. Surprise ending. Will leave you pondering for days. 
"Feb 28, 2020",NEGATIVE,This movie is not only horrible but socially irresponsible.  You may have given psychopaths everywhere impetus to murder because life isn't fair.
"Feb 27, 2020",POSITIVE,"I watched this purely to see Phoenix's performance and he was outstanding.  The story was very absorbing and a lot of sympathy for Joker, with an ending that should come as no surprise to anyone in power"
"Feb 27, 2020",POSITIVE,Made me a fan. Love the messages.
"Feb 10, 2020",POSITIVE,"What i expected: a decent into madness.
What i experienced: an accent into a position of power.
I cringed throughout the film. It took a few days for me to decide whether i actually enjoyed the movie. I think that as it has kept me thinking about it, and seeking the opinions of others, it is definitely a ‘must see' and i look forward to watching it again, but it was certainly not an easy-going fun film."
"Feb 10, 2020",POSITIVE,"In these coddled times we live in, it becomes increasingly important to dive into the deep end of depravity and take a look at how dark things can go if left to their own demise. The acting is phenomenal, the plot thick, and I truly felt for the characters for a good week after viewing it. I appreciate and sign off on the Batman lore presented, and will be purchasing this movie when it comes out for my collection."
"Feb 10, 2020",NEGATIVE,"While I have to have respect for Joaquin Phoenix’s performance, the story itself is a dark narrative that offers no redeeming qualities. With a good dose of sudden and unrestrained violence the viewer is left with unnecessary images to live with, i.e. things one wishes they could unsee. Additionally the story leverages child abuse and mental illness as foundations for its trajectory. "
"Feb 10, 2020",POSITIVE,"While most may be thinking this is some sort of prequel to a caped crusader series, it is not.  Joaquin Phoenix Delivers the best Acting performance I have seen in YEARS, and Joker is a new story that takes you down a dark psychopaths life view.  My all time favorite movie."
"Feb 10, 2020",POSITIVE,This movie is outstanding. Some people won't understand it because they don't know what mental illness feels like. It is very raw and it will make you uncomfortable. Go see it.
"Feb 10, 2020",POSITIVE,Best Joker movie.. Joaquin Phoenix character and acting was excellent. A different intimate side of the Joker with a great plot and twisted ending!
"Feb 10, 2020",POSITIVE,It's breathtaking in entering your mind and playing with your conscience while having an encounter with the present world's evils.
"Feb 10, 2020",NEUTRAL,"Im quite torn between a 5 star performance from Phoenix and a 2 star script from Phillips. While the movie gives a fantastic character study lead by Phoenix, the stylistic decisions are at many time boring and always expected and what Phillips is ""trying to say"" is at best muddled and at worst aimlessly jumping from one shallowly touched on social observation to the next."
"Feb 10, 2020",POSITIVE,Such a well written and put together film. Phoenix was the best Joker ever in my opinion. The emotion and plot twists had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
"Feb 10, 2020",POSITIVE,Scary but entertaining
"Feb 10, 2020",NEUTRAL,"A dark and incredibly bleak look into the mind of a sick and tormented soul. 
This film would most likely have been a critical bomb if not for the incredible and gripping performance of Joaquin Phoenix, who rightly deserves an Oscar for best Actor. 
   The movie is worth seeing if just to witness Joaquin's deeply unsettling vision and interpretation of the Joker character."
"Feb 10, 2020",POSITIVE,"When i found out that Todd Phillips was making a movie based on Joker, i immediately wanted to kill all the hype for the movie, this movie is coming from a guy that did dark comedies, and i really wanted to skip it, but god was i wrong. Todd Phillips wrote a beautiful script for the movie that's not attached or adapted from any comic, and this is an entire new origin story for the Joker character. Joaquin Phoenix delivers an Oscar worthy performance. This movie pays respect to Heath Ledger's Joker. Overall, JOKER was a great movie, and one of the best Comic Book Movies ever made."
"Feb 10, 2020",NEGATIVE,"Good movie, but it in no way felt like an actual Joker movie. Joker in name only. It was Falling Down with a DC license. "
"Feb 10, 2020",NEGATIVE,Some needless gross violence
"Feb 10, 2020",POSITIVE,Great movie and best in 2019 😁
"Feb 10, 2020",POSITIVE,"This is one of the most incredible pieces of cinema that has graced the screen in years. This is a proper arthouse film that blends craftsmanship with source material. While it is supposedly a one-shot take on the Clown Prince of Crime, it does not ignore the source material to the extent that it is a whole new character, i.e. Will Smith as Deadshot -- Will Smith playing anyone is still Will Smith playing Will Smith playing [said character].

JOKER finds a balance between the creative ideas for the character and the character's long-winded history. This is a film worth seeing, if not for the empowerment of low-budget cinema, for the way Joaquin Phoenix inhabits his space. He becomes the character in simple ways, embracing everything about the broken man society forgot."
"Feb 10, 2020",POSITIVE,"Exploring the origin of Joker but it has nothing like in a comic. The film introduces us to a poor guy that has been suffering from his mental illness and is likely to grow worse as time pass, I had prepared that a film will not involve any action scene as we thought that Joker would somehow interact with the famous character like Batman. It is different, It's a stand-alone movie."
"Feb 10, 2020",POSITIVE,"Not your typical Super Hero/Villain movie. Dives down deep into Aurther/Joker's mind, explaining his every move. Must see!"
"Feb 10, 2020",POSITIVE,Very entertaining movie...and i LOVE Joaquin Pheonix's acting...and the cinematography is just absolutely amazing!
"Feb 10, 2020",NEUTRAL,One of the darkest films I’ve seen in quite sometime. Amazing performance by Phoenix of a very disturbed and complicated character. 
"Jan 17, 2020",NEUTRAL,"Let's start by saying that I did enjoy the movie.  It's a good film, entertaining.  But the hype made me expect more and that just wasn't there.  I'm not in agreement with Dan Kois at Slate who dismisses the movie as ""stupid"".  There are moments that stretch the line of credulity, but no more so than any other superhero film.  My complaints about the movie center on two main things; plot development and character veracity.  
As to plot, the movie creates a sense of impending doom without ever delivering on the doom.  Knowing that the character would eventually become the mass-murdering ""Clown Prince of Crime"" is supposed to infuse all of the main character's actions with import.  What the movie doesn't do is build to an inevitable crescendo that resolves itself in tragedy.  In this way the movie is less horrific than it ought to be.  Horror is best when the end product is the result of one action or choice after another - building to an inevitable conclusion.  But in ""Joker"" there is no inevitability, no lie the character believes, no inciting moment, no complication and development, no buildup of tension leading to an inevitable peak.  Act I is the same as Act II which is the same as Act III in this movie b/c there really is no progress, or attempt to avoid the inevitable, or gradual discovery of the awfulness, or repetition of symbolic metaphors.  There is one big mother of a temper tantrum on live tv which results in some redecorating of the walls of the set but there is no real climax to the story.  In terms of plot, therefore, it's more like watching snow fall off a roof or watching paint dry or watching a pancake slide down a wall; you know it will and when it does... meh.  
In terms of character I have two main disagreements.  
First is an implausibility to the Arthur Fleck character - the guy is a total sad sack whose eventual ""transformation"" into the Joker is more like one more sucky thing happening to him than it is a moment of horrific inevitability.  It is hard to accept that one person would have so many bad things happen to him; abusive adoptive mother, crappy apartment, loser talents, dead end job, miserable gritty town, hostile and antagonistic neighbors, lousy boss, health issues, bad looks - yeah, your life sucks, dude.  But oddly, even when people seem to have lousy lives they still have humor, friends, moments of joy, insight, access to art or poetry or song or booze - which make life bearable.  Why didn't Fleck have any of this?  Alright, so he's a loser with the ladies, but couldn't he have made a pass at that cute social worker, or maybe struck up a conversation with the gal on the subway after he killed those three dudes?  or learned to play the guitar on the street like John Lee Hooker?  or get drunk at the local with other losers?  Something!  Anything!  It's as though the writers didn't know what normal humans actually do with their run-down lives.  Normal humans eat junk food and get diabetes; binge watch ""Game of Thrones"" on Netflix; play pool or checkers or Pacman at the local arcade - Something!  Anything! besides washing their Grendelian mother every night.  The character just seems unbelievable.  Indeed, against a hostile world human beings have a startling resilience which takes the most amazing forms; learning to polka dance at the Czech club - collecting spores, molds and fungus - becoming the leading expert on ""Doc Savage"" comics.  Something!  Anything!  Resistance is not futile!  

Second, Aristotle had it right when he said that horror or tragedy in a character is always strongest when it is the result of the character's own choices & actions.  To choose evil, or even to choose without understanding and thus make a fatal mistake leading to inevitable ruin, is more horrible than simply being the patsy for a violent world.  In ""Joker"" the maniac is created by a hostile world abusing a poor demented victim.  Arthur Fleck even says this when talking to Murray Franklin (DeNiro)
What do you get...when you cross...a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash?  You get what you ******' deserve!
This is too simplistic an equation, I think.  It is as if to say that ""society"" is to blame – rather than individuals who are evil or good.  Fleck is just ""mad as hell and not going to take it anymore!"" More to the point is that in terms of art the character is not so horrific because he never CHOOSES to be a monster.  The truly horrific human monsters in literature and in life such as Grendel, Macbeth, Patrick Bateman, Niander Wallace, or John Gacey, Jeffrey Dahmer, Pol Pot, Che Guevara – all choose the role of monster.  Perhaps they justify their actions or perhaps they had horrible things done to them, but their choice remained their own.  The Swansea conference, or the treatments of the kulaks by Stalin, or the flaying of young coeds, or Idi Amin's cannibalistic devouring of his enemies, abuse, child-molestation, random school shootings, slát unwearnum / bát bánlocan / blód édrum dranc / synsnaédum swealh – these are the horrific monsters of human society and all are the result of choice, not mere accident.  As an audience we do not find horror only in the violence they perpetrate but in the CHOICE to commit such violence.  Our horror stems from the knowledge that perhaps we too might make a similar choice.  It would not be so pungent were these events mere accidents of nature, or if they were perpetrated by some unthinking beast.  It is, rather, the willed malice that causes horror to rise in us like some cold Lovecraftian behemoth.  
But Fleck's simpering victimhood doesn't inspire such horror.  He is a pitiable character with his expressions of ""I just hope my death make more cents than my life"" (poor blighter can't even spell right) and his Hitchcockian mother complex (""She always tells me to smile, and put on a happy face"" = pathetic) but he is a victim – a sad skinny puppy cowering in the rain.  Even his name is little more than a fleck even though he is supposed to be Arthurian in his greatness.  When he kills his victims there is even an invitation to rejoice as each one is a bully, a jerk, an abuser deserving of some justice.  In the final murder of Murray Franklin (in an obvious homage to the Frank Miller scene) I had to stifle a little cheer as it seemed so appropriate.  More horror exists in seeing Oedipus come out on stage with his bleeding eyeballs, or watching Sweeney Todd (Len Cariou) suddenly discover who the beggar woman is whom he has just murdered, or watching Bull McCabe (Richard Harris) drive his son over the cliff with the cattle. When Fleck has his final apotheosis on the police car amidst cheering crowds of clown-masked adorers there is little to cheer or be horrified by – it's just… meh.  
In conclusion, I would recommend this movie.  It is a worthy addition to the Batman lore.  Certainly Joaquin Phoenix gives a performance which, though never building in intensity, definitely is deserving of consideration.  The music and camera work are both quite good and there is something of merit in seeing what the movie has to say.  But overall, were I to choose it again, I might enjoy watching pancakes slide down the wall instead."
"Jan 17, 2020",POSITIVE,"Joaquin Phoenix is perfect in this movie! I loved the psychological turn of this Joker, the complexity and profoundness of the character is amazing. The soundtrack gave me goosebumps and even visually is a very stunning movie!"
"Jan 17, 2020",NEUTRAL,its good as like Joke as joker hahahaha
"Jan 17, 2020",NEUTRAL,"A fotografia é espetacular, o ator impecável e o jeito que tudo se encaixa é incrível. Entretanto novamente o público deixou o filme muito falado e quando vai ver não é tudo isso."
"Jan 17, 2020",POSITIVE,"Better than I expected. Not oscar worthy, but better than I imagined."
"Jan 17, 2020",POSITIVE,"Absolutely brilliant performances, directing, and set design.  Having grown up in the 80's in NY the set and feel were spot on from the general feeling that NYC was in an unescapable decay to the elevators, hospitals, apartments, and subways - like I was there again.  Well almost, NYC was actually far worse but A+ for effort. As far as Joaquin Phoenix, just spectacular.  Easily the best performance of the year."
"Jan 17, 2020",NEGATIVE,Too much ideology too little work! this is just phoenix solely working hard with lots of B-roll and GFX. there is no movie here and phoenix's efforts look ridiculous when put in such a shallow context!
"Jan 17, 2020",POSITIVE,The jocker movie goes up and beyond in many aspects with the soundtrack able to switch to a sad and scary theme than to a loud and classical theme with great performances and being one of the first movies to actually get shocked and fearful towards Arthur fleck. With some downsides being that it copies other movies beat for beat like the king of comedy is a big comparison other than that a good movie.
"Jan 17, 2020",NEUTRAL,"I think the best Joker is the Killing Joke (comic) version, however this is a good adaptation and modernization of the Joker. One of fundamental problems I have with this film is that they are making the Joker more of an anti-hero instead of a full villain. Yeah it's important to be have a human background, but I want to see himself killing innocent people not just people who offended Joker feelings. The best Joker comes from the Killing Joke knows that life is a joke, and that anyone who goes through that ""1 bad day"" will become crazy like the Joker and the Batman... and that life is completely pointless... so it doesn't matter who dies or not, because all life is a joke to him. I think Batman part of the story was really weak, which is also a disappointment because Joker in a weird love relationship with the Batman in this books, so it's disappoint they Batman didn't push the ""Joker"" in the acid pit, and that Joker isn't obsessive with the Batman.... 

I hope if they do a sequel to this Joker movie, they had all the above element stories to the Joker, and they lose the ""anti-hero"" touch or else they screw up the character like they did to our beloved Vemon in the comic books. Where Vemon was a full on villain, and slowly though the years, they turned him into a ""greyish type of hero""...sometimes doing the bad thing, but usually working with regular superheroes like ""it no problem"". Carnage was actually made because of Vemon changing into a hero, and Carnage was also based on the old version Vemon and Joker."
"Jan 17, 2020",NEGATIVE,"Should have been called, “Not the Joker.” Great acting by the main character but then, he’s often the same deranged, misanthrope in his movies. Stick with the comic book formula. It works. Go changing things up for “artistic license?” Sure, you’ll get awards but this isn’t The Joker."
"Jan 17, 2020",POSITIVE,We live in a Society
"Jan 17, 2020",POSITIVE,"SPOILER WARNING!
Pros: I like how the villain is the protagonist and instead of hating him you feel bad for him. You feel bad for Joker right away when he is just holding up a sign and gets jumped and the sign was destroyed. You feel even more bad for him when he gets fired by his boss because he gets blamed for breaking a sign. So Randal buys a gun but this gun is very important to the movie and I like it. The thing I like even more about this movie is that you see Joker as a good guy at the start of the movie but by the end of it he is a villain. So he has a dream where he is on a tv show and he is on Murray's tv show. So in a bar Arthur makes some jokes that nobody laughs at so later in the movie Murray makes fun of him. So he meets a girl but so you thought he met this girl because this girl was all in his head. So when Arthur(Joker) gets a second job as a clown for a children's hospital he brings a gun but it falls out f his coat so he gets fired and you continue to feel bad for him. So when he is on the bus he is laughing because of a condition he has that makes him laugh randomly and he does. So the three guys on the bus make fun of him and start to beat him up the same way those kids beat him at the start of the movie. So he shoots his gun and kills one of them but instead of making him unlikable you feel bad for him and root for him.  So you want Arthur to kill those three guys and he does and it is used eventually to start a movement. Eventually, Thomas Wayne is crying about their deaths on tv. The movie picks up when you realize the girlfriend was all in his imagination and his dad could be Thomas Wayne. I like the scene where Arthur visits the Wayne mansion and talk to Bruce Wayne. I also really like the part where Thomas Wayne and Arthur are in the bathroom and Thomas Wayne is mad because Joker touch Bruce's cheeks so he punches Arthur and you feel bad for him. When you figure out all the lies Arthur's mom told him that's when you feel really bad for him because his mother said that the condition that makes him laugh is made up. So Arthur kills his mom but you still don't hate him. After he puts on makeup and gets a costume and becomes Joker and that is when I got really excited. When David and Randal go to Arthur's house to check on him he killed Randal. So, later on, He dances down a staircase and you like it and can get into his vibe. So he is getting chased by cops but he gets a mask. So he eventually meets Murray and he gets to be on a tv show but he wants to be introduced as Joker. When he is on tv it is incredible. I won't go into too much detail but he makes some good pointers on how he thinks society is wrong and in a way you can see where he is coming from and in a way you can see how his actions are wrong. So he kills Murray and gets arrested but his movement has start and one of the people inspired by this movement kills Thomas and Martha Wayne. So Joker gets arrested and has me thinking that there could be a sequel and I really hope they make a sequel. The great thing about this movie is that the more you think about it the better it gets and the more you like it.

Cons: The movie is very similar to Taxi Driver and you could make this exact movie about a different character and it would still feel the same because this movie doesn't really feel like a Joker movie.

Overall I am really happy that Joaquin Pheonix won an Oscar from this movie and I think he 100% deserves it. I'm gonna give Joker an (A)"
"Jan 17, 2020",POSITIVE,"Watched The Joker last night and what a crazy trippy ride it was, to be expected of course! Joaquin Phoenix is ""The Joker"" I'm convinced! He played the role so perfectly it's as if I didn't even see Joaquin Phoenix, I saw the Joker! It took me so long to fall asleep after watching, it was brutal and heart wrenching but at the same time I couldn't get over the cinematography and how this tragic film could be made so beautifully! Every scene was a piece of art, carefully framed to perfection which was contrast to Jokers erratic behavior but so well balanced, the lighting, placement, positioning, timing etc, the music fit the emotions I felt throughout. I haven't seen a film I could barely watch yet love at the same time for it's all around brilliance! I feel messed up, touched and inspired all at once!"
"Jan 17, 2020",POSITIVE,Best since Heath ledger 😊
"Jan 16, 2020",POSITIVE,"Phillps, Silver, and Phoenix have crafted a disturbing look at a disturbed individual. Superbly done."
"Jan 16, 2020",POSITIVE,Absolutely class mate. Best film i've seen in years
"Jan 16, 2020",NEGATIVE,I dont know whats the hype about but its Not my juice. Pass.
"Jan 16, 2020",POSITIVE,"Good movie loved it, loved the acting and direction"
"Jan 16, 2020",POSITIVE,"Dunno what the critics are thinking !! This movie is an absolute masterpiece, the acting and everything are just incredible. When I first saw the critics reviews, I thought the movie would be bad but it turned out to be A great movie. From now on, I'm gonna depend on user reviews only cause I don't know what critics are thinking these days."
"Jan 16, 2020",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing performance by Phoenix. 

 If you're from great neighborhood, finished private school and never had to see the darker parts of humanity, this movie most probably will not touch you at all. Sorry."
"Jan 12, 2020",POSITIVE,I thought that the movie was great and gives a good story about a troubled man who slowly looses it.
"Jan 12, 2020",NEGATIVE,"I'm a big fan of Superhero movies but I really feel like DC misses the boat sometimes.  I understand that many love it, I just feel like it fell flat."
"Jan 12, 2020",NEGATIVE,Such a dark and gloomy story and another superhero gendre movie to take over the file industry. Not sure if Oscar should reward it too generously.
"Jan 12, 2020",NEGATIVE,Nothing good about this movie. It’s crap. 
"Jan 12, 2020",POSITIVE,Phenomenal. Masterpiece. Perfection.
"Jan 12, 2020",NEGATIVE,Pointless shaggy dog story ... no connection to Batman story
"Jan 12, 2020",POSITIVE,Best performance of joker yet. 
"Jan 12, 2020",POSITIVE,It made me feel sick the entire time. A thing I didn't even know I wanted. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is one of the best performances I've seen in any movie.
"Jan 12, 2020",POSITIVE,"Can be difficult to watch at times, and plays out like a tragedy but WOW - what an amazing movie and performance by Phoenix. Not recommended for a date night, but a superb character study on societal isolation and mental illness. "
"Jan 12, 2020",POSITIVE,"A masterpiece on so many levels.
One of the best movies I have seen in years.
Directed brilliantly, acted phenomenally, shot excellently. I don't understand how people can give this movie negative reviews.
It is a triumphant of cinematography!!!! 
The music, the story telling, the beautifully upsetting directoral shot, everything about the joker is perfect!!! 
This is tremendous movie on sooo many levels. 
I have no words to describe the excellent story telling and superbness of this film!!"
"Jan 12, 2020",NEGATIVE,super disappointed after all the hype. The acting was good I just expected a different story. it shows his decline into the maddness
"Jan 12, 2020",NEGATIVE,Extremely slow and boring. Hard to want to keep watching after the first hour. Builds up to about two minutes worth of watchable tv. Phoenix has decent parts but the script was weak and too drawn out. No action
"Jan 12, 2020",POSITIVE,This should win best actor and best film. If it doesn't then its just Hollywood being against the film for personal reasons and not BC of the final product.
"Jan 12, 2020",NEGATIVE,Anti-climatic and predictable.
"Jan 12, 2020",NEGATIVE,i dont see what all the fuss is about
"Jan 12, 2020",POSITIVE,Great story for an iconic character
"Jan 11, 2020",POSITIVE,"I'll admit, this was a boring 6/10 or so on my first viewing. But a lot of people suggested watching it again, and it's a solid 9.8/10. Where do I begin? The acting and characters were phenomenal, the writing is airtight, and it tells a believable and compelling story about a man's descent into madness, with messages and themes about how we need to care about and look after people who are mentally ill or disadvantaged. The shots and cinematography are great, the music score and its use are great. A lot of people are complaining that it makes them feel uncomfortable, but that's kind of the point - it's a look into a disturbing life of a man with a mental illness."
"Jan 11, 2020",NEGATIVE,"Todd Phillips directed this box office hit, based on Bob Kane's DC comics character, creating an origin story around Batman's arch nemesis. Set in early 1980s Gotham, overrun by crime where the streets are littered with garbage, a street clown, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), fantasizes about being a stand-up comedian and appearing on television with his favorite talk show host (Robert De Niro). When his dreams fail, he experiences hallucinations which leads to an outbreak of violence that inspires a countercultural revolution against the wealthy Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) in Gotham. This is essentially a Batman movie as if conceived by Scorsese but without the psychological depth or social commentary. Casting De Niro in the movie only makes the comparisons to ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The King of Comedy"" even more obvious.  What's most disturbing is that the movie projects an overall feeling of nihilism. Joaquin Phoenix shows, once again, why he is one of the most original and daring of American actors. He takes on one of the most iconic roles and gives it new dimensions. His uncontrollable fits of laughter are indelible. Won Oscars for Best Actor (Joaquin Phoenix) and Original Score. Written by Todd Phillips and Scott Silver. Cinematography is by Lawrence Sher. Music is by Hildur Guonadottir. With Zazie Beetz, Frances Conroy, Shea Whigham, and Bill Camp."
"Jan 11, 2020",NEGATIVE,"disturbing, overdone, vague, a torture session to watch. couldn't wait for it to be over. Phoenix is mesmerizing at points, but you have to suffer through a lot of overdone drama,  cackling laughing, and the ridiculous notion that everyone punches this guy in the face,  to appreciate it...hated it."
"Jan 11, 2020",POSITIVE,"The movie was dark and gritty. Joaquin Phoenix played an excellent Joker, one of the best renditions of Joker in any movie and I would love to see a second movie that would tie in with Heath Ledger's portrayal. I give it a 5 out of 5 stars."
"Dec 21, 2019",NEGATIVE,"Watch Taxi Driver, King of Comedy, and Network for the same effect"
"Dec 21, 2019",POSITIVE,It's an extremely disturbing look at a mentally insane person lose what little they have.
"Dec 21, 2019",POSITIVE,A brilliant movie in every way conceivable and imaginable... Great to watch and leaves an even greater aftertaste; much food for thought...
"Dec 21, 2019",POSITIVE,"A wonderful performance from Joaquin, which left me feeling empathy for the joker, despite the terrible things he did."
"Dec 21, 2019",POSITIVE,"Arthur's lack of validation by any other human drives him into a corner where he begins making violent decisions without remorse. Very depressing, nihilistic and quite dark. The atmosphere and music becomes unbearable in a beautiful way. There is very little release of tension throughout the movie, which provoked me to feel relief when violence finally occurs. 

The story is much more focused on classism and inequality than I initially expected due to it mostly being discussed as a representation of mental illness. In my opinion, it manages to simultaneously be both a passable and also hugely inaccurate representation of mental illness. By that I mean Arthur's symptoms of anxiety and his dysfunctional coping mechanisms were somewhat realistic (particularly his shaking, as well as the odd and intrusive nature of his daydreams, which took the form of supportive and loving figures for self-validation). However, his violence is not really due to mental illness or delusion. Rather, it is as a result of his philosophical choices and worldview. 

It left me feeling awful. Because it left me feeling, and I felt its impact ringing in my head for the following days, I rate it highly. Relatively validating, not encouraging. Don't watch when you're feeling down, unless you're okay with feeling worse afterwards."
"Dec 21, 2019",POSITIVE,The best comic book adaption of all time. Better than V for Vendetta.
"Dec 21, 2019",POSITIVE,"Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic in his role as the iconic character. Possibly a career best for
Phoenix. The amount of talent behind the crafting in this movie truly elevates this movie above the rest of the DC movies. Time will tell if this movie still remains relevant in the years to come."
"Dec 21, 2019",POSITIVE,Dark psychological comedy about a lunatic with a gun. Great soundtrack and cinematography. Gives some different style that makes the Batman franchise deeper.
"Dec 21, 2019",POSITIVE,So different.  Exceptional.
"Dec 21, 2019",NEUTRAL,It's a good history with a great performance. And that's it. No more than that
"Dec 21, 2019",POSITIVE,"Reminiscent of a Scorsese film, this psychological thriller does not feel at all like a comic book movie. Many say that Joaquin Phoenix topped Heath Ledgers' Joker. I would not agree because Joaquin Phoenix does something arguably even harder to pull off- he does a great pre-joker; A great Joker back story. The film is more about a potential origin story for the joker and that is something that would be very hard to do right because the joker is already immortalized as the perfect villain. Creating an origin story could ruin the magic and marvel to the joker, but this film adds to it. Instead of merely explaining where the joker came from, like every other comic book superhero movie has done, this film is only giving you a possible idea of what might have happened. It is absolutely true to the essence of the modern joker, and his performance is intimidating, and in the best of ways. Exactly the temperance you'd expect from the Joker in his youth were you to encounter him on the street. There is also some profound commentary on the state of American society that I did not expect from this film, and it made it go above and beyond. The cinematography and side characters are also appropriately grim and dismally comical. I understand why people wouldn't like it because I understand why people don't like the Joker character or these kind of challenging movies, but I say its a masterpiece and a must-see."
"Dec 21, 2019",POSITIVE,o my god it's awesome!
"Dec 21, 2019",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies ever made, up there with the greatest of all time.
Never seen a better performance from a actor. Just has to win a oscar or two for this, Joaquin phenix, his brother was pretty talented too... just WHAT a movie this is, a must watch for anyone my god this is what you call a movie, and why they are made."
"Dec 21, 2019",POSITIVE,absolutely on my top ten
"Dec 21, 2019",NEGATIVE,Very repetitive and forceful. I felt the film was trying too hard to make me feel empathetic/sympathetic. Decent ending though and Phoenix does a good job.
"Dec 21, 2019",POSITIVE,"i really loved it! the music, the color in the scenes and the best of all the performance of the main character!"
"Dec 21, 2019",POSITIVE,"One of those movies you can't just get it out of your head. It has its flaws yes, but it was overall great movie."
"Dec 21, 2019",POSITIVE,"A bit uneven which is probably why you see a wide range of reviews.

The first 45 minutes or so are almost kind of boring but then it kicks into high gear and pays off the setup of the first hour.

Phoenix is great both as Arthur, and Joker. I had some issues with his Joker though. Not how he portrayed him, like I said he was great, but there are some personality traits he embraces as the Joker that he showed no hint of as Arthur. It's like he became an entirely different character for the last party of the movie. That character was great, but it wasn't consistent with what had led up to it.


For me personally, I still prefer Heath Ledger's Joker, though Phoenix's might be a close second. Like Ledger's, you find yourself at times wondering if that's the same actor behind the paint. I just prefer Ledger's ""Agent of Chaos"" Joker to Phoenix's portrayal which I can't even give a good definition to yet. ""Insanely Sane""?

Phoenix will definitely be nominated for the role."
"Dec 21, 2019",NEUTRAL,You will hate the wayns :D
"Dec 21, 2019",POSITIVE,How a movie should be made. Dark gritty old search material with a new convincing reimagine story.
"Dec 18, 2019",NEGATIVE,Poor story line. Felt dragged out with suspense up to a huge ending that never happens. 
"Dec 18, 2019",POSITIVE,"True Cinema. Suspenseful. Heartbreaking. Brilliant. Unforgettable. Cinematography is on point. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is breathtaking. Raises important and uncomfortable questions about our society, probably the reason why so many people aren't able to admit this is a great film."
"Dec 18, 2019",POSITIVE,"es una película que nos muestra la mentalidad de un hombre decayendo lentamente en la locura debido a el estado actual de una ciudad dolorosamente real el cambio de mentalidad de Arthur Fleck de una persona tolerante a un asesino y líder de una pandilla de delincuentes conformadas por una ciudad cansada de la opresión y el mal trato de una política corrompida nos demuestra que un mal día en la vida de un hombre puede causar un coas

Con grandes actuaciones como la de Joaquin Phoenix, una banda sonora asombrosa y una historia que no deja con mas preguntas que respuestas la considero una gran película merecedora de varios reconocimientos."
"Dec 18, 2019",POSITIVE,The best movie of 2019
"Dec 18, 2019",NEGATIVE,"This movie has pretty much no need to exist. It adds nothing to the character and doesn't really feel like it suits the character. The whole ""Joker"" name doesn't need to be on this film as it barely cares about the source material. This film didn't even feel the need to explain where the name ""Joker"" comes from. Phoenix's performance is the only memorable thing."
"Dec 18, 2019",POSITIVE,A másterpiece of this decade!
"Dec 18, 2019",POSITIVE,"For a while watching this it was hard to place because it did not have the feel of Gotham City. I wasn't a fan either of the way the film ended with more questions than anticipation (that is the best I can describe without spoiling). However, Joaquin Phoenix alone makes up for a lot of the pieces that I felt were missing. He was marvelous."
"Dec 18, 2019",POSITIVE,The newest joker invests in a totally thought-provoking drama that holds you to the end with the unpredictable ending ... Great movie 10/10
"Dec 18, 2019",POSITIVE,"Great movie! I loved it all the way through. Amazing acting, story, directing, and put together very well. It’s a little bit of a slow start but it’s nothing to make you want to turn it off but keeping you wanting more."
"Dec 18, 2019",NEGATIVE,Joker has never more lived in a society than he does in Joker.
"Dec 18, 2019",NEGATIVE,"yeah, for me it really was unimpressive. It's like you could see them to win an award by being ""edgy."" It fell short of all the acclaim and praise I've been hearing. It oversimplifies mental health in my opinion."
"Dec 18, 2019",POSITIVE,"A brilliant and new portrayal of one of the most iconic comic book villains of all time!
Once again, critics lied to you. Or they were at least dis-honest about why they disliked the film. It's a real shame they do not see how irresponsible they are by bashing a movie based solely on 'perceived' political messages. 
If Joker has any political messages, it's a very liberal one. Which make's me wonder why the major media outlets all stood against it?
I have a feeling, it has to do with the movie theater shooting a few years back when the Dark Knight was released. Maybe that's it. Who knows. All I know is this was one of the best films of the year hands down. And Phoneix deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance."
"Dec 18, 2019",POSITIVE,"Well written, well told storyline . Leaves you wanting more."
"Dec 18, 2019",POSITIVE,"La pelicula es muy buena, el ambiente, el vestuario, efectos,... sobre todo habla de la transformacion del personaje y en ningun momentos hablan de batman solo se centra en joker ..."
"Dec 18, 2019",POSITIVE,Buen cine en toda la extensión de la frase
"Dec 18, 2019",POSITIVE,May be the best movie if the year!! Definitely best performance of the year!!
"Dec 18, 2019",NEGATIVE,"This movie would not have been able to stand on its own if the Joker wasn't already infamous due to DC Comics. There wasn't much of a plot. The only interesting parts were the very depressing parts. The ""tortured, bullied"" backstory of Arthur Fleck seems worth telling in the form of a movie, but I think it could have been done much better."
"Dec 18, 2019",POSITIVE,"OMG , i never though someone will beat Heath Ledger , this was way beyond what I imagined "
"Dec 18, 2019",NEUTRAL,Nice to seen Joaquin Phoenix loosing himself a little bit. Excellent part for a thrilled character
"Dec 18, 2019",POSITIVE,This movie better win a oscar
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,I grew up watching Batman as a child and to see the story of the Joker told through Phillips eyes was cool. Joaquin was AWESOME!
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,Outstanding movie and protagonist
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,I love how they made it uncomfortable to watch even. the movie really pulls you in. musical score was great in characterizing his emotions.
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,stop adding more criticism to joker is enough please no more bad critics
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,"Dark, but good. The mental illness aspect made it work."
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix was amazing as Joker. This is what a DC movie should look like.
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix was amazing!
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,"Loved the how, and why the joker became... A must see for those that are real fans of Super Heros and their Villains...."
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,flippin amazing showing of a masterpiece
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,Great tie into Batman and now we know why the Joker does what he does. The ending in the hospital was odd. Not sure why it ended that way - maybe a sequel will reveal why.JM
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,"best solo acting performance of our generation. 

Give the man a Oscar and do it justice. 

10/10 love it love it"
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,"I have learned to ignore the so called experts and go straight to the fans on a rating. This movie was amazing . Dark , sad image of mental illness. Phoenix is a talented actor"
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,Gradual arch of character development increasing to eventual all out insanity and rage!!!!  A masterpiece!!!
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,Loved the whole movie. Loved how they laid daown Joker's foundation.
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,Loved hard dark and cynical it was
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,"Joaquins Joker is the most sensational role of his career & the most real Joker weve ever seen. 
Direction is excellent."
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,Phoenix is spectacular and Todd Philips is triumphant
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,Excellent job in acting!!
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely brilliant!
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,"An amazing film by Todd Phillips with a brilliant performance from Joaquin Phoenix.  This version of Gotham is the most realistic I've ever seen and it gives all of the events a real punch that would otherwise be lacking in a standard comic book screen adaptation.  Anyone who says this film glorifies violence obviously hasn't actually watched it.  Either that or they have a political agenda forcing them to trash the film.  Now, don't get me wrong; the movie is NOT flawless.  There are a few rough edges with some of the supporting characters and the ending feels somewhat rushed compared to the slow burn of the first hour.  But the actors' performances more than made up for those minor quibbles and I highly recommend this film as one of the best comic book adaptations ever made.  This is what Black Panther aspired to be despite it actually turning out to be nothing but a bog-standard superhero film clone of Iron Man, Ant-Man, etc.  All of the unearned attention and plaudits awarded to Black Panther should have gone to Joker instead."
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,"Good movie, let’s you get in the mind of a mentally disturb person, and what sent him over the edge."
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,dark and disturbing twist. Joaquin Phoenix is a genius
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,The acting was phenomenal and the story was told extremely well. This movie is not for the faint at heart. but coincides with the mental health concerns we face in today's society.
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,So dark and psychological. It was long af but held my attention the entire time. I've never seen another joker that could hold up against Heath Ledger but Joaquin was phenomenal!!!!
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,It starts a little slow and makes you wonder what is happening... but once things start happening just get ready for the ride of your life in discovering just who the Joker is. Movie is amazing.
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,The movie was a masterpiece telling of a complete breakdown of a person with mental illness. Absolutely fascinating to watch.
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,"Great portrait of a descent into madness, and maybe the reason why Batman never ended him, despite all the destruction"
"Nov 9, 2019",NEGATIVE,The movie was longer than necessary and did not keep my interest. It was difficult to follow at times. I would not recommend it.
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,Great Movie all the way around! Acting was perfect and I was very much into the characters.
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,puts a spotlight on whats wrong with how we treat the people who desperately need help
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,INCREDIBLY MAGNIFICENT HEARTBREAKING AND POWERFUL
"Nov 9, 2019",NEGATIVE,"Great acting from Joaquin Phoenix! However, the movie was very slow. Kept checking my watch."
"Nov 9, 2019",NEGATIVE,could have been done in 40 minutes. 
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,"This movie was not a happy movie, but it was definitely the best movie I've ever seen in its entirety in the best performance I've ever seen. I'm surprised that I feel this way but it was truly amazing."
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,Absolutely phenomenal filmmaking
"Nov 9, 2019",NEGATIVE,it was a long and weird movie
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,It's a very depressing movie however it gives you a glimpse into the mind of someone who suffers from a mental illness.
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,Phenomenal performance!
"Nov 9, 2019",POSITIVE,Absolutely The Best movie of the year
"Nov 9, 2019",NEGATIVE,Worst movie of the year....
"Nov 6, 2019",POSITIVE,Great would like to see more of him play the joker.
"Nov 6, 2019",POSITIVE,Loved and enjoyed it
"Nov 6, 2019",POSITIVE,"Joaquin Phoenix did a fabulous acting job.  Overall, the movie was dark and depressing, but enjoyed the story and acting.  Would see again and/or recommend to friends."
"Nov 6, 2019",POSITIVE,"Leaves the (let's face it) silly trappings of comic book movies behind and paints a compelling portrait of a mentally disturbed man finding empowerment and meaning in violence in the face of an uncaring and often hostile society. Chilling in its plausibility. Phoenix once again shows that he's one of the finest actors on the screen right now. Highly recommended, but know that you're not getting a kid-friendly comic book film."
"Nov 6, 2019",NEUTRAL,"It is a dark portrayal of the Jokers origin. This movie does a good job of handling the sensitive issues around mental health and how a person and always be on the edge of a decline and many might not notice.
This is certainly not a movie for children!!!!"
"Nov 6, 2019",POSITIVE,I thought this movie was absolutely fantastic!!! It exceeded my expectations. I would see it again and again. DC does better when it stays gritty and dark.
"Nov 6, 2019",NEGATIVE,There was no story and unforgiving death to innocent people acting was not good enough!!
"Nov 6, 2019",POSITIVE,a great depiction of mental illness
"Nov 6, 2019",POSITIVE,"Joker is a sad and depressing movie. You won't feel happy and excited after watching. However, Joaquin's acting and performance was amazing, offering you a movie full of emotions so powerful you actually take his side for the majority of the movie."
"Nov 6, 2019",POSITIVE,One of the things about this movie is the fact that it works on so many levels it works well it as a joker movie it works as a batman origin story it dose every thing that I should do and it's just over all a grate film
"Nov 6, 2019",POSITIVE,"As a stand alone film, it is a brilliantly grounded retelling of the Joker's origin story. Emotionally packed, twisty, and incredibly relevant. I pray to God it won't be in any ""film universes."""
"Nov 6, 2019",NEGATIVE,"1/2 for good cinematography.  We didn't pay to see it at an industry screening and I still feel ripped off.   The story is ludicrous and even in a comic book world utterly preposterous.  Three thirty-something wall street types beat up a clown?  In what world?   A late night talk show host playing video of a failed comedian's first time on stage?  Hello - no legal team would allow it.  I want my time back.  My husband said it better than I could sum it up:  ""That film should go _________ itself""."
"Nov 6, 2019",POSITIVE,Interesting take on the becoming of a villain.  Most movies have focused on the stories behind the heroes and dont delve into the secrets that lye within the villains. Real world like. Good movie.
"Nov 6, 2019",POSITIVE,It was intense. Im giving it a 5 becaose the acting as amazing :)
"Nov 6, 2019",POSITIVE,"Great cinematic experience, watching the sanity decline in the character was intense"
"Nov 6, 2019",POSITIVE,"This was a heartbreaking movie. From the very first scene, we see how many in society really feel about those with conditions that make them different. Joaquin Phoenix does an amazing job pulling you in to his world. Dont expect a lot of laughs, this aint your daddys Joker. Cant wait to see it again!"
"Nov 6, 2019",NEUTRAL,just seemed to drag on
"Nov 6, 2019",POSITIVE,Loveeeed it. Everything about it!
"Nov 6, 2019",NEUTRAL,It not an action movie my husband thought it was a joker Batman movie it's about mental illness
"Nov 6, 2019",NEUTRAL,"It should be watched, and it is a good film.
Not a big fan of this kind of performance, theatre and cinema are not the same.
It is slow and too pretentious for my taste.
And we missed the cool side, the one that makes joker a symbol, to favourite something more easy to sell.
It is a movie for who thinks to know Cinema"
"Nov 5, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Great character development, no plot line."
"Nov 5, 2019",POSITIVE,Intense but brilliant performance by Phoenix.
"Nov 5, 2019",POSITIVE,Dark and amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix!!  Academy award worthy!!!
"Nov 5, 2019",POSITIVE,I loved every minute! Incredible Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. 
"Nov 5, 2019",POSITIVE,"it was slow in the beginning, but the mental illness buildup was well worth it to the spectacularly violent end. let's get this revolution started."
"Nov 5, 2019",POSITIVE,Watch this movie for the fourth time still enjoying it
"Nov 5, 2019",POSITIVE,"One of the greatest movies of all time. Especially for our time. It is disturbing because it accurately reflects our society back at us, making us fear what we have created."
"Nov 5, 2019",NEGATIVE,Was a really slow moving movie.  Could.have been 30 mins shorter and more action.
"Nov 5, 2019",POSITIVE,No tengo palabras para expresar lo triste y trastornan te q es la vida del joker
"Nov 5, 2019",NEUTRAL,The movie was ok. Took too long to get to the point and I know the writers are not trying to say Joker is Bruce Wayne's half brother. Not cool!
"Nov 5, 2019",NEUTRAL,Great acting but very dark movie depicting a man with severe problems cheered by the local  society who started rioting against the normal folks.  Reminded me how our current young people are moving in that direction.  Walked away shaking my head but it's been pulling in the people and certainly will be nominated for several awards.
"Nov 5, 2019",POSITIVE,Best movie of 2019. It's a masterpiece.
"Nov 5, 2019",POSITIVE,One of the best movies I've ever seen.  Worth not only the ticket price but also the popcorn and soda!  This is a fantastic character study of a man beaten by society.  Forget all the comic book connections; this is a great film!
"Nov 5, 2019",POSITIVE,"This is a must see movie! Great writing, great acting, and great directing! This cast and crew deserve awards for a stellar production."
"Nov 5, 2019",POSITIVE,I loved it. Jaqouin Phoenix was phenomenal. Best joker yet. Can't wait for the sequel.
"Nov 5, 2019",POSITIVE,More violent than I thought it would be. But the actor did a great job of portraying the character going mad.
"Nov 5, 2019",POSITIVE,"I liked it, and I am ready for part two. Joaquin was perfect for this part, absolutely phenomenal! No one else could have played the part like he did. I was uncomfortable the entire time! I just thought it was a tad bit slow for the first hour or so, but maybe it was necessary..."
"Nov 5, 2019",NEGATIVE,The epitome of beating a dead horse.
"Nov 5, 2019",POSITIVE,Good story but its a bit slow paced. I DO like the detailed information about how Aurthor became the Joker as well as adding in Bruce Wayne to the movie.
"Nov 5, 2019",NEGATIVE,"Too dark, realistic violence not entertaining. Minimal plot."
"Nov 4, 2019",POSITIVE,"It is an Once in a lifetime role for Joaquin Phoenix but in few instances it seemed forced or rehearsed. I thought it needed another character with slightly more brighter life to bring in more contrast in the main character - to pronounce the effect of ignorance, neglect, abuse, and loneliness. Not everybody is clown and not all clowns are like Joker. Yes the plot is how he became like this but I thought there is room for more improvement so that it moves us more. Some of the shots with or without people are memorable. "
"Nov 4, 2019",POSITIVE,"This is probably the first time I feel the urge to write a review on a movie because I was truly disappointed by the feedback that it had received. With the movie fresh on my mind, I can easily say that I was beyond astonished by its captivating plot that kept me on the edge of my seat as I observed the ticking time bomb that was Arthur Fleck. Of course, such a plot could only be executed by a star like Joaquin who could make a character originating from a comic book actually seem like someone we ignorantly pass by in the streets on a daily basis. Yet I could see why this movie would fail to impress a more superficial crowd as it is only the pained who can truly understand art, which is why Arthur slams himself into the cold metal of the cage that is the society he lives in so he can feel more pain until he understands more of the ""art"" around him (though in his own uniquely unnerving manner). All in all, I believe the Joker opens your eyes to how confidence can be achieved by wearing red, but not always in the way that you'd think, glorified or not."
"Nov 4, 2019",NEGATIVE,It was disturbing and dark. A movie I would only watch once.
"Nov 4, 2019",POSITIVE,I love the story behind the making of the “joker”
"Nov 4, 2019",POSITIVE,"Fucking amazing, best movie I've ever seen."
"Nov 4, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix did an amazing job! Beautiful imperfection.
"Nov 4, 2019",NEGATIVE,Very hard to watch. Not a lot to like.
"Nov 4, 2019",POSITIVE,Amazing movie...left speechless towards the end.
"Nov 4, 2019",POSITIVE,best comic book character origin story ever made.
"Nov 4, 2019",POSITIVE,"I actually enjoyed it!  It was not an action movie, so if that is what your looking for you wont find much within this movie however the end does have a bit. It was a sad story but really did a nice job laying out background of Arthurs life and I could see a sequel in the making!  Still so much to tell."
"Nov 4, 2019",POSITIVE,"very good, could have been longer but maybe there will be a sequel. the ending was perfect. not an all time great movie but I was very please to see they dont sugar coat anything and make the character complexe"
"Nov 4, 2019",POSITIVE,"Great movie, the acting was amazing!  I highly reccomend it!"
"Nov 4, 2019",NEUTRAL,The movie made it so we now know why the Joker was so weird. It was powerful!
"Nov 4, 2019",POSITIVE,it made joker more realistic. it shows how mental illness without help can get worse without help.
"Nov 4, 2019",POSITIVE,"I hate movies where you can predict the next scene or outcome. This wasnt one of those. I also like the serious theme that DC movies strive for, but has failed to successfully deliver consistently. The greatness of this film makes it all the more insulting that Justice League is associated via the same franchise. Phoenix did an excellent job remaking Joker. Ledgers was my favorite, but this may be a 1A vs a close 2nd."
"Nov 4, 2019",POSITIVE,Better than i expected. Kudos to Joaquin Phoenix on a classic portrayal of a maniac clown
"Nov 4, 2019",POSITIVE,We liked the main character. He really played his character well. It was a bit dark but my boyfriend loved it and said it could of been a bit darker.
"Nov 4, 2019",NEGATIVE,"Derivative. Thought it was better than it was. Watch NETWORK, TAXI DRIVER and KING OF COMEDY instead."
"Nov 4, 2019",POSITIVE,very twisted in the views of mental illnesses
"Nov 4, 2019",NEGATIVE,"no real story line. just a sick man and his demise. the acting is good, but Joaquin probably isn't even acting."
"Nov 3, 2019",NEUTRAL,He will probably win the Oscar.  It was pretty boring and all he did was laugh constantly.  Which annoyed me.  I really would like to have my 2 hours of my life back.   My friend was crying at the end and loved it.  My husband didnt like it at all.
"Nov 3, 2019",POSITIVE,How did the critics not rate this higher?
"Nov 3, 2019",POSITIVE,"disturbing and brutal, and worth seeing."
"Nov 3, 2019",POSITIVE,loved it but it is definitely not for everyone
"Nov 3, 2019",POSITIVE,Unbelievable perfect from Phoenix! Academy Award consideration!
"Nov 3, 2019",POSITIVE,A very interesting version of the Joker! Full of surprises.
"Nov 3, 2019",NEUTRAL,Acting was exceptional but story line was too drawn out.   Should have cut some of the middle and added to the end.  😉🌈❤️😊
"Nov 3, 2019",NEUTRAL,The movie had some boring moments where I wanted to fall asleep. The movie finally picked up it was pretty good movie overall
"Nov 3, 2019",POSITIVE,"Very disturbing story. Joaquin Phoenix is unbelievable, though it’s difficult to watch. Amazing performance by Phoenix."
"Nov 3, 2019",POSITIVE,"A riveting art house take on Batman’s greatest villain, without the Batman.  Joaquin Phoenix immerses himself completely and has you worried for him as an actor while you worry about his character.  You cannot help but be mesmerized until the very end, but at the same time, not sure you want to ever see it again."
"Nov 3, 2019",POSITIVE,"I have to admit it took a while for the action to speed up .However, once it did  I enjoyed the movie."
"Nov 3, 2019",POSITIVE,"Joker delves into the minds of the mentally ill. this show helps explain how the joker began.  if you're looking for a Batman type movie, you will be disappointed. if you're looking for a very interesting intense dive into mental illness, you will enjoy this movie.  Joaquin Phoenix does an excellent joker falling down the rabbit hole."
"Nov 3, 2019",NEUTRAL,"It was very slow in the beginning, but finally picked up towards the end."
"Nov 3, 2019",POSITIVE,"It keeps to the idea of One bad day can reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. Amazing performance, dark but relatable."
"Nov 3, 2019",POSITIVE,One of the best origin stories ever created-has to be both an Oscar worthy picture and performance.
"Nov 3, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix is stellar
"Nov 3, 2019",NEGATIVE,There were a lot of boring parts and there are interesting parts.
"Nov 3, 2019",POSITIVE,Everything... Fantastic origin story of The Joker... I hope Joaquin wins the Academy Award for Best Actor
"Nov 3, 2019",POSITIVE,Just an amazingly well put together movie
"Nov 3, 2019",POSITIVE,"To experience it, you have to see it for yourself. A MUST SEE!"
"Nov 1, 2019",POSITIVE,Psychologically In-Tense simply Epic.                       “As kids we loved the heroes..as adults we understand the villains”
"Nov 1, 2019",POSITIVE,The character development was amazing!  Phoenix is absolutely Oscar worthy!  The best film I have seen in years.  I completely forgot I was watching a DC character  movie!  BRAVO!!
"Nov 1, 2019",POSITIVE,A helluva back story!
"Nov 1, 2019",NEGATIVE,It was long and boring.
"Nov 1, 2019",POSITIVE,Excellent movie. Its a serious and slow movie where you have to pay attention but the story is really good. You actually feel bad for the guy and understand his transformation to insanity. I highly recommend this movie to any Batman fans.
"Nov 1, 2019",POSITIVE,"It was a movie that made me feel such a rollercoaster of emotions. From discomfort to sympathy to laughter to shock, this movie made me feel all of them and still kept me interested. It walked a tightrope of all those emotions and more and kept me hooked. Loved it."
"Nov 1, 2019",POSITIVE,"Powerful story on how our societies’ mental health systems are failing us. Joaquin Phoenix gives a heart wrenching performance as Arthur Fleck my heart broke for him as I too suffer mental illness. I am not typically a fan of marvel type movies, but when The Joker ended I felt like I wasn’t ready for it to be over. This film was very powerful in its message and actors performances and I would see it again."
"Nov 1, 2019",POSITIVE,oscar worthy performance
"Nov 1, 2019",POSITIVE,I cant believe how good it was. I'm glad they made a movie to show how bad mental illness is. an to leave people the fk alone.
"Nov 1, 2019",POSITIVE,Definitely a MUST see!
"Nov 1, 2019",POSITIVE,loved every min of it!! cant wait yo watch again!!
"Nov 1, 2019",POSITIVE,Genius acting great storyline
"Nov 1, 2019",POSITIVE,"dark. don't see it if you're not ok with dark, but it was a great performance."
"Nov 1, 2019",POSITIVE,Left me reeling and questioning my sanity. I felt like I was plunging into the abyss alongside Arthur. Amazing atmosphere and constant oppressive dread that would not let up. Perfect critique on our society. 
"Nov 1, 2019",POSITIVE,amazing dark deep journey if i had to sum this movie up
"Nov 1, 2019",POSITIVE,"Honestly, it was terrifying, sad, and absolutely beautiful."
"Nov 1, 2019",POSITIVE,"Such a controversial film but going in with an open mind will allow you to enjoy the film more. Incredible acting, cinematography, directing. Definitely one of the best origin stories that did the clown prince of crime justice."
"Nov 1, 2019",NEUTRAL,"I'm used to Joker as a chemistry and mechanical genius, a sociopath or an anarchist.

Perhaps Pheonix's character becomes this in the future, but I expected to see a flicker of that in this film."
"Nov 1, 2019",NEGATIVE,"Did not like the movie at all. I felt like it was way too graphic. The movie portrayed the killings as a norm. I almost feel like it gave justification for people with mental health problems and the bad behaviors they tend to have as being okay. Like it’s okay to commit heinous crimes if you have a mental health disorder. I walked out feeling extremely uncomfortable and on edge. Honestly, I felt like someone would get up from their seat at any minute and start shooting up the theater. That’s not a feeling you want to have after watching a movie. Unless, that was the whole point of Joker."
"Nov 1, 2019",POSITIVE,it was a slow intense build up. mental health us a thing proven in this movie.
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,"If there is such thing as a masterpiece, ""Joker"" has to be the closest thing I've seen to one."
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,"Brilliant movie, superb acting.  The only let down was that while it was cast in the Batman universe there really was no reason for it.  Because it was in the Batman universe I expected a bit more of the comic.  I would still recommend this movie and I would think it would be up for a lot of awards."
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,loved it. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing!!!
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,Excellent movie. I liked how the movie showed how we get to the places in life we are in. The acting was superb. It was gripping and raw.
"Oct 29, 2019",NEGATIVE,"I applaud Joaquin Phoenix for a noteworthy performance, but everything else just fell flat. I was hoping that the movie was just as twisted, quirky, and insane as they thought it would be."
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,Best movie of 2019!!!
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,Enjoyed the plot....now I understand the feud between joker and batman.
"Oct 29, 2019",NEGATIVE,It was okay not really what I expected
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,"This movie is a bit twisted, but a really, really well made. For anyone who can handle a movie about the dark side of mental illness, I would definitely recommend it."
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,Be movie in 2019 hands down!!
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,Great acting and storyline
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,Great film with an insight into insanity....
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,Story is done very well. The movie shows how real mental illness is and the struggles they can go through
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix is amazing in this role. A must see! This movie provides a good background to the Joker and how he came to be who he is.
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,"It really expressed the true nature of mental health, and how desperately important it is to seek help.  It also displayed how truly terrifying it can be for the government to abandon us when we are at our most vulnerable times.  It was an absolute masterpiece."
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,This movie was great! Cant wait to go again!
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,Loved how the movie told the story of the Joker and still linked his story to Batman.
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,The violence was somewhat realistic and was not meant for the kids some parents brought into the movie. Otherwise it brought in the background the series needed.
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,Omg! I absolutely loved this movie! Joaquin Phoenix is awesome playing Joker! He nailed it!!! I could see it again & I never watch a movie twice! Everyone should see this movie!! My son and I really enjoyed it!
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,It kept me up all through the movie I really enjoy it he was some crazy person I love it from the beginning to the end I will recommend this movie to everyone to see it👍🏽
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,Phoenix in his best role yet.
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,The movie made the Joker very relatable. Almost makes me question my judgement. Cinematography is amazing and Joaquin Phoenix is a badass.
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,Mental illness is real.
"Oct 29, 2019",NEUTRAL,Took too long to get to the point.
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,Unexpected and very new.
"Oct 29, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Goes deep into his story, which is interesting and Phoenix is amazing in the role. However, it's sort of slow moving through most of the movie, drags a bit at times, so that's a bummer."
"Oct 29, 2019",NEGATIVE,I was expecting more action. It was more of like storytelling
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,"The theme, The writing but especially the lead roll"
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,"Theres nothing funny about this dark, violent, expertly threaded film. How the Joker morphs into being is beautifully illustrated in a completely plausible way.  Joaquins performance will leave you feeling rattled."
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,"El dolor..... el sufrimiento...Las heridas...

como puede un ser humano reponerse a las heridas de la infancia? Hasta que punto pueden un hombre o una mujer rehacerse desde de sus cenizas, cuando la pobreza, la desabilidad fsica o mental y la falta de amor y oportunidades lo han convertido en un humano que se desvaloriza ? Que puede hacerse cuando el ambiente nunca cesa de ser hostil? l , buscando rescatar la fuerza interior que lo salve del desastre en un amigo, un tutor, un maestro, compaeros , en su madre en la calle algo que le sostenga en su cada y le recuerde su belleza y su dignidad. Pero para muchos, ese angel nunca aparece.

Una historia de injusticia y dolor, pero tan real como la vida de tantos seres humanos. Una vida de abuso durante la infancia, una enfermedad mental, un ambiente donde nadie te ve como ser humano sino como basura no lleva a nada bueno.

Detrs de cada ser humano hay una historia que necesita ser escuchada. Por eso es necesario mirar a los seres humanos con compasin antes de juzgar.

Dice Eckhart Tolle: ""Cuando te veas tentado a juzgar a una persona piensa: 'Si su pasado fuera tu pasado, si su dolor fuera tu dolor, si su nivel de conciencia fuera tu nivel de conciencia, pensaras y actuaras exactamente como l o ella'. Esta compresin trae consigo perdn, compasin y paz"".

Se trata de acercarte con compasin a quienes sufren y alentar sus vidas. Se trata de no juzgar lo que no sabemos. Que distinto seria el mundo si mirramos a cada ser humano con compasin. URGE EDUCACIN EMOCIONAL Y ESPIRITUAL consciencia de la importancia de la salud mental y emocional desde nios!!! Que los padres tambin se atiendan! Es la base de todo...para que tanta educacin intelectual cuando lo importante es el gestionar las emociones, sanar heridas y reconstruirse ..

LA actuacin de este hombre me lleg al alma , esa risa llena de dolor e impotencia. Me encant la pelcula llena de consciencia y mensaje"
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,What a movie!!! Awesome!!!
"Oct 29, 2019",NEGATIVE,The absolute worst movie I have seen in 20 years
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,"I thought it was very good, some scenes were intense. Joaquin was amazing in it. I loved the music played during some scenes."
"Oct 29, 2019",NEGATIVE,This movie was a train wreck.  One of the worst I have seen.  I wanted to leave but stayed to see if it approved....it didnt
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,the brakes are off on this runaway train...I enjoyed every minute of it
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,"Sublime performance by Phoenix, music was incredible, cinematography was perfect. Wow. Cant wait to see it again."
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,Hauntingly hilarious! Frighteningly funny! Joker brings us to a new level of sadistic humor. Phoenix is quite possibly the most underrated actors of the modern era of cinema. Dont forget to smile!
"Oct 29, 2019",NEUTRAL,I get that it was about how he became the Joker- but it moved very slow and I went into it expecting more action.
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,I loved Phoenix's performance.  Watching his ascent into awareness was painful and beautiful.  Top Notch Oscar sht right there!  The movie was slow but he is a force!  Always has been...but his performance here was truly Epic.
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,Awesome! Stunning!! No words!!!
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,"The transformation of Arthur Fleck to Joker is awesome and terrible, while does critic about social classes. Amazing."
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,"Very bloody, but great story."
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,The best joker I've ever seen
"Oct 29, 2019",NEUTRAL,The story had a lot of room for improvement!!
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,"Hands down, one of the most intricately crafted movies!"
"Oct 29, 2019",POSITIVE,"Dark, uncomfortable & heavy.
Loved every minute!
Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant!"
"Oct 28, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Joaquin was amazing, but the plot was a little muddy for me."
"Oct 28, 2019",NEUTRAL,"The storyline was not what I expected, it was ok. A little dark natured for me."
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,"J. Phoenix was a vision of ""master class"" from beginning to end. Complex and very sad character. Story took many twists and turns. Very different role for him and he pulled it off artistically and with great accomplishment. The musical score was brilliant as it aligned with each scene."
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,A captivating experience following how the most notorious batman villain came to be. Truly an emotion swaying film and one you must be ready for
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,Amazing movie! Perfect Joker story.
"Oct 28, 2019",NEGATIVE,depressive and excessive violence
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,Epic tale of humanity.
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,"Excellently done,
Must see."
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,A film experience so rare that it seems to come once a decade. Joker is that film. 
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,Took a while for the action to pick up but it was worth the wait!
"Oct 28, 2019",NEUTRAL,I thought it was okay.
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,A different spin but it works!
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,Very dark but VERY good
"Oct 28, 2019",NEUTRAL,Actors were fantastic- but overall movie was very dark and disturbing.
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,"In a weird way it made me begin to sympathize with the Joker. Very well done. I usually have a hard time staying awake watching movies, but this one kept me engaged the entire time. Well worth watching."
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,I liked how it exposed mental illness and its connection to reality.  Maybe casting light on mental illness will force society to accept that its a true disease and needs to be treated as such.
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,Excellent movie.   I cant imagine portraying the part.   Never lost interest.   Waiting for the Bruce Wayne sequel.
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,"The settings, props, cinematography, were great and Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic.  I wish the movie had spent a bit more time in the characters alienation, isolation and descent into madness but all I all this was an intelligent movie that touched upon a lot that is relevant today."
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,"there no movie like this one, and that's alone, is enough.
highly recommended."
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,The acting . The scenes . Everything well executed
"Oct 28, 2019",NEGATIVE,probably one of the worst movies ever. I have no interest in watching the desperate struggles of a mentally ill and abused man.
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,"Phenomenal piece of film. This is a different take on the Joker, somewhat following along with ""The Killing Joke's"" origin. Nevertheless it is a great ""origin"" that tackles themes of poverty, mental illness, existentialism, ethics, and the current state of how society deals with relationships and encounters with strangers. The score is incredible and the scenes are filled to the brim with content to extract. Every actor, especially Phoenix, is acting at the top of their game and it makes for a truly immersive film. The character development of Arthur as a mentally ill loner into a revolutionary anarchist is well drawn out and clear in it's shift."
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,Suffering captures your soul and makes you justify his mistakes
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,The Joker is such a realistic and raw portrayal of generational trauma and mental illness in this country. The cast and crew did a phenomenal job with this movie.
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,"It’s been a long time since I’ve been in a theater, and i’m glad that I chose to watch Joker. I am very much aware of the “best joker” debate, and I would like to say that they are incomparable. Phoenix really played a far different joker than I would have imagined, far more different from the other depictions also. The slow transformation into the joke was incredible to watch, and the sudden realities checks were exciting. This movie has perfectly depicted the hardships and inequality this society suffers, and unlike the jokers that came before, this joker represents something new and different."
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,"The story about the Joker was sad, almost heartbreaking.  It shined a spotlight on mental illness, child abuse and the simple lack of support from society."
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,"Disturbing, Creepy and Brilliant"
"Oct 28, 2019",NEGATIVE,"I really wanted to like this because the performances were fantastic and the cinematography was gorgeous, but if I'm honest, I found myself bored while watching Joker. It could have worked as a character study without being attached to the DC universe, but as a comic book movie, this was just bleak and bland. An origin story for Heath Ledger's enigmatic, chaotic Joker would have been much more interesting."
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,"Not a great movie, but interesting and troubling. Makes you think. Joaquin Phoenix is terrific."
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,Very dark however acting was superb!
"Oct 28, 2019",NEUTRAL,"The movie starts off a little slow, but it does that in order to tell the story. This movie can be an eye opener for anyone in regards to mental illness, and how society as a whole treats it."
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,"Good movie, it shows how people can really lose their mind with a series of bad events.  Unpredictable but a great performance by the cast."
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,Well done. Joaquin Phoenix was phenomenal.
"Oct 28, 2019",POSITIVE,Not a comic movie but a great example of mental health and the birth of the Joker!
"Oct 24, 2019",POSITIVE,"Phenomenal movie
Loved it being more of a mental health issue, pushed over the edge instead of the normal comic-booky type"
"Oct 24, 2019",NEGATIVE,"I just finished watching Joker and I have to say it was a rather disturbing experience. 

Anyone who knows the history of the character knows that its a very dark and disturbing origin story. Its depicted on the big screen as a combination of mental illness, post-traumatic stress disorder due to childhood abuse, and a traumatic brain injury/neurological disorder. 

The film is also a disturbing depiction and allegory for the current socio-economic and political upheaval going on in our country and in the world in general.  I really couldnt help but think that some marginalized individual is going to take this movie as inspiration to re-create some of the mayhem depicted on the screen. And I think more so with this film that focused on a single character in his dark origin than any of the previous movies in which he was one part of a more obviously almost cartoonish action flick. 

  In any event, I dont think it added anything that we didnt already know or that the DC universe need. It just left me wondering how this has become entertainment and regretting having contributed to its box office. 

  Just my opinion though. Maybe I am becoming the old get off my lawn guy. You might feel differently."
"Oct 24, 2019",NEGATIVE,Boring I get it was a character build but it built too sliwly
"Oct 24, 2019",POSITIVE,Amazing movie. Best movie of the year. 👍👍
"Oct 24, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Good, but not great. It's difficult to pass the blame onto others."
"Oct 24, 2019",POSITIVE,Highly disturbing film that nevertheless kept me fully engaged. The film offered another view of Batman lore that was very intriguing.
"Oct 24, 2019",POSITIVE,One of the best origin stories
"Oct 24, 2019",POSITIVE,"One of the best, if not the best comic book movie. The one scene you go from shock to laughter is genius. As is the quote about comedy being subjective. Fantastic film!"
"Oct 24, 2019",POSITIVE,"The only reason I watched this was because the critic ratings were so bad that I had to see it for myself. To my surprise I think this is Joaquin Phoenix's best performance of his life.  The critics are so out of touch that they believe 2019 Batwoman for the CW is better that this, let that sink in. "
"Oct 24, 2019",POSITIVE,"I’m not a fan of the genre, but this one is an exception. The screen play was interesting and the acting was excellent. My only disappointment was it ended so soon!"
"Oct 24, 2019",POSITIVE,It was very well written. Joaquin Phoenix was awesome as usual! I enjoyed the movie & actually felt sorry for the Joker!
"Oct 24, 2019",NEGATIVE,Still haven’t found a better Joker than Jack Nicholson. Not really worth the hype.
"Oct 24, 2019",POSITIVE,One of the rawest piece of cinema I've seen. I want to see more of these in Superhero/Comic Book films in the future.
"Oct 24, 2019",POSITIVE,the acting was amazing!
"Oct 24, 2019",POSITIVE,"simply amazing, definitely what you'd expect from watching a movie about the joker, it's chaotic, and filled with mysteries. definitely will watch it again"
"Oct 24, 2019",POSITIVE,Oh my! What an experience! I was unsure of this movie but after seeing it I am in shock. This is the best acting I have ever seen in a movie ever! Definitely the best film of the year so far.
"Oct 24, 2019",POSITIVE,This movie gives the viewers a lot to think about on a variety of levels. 
"Oct 24, 2019",POSITIVE,"Como una mezcla de el arte más puro de antaño de calidad y un tributo enorme a la psicología del príncipe payaso del mal la obra de Todd Philips nos lleva a un viaje profundo y crudo de la mente de un enfermo mental en una sociedad extrema decadente no tan alejada de la realidad.
Las muchas emociones que sucumben en ti al verla te llevan a concientizar con Arthur como a incomodarte con el pero siempre aprecias el notorio y sublime personaje que es de la mano de la epifanía actuación de Joaquín Phoenix. 

Todo en esta película te dice clásico y te da una de las más obvias pero duras críticas a la sociedad el sistema y las personas como espejos de este además de recordarlos la amabilidad al prójimo y lo importante de una buena salud mental. "
"Oct 24, 2019",POSITIVE,What a remarkable amazing movie ! Joaquin phoenix wow I pray you get all the awards that is available to get !!!
"Oct 24, 2019",POSITIVE,"The whole story line was cast into doubt by the Joker’s final scene in the asylum. Did he dream the entire move? If not, how did he get captured? Did he kill the psychologist in the end or was the last scene just surreal?  I don’t know."
"Oct 23, 2019",POSITIVE,This is how you do a dc movie
"Oct 23, 2019",POSITIVE,very well acted and depicted
"Oct 23, 2019",POSITIVE,I enjoyed this film and how it explored different themes of Jokers life and what led to his insanity and conditions.
"Oct 23, 2019",NEGATIVE,Killing ppl doesn’t justify the things you have been through or sadness in your life.. I didn’t like the story. Actors justified their parts!
"Oct 23, 2019",NEGATIVE,Boring story. flat lined. entire story could have been told in a third of the time. save your money.
"Oct 23, 2019",POSITIVE,Slow to start but ends with a bang!

"Oct 23, 2019",POSITIVE,Super awesome movie ! You won’t understand it unless you watch it yourself ! I give it a 5 stars!!!
"Oct 23, 2019",POSITIVE,This movie was exactly what I was hoping for delivered in an intriguing and well-told way. Best DC movie yet.
"Oct 23, 2019",POSITIVE,Spectacular performance!
"Oct 23, 2019",POSITIVE,This is a very important film because it illustrates real issues and epidemic of today.  Very sad film but must see.
"Oct 23, 2019",NEUTRAL,"I was not a fan of the storyline. Acting was great, that’s why I gave it 3 stars instead of 1."
"Oct 23, 2019",POSITIVE,"The Joker was an amazing character piece that should scare all of us. It shows the depths of society, the roots of crimes and shootings. People who believe this film is only for right-wing, conservative men who voted for Trump are delusional. "
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,Loved the movie. His performance was excellent.  
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed watching the Joker. It was a dark and concerning take on the character and his history.   Wow the Joker has some real issues. I am not sure of its comic book accuracy, but I it does not change myopinion of the movie. I enjoyed the ride and would recomend."
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,Slow Phenomenal Burn
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,So good! It was a great movie - terrific acting and very well written
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,Dark Movie. A great film!  Joaquin Phoenix was great and Oscar worthy!

"Oct 21, 2019",NEUTRAL,"It was an amazing movie, just very emotionally heavy"
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,"I thought it was exceptional. Joaquin Phoenix played a great ""Joker."""
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,"Great movie, really makes you sympathize with the joker and why he gets to the way he is this is a great movie "
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix performance is superb!
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,This movie is truly genius! I had to watch it a few times and a couple of YouTube videos on it because it thats deep! An initial overview might make some think this movie was horrible but it is truly a masterpiece!!!
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,Juaquin Phoenix should receive a best actor award for his performance.
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,Liked it it has a relatively truth to the way they treat people with mental illness today
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,"Joaquin Phoenix made this possible, I don’t think hunk they would of pulled it his without him"
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,I liked this movie because it showed a story that was both interesting and just opened your eyes to see how the world truly is .
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,"Intense, engaging and sad. Couldn't watch THAT scene!, but am very glad I saw this movie."
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin's portrayal was great! The movie was unexpected and I like that.
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,"Provacative, disturbing, and well done.  Insight into what can happen when mental illness is ignored."
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,"I felt that it was well directed and gives insight into how a clown named  Arthur became Joker. It gives a look inside the world of people with disabilities. In this case it was environmental. He was subjected to physical, mental, and emotional abuse as a child. His mother was mentally ill more over suffered from delusional and confused thoughts. Mainly, a personality disorder. As a mental health professional myself I can understand how people end up like the Joker in real life. He was dealing with a broken system that lost funding just like in real life. With out counseling and medications people suffer and can not manage their psychosis. The antagonist in this movie I would say was the guy worked with him and gave him a loaded gun knowing that Arthur was low functioning. Also the protagonist in the movie was Arthur. It's a must see I would not recommend it for light at heart. It has some extreme violence in the movie and its not recommended for a younger audience. "
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,A great performance from Joaquin Phoenix. Probably the best DC movie do far. 
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,a great look at a man descending into madness.

"Oct 21, 2019",NEUTRAL,Hype was better than the movie.
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,"Unexpectedly great movie. Great acting, directing, story and cinematography."
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,"Love it, Phoenix played a damn good Joker, had me on the edge of my seat."
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,"Very, very dark. Gratuitous violence without plot."
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,"What a thought-provoking masterpiece! The movie reminds you that the world ain't all sunshine and rainbows where we can all hold hands and sing kumbaya, it's a cold, dark, mean, nasty, and unforgiving place. It's a great commentary on mental illness and how many people struggling with mental illnesses aren't getting the help they need and how we can be insensitive to all of that and disregard these people."
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,Amazing performance!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,Excellent acting and imagery. Joaquin truly immersed himself into the character.
"Oct 21, 2019",NEUTRAL,"I thought the movie was good. It gave you an understanding of why the Joker became the person he is. It was a sad movie, pretty dark. Not a movie for kids."
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,"I like the in depth look into the Joker's life. Also, how it reflects the life and experiences of everyday people."
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,Very dark and disturbing just the way I like it. Very different from any other comic book movie. Joaquin Phoenix does an excellent job.
"Oct 21, 2019",NEGATIVE,"The  acting was excellent, however, the movie was dark, depressing and violent.  I was not impressed"
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal. An incredibly emotional and deep origin story for the most beloved DC villain there is. Cant wait to see it again!
"Oct 21, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Storyline was good, very dramatic, made joker a person with a life."
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,Brilliant performance. Dark and disturbing.
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,Very dark & a little slow moving but J. Phoenixs performance is Oscar worthy.
"Oct 21, 2019",POSITIVE,"Excellent plot, great music with good special effects."
"Oct 21, 2019",NEGATIVE,Too slow. Seemed to late in the game to present a story about the Joker. The only good part of the movie was the alley scene when Bruce Waynes father and mother were killed.
"Oct 21, 2019",NEGATIVE,"Dark, depressing, boring, and pointless."
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix is the second best joker ever.
"Oct 20, 2019",NEGATIVE,Horrible...painful to sit thru praying for it to end.
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,It was simply mind fucking
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,it was pretty good. not great but good. recommend.
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,"It was great, I wasn't bored not one bit watching this. The Joker is the anti hero here in this movie and ya can't help but cheer him on."
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,"Although the movie The Joker has a dark side, it's a must see. The acting performance by Joaquin Phoenix, allows you to not only see the Joker as a villain but a victim of his parents upbringing. It definitely a new insight of the portrayal of the Joker. I enjoyed this movie, the acting, and the storyline."
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,A masterpiece. So moving and eye opening. I would see it again and again!
"Oct 20, 2019",NEGATIVE,It was the most boring movie ever and a complete waste of my time
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,This is layered and good movie
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix holds the film....he is a convincing Joker b it wished the story line moved a little faster.
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,Not the film I expected but they went down a different path with this and I appreciated it!  And they made some ties to other source material which was great. Overall pretty good!
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed the movie.
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,Oscar winning performance!!
"Oct 20, 2019",NEUTRAL,It was really weird and uncomfortable but I guess that’s what they wanted!!
"Oct 20, 2019",NEGATIVE,Joaquin Phoenix was amazing.  The visual was amazing.  The script was awful and the movie was relentless.  I get that’s is a movie about a villain but there was no conflict or other characters that had substance.
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,"It was a great movie with a great plot, and had great actors to play their parts. It is a must see movie for DC comic fans and fans of movies"
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,Phenomenal movie. Best line and message from the movie the worst part about having a mental illness is that everyone expects you to act like you dont
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,What a phenomenal movie! It was everything I would expect of Joaquin and then some. I would highly recommend seeing it. I expect he is to win many awards for his performance. It was just truly admirable what he was able to do with the role.
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,uncomfortable but it was a realistic portrayal of mental illness
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie was well done! It was the build up to who he was and how he became Joker . It really helped to explain his character to all of the audience, whether you are a DC fan or not. Joaquin Phoenix did an awesome job in his depiction of the character we have know as Batmans arch-nemesis. Im so excited to see what they do next....."
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,The acting is excellent. it's a must see movie.
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,Phenomenal! Its an amazing study of the human psychology that leaves you shaken to your core.
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,Maybe the greatest acting performance in the history of films. A genius at work. We are all lucky to witness this performance.
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,"I hated the first three quarters or so. I didn't know if I was gonna make it through. But once he put that make-up on, that was it for me. I was got but good from then on."
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,I absolutely loved the movie.  I actually went to see it twice.  I even clapped at the end.  Must see.  I really felt bad for Joker.  He just needs a hug.
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,"i really liked how Joaquin came up with a different type of joker, he didn’t copy Heath Ledger. Loved the character change. Clear storyline. Amazing acting. Incredible movie overall."
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,I loved it. Kept us glued to the screen. It was a good breaking down of the character.
"Oct 20, 2019",NEUTRAL,"very slow paced, but very good character builder for The Joker."
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,"Amazing, all of it just wow!"
"Oct 20, 2019",NEGATIVE,"Not my kind of movie.  I shouldn't have watched it.  If you like disturbing egregious graphic violence, go see it."
"Oct 20, 2019",NEGATIVE,"Decent movie portraying a very different take on the genesis of a very well-known character. It feels like this movie would have been much better if had not attempted to disguise itself as a comic book movie. As it stands, the most dull and unappealing part of the film were the parts where it tried to present connections to the Batman/Bruce Wayne character."
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,"Very emotional..dark..well written, great acting. For mature audience."
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,"Amazing film!!! From the setting details, to the development of the iconic villain. Acting was breath taking, instantly drawn to every emotion the character went through. I have witnessed one of DCs greatest film of all time!! I couldnt have imagined this outcome. Loved the movie, the story, and the emotional rollercoaster ride!"
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,Amazing movie. Builds and builds until the climax. Worth seeing twice in theaters.
"Oct 20, 2019",NEGATIVE,Played out the mental illness way too long to where it got boring
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,"Joaquin Phoenix was amazing. I’ll be shocked if he doesn’t win the Oscar for his performance. Personally, I wasn’t prepared for the reality of the mental health crisis that is happening in every community in this country. Not sure this was the best portrayal the mental health crisis in this country."
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,Such an amazing movie! Oscars for everyone involved!
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,The movie was amazing.
"Oct 20, 2019",POSITIVE,Can’t wait to see him do more jokers
"Oct 20, 2019",NEUTRAL,"It's not a superhero movie Good character development, with well executed roles."
"Oct 19, 2019",POSITIVE,Great twists good ending. An interesting tale of a crazy person snapping.
"Oct 19, 2019",POSITIVE,The acting was SUPERB!!!!
"Oct 19, 2019",NEGATIVE,Too depressing and psychological. Ugh waste of my money.
"Oct 19, 2019",POSITIVE,Loved it! Joaquin Phoenix was awesome as the Joker!
"Oct 19, 2019",POSITIVE,Movie was great along with bringing awareness to mental health.
"Oct 19, 2019",POSITIVE,"I went to the movies with my son, an avid comics fan, with low expectations due to what the ""tomatometer"" critics were writing.

I WILL NEVER BELIEVE THE TOMATOMETER AGAIN!

This was a phenomenal reintroduction to a prominent villain from DC.  They did such a great job with character development that I am waiting for more from DC with great anticipation.  

It takes a great villain to make a greater super hero.  The connection between the Joker and Bruce Wayne will be a never ending, twisted, and endearing struggle from here on out.

Though I felt it had a slow start; I loved every minute of the movie once he found himself.  I was even caught by surprise (blindsided) by plot twists.

I am going to buy this one for the collection, and possibly go see it again at the theater "
"Oct 19, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix did a great job portraying the Joker. Somewhat disappointed by the rumors that the sequel will involve Batman and the Riddler.
"Oct 19, 2019",POSITIVE,Loved it!!! A real good reason to become the joker...
"Oct 19, 2019",POSITIVE,I loved how they tied everything up at the end but it took a long time to get there.
"Oct 19, 2019",POSITIVE,Amazing amazing amazing
"Oct 19, 2019",POSITIVE,This is one of the most poignant and beautifully disturbing films you will ever see.
"Oct 19, 2019",POSITIVE,This was one of the best movies I have seen.  Joaquin Phoenix was amazing.
"Oct 19, 2019",POSITIVE,A disturbing tale of DCs most disturbing villains.  I hope Todd Phillips does other DC Black Label projects.
"Oct 19, 2019",POSITIVE,Every second was worth the watch
"Oct 19, 2019",POSITIVE,Excellent Movie from beginning to end
"Oct 19, 2019",POSITIVE,Best movie of the year!
"Oct 19, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix was excellent.
"Oct 19, 2019",POSITIVE,Great movie . Starts out slow but finishes strong.  Definitely a very dark movie... no Superheroes here!
"Oct 19, 2019",POSITIVE,Phoenix is amazing in this dark and powerful movie.  I was sad a lot more than I expected and delighted with the finish.
"Oct 19, 2019",POSITIVE,"Very well acted and very well don. Beautiful, dark and tragic yet also has some dark comedic elements too but is gritty and real. Very thought provoking too very intense though. but a great movie overall"
"Oct 15, 2019",POSITIVE,"The story is great, gets you feeling for the character as a person but really goes into how he eventually becomes the joker which in a way is crazy because you root for this but also feel like am I the crazy one for rooting for it. It puts you in a dilemma where you think would I follow joker or be against him."
"Oct 15, 2019",POSITIVE,Great movie. I loved the different take on the story and the acting was amazing. Just be prepared it is super dark.
"Oct 15, 2019",POSITIVE,This is the best movie ive seen this year .
"Oct 15, 2019",POSITIVE,Amazing.  Joaquin Phoenix performance was spectacular
"Oct 15, 2019",POSITIVE,Definitely rated R. Not recommended for children. Good movie tho
"Oct 15, 2019",NEGATIVE,Too much setup for not enough payoff.
"Oct 15, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix  was amazing!!
"Oct 15, 2019",POSITIVE,"Phoenix was amazing, crazy good. The movie was deep and dark. Looking forward to a Joker sequel and/or a Batman/Joker movie."
"Oct 15, 2019",POSITIVE,The movie was phenomenal. if you are looking for a happy go lucky movie with a redeeming quality this is not for you. The movie at time was disturbing and it's not for the faint of heart.
"Oct 15, 2019",POSITIVE,"Just when I was thinking I might get bored, a nice twist came in and it finished strong!"
"Oct 15, 2019",POSITIVE,"A piece of art.. really portrays Jokers story... also the fragility of mental illness and causes the audience to think about how societal treatment affects others, amongst other factors that lead Joker to his breaking point."
"Oct 15, 2019",NEGATIVE,"While he puts in a good performance , the film is a badly made homage to Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy .
Its running time is just over two hours and it felt like I was watching this film for four hours . 
Do yourself a favor and wait for Netflix"
"Oct 15, 2019",POSITIVE,Such an amazing film! Beautifully tragic and unjustifiable yet understood. Faithful to the meaning of the character through and through.
"Oct 15, 2019",POSITIVE,A lot of symbolism that people won't understand.
"Oct 15, 2019",NEGATIVE,Very disturbing movie. Was expecting violence but not such a psychologically disturbing movie.
"Oct 15, 2019",POSITIVE,"Beautiful performances all around. Kinda hard to watch some parts, as a lot of the movie deals with mental illness, and its difficult to watch someone spiral out of control. But the purpose of art is to make you feel, so Id say Joker did its job."
"Oct 15, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant in this role
"Oct 15, 2019",POSITIVE,I think the joker was very intense. The actual story disturb me. I do think the main character was extremely artistic and talented. But it was a very disturbing movie — and sad
"Oct 15, 2019",NEUTRAL,Very slow start. Not sure what the big deal the media and law enforcement made? Natural Born Killers was way more violent and gruesome!
"Oct 15, 2019",POSITIVE,One of the darkes and most magnificent films ever made.
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Amazing story relevant to todays social issues.
"Oct 14, 2019",NEGATIVE,Very slow and borderline boring.  joaquin phoenix Played the character well though
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Captivating.  Joaquin should get best actor!   Great movie!
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix does it again....
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"Knock, knock,
Who's there?
Academy award winner Joaquin Pheonix!
Stellar performance"
"Oct 14, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Everything about this movie should have made it 5 stars - great acting, great storyline - but for some reason I left underwhelmed and even got bored at times.  Worth seeing but overall disappointing."
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"Great acting, great movie!"
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,The best movie I seen this year
"Oct 14, 2019",NEGATIVE,It was extremely long and drawn out.  It was very dark and erie.
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Good job by Joaquin Phoenix great movie but moved a little slow
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,If you want a comic book movie..skip this one
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"Intense and violent, but well acted and an interesting back story about Joker and how he fits into the Batman story. Great job by Joaquin Phoenix."
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,It was an absolute masterpiece...
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Great movie it actually got me to go watch batman i haven't really watched any before
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Great movie!! Pretty dark but it was a masterpiece!!
"Oct 14, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Ugly, tragic, occasionally beautiful. This works best if you pretend you've never heard of Batman or his arch-nemesis."
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"Most villains are comically bad caricatures, mustache-twirling monsters whose only purpose is to be defeated by the heroes. Not here: writing a believable villain that makes the audience understand why he is the way he is, in other words, how he's human is hard and the film nails that. Absolute must see character study. "
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"I'ts not the DC Joker everyone was running to the theater expecting to see, but do not let that deter you from seeing this movie.  I found it extremely entertaining as well as educational. Never underestimate the seriousness of mental health issues.  Additionally, it pays to be nice to those who are different from us.  It can literally save your life!"
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,The movie was spectacular! It really drew me in and kept me on my toes. It was a fun and thrilling adventure through a mind falling apart...on a character I remember well from my comic book days.
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Perfection - in every shape and form. Phoenix deserves an Oscar.
"Oct 14, 2019",NEGATIVE,Skip it. Didn’t know it was a dance movie. Heath Ledger is a much better joker
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"Short and Sweet: Even if you despise the genre, Joaquin Phoenix's performance is Superb, and that may be an understatement. Point being if you appreciate stellar acting, I'd highly recommend you go see this film."
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,It is very violent and disturbing but also very good.  It's worth seeing just for Joaquin Phoenix' performance.
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,sick movie definitely worth a watch!
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"One of the best storylines, one of the funniest movies in awhile (didn't expect that), an absolutely wonderful acting by Joaquin Phoenix, just enough violence, and an exact mirror of today's society. I never write reviews, I do rate movies, but this one was way and far above my expectations."
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"Feels so real you are swept away while watching Joker. What an intense, disturbing and captivating journey it is. You'll leave the theater saying ""I need time to process this, but damn it was good!"""
"Oct 14, 2019",NEUTRAL,Joaquin Phoenix's acting was awesome. The movie gave the joker a more realistic and darker touch.
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Saw this twice the week it opened. REALLY enjoyed it. Joaquin was terrific. 
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Love it !!! Amazing !!!
"Oct 14, 2019",NEGATIVE,Did not live up to the hype
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,I loved it. Anyone saying its to violent never saw the movie. 
"Oct 14, 2019",NEUTRAL,"The acting is brilliant, yet the plot so dark...it didn't develop any characters except the Joker.  I think he deserves an Oscar nomination, but the movie is just ok.."
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"“Jokers”, character was brought out after all these years in Gotham City. Who would have thought he was abused as a child, as well as his stepmother. This is the epitomy of mental illness carried from childhood to adulthood. Although “The Jokers” illness was controlled through medication, once removed from meds, his only alternative was to strike back to those who abused him in adulthood."
"Oct 14, 2019",NEUTRAL,Slow in the beginning
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Great film great content
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"Great movie! Definitely deserve another watch. Joaquin Phoenix performance was incredibly amazing. From Arthur Fleck ticks and mannerisms also some subtle details are stellar. From how he hurt himself from his laughing disorder to limp when he walks really makes Arthur sympathetic. Nevertheless, a psychopathic maniac with a nihilistic perception of the world. AGAIN, GREAT MOVIE."
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"this movie was awsome, one of the best acted movies ive seen. the new joker is amaizing."
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix was phenomenal.
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,I loved it! It was not predicting at all to me so it was just all types of insanely good.
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Great movie. Great actor. Great story.
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"Joker is a film about a man's transformation from the mentally ill loner Arthur Fleck to the widely-known villain Joker. This seems straightforward enough, but there are much deeper messages in this movie that apply not just to this fictional universe, but to our real world. 
Arthur is a man who has been beaten down by not just society but fate itself time and time again. He has been dealt, for lack of a better term, a shit hand and no one in his life seems to truly want to help him. He is a man that truly is alone in society, learning throughout the film how true that statement really is. 
While the actions committed by him are definitely wrong, we understand him and can even somewhat empathize with him (hopefully we can, I may just be weird). Unlike how some people like to suggest, this movie doesn't glorify the violence that Arthur causes. This movie shows how horrible people can be created by the environment they are living in. We are living in a time where we like to blame the violence around us on the insane people who start it. Shootings are happening more than ever, and the insane gunman is responsible for it. 
Of course, it cannot be denied that the gunman is at fault. There is clearly something wrong with the people who do these things. However, much too few people think, ""Why is this happening?"", ""Why are these people doing the things they do, and how can we stop them from doing this?"" We see the result of what happens when an at risk individual doesn't get the help he needs in this movie. What we need is a system that can actually help these people. 
The movie Joker differs from other comic book movies because it is not only grounded in reality, but it's messages can be directly applied to our world. People like Arthur Fleck, people who have been brutally beaten by life at every turn need a way to be helped. The rich and successful don't care about these people. These people are viewed as threats instead of who they really are: humans, just like everyone else. We need to create an outlet where these individuals can get the actual support they need, not stuff them with medication and let specialists with their own agendas pretend to care about them. 
Another argument I've seen about this movie is that it has no reason for existing. It shows violence and shows a unique portrayal of a popular character but it has no substance to it. As you can probably tell, I strongly disagree with anyone who believes this, and I truly believe anyone who thinks this completely missed the point of the entire movie.
In conclusion, this movie definitely has substance and doesn't glorify violence in the slightest. This movie brings up an issue in our society that we have been neglecting for far too long. There's a stigma about mentally ill people that we have to get over. People who have been neglected and have nothing left to lose are the most dangerous type of people, and the problem with our society is that we allow people to feel as if they have nothing left to lose. Arthur Fleck is just a person who never got any sign at all that he was needed or loved by society, or anyone for that matter. He is truly, as cliche as this may sound, a product of his environment. You can criticize this movie for being too dark but by doing so you're just dismissing the reality we live in.

"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Great movie and message. It may offend sensibilities for some but I was pleased with the outcome. A must see.
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix was incredible!  Movie was a bit slow. The scenes with him laughing over and over were a bit overplayed.
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"An amazing movie in a disturbing, thought provoking way.
Did it make me want to go out and hurt people?  The exact opposite, it made me want to be more empathetic and not be callous to others."
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"Amazing acting, soundtrack, and cinematography. I know the character and storyline are controversial but personally I think that it was a very honest, raw portrayal of mental illness. Its a very creepy, emotional movie hat has some gory scenes, but to be clear - I dont think that it condones violence at all, simply seeks to dig into the problems that we as a society have yet to face and shows how bad the outcome can be. Aside from the controversy, everything about this film is a masterpiece. The music, the lighting. Joaquin Phoenix. I would definitely see it again."
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"Good acting, good music, maintains interest throughout and an interesting ending to ponder - just goes a bit sideways at times."
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Dark but beautiful movie. Definitely on the Oscar list
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"Joker was utterly brilliant. If Phoenix doesn’t win the academy award for Best Actor, I’ll lose faith in humanity. "
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Best movie Ive seen in quite some time!
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"So human, the ignorance about mental illness in so many people and instead of helping somehow we make everything worse diminishing and making fun or talking insulting towards them"
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"Great movie, interesting story and explanation of Jokers history. Phoenix acting was award winning as well."
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Amazing look at the unstable mind and why people crack.  A must see movie!! You Do Not Need to be a Batman enthusiast to thoroughly enjoy this film.Joaquin Phoenix gives an exceptional performance! If you only pick 1 movie to see this fall.. Joker should be it
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Phoenix's performance is legendary.
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Absolutely amazing!!!!
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Movie was absolutely brilliant
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"I absolutely loved this movie. The way they portrayed the joker was phenomenal. Mental health is a running theme throughout the film, showing just how difficult times were and how our system views mental illness."
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Definitely unique for the comic book/anti-hero genre. This movie makes you feel emotionally invested in a character that you have known for a long time but now have to re-analyze and rediscover how you viewed him previously. Very engaging movie and awesome acting by Joaquin Phoenix!
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Amazing film.  Not ur usual. But had so many important messages.
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Depicts the story of Joker very well. It’s what you least expect and I love it! Beautiful performance
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,I stan comrade Joker!
"Oct 14, 2019",NEGATIVE,"A film acclaimed by internet film gurus that I genuinely do not get the hype for. I walked out wondering if they saw a different film than me. Todd Phillips mishandles one of comic book's most legendary characters and gives us a dreadful two hour, downright repetitive film. You really feel the directors struggle trying to compel us with the same scenes over and over. I lost count of the times the filmed stopped to show a slow motion, overly-dramatic scene of Arthur dancing or him maniacally laughing. Is that the extent of his filmmaking craft? Is there not a better story they could conjure up to give the character some meaningful development other than just beating him up for ninety-minutes? Apparently not. "
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Greatest movie Ive seen in theaters in a long time. A must see.
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Amazing performance by Joaquin
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Phenomenal acting.  Movie really makes you feel and think.
"Oct 14, 2019",NEGATIVE,Cool movie but took to long for him to become the JOKER!!!!
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix gives one of the best performances I have ever seen. His ability to project the vulnerability and rage of the character is phenomenal. It is by far the best origin story ever!
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Absolutely Beyond Incredible!!!!!!!! The Best Joker Ever!!!!!! A Must See!!!! Joaquin Phoenix was Exuberant in his performance!!!!!
"Oct 14, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Loved Joaquin-- as always a powerful actor. Disliked deviation from the sociopathic, unfeeling Joker of the comics."
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"Amazing
Brutal
Suspense"
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Beginning was fantastic all the way till the end
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,It was intense.  Joaquin Phoenix was superb.
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Absolutely phenomenal... was on the fence about it especially after the late great Heath Ledgers performance but I actually liked Joaquin Phoenix better.
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,The acting was award winning
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Do not believe the critics and media! It was awesome!
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"great acting,  great shots and the drama was intense and very current with what is going on in society."
"Oct 14, 2019",NEUTRAL,"mental illness sad,  in the case very dark and deadly. great acting, well done"
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"The entire movie was a master piece, a must watch for ALL."
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix was phenomenal as Joker!! Definitely an Oscar award winning role and performance!!!
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,A detailed and dark story on how Arthur became Joker! First movie to leave me speechless! It is also a look into how important it is to be aware of mental illness and how it can have an effect in someones life!
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed this movie! Great storyline. Oddly enough, was cheering for Joker the whole time haha"
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"This movie was brilliant. Keep in mind, this is a Joker origin movie of sorts, not the Wayne’s or Bruce, although they do play a part in the movie, especially Thomas Wayne. You get to witness what made him into the Joker we all love. Joaquin Phoenix IS our Joker now, in my opinion. He put on a spectacular show. Arguably the best in his career."
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,wow. i’m speechless. i would rate this a 6/5 if i could. joaquin phoenix’s portrayal of the joker is INSANE. i haven’t seen a movie this good in so long. i would definitely recommend watching.
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"One thing you should know about this movie is that it’s raw. It makes you feel like it’s real. You see a man slowly decline into madness from a world that’s very reminiscent of the one we live in now. Joaquin Phoenix fully engulfed himself in this role and it shows, he took The Joker and made it his own. Very good and original movie."
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Absolutely incredible. Best movie of 2019.
"Oct 14, 2019",NEGATIVE,Very bizarre movie. Not quite sure what to say other than that.
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,great movie...DEEP!!
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Phenomenal acting!!!
"Oct 14, 2019",NEGATIVE,"I was expecting more to the story line, more action or something. The movie just dragged."
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Turned out to be a pretty sad movie when you think about it but Joaquin Phoenix did an AMAZINGj job.
"Oct 14, 2019",NEGATIVE,"Not much action, suspense, drama, or anything at all remarkable. It painted a logical psychological prequel to the Batman movies, but was wholly boring throughout."
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"Not your typical DC/Marvel movie because it isn't one.. Amazing character development. A little morbid/violent that might turn some people off. Strong messages around themes of privilege and mental health. DC, take notes."
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Movie was an excellent and a refreshingly gritty new take on the most notorious villain.
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"Deserves numerous Oscar for the score, Juaqin's performencs, and the amazing cinimetography. Every scene was truly a masterpiece."
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Acting in this movie is superb by Joaquin Phoenix. I was captivated from the start watching Arthur trying to fit in in an unforgiven world. His struggle with mental illness and yet a duty to work and take care of his responsibilities while contributing to society is intriguing. It is a shame that the everyday pressures of coping in this world finally breaks something in him that can't be put back together. Also the way the film switches from reality to his delusions forces you to pay attention to all the cues. Although this is a tough subject matter I do hope Arthur or better yet Joker can be further developed into a sequel.
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"Slow start, but great build up to how the madness all began"
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,best rates R movie I have ever seen 
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,"Loved Everything, it followed the killing joke storyline. The ending was the best part when he was on the hood of the car. I will for sure see it again."
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Best movie I have seen in years. Absolutely love this Joker.
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,loved everyyyyyyything kinda slow but i thought it was worth it
"Oct 14, 2019",POSITIVE,Best Actor Oscar favorite
"Oct 13, 2019",NEGATIVE,This movie should have been rated NC17 for its violence.
"Oct 13, 2019",POSITIVE,5 stars: So Fresh: Absolute Must See!
"Oct 13, 2019",POSITIVE,This movie was genuinely one of the best movies that Ive ever gone to the theaters to see. I appreciate their take on the classic joker character with its twist on mental disabilities. Would recommend 10/10z
"Oct 13, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix was outstanding in this! Believe the hype..this movie IS awesome. Go see Joker if you haven't.🤡👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
"Oct 13, 2019",POSITIVE,Impecable performance by Mr. Joaquin Phoenix. An Oscar worthy. Will buy it as soon it comes out.
"Oct 13, 2019",POSITIVE,An absolute dark and gripping masterpiece the acting and cinematography I was in awe 
"Oct 13, 2019",POSITIVE,Great take on Joker’s origin story!
"Oct 13, 2019",POSITIVE,Great flic. Not for the casual fan looking for an action movie but more for a drama that builds a character that is later on terrifying and a worthy villain to a super hero movie. This movie really shows how society can mold certain people to become a danger to them selves and others . Mental Illness is real and  you see it in the movie and the build Up with joker was dark and heavy but really shows how demented the joker really is and how he gets to be the iconic villain he is.
"Oct 13, 2019",POSITIVE,It really built up the character of the joker and how he became so sick and demented.
"Oct 13, 2019",POSITIVE,"This was one of the best cinematic performances that I have ever witnessed in my life. It shocking and breathtaking, But very real and believable. So much so that I question the responsibility of making such a masterpiece, of this topic and nature."
"Oct 13, 2019",POSITIVE,Great performance. A beautiful interpretation of how the Joker became the Joker. Must see!
"Oct 13, 2019",NEUTRAL,"I fell asleep, I can understand why they made the majority of the movie based on story only, and how they’re setting up for #2 . But I wanted more from Joker. The last 40 minutes are the only parts actually intriguing"
"Oct 13, 2019",POSITIVE,"Great movie, great acting."
"Oct 13, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix IS the Joker...he's mesmerizing...
"Oct 13, 2019",POSITIVE,The movie always kept me on my feet with what the Joker was about to do next. It really drew on mental health issues and the need to be non judgemental and treat everyone with respect.
"Oct 13, 2019",POSITIVE,Was a pretty good movie. Scary! But good. I say scary cause with all the mass shooting going on in the world this movie almost glorify killing.
"Oct 13, 2019",POSITIVE,Phoenix had an excellent performance.  His portrayal of a man transitioning from fighting for his sanity only to finally snap was so real.  I kind of felt sorry for the character to a degree. I loved the plot and the progression of the character and storyline. The cinematography was fantastic. Great movie.
"Oct 13, 2019",POSITIVE,"Absolutely phenomenal! Joaquin will be nominated for GG, SAG, and Oscar I know it!"
"Oct 13, 2019",POSITIVE,"This is a great origin story, the callbacks to previous mythos are amazing. I'm glad of the direction they went in and it surprisingly humanizes a very notorious villain. I can't wait to see what direction they go in next."
"Oct 13, 2019",NEGATIVE,Terrible one dimensional movie. There was no True plot development. Jokers laugh was beyond irritating and not authentic. Ending tried to pull it together put should have been by 1/2 of movie.
"Oct 12, 2019",POSITIVE,Phenomenon acting and intreguing story telling. A must see!!
"Oct 12, 2019",POSITIVE,Best movie I've seen in some time now
"Oct 12, 2019",POSITIVE,the movie joker shows us the changing of a regular man to now a man who just wanted to become a comedian and got laughed about I got laughed at about it
"Oct 12, 2019",POSITIVE,It was very interesting to watch I thought it’d be like a happy thing then something horrible goes wrong in his life that was the stereotype I thought but after watching this film I was amazed this is a really good film
"Oct 12, 2019",POSITIVE,Amazing performance! Dark and dark!
"Oct 12, 2019",POSITIVE,Finally a good origin story! 
"Oct 12, 2019",POSITIVE,A very dark and disturbing look at mental health and how we as a society treat people with mental disorders
"Oct 12, 2019",POSITIVE,"This film is a 7 or 8 out of 10 for me. The critics are lying when they claim this film is disturbing and violent, and if you don't believe me watch the film for yourself as oppose to listening to 'intelligent critics.' The script can be cheesey at times but Joacquin pulls the dialogue off perfectly and is by far the best thing about this movie, I'm certain no one else could be better. Some scenes are occasionally overlong and it definitely thinks it's smarter than it really is, but all in all I can't wait to see it again "
"Oct 12, 2019",POSITIVE,"Dark, sad, and an emotional and mental rollercoaster. But the backstory connection and how it all comes together in the end was done masterfully. Joaquin's performance and Joker evolution was beautifully executed. Do not expect jolly-good action and adventure this is a movie that makes you think and feel. You need to see it."
"Oct 12, 2019",POSITIVE,Great movie and an all around amazing performance.
"Oct 12, 2019",POSITIVE,Good overall origin movie. Great acting by Joquain Phoenix
"Oct 12, 2019",POSITIVE,"Great Movie, original story portrayed in a realistic and madness world. Amazing acting and directing from bith Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips 
"
"Oct 12, 2019",POSITIVE,Loved it! It was very well directed. You have to go in with an open mind and think a little deeper than the usual! It’s definitely a must see!
"Oct 12, 2019",NEGATIVE,its ok first part is very boring but the ending was good
"Oct 12, 2019",POSITIVE,Great acting and a different take on the character. Makes you want to see it again.
"Oct 12, 2019",NEUTRAL,"It was disturbing and strange, but kept my interest. Very strange. I have mixed feelings."
"Oct 12, 2019",NEGATIVE,"Some people claim that the negative reviews for this film are due to it ""Offending"" people. This is not true. For this film to be offensive it would need to have a plot or a point. Instead this film is almost two hours of an untalented actor doing what looks like his shitty street theatre from the Fringe Festival occasionally broken up with scenes of him self pitying about how the neighbour whose name he doesn't know won't have sex with him or going on incoherent rants about how Mean Society Is To Him and how it Hurts His Feelings that people don't see how Special he is. If your a talentless 60 year old virgin living with their parents and working at Wal-Mart I'm sure this film might reward that sad part of you that's still convinced your Really Going to Do Some Important Stuff someday. For those of us who have actual lives and friends this film is a sad reminder of what absolute trash Hollywood continues to waste god knows how much money on.  "
"Oct 12, 2019",POSITIVE,Great prequel that ties everything together
"Oct 12, 2019",POSITIVE,"amazing story, true mental illness approach. A modern approach to mix art and health issues."
"Oct 12, 2019",NEGATIVE,Very slow for the first ⅔of the movie.  Was disappointed pretty much from the start.
"Oct 10, 2019",NEGATIVE,Not really sure how I felt about it tbh
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,"Not what I expected. Left feeling more disturbed than anything and for a movie on the Joker, that's exactly what I wanted."
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,"The Joker is epic, I've seen it twice and without a doubt Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar for his performance, the movie is amazing !! "
"Oct 10, 2019",NEGATIVE,"Disappointing 
Not well integrated with DC Universe"
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,IT WAS GREAT! This movie is supposed to tell the story as to HOW the joker became who he is. Its not expectant to be like the dark knight etc with total action. It looks deeper into mental illness and society as a whole. I loved how surprised I was by many twists in the story. I definitely felt uncomfortable with the bold music but loved the movie !
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,Great movie! Shows how mental illness really occurs and the signs surrounding it and the decline of the person and their environment
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,Excellent acting!!  The joker character was well developed.  Story theme was dark but well written.  Loved every minute of it!
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,"I can see why the critics rating are much lower than the audience rating. Joker however is not perfect in some areas, it's an amazing movie to watch. "
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,"Tactful, intelligent, and breath-takingly visceral. A deeply passionate character study first, a comic book movie maybe third or fourth. After his inspired performance in You Were Never really Here, Joaquin Pheonix has mastered acting the part of a complex, challenging character. He brings a dignity and grace to a franchise I previously thought was long dead and soulless."
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix one of his best acting Ive ever seen! Interesting story line a little bit  shocking
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,"Awesome depiction of the evolution of the Joker. The cinema, writing and acting were great, I will be seeing this again."
"Oct 10, 2019",NEGATIVE,I hated it from the beginning.  My 30 year old son loved it..  go figure hugh?
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,"Best Acting and it’s very realistic, deep and dark. Will win an Oscar for best movie , best actor, director, cinematography and more. It’s a Must See Movie!!!"
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,My anxiety was was at an all time high but for sure worth it.
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,The critics were sooooo wrong about this movie.
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix in a triumphant performance shows the humanity and the personal struggles of the man who becomes the Joker. Nice supporting cast including the great Robert Deniro. Great sets that depict the grim urban nightmare of Arkham and great costumes. This is a movie that lingers in your thoughts after viewing.
"Oct 10, 2019",NEUTRAL,I liked the fact that you can understand how The Joker came to be.
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,Best origin movie I have ever seen! Powerful and thought invoking. I watched it 2 hours ago and the more I think about it the better it is. Phoenix was brilliant! 
"Oct 10, 2019",NEUTRAL,"No action .. was more of documentary of an origin I've never seen or heard of before .. it's not the origin from the comics or other movies.  
Jaquin Phoenix acted this part amazingly though. His performance only good thing about the movie ... the storyline was awful and boring"
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,Excellent acting and beautiful direction.
"Oct 10, 2019",NEUTRAL,It was good to know how the Joker became who he is.
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,"Very informative into what made the villain the way he is, his motives. A very well written film that is deserving of an award or two. The acting was wonderful. Absolutely sequel worthy!!"
"Oct 10, 2019",NEUTRAL,It was rather disturbing to watch.
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,Love the origin and soooo happy Joaquin Phoenix played Joker.
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,Unnerving. Unexpecting. Brilliant. Dont assume anything about this Joker. It is a completely fresh take on the character and his descent into madness.
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,Amazing film! Such a dark and interesting character study into a mentally ill man on the edge.
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,"Haunting, disturbing, and depressingly dark.

Todd Phillips' psychological crime drama Joker (2019) is his most mature feature film yet. Certainly targeting adults only as Joker is brutal in its bloody violence, disturbing in its bleak perspective, depressing in its hopeless attitude, and dark in its somber tone for the entire duration of Joker's quick 122 minute run-time. Jeff Groth's editing cuts quickly from scene to scene without unnecessary explanations, creating a dream sequence feel to many of the Joker's scenes. You are disoriented by Groth's style in a fantastic way as you are forced to focus in on Arthur and experience his journey into madness.

Phillips directs Joker like its a real crime origin story instead of a standard comic book movie. Gone is the facade of green screen everywhere and visual effects propping up lackluster stories, writing, directing, and acting. Phillips outdirects every Marvel and DC film since The Dark Knight back in 2008. Joker easily rivals Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins and The Dark Knight for me. His influences are apparent as Todd Phillips takes his shot at crafting his own Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, Raging Bull, The Master, and You Were Never Really Here. Phillips pays homage without feeling like he's ripping off classic cinema. Phillips' direction is fascinating in his down to Earth approach with each scene. Joker is like a gritty documentary more than a thriller. He takes an indie drama feel into the blockbuster world of comic book villainy to enthrall into Arthur Fleck's nihilistic world of suffering as he devolves into The Joker. This grounded approach makes Joker feel more mature and nuanced than previous incarnations of The Clown Prince of Crime.

Joker looks incredible, but it's the emotional distress that Joker causes that makes the movie so powerful. Todd Phillips and Scott Silvers' script is an onslaught of misery as Arthur and the audience alike are pelted by cruelty, abuse, murder, outrage, corruption, and sorrow around every dirty corner within Joker. Phillips does question the mindset of the Joker as he's still the villain of the story, but we are following from his point of view. Society is the menace that destroys Arthur Fleck causing him to turn to mass murder, but Joker is still mad and wrong for his killings in the end as he's locked up for his perspective. Phillips gives his character's frame of mind a fair chance and an empathetic viewpoint through his compassionate storytelling that clearly wants audiences to relate to the most notorious comic book villain of all time. Todd Phillips has written and directed one of 2019's finest films hands down!

Furthermore, Lawrence Sher's cinematography is perhaps the most striking aspect to Joker. The stunning images flow like an urban ocean of oppression as the flawed society from Joker's mind is made real. The audience is subjected to all manner of dangerous thinking as the camera often holds on Joker's face in beautiful close-up shots that creates both a surreal view and a realistic depiction of anguish. 

Likewise, Mark Friedberg's production design harks back to the dirty cityscapes of Taxi Driver and the grungy rooms of You Were Never Really Here with a grotesque display of furnishings. I adored Mark Bridges' costume designs. The colorful red and green suit for the Joker's final ascension into crime is cool, playful, and creative. Bridges takes all the most famous designs of clown costumes and subverts into outfits a regular clown for hire might be able to slap together. His realistic designs are the stuff of movie magic!

Similarly, I have to mention the outstanding realistic make-up from Nicki Lederman, who deserves an Oscar for her work in Joker. The colors are vibrant, but her choices create the most haunting clown make-up ever captured on film. I think I now prefer the disgusting verisimilitude of Lederman's make-up to even Heath Ledger's Joker make-up in The Dark Knight. Nicki Lederman's make-up is really that effective!

Joaquin Phoenix gives 2019's most grueling and devastating performance of a broken man. Phoenix is astonishing as Arthur Fleck as his transformation from the muscle bound behemoth in You Were Never Really Here to the near skeletal frame of Fleck. His physicality derives an uncanny effect as you are repulsed by his appearance and strange movements. Yet, you sympathize with his Joker as he endures constant bullying and verbal abuse. The mental strain of society finally gets to him and Phoenix pulls off a more suddenly violent and rage filled Joker that even Heath Ledger's legendary anarchist portrayal. Phoenix allows his Joker to breathe in hopelessness and wallow in Arthur's misery as he cries, screams, and laughs his way into your heart. I felt just awful watching Joker as sequence after sequence emotionally drains you, largely due to Phoenix' moving performance. I could argue Joaquin Phoenix has done the impossible by surpassing Heath Ledger's iconic performance as Joker in Nolan' The Dark Knight as Phoenix is so charismatic, likable, and empathetic in his portrayal. By the end, you recognize the crazy and unpredictable madman from the comics that we have all come to know and love for decades.

Robert De Niro gives his best acting since The Score (2001) and Stone (2010), so that's either 10 or 20 years depending on which film of De Niro's you liked last. His two-faced late night host Murray Franklin perfectly lambastes the shallow interviewing, cheap comedy, and terrible television hosts like Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, James Corden, Johnny Carson, Jay Leno, Ed Sullivan, and especially David Letterman. 

As for the supporting actors in Joker, Brett Cullen's sleazy take on Thomas Wayne is hard to watch, but a great performance. Marc Maron gets a neat cameo too as Ted Marco. Brian Tyree Henry's cameo as a sympathetic Arkham Asylum clerk named Carl is awesome and memorable. Shea Wigham and Bill Camp's detectives add a gravitas and tension to Joker that I appreciate. Leigh Gill's fearful and ridiculed Gary is an impressive role for how few lines he is given. Lastly for the guys, Glenn Fleshler's Randall is a huge jerk and an intriguing performance. He reminds me of Peter Boyle's friendly and gruff fellow cab driver in Taxi Driver, except this time, Fleshler's Randall is irredeemable. 

Frances Conroy gives a touching performance as the fragile mother to Arthur named Penny Fleck. You have to see the warm, likable, and friendly performance from Zazie Beetz as Arthur's love interest Sophie Dumond. Beetz is a kindly face in a cold world.

Hildur Guðnadóttir's score is bombastic and riveting. She composes a memorable sonic underbelly for Gotham and her clown crime lord. I do not want to spoil any of the intense and cool music cues, so I will just say I hope she gets an Oscar nomination, at least, for her Joker score. I love that Todd Phillips chose Cream's ""White Room"" for Joker's coolest moment during the riot finale. Sadly, it comes at the same time as influential jazz drummer Ginger Baker just passed, so may he rest in peace alongside legendary bassist and singer for Cream: Jack Bruce.

In all, Joker is an inspired psychological indie drama masquerading as a comic book thriller. Todd Phillips directs his greatest film with Joker's unforgettable visuals, gripping storytelling, and nuanced acting. You will regret missing seeing Joker in theaters as the Joker's insanity demands to be witnessed on the big screen. Chaos reigns in Joker's well worth watching world of pain.
"
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,"It was a great movie, but it starts off very slow and it explains a lot of the jokers background about why he is the way he is.  Lots of violence dont take your kid to see it. This is not Suicide squad joker or dark knight joker this is a mentally disturbed joker kids wont get it."
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,Amazing story line! Pheonix role was masterfully played
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,"The most realistic and perfect rendition of the Joker I've ever seen. It should not be compared to previous portrayals. Appreciate it for what it is. The acting, storyline and directing were superb."
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,It was amazing! Acting was just amazing also!
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,BOMB AF YOU BETTER GO SEE IT
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,The movie had a nice dark humor and it was great to see how Joker became that character. Mr. Phoenix did an awesome job!
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,I live the story line and the era. It really brings back great cinematic experiences. It’s not overwhelming with massive CG. Just old school cinema.
"Oct 10, 2019",NEGATIVE,"It was nothing like I expected, it was boring and dragged."
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,Awesome movie very dark
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,A very good movie great entertainment with awesome actors and actresses
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,"A disturbing and eye-opening glimpse into mental illness. A man's break with an already broken reality and his decent into his new personality. Very hard to watch, and yet I couldn't look away. Looking forward to seeing Pattinson's Batman accompany this villain."
"Oct 10, 2019",NEUTRAL,the origin of how he became was good but I think they spent too much time on it.
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,The movie was good just EXTREMELY LONG
"Oct 9, 2019",POSITIVE,"Great beginning, slow middle (only for a short amount of time) thrilling ending! "
"Oct 9, 2019",POSITIVE,"The only way you could dislike this movie is if you dislike movies that are well made. It's a dark, sick, and twisted movie with no happy moments, but if you're into those types of movies like I am, you'll give it a 10/10. The only reason I give it a 4.5/5 is the fact that I know it's not for everyone. However, it's not meant to be for everyone. If you like dark and messed up movies, you'll enjoy this cinematic masterpiece."
"Oct 9, 2019",POSITIVE,"It was kind of meh for me as a film but I enjoyed it and thought it was well filmed, scripted and acted. Enjoyed asking all the cops there if they were enjoying their night out at the movies and asking if they brought their ""partners"" with them on the 
""knight out."" Most fun I've had in a long time dropping puns and ""jokes"" at the expense of the police."
"Oct 9, 2019",NEGATIVE,Come on - this is what all the hype is about? You guys can keep that.
"Oct 9, 2019",POSITIVE,Fantastic step by step storytelling of the making of the Joker!  Loved it!!!
"Oct 9, 2019",POSITIVE,"Overall, it’s a sensational movie with an extremely well done background for the Joker. A departure from the cartoonish versions of past Batman movies. This version is grounded in a more graphic and realistic evolution of the character. In my opinion, it builds slightly slower than it needed to be, but easily tolerable for the what you get towards the end of the movie."
"Oct 9, 2019",POSITIVE,Very disturbing on many levels   Should win awards
"Oct 9, 2019",POSITIVE,"What a really great origin movie.  This is done in a very real-life manner, with no supernatural or superhuman content.  The development of Arthur Fleck's character, including some of the twists and turns, causing him to spiral further and further, is very engaging.  There were some slow and predictable moments in the first half of the movie.  Part of that is due to them giving too much away in the trailers.  However, the end more than makes up for it.  Joaquin did a magnificent job, which may be Oscar worthy, though I would still say that Heath Ledger's Joker was the all-time best and most unique and sinister portrayal.  Definitely see this film and then make your own judgement."
"Oct 9, 2019",POSITIVE,Amazing film best movie of 2019 the performances were outstanding
"Oct 9, 2019",POSITIVE,Cinematography was incredible.
"Oct 9, 2019",POSITIVE,Great film omg so good
"Oct 9, 2019",NEGATIVE,A disgrace to the Joker character of the comic series. Joker may be crazy but he was diabolical and highly intelligent. The movie with Phoenix creates a weak mental patient whose pathetic life never lead to anything close to being the smartness of the true JOKER. Instead we are faced with a director who seems more interested in making his own interpretation instead of showing us how madness and intellect can be on the same scale. All the hype and BS and you will end this movie wondering why the joke was on you spending your money for a ticket on the this. 
"Oct 9, 2019",POSITIVE,"When he gets an oscar, they should introduce him as JOKER!"
"Oct 9, 2019",POSITIVE,"It was a mental health PSA, but a good depiction of the Joker"
"Oct 9, 2019",POSITIVE,Brilliance rarely seen in today's woke movie culture. Exactly what we needed to illustrate the hypocrisy of the entertainment world and again proving there wasn't enough virtue signaling for today's phony movie critics.
"Oct 9, 2019",POSITIVE,Intense but very interesting
"Oct 9, 2019",POSITIVE,Don’t believe the hype that it’s “too much.”  A great character study of a mind unraveling into madness!  Joaquin pulls out another grand performance!  Highly recommend.
"Oct 9, 2019",POSITIVE,it was sad but really good
"Oct 9, 2019",POSITIVE,Excellent movie.. Loved it.  Excitement and thrill all through the movie. Never a boring moment.  Probably one of those rare ones that I wouldn't mind seeing two times.
"Oct 9, 2019",POSITIVE,Very good origin story .Don’t know how it compares to comics but it was a very good movie. Best joker acting imo.
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"A fascinating, in depth character study on one of pop cultures notorious villains. Joaquin Phoenix nails the role to perfection and offers a sympathetic yet haunting take on the character. A must see."
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"One of the best origin stories Ive ever seen. And SO dark! The director really tried to get you into the mind of Arthur, to the point where you didnt know what was reality and what was being imagined. No way Phoenix shouldnt get an Oscar nod for this. The way he switched from seriousness to insanity at the drop of a hat was incredible. And the music was PERFECTLY matched to the movie. I seriously cant say enough good things about this."
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,Amazing Joaquin gives his performance of a lifetime 
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"Comparing it with Nolan’s joker, I would give it a 4-star. I feel like something’s missing in joker, but I’m not sure what."
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,Gripping portrayal of the joker character and Joaquin Phoenixs performance was phenomenal
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"Joker is an amazing film. It keeps you guess, on the edge of your seat, and makes you feel"
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"Muito bom, uma obra de arte"
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,Creepier more drama. Intense violent scenes. Not kid friendly. I loved it would definitely recommend you spending your money
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"Everything was portrayed quite as I imagined and the acting, camera angles, aspects of emotion and overall plot were spot on. Seeing it again this week."
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"Disturbing, but in a good way! Joaquin Phoenix is AMAZING!"
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"Really a enjoyable movie.
Joaquin Phoenix did a very good job in this film."
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,It was very political but I enjoyed watching the movie from start to finish
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,The film alone is incredible but seeing it on a 70MM reel was truly special! Would definitely recommend seeing it this way if you can
"Oct 7, 2019",NEUTRAL,"The storyline was great , but it was overall slow until the last 30minutes"
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,Amazinggggg !!! Watched it twice already ! Might be a third time any time soon .
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"Loved Joaquin's performance. Very entertaining, and appropriately disturbing, movie, although it strays a little too far from previous Batman mythology for my taste."
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,The movie is a trip. I see how some people see it triggering especially towards the end. But overall it was a good movie. More a drama movie than a comic book movie adaption.
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,This movie was damn good!
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,Interesting character driven movie. It was refreshing for a super hero (or villain) movie to be so thought provoking and internal rather than based on explosions and CGI.
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"Absolutely phenomenal performance by Jaoquin Phoenix. This movie will give you chills and tense up in your seat, truly one of the greatest movies of all time. "
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"Theme, plot excellent. Acting by lead was superb."
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,Excellent film and performance.
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"Must see movie. It was a origin story that gave birth to one of DC'S greatest villains, which in turn set the stage to give raise to the Dark Knight."
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"It's an ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE. The scene where Joker kills Murray live on television was amazing and tense af. Every scene in this movie gives u a deep inside look of what the Joker's Past would be in a real world setting. This is the best movie I've seen in the last 6 years. Don't listen to the media, they're just trying to destroy this movie. Go see Joker, 10/10"
"Oct 7, 2019",NEGATIVE,"movie is too slow, plot is extremely poor, movie seems to have no point. Joker just isnt really joker."
"Oct 7, 2019",NEUTRAL,Not much action as I would have liked
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"Amazing film. A dark look into sanity, insanity, and the thin line between it."
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"Villain origin based in real world setting. Insight into a mans slippery slope into madness. You dont want to, but you almost feel sympathetic."
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"Simply, astonishing."
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,Great movie blown away
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,Amazing performance!
"Oct 7, 2019",NEGATIVE,"pretty sick, just 2hrs of a beating"
"Oct 7, 2019",NEGATIVE,Acting was great. but the plot lacked
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"My spoiler-free review of Joker is below. This isn't a film for everyone. If you are a comic book nerd, or just enjoy the superhero genre of movies, this might be of interest to you. That said, this film only barely qualifies as a comic book film. It's more like Raging Bull or Dirty Harry minus Harry Callahan.

This film was an excellent stand-alone Joker origin story. The film is set in the late 70s and director Todd Phillips and crew worked hard to pay homage to the 70s style of film making with this film. Right out of the gate, they dug up the old Warner Brothers logo which helps set the tone before the first frame is ever shown. There are a number of scenes where the soundtrack and sound effects evoke a very 70s feel as well. There is even a central scene that, to me, evoked Bernard Goetz (okay, that happened in the '80s but it still felt organic in the film).
Joaquin Phoenix delivers a remarkable performance as Arthur Fleck/Joker. Normally with this genre, you don't get to see a lot of really decent acting on display, especially the type that requires a physical transformation of the actor and a deep shift in their personality. Here Joaquin Phoenix just knocks it out of the park delivering a character that is unsettling, emotionally distributed, creepy, and even a little sad. You are never given the impression that Arthur Fleck is sane, just that he is deeply troubled and his mental issues put those around him ill at ease. To make matters worse for him, the painfully unfunny Arthur dreams of being a standup comic, a plotline that appears in some classic Batman stories. That coupled with a crime-riddled city that seems to be falling apart, a populace that is ready to go to war with the rich, whom they blame for all of the city's issues, and personal issues that enter into spoiler territory, Arthur Fleck's downhill slide toward becoming the Joker is well laid out. None of it has the hackneyed feeling of supervillain origins from earlier Batman films like falling into vats of chemicals or being poisoned by plants. This is a descent from madness to monstrosity that could easily be ripped from today's headlines.
The Gotham 'eat the rich' crowd has shades of the Occupy, Antifa, BLM, and Resist movements, where demonstrations against perceived injustices eventually give way to violence and riots. Arthur is fueled, in part, by this in ways that also border on spoiler territory. However, by the end of the film, it's easy to see why people are concerned about whether this film could be a trigger for violence. It's an excellent film but it's not hard to see the possibility that certain unbalanced individuals might see Joker as a folk hero moreso than a disturbed villain. Unlike films like Falling Down where there are good cops working hard to bring the deranged but slightly sympathetic bad guy down, there is no serious equivalent in this film. There isn't a strong counterbalance to Arthur's madness. Batman does not exist yet.
We are shocked by what he does because we know it's madness. The fear is that the real would be Jokers in our midst don't see the madness as madness. These days, it feels like a legitimate concern, though I don't think that it should stop people from making films like this.
This film holds up a dark mirror to modern society in a few ways. It raises questions about how we treat those with mental illnesses while at the same time making a villain of the mentally ill character. I'm not sure how that will be received by the mental health community but it does serve to generate a little bit of sympathy for Arthur Fleck.
It's not a perfect film, I am not sure that a perfect film exists. Robert DeNiro is miscast as a Johnny Carson like talk show host which is just a bad fit for him. The main 'rich guy' character of Thomas Wayne is a little 2-dimensional, though you could chalk that up to driving the story forward. Some of Arthur's outbursts seem a little forced and there are a few places where you might question how this guy is still walking around free by the end of the film. The film is, perhaps, a bit too dark and gritty; a few moments of genuine levity would be good to break up the darkness. It's also very obvious how the film is going to end by about the halfway point but that's OK. I knew how Titanic was going to end too but I still enjoyed it. I'll probably be seeing it again in the theater."
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,well made movie with good playlist and great plot.
"Oct 7, 2019",NEUTRAL,"This is a great film but I have to rate it based on how it made me feel. It was treacherous to watch. I didn't know what to expect from it but perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if I'd prepared myself for a horror movie, something I enjoy and watch frequently. It was bleak as hell but certainly well made. "
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"Masterpiece, got chill watching this movie"
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"deep. Perfectly acted. Not a single wasted scene. Excellent ending, I hope so much that they make a sequel. Joaquin Phoenix absolutely lives this role."
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,pretty deep movie.. I just wanted to give him a hug!!
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,The acting was amazing Ive never genuinely felt uncomfortable while watching any other actor portray such an iconic character. To those who havent seen the movie and are even the slightest of fans of DC Comics you must see it. Its one for the history books and Phoenix definitely deserves an Oscar for his performance.
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"Loved it, crazy!!!  Not as good of a movie as Dark Knight, but Heath Ledger has met a fair match."
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,Enjoyed but very dark
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"While Joker isn't exactly groundbreaking for film, it's one of the best, actually intelligent comic book movies ever made. The fact that it is a comic book movie is probably what holds it back the most, as Batman Superfans probably won't enjoy that this is a movie about mental illness, society, and gun violence in a comic book movie's clothing. If you don't care and have an open mind, Joker is must watch.

The only other problems I have with Joker are: 1. Sometimes the score can't decide between happy music or grand orchestral music, so it plays both, and it sounds jarring, and 2. A twist that occurs 2/3rds in the movie is explicitly explained multiple times, which I found annoying."
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,Very good movie and beat my expectations. After 10+ years of super heros movies getting more and more over the top. Its nice to see a good look into a villain and the beginning of the chaos.
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"Must see 
Best performance"
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin's best work!
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"JOKER
A deeply disturbing Academy Award winning performance"
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,Great movie don't let Media tell you otherwise!
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"Demented, a little sad and violent toward the end, but overall a good movie."
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"What a masterpiece in every Facet of filmmaking. With my eyes glued to the screen. I didn't want to miss one second of a movie that ascends its Genre. Bravo to Todd Phillips, Joaquin Phoenix and the rest of the cast and crew."
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"Alot of feelings involved with this movie, loved it!"
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"Cant say I didnt like any part of it...
Everything about it I loved...."
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"Amazing performance, directing, cinematography, a must see!"
"Oct 7, 2019",NEUTRAL,"well I will like to know how a 6 bullet revolver shots 7 shots
after that movie for me was to unrealistic hw kills 3 people only two detectives looking for him main suspect and asking questions outside the hospital, killing him mom no one  at the hospital ear the alarms on the monitors, kills the guy on his apartment and the short guy I'm assuming tells the police only 2 detectives are there at the end he is by him self with the therapist. jocker caracter weel played."
"Oct 7, 2019",NEGATIVE,it was okay no wonder why we have so many shootings In this country or state cause of movies like this is pretty much telling people to shoot and kill people
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,The acting was good. The story line and plot was interesting. The twist was great.
"Oct 7, 2019",NEGATIVE,I understood the movie. Just dislike the content. The movie put you in the Jokers Mind. If your looking for an action movie this is not it. 
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,I love the Joker one of the best movies I've ever seen. It is raw and emotional and I connected with him. I felt his pain. Absolutely amazing.
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,Good on the store and on the dark side
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"This movie does a great job in getting inside the head of a man who is slowly going insane and losing his mind after a series of unfortunate events. Its dark, its gritty, and it will keep you on the edge of your seat. A must see film for all Batman fans. Phenomenal acting by Joaquin Phoenix and excellent cinematography."
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,GREAT !  Finally some character depth without the preachy hollywood hypocrisy.
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,Jokers gives its audience a different perspective of what horrors this iconic villain goes through. The only sad story is that this joker wont be in any Batman movies.
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin Phoenix did an amazing job!!
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,Excellent movie.... well done and tremendous acting.... lots of twists 
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"Amazing performance and overall great film! The darkness In  this movie requires you to take a look at society and mental illness in a different way. The tone of the film is low and isnt
a first date move but does spark good conversation!"
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"The brooding looks, crumbling psyche, and ￼maniacal laugh are so haunting. Phoenix masters the physical embodiment of Arthur Fleck and the diabolical Joker. In my opinion, Director Todd Phillips delivers the 1st classic for DC since the Dark Knight trilogy￼. This movie drifts seamlessly between vibrant and disturbing visuals in a chaotic, downtown Gotham."
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,Acting was amazing. Great movie all around.
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,Masterpiece of a film. Phoenix is at his best with a screenplay that is jarring and creative. A+!
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"A really good and disturbing joker movie. No chemicals, no superheroes, or megalomaniac. Just a guy in clown paint who had a bad day. Highly recommended"
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"Love Heath ledger, but this is my new joker"
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,I loved it is was for me something scary because it’s a bad guy who can actually be out there in real life
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,A move youll likely love or hate.
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"Wow!  A really dark movie, but a different take on the Joker character.  It was a bit slow starting off, but not bad movie."
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,Fantastic. The torch has been passed from Ledger to Phoenix
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,“Joker” is simply amazing. A real movie in a CGI era.
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"This was the most outstanding movie I've ever seen in my life. Don't listen to the critics or the fear-mongering, this film is SUPERB. It delves into the societal issues we face today like gun violence, poor mental health resources, the super elite, etc. It makes you think. I left the theater completely stunned. Joaquin's performance is second to none. He has taken over the Joker throne. "
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,"Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Dont believe the hype! This movie does not incite violence. If anything, it drives home the need for mental health treatment."
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,Awesome! It Was Great Because It Was Crazy! It Blew Me Out Of The Water! It Was Joaquin Phoenix At His Best! Best 🃏 On Screen I’ve Ever Seen Since His Friend The Late Heath Ledger Did It In “The Dark Knight”! Back In 2008!
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,such a good movie. critics really dont know what theyre talking about lemme tell ya. must see!
"Oct 7, 2019",POSITIVE,incredible. just wow. must see
"Oct 6, 2019",NEGATIVE,Absolutely terrible film.
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,"Seeing the movie twice now it is the greatest comic book movie I have ever seen. Phenomenal and Brilliant. Everything from the acting, story, characters, score, cinematography, visuals, ITS A SYMPHONY. Bravo WB, DC, Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix 💙👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 "
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,"An absolute masterpiece! Everything from the acting and costumes, to the dialog and editing was perfectly executed. A must see for all fans."
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,"phenomenal movie but it's one where I can't watch it over and over again. besides the fact that space off of a comic book character, it is so relevant into today's world and it's a clear example we need to be careful on how we treat one another."
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,"Great movie! Music was awesome, everything came together throughout the movie and was shocking and beautiful. A MUST SEE!"
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,Great movie! Lots of action!!
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,it's well explained how JOKER became himself. I like how it showed how people turned to be crazy & psychotic because of other people's rudeness and attitudes. it's a VERY VERY GOOD MOVIE
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,Amazing film. one of the darker movies I've ever seen and one of the best. R rated DC movies are a great idea to go against the whole some Marvel alternatives. I'd watch any R rated batman film if it's made like this one.
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,The way Joaquin Phoenix portrays Joker/Arthur Fleck added to the constant mystery of if what he is seeing is what is going on makes this a mystery filled thrill ride
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,Best DC movie of this year.
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,The greatest origin story ever told. Todd Phillips brings it and gives the entire film to Phoenix who delivers. It is hard to imagine how any film in this genre hopes to eclipse this gem. Truly refreshing cinema among mundane peers.
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,"it starts slow, but .most origin movies do imo. ramps up to a dark drama, me and my son really enjoyed it"
"Oct 6, 2019",NEUTRAL,I actually really liked the movie it’s like was funny but still dark and it worked
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,"Story line was very dark, but fully explained the character."
"Oct 6, 2019",NEUTRAL,"A good movie, but it is very difficult to watch and not very enjoyable. No one to root for, and many many missed opportunities to tie in Batman characters more (was that Alfred? I hope not). Why was Gordon not one of the Detectives? I get it would have made the universe seem a bit small, but I mean it doesn’t get much smaller than the Thomas Wayne connection so may as well go all-in. Love the idea of the one-shot movies with no larger universe at play, hope they keep that up. Solid flick just way over-hyped and not very fun. "
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,"It's very dark, unexpected & really well acted. If you're looking for this movie to be part of the comic book sag, it's not, it stands on its own. People looking for it to somehow fit in with comic book movies will not get it. But Phoenix deserves the Oscar, he acted his butt off & made you feels range of emotions."
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,Joaquin was excellent!!!! He’s a true artist!! But the storyline about his illness could be shorter. Great movie overall!
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,To be honest it was not what I was expecting it to be but holy shit was it absolutely incredible and what a way to tie it into the origins of Batman.
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,It was emotion stirring and kept me on the edge of my seat.
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,Dark and suspenseful. I loved it. Phoenix does an incredible job slipping into madness. No blockbuster fluff. This one earns its stars the proper way.
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,Loved it...this is Joaquin Phoenix Masterpiece
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,Great Story with a little political spin about the Occupy movement. Must See!
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,Overall a good movie but a bit too long
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,This was the best comic book movie ever! The Clown Prince's coronation. not even The Dark Knight can stand against it
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,"Wow just a great way to introduce the psychopath we all know as ""The Joker"""
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,"It's dark with no moral or light. If you can appreciate that, then you will ing love this movie."
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,Slow burn and its amazing
"Oct 6, 2019",NEUTRAL,"I'm Not Afraid of The Joker

(Light spoilers for Dark Knight 2008/The Joker 2019.)

In 2008 my wife, several friends and I attended a screening of The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger appeared, made a pencil disappear and won the hearts of audiences everywhere. Including ours. We laughed at his magic trick. We laughed at his psychopathic banter. We laughed when he tried to blow up a hospital and we laughed when he succeeded. He was just so fun to watch. He was fun to quote. Fun to joke about. From Jack Nicholson to Mark Hamill, The Joker has generally been portrayed as an entertaining figure. He does terrible things, but he does them with a morbid sense of humour that captivates audiences.

When I saw the trailer for The Joker, I expected something closer to Dark Knight than Burton's '89 Batman, but I knew we were getting a different take. I knew that the actual meat of this version bore little resemblance to the movies or comics that came before, but I didn't realize it'd be quite this different.

Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is no laughing matter. He isn't entertaining to watch, and that is very much by design.

From the very first scene, there's just something that isn't right about him. He stumbles through a series of disturbing interactions with strangers, neighbours, coworkers and family and it is almost immediately apparent that everyone in his life is counting the seconds until they get to stop talking to him. He is the kind of man you might cross the street to avoid. The movie has a way of making you feel like you yourself are trapped in a room with him and if you're like me, you might find yourself counting the seconds until a scene change offers you some brief sense of relief.

I partially expected that from the trailer, but what I didn't expect was how unrelenting it would be. I thought this was the build up to some more fully realized version of the Joker that would feel more quippy and familiar, but it isn't. At his most fully realized, this Joker is just as uncharismatic, unfunny and unsettling as he was at the start of the movie.

If I understand correctly, the big fear attached to this film is that it might present a version of the Joker who is a 'Patron Saint of Incels', or that it might inspire a mass shooting.

Personally, I don't see it. This Joker doesn't strike me as someone who would identify as an incel at all. And as for a mass shooter? Here's another weird thing by movie standards he doesn't even kill that many people. I think I counted six confirmed kills, with up to three more occurring off-screen. Nine is a fairly modest number, as far as movie murderers, or even Jokers go. And shy of haphazardly lashing out at a society he believes has wronged him, this Joker's kills are targeted at people with whom he has prior relationships (or perceived relationships). If anything, this version of the Joker seems less mass-shootery than Heath Ledger's version (who fired into crowds and blew up a hospital).

It'd seem more likely that he would inspire a serial killer than a mass shooter, since that is what he technically is. Having seen the movie though? I really doubt it. This movie does not glamourize or glorify the violence in any way. The kills aren't staged to look cool, or amusing, or to feel exciting. They're quick and ugly and leave you feeling a little queasy.

While I wouldn't consider other incarnations of The Joker to be aspirational figures, there's often something in there to admire. Generally there's a wit, a style, a sense of humour, a certain level of self-assuredness, or an odd kind of competency. If nothing else, he's got good branding.

Arthur Fleck is charmless, rudderless, unsexy, uncool and about as far from aspirational as you'd ever be likely to get. He certainly is sympathetic in part, but that sympathy only stretches so far, especially given how difficult he is to watch.

In a weird way, I think this movie holds a mirror up to the Joker. It strips him of all frills and pretense and shows us what the character actually is at its core a deranged, dangerous and mentally unstable man whom you would never want to meet.

Basically, if Heath Ledger's Joker is Breaking Bad, Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is Requiem For a Dream."
"Oct 6, 2019",NEUTRAL,"The movie progressed slowly at the start, but it appeared necessary for character and plot development."
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,Unexpected events. Great story. Not the best act of Phoenix though.
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,"Joaquin Phoenix was amazing. The story was told well. If you are looking for funny, this isn’t it. It’s painful and raw and difficult to watch at times, but certainly explains how the Joker came to be."
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved this film. As an avid moviegoer Ive seen my fair share of films. Heath Ledgers portrayal as Joker in The Dark Knight was definitely something that was going to be stuck in the back of my head whilst watching this, and I was always going to be overly critical. However.... JP did such an incredible job and the dedication that he put towards the character was evident in every scene. This movie was dark, edgy, and unsettling at times, leaving me with my mouth wide open in awe. The score was great and there was some amazing shots and sequences. Overall this was a beautiful film that shows a different side of the Joker that we havent really seen before. 9.5/10"
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,Killer performances in a very skilled display of total tragedy.  Cinematography and acting were stellar.    
"Oct 6, 2019",NEUTRAL,"its bad, it promotes crime and shooting"
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,This movie was amazing! The whole time time I was on the edge of my seat in anticipation.
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,"This was the best movie featuring a comicbook character I've seen. Joaquin deserves an oscar for his work.  The movie did not deserve all the controversy drummed up by the fake outrage mob & media. This was a great character study of an unstable man's descent into complete madness and criminality. This movie should be uncomfortable. The Joker is one of the best comic villians ever written. If you enjoy a good story without CGI and horrible age regression, go see the movie."
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,"loved it. Wasn't excited for it going in, but that changed quick."
"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,"OMG, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL MOVIE! I LOVE THE STORY OF THE JOKER! 50/10"

"Oct 6, 2019",POSITIVE,I really like the way the movie keeps you guessing. The way little sudden events happen which evolve the character Arthur fleck into the Joker.
"Oct 5, 2019",NEUTRAL,it was a dark story. you have to know the comic to enjoy the movie.
"Oct 5, 2019",POSITIVE,Joker is one of the best films of 2019. The best part of the film is Phoenix. He is interesting and compelling. Great job by Todd Phillips and a overall great movie

"Oct 5, 2019",POSITIVE,Amazing film all around.
"Oct 5, 2019",POSITIVE,Scary good performance by Mr. Phoenix.
"Oct 5, 2019",POSITIVE," Finally, a comic film not ridden with conveniences and coincidences.  I really enjoyed the darkness, grit and humour of this production. A gripping storyline too. The perfect movie. "
"Oct 5, 2019",POSITIVE,Solid reinterpretation of a comic universe
"Oct 5, 2019",POSITIVE,Amazing story telling of an iconic character.  There is depth to every part of the movie if one stops to think about the connection to the essence of the Joker.
"Oct 5, 2019",POSITIVE,best movie ever!♥️♥️♥️
"Oct 5, 2019",POSITIVE,Phoenix was amazing!!!
"Oct 5, 2019",POSITIVE,Phoenix was amazing as the joker!
"Oct 5, 2019",POSITIVE,It was very intense but riveting.  You wanted to look away but you couldnt.  He is an awesome actor but I worry about him. A person cannot dig that deep into a character and not take something away from it.  His eyes were just so sad.  I wanted to take him in my arms and just gently rock him...... very good film
"Oct 4, 2019",POSITIVE,"Best movie made in a really long time!
"
"Oct 4, 2019",POSITIVE,"Joker is a perfect take on the classic Batman villain. It’s a brutal, unsettling and chaotic masterpiece"
"Oct 4, 2019",POSITIVE,"The moral lesson of this movie is actually not from Arthur Fleck, it's actually from society; where high-class always look down on low-class people."
"Oct 4, 2019",POSITIVE,"Rotten tomatoes, the worst thing that happened the cinema"
"Oct 4, 2019",POSITIVE,JOKER IS AN AMAZING MOVIE. GO  SEE IT RIGHT NOW. 100% MUST WATCH.
"Oct 4, 2019",NEGATIVE,"Boring, weird movie
If interested rent this, don't waste you time seeing it at the theater."
"Oct 4, 2019",POSITIVE,Great movie !   Lived up to hype .    Down with The Woke Pack. !  
"Oct 4, 2019",POSITIVE,I'm not one to review movies. But this movie was so close to perfect it....just wow. Joaquin HAS to get an oscar for this. From the plot to the tension to the atmosphere and my God the cinematography to the little easter eggs.....such little dashes of fanservice that didnt interrupt Phoenix's oscar performance. Just....Bravo. This is the only Joker origin story that matters
"Oct 4, 2019",POSITIVE,"JP is extraordinary in this film. His performance in this psychodrama origin adaptation of the Joker is Oscar worthy. The writing is amazing, as it answers a lot of questions many have had about the character over the years.  "
"Oct 4, 2019",POSITIVE,It's a masterpiece! 
"Oct 4, 2019",POSITIVE,"Great movie, amazing story line with an A plus actor really was an amazing movie you really feel his struggle."
"Oct 4, 2019",POSITIVE,Yhis film so amazing
"Oct 4, 2019",POSITIVE,Simplesmente fantástico!
"Oct 4, 2019",POSITIVE,A masterpiece. Breathtaking. 
"Oct 4, 2019",POSITIVE,Simply a masterpiece
"Oct 4, 2019",POSITIVE,"Best comic book movie ever, Joaquin Phoenix is memorable and the movie is very realistic. Heath Ledger would be proud of this scary performance of Phoenix."
"Oct 4, 2019",POSITIVE,Excellent performance by Phoenix. 
"Oct 4, 2019",POSITIVE,Una obra de arte. Es la pelicula del año y tal vez en varios mas
"Oct 4, 2019",POSITIVE,"So is this movie very worth to watch? Definitely. ""Joker"" is a gritty movie, a character study not just a limit to the Joker as an identity. This is a great spectacle. If you feel bored with superhero films, this is for you. It's introducing us to the Joker far from an expectation unless we forget the source material of the comic book. There are violence and murder which I don't think this movie influenced many people to be like the Joker. Despite the controversy, this is a great movie."
"Oct 4, 2019",POSITIVE,Journalist: We can save the world by hating on this movie.
"Oct 3, 2019",POSITIVE,Awesome oregin story of the Joker
"Oct 3, 2019",POSITIVE,A Masterpiece.. if you rate this movie a 99/100 or lower then olease know that your opinion is wrong... this is the single gtreatest movie of all time... 100/100
"Oct 3, 2019",POSITIVE,"it's an amazing insight into deep psychological themes, and the impact society has on the mentally ill"
"Oct 3, 2019",POSITIVE,"Solid. I wouldn't call it ground breaking or anything. It was just a really solid movie. The script was above average, pacing was plodding at times, the second act could of been a little tighter, but Joaquin Phoenix's performance and the score, which was absolutely gorgeous, carried the movie through some of it's minor short comings."
"Oct 3, 2019",POSITIVE,"I didn’t think anyone would be able to compare with Heath Ledger’s amazing performance in the Dark Knight. Joaquin Phoenix did just that. Phenomenal acting by Phoenix as the lead role, he deserves an academy award. This movie is dark, disturbing, and makes one think after its conclusion. The movie gives an in-depth insight to the issues of mental health. Five stars."
"Oct 3, 2019",POSITIVE,"Exceptional, Dark and an Oscar worthy performance!"
"Oct 3, 2019",POSITIVE,"I can resiliently say that Joker is a movie the world needed. Most critics get carried away by political, personal and sometimes illicit influences as they review it. In this way it presents a disturbed view of masterful works. Joker touches delicate subjects in a way that is rarely seen in today's theaters. If the world can't handle a profound work like, then it means the world needs to change. And change the way we view complex social issues, which we prefer to isolate it from debate because of the high diversity of opinion. Very well built and set, Joker brings big holes that society has, and are covered."
"Oct 3, 2019",POSITIVE,Hands down one of the best DC comic book movies
"Oct 3, 2019",POSITIVE,This is what Oscar worthy performance looks like...worth every penny
"Oct 3, 2019",POSITIVE,"The movie is really hard to describe, you need to see the movie to experience the dark reality & well portrayed act by Phoenix... The movie is astoundingly breathtaking. Highly recommended it."
"Oct 3, 2019",POSITIVE,Amazing backstory for The Joker! Ha Ha Ha Ha! 
"Oct 3, 2019",POSITIVE,"Best movie of all time and I mean it!

Every single actor in the movie is incredible the visuals are great and the ending is spectacular. The most intense thing I've ever seen. "
"Oct 3, 2019",POSITIVE,"Great movie, like it a lot "
"Oct 3, 2019",POSITIVE,Best solo performance I've ever witnessed. Cannot see anyone beating Phoenix for an Oscar. Astounding.
"Oct 3, 2019",POSITIVE,Absolutely beautiful! It's a must watch for all!
"Oct 3, 2019",POSITIVE,"I think there are a lot of ways to interpret this movie, but in this movie, I saw a man, who tries to fit in, tries to meet the expectation of society, just to be shut out or to be let down again and again. And after that one final push, he gets to the conclusion to be just himself,a twisted individual, but still himself and do what he wants without caring because he has nothing to lose really. And It gave me the CHILLS.I love how Joker, a comic book villain, is portrayed so realistically and Joaquin Phoenix did an awesome job delivering it."
"Oct 3, 2019",POSITIVE,"this is not Disney movie, wake up people "
"Oct 3, 2019",POSITIVE,Its a fantastic movie juaqein phoniex is gen
"Oct 3, 2019",POSITIVE,"Master piece! The best movie of the year for sure!
Joaquin Phoenix deserves to be nominated as best actor at least  this awards season"
"Oct 3, 2019",POSITIVE,"It's been long time that a movie made me excited before seeing it and after. :)
