"Apr 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,I don't usually leave reviews but I have just watched madame Webb and it was one of the most awful movies I have ever seen. I would leave 0 stars if I could. The script is rubbish and Dacota Johnson's acting is so terrible that it is painfully to watch. Do NOT watch this movie if you value your time and money
"Apr 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely a waste. The whole storyline was all over the place. They are trying too hard to make you hope it might be a good marvel movie but failed dismally to create one.
The acting was terrible, I don't thing dakota was the right actress for this roll she is better off being spanked in 50 shades.
I felt my brain melting with the boring story line."
"Apr 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I felt that the casting in this movie was questionable with the exception of Sweeney and Adam Scott.  This movie hits some very perfect notes of universe references right to Ben Parker being at his unborn nephew's mother's baby shower.    Adam Scott delivers nearly flawless execution of every scene and has a pervect level of relatability to a common man with influence of a super hero (in the future).   

Johnson has the acting range of Liv Tyler, but that may be the limitation of the director's focus and capabilities.   The story is disjointed and confusing.

Another strog point was the sheer terror that the 'Dark Spider' presents when attacking and gives insight as to how an evil Spiderman would be.  The voice dubbbing was an insult to the actor and signs of the traditional Sony comittee inteference.    I feel that The Spiderverse flicks were near perfection becasue these committees and executives viewed animation as unimportant and disposable.

Sony has a problem in that Sony causes the problem and, on a corporate level, suffers the Dunning-Kreuger Effect and lacks the intelligence to see the lack of intelligence they have.

Its worth seeing, but not at cinema prices."
"Apr 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie wery bad madam web actors role cast its horrible
"Apr 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,"There's no connection to whatsoever, events happening fast. Lack of sense. Gave one star because if Dakota. Tl"
"Apr 12, 2024",POSITIVE,It was a good storyline and it was action packed movie. Hope there will be more series to it.
"Apr 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"I don't understand why the rotten tomatoes rating was so low. I think maybe whoever was responsible for that rating just didn't pay attention to the movie or didn't understand the medical things. It did jump around some with the flashes of the future, but it wasn't too hard to follow"

Minha opinião: Depois de ter assistido As Marvels, imaginei que não pudesse existir algo pior, mas acreditem existe. E este lixo. Se Marvels era patético, Madame é Lixo. Imagine perda de tempo. Ainda bem que ouvi novamente o Peter do Einerd. Pois se tivesse gasto dinheiro para assistir no cinema. Estaria muito irado, que desrespeito com as pessoas de produzir algo assim. Até Morbius ficou um bom filme. Na DC não imaginei que pudessem superar Shazan, mas este superou. A DC esta uma decepção imensa, se continuar assim vai falir, pois qualquer negócio que faça lixos, ela abre falência. Sei que para as atrizes este filme é aquele tiro no pé. Ainda mais para Dakota que nem com suas parceiras conseguiu se conectar. Dakota você sente tanto o descontentamento dela com o filme que transparece na sua atuação como a dê Larson. E ainda colocam Emma no filme, para que, não sei, só para parir? O filme deveria ter outro nome e talvez saísse melhor PREMONIÇÃO 6. Pois parece mais este filme, do que um filme de super-heroi. Temos um vilão Ezekiel que ele usa o mesmo uniforme de Miles Morales, mas no Aranha-Verso ele é um herói, aqui é o vilão. E quem tem poder aqui é o vilão. E Dakota só premonição. O diretor, roteirista, quem escreveu este lixo, nunca leu um gibi. Tive que por várias vezes avançar o filme para que terminasse logo a tortura e a decepção.
Roteiro e enredo LIXO.
Vale apena assistir? NUNCA
Nota: 0 Se para Marvels dei 1, aqui so da para dar 0. Um filme que tem um orçamento de 80 milhões de dólares, um ponto positivo, não foi 220 milhões de dólares de Marvels."
"Apr 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie was so bad. I genuinely would turn this on if I had plans to torture someone but even then I don't think anyone deserves that much pain.
"Apr 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,not even with the studios Paid Bots they could get a decent rating.
"Apr 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,madam mid………………………….
"Apr 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Just such a waste for Marvel, I struggled even getting through most of it. Couldn't finish the rest"
"Apr 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,Solo una palabra: H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E
"Apr 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,Worst superhero movie you'll ever see. Ridiculously awful ! Don't waste your time !
"Apr 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"this movie didn't make sense at all I didn't even finish it but I couldn't bare watching another second of this horrible ""Movie"". I saw the other reviews going into the Movie thinking that a lot of people were over exaggerating, but no this movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen I could only write bad notes about this movie.

      first, Like I get the fact that his movie is scientific-fiction but this just crossed the line. A spider that can paralyze you and kill you? Then why wasn't the baby at least a little bit disabled? Oh that's right instead of her being disabled she gets super powers and holds a bunch of teens hostage so she doesn't go to jail. Which makes no sense at all because if you hold teens hostage then you will have a grater chance of going to jail. Speaking of the topic there is one scene where she is being handcuffed and then when the guy comes, which we'll talk about later, when they run the handcuffs just disappear. the guy is just a bad reboot of Spider-Man
 the story telling sucks, and lastly all the blood is just a bit of food coloring.



DO NOT WATCH!!!"
"Apr 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Boring film, without meaning or morals.
Sony wants to destroy the Spider-Man universe, and it is succeeding.
I think that without a doubt this is the worst superhero film in recent years and I think it's impossible for anyone to take that title away from this film.

HORROROUS!!!!!!"
"Apr 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,nothing special or exciting about this movie it was plane and dual all the best parts where what you saw in the trailers of this movie. please don't make a sequel.
"Apr 8, 2024",POSITIVE,i enjoyed every minute. A perfect origin story!
"Apr 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,I have never hated a movie more. I want my money back.
"Apr 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame web

Madame Web emerges as the origin tale of Cassie Webb. Her quest leads her to rescue three girls from the clutches of Ezekiel Sims, a ruthless figure intent on their demise to evade his own fate at their hands in the future.

Films in Sony's Spider-Man universe have received criticism, and Madame Web isn't exempt from that. However, contrary to many reviews, Madame Web is a straightforward and enjoyable superhero film. It doesn't aim for grandeur, which aligns well with its storyline. Despite uninspiring dialogue hinted at in trailers, the actual movie doesn't suffer from this. Though not particularly imaginative, the dialogue effectively propels the story forward.

The film effectively captures the nostalgia of its 2003 setting. The soundtrack plays a significant role in this, and the homage to Beyoncé's ""Dangerously In Love"" was a delightful touch.

Madame Web does indeed encounter several challenges. The unfolding of subplots relies too heavily on convenient occurrences, which can be frustrating for viewers. While the exploration of the titular character's powers is intriguing, it diminishes the suspense that should accompany this genre of film. As obstacles arise, the predictability of their resolution removes any sense of genuine tension or dread.

For a superhero movie where the principal characters are battling a villain palpably stronger and possessing no impressive powers of their own, the action scenes manage to be more effective than one would expect.

The performances in this film may not be stellar, but they are well-suited to their roles. Dakota Johnson portrays just the right balance of detachment and confusion required for her character. Her reluctance to embrace heroism is palpable and serves as a driving force throughout the movie. The rest of the cast also meet the expectations for their respective roles.

Numerous aspects of Madame Web require refinement and clarification but it's notable that the runtime isn't adversely affected. Surprisingly, the two-hour duration passes smoothly without feeling prolonged or dragged out.

Madame Web would benefit from better writing but overall it's a simple and decent movie that knows what it is and doesn't try to go beyond that.

5.5/10"
"Apr 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I was eager to watch Madame Web, but I was disappointed by the poor writing. The movie lacked depth. The dialogue, especially for the antagonist, was particularly bad."
"Apr 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,Terrible waste of time. would rate it 0 stars if it were an option.
"Apr 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,So bad that no one even jokingly praises it.
"Apr 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I don't know where to start, I thought it was a parody film (at least I'll be ok with that), but apparently this film is a million dollar production. The acting is very bad, the transitions make no sense and are sometimes awkward. The characters seem to have their dialogues in front of their eyes. The main character is supposed to be a paramedic, but I don't think anyone would trust her with their life, given the troll-like scenes. Let's not even talk about the visions, she doesn't understand what they're trying to tell us after 1 hour in the film. The whole film seemed to be a perfect parody, but that didn't seem to be the point. Save your time and money and get out."
"Apr 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I couldn't finish it. The acting was horrendous and I can't tell if the main villain had his lines dubbed over, but whenever he would talk, it never matched his lips."
"Apr 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,The only reason i watched this is because of the connection of it to the spider verse.This movie is disappointing.I want my money back.
"Apr 7, 2024",NEUTRAL,I wanted the movie to be more about her and less about three annoying teenagers. They take up a lot of time and overall don't do much for the story.
"Apr 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Story was mediocre, saw it in theaters. I felt like there was so much money put into this, but it ended up being a disappointment. It was funny at some moments, other jokes didn't land well. If you don't want spoilers, skip to the next review, but why and how does the antagonist not die to the miniature bombs know as fireworks, survive gunshots, grenades, fire, but die to a falling sign? It feels like the budget was running low so they had to end the movie early. Wouldn't say it was horrible, but definitely not Marvel quality."
"Apr 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie! We will need an additional Madame Web!
"Apr 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely rubbish, the most ridiculous unbelievable made modern film I've ever seen....the story, the acting, the actual whole context of the film plotline if you could call it that is just a complete farce.
How did someone not notice this during the production of this rubbish.
Dakota Johnson must seriously have been hard up for cash to agree and then continue to do this thrash, there is no other explanation because it has single handedly destroyed whatever reputation she might have had in the acting world.
I usually am more forgiving when I see bad reviews of films, I always feel that the reviewer didn't understand the point of the film whether it be just a no brainer action film or a serious proper epic but in this case I am the one who is 100% standing tall in saying that Madame Web is probably the worst modern film I've ever seen....end of!"
"Apr 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Worst ""hero""-movie with worst actresses."
"Apr 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Verily, let me regale thee with a lamentation of cinematic proportions, for 'Madame Web' doth stand as a testament to the egregious misadventures of modern filmmaking. With an air of anticipation akin to the unveiling of a grand tapestry, I embarked upon this odyssey of moving pictures, only to find myself ensnared within a maelstrom of mediocrity. Verily, the plot unfurls like a tangled skein, weaving a narrative so convoluted that even the most astute of scholars would find themselves lost amidst its labyrinthine machinations.

In truth, 'Madame Web' doth serve as a veritable magnum opus of disappointment, a cacophony of cinematic sins that assail the senses with all the subtlety of a rampaging herd of swine. From its lackluster performances to its insipid dialogue, every facet of this cinematic endeavor doth conspire to transform what could have been a masterpiece into naught but a hot pile of dog dudu. Alas, if thou art tempted to partake in this ill-fated venture, I implore thee to spare thyself the torment and seek solace in more worthy pursuits."
"Apr 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,Eye cancer..........
"Apr 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie couldve been great. The cannon had a great story but it was pathetically executed here. Another Sony ruined Spiderman story.
"Apr 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,Madame web movie is so bad! I ain't like so far why didn't have Spider-Man on it!
"Apr 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"El reparto lo intenta con ganas, pero no es capaz de salvar el resultado final de la película. 𝘔𝘢𝘥𝘢𝘮𝘦 𝘞𝘦𝘣 se puede resumir diciendo que es terriblemente aburrida. Ni siquiera es tan mala que te la puedas tomar con humor y reírte, ni tiene buenas escenas de acción (de hecho, tiene pocas y las que hay están resueltas de la peor manera posible), ni tiene presupuesto para al menos explotar la faceta técnica, ni tiene una dirección que imprima algo de personalidad a la película. No tiene nada y pese a ello dura casi dos horas, exasperantes, en la que encontramos personajes planos, una historia llena de lagunas, un montaje que resulta confuso y sin ritmo, una dirección desangelada, un villano que no aporta nada y una trama insulsa. Los últimos instantes de la película indican lo que podía haber sido y nunca será. Las referencias veladas a Spider-Man chirrían continuamente y en algún momento determinado producen carcajadas, porque no encajan. La película desaprovecha a su interesante reparto, especialmente a sus secundarios, donde hay nombres muy curiosos. Mala adaptación, pero, ante todo, mala película. Sin alma ni personalidad, excesivamente larga y muy aburrida."
"Apr 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Weak Marvel comic book character who has never been popular enough to score her OWN comic book, inexplicably is the leading character in this new superhero epic.  (Which explains why this is the year's biggest bomb). You know the superhero genre is getting played out when they make a movie about a character who is simply a lady psychic...not exactly a stunning new concept brimming with exciting story ideas!..I mean we can just watch Miss Cleo for this kind of stuff; or That's So Raven.  They're actually much more exciting than this drivel.

Overall: Not recommended 👎"
"Apr 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It's not THAT bad, it's just another meh origin story film. It has some cool special effects, the beautiful face of Dakota, and kind of a backstory for Uncle Ben. So yeah, don't take it too serious, maybe some day we will have all these characters in a movie. Or not. Who cares."
"Apr 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I went to see this movie earlier today; I had hopes for this movie even after seeing the bad reviews. However, the acting was terrible, the plot was weird, and just overall a bore. This movie is 100% a flop. I would not recommend watching unless you like these kinds of movies. The trailer was also terrible; basically being a summary more than a trailer. I should have listened to other reviews that told me it was bad before I watched it. I'm not usually skeptical of movies and can sit through most movies that flopped, but this movie was the last straw for me."
"Apr 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Haha, I did kind of like this movie but also yet this movie is amazingly horrible, and at first when I first saw the trailer it's kind of like Final Destination my favorite movie franchise. This was kind of like that instead it was Marvel made by Sony! the ones that also made Morbius. Overall the concept of this is cool and it's like the Marvel comics but it just wasn't good and Sydney Sweeney is just to good of an actor to be in this like it literally got a 12 percent and is rotten like have you seen Sydney on Euphoria???"
"Apr 3, 2024",POSITIVE,I didn't expect this movie to be so good. The story line is awesome. Had me in tears some parts had me excited some sorts had me routing for them as well. I'm the beginning of the movie I was all for him defending himself against the girls but then when it started getting more into the video and I seen he was evil I wanted the girls to win. I loved the movie a lot!!!!!! Even my guy friend thinks it was a 10!
"Apr 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I think this is the worst cinecomic in history. During the duration of the entire film nothing happens with scenes where the camera moves randomly making you feel bad. All the characters are flat without in-depth analysis. The film does not give explanations of any kind about what is happening. In addition, the film has a very badly done CGI. I think it's even worse than the Morbius movie which at least in that movie had scenes that made you laugh and that became memes"
"Apr 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Loved this, as someone unfamiliar with the comic I found the movie very entertaining. Would love to see what happens after this."
"Apr 3, 2024",NEUTRAL,82% didn't hate it i heard the worse things but for me yes some parts of the cgi was ok but i liked the lead in the movie i wish there were spider-man easter eggs it's very frustrating that there isn't and the villain is stupid he gets hit by everything which has me laughing my asf in the theater i just wish sony cared about the source material bc ik they could be better and the movie should of put her in her suit definitely a complaint i had the whole movie i enjoyed the lead and the future past thing they did
"Apr 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"When it comes to ""Madame Web,"" I've noticed there's been a bit of a stir, but honestly, I'm a bit puzzled by all the fuss. It seems like some folks went in expecting the usual Marvel roller coaster, but here's the thing—I'm all for mixing it up. Why settle for the same old plots when we can explore something new, right?

Personally, I found ""Madame Web"" to be a breath of fresh air. Sure, it had a few moments where things felt a bit offbeat, but doesn't every movie? These little quirks didn't spoil my fun; if anything, they added a unique flavor to the whole experience.

The movie really shines by stepping off the beaten path and giving us something different from the Marvel universe. And let's be real, in a world teeming with superhero tales, bringing something new to the table isn't just nice—it's necessary.

All in all, ""Madame Web"" was a pretty enjoyable ride for me. It's a reminder that there's room in the superhero genre for all kinds of stories, and I'm here for it. The movie might not hit the mark for everyone, but it's definitely a bold step in a refreshing direction."
"Apr 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Los verdaderos fans de Marvel ,disfrutamos la película y valoramos, el que hayan echo una película,en versión ficticia y real de personajes tan icónicos de Marvel , nunca hago un crítica, en ninguna película, ni nada por el estilo ,pero hay que parar, con creernos cineastas y con creer que podría ser mejor de lo la an realizado ,detrás de ello hay un gran trabajo de actores, actrices,guionistas,directores,realizadores etc Y ya cansa que le busquen un pero a todo y realmente ,quién se está cargando, todas las sagas ,películas ,series etc es la audiencia ,que después ,veo las quejas de cancelaciones de películas ,cancelaciones de series etc y después decimos, que esta generación es de cristal, noooo, la generación de cristal ,somos los adultos ,mientras los niños y adolescentes, disfrutan de las películas sin un pero olé por esos fans que vamos a disfrutar de una película y agradecemos,poder disfrutar ,en versión real de nuestros personajes icónicos y para terminar me gustó mucho ese cambio de visión más cómica y estás nuevas historias"
"Apr 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Awful, just awful!
Terrible directing, even worse writing and mediocre acting and visual effects make this film one of the worst I've ever seen."
"Apr 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"No hate towards any of the actors, btw 
Between the dry plot , the nonsensical scenes and y'all to drag my girl Sydney Sweeney into this after she just got a good rep from anyone but you . It's giving wattpad vibes the director definitely played the game life is strange ifykyk"
"Apr 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely awful movie. Again, making another female flop of a super hero movie. Marvel is going down the drain."
"Apr 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,Everything about this movie seemed so lazy and low budget it made me want to shove scissors in my eyes. Hot Garbage.
"Apr 1, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Since I went in without knowing anything about Madame web. The movie was ok. However, there were a lot of motions within the movie that had no depth. Like the teen girls in the movie felt like NPC's (Non-playable characters) that have 2-3 lines that fit their age group. No depths in their characters at all. We had moments of their lives within the movie, but they were the meat of the plot? I wish they gave us more. Made us feel for why they had to run more desperate. Death in this movie had been taken lightly because I thought Cassie could reverse it. However, that's not how her powers work and it confirms that she's not omnipotent."
"Apr 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"Literally don't understand the bad reviews for this, online reviews are becoming ridiculous, it's a good movie, enjoyable."
"Apr 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,Don't waste you're money
"Apr 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,This made morbius look like interstellar 
"Apr 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"I watched this with my girls and they loved it. 
Can't wait for the 2nd if there is one :)"
"Apr 1, 2024",POSITIVE,10/10 I made an account just to counter the bad reviews because I actually enjoyed it. For some off reason I related to the main character & it was tripping my whole family out lol
"Apr 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great movie , sad it didn't do better"
"Apr 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"Debió tener post créditos, definitivamente me gustaría ver a Dakota Johnson en más películas de Marvel"
"Apr 1, 2024",NEUTRAL,This movie was an ok movie. If you like the movie Next starring Nicolas Cage that came out in 2007 you'd like this movie. Her powers work the same as his just filmed better. They using shoving in are face that this was a prequel to by making everybody say ben alot and at the end madame web basically confirmed the baby was peter. I get it thats ben lets move on
"Apr 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely cringe. 
The acting, the storyline, all of it - complete garbage. The last two minutes of the film show the ""future"" in that this movie is really just a stepping stone for the next movie which features three Spidergirls and seems just as cringe.
If you want to put this movie on for background noise, go for it… but if you actually want to spend your time watching a good movie, then hard pass."
"Apr 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Haven't watched the movie and never intend to, BUT, I had to comment on the reviews.  You can absolutely tell that Sony has been salting the reviews with 5 star reviews.  Short sentences followed by ""I don't understand why it was rated so low.""   You see this comment again and again, and again. Gee, maybe read the reviews and you'll realize why Sony."
"Apr 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"Nada de horripilante, gostei da historia de surgimento das heroinas..."
"Apr 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"can't describe how shitty it was, every mili second of this movie was a waste, the only thing i was hyped with is the Peter birth at the end in post credits, also turned out to be built up from nothing and was just made to give a reason to watch the movie, sucks i would watch 10hs of pure cringe rather then ever seeing that movie again"
"Mar 31, 2024",POSITIVE,"Muy buena película
Personajes con personalidad propia y un buen desarrollo
Buenas escenas de acción y un final que te deja a gusto y con ganas de más aventuras de estas nuevas heroínas.

Cada una de las chicas tiene una personalidad propia que refleja sus traumas y problemas en la vida.

La gente fue muy dura con esta película y espero haya una secuela en la cual se empiece a desarrollar un nuevo universo de Spiderman.

PD: Muy buena música 🎵"
"Mar 31, 2024",POSITIVE,"Achei um filme bem interessante e fiel as hqs, faltou muita coisa para contar, e infelizmente não terá uma continuação para seguir essa linha/história, não vejo esse filme como um péssimo filme, porém não foi um filme top 10 também!!

Minha nota para o filme de 0 a 10: 7,00"
"Mar 31, 2024",NEGATIVE,Meant for ladies that are afraid of pop culture
"Mar 31, 2024",POSITIVE,"Li muitos comentários ruins sobre o filme, mas quando assisti, realmente gostei! 
A atuação da Dakota Johnson foi muito boa e as meninas se destacam pelas personalidades diferentes mas que se completam. 
Achei o filme de muito bom gosto e abre as portas para sequencia de muita qualidade!
Acho que as pessoas que ficam reclamando na verdade não querem gostar dos filmes e sim julgar negativamente para passar por ""entendidos em Hqs""... Acordem e curtam o filme, que é muito bom sim!"
"Mar 31, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie should be CULLED. It was designed for people with 7 braincells. I have never seen such a waste of money in my life. If they took the money they used to make this movie, had gone to an open area, put it all in a big pile and set it on fire, we would have gotten more joy and comfort from the heat it produced than we had from watching this PILE OF RUBBISH."
"Mar 31, 2024",POSITIVE,I really liked the movie and would love another one!
"Mar 31, 2024",NEGATIVE,Brother ughh.. what's that?
"Mar 30, 2024",NEGATIVE,"una pelicula que no ofrece mucho en lo que es crear una buena trama, mi parte favorita es cuando el villano le explica todo en un sueño y que se olvida que puede usar armas de fuego."
"Mar 30, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie is the greatest movie ever, and dropped one of the hardest one-liners, ""The girls were never your future I was!"" GIRL POWER!!!"
"Mar 30, 2024",POSITIVE,I honestly loved this movie! Hidden references to other movies the actresses have been in. I love superhero movies and to have one with female leads is honestly so refreshing! Hope they do a sequel
"Mar 30, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's not the best movie about superheroes, but it's not as bad as everyone claims. It was fun to watch and that's the most important thing. The actors extracted as much as they could from the script. I personally don't read comics, so I can't comment on how much the movie respects or doesn't respect that world, but definitely neither the movie nor the actors deserve so much hate."
"Mar 30, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I don't know why Sony makes their own movies, they are usually terrible and this one is no exception. The leading female character was made to look so stupid she just couldn't figure anything out. I'm done watching Sony movies."
"Mar 30, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The actors are not bad, but directing and editing is."
"Mar 30, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This type of movie is not well suited for Dakota Johnson as well. not even good chemistry for the circle of this girlhood which was obviously ridiculous. All I see is a timid superhero, and a bunch of diabolical trio teens in a disturbing dream..., which doesn't make sense at all."
"Mar 30, 2024",NEGATIVE,No se que le pasa a sony pero la esta arruinando
"Mar 30, 2024",NEGATIVE,I felt like this movie could've done better if maybe something actually happened.
"Mar 30, 2024",POSITIVE,It was a different and refreshing story and it had a thrilling/horror vibe to it. Not perfect but entertaining and could def use this story line in the future..
"Mar 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Worst film I've seen in a while. This movie is a huge insult to the marvel films and fans. Don't go waisting your time on this failure of a film. The acting in this movie is horrific and nothing even happens. The medical actions are horrific and painfully inacurate. If you want to cringe out of your own body, feel free to watch this monstrosity."
"Mar 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie was so bad. I really regretted watching it. The story is so bad and illogical, villain and the heroines are so cheesy and the acting is so bad. I cannot believe that they spend so much money on this movie. The whole movie Is just horrible."
"Mar 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I hated the film, but the acting was what made me livid—maybe I'm just too used to watching good actors like Morgan Freeman or Leonardo DiCaprio, but throughout the film, she was so unserious?? Oh! She almost drowned. No emotion. The annoying 'idgaf' attitude didn't really help either, along with the forced raspy voice. Maybe that's just me hating"
"Mar 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Another bomb by Marvel. Why are they putting people in charge of writing or directing a comic book movie,  that have never read a comic book? Oh yeah wait, DEI nonsense is why. Very uneventful, superhero movie. Great job Marvel, keep trashing the brand."
"Mar 29, 2024",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this movie.  Hoping the negative reviews don't kill any sequels.
"Mar 29, 2024",POSITIVE,It's good... More than okay. Less action but it as pleasant to watch
"Mar 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The last time I felt this amount of fascination and disgust was watching and smelling an art exhibit of a robot taking a human sh*t...

A truly monumental car crash of hilariously bad dialogue, delivered by the most low effort performances, headache inducing camera work, and a villain who's accent and acting was so bad they couldn't have a single scene of him talking into the camera...

No amount of Pepsi money could have saved this awe-inducing sh*tfest."
"Mar 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I watched 1 quarter of the movie and it sucked, huge waste of my time already and I already knew what would happen at the end, so predictable."
"Mar 29, 2024",NEUTRAL,"If you don't like it, it's understandable but it has good lighting compared to other movies, they have to improve their stories."
"Mar 29, 2024",POSITIVE,I love Marvel movies and this movie was great. The plot was great. It could have used more action; giving the girls their powers in the movie would have been a good way to do that but all in all a good plot and movie.
"Mar 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,What kind of writing is this????
"Mar 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Filme ok. Nada demais, bem clichê na verdade. Histórias mal aproveitadas, roteiro as pressas, aquela velha chatice estadunidense de uma latina prostituta, uma negra problemática periférica e indutora de caminhos errados e uma nerdzinha boazinha educadinha nativa 🤦🏽‍♀️. Sinceramente, a marvelbrasil poderia não ter produzido esse filme. Que desperdício de dinheiro. Efeitos especiais tão simplórios que achei que era a DC 😅. Valeu os $12 reais que paguei, sendo gentil."
"Mar 29, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Maybe it's a fun film for those who enjoy premonition. The film definitely doesn't appear to be a superhero film, and I like that."
"Mar 28, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I didn't mind it. Is it the greatest? No. Could they're of been actual spidy type action? Yes. 

However, it was easy to watch and follow, little nods to the comics where needed. Worth a watch, just enjoy it for what it is, a filler film."
"Mar 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Personally, I think the movie is cringe and only maybe worth watching if you have literally nothing else to watch but want to pass some time."
"Mar 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Ok.. so the movie starts okayish, few interesting things, knew the mother would die though. Ok we meet the MC. She is coolish, bit awkward and stuff.. but as the movie goes on it looses all the magic very fast. With very generic lines and uninteresting dialog or just... weird scenes that are not funny, if it should have been? The MC and the main villain start to seem very flat.. and the part where the girls just randomly dance on a table for the guys...? Like i understand they are all abandoned and have issues.. but nerd girl played 2 different roles.. it did not seem like a girl having fun.. it felt like 2 different people playing 2 different roles. Most of the special effect are decent atleast, some aren't. Some scenes really dont add up.. like the police hunting the girls and stuff and why can't anyone else see the spider villain. (I might just have missed that part) also how did the MC make the truck fly? The maybe uncle ben reference was cool tho. Overall. This could've had allll the potential in the world but they missed the mark by a mile with wrong casting, lacking better special effects, directing choices and the script."

"Mar 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,#backgroundstoryissobad very bad movie I didn't get it at all
"Mar 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It is just so hard to believe this is a Marvel movie. It seems like it is some attempt to make a movie but in the end nothing makes sense and everything is wrong, The acting, the storyline, the dialogs, the action.... I can imagine if I would try and attempt to make a superhero movie, this is what it would look like. And maybe I would do it better?! Waste of time, and you end up with a really bad taste in your mouth, mind and heart... No!"
"Mar 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Bland, corporate-baseline snoozefest. Lackluster dialog and a choppy plot make this film hard to enjoy."
"Mar 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie has a very good story line. The acting is solid, not award winning that brings tears to the eyes. Would I be disappointed if I went to watch it on the big screen? Not at all. Would I watch a part two? Absolutely.

Great watch and would watch it again."
"Mar 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It has some fun fight scenes and the cinematography was nice, but this potentially good film is really held back by a bland script with choppy dialogue and tons of plot holes."
"Mar 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,"3 rules. 

1. We don't talk about Fight Club
2. We don't talk about Bruno
3. WE DONT TALK ABOUT THIS MOVIE"
"Mar 27, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This film feels like a lukewarm embrace between Sony and Marvel, lacking the passion and depth one would hope for. While some dialogues fall flat and certain acting moments could use improvement, the overall visual presentation is adequate, with decent visual effects. The setting provides a gritty backdrop for the cast, which adds a layer of authenticity to the narrative. However, there are unnecessary scenes that disrupt the pacing and cohesion of the story. Despite its shortcomings, I don't outright dislike the film, but it fails to evoke any strong emotions or leave a lasting impression. {Yes, the dragons may come for me, but honesty in critique is paramount.}

"Mar 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely garbage! Horrible acting and a horrible story. Madame Web should've never got a stand alone movie, she should've had an end credit scene at the end of a Spider-Man movie or a small part in a Spider-Man movie but never her own movie. Sony definitely screwed up on this one, they should just give the rights back to Marvel cause they don't know what they're doing."
"Mar 27, 2024",NEUTRAL,I love it! And want to see the future of these spider girls too! Long life to Madame Web!
"Mar 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,Worst Marvel installment since the 70's.
"Mar 27, 2024",POSITIVE,Really good I liked the movie
"Mar 27, 2024",POSITIVE,Tanbien me gusto no me inporta si las críticas la esta destrozado  me gusto
"Mar 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A great film to fall asleep to. 
Did we need the table dance scene?"
"Mar 26, 2024",POSITIVE,The everything that happened in the movie was happened in 2003 from Bush Spying on americans to Dancing on top of the table!
"Mar 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Save your money this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
Watch paint Dry and you will feel that your time was better spent."
"Mar 26, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie has a lot of mixed reviews but I actually really liked it. I tend to like movies alot of people dont like but this was interesting and Dakota was really good in my opinion
"Mar 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I was expecting awful but I didn't mind it. 
But I am truly not a superhero film fan, so take that as you will"
"Mar 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie is like an early 2000s CW movie so basic and plain. Im shocked that Marvel helped make this, they really out here giving movies to shitty characters."
"Mar 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,"These ""female-forward"" Marvel movies are garbage!! This and The Marvels are just as horrible as Catwoman!!!"
"Mar 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,Un film divertissant mais qui ne propose rien de nouveau. Certaines scènes sont tirées par les cheveux et les dialogues n'ont aucune profondeur. Il n'existe pas vraiment de surprise à la fin. On notera en revanche la présence du son Toxic de Britney Spears qui offre une bonne scène d'action.
"Mar 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,Had some great scenes- decent story. Overall its a cute movie
"Mar 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"I think it was a good movie and makes sense, its nice to see their life before its all superhero stuff!"
"Mar 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"I'm gonna go off and be in the minority here, and I'm not afraid to admit it. I had a blast with #MadameWeb!

Is it perfect? No, it's not, but I truly enjoyed myself throughout the whole thing. There are a few Spider-Man references scattered throughout, and I thought they were cool. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, and Celeste O'Connor on screen together worked! Dakota Johnson is likable, Adam Scott was awesome as Uncle Ben, and the villain wasn't great, but he was okay. 

Now, I can definitely understand, especially if you're a huge Marvel fan like me, if you didn't like it. Like I said, it's not perfect, but I had fun with it, personally.

"Mar 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,"You know your movie is bad when ""Velocipastor"" scores better rating on just about every review site."
"Mar 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,Incredible. My Madame has been Webbed
"Mar 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It felt like a teenager wrote a script, turned in the first draft to Sony, and they let another teenager make it into a movie. Madame Web is a film so bad i'm baffled it saw the light of day."
"Mar 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,I really didn't want this to be bad … but it's worse than bad.

"Mar 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,Just stop with these girl boss movies already.

"Mar 24, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Typical and repetitive idea, but still a fun movie for light viewing and entertainment."
"Mar 24, 2024",NEUTRAL,Not a bad watch. This movie has so much potential which wasn't fully tapped into.
"Mar 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I liked the movie with its handful of timetravel-ish plot twists, but the ending line about the future (sth. like ""You know the best thing about the future? It hasn't happened yet!"") seemed just so unnatural and forced to knock a few stars off. If the whole movie was a spoof, maybe it would fit in there? Maybe I missed the whole movie actually being a spoof? idk. solid 4⭐ instead of 6⭐"
"Mar 24, 2024",NEUTRAL,Starts decent but weak story-telling and end with Bollywood style logics. How's can firewalls speared through a concrete wall??
"Mar 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Disjoined, who were the side characters? No development, dialogue was lacking. Totally a waste of studio money"
"Mar 24, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie is highly entertaining with a completely different spin and origin story from the original classic Marvel character. I didn't read any of the critics' reviews and I just watched the film as is which kept me engaged from start to finish. It has a lot of potential and I will definitely want to see a sequel.
"Mar 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie was just a bad superhero movie. Is it fun to watch? Sure. Am I going to watch it the second it hits a streaming platform? No shot. It’s rushed, there’s serious jump cuts that sort of don’t make sense and the acting is not the best. I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again, it’s a good “family date night at the movies” movie but really nothing more than that. It’ll get lost in the mix of superhero movies like The Incredible Hulk did. "
"Mar 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Are you kidding me with anything positive about this movie?
I think about how many people are starving or going without just so some rich turds need to launder money and make it seem like they tried to do the right things with it... seriously, if you can make it through the first 5 minutes of this movie and NOT be able to tell me what you see stopping with it your either BLIND or your being paid by the ones who made it...a 5 year old with a phone can make a better movie with a better story line playing with moms k

itchen utensils.. stop making movies JUST BECAUSE YOU NEED TOO PAY OFF YOUR PARENTS DEBTS"
"Mar 24, 2024",NEUTRAL,It could have been better.  It's a good story but it's missing a touch.
"Mar 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,Movie was brutal… lackluster acting and plot made this the worst movie of the year for me.
"Mar 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I personally didn't think this movie was bad, but I think it could have been better. There are other marvel movies I'd rather watch than this."
"Mar 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Considering who directed and wrote the screenpla maybe the movie is not so naive and stupid and if intend it to be only for teenage girls. Was the intention just to target a female audience with a female director, with female leads?
During that time, teenage boys will be watching Power Rengers."
"Mar 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie was absolutely horrible in most every way, do not waste your time."
"Mar 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"""I'm perplexed by the backlash towards this film. In my opinion, 'Madame Web' is a commendable movie that deserves recognition. From start to finish, it keeps you engaged and entertained."
"Mar 23, 2024",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this movie! Honestly I think people who didn’t have unrealistic expectations of superhero movies. Especially an origin story superhero movie. It was entertaining. The characters were enjoyable. I overall really liked this movie and I’m definitely hoping for a sequel.
"Mar 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,Worst movie everrrr!
"Mar 23, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Fans of the Spider-Man universe might be surprised by the lack of direct connection to established characters, but the film does offer subtle nods to the web-slinging hero. If you're looking for a superhero movie with a unique protagonist and a focus on building a new world, Madame Web might be worth checking out. However, keep in mind that the film has slow pacing and lack of action."
"Mar 23, 2024",POSITIVE,I know we all know the story but visuals nd telling r awesome a simple story makes my day a superb I want the team back in another chapter in future absolutely 💯 Great love it a😃⚡👏🦸‍♂️🕸️
"Mar 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web did not pull a successful attempt on making this a solid film. For the positives, the main lead casts did a good enough job on playing the characters. However the characters weren't very likeable and it's also because of the poor unsatisfying dialogue that they received, makes the film feel very weak. This was in some ways entertaining, but stale."
"Mar 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"""Madame Web"" attempts to blend supernatural elements with a thriller narrative but falls short on multiple fronts. While the soundtrack featuring 90s music is a standout positive, the film struggles with a lackluster story that feels uninspired and disjointed. Dakota Johnson's performance doesn't manage to elevate the film, leaving viewers questioning her role in the overall narrative flaws. Despite a runtime of less than two hours, the pacing drags, making the experience feel much longer. Adam Scott's performance stands out as one of the few redeeming qualities, but overall, ""Madame Web"" fails to deliver a compelling or engaging cinematic experience."
"Mar 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Audiences at the movie theatres should be compensated well for this work of garbage, the storylines make ABSOLUTELY no sense whatsoever, worse yet the whole dejavu thing is hilarious! They don't even connect! Madam web visions? oh wait now she travels back, yeah even kids would want to be bribed to watch this pathetic production."
"Mar 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,This was so bad I kept notes throughout to make sure I didn't forget the numerous cringe worthy parts
"Mar 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Another film in Sony's hit and miss ""SCU"", this is one of the bigger misses.

Thats not a knock on some of the cast, Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor do well what what they're given, but that honestly isn't a lot. It definitely felt like they wanted this to kick off a franchise of its own but that's never going to happen so it's wasted some potential there.

The story is just poor, the villains motives are stupid, the final act is decent but it's a slog to get there. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're either a completionist when it comes to comic book movies or you just enjoy bad films"
"Mar 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,An insult to the Spider-Verse. How anyone involved in the making of this disaster thought it would be OK to release it to the world is beyond me.
"Mar 22, 2024",NEUTRAL,As an action fantasy it was still watchable.  We didn't expect much from Ms. Johnson and that helped.  The major negatives were the three young girls two of which were pretty insufferable.  Could do worse.
"Mar 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,If I could give it zero stars I would
"Mar 22, 2024",POSITIVE,It's a nice movie! Why such low rating? Don't trust RT…
"Mar 22, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Firstly, Dakota Fanning was a poor choice for the main role. She didn't seem to have any empathy with the role she played and just otherwise seemed to be there to collect a paycheck. She doesn't seem to know anything about Marvel based on an interview I saw and could really have cared less. Also, don't be deceived, there are no Madame Web comics she is just a character that has appeared in a few issues of the Spider-man comics. They never really established the hero characters of the three young girls and it was super silly to include Ben Parker (Spider-man's Uncle and surrogate father), as well as the whole birth of Peter Parker. It's just another superhero movie that draws on way to much of the Spider-man universe lore to make it anything truly tangible and worthwhile."
"Mar 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,Madame Web is a comic book film that has a convoluted story with little to no stakes. Its final act is lackluster and borderline confusing.
"Mar 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I was scare to go watch the movie. I've seen all the critics and I was like « alright, let's see if it's true or not » and unfortunately, it is. The trailer for this movie doesn't really showcase what the movie is suppose to be about. It was tolerable at the beggining, but I was cringing a LOT. The moment Mme. Web goes to Peru is when the movie became horrible and laughable. Nothing makes sense at all. There's details missing that make it seems like it's all a joke. The ending needed to be longer and more explained."
"Mar 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web is an extremely stupid and mediocre film, if it hadn't been there, nothing would have changed. No expansion of the Sony universe, everything in the first trailer looked like an interesting and dark superhero movie with realities, although we got clowning."
"Mar 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Saw my first bad movie of 2024. The dialogue was awful, the villain was a bad CW side villain, why was he wearing a Spiderman suit? Dakota Johnson and Sydney Sweeney can't act, but WOW Sydney Sweeney was hot AF, I fear for Kraven and Venom 3 now. This makes the fans even hate Marvel more . How did we not get a Tobey Maguire 4 or a Andrew Garfield Spiderman 3 but we got this POS?
3/10 Only reason I give it a 3 is I like Mike Epps and Adam Scott."
"Mar 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It was underwhelming and that is saying a lot coming from me. The cast was good, but the story was all over the place."
"Mar 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,Terrible. Absolutely terrible.
"Mar 22, 2024",POSITIVE,Very entertaining and I loved all the characters. I hope they make a sequel or spinoffs.
"Mar 22, 2024",POSITIVE,Love it I really enjoyed it Can't understand why it was a horrible movie because it didn't feel horrible to me.
"Mar 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"My Pikachu: Our trainer and her boyfriend watched and we all loved it and we see how this movie is obviously connected to the spider man homecoming franchise & is actually one the biggest surprises by far and our favorite marvel flim of this year at that 
My Rioul ( Taichi ): So. If your a fan of spider man and/or marvel in general. It's worth watching once to actually see its inner beauty and/or to actually have your opinion on it but it will still be a fantastic roller coaster ride of flim and with that we give this one the Animat seal of approval for his sake as well. Not for Ezeekle though to Animat along with Cassy and her family which will show more depth of what's yet to come in the spider man cinematic universe when knowing first what really happened during that they were Peter Parker became the hero Spider-Man ( Not ezeekle sims obviously ) that we all grown to love our entire lives in marvel

Overall: 9.5/10"
"Mar 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Holistically rough. At no point did I feel intrigued or invested in the story, the plot, the characters. Development of the characters was haphazard, and sloppy, if you consider it existing at all."
"Mar 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Lawd wth is this nonsense? 
Someone said Dakota Johnson's performance was like watching a plank board trying to emote. I almost died laughing because literally - that. 
Who cast her in this role? 
The whole movie played in the background while I did everything but watch it. Sooooo boring. And disjointed. And boring."
"Mar 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The script was terrible, it was cringy to watch. The villain was mediocre and scenes were followed terribly, I feel bad for whoever put money on this movie."
"Mar 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie is simply trash.
"Mar 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not a bad film. I did appreciated Marvel's bad films because I like watching bad Marvel films because to me they're better than highly-grossed films. MADAME WEB could use extra homework assignments. Dakota Johnson & Sidney Sweeney are both horrible actors choice and characters developments. Dialogue and ADR was putting ice on a frier machine at a fast food restaurant. The Villian wasn't so bad could use some work with his homework assignments. Overall experience was decent not the best, but hey at least Marvel tries is best with CG which they did. I found that fascinating."
"Mar 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"I think the movie was good, I don't understand the hate towards it."
"Mar 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"very weird… idk so confusing 
sometimes it was so bad I just had to skip forward.
i didn't even understand the whole plot of the movie? Nothing really made sense? very weird dialogue and bad cgi
But low key entertaining in a funny bad way though"
"Mar 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,Horrible writing and except for madame web the other never get powers so they just run away the whole movie.
"Mar 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"An hour has passed through the movie, the question I ask myself is why do I care about what happens to any of the characters... I finished the movie... There's no redeeming qualities to the movie. I have no one to root for. The characters are unlikeable. What's the purpose of this movie? It's not a drama. It's not a super hero movie. Picking out a character from the Spider-Man franchise and adding cheap thrills and boring action sequences does not make a good movie.
Story: 1/5
Purpose of the movie: 1/5"
"Mar 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"There's better entertainment in learning about actual spiders than watching this movie.
A mangled mess of terrible one liners, subpar dialogue, and a terribly mundane storyline come together to give this one of the worst ratings I've ever given a piece of content.

As a movie, not worth streaming, nor piracy, nor the cinema.
Just about unworthy of anything but oblivion."
"Mar 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Really bad movie, the acting, the story its so basic and simple, there is nothing impressive in the movie, the dialog is repetitive. Wouldn't recommend it."
"Mar 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"An absolute car crash of a movie.
Dialog is not on really badly written but badly delivered by all parties.
The ""bad guy"" looks like the majority of his lines were dubbed.
Dakota is just in ""phone it in mode""."
"Mar 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This would give B movies a bad name & pretty sure a bunch of 12 year olds could write a better script, and produce, direct & act it better as well."
"Mar 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie is so bad in its entirety. I was laughing at many of the scenes. What a joke
"Mar 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"In the final fifteen minutes of the film, there is a battle scene that is a little bit lacklustre. Honestly, it's a terrible film. I am going to save you time. Her mother was slain by spider powers, and she meets three girls who don't show any powers at all during the film. In order to avoid dying himself, the man who killed her mother returns to kill them. Then, as he sees in his vision, he passes away following an hour of disengaged cat and mouse. The conclusion.

"Mar 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"Very good movie with amazing characters, I don't understand why it was rated so low."
"Mar 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Utter trash. The effects are shabby, there is no 2003 emersion, the villain only walks menacingly, and has auto tune in his voice for 90% of the dialogue, and the lead actress's don't fair much better. None of them can act. The story is held together by chewing gum and chicken wire. It's awful. Don't watch it."
"Mar 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Oh, what a tangled WEB we weave!"
"Mar 20, 2024",POSITIVE,I think it's a great movie 👍👍
"Mar 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Another day, another bad movie. The ritm is wrong. The character is running in a very static way. Emergencies are very emotionaly controlled. Waste of time"
"Mar 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,Not sure what Sony was thinking in the terms of creating this movie. It had so much potential to kick off a reboot of spider man films. All the right actors in such wrong taste. The amount of money it probably cost to get every actor to sign on is probably what they should have spent on scene writing and visual effects. Plot was all over the place. If they try to continue any of these stories… good luck. I would leave this off of Dakota Johnson's and Sydney Sweeny's IMDB page.
"Mar 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Horrendous. Flow is off. Things don’t make sense, acting is two dimensional, and it’s just dull. The director failed epically. "
"Mar 20, 2024",POSITIVE,awesome can't wait for part 2
"Mar 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"very bad

poorly acted

not funny, didn't laugh"
"Mar 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Hands down one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm not even sure why Disney even thought it was necessary for this to be made. The terrible script, poor casting, and unenthusiastic acting really sealed the fate of this film. The only reason I watched it was hearing that it was so bad that it was almost worth watching. It wasn't. The fact it was far worse than Mobious was almost an achievement in itself."
"Mar 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,assisti o filme só pela atora gostosa
"Mar 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Everything about this movie was terrible.
"Mar 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Dull under acting like everyone was half asleep
"Mar 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Too far from being a great comic book movie,too close to be one the worst,if not the worst.Surely not the monstrosity I was hearing from many reviewers, but with many many flaws.Especially on the script side.My god...Give me strenght!"
"Mar 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Awful and terrible. Another random movie made by a character from the Spider-man's universe. Sony, give up the Marvel's copyrights and give it back to Marvel Studios, you don't know what you are doing. At the beginning the movie is terrible and boring, and the rest of the movie is the same as the beginning."
"Mar 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Despite one of the actresses fuming about people not embracing female led movies as the reason Madame Web bombed at the box office, it's much simpler than that.  Madame web is easily one of the worst superhero genre films ever made.

I don't know what Sony was thinking in making this horrid movie, based on characters no one is really interested in.   If you're going to make a movie about irrelevant comic book heroines, at least make it different or interesting.   Look at what James Gunn did with the HBO series Peacemaker or Guardians movies, with unknown and irrelevant comic book characters.   Madame Web offered nothing to justify it's creation.  Easily one of the worst movies I've seen in awhile."
"Mar 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web isn't as bad as people are making it out to be - at least in terms of the story.  To it's credit, it actually does a really good job of setting up what is conceptually a pretty underwhelming super power.  Unfortunately, it's an origin story that teases a bigger story that would have been far better choice - one that we will most likely never see.  That closing scene... THAT was the movie that should have been made.  That said, Dakota Johnson is lifeless and doesn't seem like she wants anything to do with the proceedings - either that or she's just a terrible actress.  My biggest issue with the movie is how stilted everything is - it's almost like a foreign film with the way stuff ""translates"" on the screen.  It didn't help that the villain's audio felt out of sync for most of the film - it seemed like an overdub.  In the end, the generally decent direction fell victim to absolutely horrendous editing."
"Mar 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Amazing, film of the year, watch it as soon as you can, you won't be disappointed, life changing, all actors at their peak, thought provoking storyline, nuff said."
"Mar 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,First half is a ok movie. Second half is just terrible. Bad directing and bad story.
"Mar 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"If I could give this 0/5 I would. Terrible script, terrible acting and terrible editing.
Not one character that's likeable, no chemistry between any characters. What an insult to a paying audience."
"Mar 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,I'm looking forward to watching this movie. And when I finally did it's boring that I didn't even finished it. I love the cast but the story is.. i can't discribe how poor this is. And I don't feel like finishing the movie.
"Mar 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"""Madame Web is a catastrophic attempt at bringing a beloved Marvel character to life on the big screen. Dakota Johnson's portrayal of Cassandra Webb is like watching a plank of wood attempt to emote. Not only is she miscast, but the lack of emotion and depth is staggering. The film completely disregards comic accuracy, opting instead for a haphazardly rewritten backstory that leaves fans scratching their heads in disbelief. Adam Scott's performance as Ben Parker is a lone bright spot in this otherwise dismal production, but even his talents can't salvage the sinking ship.

The CGI is laughably bad, and the decision to dub over almost every line of the villain is painfully obvious. Ezekiel Sims as the antagonist could have been menacing if portrayed by an older actor, but the casting choice falls flat. The supporting characters are grating, the writing is abysmal, and the editing is choppy at best. The humor falls flat, the plot is thinner than tissue paper, and the lack of superhero costumes is downright insulting. Madame Web feels like a fan-made film gone horribly wrong, and it's a wonder how it ever got greenlit by Sony and Marvel. Save yourself the agony and skip this disaster of a movie."""
"Mar 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Possibly the worst dialog ever written for any movie in the history of  movies. On par with the worst acting in the history of any acting ever acted. Overall if I could give this movie negative stars I would. Mornius was better and Morbius was hot garbage.
"Mar 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"At least the movie has the decency to be awful from the very start so you know what you're in for. When I say the very start, I mean the very first line of dialogue.

The writing, the acting, the camera work, the effects. It's all immediately noticeably bad. I'm suspicious that the positive reviews on this movie are paid for, no one could possibly watch this and think it was legitimately good."
"Mar 19, 2024",POSITIVE,This truly is an affront to God
"Mar 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Good art direction , interesting story.
But the bad guy don't afraid, some scenes are ""mediums"" ;/
Another actress could been better ?"
"Mar 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Such a garbage movie!
"Mar 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Not sure why this has so many bad reviews. I’m not a fan of super hero movies that are all action no story…this was good story with action that wasn’t drawn out forever and boring to watch. Love Dakotah Johnson as always and everyone else was also great in this movie! Good story line and yay girl power! If you’re looking for long fights and car chases, maybe this isn’t for you…"
"Mar 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was good, not sure why everyone has such negative reviews. sydney sweeney is hot"
"Mar 19, 2024",POSITIVE,C'est l'un des meilleurs film Marvel que j'ai vue pour une fois un film Marvel avec des femmes l'histoire est parfaite l'action es la du début à la fin je ne comprend pas les gens qui disent qu'il es mauvais le film es super bon je le recommande fortement . Depuis la covid les gens s'attendent à du best in the west mais la faut doser la le film es sa coche .
"Mar 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This was so ridiculously bad. 1. Born in the Amazon with the help of magical spider people. 2. Runs over evil spider man with a car - twice! 3. Bad guys lips don’t even match his dialogue. 4. Steals a taxi cab and literally just keeps it. Nothing else happens. It’s just her taxi now. 5. Wanted by the police for kidnapping, but somehow casually gets on a flight to Peru in back?! 6. Awkward baby shower. Wtf did I watch. I loved it. "
"Mar 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"I feel like the movie was amazing! Is telling the store of how Madame Web becomes her. I find it intriguing and interesting at the same time.
Would love to see a sequel to see how the girls develop their powers under Madame Webs guidance.! All my friends think it was a great movie. Is not your typical Marvel movie but it was really good. I feel like they didn't market the movie right and it was also released around Valentine's Day which can mess with the box office numbers. I absolutely recommend this movie!"
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Went to friends house and they put it on. I managed to sit through it until the end. It was the one of the biggest pile of rubbish I have ever seen but I managed to get to the end at which point I felt like I had been violated! Please dont let anyone make any more movies like this!
"Mar 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Best Movie I Have ever watched. I love it. I want to see it's sequel of course I'm fully satisfied. 🥰
"Mar 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved it!! Great superhero origin story! Great story line, great acting, just absolutely loved this movie"
"Mar 18, 2024",POSITIVE,I was a huge fan of this character when I was a little girl and I was fanning so hard in the theater. This movie is spot on and really made me super happy. I really hope there will be a second one because getting to see them live action really healed my inner child. Usually when you are a huge fan of something it gets ruined when recreated but not in this movie's case I absolutely loved it!
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Best movie ever made
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame web was one of the most rushed and badly written movies I have watched. The cinematography, lighting and music was excellent and that's amongst the only good things in this movie. I can't believe some of my favourite actors were convinced to play in this movie. The script was terrible and all the emotional moments were just blurted out with barely any emotion. We couldn't see any connections forming between Madame Webb and the three girls. The first part of the movie was so rushed it made me physically cringe. I am massively disappointed in S.J. Clarkson (the director) who has directed many great shows but somehow fumbled this one so bad that I consider this a horror movie to all movie fans. Tahar Rahim who played the main antagonist in the movie performed rather horribly. For some reason he could not show any emotion during his monologues and every time he appeared on screen I wanted to turn the movie off. I didn't have high hopes for this film but I was still disappointed. Yuck."
"Mar 18, 2024",POSITIVE,I love the movie I enjoy it I hope they make another part to madame web best movie ever
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,the story line is just bad
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Poor plot, bleak characters, did not enjoy.
All predictable and watch most on fast forward.
Story line came from a Kindergarten brainstorming session.

Seen all this before, too many times.
Please give us something new."
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Half a star? This is a Negative 100 stars movie, they should refund everyone who watches this god awful film.
Dull story, poor performances, cringe dialogs.
You can tell this movie was filmed heavily on a green screen and was built in an editing room several times, when the director saw this I am sure he died a bit inside. Please be better"
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I've seen one full movie (Bad Times at the El Royale) and 18 minutes of another movie (The High Note) where the cast included Dakota Johnson in major roles.  Her performance in ... El Royale was so bad, that the only reason I stuck with the movie was the rest of the cast ending with me enjoying the movie overall.  The High Note was advertised as a movie about Ross' character, which it was not, as Johnson was the lead.  18 minutes was all I could stand to watch.  Due to Johnson's past performances, I did not have high hopes that Madame Webb would be any good, and, it wasn't.  Having a parent as a somewhat successful actor doesn't mean it will translate to the child of said parent being any good at acting."
"Mar 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,Not so rotten as everyone says! Seen much worse movies than this.
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,i dont know what i just saw
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,This is like a tv production. As worse as Captain Marvel 2.
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"There are bad movies, there are atrocious movies, and then there's ""Madame Web."" If there's ever been a cinematic disaster that could make even the hardiest viewer question the existence of good taste, this would be it.
From the opening scene, to the end,  this film is a masterclass in how not to make a movie.The plot, if one could call it that, is a nonsensical mishmash of clichés and absurdities. Characters make decisions so mind-bogglingly stupid that you'll find yourself screaming at the screen in disbelief. The dialogue is riddled with cringe-inducing one-liners and attempts at humor that fall flatter than a pancake.

Even the most dedicated fans of B-movies will struggle to find anything redeeming about this train wreck of a film. It's not ""so bad it's good""; it's just plain bad. Save yourself the agony and steer clear of ""Madame Web"" unless you have a masochistic desire to subject yourself to the worst that cinema has to offer."
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"IS IT POSSIBLE TO GIVE NEGATIVE STARS?!
ANYONE SAYING ANYTHING POSITIVE ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS A LIAR. IT'S TRASH FROM START TO FINISH IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY.
YOU KNOW I AM RIGHT! STOP LYING!"
"Mar 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"A little slow at first, but did get up to speed"
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Waste of time watching this movie, I don't know why it was made!!!!"
"Mar 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"For me,it was a bit entertaining, a good way  to tell a prequel story and the very origins of one of our favs, i ean a spiderman's pregnant mom, a young uncle Ben.... I liked that. Maybe it would be better focusing on protect future baby spiderman instead those unknown girls. But still quite good"
"Mar 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,I did like it but more as a funny movie.
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Não é tão ruim quanto achei que seira! mais um filme de descoberta, porém linha temporal totalmente perdida... onde ela estava em vingadores que não fez nada?"
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Damn, at least with Morbius you have Matt Smiths performance, this just has nothing. ""When you take on great responsibility, great power will come"" sounded so bad that it felt like a piece of my love for spiderman died."
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,i had a whole breakdown of this movie in my head....but its just nonsense
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,I began watching this film with low expectations. My expectations were realized. This movie is an absolute dud. It might destroy the careers of those associated with it.
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"You see the girls being superheroes for TEN, thats right TEN seconds!!  Half a star, and thats being generous.  Discount Miguel's voice is dubbed and sounds ai generated. The lines were cringy, the acting was cringy, I dont know who thought this was acceptable to put out there but they need to be fired."
"Mar 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Worth the watch, much better than what the critics rated it."
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Stupid movie.  Everything in this movie doesn't made sense, so unrealistic and too many plot holes.  Like it was made for 8 year olds."
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Forgettable villain, and plot. Action sequences were boring. It was fun getting to see a young Ben Parker, and the premonition sequences were a little interesting as well. Dakota Johnson and the 3 other leads try their best with a weak story. This movie definitely falls flat and is easily the worst movie out of Sony's Spider-Manless universe"
"Mar 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,Not as bad as people are saying.
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Sony tried to get a group of well known female actresses and thought they could carry this poorly written script. Think Final Destination on a low budget.
"Mar 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"You have the power to watch a movie based on your own decisions.
Ignore the haters. 
I enjoyed the movie. Both my kids enjoyed the movie. 
We are our own individuals. Watch a movie if you want to. Don't let all the needless haters limit your consumption of beautiful art."
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Let me try to defend.
The big problem of the film is the empty script and undeveloped characters and weak dramaturgy.
But I think the actors are very good and the idea is not bad. If you choose the right audience (teens and young adults) I think it could work. Dakota is beautiful"
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"I went in with low expectations having seen the hate for Madame Web over the past few weeks. I liked the film, fun story, and really likeable characters too. reminded me a lot of the feel to the Sam Raimi Spider Man films and whilst its not a groundbreaking film- It is however a very entertaining couple of hours worth of popcorn fun."
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,THIS MOVIE STINKS!!!
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,i did not enjoy this
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"There might be a fun, oddly interesting, ""so bad that it's good"" movie with Madame Web, but it's marred by so many technical errors and misfires that it makes the film hard to take seriously on any level. Dakota Johnson and Sydney Sweeney are a strange pairing for a superhero movie setting up further adventures down the line.

<a href=""https://cinephilecorner.com/reviews/madame-web-movie-2024/"">Madame Web movie review</a>"
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Fue algo lenta, no es la peor película pero no es lo que esperaba en base al trailer que vi."
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,The critics are wrong. This movie is good.
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Move over Morbius, it's Madame Webbin time!
This absolute cinematic masterpiece showcases the most articulate villain ever to hit the big screen, pitched against Madame Web, a super hero who weilds the indomitable power of Pepsi. I can't wait to see this  expanded into a cinematic universe with Jamie Dornan returning as main antagonist!"
"Mar 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's another way to try to tell a Spider-Man story without Spider-Man, it has some good moments on the movie but mostly not that all, I like the conexión about madame web visions, but not the conexión about the story and characters"
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was kinda slow but it made it exciting to see what the future holds for the three younger girls. I hope that Marvel will try this story again as I think with great writers, it could be a hit."
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,I thought. Madame Web really was appositely incredible. story of the three young teenage girls finding out of their true selfies as marvels in the hole movie!
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,I liked this movie and thought Dakota did good in her part. It was a little slow in the very beginning but it was good.
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"I feel like this movie was genuinely good and a very fresh ""Spider-Man"" movie! While I will admit this movie has a slow start and a weird pacing/tone overall it was a very sweet and enjoyable movie that could have many cameos through the Spiderverse! In short, very nice movie with bad reviews."
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie is terrible; very poor quality and very poorly written. Throw out the person who hired the people who made Morbius because they made it even worse. The protagonist did not do well. He recommends his movie and then says he didn't see it. Lousy visual effects. It seems like it's a movie if it ends. The villain seems to have had his dialogue superimposed. There is no chemistry between the actresses. The villain is defeated by a Pepsi Cola letter!!! A MEDIOCRE movie
"Mar 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I went in with low expectations having seen the hate for Madame Web over the past few weeks. I really liked the film, fun story, well acted, and really likeable characters too.  reminded me a lot of the feel to the Sam Raimi Spider Man films and whilst its not a groundbreaking film- It is however a very entertaining couple of hours worth of popcorn fun."
"Mar 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I read the reviews and thought I'd give this a watch to see just how bad it is, truth is, it isn't, there are a lot better superhero movies out there, but there a lot worse. The Marvels and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania being two of them."
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,errrr this film has to be the worse thing I've ever seen
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,I thought the movie was really good.a very good intro movie for new characters
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Kind of waste of time. If you have nothing better to watch and want to kill some time this is the movie. The fight scenes were embarrassing and the final fighting scene was so disappointing. Acting was below average, editing was terrible"
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"That was painful to watch. From the opening scene at the ambulance Dakota showed absolutely zero emotion in acting. Well the rest of the cast was also the same. The story is somewhere between bad and vary bad. The last battle of the movie does not even try to keep you engaged.
I watched the movie in hopes that people were overreacting , but nope, it is as bad as people say it is"
"Mar 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Its not as horrible as everyone on the internet says it is. The plot was good It wasn't horrible it had good themes. It wasn't forced ""girl power"" unless you are actually looking for that then yes you can find it. but its not as prominent as you would think. The actors were good the dialogue wasn't horrible. I don't think a sequel should be in discussion though."
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Movie is bad in every way imaginable, I was barely able to watch it."
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Uh, it's not boring, I guess.

Normally I would try to come up with a review or at least share my thoughts, but I'm at a genuine loss for words. What the heck, Sony."
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie kept getting better and better, I was so hooked, and then in the last 20 minutes, it fell off a cliff into cringe abyss. The potential was there. I mean I cried several times leading up to the cringey finale… like I would've watched a series of many episodes of how it was building. The last scene was horrific writing that didn't make sense."
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"There was a reason this movie was 13% but…hear me out yall!  Let me put something down and if yall can pick it up….this movie…could…legit get a 47%.  Idk why people aren't acting like there isn't structure and a plot, the editing and possible every other aspect of this movie was equivalent to a toilet after Taco Bell…but nonetheless it wasn't a bunch of scenes mashed together.  It was a bunch of scenes mashed together, with structure.   F u Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney was good but we all know ur not young enough to keep playing teenagers.  Ur pushing 30 bbg."
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie! Good character development and storyline. Definitely a fan. I hate they didn't do so well in theaters as I fear they may not make a Madame Web 2.
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I normally am pretty forgiving of super hero movies, but this ones story line was dysfunctional. The way the three girls were portrayed was irritating, and dis-ingenious of how girls that age really behave (i.e. it was contrived). Dakotas parts were good when she was not with the girls, and her back story was well done too. But her trip to Peru was so ""quick"" as to have almost no need in the story line. Yes, she learned ""stuff"", but there was no coming to grips with her abilities as in ""how to use them"". Finally, the last ten minutes so much happened as to make the movie seem squeezed; I can't say much more about it without spoiling it. 

Perhaps if the movie had a longer running time they could have developed Peru, the girls and fleshed out the ending better."
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,worst movie i have seen in a while. really hope they dont make another one. i cant believe this made it to theaters. it just goes to show you that it is ultimately the wealthiest studios control what we see in theaters. i
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I was expecting more, acting was mediocre at best."
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie. It was fast paced. It has action, suspense and kept me on the edge of my seat. I never thought Dakota Johnson could pull off a movie like this one, but she was fantastic. She was believable and likeable. The movie has been panned by critics and audiences alike and I just don't understand why. It's really a shame that the movie didn't fare better at the box office. I want to see the rest of the story, and because of the financials, there probably won't be a sequel. Do yourself a favor... ignore the critics and watch it for yourself. I bet you'll enjoy it too."
"Mar 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,Its really not that bad  i think script and the way they wrote some characters make is corny but i would watch again
"Mar 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This was not the movie the trailer sent to the audience to sell tickets for. If they would have hid the spider-girl characters from the trailer, I firmly believe that there would have been a “NoWay Home” kind of vibe, and would have had more of a chance to almost guarantee a sequel. Madame Web is an origin story, and I think the folks that hated it were misled by the trailer. It was a good origin story that could have had some legs if it wasn’t ravaged by bad reviews. I personally liked it as well as my son. It’s worth the time to watch it and come up with your own review. Never trust any reviews until you have seen the movie yourself. I think this one was an underrated underdog movie and deserves an honest review. Hopefully my review gives that type of credit. I personally hope that there is a bigger story to the Madame Web franchise, or integrated into Sony future Marvel character movies, because the Madam Web story has more to offer. "
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Madame Web offers an original take on superhero movies that strays from the same tired recipe we've all seen a million times: shoot, punch, joke and punch some more. The female protagonists make you like them and care, and the origin story and superhero ability of Cassie is refreshingly different, with endless possibilities for the future. It seems that critics and audience alike are unable to see beyond their pre-conditioned prejudices of what a good superhero movie should be, and said prejudice limits their mental capacity and artistic imagination to perceive the power of the mind's potential over stupid's jet-lagged physicality. This is, ironically, the actual point of the plot and the downfall of the villain, whom reviewers so adamantly criticize as bland, not realizing they are one in the same. Open your mind. See the web. And if you can't see it, think more deeply before speaking, or at least ask somebody who hasn't been plucked from the masses."
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Was this a B movie or a C movie? Oof.. this was trash skip skip!
"Mar 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,Just eh. I believe this movie was ruined on the editing floor.
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Ooof. Plot holes, bad acting, and terrible screenplay  that no amount of web could save. Don't waste your time."
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,The movie is trippy it's lame it's not the worst movie ever or Marvel movie but we all saw it coming from miles away that it would flop but it had a good cast and it was ok
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame web was meh, this is way worst then i thought, this is the worst thing that sony pictures has ever done to the spider-man lore. I really like dakota Johnson however all those other actresses deserve better then this. I enjoyed both venom movies then those pieces of 🐕💩, the script, the dialogue music score etc everything about this movie is awful and boring it's unwatchable, nothing exciting or thrilling about it. Sony should cancel making spinoffs if there's no Spider-Man appearing anywhere what's the point of it  Sony should 🛑 this is a biggest mistake they've ever done 
#Makeraimispiderman4
#MakeTASM3"
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Embarrasingly stupid
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Please don't waste your time on this one. I tend to ignore the haters, but this time they're on the money. The DIALOG? Absolutely horrible. The portrayal of the villain was simply awkward. The story is confusing: too much explication of the wrong things. The Origin Story is shown twice, and yet there's no clues for how the girls get their 'powers' in the future (shown in redundant clips). I will say that the main actors (Dakota Johnson and the three girls) did an amazing job with what they had to work with. Zero."
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I thought spider-man far from home was the weakest of them all, but oh how I was wrong. this is the worst spider-man movie I've ever seen in my entire life! The characters were just cringe, the story was so unpredictable, and it's just so slow paste! I will never watch this movie EVER again."
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is the greatest web genre of movie I have ever seen, I especially enjoyed when she announced she was Madame web and webbed all over everyone. My personal favourite actor in the film was John cena, his webbed based performance was unparalleled. I have watched this film 642 times already this week, it's amazing"
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The main characters acting was forgettable, and the scenes and CGI seemed rushed and not well thought out."
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Just stop with Marvel movies, they are just awful now, especially the Converse."
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The reason for a 2 star review is that the story was very confusing and badly written. The main character Cassie had the first 41 minutes of back story. Ezekiel 5 minutes beginning of movie. 3 girls we don't know much about. yet they are supporting actresses. The way the movie ends, leaves many questions without answers. To me this full movie is just a back story so there can be a sequel. Also it would of been better for it to be a tv show introducing characters and then a movie."
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"I was very spectacle about this movie. Considering the previews spider-related movies were pretty bad (venom, venom 2, no way home, across the spiderverse). But I was surprisingly fun and entertaining. Definitely their best installment in spider-related media."
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie is so bad that I created a rotten tomato account to tell you about it. 
Superhero movies can defy logic,  but throwing basic story telling and common sense or the window can ruin them, and madame web or whatever screwed the pooch on all fronts.  15 min a dump truck slams into an ambulance at 60mph or so.  Seconds later an arial shot shows that it was about 20ft away from driving into a river.  Later,  the garbage main character has a vision of walking to a diner, beating the villan by a good minute.  She snaps out of it and drives her car at 60ish, making it there after he arrives. By the way,  all this time,  3 girls are dancing on a table at said diner and no employee screams at them to get the eff down.  Madame web also never gets pulled over,  driving said car around NYC for a day with no plates... because she pried them off with a crow bar; which is totally something you can do. 

Outside of all that,  the dialog is flat and bad,  the acting is dry and boring,  the character devdevelopment is nonexistent, and calling the plot empty would be generous."
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I have no idea how someone actually thought this was material worthy of making people spend their money and time to watch it. It is a strong contender to worst ""superhero"" movie ever."
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Sometimes a movie is so badly reviewed you can come into with low expectations and get some enjoyment out of it...this is not one of those movies.  Wow!  script writer, director, producer, casting agent..should never be allowed on another movie set again.  I could not make it thru this movie.  lead actress was horribly miscast for this role.  This movie was so bad does not matter who the lead actress as.  I hope Dakota Johnson fired everyone that did not stop her from doing this movie.   If the Razzies have a hall of fame everyone Involved with this movie should be inducted."
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,I think part 2 is required because I really want to know the stolen spiders and the girls future🙃 but it was the best❤️😘
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,I'm looking forward to future movies. Maybe one where they meet peter Parker or venom.
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The movie idea and story is not bad.
but the weakness in acting and directing mmmm sorry to see the most experienced actor Adam scott do not play a main character while the others are acting like school theater.
Not worth it to go for cinema for it.
It should be tv movie not big screen"
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,How can you make such a bad movie with so much ressources.
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"They shouldnt show that movie it was efen disturbing, cant imagine trauma people who took their kids to watch it in the cinemas. If it even airs in cinemas that I doubt"
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie.  I don't get all of the negative press.  It was a good move, well cast and well acted.  The storyline was good and well written.  Good to see strong female characters for a change. I streamed it but would have gladly paid the movie rate had I known it would be so good."
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Boring plot, only wanted to see 3 spiderwoman and it gave me cliffhanger."
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"complete rubbish utterly garbage, a waste of time."
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"The film isn't the worst thing in the world, on the contrary, if you watch it without being based on the comics, it's a super cool film."
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This is by far one of the worst movies ever made. Please watch it, cause it is such a beautiful train wreck with every scene being horrible. Every single person involved with this movie gave the absolute worst they could possible give to a project."
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,I absolutely loved this movie! The cast is great especially Dakota Johnson! I think people go into movies with this preconceived notion a movie has to be or go a certain way. It's a story for a reason. I think if you go into it thinking wow this is a story that someone created to be its own. Ideas from comics yes but doesn't have to be exactly the same. Dakota said the original script is what made her sign on but things change and I don't think it is a bad horrible movie. I think critics made everyone else hate it and put it in their heads before they went into it.
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The negative reviews for Madame Web are completely justified, there simply isn't any redeeming qualities here. The film drowns in generic plotlines and fails to capture the intrigue of its source material. The clunky dialogue with an overreliance on exposition dumps, feels so dumbed down, yet nonsensical. It's a tangled mess that swings and misses on every level."
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Terrible casting, writing, acting, directing and CGI. Everything about this film should not have been done."
"Mar 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,I sat bored for most of the start. It would ramp up then flatten out. However there was a twist in the movie I never saw until I read the credits and saw the last name for Ben. It was more enjoyable than most people say but not by much.
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"40 minutes in and main character has done nothing and just believes she's crazy with the slowest reaction.  Thank God I'm streaming it, not even sure I want to finish."
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Entertaining I liked the progression of the relationships between the characters. Sad that people didn't like it i would like to see the Marvel Universe expand in this direction.
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A feverish nightmare where, just when you think you're about to wake up, Madame Web drags you back into her lair of poor filmmaking, lazy writing and questionable acting."
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,I like it… it's not a marvel super production But it still a good movie!
"Mar 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I don't understand the mainstream intense dislike of this movie. I think it's a very good ""setup"" for things to come. Spoiler alert incoming, since I believe most have seen this movie by now. I suppose a lot of folks may have felt ""tricked"" by the trailer because it seems like a superhero movie, but the superhero element is grounded, a little too grounded. The action is there but you think you're going to see 3 kick-butt spider-girls and you're really not. The entire movie is spent on Cassie's fleshing out her 'powers' and saving 3 girls from almost certain death at the hands of a villain intent on preventing his own death at their hands. All this analysis of how predictable it is, well, yeah, most superhero movies are. There are a few lines I think the movie could have gone without, but it is what it is. I hope that the bad reception doesn't stop what could or can be, great sequels or movies with these characters in them later on."
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Ok, just saw this. In my own personal opinion, while this may not be a groundbreaking, Marvel production, it certainly isn't as bad as most critics made it out to be. I personally think this is even slightly better than Morbius. Perhaps I didn't have any expectations about the movie before going in, and just let it entertain me which it did."
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I never thought writing and a script could be this bad. From Madame web dropping into Pero where she magically came up on the same exact spot where mom died but when you see a ""A $20.00 Skyrocket"" blow a giant hole in Brick wall to make their escape is beyond bad it's movie trash. I feel bad Sony went this low and actually let this not escape the trash can. A horrible water of money and digital storage. They had to do the ""Bless you"" at the end just for bad measure. Of course let's not let pass the ""Underwater Skyrockets Too. The Fire is so pretty UNDER WATER MOVING SO FAST"""""" FUNNY I NEVER SAW SKYROCKETS GET OXYGEN UNDERWATER TO KEEP FLYING LIKE TORPEDOES"""""" THE ABSOLUTE WORST"""""""
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Once in a generation of spiders a movie will come along that is somehow better than morbius... this is not that movie... this movie is so great that it is not made for you,  who ever you are, and what ever you like,  it will subvert your expectations and leave your feeling alone and confused 

Ps can someone please explain thy the Sweeney girl is promoted as hot?"
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,I'd love to go into detail about the movie but I can't get over how good of a role Sydney Sweeney played. If only she was the only character this movie might have been better 😁. Nevertheless watching Sydney Sweeney take down villains in her fresh superhero suit was amazing. Will 100% be watching the second one
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Wow Sydney Sweeney was so attractive! Cant wait to see the second movie. Clean up Aisle my brain! It feels violently thrashed and pissed on. Would be better if it followed a well written plot, or had better script writing. Or if sony when making it put and comprehensive amount of brain power into it. Felt like a weird acid trip. 10/10 make the next budget doubled!"
"Mar 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,its honestly good expected ALOT worse tbh
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"I don't understand all the awful reviews for this movie.  When this movie came out on PPV, I did not think twice about buying the movie and I am glad I did.  ""Madame Web"" surpassed all my expectations.   It is one of those ""RARE"" Superhero movie where it is not plagued with ridiculous ""jokes"", in the contrary, it's a serious superhero movie."
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,The acting was wooden which is usually a sign of bad direction.  The story also meandered.  I've seen plenty of bad super hero movies but this one commits the cardinal sin of being boring as well.
"Mar 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,It was more enjoyable than the critics say but go into it with low expectations.
"Mar 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,It wasnt a bad movie but it wasnt a good movie either. i think they could have made the story a little bettter but i actually enjoyed it i wasnt bored i just think some plot holes could have been fixed and would love to have seen more action.
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Another epic failure from Disney, the scrip was terrible, the direction was worst, and the writting sooooo corny and predictable. The actreses were mediocre to say the least, I don't care about any of them, it takes almost 80% of the movie before anything of consequence or interesting happens, and the bad guy .....what a horrible actor. How is it that the villan can jump down 20 stories and land on his feet and at the end he is defeated by falling from a 2 story building? TAnd the factory is shooting firworks that can destroy wall and concrete floors?, but it's supposed to be an explosives factory, that shoots rockets like flares? Leave it to Disney to destroy a franchise."
"Mar 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"madame web is a decent watch. It has some entertaining moments and a few good performances, but overall it falls a bit flat. The plot feels predictable, and the pacing could have been tighter. However, if you're looking for a casual movie night option, it might suffice."
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I wish I could vote minus 9 (-9) so bad that movie is.
For a moment I would like to see the bad guy killing the 3 girls soon so the movie would end? Thank God I didn't went the theater to watch this. Would a be wast of my money"
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed the movie… Dakota was lack luster but the supporting cast really brought it. A little all over the place but the music was fire lol. I think if we removed madam web from the follow up movie the girls will carry this saga
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Awful Movie. Don't waste your time.
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Hope there is a sequel
"Mar 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,Its a decent superhero action movie. Really dont deserve the hate.
"Mar 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie was definitely not the best I've seen, not even in my top 20, but I don't understand why it's getting so much hate. 

Firstly, sure it's writing isn't the best but it is entertaining and kept me watching, despite not being your typical 'superhero' movie.

Secondly, the movie was heartwarming. I liked it quite a lot. The relationship between Cassie and the girls made me happy, as none of the girls really had a mother figure."
"Mar 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,They misunderstood their source material. Sony should sell their rights of spider-man before they distort any more stories from the spider-verse.
"Mar 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Decent performances, great visuals, predictable storyline, almost entertaining."
"Mar 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Waste of money. What is going on with all this movies that are rotten.
"Mar 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The Actresses really tried but everything was Really Bad. This was worse then Morbius
I would be happy to rewatch Morbius 5 times instead watching a Minute of Madam Web"
"Mar 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"""Madam Web"" is a film that falls short of expectations, delivering a lackluster and sleep-inducing experience. With a poorly executed storyline, it fails to captivate audiences from start to finish.

The screenplay feels hastily put together, lacking depth and coherence. Character development is virtually nonexistent, leaving viewers disconnected from the protagonists' struggles and motivations. As a result, it's challenging to invest emotionally in the narrative, leading to a disengaged viewing experience.

One of the major drawbacks of ""Madam Web"" is its pacing. The film moves at a sluggish pace, with scenes dragging on without purpose or intrigue. This sluggishness contributes to the overall sense of boredom and apathy that permeates the viewing experience.

Despite attempts to inject excitement with action sequences, they feel forced and formulaic, failing to provide any genuine thrills or suspense. Even the most visually stunning moments are unable to compensate for the lack of substance in the storytelling.

In addition to its narrative shortcomings, ""Madam Web"" suffers from uninspired direction and lackluster performances. The cast struggles to breathe life into their characters, delivering wooden and unconvincing portrayals that further detract from the film's appeal.

Overall, ""Madam Web"" is a forgettable cinematic endeavor that fails to leave a lasting impression. With its lack of originality, poor execution, and tedious pacing, it's a film best avoided by discerning viewers seeking a compelling and engaging cinematic experience."
"Mar 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"it is good for a family movie, but definitely not a Marvel hardcore fan's fantasy I had so many expectations and it didn't even meet halfway,not a single scene that got me excited ,literally a movie for children who are 14 ,if your an adult and you enjoyed this movie I pray for your change of taste  ,not to mention the absence of post credit preview"
"Mar 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Possibly the worst Marvel movie so far, didn't really get the message from the movie.
Dakota Johnson did a great job, but that's it!"
"Mar 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Horrible wht is wrong with u who made this horrible disgusting movie
"Mar 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie was incredible, me and my cousin absolutely loved watching this. SO FUN!!! 👑👑👑"
"Mar 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,Here is my own opinion if you have other opinions I respect it: this movie was actually good there was a lot of positive themes like teamwork but also in the beginning there was like an equalizer kind of for people who didn't like it I still respect the opinion but this movie was good
"Mar 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was definitely a waste of my hard earn money and time. Sony needs to stop creating films without spiderman in it.
"Mar 14, 2024",POSITIVE,This was an entertaining movie. It seemed like a live action comic book story. Some dialogue was a little hokey but so are comic books. 
"Mar 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Sony Sony and more Sony please stop of make a spiderman universe without spiderman you ruined my life Sony no sony
"Mar 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Easily the WORST movie I have ever seen. My bf took me for a first date. Would have walked out after the first 10 minutes if It weren't for him. We couldn't think of a worse movie
"Mar 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The special effects were good, but the acting was bad for me. I couldn't see their adrenaline, for people who are supposed to fight or in do or die situations, the acting was not at all believable. It was so relaxed. The plot could have been done so much better, but instead it was rushed and the way the scenes were weaved was like cut-and-paste; no smooth transitions. To be honest, I fell asleep for a few minutes at a time."
"Mar 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"I was hesitant about seeing this movie after reading the critics, but I like to see most of the Marvel movies.  I thought it was great, entertaining, and I liked that it had a plot I could follow along on for a change.  I through Dakota has gotten a bad rap.  Her acting was very good playing just a normal person who discovers she has powers.  It was a learning curve that was fun to watch with the effects.  Many of the effects were different in this movie, probably that is why everyone is criticizing the movie. But who wants to watch the same Marvel movie every time.  And I enjoyed that the character was like a mother, protector for the three girls.  Go see it and keep an open mind.  It was good"
"Mar 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Unfortunately, this was a major disappointment. Ugh, where to begin.. So much was just... Awful. The casting, the characters were flat, the plot was meh, the tropes were so overdone, very overt product placement, cheesy cringe. Nothing was enjoyable at all. Total waste of my money."
"Mar 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Terrible, an absolute joke..."
"Mar 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"waste of time, don't watch this movie"
"Mar 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie. I'm a long time Spiderman fan and I remember her character from the comics and cartoon. They did a really good job showing her origin story and Dakota Johnson performed amazingly. 

I hope they continue her story showing her guiding Tom Holland's, Toby Maguire's and Andrew Garfield's Spiderman; set after their last movies (since as we know she can travel timelines and the multiverse). It would be cool to see her correct the timelines to keep them as they should be so the world remains safe, as she knows everything that has, is and will happen."
"Mar 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,"""Madame Web"" is an utterly unnecessary superhero film, based on a farly obscure character in the Spider-man universe.

It joins the growing niche of ‘Spider-man movies without Spider-man"" produced by Columbia Pictures, which includes 2018's ""Venom"", 2023's ""Morbius"" and the as-yet unreleased ""Kraven"".

""Madame Web"" is a watchable bad movie. Dakota Johnson plays Cassie Webb, an NYC paramedic who is ambivalent and coldly detached from her profession of saving lives. She hasn't yet learned that with great power comes great responsibility.

An accident knocks her into the East River, which somehow triggers a penchant for  clairvoyance. Clearly this isn't the best origin story in the annals of Marvel comics or movies.

The story picks up with Cassie on a commuter train and envisioning an assassin killing 3 young ladies. And right on cue there are the 3 girls and the Baddie is in the next train car. Ruh-roh.

Much of the film is Cassie playing Mother Hen to the trio, played by Sidney Sweeney, Isabel Merced and Celeste O'Connor. We glean that the 3 are prospective heroes in waiting if this franchise can get off the ground.

The film never takes off and we're left wondering who thought it was a good idea to attempt a stand-alone film with Madame Web?

I did appreciate some on-location scenes shot  in New York City, including some face time for my favorite ‘hoods in Queens: Astoria and Long Island City.

During the promotional tour for ""Madame Web"", Dakota Johnson freely admitted that she hasn't watched the film and has no plans to. So even Madame Web isn't a fan of ""Madame Web"". Don't bank on a sequel."
"Mar 13, 2024",POSITIVE,Great story with a new take on the spider-verse
"Mar 13, 2024",NEUTRAL,I would recommend it. I was surprised that there was no post credit scene.
"Mar 13, 2024",POSITIVE,"THIS WAS PEAK CINEMA! I LOVED THE ENDING! 

MY FAVORITE PART IS WHEN IT ENDED!"
"Mar 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Very silly and rubbish storyline. Very bad script and very bad acting.
1/5 is still too high. Absolutely awful 
😞"
"Mar 13, 2024",POSITIVE,God this movie sucks
"Mar 13, 2024",POSITIVE,"Me pareció una película original, entretenida , diferente , y aún no entiendo por que tiene mala critica. Si al fin se hace una película con guion original , y es bien dinámica."
"Mar 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,The worst SSU movie is not worth the money for the movie.
"Mar 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This really shows on how Sony just rushes their movies why can't they just leave their creatives alone, and let them do their thing so they can create a masterpiece like spider verse"
"Mar 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Bad movie,. ""Yeah. I watched penguinz0's review, so I pretty much got the whole movie in under 16 minutes."""
"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE,Madam web is  amazing Marvel movie it was very entertaining.
"Mar 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Worst... movie.. ever

Editing was terrible, story is irrelevant and they keep trying to use Spider-Man references to grab the audiences attention but are made more to feel as a joke"
"Mar 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,Well..the movie doesnt sit well with me.. the audio that doesnt match the lips.. or the fact how they force the accident to make Madame Web blind.. the movie feels dragging..
"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE,The suspense was there throughout the movie!    The acting was believable & the CGI was tremendous!
"Mar 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,"That was…a trip. Not a good one- at all. If you know the meme of the fake cat sitting on a block with its hands out like it's trying to say ""what the hell?"" That was me during the entire movie. Everything sort of just came out of nowhere, despite being given context. It jumped from vision back to reality so much that it was horrendously confusing. The ending was awful and I think that's the only way I can describe it-"
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I believe this movie is a great candidate for future midnight showings in the vein of the room. Bad Script. wooden acting and awful plot mechanics all make for a possible cult classic. It's amazing that this got greenlite. Spoiler Alert: they had a newspaper show a Frontpage story only 3 hours later after the incident happen midday.  A character traveled out the country as a wanted person post 911, ridiculous. A bright spot is Dakota Johnson being a good sport in the media. Definitely  watch on streaming if you like bad fun movies."
"Mar 11, 2024",NEUTRAL,The pacing was slow & plodding. Nothing to get excited about.  No thrills.
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,Horrible superhero movie
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,It's been a really long time since I've seen something so so soooo stupid. My god kill me now
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This film is an example of ""just because you have an idea, doesn't mean it will work"". The characters are irrelevant. Nothing about the setting or editing makes sense. The cast is wasted on every level or completely out of their element. Simply put: nothing about this movie works as it should."
"Mar 11, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I don't understand why this movie got so much hate. It is just as good as any other superhero movie. I mean, yeah, it's not as epic as seeing every Marvel superhero band together to defeat Thanos, but it tells a decent story with decent acting. I was never bored and thought the mainly female cast worked well together. I would watch it again and would even watch a sequel."
"Mar 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,Morbius writers strike again!
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,This was awful but almost to the point it was entertaining. I have no idea why Dakota Johnson gets these roles she is absolutely terrible in everything she's ever been in
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Pe


Totaly lost of my time, wish i havent seen it"
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"Loved, ready for the series"
"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"Oh yes The dark knight really do be goodest film, especially Harrison Ford's gripping performance as Shaquille O'Teal

"Mar 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"The biggest reason I loved it was because whenever she would ""see into the future"" that's exactly how I felt when I took acid. Like I would see into tha future, exactly how tha movie presents it. Masterpiece 👌🏼👌🏼"
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,Great actors best 30 bucks I spent
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Al principio no se entiende mucho pero más adelante ya se entiende mejor
"Mar 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,"3.15/5. The two best things going for the film is that it delves into one's personal journey more and is defined by sincerity.
Also, it's better than people say.
The final two scenes could have been stronger, however."
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was horrible I didn’t really enjoy it. people were right about how this movie sucks. Not a lot of action except the three girls running away from the villain. When the the movie was over a lot of people were booing and threw stuff at the screen.
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"If it wasn't for the 4dx seats, I'd have been fast asleep.
The type of superhero movie they used to make in the 80's and 90's, and that isn't a compliment."
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,It was awesome and a definite must see.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"Honestly a fantastic Spider-Universe movie -- possibly my favorite live-action one since the Tobey Maguire trilogy back in the 00's! I know it's doing badly at the box office, but I think this may be a case of a hidden gem that gets fondly remembered later. The vibe reminded of ""Terminator 2"" and was more of a deadly chase movie than a standard superhero film. It's also a movie that will have much more to offer to hardcore than casual Spidey fans. There's so many allusions to cool stuff in the comic lore here that aren't necessary to understand the movie, but make it so much better if you do.

Don't believe the lousy ticket receipts -- this one IS worth your time and was extremely fun!"
"Mar 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Me duele ver una película que solo te vende lo bueno de la película en los Trailers, para ver su contenido original con tan 0 aporte en la trama, chistes malisimos y la verdad este tipo de películas no aportan nada en el universo de Spiderman sin Spiderman, las actuaciones dejan mucho que desear y un villano vacío qué no transmite nada para este tipo de películas. Se nota que los ejecutivos de Sony no se toman enserio este tipo de películas."
"Mar 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Not as action packed as most Marvel based movies, but still entertaining. There were definitely some plot holes and an uninspiring villain, but at least it was more original than some recent offerings. As a standalone movie (with no knowledge of the character portrayed in comics) it stands up ok on its own as a decent (but not great) movie."
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,High energy with lots of suspense. The movie includes warm and fluffy moments!
"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,Michael over here who rated this trash movie 5 stars obviously needs to get his head fixed
"Mar 8, 2024",NEUTRAL,Idk what yall talkn bout !! My fam & I liked it!!
"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,Apresenta uma nova ideia sobre filme de herói porem se perde muito no começo do filme quando está apresentando as heroínas. Ótimas atrízes que foram desperdiçadas.
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was a great movie of female heroins in
This origin story. The Villain didn't scare me or bring anything to the storyline to make me believe he was who he was. Could've replaced him. The girls were awesome and it was a family friendly movie too."
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,I've never watched a better film! The action is so good!
"Mar 8, 2024",NEUTRAL,Expansion in the Marvel Universe
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,The villain could of been better and I wish the girls would have got their powers in the movie but overall not terrible
"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie sucked so much it hurt my tum tum
"Mar 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"There are elements of a good film here, but they're watered down by poor performances, terrible writing and a runtime that only seems to grow longer as more time passes. At most, it's amusingly awful."
"Mar 8, 2024",NEUTRAL,The movie was entertaining somewhat.
"Mar 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Oof, this stinker was more rotten than usual."
"Mar 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Incoming hordes of reviews of people saying ""it was fun"""
"Mar 7, 2024",NEUTRAL,pepsi sign and fireworks
"Mar 7, 2024",NEUTRAL,It's like a parody of Spider-Man. It's not bad for pasting time but not suggest to watch if you're a person which likes new themes.
"Mar 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,if there was ever a movie that defined so bad its good this would be it.
"Mar 7, 2024",NEUTRAL,It had great CGI great ART great ACTORS great BACKGROUND great STARTING but POOR NARRATION
"Mar 7, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's really not as bad as the reviews are saying. The villain is completely 2D but otherwise it's a solid origin and a little different. It's smaller than most super hero movies and didn't feature a finale fight in the sky which I was so grateful for. 
I wondered why Emma Roberts was in this in such a seemingly giveaway role… and then it all fit together in the end 🤯.
  I don't think it'll happen but this one did all the heavier backstory origin stuff I'm super curious for what the next one would be."
"Mar 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"Despite the poor reviews was pleasantly surprised, gripping and well made movie with some fan favourite actors. Definitely worth giving it a shot!!"
"Mar 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The film was just awful, the plot has more holes then swiss cheese. 

If you have a medical background don't watch this, the inaccuracies of the Paramedics during the scenes will make your blood boil, for example doing CPR on someone with no AED attached, without exposing their chest and then being called by their supervisor to leave the person and help them with something else which is miraculously the time the supposed dead person starts breathing and trying to sit up. In fact CPR was done on so many people in the film without the correct equipment or techniques being followed. 

The characters don't seem to be gelled and appear believable, the lines wooden, the jokes (or presumed to be) stale. 

Even the cinematic experience what Marvel are known for is missing, it doesn't have the flair and skill of other universe films."
"Mar 7, 2024",NEUTRAL,"So so, is more or less good story but id bad set it, and the wrong statement about the responsibility and power put it down the script"
"Mar 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely Garbage. The dialogue is pathetic. The attempts at acting are as lame, stilted and boring as a high school film production, where nobody in it actually cares to try to act. If you watch this train wreck, and think it was acceptable, then you must be an ignorant child."
"Mar 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"My bsf and I watched this movie the other day and I don't understand the hate. We loved it right away. This was such a fun chick flick. I know it's not marketed as one but come on? Everything about this screams camp. Obviously you would hate it if you're expecting a blockbuster marvel/sony universe movie which spoiler alert it isn't.
You have to go in with the right mindset
 I can see myself unironically rewatching it from time to time as a feel-good kinda movie."
"Mar 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"Way better than I expected, the cast have great screen presence, and I didn't think many of the negative aspects detracted too much from what made the movie interesting.  Loved a lot of the first responder humor.    Go learn and practice CPR, it could save the life of someone you love!!"
"Mar 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,Ever wonder how to make a film worse than Morbius? This is how.
"Mar 7, 2024",NEUTRAL,6/10. 61/100. | First half is definitely better than the last half. It just falls short. As if the writers quit and AI took over. They sped up too quick too. Especially during the 3rd act.
"Mar 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"I don't understand the hate this movie is receiving. I thought it was very good and entertaining. Good acting and never once did I look at my phone to check the time to see when it would be over. Was it a huge blockbuster? No, but I personally don't think any Marvel ones are. Entertaining and worth a watch in my opinion."
"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE,Way better than critics said.
"Mar 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,I want my money back. That was just terrible. I can't believe they messed up something which could have been great.
"Mar 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,Complete Garbage!... Shame on you Marvel!
"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"I was told there were a lot of negative reviews for this film so I went in with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised at how entertaining it was. Thoughtfully made plot, good characters played by talented actors, well timed comical quips, touching scenes. As a Marvel fan I thought it was refreshing to take a step out of the crazy multi-verse drama to have a (for now) standalone movie with new characters. I do hope they make a second one and I hope the story and characters get better from here."
"Mar 6, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It was ok.  I wouldn't recommend it but, at least it had a plot to it."
"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE,Definitely not a 1 star
"Mar 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was terrible and boring
"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"Madame Webb is a film which enthrals you from minute one to the last with its captivating script and storyline. The scenes were picturesque and captured with pure quality and I think all of the actors, predominately Dakota Johnson aced her role of playing Cassandra Webb, showing that she belongs in the Marvel Universe. The actors all gel nicely together which makes the film free flowing and easy to get gripped by it. The way they implemented  flashbacks also to give us an insight on Ezekiel and Cassandra's moms past and what occurred helped me obtain a deeper understanding on why things were occurring in the movie and it illuminated the storyline more! Overall Madame Webb achieves high praise myself and I would definitely recommend."
"Mar 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,Nah. That’s my take. Half a star for attempting an origin story that’s heavily needed for the Spiderverse. Half a star for someone involving Mike Epps in a superhero movie (idk how they gave the biggest name in the movie the smallest role). And half a star for luring me in to watching this and wasting 116 minutes of my life. Bravo. From becoming to finish I tried to get into it. I really did. I honestly think this is the worst marvel movie of all time (even worse than the first Hulk movie).
"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"Ich fand den Film gut und spannend. Ich hoffe, dass Dakota Johnson ein weiteres Mal in der Rolle zusehen ist. Verstehe nicht wieso der Film so gehatet wird."
"Mar 6, 2024",NEUTRAL,"""Madame Web"" offers a captivating cinematic experience, anchored by Dakota Johnson's remarkable portrayal of the titular character. Johnson's performance shines throughout the film, showcasing her depth and range as an actress. While the story may feel somewhat weak at times, requiring a bit more mental stretching from the audience, it nevertheless succeeds in captivating and engaging viewers. The side actors complement Johnson's performance with their own strong portrayals, adding depth and richness to the narrative. Despite its shortcomings, ""Madame Web"" ultimately delivers an entertaining and memorable moviegoing experience."
"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"I watched it in cinema and loved it. I get it's not everyone's cup of tea but for me a female protagonist spider man movie was awesome.
Dakota played her part very well and held my ADHD attention throughout the entire movie.
I think there is potential for a sequel, would love to see what the girls get up to as adults."
"Mar 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"i would rate this a 0, but thats impossible. so i give you a one."
"Mar 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie was so bad it was painful to watch. I actually feel bad for the actress in this movie because I do not know if they will ever get work after this movie.
"Mar 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,i would rather watch a 2 hour Pepsi commercial...Chris Sturniolo would love this movie
"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie feels like a prank someone played on Dakota Johnson 10/10 no notes
"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE,Not bad at all.  Based on what I heard I thought it was going to be horrible and it wasn’t.  It’s worth watching in theaters.
"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE,Dakota Johnson was perfect as Madame Web.
"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE,Loved it!  Just what I needed. A fun movie with a twist.
"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"I gave this 5 star because i think it was a good movie, i enjoyed it! People kept going on about this movie being a spiderverse without spider man, well people spiderman was just being born at the very end of this movie. He's still an infant, he can't be spiderman yet! This movie is just the begging to where we'll see spiderman through madame web which will be on the next seque!"
"Mar 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,Sony why you make a spiderman universe without spiderman this movie is trash like morbius and i dont got hope in the next movies of this universe conclusion trash
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"If you're expecting a full-on Marvel action movie you may be disappointed. However great story, well done, and very enjoyable."
"Mar 5, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I'm actually surprised at the low Critics rating of this film, because I was pretty entertained. Sure, there were some eyerolls at the heavy-handedness with which the 3 girls were portrayed and much of the story was predictable, but at the end of the day it's a superhero movie. It's not Shakespeare, nor does it pretend to be. But it was entertaining and cinematically gorgeous. I'd see it again."
"Mar 5, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed the movie, setting up for future story lines"
"Mar 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,"If you are into cringe ""girl boss"" types of film, this is for you."
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE,This is a great family movie for families with preteens and older. It has action and a great plot. Made a great date night movie.
"Mar 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,Madame Web brings a strong cast that work with a little as they focus more on the cinematography as it's beautiful don't get me wrong but it focuses too much of being a Spider-Man than a Madame Web film and you don't see much of the power abilities which was very frustrating and also same with the superhero costumes as it was less than 5 minutes.
"Mar 5, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I don't understand fans hatred towards female led films. Was there some plot holes, yes, but I found the film enjoyable to watch. It's not the best superhero film, but it doesn't deserve the hate."
"Mar 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie was so awful that I legitimately considered walking out of the theater. Alas I stuck it out and the movie played out exactly as expected. Acting was terrible, almost no action scenes, and very confusing plot and progression. Hilariously bad voiceovers, I thought my ears were playing tricks on me because I thought that there was no way a big time movie studio would just let their product reach theaters in that condition. The writers clearly intended this movie for 2-year-olds considering how much they spoon feed you everything. This makes Morbius look like a must-see."
"Mar 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,What a piece of garbage. The end.
"Mar 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,I don't even want to give it half star....
"Mar 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,At this point sony should give up the spiderman rights after venom 3
"Mar 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,0 star option should specifically made for this movie
"Mar 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The movie was entertaining, however some scenes were not realistic, like stealing the ambulance and no police pursuing, leaving the girls in the woods and thinking they would be there when night falls."
"Mar 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,Didn't see it but it's worse than Morbius
"Mar 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,I did not have high hopes and somehow it still disappointed me.
"Mar 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,Se supone q este de sony sobre Spiderman??
"Mar 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,the villain sounds like somebody who is from the 18th century
"Mar 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,It wasn't written well and the acting did not feel natural
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Dakota Johnson can do no wrong to me.
"Mar 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The truth is that the movie was quite good, I can understand why people criticized it harshly, because while you are watching it what happens with its dejavu scenes and so on makes the movie very confusing and half angry with what is happening, because imagine being Are you the one who tries to capture the dejavu effect for an audience and doesn't know how to do it? I suppose this was the premise for making the movie and its great appeal.... these things are not new in other Marvel movies, you can see these effects of ""how do we show this to the viewer?"" and boom they make a great movie for you, however I think that for the brain in general it was not very nice since it made us feel like fools when watching it for not understanding what is happening and when repeating scenes, it became so repetitive and monotonous that I did not like it In general, that's why the bad reviews, but after finishing watching the movie, if you start to reflect on everything you saw, you understand that everything made a lot of sense, the truth is that it was not an ultra movie like all the other Marvel movies. , but it worked out, it worked out quite well for what it was, it won't be one of the best but it's easily close to a 7/10, to watch it once with popcorn, and leave it there as a source film, I hope they use the characters again in the future ."
"Mar 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,I have never seen a worse movie
"Mar 4, 2024",NEUTRAL,"A great show, I enjoyed it more than expected, a new twist on the usual spider man movies."
"Mar 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web is a wasted potential, with horrible acting, dialogue, editing, cinematography and set up, it fails to bring a great Spider-Man Spin Off Movie that this makes Morbius a Masterpiece."
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"I love it. People just hate this movie , maybe because of the villain and some graphics."
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Madame Web is one of the best moviesI've seen in 2024! The trailer surely doesn't do the movie justice, as it is a bit confusing, but the movies introduction explains everything the trailer for the movie doesn't(who the Spider-man like person is, what is his motives, who are the girls, etc.) I feel like at some points in the movie, it is hard to follow along with what Cassandra's visions are depicting, it is not a big enough issue for the movie to avoid 5 stars. For any Marvel lover who loves the action and thrill of the most recent Sonys Spider-Man trilogy, you are going to LOVE Madame Web!"
"Mar 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie is what being lobotomised must feel like.
"Mar 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was cringe. It didnt even have a great plot line.
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"A true delight! Car theft, mind projection, not knowing how to talk to children, Ben from Parks and Rec still being named Ben here...honestly what more can you want?"
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Great story and nice action. Hope there will be a sequel.
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,It was able to introduce Madame web as a stand alone movie as well as connecting her to the spider man multi verse
"Mar 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,The plot line was cool. The acting and writing were awful. The jokes were so forced. I think it was my least favorite marvel movie to date
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the critics!

WARNING! Minor spoilers ahead.

Madame Web is a very well thought out movie, and pays attention to all the small details. The way it's able to play tricks on the mind with its complex story telling, and how it creates tension and panic with the sounds heard throughout are amazing, and what this movie is best at. Also, speaking of sounds, this movie has some of the best sound design of the decade! It can create so much emotion, and perfectly add on to a scene. Also, I love how this movie is able to create intense emotion, confusion, and wonder in the minds of its audience in a very well executed manner. Most of the visuals are also quite stunning! It's clear that there was a lot of thought put into them. I'm also hyped for the sequels this movie set up at the end, and I hope they're just as good as the first!

This movie is not without its flaws though. For example, at the start of the movie, Ezekiel Sims shoots down the mother of Madame Web because she found a spider she, himself, and other researchers were looking for. While Madame Web's mother wanted to use it for good, and to save her unborn daughter from a disease, Ezekiel wanted it for himself. While the type of spider they found did grant powers, (that's spiders in the Marvel universe 101,) the motives felt somewhat vague. While he did say something about his parents not being listen to when they were starving, (at least that's what I remember, I was a bit tuned out at that time,) it still feels like they could have elaborated a bit more in the rest of the movie. Also, one set in one scene of the movie, the scene where Madame Web found out her mother was good, just looks fake, kind of like something I would see on some ride at Disney that was based of a cartoon. 

Other than that, this movie is outstanding, and I would definitely watch it again. Honestly, I think the only reason critics hate this movie is because it didn't feel very Marvle-like. But for me, someone who likes to go into things with a clear mind and not to many expectations, this wasn't a problem! Madame Web is an amazing movie, and you should 100% go watch it if you haven't!"
"Mar 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,The worst marvel movie
"Mar 4, 2024",NEUTRAL,"We enjoyed this, but the audio voice overs were pretty bad at times. The acting wasn't so great on the part of the main character and villain but everyone else did great."
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Awesome all female cast
"Mar 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,See for yourself 🤷🏻
"Mar 3, 2024",NEUTRAL,A solid movie that introduces the main cast. The villian was very iffy but the girls did their jobs. Nice to see an origin story were they don't actually get their suits yet. Only reason I think it's getting killed in ratingbis the whole all- girl crew and some people don't like that
"Mar 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I think they were confused that this is not 50 Leftovers, if it weren't for the fact that Dakota Johnson has dad and mom working there, she wouldn't get a job, the movie is horrible, time has no logic, it's an involuntary comedy with recycled scenes and a villain without dignity"
"Mar 3, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Well, I like the story from the beginning, but it was turn down sour in the middle and not enough action. The four of the Spider-Man girls character could have put on costume instead of oh yeah, I'm not gonna put a costume during the fight scene."
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Liked it - not what I thought
"Mar 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The villains casting was terrible, his voice didnt set right with me."
"Mar 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,The villain is defeated by literal product placement
"Mar 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The plot was awfully constructed, made no sense and there was less action than a soap commercial. It was rushed, sloppily constructed and the character could do whatever they wanted. The villain only used their assets when it helps the plot and even then this film is so boring. You don't care about the characters and you don't care about the plot. 
Sony you need to stop hiring terrible writers and making terrible films."
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Fascinating Dakota. Beauty and the Beauty
"Mar 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I have never witnessed multiple groups of people leave a movie well before it was over. My group laughed all the way through, still, Madame Web may be the worst movie I've even seen in theatre."
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,I personally injoyed this movie it's look so much better in person then in YouTube shorts it TIK tok
"Mar 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,2 hours of my life gone
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Movie was very good.
"Mar 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,Worst movie I ever watched
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"o filme é totalmente diferente do que os criticos falam ou a audiencia. Provavelmente assistiram o filme com a tela do cinema desligado, se prestar atenção no filme tem uma interligação direta com o universo aranha"
"Mar 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was ok. I'd recommend watching it on streaming services than in a theater.
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Was interesting cant wait for part 2
"Mar 3, 2024",NEUTRAL,Went to see this because seeing for Dune was packed. This wasnt too bad. Its not a movie I would watch a second time.
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie gave it 4 stars cause I wanted more action, but great into story for the 3 young lady characters "
"Mar 2, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Really enjoyed it! Love an origin movie and fun being set in the early 00's with the music and fashion, pre social media!! I think it set up the characters pretty well and I like that they kept the dakota johnson awkwardness but with know it all attitude and had some good funny parts… can't be marvel now without that marvel humour!"
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie has gotten a bad rap.  It was entertaining and kept your interest to see how it ends.  Isn't that what movies are supposed to do.  You didn't have to see all the marvel movies before it to understand parts of the movie.  It could stand alone by itself.  Could have done without all the horror movie previews shown before it.
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,fantastic movie ! I love
"Mar 2, 2024",NEUTRAL,It was alright.  I've seen it and that's enough.
"Mar 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Had good potential but was uneven and confusing.  For example, it kept showing the 3 teens as superheroes with spider-like powers in flash-forward scenes, but at not time does it even attempt to explain where they would get the powers.  And the ending where Cassandra falls into the river and nearly drowns does not explain why she lost her eyesight or ended up in a wheelchair.  Other things that bothered me included the 3 teens in the woods with a campfire that they just abandoned without extinguishing to go to the diner (Smokey would be sad...).  Then there's the dancing on the table at the diner...would doubt that would be allowed by the staff.   The scene at the fireworks warehouse at the start was ludicrous...they would not allow anyone to be that close to it.   And the scenes where they return to the diner all there is to keep people out after it's destroyed is a piece of yellow tape.   Same goes for when they return to the warehouse.  NO guard, anyone can just walk in and mess with all the explosives. And just tossing flares into boxes of fireworks? OMG....so ridiculous.  That entire place would have exploded like a small nuke.  The other major thing that ruins it is that Cassandra is wanted by the cops for attempted kidnapping and attacking cops, yet can drive around NYC in a stolen cab with no plates.  AND then can hop on a plane, fly to South America, and find the same spot where her mother died.  How did she get a passport? How did she get past TSA and on a plane if wanted by the cops?  The movie was so full of things like this that it made it almost unwatchable."
"Mar 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It is obvious that DJ made no effort to show any love for this movie or character. Her promo interviews were terrible. She put as much effort in the character. Nor did the writers, editors or anyone. This movie is not even worthy of its so bad it’s good status. Honestly movie execs are just wanting to piss off fans and give them anything and everything but source material content. As now I am done with comic book movies other than Deadpool 3. Hopefully it’s loaded w source material and fan justice that these idiots in the biz will wake the f up and give us a good comic book movie done right. Utter trash. The 2 minutes of action was in the preview and it was not even real. The Razzies are going to have a field day. "
"Mar 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,Its just a pepsi ad no fun in this
"Mar 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,Занадто багато екшену.
"Mar 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web: Entangled in a Mess
This movie had me more tangled up in confusion than a spider web in a hurricane. The story was all over the place, the characters felt flat, and the dialogue was about as smooth as sandpaper. Even though the visuals were kinda cool at times, it wasn't enough to save the movie from feeling like a big ol' letdown. Skip this one and stick to reruns of your favorite Spider-Man flick instead."
"Mar 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I can't say it's a failure, but it's not the level of Marvel."
"Mar 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"dialogue is horrible, but this movie had so much potential, no clue how it was written and edited so poorly. what a shame"
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie was so enjoyable and rich and fun. The performances were spot-on for this pretty original brand of superhero movie where the real power came from intelligence, strategy and learning calm amid chaos. I hope the totally undue (and in my strong estimation, misogynist) shade people have been throwing this movie gets ignored and that we get a sequel: I want the next chapter. I want to know how the tale of the three girls unfolds. I want more of Cassie’s journey to discover more of the strength and courage her mother left to her that she’s only just begun to learn. Dumb people love a bandwagon— don’t be one of those idiots piling on. This movie is honestly head and shoulders above any of the Marvel movies in recent memory. And definitely a great time at the theater."
"Mar 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"my favorite part is how Ezekiel says a whole sentence and his lips don't move at all. This wasn't even so bad its good it was so bad i want my money back how did they make this move so horrendous. The dialogue is horrible, Cassandra is wanted by the nypd for kidnapping the whole movie and yet still drives the taxi she stole and crashed, and decides to steal an ambulance too. Ezekiel was absolutely horrible, the dubbed audio over him never matched up the entire movie and it was so horrble. My favorite best worst quote ""My spider....they took my spider!!!"""
"Mar 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,The chaotic film rhythm and predictable plot make it difficult to become a good movie.
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,It is a very interesting movie dont go in thinking it is going to be like spiderman and if you do that you should enjoy it. Dakota johnson is good at acting but some parts were off. Good movie though
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the movie a lot and loved the concept. The only issues I have with the movie is that it felt like it didn't have a proper conclusion. I also wanted to see the girls actually use their powers; although, it makes me hope for a part 2. This movie really loves crashing through buildings with a car."
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,Very good action movie!
"Mar 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,Had a lot of great ideas but the writing and acting was cringe the entire movie.
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,It was an origin movie  that exploded the Mythology of Madam Webb  it was great.
"Mar 2, 2024",NEUTRAL,While there were a couple of unnecessary scenes for the origin story and a couple of plot holes (paramedics not delivering a baby?) overall a good movie.
"Mar 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Legitimately the worst movie I've ever seen. I went in thinking it would be bad but funny, but it was just so so bad. I love watching bad movies but couldn't stand this one. Every single character was excruciating to watch. The end was especially bad. Comparisons to The Room are completely accurate."
"Mar 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,I have not even seen this movie but you could already tell from the first trailer it was the worst superhero movie ever 
"Mar 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I took a chance, thinking it couldn't be as bad as the reviews. It was. Horrible acting and a snoozefest.  I gave it a half star for the little twist at the end."
"Mar 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The movie is a piece of shi....
Fine,never mind."
"Mar 2, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Starts off slow but movie picks up. There are parts that are far fetched but it’s a Marvels movie. Not sure they should’ve cast Dakota super hero I did not quite believe it. She’s so dainty. Then really no powers to take on a powerful spider yet dainty Dakota does. However, it does set up for a nice sequel at the end when it is explained. Glad I stayed through it."
"Mar 2, 2024",NEUTRAL,I liked it. Im a mom though so some of the lines from Dakota in the beginning I find myself saying daily. Kind of had some final destination vibes.
"Mar 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"If I could do no stars, I would."
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,Don't listen to the negative reviews. Go see this movie your going to be confused at first at what's going on it gets explained shortly in the film after the train scene the rest of the movie picks up and filled with action and a decent story line. Is this movie a big budget draw dropping marvel action film? No... but I can see the potential.  I respect the originality in this script and the teen girls in the movie weren't trying to do the most and it was refreshing to see Mike epps. He wasn't forced to be a comedian and make corny jokes. Overall this movie is solid enough to watch and recommend.
"Mar 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A Spider-Manless Spider-Man film green lit by misguided Sony executives as part of a weird, disjointed Spider-Man cinematic universe with a lack of Spider-Man. With the quality of a Disney Channel superhero original."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"MW was a Good movie. it was 4 of 5 film, entertaining, enough excitement and some superhero / magic,  Much better than the movie critic's ratings. It's not going to win an Oscar but, ... worth seeing!"
"Mar 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"he visto cosas peores, pero pareció mas un comercial muy largo de Pepsi escrito por chat.gpt"
"Mar 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,Fell asleep during it. 
"Mar 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A film that sets a new low for superhero movies, and even movies in general honestly. There is no entertainment value here; just awful humour, terrible characters, just bad EVERYTHING."
"Mar 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The timeline was all off, Zeke wasn't portrayed anything like how he is in the comics... 'the man who climbed the ceilings' come on now, he's stronger than Spiderman and sacrificed himself... not cool at all! Madame Web was not 80 and had absolutely no emotion. Literally a bunch of teenagers getting into trouble because they don't listen and a few psychic moments (the Chinese though... doh). Do not bother. Why these stand alones keep happening is beyond me. Write it into the actual Spiderman films and it may make sense. Dakota Johnson is not Superhero material. Absolutely pants, watching a Pepsi sign cause so much trouble for 15 minutes was not how I thought I would be spending my night. I'm still trying to work the whole thing out now, 3 days later. It's a no from me!"
"Mar 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,Marvel and Disney has lost there way. The plot was dull and boring. Is Ezekiel having a dream about his death and going after the girls the best they can come up with. Did they even do any screens for this movie?  Wait for Disney+ and play it in the background while you are cleaning
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It kept my interest the entire time.  I can’t  wait for the sequel,  I felt like the cast did an amazing job. I love Dakota Johnson and I watch all of her movies!!"
"Mar 1, 2024",NEUTRAL,Creo fielmente que el público rebajó tanto la película que me termino gustando y interesando más que otras películas de acción. Es lo que pasa cuando no eres pretencioso con tu producto y das lo que prometes si le puse dos estrellas a Dune es porque está hace algo bien una buena introducción para estar enganchado y terminas sin el sentimiento de fatiga.
"Mar 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Much like Madam Web, I foresaw this movie's future when Sony announced it. Luckily, the poor screenwriting and subpar special effects won't distract you from Dakota Johnson's obvious disapproval of starring in this failed franchise attempt."
"Mar 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"In my opinion the cinematography of the film was appalling, the film was boring and the villain was weak, he could have won a thousand times and failed for a bad conclusion"
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"tudo ahaver com os quadrinhos, ela é uma cega que da conselhos ao homem aranha,
nao faz parte da açao, e o filme tem toda logica 
muito bom"
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,It was a good movie. A movie not connected to the same universe as Spiderman nor Venom or Morbius nor Kraven.
"Mar 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Webb Initial Reaction  

Score: 40% ❌🍅

1. This film is hilarously terrible

2. Sydney Sweeney could not save it

"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great Great Great Movie, I want another one. Stop listening to these judgy people that don't ever like anything good."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"Amazing Movie, ya'll need to stop hating. Every time a movie that involves females with powers or as a super hero ya'll give it low rating. Stop hating and appreciate a movie. like what harm is it doing to you, ya'll ain't the ones paying to make the movie, and for the first movie, it was actually really good, good action, good graphics. Even Marvel themselves have made some very bad movies. I give this movie 5 stars being honest."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Movie was freaking amazing idky people are being haters giving it low ratings. My family and I loved it.
"Mar 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It's time to stop, Disney. It's time to stop."
"Mar 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This was a bad movie.  I cannot decide which was worse this or Morbius.  Ultimately, I blame the writers and director for this throw away superhero movie."
"Mar 1, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie is absolutely epic! I hope they make a second one. My friend and i are seeing it again tomorrow! Excellent job
"Feb 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I wasnt a fan of this movie, terrible awful movie"
"Feb 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,So bad it's good but even that becomes strenuous. The lack of effort put into the filmmaking is unbelievable. To say the acting is phoned-in is generous. No one involved with any aspect of this disaster seemed to remotely care.
"Feb 29, 2024",NEUTRAL,6/10 so bad it's fun
"Feb 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,Should have showed the action first instead of the origin that would ruined the movie
"Feb 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The ""meh, it passed the time"" prompt from Rotten Tomatoes is pretty accurate in this case. I actually found myself enjoying the movie outside of the awful Ezekiel Sims ADR debacle. Yes, it is not great and there were some questionable choices made, like WHY Dakota Johnson and WHY so much choke slamming (amongst other things), but I do not think it's too far off movies like The Flash, Shazam 2, or Quantumania, to name some contemporaries that have been notably bad. I am not sure why Sony keeps putting all this money and effort into trying to create a Spiderman universe without putting some brains behind it too. 
There is a lot wrong with this movie but I did find it mildly entertaining so that must count for something."
"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE,It was not that bad😭
"Feb 29, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Despite the hate from everyone, i think this movie is ok for me, decent script"
"Feb 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web is awful, laughable, and tiresome. I think it's the worst comic book movie I've seen this year."
"Feb 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,The movie didn't make any sense and it a waste of time
"Feb 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,"No stars would be a great option. 
Just like getting your money back after a terrible movie would be great , or realizing that someone wrote a terrible script and maybe you should read it before greenlighting something just for the sake of making a movie with popular actors. 
The only saving grace is they never said spidermans name , the universe doesn't feel quite so tainted."
"Feb 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,ham........... its good for time pass
"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"Although it ends more with a thud than a bang, I enjoyed the movie's novel departure from typical super-character/Marvel flicks. Dakota's laid-back style is perfect (she did NOT ""call it in""); and the rest of the cast did fine. The story line was interesting and easy to follow, and moves spiritedly along. Far better than the average critics' rating suggests."
"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"After hearing not so good things, I didn't know what to expect. Honestly, I loved it. I think if you payed attention the whole movie you got the whole story. The person I went to see it with, didn't understand the story. I felt like it was described perfectly and I am excited to watch it again!"
"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE,Don't believe the bad reviews.  This movie has a great storyline.
"Feb 29, 2024",POSITIVE,this movie is definitely watchable. it is not as bad as the critics make it out to be. just as good as godzilla minus one - imho
"Feb 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was pretty bad and not very well made
"Feb 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,I really wanted to like it but the dialogue was absolutely terrible. I liked the story and I think if they tried they could've made a very cool movie.
"Feb 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This was extremely disappointing for many reasons, especially the fact that we haven't had a spider-man based movie in so long and we got a not even half-baked ""film"" with annoying characters and a plot that's falling apart throughout the movie."
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,I only wish i could have those 2 hours of my life back
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,"❌26%

I agree.

Yeah, it's bad. Like, really bad. I'm not even sure what to call it. A fan-made movie?  A bad idea? Poorly executed? I'm not even sure if I can call it a train wreck, because a train wreck at least has something that draws people to it. This has nothing. It's disastrous execution, with a terrible script and bad dialogue. The performances aren't all that great, but the villain stands out as 1. one of the worst villain performances in the past few years, and 2. one of the worst villains in comic book movie history. Chukwuji Iwuji eats this guy alive. Dakota Johnson is fine and my guy Adam Scott is always fun!

This film doesn't seem like it exists. I don't know how to explain. It seems like a Frankenstein experiment from the 2000s' that was put in a drawer, went rotten, and has now been revealed to the world. There are some plot points that eat 15-20 minutes of the film that serve no actual purpose. And finally, the visual choices here are baffling. The costumes are laughable, the CGI is… not good, and the editing! What was that!? The cuts, weird and unnecessary camera turns, everything was wrong. The last 10 minutes are special… just special…

Great way to start the year.

Long live Madam Mommy.

It's worst that Morbius."
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Possibly one of the worst films I’ve ever seen. Dakota was the only good part about the movie. But it did her a disservice. I don’t think I’ve ever rated a movie as low as this. Normally, I like to spend some time talking about the movie. This one it’s just not worth it."
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,NOTHING NEWWWWW  BOOOOORING
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,"(Contains spoilers!!) I'm actually not sure where to start. The trailers built up some action-packed fiasco that I didn't get to see in the theater. The plot had a tendency to go painfully slow, then there would be several fast developments, then it went back to being painfully slow. If you're going to see Sydney Sweeny as a superhero (the reason I went, because it was so heavily advertised), DON'T. The young girls don't actually become their superhero personas AT ALL in the entire film. There is one scene we get to see them in action, but it is a ""flash-forward"" to a time that apparently exists after the credits roll. Aside from the terrible plot, the aspect that threw me off the most was the dialogue. Sloppy dubbing (for no apparent reason) combined with poor phrasing choices, annoying cliches, and just flat out bad grammar made any character a pain to listen to. Dakota Johnson even hinted in a few interviews that this isn't the best film she's participated in, however she seems to have done the best with what she was given. Here are a few rants I have about the film:

- In the opening scene when we are introduced to Cassie's mother and the main villain, the plot isn't just predictable and cliche, it's just flat out ridiculous. Firstly, the actions of the main villain, Ezekiel, just seem so dramatic to me. Like m*rdering a pregnant woman… for a spider he could have easily taken out of her hand? To later be driven mad with a want to k*ll literal KIDS because of a nightmare he had?? Maybe I'm being overly cynical, but that was bizarre. Also, the entrance and the entire presence of the unexplained native tribe (that supposedly runs the island spiders or something?) in this scene was just too random for me. We hardly got any context there at all.

- In the scene with the fire where one of Cassie's coworkers d*es in an accident involving an ambulance, I almost started laughing because it was such a slow, dramatic scene where (I think?) we were meant to feel sad for the death of a random character we didn't even know. I believe the idea was not to feel sad for the character himself, rather the situation, and that Cassie could have prevented his death. However, it was executed so badly I fear it didn't achieve that point. 

- There is a way for a director to show an audience that the main character doesn't know what's going on. However, Clarkson apparently felt the need to show us over, and over, and over again that Cassie didn't understand the time-jumps she was experiencing. It got so monotonous and repetitive I feel it took up way too much time in the film, and I got physically agitated.

- Did anyone else think that the villain was a little outrageous? We never saw his transformation, there was no explanation of his end-game or his goals, only that he really didn't wanna die and wanted to have ""cool powers"" I guess? In the start of the film, he seemed to be a researcher driven to madness by some intense want to attain the sought-after spider for its abilities. Years later he just sort of reappeared as a billionaire with a cool spider-suit, spider-man like abilities, technology decades ahead of its time, and an mission to k*ll three CHILDREN who may or may not cause him some trouble ten years in the future I just felt his entire character was so odd, for lack of a better word. Also, back on the whole dialogue thing, what was up with the way he spoke?? All of his lines sounded AI-generated and badly badly dubbed. 

- The cheap knockoff of ""with great power comes great responsibility"" had me writhing in my seat. Like what was that!??!! Just so cringe. 

In conclusion, part of me is upset I spent money and time to give this a shot. Another part of me is glad I did so I can join the large online community of Madame Webb haters."
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Without the banter between Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, and Celeste O'Connor this movie is not watchable. The ladies provide comedy, heart and and feel good moments but other than that, the movie gives nothing.
The villain is as one dimensional as they come. Horrible dialogue and delivery of it.
The suit designs were nice however all you saw in the trailer is basically all you get in the film. 
Unpopular opinion but I would love to see the ladies in a sequel because now that they have been established, it could promise more of the good aspect of this film."
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,no digo que es lo peor en vestuario o adaptaciones pero todo es pésimo tanto en aspecto de los personajes como guion es un asco lo único rescatable son las actuaciones de ciertos actores me salí de la sala de cine a media función y después por otros medios de resumen mire el final y si es malísima
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,Esse filme é um lixo! Trailler enganoso e totalmente sem conteúdo!
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Terrible, worse spiderman movie I've ever seen."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"People on the internet love hating on things. This movie is a perfect example for that - if I hadn't known about the hate this movie got, I would have completely enjoyed this movie which had a lot of Spiderman 1 vibes. But even with that knowledge this movie was entertaining and made me wanna watch more. 

Dear internet, please take a deep breath."
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Y bueno, creo que lo peor fue haber gastado el precio de la entrada en vez de irme a comer"
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,"WHY?
WHY?
WHY?
WHY?
WHY?"
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Concept = Brilliant, Execution = Awful.
I had high hopes for a Dakota Johnson led superheroish movie. I think the editing of this movie is awful. Had the director spliced together the scenes differently, a totally different movie could have come out of this, a good one! Half the scenes just aren't necessary. There are a few brilliant scenes (The subway, the diner). Im not sure why this movie is set in 2003, other then to have Toxic playing on the radio conveniently. If that's the reason, ill accept it, because when Toxic came on it really elevated that entire scene!
The prologue for this movie could have just been skipped...and should have been Dakota Johnson falling into the river. The prologue is lightly replayed later in the movie and could have just been heavily featured at this point, elevating the mid movie scenes far better. 
Ultimately the payload for the entire concept is burnt up early on in the movie. Unfortunately this movie is subject to dumbing down so lazy viewers can follow it without question, rather then watching along with intrigue.
I will say this for it....I hate prequels...so if this can act as the prequel to a much larger overall story, then Im in for more!"
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web, the latest addition to the superhero genre, falls short of spinning a captivating tale that resonates with audiences. Despite its potential for exploring intriguing themes and introducing a lesser-known character from the Marvel universe, the film struggles to weave a compelling narrative and engage viewers on a deeper level."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"10/10.  Must see for marvel fans.  My favorite of the marvel series.  Strong female leads.  Very positive message and theme on the importance of love and being family to one another whether biological or not.  This is a fantastic movie for the whole family. The plot was complicated and engaging. The whole time the actors were fantastic, to make such an engaging movie with almost all new unknown actors is a difficult task.  All of the actors do a fantastic job, and the acting of the roles is convincing. 

The settings were beautiful and the motives and plot believable …as far as movies go.  
My children range between 12 and 20 years old and are big marvel fans, therefore I see a lot of marvel movies. This is in my top three marble favorites, along with Iron Man and Captain America.

This movie has my mind spinning and wondering how it connects to the multi-verse and if there's any connection to Spider-Man.  The main characters real life work partner is named Ben Parker… could there be any relation to other parkers? We don't learn any other names in the movie.. so why is this name mentioned a few times..

Weakness: For me, one movie weakness is the cinematography on the driving, an action scenes, or when there is a premonition… The video movement and angles didn't make sense. It kept spinning us in circles with blurry images. Those parts were done terrible.  I want to see great scenes during action that are clear and that physiologically makes sense, I want to move with the vehicle, and not feel like the cameras hanging from a rope spinning in a circle.

Pro: one of the best marvel movies.
-beautiful major theme of family and creating family.
-no language or romantic scenes. 
- great for whole family
-Ended the show wanting more and looking forward to a sequel.

Cons: action scenes were filmed in a blurry circular motion. How does driving a car down in New York St. get filmed with a camera spinning in circles???  

Why so many blurry images of action scenes?  In this day and age action scenes should be crystal clear.

10/10 overall."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"Wow. One of the best Super-Hero movies I've ever seen.
Madam Web starts with an amazing story of a heavily pregnant mother searching in the amazon for a cure for her unborn daughter, a cure that needs venom from a very rare spider.
Due to her being critically injured she dies but her daughter survives to become a paramedic living in new york who loves her job but is bitter about being an orphan and doesn't want a husband or children.
But, thanks to sharing a connection with spider-folk, she discovers 3 teenage girls in danger of being murdered by the same man who killed her mother.
Using her newly developed power to see the near future she embarks on a cat and mouse battle to protect the girls whilst trying to find out why she's so connected to them.
Some of the best scenes are her trying to deal with 3 typically unrully teens. The movie is a lot of fun and makes the most of it's best ideas. Strong recommended."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"Holy Moly! this might be one of the greatest films I have EVER seen I literally morbed in the theater. Don't be surprised when Madame Web wins every Oscar this year. It is exciting and adventurous, the main character of Madame Web is so good, and the villain Ezekiel Sims is more impressive and well-acted than Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight. It even beats out some of the greatest movies of all time, like The Godfather, or Justice League (2017), even though not quite as good as the masterpiece that is Morbius. Sony, you better make a crossover happen!! 5/5 must-watch for the best movie of the century."
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,Train wreck of a movie. So bad it's almost comical.
"Feb 28, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I know everyone is hating on this, my son included, but I don't care - I liked it anyway. I've been wanting a low-stakes superhero movie, and this gave it to me. I thought the girls were fun, as was Cassie's irritation with them. I liked how Cassie figures out how to deal with and use her newfound abilities."
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Sony…..for the love of God, stop making these movies, and sell the Spidey rights to Disney."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie has a very cheesy early 2000s Marvel Movie vibe, it's a stylistic choice. While some dialogue is a bit clunky, the movie is never really boring. A lot of creative decisions were made and they landed pretty well. Coming into this movie with an open mind is the best way to view it. It's a good time and definitely worth a couple rewatches."
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,"My brother fell asleep, he said he took a 6 dollar nap, and the best part about the movie was the slurpee. That movie was so bad it hurt my heart."
"Feb 28, 2024",NEUTRAL,It was a very entertaining movie. Just don’t mind the loopholes in editing. It’s not as bad as some people think.
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,Sony really doesn’t know how to manage the marvel IP. Really poor movie.
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"This was an awesome movie. Good cast, Good story and it went along with the comic book. I definitely would see it again."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was really good, I expected to not like it because that seemed to be the trend but it was actually good. It mainly focused on introducing madame web and how she came to be. Might not be your movie if you have a short attention span."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"I liked the story line, the tie in with Spiderman, most of the acting was good. Mostly exciting, only a little predictable. Great ending."
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,Possibly the worst movie of all time. Feel bad for the three spiderwoman that didn't even get to be spiderwoman. I believe the writers for this movie were high off tranquilizers when they wrote it.
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,Go into this movie open minded!!!
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,There are (very) few moments where it is watchable. 
"Feb 28, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Don't understand all the hate tbh. It wasn't anything mind-blowing, but there's been worse super-hero movies."
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie was actually very good, the bad reviews really don’t make sense. I’d suggest seeing it for yourself to decide and try not to fall into anything you might have seen online. Of course, all superhero movies can be a bit silly at times, but this was well written, has a good story line, and was fun. Maybe some people just don’t enjoy an all female led cast, or forgot that this is in the same universe as magic spiders that bite people and give them powers. This movie is entertaining, plain and simple. Just go into it with no expectations, good or bad, and try to take it for what it is, a superhero movie."
"Feb 27, 2024",NEUTRAL,Took awhile to find out her powers. And still kind of left of left that question  open. Need a sequel to pull it all it together and put Madame X on the map. As well as the other three.
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,wonderful film best possible story and ending with promising very good sequel
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,Madame Web i had low low expectations but i gotta give it an 8 out of 10 for someone with epilepsy and experiences ￼déjà vu ￼right before having a seizure it was cool to see that incorporated as a super power lmao 🤣 it had a decent story line and a lot of easter eggs that i noticed from the spider-man cartoon that we grew up with like her friend Ben “uncle” his house in the movie resembled aunt May’s house in the cartoon and a few other ones ￼￼
"Feb 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,Waste of time! Worst super hero movie ever.
"Feb 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,"You'll be bored for the first 30 minutes, but then you'll laugh out loud at how badly the script is written."
"Feb 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,Absolutely terrible movie!
"Feb 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It's a movie with an interesting concept, executed in the worst ways possible. Decent Action and a solid main character can't save a formulaic script, terrible dialogue, and ridiculous character decisions"
"Feb 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,"To be frank this movie was very bad. The filming style gave twilight vibes, the lines timing was horrible, there was no actual backstory and or one that made sense. This movie should've never hit the big screen. Not only did casting mix and mash bad actresses, trendy actresses with low caliber skills regarding acting. The budget must've went to the beyonce mural, Pepsi and Mountain Dew advertisements within the movie."
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,I liked it sure it needed a bit more . like how the 3 get   there powers and which peter parker it is . other then that My friend and i saw it and we agreed it was good but needed more
"Feb 27, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I thought it was a solid movie - not great, but very good. I would absolutely watch it again!"
"Feb 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,Really bad movie..... Madam web is dumb
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie loved it
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,"es una pelicula que se deja ver con diversion, fui con mi pareja y realmente la disfrutamos. Hay que tener en cuenta que no es una peli marvel 100x100 pero realmente fue agradable de ver."
"Feb 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Worst Marvel ever. DC getting a good laugh here. It seemed like Dakota Johnson didn’t even want to be in the movie.  There was no emotion whatsoever, no excitement, no suspense, nothing. The best part for me was realizing that the baby was Peter Parker."
"Feb 27, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Was interesting to watch, but Didnt like ending of movie."
"Feb 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It held my attention... But that may have been because of the really bad ADB dubbing of the Villan's lines or the fact that Dakota Johnson cannot show any other emotion except sarcasm and that is even stretching it. Our 3 ""teenagers"" could have been a good segway into the spiderverse but unfortunately this movie was so bad I don't think it will make it to any screenwriters desk. It's a toss-up on if this or Morbius was worse. I vote this had more action but Morbius had better actors."
"Feb 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,Not a good movie.  Wasted my time and money.  Disappointed.
"Feb 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,Horrendous movie. I thought I was watching a lifetime channel movie.
"Feb 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,Rubbish from start to end
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great movie, especially if you got little ladies in your life."
"Feb 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,What is most apparent when watching this movie is nobody involved wanted to make it or cared about the final product.
"Feb 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,"While Madame Web is a much weaker superhero movie than Morbius, I was honestly expecting something much more remarkably awful. If anything, it's just really boring without some of Morbius's redeeming qualities such as some decent ideas that could've been more thought-provoking in a better film and a villain whose actor seemed to be having a blast playing him. I suppose Madame Web has some slightly good points. Dakota Johnson's performance was better-than-expected given her comments about acting against blue screen and reacting to thin air and there're some good stunts from Evil Spider-Man but on the whole, I still remained baffled why Sony is insisting on not just making this universe dedicated to Spider-Man characters without Spider-Man a thing but trying to exploit the multiverse's current mainstream popularity to actively trick people into thinking these are MCU films. And you know they've dropped the ball hard when conspiracy theories are being tossed around about how the actors are being manipulated into thinking they're going to join the Avengers only for it to not be the case. The film has a very outdated feel even without the period piece trappings coming off as a glorified fan film, the poorly-dubbed villain is given no personality and his entire motivation can be boiled down to ""he had a bad dream"", the visual effects have a very ""We have Doctor Strange at home"" feel to them, the way the titular character's powers work isn't explored adequately and feels more like a glorified easy way out and I guess I should discuss the big thing: the product placement. Given all the Pepsi memes surrounding this film, I was expecting the film to stop dead in its tracks to extol the virtues of this soft drink and talk about how only non-chads drink Coca-Cola. When all it amounted to was an unintentional example of rule of three. I suppose it's glaring in the climax's location but I think product placement in a Sony film has pretty much peaked with The Emoji Movie. Okay, Mountain Dew is owned by the same company but not everybody knows that. You'd think they'd at least use the opportunity to promote Pepsi Classic or something, however, since Pepsis in this film are manufactured and distributed by time-travelers apparently due to the Pepsis being from 2023 rather than how they looked in 2003. BTW, I don't think the early 2000's settings added anything of note and could've been set in the 2020's without any meaningful changes. Oh wait, it turns out there is a reason why it's set in 2003 and it's for Sony to shamelessly gaslight people who don't do their research into thinking this is an MCU film. You'll know it when you see it...even though once you do the math, you realise the scene in question should've been set earlier. Yep, Madame Web is really bad - and lies to you! - and I can see why some higher-up at Sony had little faith in the project as evidenced by the spoileriffic trailer - though the superhero genre's struggles over the past two years certainly haven't helped - and it forces me to declare one thing: help us, Deadpool & Wolverine, you're our only hope."
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,I think it was really good. I would love to see another installment!
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie was great if you are prepared to see something slow paced once you get past that its a great movie to enjoy
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,I heard so many bad reviews about it. I decided to see it for myself. I loved it!
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,Everything was good I get it
"Feb 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,"the worst movies are always the ones with promise that end up a jumbled disaster. point the finger where you like - audience expectations, casting, writing, directors vision, editing - whatever you can blame you should, because it was all wrong. dakota johnson was a one level performer showing little to no depth or complexity jumping disconnectedly from boring and bland to world wise saviour. the girls were better in a they did the best they could with what they had way. the technical aspects were messy and middle school caliber. the story line dragged and then wrapped up weirdly quickly. 
should have been handed over to marvel(they should be ashamed to even be associated with this) and made into a streaming series."
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,"A montagem tem alguns problemas, o roteiro se perde um pouco, mas eu consegui me divertir com as piadas, realmente entrei na história, então gostei é um bom filme."
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the movie and DAKOTA JOHNSON acting was AMAZING! Hope there's a second movie. 🍿
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,It started slow. After all characters were established the movie was very enjoyable. All the characters except the villains were perfect. Not sure why this movie is getting bad reviews.  Is it end game? No . But it was better than average
"Feb 27, 2024",NEUTRAL,"There were some good parts, but the ending got really cheesy and it isnt something Id watch again."
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,It was better than I expected (granted that I went to see the movie with very low expectations).
"Feb 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This is a scam, a spiderverse mivie withour spiderman, a superhero movie without superheroes, anothe failure, sad."
"Feb 27, 2024",NEUTRAL,"A decent popcorn flick with some moments of genuine hilarity. 
Listen: we arent looking for the second coming of cinema. We know what these movies are gonna do. 
This was entertaining, brought together some charming young actors, and provided an interesting back story for a character that doesnt get much love."
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,"A real movie lover not another side of anything else.... This movie is ok ..  yes a lot to like and dislike... Yes a lot of other whatever mess Hollywood is going thru .. but movie story telling wise... Yes they are learning and understanding...even tho acting of young actress in a few scenes were cringe worthy ...other then yes plot holes ...and blah blah blah.... Who cares cause story wise ... It's like blue beetle worthy of a movie .... And further movies as long as Hollywood stops throwing in all the other dumb nonsense ...like super powers for everyone.... Without actual realistic BS story line ...  Like grandma flies a Space ship in blue beetle etc... sorry about two blue beetle mentions.. but these movies are hurt cause of other things then actual movie stuff .. they ok... Not like VLACK ADDAM,ETERNALS, AND ETC .   U REAL SUPPOSEDLY CRITICS..... Just follow the crowed.. to anyone who likes Super Hero Movies ...this is one."
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"Loved it, dont understand all the hate."
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,Madame Web was Awesome!!!
"Feb 26, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Done right it had so much potential. It's pretty blatant that they were hoping this would be a multi film endeavour so thought they'd keep something back for more films. Unfortunately this film needed the fan service the trailer promised. The actors didn't have much chemistry and while Dakota Johnson did her best, there's only so much you can do with what she was given. It's a shame because Madame Web is an awesome character and if Spiderverse has shown us anything, it's that people love these universes and there's so many stories and characters to work with. More enjoyable than Morbius, less so than Venom."
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the storyline and loved Dakota Johnson as Madame Webb! I liked that she uses her mind not brawn to get the job done. I would have liked the movie to have been longer. Hopefully there will be a sequel. How do the girls get their powers? I and my wife both really enjoyed it.
"Feb 26, 2024",NEUTRAL,"A good movie, but very predictable.  definitely not the terrible movie many are saying it is.  Go have a good time with this one."
"Feb 26, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Not the best marvel, MCU movie. But it is nice to watch as a solo movie, wich not all MCU movie's are."
"Feb 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was honestly boring and uneventful. The acting was terrible.
"Feb 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Jo and I went to see this movie last Friday 23 after reading the large number of dreadful reviews. Neither of us are fans of these Super Hero movies that seem to be what the majority of cinema goers like most. There are plenty of them being shown (and made) and we both find them hard to understand. However, they past the time and we both enjoy hearing the audience scream and clap and all seem to thoroughly enjoy them.  They do, we both admit, pass a couple of hours plus away.

I like to read the reviews of all movies we see, before we actually watch them at our local cinema.  Therefore, we went with very low expectations.

However, neither of us thought it was as bad as the feared. Although, if I was a Super Hero fan I would have given it a one star. There was very little super hero action. Even the final battle at the end was almost a yawn. 

The plot was the best past but was not written or acted well.  The villain was just not villainous enough and how many times can you feel horrified and frightened at a man crawling upside down on a ceiling?

The heroine wasn't a super hero yet and certainly didn't act as one.  She appeared more a s a mother figure protecting three very silly and whining teenagers who were apparently in the future going to become spiderwomen. Why they were picked was not explained. If it was it passed us by.

We are being kind, I suppose in giving it 2.1/2 starts out of five, because the story was so dreadful. It could and should have been a lot better and the acting looked as if they couldn't believe what they were actually saying.  However, that is no excuse. I well remember one of the great actors of my time point to Hammer King, Christopher Lee.  He made even the worst dialogue in the world sound like Shakespeare. 

Our new aspiring actors should take note.

Go with an open mind to see Madame Web. The first half an hour of the movie is the best. 

Oh, one last thing.  The awful villain (his acting he certainly wasn't frightening) had to have had his voice over-dubbed. Most times it didn't match his lips. That was very annoying. But, then so was the dialogue he had to voice."
"Feb 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,"If you take it at face value it was a good movie. However the commercials lead you to believe it was more of a superhero movie and it wasn't that. Fell short. 
Entire movie could have been reduced down into a few sentences. Liked the cast though."
"Feb 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,Not as bad as critics are saying but not good other. Villain was extremely weak and underdeveloped.
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"While not a great film, I liked it better than most reviews would suggest. It had a good story, a good popcorn movie. Acting was okay considering the dialog was not especially well written."
"Feb 26, 2024",NEUTRAL,I genuinely had a good time watching Madam Web with my son. It's not a ground breaking top 10 superhero movie of all time but I don't think that's a bad thing. There's less cringe than I expected and better acting than I expected. It's a fun origin style comic book movie.
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,entertaining movie🤷🏻 typical superhero movie
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"LOVED THE MOVIE ,I AM HOPING THERE IS A SECOND ONE  ...."
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie, amazing acting and overall an exciting film. Would pay thousands of dollars just to see it for the first time again!"
"Feb 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,this was absolutely horrible. disaster.
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,I thought the movie was quite good and the roles were played well. I do believe the lack of ratings is due to the dislike of this being a female dominance film. A recommended watch from me
"Feb 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The boring, the bad , and the bate and switch!. I'd rather watch Encino man on repeat. I'd rather watch grass grow in the desert or stare at the sun...."
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,Love it!!   I can’t wait to see the next one 🙌⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"Me and my brother loved it. I understand that some people aren't going to like some bad dialogue and some bad voiceover work for the main villain. Other than that we really loved this movie. Especially if you grew up watching early 2000's comic book adaptations.( CATWOMAN, Daredevil, and the first two FANTASTIC FOUR movies) I think you will really enjoy it."
"Feb 26, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Mid, but better than Morbius. Looking forward to part II"
"Feb 26, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I'm pretty lenient when it comes to movies. 
As long as I had a good time and enjoyed myself, I approve of the movie.  And I enjoyed this movie.  It wasn't ground breaking, but, for me, it was a good movie about the origin story of Madame Web.  And I'm looking forward to a progression of this story."
"Feb 26, 2024",NEUTRAL,I think people forgot what the average SONY quality is. I just watched the movie and figured out that when it just released EVERYONE WAS CAPPING letting a bunch of bottom feeders talk about how terrible this movie was. For a Sony movie it's average not even the worse movie ever made. I thought the same when I watched Morbius how EVERYONE was capping about how that was the worst movie ever made. I have seen movies WORST THAN THESE MOVIES. I HAVE SEEN SUPERHERO & HERO MOVIES WORSE THAN THESE 2 MOVIES. THE FACT THAT other people think Madame Web & Morbius are the worse SUPERHERO or Hero movies proved that the average person is not into movies. They don't like trying new movies cause they never seen an actual horrible SUPERHERO or HERO movie if they think that both Morbius & Madame Web are the worse movies ever. I recommend watching both when you're bored.
"Feb 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,I walked in with hope that this was a good movie. I was wrong.
"Feb 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,Disney is killing Marvel
"Feb 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It was buns bad rescue and CPR bad writing and bad actors
L"
"Feb 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not what you expected the trailer is very deceiving. The movie is underwhelming and doesn't have really any action/fighting that you would expect it to. No costumes (besides antagonist), and doesn't really feel like a superhero movie."
"Feb 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,Feels like this should be on the CW network.
"Feb 26, 2024",NEUTRAL,The movie was pretty enjoyable. I liked the mystery/suspense direction instead of the standard super hero format. It was better than a lot of them stuff Marvel's been putting out lately.
"Feb 26, 2024",NEUTRAL,Not as bad as everyone made it seem to be. Not the best but entertaining nonetheless.
"Feb 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,"That movie was the worst movie ive ever watched. Everything was bad the dialogue was terrible acting was trash the characters were either unlikeable or one dementional. Horrible pacing worst ending of a marvel movie it was absolute brainrot. It was all prologue and so little climax.  Editing was horrible, I felt like I was tweaking in the cinema. The reason why I gave it a half star was because the people laughing in the background were like a laughtrack, which was funnier than the actual movie. Longest two hours of my life, Marvel should have saved the 100 million dollars and never made this garbage."
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"Eu gostei do filme ao contrário dos outros, esse é um filme de origem da Madames Teia, igual foi o primeiro Homem Aranha do Tobey Maguire. Depois outros filmes virão para se conectar com esse. Tudo precisa ter uma explicação de origem para o público no geral possa entender, até mesmo pra quem não acompanha os quadrinhos."
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie was actually pretty good. I understand why other people would think it's bad, but in reality, it's not that bad. Don't let other reviews persuade you, it's just from their experience. :-)"
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was okay some parts the video just moved too fast , the storyline was predictable, but enjoyable."
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"Me resultó entretenida, pocos efectos especiales  pero muy bien colocados y gran ingenio de la realización, emotiva  y divertida por momentos, a mí gusto un tanto larga la intro y el desenlace un poco apresurado. No decepciona y hasta nos trae un poco a los comienzos menos ostentoso de un Marvel que fue glorioso."
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,Nicely webbed story.
"Feb 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,OMG. Why was this film made?
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,Did not meet or even come close to expectations. Left within 1st hour.
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,NO me parece que la trama este bien
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie was horribly written and the acting seemed as if they all just got out of acting class. Thumbs down. Waste of money.
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,This was a great movie despite the low budget.
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,Very confusing plot with no direction to lead into future movies.
"Feb 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Como origen del personaje creo que está bien contado, podría haber sido mejor, pero no es mala película"
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Yes.  This movie is dumb and cheesy.  BUT!  Let's be real here, so is every other Marvel movie.  I walked out of this movie with the same impression I walked out of every other Marvel movie with - well, that was dumb but still somewhat enjoyable.  And I don't care what anyone says, this movie is not as bad as Morbius.

With all that being said, there isn't actually that much to LIKE about this movie.  The characters are annoying, it often feels like a cut-rate hospital drama show, Tahar Rahim gave an absolutely terrible performance, and the same thing just kind of happens again over and over again in this film. 

This isn't a good movie.  But it's not one of the worst movies of all time.  It's just a movie about a C-tier superhero from a movie studio trying to milk its franchise rights absolutely bone dry.  I will surely put it on in the background while I stare at my phone and occasionally glance up and have a vague sense of enjoyment from the experience."
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"I went in expecting it to be poor, so I kept noticing throughout the film how much I was enjoying it. There was a point near the end where it took a turn for the worse - not bad enough to spoil the film, but might leave people with a lasting negative impression."
"Feb 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,"B Movie. Actually corny at times. Hey, Marvel. Even the best of them are allowed a lemon now and then."
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"I actually love Marvel's Madame Web movie. 🍿 I was thoroughly invested from start to finish and liked the story. Love her superpowers, which are basically her gifted mind and intellect, instead of the usual brute force. What a breath of fresh air. The movie is thrilling and thriller has always been my favourite genre. Loved it! 🫰🏻"
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"It’s not Spider-Man, so don’t think it is and you’ll enjoy it."
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,i think it was amazing yea movie was kinda confusing or people  may not like it and they didnt get their powers yet but man just wait for madame web 2 they will get their powers and we will have more than just a story going on this movie to me was good very good i love marvel and sony films but people need to have respect that they dont have to make anything to earn money or make them watch the marvel films i didnt even have to make spider man tom hollands spider man have the og spidermans in them like just be glad that they are trying their best to make the movie the way they want them
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,i genuinely liked this movie. i thought it was insanely cool and epic. don’t understand the hate.
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,It felt rushed and there wasnt enough real action
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,Fairly good movie. Doesn't follow the comic but haven't read that so no worries. Not a film to watch if you want your thoughts and feelings challenged but a solid piece of escapism with a possible sequel. Critics really overthink these things.
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,I genuinely liked the film. I'm sad that there are so many bad reviews but personally I thought it was good.
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"Pretty cool action female spider man movie. The nitpick I have with it I'd the main girl being an a-hole to the girls. But I understand she's trying to protect them. Other then that, the movie was actually pretty good. Although I was not expecting people to be harsh on it"
"Feb 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Nowhere near as bad as I've been hearing. Went in with low expectations so that may have helped it.
But I got into it and thought the premonition scenes were well executed.
I think a lot of the bad press comes from people that may have a problem with female superheroes.
Obviously not a great movie, but one I'm glad I went to see.
My 2 marvel obsessed daughters were keen before release but were put off by the bad press it received. I think they would enjoy it."
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,Another poorly-written DEI masterpiece from Hollywood.
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"Good movie , don’t understand the bads reviews "
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"I genuinely enjoyed this movie although there were some parts that annoyed me. The voiceover for the main villan, Ezikiel, was very annoying. The voice for him genuinely upset me and kinda threw off the whole movie. The CGI was relatively good during this movie. I cringed at this movie a few times but other than that I genuinely cried and laughed at this movie. It had a good plot, and decent acting. The way the actors portrayed their characters was very well thought out. Another thing that upset me was the ending, although it was good. Ezikiel at the end, against Cassie, didnt put up much of a fight. I believe if they would've continued the fight a little bit more and gave Ezikiel a proper outing, then it would've been so much better. At the end, Cassie becomes blind and has adopted the three girls. We get a look in to the future and see how they really are, and I enjoyed that little peak of them. Although, Cassie being blind near the end kinda made no sense. (Keep in mind I havent read the comics, if there is one) Her being blind and still being able to fight upset me, only because it would've been so much better if the mentor of the three girls could fight alongside them instead of a ""hologram"" or a fake Cassie alongside them. Her being able to tell the future is definitely strong, but being blind and still being able to tell it, is kinda of weird to me.

Overall, this movie was definitely great with some cons, but all movies have cons. I would definitely recommend it to people who haven't seen much Spider Superhero movies, and would I watch it again."
"Feb 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It was good, I do wish they made the ending better. Seemed like they ran out of time and just wanted to fill what was left of the movie with a pretty basic ending… also she has superpowers from healing spiders…. So how is she blind and paralyzed at the end. Definitely a mistake on the directors part"
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie is so trash. The story is very bad and sometimes it doesn't even make sense. Even the voice lines were sometimes confusing, like reallly confusing. It looks the Scriptwriter/s didn't know what is MCU or what is Marvel. It so empty in the story. I don't recommend watching it."
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Really disappointed. Hoped it would somehow tie into the larger MCU, but it was in a Universe of its own. The story wasn't bad, but the choice of villain was."
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie!!! I don't know what everyone is talking abt. It was so camp, so fun, and features KO AND BEY AND BRITNEY? Are you kidding me??? A holy trifecta. Watch it, have fun!!"
"Feb 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I like the movie, but the film just sets up too much and shows little.

You can see how bad the movie, but just be aware they changed the script alot during production, so it's mostly all over the place.

Overall, cool movie, cool characters, and it's cool, but could be better."
"Feb 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,Definitely a descent movie.
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,Lots of people said not to watch it cuz it wasn’t good.  My daughters and I honestly thought it was good and enjoyed it. The storyline was good and interesting and I didn’t fall asleep considering it was late movie. Lol
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I understand now why this Marvel movie was released in February. The story is bad and probably killed any chance for a continuation of the character. Dakota does her best but her character is so poorly written that she couldn't do much with it. Other characters are shown as superheroes in visions of the future she has. They never develop those characters and you don't see them in their spider costumes except in her visions.
I think it's well overdue for Columbia/Sony to give control  over their marvel characters back to Marvel. Tahar Rahim is awful as the villain Ezekiel. I saw a question in an online forum whether his voice was dubbed because it sounds so bad. Unfortunately for him it wasn't and he speaks very good english in other roles I've seen him in. So what exactly was he attempting to do with his voice? And why didn't the director fix this. It was obvious it sounded horrible. That played a key part in me disliking this film."
"Feb 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The movie was better than the reviews I had seen. I thought the major weakness of the movie was either the script was weak in areas or the acting by the main address was forced at times. My grandson was also disappointed that the three young girls didn't really get to show there new powers in this movie and will have to wait for a sequel.  Also, don't wait for the end of the credits, there is no credits clip like all other Marvel movies. (Marvel associated)"
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,One of the worst movies I've seen in my life.
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,"yet another Spiderman film suffering from its lack of continuity with the MCU, It misuses a mentor character in the comics and turns it into a villain. The use of the other female Spider characters feels wasted and comes out as a sloppy mush.
Some of the camera work is a bit crazy. I'd love to get my money back with interest"
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Bad story, bad acting, horrible ending. It looks like a movie made in 2003."
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"A good movie. It really feels like something from the 2000s when the adaptations were simpler, but still fun. Better than 80% of the movies and TV shows the MCU has released in recent years, but the ""experts"" aren't ready to admit that."
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,"If I could give no stars I would, this was a terrible movie and its so bad its funny but the most laughable part is how the female stars think their characters can take on the spider-man. This movie shouldn't have been made if it couldn't be made correctly"
"Feb 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,Of course is not the best movie all times but its decent. It's a good movie. It has some things that are not very logical but in general the movie is entertaining. Don't believe what some critics say because must of them just want more fanfiction.
"Feb 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This is really a pretty decent B movie, if you approach it as an independent B movie, with some commendable (if predictable) themes, like the love of a mother. The biggest problem with the movie? It's a Marvel, Spiderverse, movie. It had high expectations to meet from the start, & it was never going to be able to meet them because of how high those expectations were from Marvel/Spiderverse fans. Furthermore, it did its best in action sequences, with only an 'invisible' superpower of being able to see the future.

Critics are humans too. They are also susceptible to biases. I'd take their views with a large pinch of salt."
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I went to see this movie specifically to witness its meme-in-the-making unintentional hilarity, and on that front, I was not disappointed. Writing that ranged from lazy to ludicrous and over-the-top production choices kept my theater audience howling with laughter. Ironically, this made it one of my favorite movie experiences of 2024 thus far...so I guess I'll add a half-star for that. The effects and fight choreography were exciting, too, which counts for something in a superhero film. In more capable filmmaking hands, the four female leads, all solid actors, could have made for a compelling on-screen team, which is a real bummer."
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"I can't recommend a movie more, this may have or may have not changed my life for the better 🤭
I laughed, I cried, I Madame Webbed…"
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"I Loved The Way The Movie Went . To Explain The Characters , No Little Easter Eggs Afterwards,I Would Like Them To Continue These Characters."
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great movie , start of a new exciting franchise !"
"Feb 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,It was a very inspiring movie the ending should’ve explained a little more on how the girls will be the next future of marvel characters. The beginning was a little confusing with the people that were dressed in red on who they were and should’ve explained the background of what they possess
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie wouldnt mind watching it again keeps you in edge
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The audio sync was absolutely terrible. There is not a single piece of dialogue that sounds like it comes out of an actor's mouth. The cuts in the film are wild and seemingly random. I'm not sure how such a massive flop passed all the checkpoints, unless there are no checkpoints?"
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie is an origin story and it was definitely a good movie. Not the best movie ever but i would not say it was bad.
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I mean, I definitely do not think it's the worst superhero movie, but it was just a headscratcher. The antagonist was severely underwhelming, the plot felt really predictable, the writing felt lazy, and there were a few parts that I didn't understand. Although I am a little curious where this story goes following the film."
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,We enjoyed the movie. The way her visions were filmed were better than most movies have portrayed visions of the future. D. Johnson was excellent.
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was actually pretty good it's the beginning of everything else for people who don't know is madame web like marvel the first movie don't let the other comments, fool you"
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was good. Really good - story, cast - all of it was enjoyable and I wasn't looking at the to see when it was going to end.  Glad I ignored all the negative reviews."
"Feb 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,I expected much more but had a decent time watching.
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"Took my 14-year-old daughter, and we loved it! Very well done and good storyline."
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,here is the proof I've been looking for ...  MARVEL needs to STOP making superhero movies......  13 on rotten tomatoes is 14 points higher then id rate this piece of marvel trash😃
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed the movie and I thought all the actresses did very well! I've seen it twice now and it unfolds like fanfiction.😌 I would really like to see a sequel that ties this movie to the venom-verse.
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie was great! Great back story it shows a different side of the spider verse. The movie shows her origin story why she was able to see the future of things to come. Loved the little hints about Ben having to be responsible for Peter Parker. Movie was awesome. Don't know why it's getting such bad reviews I believe people should just watch and enjoy instead of nitpicking
"Feb 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,Madame Web isn't bad but it's not good either. Very generic and forgettable. I think superhero films in general have run their course.
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Péssimo, desconexo ... roteiro, direção, cenas de açao... horriveis"
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I honestly don't understand how producers/studio execs saw this and said ""Yup, that's the one, release it in theaters""."
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,It may have made for a great tv series. The film has momentum. A few scenes where the three teen characters were out of character. But it all came to great story telling.
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,Very good very good story
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"I do not care how cheesy it was, sure the villain and the end scene sucked but it was extremely entertaining never the less, the script could definitely have been written better and I wish they had a completely different casting for the villain"
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,WHAT THE F- DID I JUST WATCH??? IM SO CONFUSED...I WASTED 1:48:43 SECONDS FOR THIS? I watched the whole thing and it made me more confused than to actually understand her so called story. (We dont talk abt the bqd cgi)
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,Movie was an entertaining origin story that isn't as bad as everyone is making out to be.
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,I liked the action and the plot
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,horrible what happened to marvel what a decadence !!
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,Lots of action. liked story as well.
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,I go to the movies to be entertained and I personally enjoyed the movie. The critics don’t know what they are talking about. I hope they make another one
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Ngl, I went in knowing it was going to be bad, but I didn’t think it would be this bad. The movie is filled with plot holes and confusing scenes in addition to poorly written characters. I had a hard time cheering on any of the characters because they were all pretty awful in their own right. Probably best to skip this one…"
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,Written by illiterate children.
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie was good. It was interesting and the action was great. The cast was brilliant. It’s worth seeing. 👍❤️😀
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Es una película innecesaria, la historia no atrapa, lo único rescatable son algunas actuaciones."
"Feb 24, 2024",NEUTRAL,It was a nice kid friendly movie.  Refreshing to not have sex scenes and profanity that young people will be seeing
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,The script for this movie is really bad. It’s filled with plot holes and cringey moments that do nothing for the story. I’ve seen better fan made YouTube movies than this trash. 
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Yet another Marvel fail. At this point, they just need to give up.

The ship has sailed. What made the Marvel movies fun and exciting is completely gone."
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed the film. The story line was gripping straight from the start. Really well made and all questions were answered.  Fingers crossed there is a sequel
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I think a lot of the reputation and reviews were quite harsh for this movie. I thought it was an okay movie overall. There were a good many parts I enjoyed and thought was well done in the movie. Most of this was regarding the first 2/3s of trying to come to terms with the powers. The train confusion was done well for example as it showed the state of disorientation the main character was in, with the audience just as disoriented. 
The lack of the villain characterisation and motivation made the movie weaker. The end also felt a bit rushed. 
Overall the mystery and understanding of the powers kept me pretty engaged for most of the movie, with the end needing to be fleshed out. 
Overall I would give it 5/10. Was decent enough for 1 watch."
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Marvel needs to take Spider-Man rights back from Sony. These Spider-Man related films BY SONY, (Not Marvel) are horrible. They cannot make a film without marvel guiding them. It keeps getting proven! Don’t waste your time on this movie, was a total dissappintment"
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,Not the worst recent Marvel movie. You can only hope that they shot some of the sequel at the same time. Doesn’t look like Sony is willing to spend more money on this.
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,It was a good origin story
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,I thought the film was pretty good madame web don't really have a origin story and Sony made it ppl say spider bite original not what I saw her mother was bitten by spider she was born after and illness is mentioned maybe this creeps up on her even tho in this states mother trying to save her daughter and she does go blind towards end think the villain needed work as didn't really follow the Spiderman knock off suit was but cleashay  other than thought was entertaining and the link to Parkers that not many I guess caught was pretty cleaver tbh
"Feb 24, 2024",NEUTRAL,"A light hero romp through DC t.v. style story-telling. Story-telling or character interaction being a kind of focus, instead of action."
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"When I saw the trailer and read about the stellar cast for Madame Web, I was incredibly excited. But after watching the movie I'm unsure how to feel. On one hand, the story lacked depth or complexity and there were not as many action sequences as I had hoped. The movie failed to deliver much excitement and was occasionally dull. However, on the flip side, I loved the themes of motherhood, love, and growth throughout and the cast was amazing!! I didn't hate or love the movie, it kind of just falls in the middle. It was sweet and a bit boring.  It didn't feel like this movie was a waste of time and it was better than some of Marvel's recent works. It's not anything close to Iron Man or any of the movies leading up to No Way Home but it beats the Eternals and the Marvels."
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,Fun movie really good
"Feb 24, 2024",NEUTRAL,I don't think it was completely bad ? Some of the actresses where not great at acting .. and the writing was not amazing but can honestly say it's not the worst movie I have watched in the past year or two.
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"""Madame Web"" disappoints on multiple fronts, stumbling through a convoluted plot that struggles to find its narrative footing. The characters lack depth, leaving audiences disconnected and indifferent to their fates. The cinematography feels uninspired, with scenes lacking the visual flair that could have elevated the movie. It's a missed opportunity for a compelling exploration of the Madame Web character, as the film falls flat in delivering a captivating and engaging experience."
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Sony, please give the rights to Spider-Man to the MCU. Not that the MCU is really doing great at the moment, but even Secret Invasion wasn't this bad! Clearly Sony is completely incompetent and destroying a beloved franchise!

Booooo! 
*Literally throws rotten tomatoes at Sony Executives*!!!!!!!!!"
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Filme ruim, não tem heróis.... Difícil de engolir! Não façam um dois 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽"
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"Stupendous 
I loved it
The best movie of   This year
I will watch it again
Fantastic
Emotional
 I love the characters 
I will give it 100% score on rotten tomatoes 
😀😅🥹😏😇🥲"
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,Good movie but no Easter Eggs at the end.
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,Loved this movie. Very action packed
"Feb 24, 2024",NEUTRAL,great but could be better
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Si tienen la oportunidad de ver ésta película en cine no lo hagan, es mejor esperar que salga en TV como canal 5 o algo así,  que cosa tan horrible"
"Feb 24, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It was a great movie and the cast was great, but it was a very heavy movie and it felt like a movie without a budget. It didn't have the action of a Marvel movie and it was also a bit confusing at times."
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"I went with my son expecting not to enjoy this one as much as other marvel movies,but I was wrong it turned out to be a very interesting movie with good characters that keep you at times on the edge of your seat, I recommend this one to all ages."
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I wanted to see if this movie is as bad as they say... Wow! WOW! It's so bad, even ""Morbius"" looks in comparison like ""the movie"". Generic, boring, bad story, plotholes, cringy acting, trash dialogs and no positives... Last act is almost parody... Aggressive product placement... Streaming quality, but only when you drunk enough! Stay away. This is very, very, VERY BAD film! Everyone associated with the production of this cr.p (writers, director, editors, sound team, CGI crew, even most actors) should be banned from working in their professions! We have the worst movie of 2024 and nothing will change that again... And no - it's no ""so bad it's good"" type!"
"Feb 24, 2024",NEUTRAL,I was expecting much worse based on the reviews. I have to admit I was mildly entertained.
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,Super entertaining and seriously underrated.
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"Madame Web delivers a captivating cinematic experience with stellar performances that elevate the storyline. The cast's great acting prowess brings depth to the characters, and the well-crafted storyline keeps you hooked. Surprisingly, amidst the suspense, the movie sprinkles moments of comedy that provide a refreshing balance, making Madame Web an entertaining and engaging watch. A must-see for those who appreciate a blend of great acting, a compelling storyline, and unexpected comedic gems."
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Well, it was definitely bad, but I still had fun."
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie could been better.
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,They had some decent scenes but overall the movie was just so bad and the dialogue did not match up with what they were mouthing half the time
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I am completely blown away this was even allowed to see the light of day, acting sucked & characters as whole sucked. Dialogue was so damn wonky it's sad. For a big budget film to come off as if they didn't have a care in the world on how this movie does. Godbless all those who worked on it but my god this is not good and never will be Sony needs to take this out back and put it down."
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie was pretty nice. Went in with low expectation but it was better than expected. To be honest, better than a lot of MCU action filled and CGI movies."
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Honestly, don't waste your time. They poorly edited it the majority of the time, and there is more plot holes then an entire years worth of swiss cheese. There's a insanely obvious last minute cut in the first five minutes of the movie. One minute the moms talking, next minute she's in pain mid word. Voice acting is beyond poor. The acting in general was poor. So many things happened in the story that just made absolutely no sense!! Missing parts of the story so the big emotional scenes are more funny then genuinely sad. At one point the main character just leaves her coworker with three teenagers casually and goes to the amazon forest up on a whim! And NOBODY BATTED AN EYE! You only get two scenes where you see the characters with powers and in costume (Besides the main character having her ''all seeing future'' ability) you just get glimpses and you hope the story gets there and IT NEVER DOES! They give you the tiniest snippet at the end and that was it. They give you hopes your gonna see some cool action and you never do. Another point, the only way the main character did any damage was by driving into people. The main character hit the bad dude a good 3 times with a vehicle and the bad guy just casually gets up. The enemy somehow withstood a point blank blow from an explosion and got up. The story had easily guessable plot points. ""Oh no! Danger! I can see what's going to happen! I must save them!"" easily was 70% of the movie. I'm pretty sure at one point a cat walked through a closed window. When filming, if the audio isn't movie-quality they will re-record the lines in the studio and edit them into the video so its less filming, and you can very easily tell they did it in this movie. There were some points where the lip syncing was not matching the audio I was hearing. I may have hearing problems but it was so bad. There were some points where you can tell they just copy & paste the audio onto the video file and put lipstick on a pig.
Its just a bad movie in general. And not the ""Fun Bad"" where you get a laugh, its just BAD!"
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie☝️💯 made me wanted to not live 🙏🙏🔥🔥🔥
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"I don't know why the people hate the movie. For me it was amazing I think what not many understood about the movie is that it is not the typical action plot of just fighting and winning. It is surviving the villain by not having experience, therefore it turns it into a suspense thriller and even a mystery that leaves you biting your nails, so yes, don't expect to see consecutive fights and multiple blows because remember that it is an ORIGIN movie. Well, everyone will have a different opinion of the movie, but give it a chance, you won't be disappointed."
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,i walked out first 10 min glad it was a free ticket
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,the build up was a little long
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great movie, quite entertaining and refreshing plot. Hope to see more of this universe."
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,Peak film. Watched it 3000 times. Absolutely loved it. First movie to sell one trillion tickets
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,Trailer over sold what the movie actual was
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie is entertaining. Your typical superhero movie. Not sure why all the hate!
"Feb 24, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I think people were expecting to see more action and, for her to be using her powers. To me this movie was more like her background and how she came to be. Personally I enjoyed it"
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!! worst superhero movie in years
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,this film is a bullshit.
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,My 6yr daughter and I loved it. Perfect movie for mother and daughter night.
"Feb 24, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Wasn’t incredible but wasn’t any where near what RT rated it. Excited for the second movie. Out of 10 I’d give it a 5, an average movie."
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,How you make a superhero movie w no superheroes😭
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It just wasnt great. Acting seemed bad. Very predictable and corny. If there was a bad decision to be made by the characters, they made it. I was annoyed most of the film. Theres obviously going to be more films with this story line. I am not even remotely interested. I have no issue with female led movies, but this seemed like that was the only reason for the film. Dear Marvel, this was terrible."
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I saw the movie in a Dolby Cinema screening and I was very disappointed. I entered the cinema with excitement's because I thought it was connected with Spiderman and I liked the trailer a lot (A lot of people hated it). The Open Scene was already bad. The Camera movement made me dizzy and the way they were zooming on the faces was terrible. After that I saw that the movie played in the year 2003 and I knew at that moment that this was not going to be like a Spiderman movie. The Villain was terrible. He wanted to kill three girls and that was his whole plan?! (What if he did would the movie end?) Also Dakota Johnson had no chemistry at all with the other girls. The movie had no plot twist that was feeling like one. The Ending was horrible because they didn't actually show the three girls as heroes. If you still plan to watch it don't spend extra money on any Premium Format (for example Imax, Dolby Cinema, 4DX or Screen X)"
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"""Madame Webb"" unfortunately falls short of expectations, delivering a lackluster experience that may be considered the weakest entry in Sony's Marvel lineup. The film's plot is uninspired and fails to captivate, lacking the depth and intrigue that are characteristic of successful superhero movies. The narrative meanders without a clear direction, making it difficult for viewers to remain engaged. Overall, ""Madame Webb"" is a disappointing addition to the Marvel universe, failing to deliver the excitement and entertainment that fans have come to expect."
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"""Madame Web"" falls disappointingly short of the mark in a genre that's become synonymous with spectacle and depth. This latest addition to the superhero cinematic universe feels both undercooked and overstuffed, failing to weave the compelling narrative its namesake suggests. Despite a promising premise that hints at the exploration of the mystic and the multiverse, the film meanders through a convoluted plot that struggles to find its footing. 

The screenplay is a patchwork of missed opportunities, with dialogues that often border on the banal, robbing the characters of the depth and complexity they deserve. The protagonist, meant to be a beacon of power and mystery, is rendered with a surprising lack of charisma and gravitas, leaving much to be desired in a performance that fails to captivate. 

Visually, the movie attempts to dazzle but instead delivers a series of CGI-laden sequences that feel more like a retread of better-executed spectacles in its genre. The action scenes, which should have been the film's saving grace, are instead predictable and lack the inventiveness or thrill that fans have come to expect. 

The direction is equally lackluster, with a pacing that oscillates between rushed and dragging, never quite finding the right rhythm to engage the audience fully. This uneven tempo, combined with a storyline rife with plot holes and unearned twists, makes for a viewing experience that is both confusing and unsatisfying.

In its ambition to expand the universe and delve into lesser-known characters, ""Madame Web"" ultimately spreads itself too thin, lacking the focus and narrative drive to make a lasting impact. What could have been a bold exploration of destiny and the web of fate feels instead like a missed connection, leaving fans longing for the depth and dynamism that this character truly deserves. In the end, ""Madame Web"" is a forgettable detour in an otherwise rich and vibrant landscape, a stark reminder that not all that glitters in the superhero genre is gold."
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"Honestly really enjoyed it, an easier movie to keep up than other Marvel films, not sure why it's so negatively reviewed, but I would 100% recommend it."
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was incredibly cringy
"Feb 23, 2024",NEUTRAL,It's good. It wasn't marvel level good but that's because it's not Disney marvel it's Sony. It was entertaining and had funny moments. It's worth seeing.
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was a good movie to watch when you have free time, doesn't deserve the bad reviews it has been given. Rounded story with great actors and actresses."
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"Not sure why this movie is receiving such bad reviews. I thought it was an excellent story, heartwarming, and creative. A quality watch."
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"I like it! I dont know why so many bad reviews..better than some marvel movies in my opinion, i hope they make a sequel🩷"
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"incredibly insubstantial, totally wasted"
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,Everybody was saying it was bad so I thought I'd check it out. It was definitely alot better than describe i really enjoyed it
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"insanely dated and awful vfx/editing, but if you're going to watch a really dumb movie and have a fun time, it gets the job done"
"Feb 23, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Theme  & overall  Idea was good.  You Cant tell it was a low budget film

Not worth full price . Good family movie"
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,Awful the acting was worse than anything I've seen in a long time YouTube has better acting! I had high hopes but I was shocked at how bad the acting was on EVERYONE'S BEHALF!!!
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,Sony should be embarrassed.
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,Worst movie ever! i dont recommend to watch this movie.
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"Suspenseful, thrilling, funny. Great movie."
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,God awful trash. Heads should roll over this vomit.
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"it is not a movie, is a galhofa!"
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,Movie was a huge pile of 💩.  I'm absolutely convinced the people leaving the positive reviews are ones who worked on the movie itself cause there ain't no way you sat through this garbage and actually found it entertaining. And if you did you're a total 🤡
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,What a horrible movie lol Don't waste your time watching it.
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,Didn't watch but looks stupid never seen trash next to a movie rating
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,Underwhelming and no super action
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Comparing to other Marvel movies…this was not good.  Mediocre acting, and really not good on effects.  Too many loopholes, disconnects.  Plot was ok, just not a good movie."
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,I wish I had the power of premonition so that I could saved my time from watching this.
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,The worst movie I've ever seen.
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"La trama me ha parecido interesante, la historia fue entretenida de principio a fin. La desventaja es que no parece una película convencional de superhéroes."
"Feb 23, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I definitely think this movie is being over hatted. Yes, there are some scenes that are predictable and the beginning is bad. Nonetheless, the movie can ne enjoyable for some."
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,Another boss chick showing how it's done.
"Feb 23, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I honestly can't understand much hate about this movie. It's truth: there are a lot of thing that could have done better. Some ideas where not really appropriate for the Spiderverse. But it's a origin movie of a character who doesn't have a great story development in comics.

The movie is far away to be the most fantastic ever, there are connections that could have been developed, but it tells a nice story, with a great acting of Dakota Johnson."
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Worse than a waste of time, poor editing, poor writing, ... just poor."
"Feb 23, 2024",NEUTRAL,Dakota Johnson carried this movie. It’s not a bad movie buts not great either. Did not care for the bad guys performance. It was like he was just reading the lines. No reacting involved.
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"this movie had no reason to exist, at least some people got paid to feed their families"
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,I thought this film was really good and I don't understand the hate it's getting. I thought they did see into the future mechanic really well
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I actually left the film to go let a staff member know the audio was out of sync with the video. Only to be told that was the quality of the film and was due to ADR they did for the Villian of the film. I had to look it up, ADR is automated dialogue replacement. It felt like this film was written by Ai as well as having audio replaced by it because it was a lifeless corpse of a movie with zero intrigue. I couldn't tell you any character's name except Cassie Web and the other main character, Pepsi-Cola."
"Feb 23, 2024",NEUTRAL,Corny and predictable- needed a better ending and timeline
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"No entiendo porque tanto hate a esta película realmente la disfrute, obviamente no es infinity war debido a que no tiene mucha acción, sin embargo es entendible su falta de acción pues es una película de origen y creo que cumple con su cometido; además recordemos que Madame Web no es un super héroe que suele tener sus luchas físicas si no que es más bien la que mueve las piezas y es la mente maestra que conecta todos los multiversos creo que la siguiente película donde aparezca madame web será en Spider-Man y le hará justicia a este personaje (MW) y a esta película de origen pues cuando salga Madame Web en Spider-Man ya no tendremos que ver el orígen si no más bien veremos como ayuda a Peter Parker y como se conectan todos los spyder-verse recomiendo que lean los comics a partir del #210 de Amazing Spider Man publicado en 1980 para que comprendan el porque es así está película; en sí Madame Web es muy compleja para que quede plasmada en una sola película de hecho en los comics y en la serie animada es un poco confuso como se va presentando Madame Web a Peter Parker"
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"Simply an amazing movie, best superhero film since End game and no way home. i was glued to the screen all the way through thinking wow this looks awesome and why has every said its rubbish, i dont know, i thoroughly loved it and will never listen to anyone ever again. You know when you are blind to the petty stuff people get hung up on it turns out its just a really good movie."
"Feb 23, 2024",NEUTRAL,Liked the action .... hated the fact that the main characters were in their costumes so little of the time.... when the pic's on the  web were the same amount as in the film was just too few.
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"That was wasn't good the dialogue,the plot the whole thing a train wreck 😳"
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,I couldn’t watch it in the theaters.  Scary demon audience and Dakota Johnson makes absolutely no sense as Cassandra Webb other than a seriously sick terror film.  I couldn’t stand any of the baby/pregnancy scenes & found the first 15 minutes I watched appalling.  The car crashing into the water and near death experience that unlocked her so called abilities is a completely out of line sequence in my book.
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,La peor película que e visto de Marvel hasta ahora.
"Feb 23, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Lazy writing unfortunately but entertaining for young audiences, how did she become professor X?"
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,Good movie was good not that bad I love Dakota Johnson she good actress the action was great in it 
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was a great movie, better then expected."
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I tried, but definitely this was a train wreck. Boring, badly cut and written, hope this is rock bottom so things can improve from here."
"Feb 23, 2024",NEUTRAL,Watch it if you have absolutely nothing to do
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,Need Madame Web 2 so we can get more of those glasses
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,Zero stars was not an option
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"Madam Web was a GREAT MOVIE 🍿 !!!I could relate a lot because I survived foster care & I also enjoyed watching the #PowerPuffGirls & 90s #SpiderManCartoons . Honestly it reminded me of @marwilliamson if she was in the #FinalDestinationMovies 🍿🥰💭. Watching Madam Web last Tuesday night at Highland Square w/ my Current favorite Ex Polyamorous Sisterwife & this married couple I met at the bar recently was a fun experience. My ex Sisterwife & I were LAUGHING, crying, experiencing the roller coaster 🎢 thrills of the movie 🍿. The married couple not so much."
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"Don’t believe the bad reviews!  This was a great movie, it’s up there with the rest of the Marvel movies.   Don’t pass up on it, you will not be disappointed.  My daughter and I almost didn’t go because we had read the bad reviews too.  We are fans of Dakota and decided to go regardless and glad we did, we would of missed out!   Not in one moment did I feel like I needed to get up and leave.  Not sure why this movie is not getting the support it deserves."
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,Two Words:Sydney Sweeney
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,Well it wasn't perfect I enjoyed the action the story and suspense.
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely death sentence for the film industry 
I can't believe people have wasted money on something like this. 🤢🤮"
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"I believe the movie was really good and I don’t get what the fuss is about, yes it’s not an adaptation or retelling of a comic book, but the story is very good, and overall enjoyable a bit cheesy a times and our only complaint being the rushed Amazon sections as well as the kids powers but aside from that 5/5"
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,Filme extremamente intediante
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,I went in hoping it wasn't as bad as everyone was saying…and everyone was right. The script felt like it was written by a middle schooler and the acting was just cringe.
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the movie and i hope to see more of the characters in the future marvel movies
"Feb 23, 2024",NEUTRAL,For the most part the main villain was rather forgettable and unassuming. Certain points felt rushed along and the dialogue seemed abnormally simple and repetitive.
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Sony, I'm sorry for what I said about Morbius."
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,I love everything about this movie. It was completely and 100% amazing. And the cast is amazing as well. I can't wait to buy it! 😍
"Feb 23, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I'm not a comic book reader but know they changed Madame web

The film isn't dreadful nor stunning, I liked parts of it but just as many parts were cheesy and cringe worthy

I like Dakota tho"
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,it was not great didn't love it at all much
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This is the first review I have written to come on and tell you all it was bad. The end was very cheesy, the lips didn't seem to line up with the sound sometimes like they re-recorded it, some plot point seemed very rushed. Also felt like the villain didn't really have any depth. It was great concept that just seemed to not be done right. Still better than human centipede"
"Feb 23, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed it. Tbh plenty of flaws, like I think they tried to make the end too typically action and it failed but on the whole it was a refreshing approach to the superhero genre. The ‘trip to Peru' would have made more sense as a vision but it's just a few plot problems. They all have them. Just enjoy the good stuff (there was plenty)"
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,Sickingly bad story.
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie trailers don't do it justice!!!
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,Surprisingly good! Got emotionally involved and liked the ensemble.
"Feb 22, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I really enjoyed this movie, I went in blind, I had not seen trailers or anything beforehand. I enjoyed the story line as well and it was a very action packed movie. 

My only criticism is that it is somewhat forgettable towards the ending.

Also I can understand how if someone was expecting a marvel type Spiderman movie, they would be disappointed. I was happy it wasn't that."
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,Pretty good movie. Would have liked more action but other than that it's pretty good
"Feb 22, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It was better than expected based on all the poor reviews. It's not stellar, not making any top ten lists for anyone's favorite movies, not the ""old Marvel"" quality but better than a lot of the DC movies. It's Sony -- yes the plot is rushed in parts, of course there will be plot holes, but it was entertaining ... for the most part. Definitely one you can wait to stream."
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,Oh my oh my...dear oh dear...I lasted only 45 minutes of this sheer torture...simply awful awful awful...dear Sony please stop now..over and out
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,Zero stars isn't an option
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not the worst movie ever made, but that doesn't make it great either. Meh"
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,Wasted potential. Sad
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"Overall really liked it - the how do you know you can climb a wall unless you try scene had me in absolute stitches.

Is it cheesy? Yes but that's also kind of great sometimes. 

I loved how they visualized the future telling - and tying it into the web of destiny.

Only a few misses for me:
- Should have made the last scene the post credit scene 
- what were those glasses at the end?"
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"i thought this was flawed but way better than reviews say. 
the first 40 min were great - it just started to fall apart after MW returns to the jungle. 
And yes, the villain sucked and the teenage girls were totally underutilized. But Dakota's banter was fun. I've seen much worse."
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,One of the worst films I have ever seen in my life so far. Words cannot even describe how torturous it was for me to have to sit through this in the movie theatre. I may have to sign up for trauma based therapy to cope.
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,does not deserve to be called film
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Unfortunately one only finds out very close to the end that this is nothing but a prequel to another movie with more girlie Marvel heroines. This said this movie here doesn't say much on its own. The fact that the extra dollars for the D-Box (seat movements) I had spent being a complete waste of money, pretty much shows that there is way too much teen girlie talk, and too little action. The movie isn't ""really"" bad, but it is surely nothing worth to waste your time for to watch it in a cinema unless you are a girl of 14 years of age. 3/10 points. P.S. Except for the villain the acting of everybody else among this cast was pretty lousy. I feel that Marvel has reached the end of the rope."
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Just.... trash, a waste of money and time, a joke."
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I wouldn't say it was worse than any of the other Sony Marvel films but not better either. I liked the premise but didn't think they explored it too well. With none of the heroes having any offensive powers or fighting skills, a lot of the confrontation was just running and crashing cars. I enjoyed the glimpses of the girls costumes we saw, very comic accurate. There wasn't any explanation as to what the Web actually was or how Cassie's powers work, not even a single reference to her as Madame Web. I liked the found family concept between Cassie and the girls but felt there wasn't enough time exploring it. Also too many teasers about the fact that Ben is Ben Parker and his nephew Peter being born without anybody actually saying last name or the Baby's name. When you make it that obvious it's just annoying when you can't just say it out loud ."
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,Worst of the worse! Do not watch! Waste of money and time.
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"Seems like the so called critics have become bored as they continue to berate comic book movies, these movies are not meant for them. This movie is a good movie as it sets up the story, it is not bad as the critics say it is. They seem to lean toward R rated movies, and most people just wait to stream because its in their budget."
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,worst hero movie of all time
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,Without question this is the worst superhero of 2024.
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Filme ruim ,roteiro sem sentido pior 3 ato de filme , nunca se quer usar os trajes em batalha, personagens sem valor que o filme tenta fazer nos se apega com os personagens porém erram muito nisso , e o vilão pula na ambulância pra se atropelado kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk , simplesmente filme bosta demais"
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,I am not going to waste my time on this garbage.
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not great, but better than expected !"
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"don't compare to other Marvel movies,  as it is a great stand alone movie with a lot of suspense and keeps your interest"
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Had to walk out, and could not finish watching."
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,loved!! don't let the opinion of chronically online brain rots tell you this movie is bad. it amazing and i will be seeing it again!!
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,it really is absolutely god awful. it's shite
"Feb 22, 2024",NEUTRAL,This film was not as bad as people are saying. I liked it. There were hot girls and they did their thing. Haters gonna Hate. I got your back Dakota.
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I mean, I don't even have the words to describe how absolutely terrible of a superhero movie this was."
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,This origin story was expertly executed. Even someone with no previous knowledge of this character will be captivated. The story line moves at a perfect pace and the actors did an excellent job personifying their characters. This is one of the first Marvel movies in a long time that left me excited to see what comes next. I was only surprised at how few people where actually at the theater... The critics reviews definitely did not match up with what I experienced and I'm glad I went to see it anyway because me and the other 7 people that went with me to the theater all left wondering how this movie can be that good and not be getting more attention.  @Hollywood... The critics are (unfairly) killing your industry. It's time for a change and this movie is a perfect example of that.... Here's to hoping we get some sequals to this awesome movie!!
"Feb 22, 2024",NEUTRAL,It wasn't terrible it did have some pacing issues. I don't have an issue with female leads which I think a lot of the bad reviewers have.
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,I know it could of been way better but I liked it. The ending could of had a little more. The cgi on the spider was on point.
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"No geral, não é um filme excelente, mas me deixou bem. É um filme com um roteiro modesto e simples, gostei bastante das personagens e adoraria vê-las em novos filmes com um desenvolvimento maior das personagens..."
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,I thought the villain's voice was dubbed it sounded so bad.  Wow I like most movies but this was unwatchable.  Love Adam Scott in everything and just saw Dakota on SNL which was great but what possessed them after reading this script to do this movie? Ugh!
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie makes Kraven the Hunter feel like Good Will Hunting compared to this. Where was Morbius😭
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It's a shame, not a movie."
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Listen my precious little ravioli, this film couldn’t have been worse, I know damn well there wasn’t no damn script, they put them girls into costumes and said “just go with it! Say whatever you want!” Awful, horrible, eh-stupah, the very opposite of iconic. This movie is like the potato salad at the cookout, ain’t nobody want that bland sh*t. This movie actually stressed me out so now I gotta go take a nice hot bubba bash. Ugh god love ya ( seriously don’t watch it, this movie was a joke )"
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"marvel isn’t even trying anymore, they just put out anything to stay relevant but by doing that no one wants to watch their movies anymore. it used to be so much fun to go see the new marvel movies in theaters and now it’s just a disappointment with AI dialogue."
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,Worst movie I’ve ever seen please do not see it
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie gets half a star for having Sydney Sweeney. It fails in every other category, including utilizing her. "
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Sony hits a new low with ""Madame Web"" which is truly one of the worst comic book movies of recent memory. This movie has terrible dialogue, acting, and story, and not much redeemable about it. I do feel like it is often unintentionally funny and I had some fun because of how awful it was, so maybe it could work for a bad movie night. I know many were super hard on ""Morbius"" but this movie makes that movie look a lot better because if you think it couldn't get worse, it absolutely could. Aside from all of this, the movie is just boring. The action scenes are minimal and the story just didn't grab me with its characters or plot intrigue. Overall, it is a movie that is so bad that it actually may even be worth seeing, but a definite reminder that comic movies need an extended break."
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"TRASHED MOVIE LIKE MARVEL  came out 
 last year."
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,Muss echt nicht sein
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I firmly believe it had potential but took a pitiful turn. The cast is good, but the script lacks the soul of superhero movies. It leaves a bitter taste in the mouth and I think it aspired to more than it could deliver. It took hasty steps with the intention of establishing a new streak of hero movies and that almost seems like a project of film students (who have not even started the career), the script is bad and has many gaps, there was a base idea that could have been very good but took the wrong path. The special effects are weak and low budget. The villain is stupid and seems like a bad joke. The main characters feel empty and plastic. I feel sorry for it because I had faith in the superhero genre and thought it could bring something fresh to the Spider-Man universe, but it didn't and it's very sad because it has good actors and could have been a fresh movie and, while not groundbreaking, it could have been more than it is."
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,I liked Madame Web.  It was fun to watch and it actually had some nice themes.  Ignore the critics and view this movie with an open mind.
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"Incrível, maravilhoso, a tempos não assistia um filme de heróis tão bom, roteiro redondo, efeitos, amei demais."
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"My family and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I went in with zero expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Other than a few mismatched diaglouge scenes with the villain, I thought the storyline was good, and I liked the characters."
"Feb 22, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Wasn't nearly as bad as the critics and fanboys are making it sound. It was a bit slow with minimal fighting and an abundance of dialogue. The acting wasn't terrible, but I also wouldn't tout it as anything great. I think it's worth a free viewing once it hits TV."
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"I didn't think it was that bad. I liked it and had fun. It was sort of similar to Venom in that no one can mention Spiderman, but it is clearly related. Great cast and fun action. Just don't take yourself or the movie too seriously. :-p"
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,Filme sem qualidade alguma. Da pena dos atores que fizeram isso aí.
"Feb 22, 2024",NEUTRAL,It was better than morbius lol
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie is solid.  No overplayed campiness or humor.  Web character develops nicely... in layers.  No drawn out sequences.  It is an origin story that gives you the purpose of the main character.  It isn't an over the top hero movie with huge action scenes.  Well done!
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,I thought it was well done. Went with an open-minded attitude and was surprised. It was fun and entertaining.
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"1/5, not the worst movie I’ve ever seen or the most boring either. It only kept my attention for the first and only viewing due to how jarring some of it is. Yet that doesn’t make it a good movie or some style I’d like to see. I watch most films only once. So I wouldn’t watch this again or some other films. However, I find this film as watchable as The Marvels. But that’s a low low bar."
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"I thought it was great, it had a lots of action and a really complex plot. It's everything i'd want to see in a movie. it was very complex with lots of mind twists. I liked it because it was something new, with a totally new idea and spin on the spiderverse plots. I love the other spider verse movies, but this definitely has a fresh perspective I though was very refreshing. It absolutely does not deserve the hate, the acting was good and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time!! I hope more people go to see it and they can make up their own minds on the movie. Great story, great  plot, great acting. I hope more people give it a watch."
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"I don't know how much I was laughing with the film vs laughing at the film, but all I know is I had a great time. On the surface, this film is a trainwreck filled with silly special effects, cringe-inducing dialogue, poorly developed characters who make inane decisions, and one character whose lines are so badly dubbed over, it will distract you from the first scene. But when you look closer, it seems very likely that at least some of the people involved were trying to make this film as a comedy, leaning into the absurdity of the story and the dumb plot. Dakota Johnson seems to be going for intentional laughs, not only in scenes where her character is cracking jokes, but also in ones where she has one-sided conversations with a bird or a cat, awkwardly advancing the plot in laughable fashion. Yes, this movie is very dumb in so many ways, but it seems like at least Johnson and director SJ Clarkson (who has directed some of the best TV of the last 20 years, including season 4 of Dexter and season 1 of Succession) know how dumb the film is and really lean into it to provide an uproariously fun time. It's no mistake that Cassandra tells her three wards ""Don't do dumb things"" before leaving them alone in the woods for three hours, knowing full well these teens are bound to do something absolutely idiotic. Nor is it an accident that the product placement is woven so prominently into the fabric of the story that it almost serves as a deus ex machina. The studio clearly wasn't in on the joke or they wouldn't have excised the film's most notorious trailer line from the final film - you know, the one about Ezekiel Sims having been with her mother in the Amazon where she was studying spiders right before she died. But try as they might, the innate camp of the film shines through, making this an instant cult classic in the vein of Howard the Duck and Steel before it. If you're into that sort of thing, head to the theater with a likeminded group of friends and you'll have a blast. 5 Freaking Stars"
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie makes me believe in magic. Magic is the only thing would allow Dakota Johnson and Sydney Sweeney to be ‘A-listers' in movies. Sorry for the hate, I'm sure they are lovely people, but they are awful to watch, just like this movie. Hey, I've got a great idea… let's light a firework factory on fire and then climb up to the roof. What's the worst thing that could happen? Oh yeah, and the fireworks are as powerful as missiles and can blow up a helicopter. And another thing… this brilliant idea ends up killing the helicopter pilot, who we called in to save us, but whatever. 

I never really use the term ""complete garbage"", but this is where the shoe fits."
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The dialogue was unrealistic, the supercool suit designs were probably on screen for one minute, the villain is not complex and even so his whole motive is a cliche with no actual movie like substance, and the climatic ending wasn’t that enjoyable. Overall, it’s just entertaining enough to get a group through two hours of watching characters that are hard to connect to if you make jokes every 15 minutes with your party."
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,Could have come to part where they learned and used powers earlier
"Feb 22, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Me pareció entretenida, pochoclera y con mística comiquera. El cine de superhéroes no está pasando por su Golden Age y hace que una película que en otro momento era buena hoy sea calificada como un bodrio."
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"""Madame Web"": una decepcionante caída en la trampa de la inclusividad superficial. Esta película, en su afán por seguir la moda de destacar mujeres como protagonistas en el género de superhéroes, no solo fracasa en su intento, sino que también arrastra consigo las últimas esperanzas del cine de superhéroes. Los efectos visuales son de baja calidad, el guión es predecible y trillado, y la trama resulta aburrida y carente de emoción. En lugar de innovar, la película se conforma con clichés y estereotipos, dejando a los espectadores con una sensación de vacío y decepción. En resumen, ""Madame Web"" es un desastre cinematográfico que hace más daño que bien a la industria del cine de superhéroes."
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,All I have to say is yikes.  Were they even trying?  The lack of effort put into this movie was apparent throughout the entire movie.
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"It is so good, the first act is a bit fast but the movie is so good, the only ""bad"" thing are visions VFX, they are a bit bad but not much, 4 stars"
"Feb 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Ughhhhhhhhhhhh

Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Who let this movie get released?

Saying that the cast was phoning it in is an insult to phones. Everyone in this film clearly did not want to be there in the slightest. Though Dakota Johnson is getting rightfully called out for it, there is a glimmer of personality in the few scenes where they lean into the dry humor. The worst offender is Tahar Rahim, who plays the villain Ezekiel Sims (AKA Evil Spider-Man for some reason??). Half of the time it sounds like he recorded his lines in a vocal booth and they were dubbed over the performance later. The dialogue doesn't line up with his mouth and it all feels incredibly forced and awkward.

The plot of the movie doesn't even really make sense, and the way the story is told makes even less sense. What's the point of the flashback at the beginning of the film if we're gonna have to watch the main character painstakingly learn everything that we, the audience, already know? And why make so many Spider-Man references without it even going anywhere?? It's just a reminder that there are three franchises worth of better movies we could be watching.

Okay, a few rapid-fire complaints. The teenage girls are very obviously twenty-somethings acting like awkward idiots the whole time. It was stupid as fuck to cast Adam Scott, who is known for playing Ben Wyatt on Parks and Rec, as another character named fucking BEN. Why the fuck do the jungle spider people speak English??????

Unless you really want to laugh at an absolutely terrible film, do NOT see this movie."
"Feb 22, 2024",NEUTRAL,it's fine people relax lol
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie makes The Human Centipede look like a masterpiece I truly cannot believe sony could mess up a spider man related movie this bad but I guess I was wrong…
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,"First off, not sure why so much hate for this movie. Considering the recent marvel flops, this one stood its ground. That’s not to say there weren’t issues because there were several that stuck out to me: 1. Not sure what role/purpose the 3 young girls played? It was pretty much just filler to me? 2. Not sure why Emma Roberts was even in this movie? Maybe  I’m missing a Marvel clue?? 3. Why did Dakota Johnson appear to be smiling at the most inappropriate times throughout the film? 4. Considering Dakota’s character personality at the beginning of the movie, the ending just did not vibe with that.  Other than those questions I had afterwards, it was an entertaining film and glad I saw it in the theater."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,I'm all for girl power in action movies. I thought it was well done. I never read the comic so I didn't have anything to compare it to. I'm not sure why it's getting harsh critiques. I thought it was well done and I'd watch the sequel if there is one.
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie was so good and had a spectacular storyline. Not only that, this film have the best fitting cast ever, Emma Roberts, Dakota Johnson?? I won't understand the hate for this movie or tolerate it. If you're scared to watch it because of the reviews and you don't want to waste your money like I worried, I promise you, if you walk in with a good mindset and ignore what the critics say, you will love this movie as much as the rest of us. It was perfectly lengthed, suspenseful and had great writing, not every movie has to be Endgame level or NWH or any pivotal movie because that's what make them special, but this movie was the perfect combination of not undermining Endgame and enough to love just the same, 100% recommended!"
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,"To be honest, it isn't as bad as most people thought to be, and I'm one of those people that are easy-going when rating movies. I've seen far worse corny superhero action movies and Madame Web is not one of them in my opinion. I find the story to be straight forward mostly except at certain times, character chemistry can need some more work. At least the movie got the job done, though in a kind of underwhelming way. Overall, 7/10, not bad but could've been way better in execution."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,I just watched this and all I can figure is that the critics are just looking for ways to bash marvel? This movie was good. Was it guardians of the galaxy? No. But it was as good as any spawn movie so far. It is worth the price of admission. I think people are bashing on it cuz it's female led? I'm a 52 year old dude and it was a good time out for me.
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"Very enjoyable. Good telling of the origin story, good villain, good action, tight script with no superfluous silliness (and no over the top insanity as Marvel films have suffered from lately), heck yes to female leads and superheroes, and to the critics, I say, it's a comic book, not Shakespeare. My wife and I came to the movie with no knowledge of the story or expectations and thought it was terrific from start to finish. If you like Marvel or superhero movies I think you'll enjoy this."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"Nice setup movie into future events, it left the door wide open..."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I thought this movie was fairly decent, 6.5/10, though it feels a shame the 3 girls didn't get much screen time as their ‘super hero counter parts' it definitely set up a future movie and showed that there doesn't always need to be a strong hero to overcome threat and defeat a villain. There was also some fairly creative parts to this movie were the 3 girls used a life and death lesson from a paramedic point of view. Lastly I would like to comment on how good the villain suit looked and his ‘movement' I thought was also brilliant in certain parts of the movie without spoiling it 😁"
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie was great! 100/10 I can say this movie was better than the Avengers infinity war
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,Nothing is good in this movie.
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"i mean this was legitimately one of the worst big budget releases ever made

any ""critic"" that gave this anything above a 3/10 should be fired for either incompetence or for being paid off, the people who gave it a positive review would be better off lobotomized"
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"I wasn’t expecting it to be THIS good. I wouldn’t trust other reviews saying it’s bad, see the movie for yourself"
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Ended up leaving the movie early. Hard to watch, poor acting, bad story transitions. Too much to put. Very disappointing."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web - 3.8 - A cinematic experience that left me questioning Marvel's stamp of approval. Sony's was the lead in production and they didn't fare much better as it suffered from an unfortunate casting choice with Sydney Sweeney, known for her bombshell image, attempting to portray a sweet innocent teenager. The result? A film that struggled to be taken seriously, evoking unintentional laughter from the audience during crucial scenes. Dakota Johnson's attempt at dry, sarcastic humor earned some points, but when it came to emotional depth, the laughter continued. The lead villain's Peruvian accent added an unfortunate layer, sounding more awkward than menacing. The plot, unfortunately, didn't offer much excitement and felt overly simplistic. As the story unfolded, the theater was met with a corny ending that had the entire audience cracking up - not the reaction one hopes for in a Marvel-associated film. Despite the inclination to give it the benefit of the doubt, the 13 percent rating I had seen elsewhere seemed more reflective of the reality. In the end, 'Madame Web' was a cinematic disappointment, and one I regret giving a chance, official sundaynightstreaming rating of 3.8"
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"I really liked this movie and found it refreshing that it was not totally marvel-esque, although I do love a good Marvel movie. While a few of the lines early in the movie felt a bit forced, I thought all of the actresses and actors did a nice job and I enjoyed it thoroughly!"
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"So stupid. It’s like a 6th grader wrote the script. I love Marvel movies but this movie had a dumb plot. It was very shallow. There wasn’t a lot of depth to the characters. So awful, they need to remove the movie and start with a NEW writer and a more experienced director .  So bummed that this wasn’t  even an okay movie."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,Der schlechteste Film 2024 den ich je gesehen habe  schlechte Regiearbeit Schnitt die visuelen  Effekte diese Elemente zur Atmosphäre gesamtwirkung des Film beitragen Dialoge drehbuch  die Ästhetik noch schlimmer als Morbius
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Small spoiler-

Good concept, bad execution. Acting was less than standard sitcom, dialogue was worse and people were announcing inner thoughts (if it was an attempt at a quip please look up good examples or don't use AI to generate these lines). It feels like nobody did a proof-read or even looked at the takes. Bad guy tried to put on a bad guy voice, there's other ways to seem like a killer. If spiderman was around during this time why not make a reference saying ""I thought spiderman was a good guy, why did go psycho?"" Could have been a trademark issue, still ""mentioning"" pop culture or any material isn't a crime. 

I'm going to reiterate that you don't need to announce a thought or idea the character is having if you're going to show behavior implying this. It's useless, and makes the characters seem dumber than they actually are.

Scenes that could be better: Intro into amazon (whole thing); any suitcase scene, she doesn't need to say anything just bring in the notes closer. If you're trying to make an uncle Ben moment maybe there should have been more focus on that character rather than a three line conversation and a background shot...

You know what, go watch a pixar film. Nobody should give the time of day on this if the director wasn't going to."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,What was that? Yikes
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,The storyline leads with a cliffhanger. But was well made and I enjoyed the action and cinematography..
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,It's should be a crime to watch this film. Nothing more nothing less.
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"Signed up to Rotten Tomatoes just so I could rate this movie. I think it's getting a bad rap. There were elements of the acting that weren't great, the dubbing was poorly executed and I think some scenes were poorly directed. However I really liked the overall story line and the suspenseful nature of the story kept me interested through the whole movie. I wouldn't mind another movie with these characters, perhaps with a bit better dialogue."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,It was a very good movie I’m happy I went and seen it money well spent
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,A couple of the dumbest scenes and most unrealistic scenes I have ever seen. YES.... Even for a comic book movie!!!
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,"A lot of hate about the movie and not only, but I say it's pretty ok, it has potential, Dakota Johnson has potential and her character could be better highlighted, if a good script was thought and not written on the knees.I say go to the cinema to see it."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Another terrible Marvel movie with bad CGI, lazy writing and bland characters. When will they understand that we are tired of this garbage? There is an over-saturation of superhero movies. We want normal movies!"
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,I’d give this film Zero stars if I could. It was an absolute train wreck. God awful acting and the script was absolute garbage. Dakota Johnson CAN’T ACT. PERIOD
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"Much better than I expected as it was quite interesting and somewhat suspenseful.  
Glad I saw it as was thinking of skipping it due to some poor reviews."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The villain's motivations are a little forced, but overall an enjoyable film. Not the worst of Sony's offerings."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Painful to watch aggressively stupid and unbelievably nonsensical movie, which is highly offensive to intelligent audiences.
This movie would have worked better as a weird parody of superhero movies.
Believe me, It's  a cross between ""Glenn or Glenda"" and Catwoman"" , but without the ""so bad it's good"" charm. An Ed Wood's movie with a big budget written while he was at his deathbed."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,I did enjoy this film with great actors and actresses but it's one of those films that not a lot of people would love and also wouldn't be in a rush to watch it again Sydney Sweeney was a standout for me
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie was boring and could not hold the attention of a rock.  The only interesting, and that's going out on a limb, was the very end where the three girls got their mojo.  I hope they make a movie  with the three girls and let Madame Web remain in her web and not come out again."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,"While this movie wasn’t great, I thought it passed the time alright. Maybe my expectations were a lot lower than other folks who went to see it. It was a bit slow in parts and the acting and visual effects could have used a bit of polishing. Again, while not the best movie, it was far from the worst I’ve seen in the last year or two."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I give the movie a C+.. Compared to the great Marvel movies this is one of the few that was at the bottom of the list. I  mean the best thing they could do is make a sequel to this particular one to get it right. Maybe this particular script was Done the way it was on purpose for a better box office leap on the next one. Hmm, well at least I  hope. Idk, but I could have waited for that to stream on Disney+.."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Several of my fav actresses are in movie, but sadly, it just did not work. Baffled how the movie was even launched at theaters. Still love Dakota. Will give you a pass."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"no logic,story ,it had noting to watch"
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,One of the most underwhelming superhero movie I've ever seen. I went to see it with an open mind but it was boring and the worst superhero origin story you can imagine. Even the action scenes were bad. A true disaster. I don't understand how can a studio can release that…
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It made me laugh not gonna lie,if you go and watch the movie Ironically i think you'll have a good time."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Save your money.  The plot was paper thin, the writing was bad & the acting was terrible.  The CGI was not great either.  Everything depicted about the paramedic profession was more laughable & unrealistic than normal.  The only positive is that maybe the audience has been educated in how to give chest compressions."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Sooo bad, everything about this movie was bad, bad actors, bad storyline, beyond disappointed."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I actually enjoyed this more than The Marvels. The story, to me, was intriguing. Throwing in a Ben Parker storyline was cute, particularly since we got to see the birth of Peter Parker. Overall, it started off a bit weak. But once Cassie's visions start, they draw you in because you want to know/figure out how they work. The CGI and action scenes could've been better, either they seemed slow motion or the actors were afraid to do the stunts. The same scene where Las Aranas crawled down the tree was shown more than once, they could've done that differently for their second on screen appearance."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I went into this not really knowing what to expect. Spider Man has been my favorite character since childhood so I pretty much know all of the players in the universe. If you're looking for a superhero smash and fight movie, this isn't it. It's more character driven with very little in the way of costumes. Does that make it bad, like many of the reviews claim? No, just different. To me it's a bit refreshing to get something that tells a story without the action usually associated with superhero movies."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,Amazing movie. Dont worry about plot or pacing or dialogue !!
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Lazy script, shallow characters, too much convenience, terrible direction, complete disconnect from Madame Web's story."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,Absolutely Terrible.
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,Absolute rubbish....Pls no sequel
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The film was boring and soul-less, it was a drag."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,Absolutely LOVED the movie! Wish there was a sequel in the making
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,The script certainly needed tightening to inject some pace in an otherwise meandering movie which lacks humour and suspense or any engaging characters. Not an awful movie but not one to waste the price of a ticket on so better to wait for it to appear on a streaming platform.
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,Total mess from beginning to end.
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"Being a person who grew up a full on comic book lover. Of course I took my 15 yr old daughter to see it! We loved it! It’s a great origin story and I love the new take on how she became Madam Web! Dakota Johnson is amazing as usual! And spoiler alert, I love the little how ins about Peter Parker and uncle Ben! I hope we’ll see a second one in the not so distant future"
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Just good. Its honestly better than what I was expecting for a B character's origin story. The story didn't really try anything ground breaking, but I thought the visuals were good also. Dialogue felt a little jumpy, like reading an actual comic book if that was the intent, then good on the writers. 6/10"
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It was actually a decent movie. I felt a little mislead by trailers because I was expecting something different from what it turned out to be, but the end result was still alright."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,i didn't even watch it i'm js a hater🙆‍♀️
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"You could tell the writing was lacking and the story was in need of fine tuning. While I'm sure some of the actors were just working with what they were given, others you could tell weren't really feeling it. You can find some appeal if you can connect with the main characters and overlook the cringy moments. Special Effects were decent enough. The concept could've been the making of a new franchise, but ultimately, I feel with this delivery, this isn't going anywhere anytime soon."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,The movie dragged.  Wasn’t excited about the movie
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Not bad. Her powers are not the typical flying,punching,leaping, great physical strength or moving at the speed of light. It will be interesting to see where they go with the characters that were introduced. If they do another movie on this, I would see it. Hoping more will be revealed on how Madame's power will be fully expressed as well as the other three characters. Will she travel back to Peru to gain more understanding to the layers of her gifts?"
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Worst movie I have ever seen. Choppy with painful dialog. Save your money, the reviews are correct."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,So good I want to watch more!
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed this! The ending was a little weak but I had a genuinely good time
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie definitely would watch it again
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"I thought there would be more web-ey stuff, but otherwise, I really enjoyed the plot."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Unbelievably bad. A waste of time and money for all involved. A career crusher. A spider-man, superhero movie made by people who don't watch superhero movies or read comic books. Dull. Borrows footage from Spiderman 2. Morbious made us groan threw-out, and somehow this is worse. Fifty Shades of Booger-Green. Bad FX. Bad dialogue. Bad pacing. Bad directing. Unmemorable characters. Sony should stop trying."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,The CGI was bad and the dialogue was terrible. The ending was not real at all.
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,Lame. No other word. Seems Marvel is trying hard to turn into DC comics.
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Good plot and action
Terrible acting and dialog"
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Definitely not as terrible as I was led to believe it would be, but certainly not a strong film. Not much character development for many characters, but an interesting premise with some good action and one-liners."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I liked the basic premise behind the movie and found it to be kind of cerebral, but there needed to be more about what she did in Peru that enabled her to be able to control more when she got back. Encountering her Mom and the reasoning behind her being in the Peruvian jungle when she was SO pregnant provided a needed piece of the story, but did not explain her being able to control her mind powers any better. The relationship between her and the girls was also kind of up in the air. It was good, but it left me wanting more back-story."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"I was not expecting it to be as good due to bad reviews so my expectations were low but great surprise it was good. I would have liked more action but it told a story. I recommend, it was definitely 100 times better than the other super hero Marvels movie."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,Just an other bad movie
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,Great for a Sony movie. I had low expectations and it exceeded them. The worst part was the villain. The guy's acting was horrid. I believe this is an instance in where the sequel could be better due to such a complicated setup/origin story.
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,Great to get a backstory for Madame Webb. Look forward to seeing the storyline develop.
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I liked the movie. It wasn't Marvel's best movie by far, but I liked better than the movie critics did. It pretty much kept my attention for the 2 hours. I hope it does get a sequel, because it definitely sets one up"
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,mal guion o mal direccion
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,Great Movie.  Loved the Storyline!!!!
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,Great storytelling and a very engaging plot throughout. This being a Marvel movie seemed a bit out of place but maybe a second one will happen. Created plenty of hate for the main villain but the star Dakota Johnson was amazing in her role. The ending for me just didn’t feel great but another movie or some way to tie together more would make it better.
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,It wasn't amazing but sets up something going forward.
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"Me gusto la pelicula muy entrenida. Es increible como uno se deja llevar por la rubia, demasiado hermosa uffffffffff"
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"Don't judge a movie off the reviews- surprisingly was a very good movie! Loved Dakota Johnson in this movie, storyline was pretty good, graphics in some parts could have been better but the predictive skills of Madam Webb really made this movie interesting to watch!"
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,Buddy lost to product placement. That’s tough
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,The movie was o.k. but I recommend watching it during a matinee or waiting for VOD or streaming.
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,One of the absolute worst superhero films I've ever seen. A pure embarrassment
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Story telling is dead. This movie could've been good, but the acting the story character development was so poor, had a hard time continuing to watch it would not recommend."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,I like the movie. I think the end could be more realistic. Looked like it is taken from X Man
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I think the movie itself is good and has a potential. The issue is that Dakota Johnson isn't a good actress, as well as Ezekiel actor. Many times an average movie can be elevated by excellent acting. Sidney Sweeney who is a very skilled actor, was holding back, I think to be on par with leads, not to outshine them. I did like the movie and the plot, just wish it had a better, more skilled and talented leads. Sorry, Dakota..."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,I can't believe this was allowed this to be published. This is The Room level bad.
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Only thing good about this movie is the ladies were pretty. Story was Eeh acting was blah and it just didn’t make much sense. Really didn’t think they could make a worse superhero movie than Morpheus, but they really said Hold my beer. "
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,A pior adaptação dos quadrinhos de todos os tempos.
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"Pókember rajongóknak kötelező, remelem a folytatásban ő is feltűnik."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"Nice movie, really liked it 👍"
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the movie.
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,Fantastic action packed movie!
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Good idea, bad script, poorly directed."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,That movie is terrible!!!
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It felt like lazy writing, i thought some of the action scenes were cringe, i still somewhat enjoyed it and i'd say its worth a watch."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie was fun and the 4 actresses complimented each other.  It was a plus to the Marvel brand. Stan Lee would have enjoyed it.
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Seeing as Birds of Prey and The Marvels had a good story and showed off the heroines that were in the movie, Madame Web falls short of that. There is clearly a story, but with the choppy editing, it's hard to tell what story the movie wanted to tell. With such a great cast it's sad to see Sony just throwing out yet another Spider-Man related film with no trajectory of where it may go. There is a lot of fixing this universe needs, but the question remains is it too late or can Sony course correct."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"More the theater than the movie, from the showtime there were 15 minutes of ads and then 20 minutes of previews. I don't mind ads before the showtime but didn't expect to wait 35m for the show to start."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,Internet hyperbole did not get to me and I had fun with this movie. Definitely felt more of a complete movie than Morbius.
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,The movie was slow and many scenes were not needed . The storyline seems to bounce around and the weird dynamic between her and the girls was awkward at best . It seemed to be nothing more than a time killer .
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"Es una buena película, vale la pena ir al cine y verla… muy buenas actuaciones y es un nuevo personaje, la verdad si me gustó! 7/10"
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"So fist off, I'm tires of all the negative flack that Sony and their movies have been getting.  You can't base every movie off of the original spiderman and/or infinity war.  They are all different movies with different stories to tell.  The cast in this movie is great together, all except for the main villain, they got his looks down but the acting could be a little better, just really really stiff, and sometimes a little awkward.  I think the entire conflict of the movie is a little forced, meaning the whole premise probably could have been figured out if they all met for tea, lol.  But pace is okay, sometimes a little fast, but for the most part easy to keep up with, and not too crazy.  I'm tired of going into super hero movies and it being so much going on I start getting a headache.  This movie does not do that.  Only time this occurs is during the final action scene and the sloppiness shows.  But overall very fun movie.  I saw it AMC Lazer, which sounds and looks amazing, and my wife and I were just about the only ones in the theater so it was nice no screaming kids or teenagers rather.  I recommend this movie for people wanting a nice pace, different from the norm super hero movie. Just don't go in with any expectations and sit back and enjoy the show.  Don't nit pick and you will enjoy just fine."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"in this film, the actress who plays this film looks very good but in terms of production, story & script this is really very bad & confusing in terms of story, the editing also seems sloppy which if you pay attention there are some parts that look strange, this is even worse from morbius."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,This is worse than morbius. HOW??!!
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"For the over saturated super hero movie world we find ourselves in, this was a refreshing take on Madame Web. Dakota Johnson was witty, funny, and compelling to watch. If your burnt out on corny super hero movies, give this one a try. Funny and worth an afternoon at the movies."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,The plot was so predictable and weak that it was the most comedic aspect of the movie.
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,This is a formula-made movie nothing else stands out.
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,It wasn't as bad as I expected saying that it is not good. Dakota Johnson in the lead has to put in one of the worst acting performances I have ever seen and the rest of the cast are not much better. There are massive bits of the plot that make no sense what so ever. I would say don't over think the movie and the glaring bits that are plain crazy and you might get a small bit of enjoyment out of it.
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"unknown caracter, bad history"
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed the movie, actually."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,"People have been wayyyy too harsh on this movie! It was actually quite entertaining. Yes there were some plot issues (as do most super hero movies), yes the CGI wasn't 100% at some points (the villains voice and dubbing was a bit off), and sure they could have done a better job at tying the movie into the rest of the MCU - but the movie itself was still enjoyable, I never had the urge to look at my watch to see what time it was, and the cast actually did a great job."
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,It had plenty of action but with her seeing into the future could be quite confusing
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"Muy buena película de introducción de personajes, familiar y un triller extremadamente disfrutable, te sumerge completamente, no es lo mismo a lo que marvel nos tiene acostumbrado, no más de lo mismo y eso se agradece."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movies plot is like a knock knock joke but the only part of the joke you are told is the part when they say ""knock knock"" then they start laughing. 

The moive the whole way through felt like it only had one this to build to, and that was how the cast become heroes. But we learn almost nothing about the powers, the characters, the spider people tribe, or the villan. There is action but that's it. The movie ends without so much as a hint to how the cast get their powers and just ends showing them in the future with powers and outfits. No explanation. 

What was there wasn't too bad, but there just wasn't much there."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,I absolutely adore Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (true to name). These guys are legends honestly. Single handedly bringing down sonys stand alone universe. Heroes. They may be forgotten but i will remember theyre sacrifice. One day a plaque will be put up in they're honor at the sony-marvel mega museum once they merge in 20 years.
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,I have signed up this to review this movie.  I saw this film in 4DX and even that did not make this film enjoyable. They have basically ripped off spiderman but made it 100x time worse in the process. I left the cinema feeling more depressed than when i arrived which i did not think was possible. I will have to book an extra session with my shrink!
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,Some questionable writing and corny flash forward scenes. Overall though I still liked it.
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"I was not perfect, but great cast and great acting. Better than all of the last movies from marvel"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,Watched it in IMAX. I enjoyed the film and characters. Glad I took the opportunity to watch it at the cinema.
"Feb 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Not as bad as people are saying, more a  boring movie then a bad one"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not as bad as expected, but still not great."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"So, I finally got around to watching ""Madame Web,"" in 4DX, nonetheless, and... yikes. It's like they were aiming for the stars but ended up somewhere in the stratosphere. Let's dive into the nitty-gritty.

First up, the CGI. Remember how epic the visuals were in movies like ""Into the Spider-Verse""? Yeah, keep those memories close because ""Madame Web"" won't be joining that hall of fame. The effects felt outdated, like something out of an early 2000s superhero flick. It's kind of a bummer because you go in expecting to be wowed but end up thinking about the good ol' days of CGI.

The ADR (automated dialogue replacement) was another head-scratcher. It's like watching a badly dubbed foreign movie where the lips and the words are in their own little worlds. It pulls you right out of the scene, especially during the moments that are supposed to hit hard. Honestly, it's pretty jarring.

And then there's the script. Oh, boy. It felt like someone let an AI loose, told it to watch a bunch of superhero movies, and then write one. The result? A mashup of clichés and awkward lines that had me cringing more than cheering. The characters deserve so much better!

One small silver lining? ""Madame Web"" isn't part of the MCU canon, which is kind of a relief. It's a Sony project that plays in the Marvel sandbox without affecting the bigger picture. So, at least there's no worry about it messing with your favorite MCU storylines.

All in all, ""Madame Web"" was a bit of a letdown. With the talent involved, I was hoping for a lot more. The CGI, ADR, and script issues were just too glaring to ignore. It's a shame because the concept had so much potential. But hey, not every swing is going to be a home run, right?

In any case, it's one of those movies you might watch just to say you did, or maybe to appreciate the effort. Just keep your expectations in check!"
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,Was fantastic loved the special effects very awesome and exciting hope they make another movie
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The movie was action filled, which I liked  but was a little far-fetched."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The plot was alright, the special effects were lacking but that's pretty typical with movies nowadays, the acting and dialog were absolutely repulsive to the point that anything that was almost good didn't even matter, it wad almost the first movie I've ever walked out of, did nod off a couple of times"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The amount of laugh out loud moments in the last third, despite being joke free, add an extra half star but this one lives up to the rep of being one of the worst movies ever made"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,Lost 2 hours of my life I won’t get back
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,Can we give 0 stars?
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"when she said ""it's morbin time"" I gasped. i thought it wasn't possible to have such a creative line be expressed directly to the camera in a way where the audience felt something. the ones of people in the audience got out of their chairs and started hitting the griddy all over the theater, so much so that the disco lights turned on and we all started to conga out of the theater towards the nearest exit so we didn't have to watch the movie anymore. 0.000000001/10"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's not too bad, but it's not fantastic ether. Like it's just fine, it's pretty solid. I would say it's the best Sony Spider-Man unverse movie, but that's not saying much. Overall, I would give it a 7/10."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,Madame Web was not what I was hoping for this was not a good marvel or spider man movie.
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,Desperdício de tempo assistir essa porcaria..
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"I feel bad that this movies is receiving really bad reviews.  It was entertaining and Dakota was quite funny in an unintentional manner. Though, I did fell that the villain’s dialogue was not the best.  His actions sequences was cool and creepy.  Give this movie an honest chance and check it out.  The family and I enjoyed it, would like a sequel to follow up."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,I went in with low expectations and this is the first time I feel like I deserved a refund for my ticket. Since I've seen the movie I have seen promos where they literally just say hey come see these beautiful girls on the big screen and it's very creepy how they're doing all this.
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie was 10/10. It changed my life forever! Best comic book movie since Ryan Reynolds' Green Lantern movie! I can't fathom the awesomeness that this movie has! You need to watch it right now! This is cinema. Also, the movie sucked big, gurthy, veiny dick."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web is so bad, where does one begin? First and foremost, Dakota Johnson is just not a good actress. Let's get real, she's gotten to where she is because of her Nepo baby status. The success of those dreadful Fifty Shades of Grey films had very little to do with with Johnson or her acting, it was because the books were fan favorites (the last film was the lowest grossing in the trilogy). Also, whoever wrote the script for Madame Web should never write another script again. The dialogue was trite, the storyline was boring and it was directed and shot like it was amateur hour on an abandoned studio backlot. Overall Madame Web felt super-low budget. I've seen student films that were way better than this nonsense. I don't always agree with critics, but on this disaster of a film, they are spot-on. Madame Web has no redeeming qualities at all. If your curiosity gets the better of you, just wait until it's on a streamer, but by no means spend your hard-earned money on it. Technically Madame Web is part of the larger Spider-Man cinematic multiverse, so how on earth did they get this film so wrong with an $80 million budget??"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A mediocre movie. Not good, but not really bad. The dialog is atrocious at times and something was seriously wrong with the audio of Ezekiel Sims (sounds like the original audio was dubbed over, badly). 

But still a movie that is entertaining enough."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Horrible. Horrible acting. I understand it was an intro but, what an horrible Marvel movie. I should watched the Bob Marley:One Love. It was so cheesy. Every actor Horrible."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I would give this a negative rating if I could.  I am not one to walk out of movies, but it seriously crossed my mind several times.  The constant flash-forwards (if you want to call them that) were confusing and made it hard to follow.  Dakota Johnson's acting was atrocious at best.  She duped Sony on this one.  Who at Sony watched this and said, ""Yeah, this is great, release it""?  That indeed proved to be a lie!  It was not great and should have never left the studio; maybe it needed to be on the studio floor."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,Everything would be better if Spider-Man participated in these movies...
"Feb 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Very slow. Dakota did a good job and is a great actress.  However, the story was just blah and even more blah.  I was really disappointed there wasnt any kind of preview like Marvel usually does at the end of the move but I really understand why since the movie passed the time."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"An utterly unnecessary entry in the superhero genre, based loosely on a rather obscure Marvel character.
If you bring very low expectations, the movie is watchable. Add a star if youre a fan of Dakota Johnson or Sidney Sweeney. Note: there are no Bonus Scenes in the end credits."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I'm genuinely shocked that people are shocked, mad, and baffled that this movie is genuinely this bad.

My full video review can be found here: youtu.be/Q9oPCwzvbJA?si=UwBGPHPEefncdnzr

However, I will say the ONE trailer they put out a couple of months ago is the best version of this movie you will find. Plus, you won't have to endure 2 hours just to get to the worst crime of all: Madame Web's suit [THOSE. GLASSES. GIVES. ME. NIGHTMARES.] Be glad none of the marketing has shown you her ""god-form"" because I truly think my amygdala is forever broken.

Thank you, Sony, thank you.

[Oh, by the way, don't take your date to this—okay, imma go eat Berry Colossal Crunch in bed & watch The Incredibles now]"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,Plot line jumped and meandered.  Would have made a better TV show than a movie.
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was not horrible! I expected a flop, but was pleasantly surprised!"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Story was intruiging with the exception of a few very unbeleivable situations. Like driving a stolen damaged cab with no license plates in NY city for days  without being pulled over. But then the whole   movie is about a suspension of reality and should be enjoyed for the creativity of the story,"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Ouch what a waste of money ... when one of the only positive thing to say about your movie is that Toxic from Britney Spears played for like 5 minutes, it's really rough 🤯!"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Legalzinho, não prometeu nada e não entregou nada, um filme q ninguém pediu. Mas minha filha de 11 anos gostou."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Actually, the cast was Ok. but the story was so drag and no reason. just to make a spidy movie and make it . y don't they polish the next spiderman and add these cast inside"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This was a few million more dollars stuffed into a CW tv episode at best . 
 If it weren't for movies like Oppenheimer , this movie is the movie i would choose as the poster film for everything wrong with modern cinema .  I cant fathom how after over a hundred years of movie making, they still pump out low grade , lazy, lack of love directing like this .  The dialog is robotic and uncomfortably predictable .  ..... I can actually go on and on but im choosing to not give this horrible film another ounce of my energy"
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,It's a good superhero movie. It focuses on the beginning It's a good superhero movie. It focuses on the origin of the main character.of the main character.
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is a movie that has been unfairly criticized, seemingly because Sony didn't invest enough in PR, resulting in an undeservedly negative reception. Personally, I genuinely enjoyed the film for its heartfelt storytelling of the protagonist, which is a touching and relatable tale of an ordinary civilian heroine told from a female perspective, evoking both empathy and tears. The performances of the three young actresses were commendable, and I eagerly anticipate the chance to see their characters return in future installments. A rare and valuable female-led film.  Don't miss it!"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I'm not sure who at Sony thinks these are good ideas.  As soon as I saw Dakota Johnson, I was disinterested.  She can't act her way out of a paper bag.  To put her at the forefront of a Spider-Man related series?!  What were you thinking SONY?  Tired of these run of the mill comic movies.  Even the actual Marvel Studios is failing miserably right now.  YOU NEED A LONG STORY ARC!!  No one cares about origin stories anymore.  If you want to introduce new characters, do it in a longer arc.  The whole comic book superhero movie world right now is a mess with no real direction.  The luster is gone.  Be creative or just don't make the movie.  This one is not worth the investment."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,The dialogue in this movie was so poor I had to laugh out loud. That was how bad this movie was. It had some interesting ideas that's why I gave it 1 star.
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,loved it! I always enjoy my childhood comic books come to life! Story and characters and everything was excellent!
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Quando você acha que não existe a possibilidade de ficar pior, eles lançam essa porcaria PARABÉNS SONY!"
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"Film gradevole e che passa alla svelta, sinceramente non capisco tutte queste critiche."
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great movie, awesome graphics"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I think it is not as bad as others commented.
Personally, Madame Web is better than The Marvels and Eternals.

Thank you"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,Ridiculous costumes. Stupid dialogues. Terrible acting. Hollywood is dead.
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I didn't have Rottem Tomato account, but I created one just to post this comment. I needed to tell everyone to avoid this film, because it wasted my valuable 2 hours and money on IMAX. This film didn't deserve to be on IMAX. IT WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF MY TIME AND MONEY. I want a refund!!!! It would have been a teeny little better if Dakota Johnson had shown some skin, but NO! It felt like I was taken through a two-hour long teaser. I am freakin' mad!"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,Worst Marvel film ever. It's simply just a bad movie.
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Is ""Madame Web"" a good movie? No."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I mean, they don't even try anymore, just sad!"
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was phenomenal, and its kind of upsetting to see this kind of hate on the movie. I question whether or not anyone who is tearing it down actually watched the movie!"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was boring and honestly didn't make much sense.
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,It's really not bad.
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,not good at all there was no way to like this
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"I saw it before reading the critics reviews and thought it was a fun superhero-esque movie. The last 10 minutes did seem a bit janky but the cast were great throughout and I definitely don't begrudge having paid to see it in the cinema.

Having now read the reviews, I'm confused where all the hate has come from. It's not that bad!"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,What the hell was I even doing in this theater after 30 mins? I was getting The Marvel's vibe but only creepy crawly vibes. This wasn't bad it was horrific to where I actually almost asked for my money back. I never write reviews and and can be well imagine my lackluster writing skills. Terrible
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I think that if Sony wants their spider-verse movies to succeed, they need to re-read the Disney playbook. Venom is single handedly holding the SSU up."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,damn that was bad. dont watch it. trust me. dogshit
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Has no story and it is misleading in so many ways, what a waste of time and money smh"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,This was the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I will never get back the time or money that I spent on this disgusting and horrifying experience of what they call a movie I would rather eat feces Than to ever see this movie ever again. The actors should be ashamed for the disgrace that this movie is. Don’t watch it. This is ass.
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,Horrible script. No chemistry between the actors. 
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"I liked Madame Web it is a good movie with a storyline that does its job to introduce her and the other ladies. The authenticity of the 2003 era was fun to see and Dakota Johnson's performance shine and enjoyed seeing her on the screen. 

I loved the birth of Peter Parker and seeing a young Uncle Ben. I know there is a lot of reviews out there but I am a fan of origin stories and I love and have an appreciation for a movie that allows me to connect the dots. 

I can't wait to see more from this talented cast and crew! I hope they continue it. 🕸️ give it a chance!"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It was so bad. Everything: cast, acting, direction, script. Awful."
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,Ending was bad. Movie was good
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,one of the worst movie of super hero genre
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I liked the cast… tbh I have no idea where to start… First, the audio issues were very distracting from an already mediocre film; this took the film from mediocre to down right garbage. The main villains lines did not match up with the words coming out of his mouth. For a company this big, that should not be happening. Also, in certain areas of this film you could tell it was voiced over due to the lack of atmosphere (idk the technical stuff) in the sound. For example, there was a bit of an echo when they were in the cab I believe. Moving on, the three (spider) girls did not have complex personalities. Very much what you see is what you get. It felt way too power ranger-y. Interestingly convenient how all of them have no parents….not a trope I'm fond of, but it can slide. Moving on to the main actress, Dakota, I found her acting very bland.  She was funny during her dry humor scenes, which I think she shines best at, but for a ""superhero"" movie (if we can even call it that), she was not meant for this role. My next major issue with this movie is the lack of
Cool powers we get to see, since most of the marketing aims at showing these girls in spider suits. The pacing with this movie was also an issue. I find that theres this quick switch between ‘Cassie' not being able to control her powers, to her in the span of one day, being able to master her powers is pretty lazy. Usually theres some sort of training montage for stuff like that, but i guess by the end of filming, they already knew they put too much money into a big garbage can. Not to mention, what happened to Cassie being aired on the news for ""abducting"" these girls. How on earth do they live with her and go to school?? Im mortified at whats coming next from this Sony/weird marvel deal."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Dakota Johnson plays a very unlikeable character in this film, and she's supposed to be the protagonist which makes no sense. A tip for the director: Make the leading actor/actress someone you want to root for, not someone you want to root against. The bad guy did a good job in his role, as did the three teenage girls in their roles, but the movie as a whole stunk. Thumbs down."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Regrettably, this film consistently grapples to establish a coherent narrative, with its origin story proving notably deficient. It represents yet another unsuccessful endeavor by Sony's executives to capitalize on the Spider-Man universe without adequately acknowledging its foundational elements."
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,Movie was great awesome just didn’t like the ending other than that recommend it.
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,One of the worst marvel movies I watched. Should of watch Aqua Man. Maybe parents with kids 9 and up would enjoy this movie. 
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,Terrible Movie! The story was mess and lacking.
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,solo por tener relación con spiderman no significa que es suficiente y parece que eso pensaron no tiene nada que aportar
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I see what the producers/writers were trying to do but the story line was too weak. The writers threw believability out the window when these three teenagers just followed Casey with very few questions. And even the questions they asked were lame. For Casey to leave them in the woods by themselves for three hours was almost laughable. And then when the mom-to-be had to go to the hospital, the girls left a place where they had been safe for a week for no good reason. The sequel if there is one will probably be pathetic. Rather it is or not, I will not spend a dime to see it.

The one good point is Dakota is HOT!"
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,great movie!  I can't wait for the sequel
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie was so amazing to me and I love their costumes especially Madame webs love the red I was A little sad that she went flying, but I think it really suits her and I still love her blind or not blind"
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"First time giving my opinion about a movie or making a movie review, and I give #MadameWeb🕸️🕷️ a 9/10 as it was an awesome origin story. Born in 1973 myself, this movie I feel was very underrated and definitely a date type of movie!!! 🍿🎥👌🏽👌🏽

People forget to just enjoy a good movie. Don't overthink it, just watch the 🎥, eat your 🍿 and realize #DakotaJohnson as #CassieWeb🕸️ was a great acting choice. 

Also the 3 actresses including #IsabellaMerced  worked very hard to create a movie 🍿🎥 and I recommend this movie, not for what people are expecting to see, but what it actually is... an origin story for Madame Web 🕸️🕷️GREAT MOVIE!!!

The fighting sequences in the film is exactly what I wanted to see. I wasn't expecting to see Spider-Man, just how Cassie became Madame Web, how she guided the 3 heroines into their destiny way before Spider-Man was to become a NY comic book hero meets the big screen box office icon. #MadameWeb "
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"Good movie, great cast, kid appropriate."
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"Not sure why it got a lot of hate, has a great backstory to the origin of the character. Acting was great as expected from marvel related movies."
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"Best Story, i like this cool concept,"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,Just felt like they could’ve change some things and add to it but overall 6/10
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,This is not you're tipical superheroe movie but instead the give a suspense-superoheroe genre. I enjoyed every plot twist.
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"Just to much unfair criticism, good story, flowed well, acting was fine, definitely entertaining"
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was a good time.  There was a bit left unexplained but since it felt  like the start of a bunch of them, I expected some things to remain open for the future.  Overall I enjoyed the pacing and watching a super hero film where you didn't need to watch a million tv series to follow along."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Cortito y al pie, una verga"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Just got out from the movie thought the camera work was made by a YouTuber with a zoom lens and lines of dialogue could have been written better to be less corny. In the end it wasn't a bad move(not saying it was a good movie), if it wasn't a ""Spider-Man"" movie would have given it a better rating, but since it is horrible Spider-Man movie(it was somewhat bearable). Wouldn't watch again though it's definitely a one time watch."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,Sony should leave spider verse alone.
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,I liked it when it ended and disliked it from the beginning. Made no sense.
"Feb 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,It was better than I anticipated. I think the movie was way better than the marvels. The movie suffered from a horrible trailer and some bad choices. I think she deserved better than this and I fear these characters will never be revisited again.
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"Intriguing story, good acting and good special effects! Reminded me of Spider-Man. I would’ve liked to have seen an after credits trailer though."
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"I thought it was great! Didn’t have too much relation to the comics, but still kept my attention."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,A movie that looked ok in the trailer but was so slow I fell asleep at times. I blame this on the writers and directors. The actors and actresses were decent considering the train wreck of a script they were dealing with. I have no issues with them. With the villan all we get out of the story is he has a vision of three teens that steal his spider or do harm to him but that is it. It was a cat and mouse story the whole film. Something that should have been 40 minutes in the movie they extended to a 2hr train wreck of a movie. None of the characters were really fleshed out. We dont see Madame Web in costume or do anything really heroic till the end of the film when we see her in a wheel chair and is blind. I'm more curious how the girls get there powers? The big thing to is why wasn't it till the end of the film till we see them in costume? Its a Marvel Comics movie at some point we should have seen them in mid film using their powers and in costume. Not the las 5 min of it. It makes me really worrie what theyre going to do wit Kraven the hunter.
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"I like this movie, has a funny interaction with the tennager and theirs rebel heart. It has some scenes of introspective and follow the damage make to her mom."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Not the greatest film of all time but i dont fine it bad, sometimes the cgi looks weird and ceartain scenes are meh, but for me is an enjoyable movie and not as bad"
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie was great, some wired moments. But the story was awesome. Like the setting."
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great movie, kept my interest through the story line. It was a great origin story. Loved the Female cast. Dakota was fantastic."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I disagree with the horrible reviews. It
was nowhere near as bad as some reviews made it out to be. Sure there were some aspects that were patently ridiculous but, hello Dr Strange 2, Thor Love and Thunder, Ant Man Quantimania. Not meant to be over analyzed. It was entertaining at least."
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was a superhero movie. It was fun, good action, good scenes. I don't know why so much hate for this film"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,"To be fair, I never have tried to climb a wall."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,It’s not even fun bad 🤦🏽‍♂️
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,Entertaining and action packed when you least expected. The ending was a little dull and main character should have had a better outcome. Still worth checking out.
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,is there a way to put negative stars? There needs be deleted out of my brain.  Very dumb movie all around. terrible
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I loved this movie in the same exact way I loved fast x. It's so unintentionally funny that I'm glad I saw it. Nothing in this movie makes sense. So many things happen off screen, the villain is just atrocious. He's so bad that there's more than a handful of times when he's not even saying whatever he originally said. Dakota Johnson is Hollywood nepotism at its finest. It's almost impossible to believe that she's the lead actress in a movie and was probably paid at least a million dollars for this movie. Hollywood makes no sense. It's so goofy and stupid that it's hilarious."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,"es una película genérica que cumple en presentar al personaje, disculpen quien es fan de este personaje? es una historia que entretiene y nos presenta quien es y cual es su poder..."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"nah man, the film's delivery is freaky stiff, the story telling is bland, the antagonist's background isn't really explored, even though the cast is already wow"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie was plain awful!!  You sitting there waiting for them to get powers and fight back. There was nothing. The worst superhero movie I've ever seen. I wouldn't recommend to watch it on streaming when it happens. An absolute waste of my time.  How can you love a Superhero movie, when there was no Superhero? Duh!!"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not a real movie. Going into it I did not know what the plot was and leaving I was even more confused. The camera work is what I imagine Madame Webb sees when glimpsing the future. The only glimmer of hope was when I thought I saw Morbius in the background, but alas, I’ve was not there."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,"If they still had double features , it would make a good B side. I had a good time."
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,It was a decent film! Not perfect but enjoyed by my daughters!
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,Absolute loved it! Worth seeing in theater.
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"I honestly don't understand why so many critics are panning post Avenger super hero movies (marvel and dc) and constantly compare them to Avenger level hype. News flash, there were MANY movies prior to avengers to build up to the story we saw which was broken up into multiple movies itself. 

Movies like this, tge marvels etc. are fun and full movies to enjoy that are super hero centric with fun cgi moments and character building. They've had great performances and are simply being gunned down by comparison to movies that took decades to build up to. 

I found all the leading ladies performances enjoyable, the action scenes fun and the use of madame webs powers very interesting. 

I truly hope that they're able to secure Dakota for future projects, perhaps movies that are part of the greater marvel universe, which it seems people are more happy to give 100% ratings to.  I really don't get the critic scores and I personally feel this movie (among others) shouldn't be sitting below 80%. 

I hope in time more people see this movie, even if it doesnt recoup costs for Sony. But, perhaps gives the ability for the characters to live on in live action. 

Worth a rent/stream for sure if you're not sold. Still worth a fun matinee priced movie for sure."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,Not only the worst spider verse movie but the worst movie ever. If I could give it zero stars  I would.
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It was bad, so very bad. You thought Morbius was bad, this is even worse. The writing was bad, the ADR (additional dialogue recording) was bad and didn't match the actors mouth movements, it feels like the people who made this movie kind of wanted it to be a horror movie but didn't really commit to it. It also felt like Sony just don't care about these characters, all they're doing is sticking to a contractual agreement that says they have to release a Spider-Man / Spider-Man character movie every 5 years and 9 months otherwise the rights go back to then Marvel Entertainment which is know Marvel Studios. Sony please stop."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,Even if I don't particularly like a movie I generally can get some enjoyment out of seeing it a the movies. Not so much this time.
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"Muitos falaram mal do filme
Mas superou minhas espectativas, história boa e personagens legais 
Valeu muito a pena assistir esse filme"
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,I like it had action comedy and talks about spider man without talking about it I thought it awesome so did my friend I will watch it again
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great origin story. I actually enjoyed the storyline. Chemistry and acting was great. Overall, a fun movie worth a second watch. I hope the powers that be ignore the hateful comments and continue to build from this movie because I'm very much looking forward to their evolution as superheroes!"
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"I love it!!! It's funny, witty , well-written and also some emotional scenes are good. It's not your regular marvel movie if you're expecting some epic battle… it's not that but it's still a good movie to watch. I hope they'll make a part 2."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Sinceramente, es una película ""Divertida/Entretenida/Disfrutable"" y si tienen la oportunidad de vivir la experiencia en 4DX mucho mejor."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"To be honest, this movie was actually very good. If you liked the Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies, you will definitely like this. I did very much so. The problem is that the mainstream critics are nowadays usually off about lots of things, and if you're movie doesn't have explicit content, they will not give you a good review. Further, many of the user critics are part of the Tik Tok generation and have no patience for anything these days. If you grew up in the 90s, you will definitely like this movie."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,It was great love it wasn’t bad as people say. I was so intrigued with the clairvoyance she experienced and the the girls were great when they were together a great movie
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Es una historia de origen entretenida como para verla un domingo, la ví con mi esposa y mi hija, la trama nos mantuvo espectantes de su desenlace."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Loved the suspense and the action , great actress!"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It's definitely one of the worse superhero films, characters aren't well known, or interesting. Plot isn't well done, major fail for Sony and their Spiderman films. When the market has been saturated with superhero films, you have to bring something special, this definitely is it!"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"the acting was good, the girls were highly lovable,  but the writers wrote there hero and villian to both have highly questionable behaviors and motivations. there was too many plot wholes and fuzzy logic to fully enjoy this super hero movie with the least super hero-ing."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,Classic Marvel. Not bad at all. Recommend for teens and kids.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Terrible movie. Boring, shallow plot, subpar acting, cheesy lines, no character development and the characters themselves are poorly written and acted. Oof, that was rotten."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I'm sorry :(( I don't want so say it's bad, what I will say is I was extremely disappointed and that's hard for me cause I was really looking forward to this after discharging from the hospital. The story just feels forced and you can tell the actors knew their lies were just lines. please go see somthing else and wait for this when it's streamable. You'll feel more fulfilled watching literally anything else in theaters. Sorry to anyone feeling let down by reading this.. just being honest :("
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"what a waste of time the characters don't grow at all as a person, it's horrible how they make the protagonists complain all the time the villain is very stupid in scene 3 where he comes out and repeats ""I have to kill them"" as if he hadn't done it many times before the cgi is terrible"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This is a solid entry into the Sony Marvel Universe.  As origin stories go, this is a great stand alone movie that sets up some great characters and also ties into Spider-Man."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,I would like to see more. Good understandable story line. I did not see the comic book
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I gave the movie a chance because wasnt Disney.  Another all females cast nothing wrong with it. Hollywood need to understand if are going to keep doing this kind of movies need to be ready for more flops. Really the movie is a mess. Mention what part and you can agree is bad. Scripot, action and FX. All are awful."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I don’t mean to be rude, but this movie is a total waste of time and money,  it is worst Marvel movie ever being produce."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"There is a new gold standard in filmmaking, and it is Madame Web.  The makers of Madame Web put on an absolute clinic with the creation of this masterpiece that the likes of Tarantino, Scorsese, Spielberg and Wiseau and Breen should study and attempt to emulate.  USC film school should have an entire class - nay, SEMESTER dedicated to the study and analysis of this next evolutionary step in the art of filmmaking.  If Kubrick and Hitchcock were alive, they would weep at their wasted years and failures upon viewing this masterclass and peak of cinematic culture.  

As a viewer, Madame Web was not a movie, but an experience.  Just watching this grand treasure on the silver screen was the closest that most of us will ever be to being in the presence of true greatness and genius.  Madame Web should be shown in the Louvre at all times.  Temples should be erected where those of us so touched, so moved by this experience can go to pay our respects, or perhaps dedicate our lives to a humble existence of servitude and deep reflection on the message, lessons, and teachings shared by director S.J. Clarkson in this new form of enlightenment.

I am weeping at the beauty of what Sony Pictures has created and shared with all of us, wealthy and poor, young and old alike. My life will never be the same.  We are not worthy."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Good plot. Parts felt drawn out, and some parts felt rushed. But overall a really good story."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I'm usually not a fan of Marvel superhero movies but I kind of enjoyed this. There is no real depth to any of the characters but that's par for the course with comic book movies. At times I enjoyed the tension build in act two but found it hard not to ignore that there were no reproductions from stealing a cab and driving around without plates, or how the time line jumps by weeks in the blink of an eye. Enjoyably passed the time on a rainy afternoon and made me laugh in the right moments."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"I don’t know why this movie has such a low rating. Me and my family loved it! It was funny, adventurous, action packed, and heart warming. We absolutely loved it and even saw it twice. Acting is great and the story line kept us hooked. Definitely a must see! "
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Sony does love money, don't they? There are fewer companies that I believe more shamelessly vie for the cash they believe is burning a hole in the pockets of superhero fans than the reluctant marriage of Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures. Quality and care are often sacrificed in favor of creating the next comic book movie blockbuster.

As a longtime Spider-Man fan, its almost painful to say that watching Madame Web was a slog. The existence of Madame Web's powers are almost completely absent, with little more to show for it than action sequences that stop and start at a whiplash-inducing pace, punctuated by editing that is nauseating as it is annoying. This pace is done no favors by the nonrhythmic and soulless plot, with its mere reason for being seems to be to serve as a precursor to another (hopefully better) movie. I was hoping this movie's saving grace would be its cast, which was a naive assumption. Almost all of the performances were awkward, flaccid, and cringe, with its cast desperately trying to find the pulse of this cadaver.

I will say that Adam Scott's performance as Ben Parker stood out to me. I've always admired Scott's loveable dork persona which he embodies in many of his roles, and I found myself drawn to this kind, funny, and younger version of Ben. He summoned a good couple of laughs from me, which offered more for the movie than any of its other weird, ill-timed quips.

I want to say I'm disappointed, but I'm not. This kind of glib storytelling is now par for the course for the superhero genre. Whether or not Madame Web was trying to stand out or settle for a cash-in is unclear. Maybe in 10 years this will become a cult classic among Spidey fans, but for now, it's a forgettable, spiritless embarrassment."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It wasn’t spider man, but it wasn’t the green lantern either it was ight  kinda cool fight scene’s but I honestly couldn’t help but laugh at some points of the plot it was so ehh not that substantial. But Johnson have it her all and she did a great job and she’s very pretty"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I really wanted this to be good. I like Dakota Johnson and thought she might bring an interesting angle to a new character. Thing is, the plot is incoherent - I was completely lost as to what was going on - I think the editing is to blame as characters jumped around a scene without continuity. Such a shame!"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Russ review - Madame Web Bad script right from the start. Lots of telling and not showing. The way that Dakota Johnson’s dialog is written and acted seems like this was her character’s (Cassie) first day as a human at the beginning of the film. Adam Scott portrays the only believable character. His ability to make that possible with bad dialog reminds me of Harrison Ford in the original Star Wars. Supposedly Cassie is a paramedic with the fire department. I’ve been a firefighter and a medical first responder. She seems like she has NO CLUE how to do her job. The situations that happen with the “bad guy” to make us realize he is the bad guy are nonsensical and contrived. Also, the bad guy sounds like all his dialog is re-recorded during post production. His lips are hardly ever visible and when they are. They barely move. It’s really weird. In fact there are a lot of characters speaking with their back toward the camera where you can tell it wasn’t spoken on the day. Frenetic blurry quick cuts to portray “action” in scenes that don’t make sense to be shot that way. I can appreciate the intended story, but it’s put together poorly. It saddens me because I was REALLY hoping this would be good. We don’t get to actually have any sympathy or empathy for characters. Everything is explained about the characters. Like they read the description off the call sheet and instead of using it as motivation for HOW to portray their characters, hey simply said it out loud. The movie prominently displays Mountain Dew and Pepsi, so that’s cool I guess. "
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The film is a mess, the characters especially the three girls are so annoying and they are future superheroes? One says ""I don't need anyone taking care of me."" Well you kinda do idiot the villain has tried to kill you twice! Who ever wrote this mess needs to apologize and try harder, I was cheering on the villain in this film and in terms of acting Adam Scott is the only one putting in any effort, he deserves better."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"All in all I thought it was an enjoyable film. Was it perfect, no, but what movie is. If I’m going to see a superhero movie, I tend to suspend reality while watching. I go to enjoy myself, and not look for every plot hole. Just go watch the movie, grab some popcorn, and relax. Don’t look for something to complain about. It’s not going to win any major awards, but rarely do superhero movies ever do."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie. My daughter and I loved it. Ignore the critics and enjoy it. Unless you normally agree with them 😂. I  find them to be mostly wrong. Go with the 55% who liked it.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Great new Marvel hero Plenty of action
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,why did sony pick her?  she is a really really opscre marvel hero mostly because most people who watch movies don´t read comics
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Excellent story and acting. Glad I saw this superhero movie which had very minimal CGI for once. Dakota Johnson had a great performance aling with the rest of the cast. Cannot wait to see the sequel.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,I especially liked the lead character.  There was plenty of action in the movie but it seemed like it used Spiderman to try a different play on spiders. Seemed obvious that the girls will be returning as superheros in the future.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this movie, the action was great and I loved the back story that was given"
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"I thought it was a great entertaining movie all the way around. People tend to forget that even though a movie could be tied to a book or comic book it doesn't necessarily mean it has to follow it in purity. There are plenty of people that just want to see a movie and be entertained, not disseminate it like the ""thirty-something"" year old critics we see here, who feel their childhood dreams have been brutally smashed because it is not replicating the greatest of detail those weekly ""allowance money"" comic books they poured over, while sipping their Capri sun's and feeding their Tamagotchi, happily surrounded by their ""participation trophies"". They are probably still fondly holding on to their 24K-gold-plated-Mewtwo-Burger-King-kids-meal-Pokémon card and sweetly whispering ""Someday little buddy, you'll be worth something."" It's ok kids, mom still loves you and you're the greatest!"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,The first movie I walked out on in years. Absolute trash.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Not very interesting
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Finally a decent introduction of a new character! I would like to see a more invested Johnson in expressing Cassie's feelings and I hope in the future it'll better. A little disappointed for the absence of post-movie and post-credit scenes but that's ok.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,This is a great film.  I have no idea why the critics have scored it so low.  I really enjoyed it.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"I went and watched this with my kids ranging in age from 9-17. All of us thought this was a really good movie. I don't see where some of the criticism on confusing plot or lack of action is coming from. The characters all have good story arc's, the bad guy does a reasonable good job being a bad guy especially when seen through the glimpses that Madame Web gets. I think Dakota Johnson does a good job with the role and gives a good performance as the lead character. I think they did rush past some of the better easter eggs in the movie which would have been great if they expanded on those a little more. The only thing I wasn't real clear on was her state at the end of the film, which I won't ruin here. All in all, if you really like Marvel movies or at least Sony Spider-man flicks, then I think this is a really good movie."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Fantastic film... I was glued to my seat the whole time.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Pretty solid film. Required a bit of extreme suspension of disbelief at points: not superhero stuff where you'd expect it, but things like a flickering neon sign completely broken off its power supply.

I felt the story was a little off the beaten path from other superhero films, and it added some welcome originality.

Dakota Johnson did a great job in the lead role, playing the kind of discombobulated discoverer of her powers and becoming more and more competent over time. The three girls were written a bit two-dimensional but played really well by their actors. 

Overall, I'd recommend the film. Just think of it as a fun ride and don't be overly analytical or critical."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Hey Sony I'm gonna pitch a concept that you might pay a couple of million for.... seeing as how you haven't been able to come up with it yourselves.

Make a good movie....  that's it.
Even great is shooting a little high at this point.  Your getting so that what ever marvel character your involved with isn't going to bring in any money at all if your names attached to it with such poor story telling and weak writers attached.

The screen writers and producers need another job other than this. This was horrible!
The idea is good and that's about it on this one.  The movie makes no since and is very boring and underwhelming. The script is horrible. Writers move the story for goodness sakes it's stagnant.  And more importantly end up somewhere.  All the blame is on the higher ups on this one, you can tell by all that was allowed to be released."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,What was that? For what? Wretched idea
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,The internet can be lame. It becomes the cool thing to attack Sony Spider-Man spin off movies so people jump on the band wagon. Movie is nowhere near atrocious. It's a fine fun movie.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This is just too bad to put into words, arguably worse than the 2015 Fan4stic."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"2000s comic book movie. No it's not the MCU. No it's not the ‘worst comic book movie yet'. Very convinced people are jumping on this because it's popular to hate Sony's superhero movies. It was fun, it reminded me of when superhero movies were fun and simple. It was enjoyable….for the most part.

There was some very awful dialogue, and some even worst acting, specifically from the villain. What was that? Did they dub the whole thing? It was actually unbearable to watch that guy. I can't praise it for that, the movie overall isn't great but it's not as bad as people are saying either. Just maybe Sony should watch the movie before they release it next time?"
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"It feels like on purpose they want this movie to bomb at the box office (like an evil plan or something), but for me and my family it was an absolute must see! Such an amazing acting from Dakota, very good CGIs (not like some recent much bigger budget movies) and a good story line! 

Don't listen to people and news around the world, this movie is good entertainment! Highly recommended!"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"CGI is the worst I've seen in the last few years. The best part of the movie is Dakota Johnson and her acting. I understand that Ezekiel comes from a poor family, but that's not enough reason to be a bad person."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Too many plot holes, misleading advertising (trailer), is there going to be a director's cut to fill them? I hope so, the special effects were decent (Thanks, movie gods!) but as mediocre as it was, I preferred this to the latest ""Aquaman"" where I actually left the theater."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,Not as terrible as critics say. It is a little slow at some points but it was an overall enjoyable movie.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,I went in thinking it would be a fun bad movie but it was funny how bad it was.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie is decent. Idk why people are giving these reviews. It’s a super hero movie not The Green Mile or Good Will Hunting. Go watch it for yourself.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Don't get me wrong: this movie is horrible. The writing is terrible, the directing is choppy, and Dakota Johnson is completely incapable of displaying any sort of passion (ironic, isn't it?), but it's the sort of movie that's extremely fun to make fun of with your friends. I'd wait for it to be on streaming, but it's still worth checking out."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It wasn't great but what can be expected from a lesser known (Super?)hero origin story. It did what it had to do and introduced Madam Web to the audience. She can definitely play a supporting role for Spiderman films but shouldn't have a sequel. (Not that it would). 
The film itself reminded me of a made for tv movie with 90's vibes. Still worth a watch but don't go out of your way for it."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This movie isn't as bad as the critics say. Yes, there are plot holes; yes, there is bad dialogue; but not all comic book movies are going to reach the high bar set by the OG MCU. I walked out of it having enjoyed myself and talking with my family about the Spiderverse Easter eggs in the film. It was fun, the acting (outside of the main villain) was good, and I'd see it again."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It has its faults, but it's still a fun ride."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I usually can't watch movies because the plots stress me out, but I got through this no problem. There were like 50 plotlines and 0 made sense. There was almost no character development, and a lot of Pepsi product placement. The production is giving Twilight in a bad way. I'm giving it 2 stars because it fits into the category: it's so bad it's good. Please go watch this film, it's a hoot and a half."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Half a star in generous.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,The actresses play their roles so bad.. couldn't believe my eyes in the cinema..
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,It's so bad. So so bad.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,I wouldn’t even give it half a star ! Horrible writing…horrible script…the execution of the movie just alll of it was bad just bad.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"A fun, cute movie but they showed the main character giving a cat milk but cats are actually lactose intolerant!!"
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Si te sientes agotado y cansado de otra película de superhéroes, dale una oportunidad a Madame Web."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Loved this Marvel movie! My whole family went and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. Great story line . Loved Dakota Johnson in this role. If you enjoy Marvel movies it’s a must see!
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The first half was so painful that for the first time in my life, I wanted to get out and leave. Especially after the villain is revealed. The overall dialogue is the worst and most basic. The villain just repeats himself the whole time. Dakota is adorable, but even she looks like she can't believe how bad the script is."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Loved the movie, the only problem I have is how they got there powers. I hope that in some miracle this movie gets a sequel. Wish the villain was more menacing and wished the ending was different too. So far it's a good movie and would consider watching it."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"I honestly don't get the hate on this movie. It was a perfect execution of narrating the beginning of their story. I believe both the characters and the plot will get more interesting as the movie continues. If you want to talk about trash movies, sonic 1 would be the right discourse."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,Its bland at times but has enough going for it to make it a bit different and quite enjoyable. Its far from amazing but it's not bad either.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"the movie is not a sheet, but is a sheet"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was bad. How can a movie be this bad. Everything was f*uped. Felt like some newbie made this movie to fill-up their portfolio.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"It seems as though too many people are attacking this movie....and I do not know why. Honestly, when I go to a superhero movie, I am not looking for a masterpiece...I am looking to be entertained. This is movie is exactly that; it is entertaining. I thought it was enjoyable to watch. Its simplicity was a pleasure and I though the actors did a fine job. I would enjoy a 2nd one."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"It's a good movie,and i don't mind go watch it again."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,It's worth watching without being influenced by the criticism. The film is entertaining.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie is good, the dinamic of her powers is not something we see everyday. The protagonist is not useless or overpowered, she drives the plot forward. Which is something rare these days.

My only complaints would be the little girls personality."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Not that bad but not good either. A lukewarm addition to the Spider-man mythology. Dakota has a certain charm that, unfortunately, fails to lift up a film with a bad script and a boring villain."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Is it a perfect movie? No, but it's still fun and has a dynamite cast, captivating story and unexpected twists. No more convoluted than Poor Things which was a masterpiece. Because I see these films with my resident Marvel encyclopedia I know it's a relatively canon tale, hints at bigger things for the future and is an alternate timeline in terms of aunts and uncles, good and bad guys, etc. but overall a strong entry with potential for people looking for a more feminine spidyverse."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It didn't seem bad to me. If it's about entertainment, it's a bearable movie. The low budget must be taken into account."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"My wife and I went to see Madame Web in spite of the brutal reviews and we both really enjoyed it. Was never boring (nor slow in a bad way). Compelling story that was at times emotional. Lead character was very likable - she had a sweet disposition though initially she was shown to be somewhat jaded and detached. Supporting characters were interesting. Villain was gross, as a villain should be. When it was over and we left the theater, I had a good feeling inside. I'd seen something good. Something worthwhile."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"idk how to say this nicely, but i want my time and money back. Just saw this right before watching the Bob Marley bio pic and i regret watching this movie."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I think the story has many problems and holes, too much driving around, lack of interesting characters or villain, everything seems artificial and not very deep."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Worst Acting I’ve ever seen, Sloppy Script and Sloppy CGI"
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Not sure why this movie is rated so low. It's not the best marvel movie but it's overall pretty good. My whole family recently watched the marvels and agree that Madame Web is hands down better. It's engaging the entire time and Dakota Johnson did great. The last few minutes could have been done a lot better, but it doesn't discredit the rest of the movie. I was hesitant to see this because of the reviews, I'm glad I did anyway."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Puzzling and displeasing visuals, a cliché script that borders on cringe at times and a disappointing climax sink a potentially compelling character's origin story. While it's not quite as terrible as people make it out to be, this was definitely a poor effort from Sony."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"We found this movie to be very entertaining although it doesn't have the special effects of previous ""Spidey Movies"". The plot is interesting, the pace is excellent, and the acting is solid! If we had fallen asleep during the movie, then the critics would have been right in their terrible reviews..Sorry, we enjoyed it!!"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I can't work out what's going on with Sony.  Morbius was rubbish and the same script writers (plus corporate interference) produced a dog of a film that was lampooned to death.  This is worse and begs the questions:  Is Sony just trying to keep their hold of the IP of  Spiderman alive by the obligatory release of films in the same universe?  If yes, why don't they make an effort?  Are the executives so incompetent that they are unaware of what entertainment is?  Are they convinced that only fanboys will go to these film so that the script has the depth of a comic book?  Are they ignorant of the fact that the Avengers etc made so much money because people who had never read the comics and knew nothing about them went to see those films?  Do Sony execs come from another planet?"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Well, it felt like a long movie, and then again, it didn't. The story was a little flat and didn't go anywhere. The ending didn't explain how the three girls got their powers! Ok, Madame Web is, sorry, that's a spoiler. The implication of our future, sorry, that's another spoiler. No after credit scene to worry about, get up and get out! The best part was watching the movie with my son, then getting some lunch after the movie."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,It was Sad about her mother but more inspirational afterwards when she found out she had a powerful ability and she helped those three sad teenage girls.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This is a movie in which nothing happens, our hero's only heroic ability appears to be running over people with a car, and ends with one of the least satisfying, ho hum endings in comic book movie history. The acting is awful, likely due to the cast being embarrassed of the script, the action non existent, and a plot that has nothing driving it forward. Embarrassing. Sony needs to stop trying to beat this dead horse.  Marvel hasn't been doing much better as of late, but they at least have some gas left in the tank."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,i wish there was a rating below half a star.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,The cast and acting is terrible. Might not be appropriate for many 7 year olds. There were alot of jumpy scenes ( which I liked) but may not be good for the faint heart. Reminds me a little of Final Destination movies. I'm surprised this is a Marvel movie.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Fun film, critics as usual get it wrong."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Story deff felt a bit rushed. Throwing all these characters together all at once was extremely hard to navigate. It picks up nicely in the second act and by the third I was not only invested but interested in what could come of this. Hope to see more.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"At this point you just wonder if Sony will ever get to grips with what it is doing with Marvel, from bad dialogue to flying ambulances, this is definitely not Marvellous"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Not Rotten but still fun
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I really didn't expect anything from this movie, and it manages to give me what I expected, even less; but at this point more than just wishing the film bad, I'm just wondering how SONY gave the green light to a project like this? I am convinced that everyone involved is aware of the quality that the film has, and it seems very strange to me how this universe continues to exist, it has already demonstrated since it began that there is no substance, these films do not even generate economic profit (except for the two Venom movies). I think it is important to rethink what this universe of films wants to be and where it wants to go, because the only thing that Madame Web does achieve is generate unanimous apathy towards a very uncertain future. The movie isn't even one of those that are so bad that they're good or funny, this one is so bad because it's so boring and unsubstantial. It has been a long time since a film generated a case study as dense as Madame Web."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,I watched it 37 times in one day!  One of the Spider-Man movies of all time.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,so good!!! can't wait to see what they do with this
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,sooo boring. i didn´t feel any action or adrenalin. I laughed only after the movie about the movie
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Slow plot. Boring. Merely a movie to introduce lame Marvel characters.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,Horrible story lots of holes in the plots AI generated dialogue some cool scenes but would wait till after the movie is out of the theaters
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"La peor película del año sin lugar a dudas, mejor dicho la peor que he visto en mi vida, me salí del cine a media película, nada de acción, aburrida y poco entretenida. 1/10"
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie offers an interesting perspective as it is set in 2003. The cast is one of a kind and it is always nice to see new stories from the Spiderverse. The movie isn't horrible, it just misses a couple of things we have gotten used to. Worth watching in my opinion."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Ve a verla¡¡¡ mientras escuchas algo de Bad Bunny¡¡¡ extasis puro¡¡¡
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie! Definitely a must see! I hope they make sequels!
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This is the lowest I've ever reviewed a movie on here. The girls were good. Ben was a great. They had an opportunity to tell a good origin story and add some action.  Too much unnecessary origin story with no real payoff or closure.  
And Stop making Spider-Man movies without Spider-Man. What are they thinking about?  Venom 1 is the only one that should have been stand alone. If Sony is going to act like Spider-Man is not one of the top 3 most popular Superheroes ever created, then sell him back to Marvel Studios for live action.  
(At least they knew to put him in Miles Morales movie.)"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,This was a terrible film. Horrible writing and horrible acting
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,the theater seats didn't work. they just told us to move. the whole point of oaying higher prices for the mx4d theater is that the seats are supposed to do things along with the movie. theater should have blocked these seats from purchase until they get them fixed.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Worst ""superhero"" film in current cinema history."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Me divertí viendo una mala película, de forma objetiva, la película tiene muchos fallos de guión, un mal villano y tiene falencias graves como película de superhéroes, como el hecho de mostrar a las chicas solo en visiones a futuro, como el hecho de que no concuerda la historia de peter parker con lo enseñado del tío Ben o la mamá de peter, y el desperdicio que resultó ser la protagonista y sus poderes.
Pero al menos pasé un buen rato viéndola ya que la protagonista cae bien y tiene buenas escenas de acción, no creo que pague un boleto para verla otra vez, pero si aparece en tv, un domingo cualquiera, creo que me quedaría viéndola. Sin expectativas de película del MCU."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Boring, shallow, nothing interesting there. Another Morbius kinda movie."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Fue una pelicula buenisima para compartir con familia y amigos, me encanto la pelicula de Madam Web y como muestran una historioa de origen brutal inspirada en el amor de una madre."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"As a comic and movie fan, I know that you cannot translate them one for one, so when going to watch a movie I do not compare and contrast them.  For me, its them both existing separately that is important.  

Most reviews could not do this and missed that this movie was not a comic.  The story was not bad, there was a lot of action but not the normal we have seen in action or super hero movies of late.  That is okay.

If you take this on its own, it was enjoyable.  My family, who are not big comic fans, all loved it.  So my 3 star was moved up to account for that."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Another terrible marvel movie. It's unwatchable
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,It's an okay movie. People are exaggerating on performances or special effects. Everything is passable and it is a standard saturday afternoon movie. Critics giving it 13% is absurd given even the marvels got 62% and madam web is way more engaging than that.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie was definitely underrated. After seeing low audience scores I almost decided not to watch it, but finally followed my instincts and what a pleasant surprise. It was fun, the plot was balanced, not excessively full of fights and action sequences that are usually forced to justify the genre. The chemistry between Dakota and Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced & Celeste O'Connor was nice and refreshing as it didn't follow the cliche of a romantic interest for the main character. The story was good too, conveying positive messages and portraying an unconventional hero whose main powers were more complex and untraditional. Don't try to compare this movie with others, just enjoy it appreciating its merits standalone without thinking about genre fatigue and other nonsense coming from the mainstream. I fully recommend watching it."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Fun movie, Dakota Johnson was excellent."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Oh my goodness. This has got to be the biggest train wreck of a plot to ever see the light of day...
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,It was just a good movie I love everything about marvel and the spider verse
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,this is a perfect Final Destination meets Marvel movie. if you go in expecting female spiderman then you are expecting a movie that was never promised. super fun movie. better then some of the Phase 4 Marvel movies.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,The sound of chalk screeching is like a chill moment compared to watching that thing.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Great cast with horrible scripts ..no action scenes..poor CGI ..I don't know how this is supposed to be superhero movie 💔
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"I can understand why a lot of people didn't like the film, it's different from a typical Marvel film or superhero film that come out in the last years, but I personally enjoyed the slow burn that come with a comings to be a superhero, something that I think was lost in the marvel genera. I liked the female cast and Dakota interpretation of madame web is stunning, what I don't understand is the prejudices about the film that it's around the web even before people seen it."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,garbage.....................
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Hi, I went yesterday with my nephew (62 and 14) and we really quite enjoyed it. The miserable critics seem to have overlook a few subtle features of Madam Web. One it is presented as a very traditional comic book story, and I could envisage old school Peter Parker (and his angst) in every scene. Even the villains work at a comic book level, with a narrative style that is certainly two dimensional because that how they were written (think of Syndrome from the Incredibles). Plus, the young hero's are completely Scooby Doo, which only adds to retro-styling but in a very clever way. I saw all of this and appreciated it greatly, where as my nephew just thought it was a great movie. My feeling is too many critics are too invested in the super-glossy, over designed 'Marvel Universe' and all its associated baggage and need to take a broader filmatic view..."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Acting was bland. Storyline was boring and the worst villain ever in a ""superhero"" film. The editing was horrible with odd zoom in's and terrible CGI. Watch this movie if you're in for a good laugh at how bad it is."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,This is a bad movie no way around it. Almost unbelievable but with Hollywood nowadays I'm not surprised.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Absolut horrible! Every 5 star review seems to be a bot.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,I have no accurate words to describe this train wreck in a way that truly convey how bad it is
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Maybe it was because I had low expectations but I thought this film was fine.  Yeah there were a few clunky lines and weirdly contrived plot points (and the antagonist's dialogue seemed amateurish) but it was still enjoyable to watch, and the main leads were captivating enough."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"I LOVED the movie, It's refreshing to have a new origins story. Not sure why the critics are hellbent on destroying the movie. My only criticism is that they could have shown off her powers a bit more, but I belive they are gearing up for a sequel"
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,I dont understand why so many people hate on this movie. Me and my mom loved it
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Really bad and really really slow.. very disappointing
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,what did i just watch.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,I'm sorry but can we just stop Making superhero movies for a while. The entire genre is stale and stretched beyond breaking point. There is a reason why these movies continue to fail. Enough!
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"An experience you'd wish you've never seen in your entire life. It's a horrible excuse of a superhero movie. The plot is a mess, the writing is terrible, the editing looks like it's not budgeted enough, the fight scenes are horrendous. It was overall terrible."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"a lot of people got hyped about this movie and honestly worst spiderman related movie ever. looked more like a cw series and a lot of the lines from the antagonist are dubbed over making super weird. most of the movie antagonist choking everyone, and madam webb ran over everything with a vehicle."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Really bad Audio work for Ezikiel, and was a was terrible villain. Bad script and directing"
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,It was a good portrayal of the Madame Wed origin story.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Absolutely terrible. Such a waste of potential ... don't waste your time
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Absolutely atrocious
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Be honest, this movie is out of the box, more epic then all MCU movies even doctor strange!! Combanine balancing between physical and nonphysical world rationally"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Plot was bad dialogue terrible no Spider Man in it
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Slow burn at the start, but if you like spider man the ending is really good; definately worth a watch"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,Movie was great. But not the way I really expected. I understand why was so emptyzzz.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Fuck you Sony. Just fuck you. This movie is like drinking orange juice after brushing your teeth. This is THE. worst comic book film. If you could call it a comic book film, I have ever seen. And I watched morbious 2 times. You have the license to one of the greatest super heros and their villains, and you make movies about villains actually being the good guys. Or, in this case, a character no one gives a rats ass about. You have fumbled not 1, not 2, not 3, but 4 films. It blows my mind how a company can be this idiotic. I a 15 year old high schooler, could write a better film in a week with a stick up my ass. In all, I can't wait for Kraven the Hunter. I'm sure it will meet my none existing expectations."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie. I enjoy watching a female cast kick butt. Being an origin story, the nuances brought depth to the movie. In the end, the good guys won which left us ready for the next chapter."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"No comment. No action, same plays over and over again. No good story. Refund, please!"
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,The story was very captivating but I’d like more actions from all girls including madame web!
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Definitely didn’t meet our expectations for a marvel associated movie.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie was pretty good, confusing at times, by it was fun to see references and cool weird spectacles.Just because its weird, doesn't make it not fun."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Acting was meh. Storyline was not compelling. Along with The Marvels, I see a pattern of an attempt at inclusiveness, but clearly, the writers were on strike for these. If Hollywood wants to be more inclusive, try taking pointers from the MCU's ""Black Widow."""
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Thought it was great.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"It's not as awful as people make it out to be, it's suspenseful and gets you on the edge of your seat. 

Is it someone thing out of this world amazing? No. But it was good, it showed a unique aspect of the ""spider verse"" powers of telling the future and it gave you a hint of suspense. 

I enjoyed it. 7/10"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Pretty lame, fell asleep for a bit. It felt like they tried to be different by having 3 future super heroes that didn't have their  powers yet. Tried to be unique  while setting up future movies.
Formula didn't work, what a yawner."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Went in with low expectations, even then, they were subverted."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Es una película más de historia y bueno el título dice de qué va a tratar…
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed the movie was so fun and I love Dakota such a beautiful and great actress
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Quite disappointing script and acting. Would have loved to see more developed characters. I feel this film was a teaser to future ones to come. They missed the mark on making this a series watchable in the future.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"WARNING- Spoilers ahead

My main reason for giving it the 4 (instead of 4) is the action- I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and in a good way! I was constantly stuck between ""did it happen?"" or ""is this the future?"" And the sound effects were quite intense, but in a good way when judging action scenes. I recall the theater collectively going ""ooohh(!!!)"" as we all kind of flinched thinking what the pain would feel like, based on the sounds (especially during the diner scene). I thought the actual fighting sequences were pretty good too, considering the power/force differences between the characters. It was more like wit vs brute force, which seemed appropriate considering Cassie's adjustment to her powers vs the much stronger villain. I tend to judge fight/action scenes based on whether the portrayal of strengths is reasonable or not. 

Getting into some of the less positive aspects / other comments : 
-Some of the lines were a bit cheesy / random / rushed / could've been stronger. 
-It would've been nice to see more of the girls bonding and becoming their projected future selves. 
-Villain origin story was missing? What was his motivation/end goal with having the spider? He just seemed like a weakly written character.
-Maybe this is just me but I expected the villain's IT support girl to somehow intervene and help the girls out...when she realized their ages, it just seemed like she would play a larger role in the plot.
-Didn't know Emma Roberts was in this, just seemed kind of random lol 
-Why didn't Ben want to reveal who his love interest was? I thought there was going to be something with him + Cassie based on the silence.
-I am not familiar with the comics so I was surprised to see Cassie in her condition at the end of the film. Didn't realize the full extent of that one explosion in the water...

Overall it was pretty entertaining, and the plot of a ""not trying to catch feelings"", socially awkward paramedic becoming a caring, mother figure to 3 teen girls was pretty sweet. I wouldn't let any negative reviews keep you from watching it, there are some pretty cool parts to it. You might like it!"
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Not nearly as bad as people are saying. It was very enjoyable with fun characters. There was good action with a decent villain. Just go watch it and form your own opinion.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie was waaay better than the reviews said it was. The cast was good, and I didn't notice anything that deserved the hate this movie is getting. Not the best Marvel entry, but it was a good pastime and worth seeing. Pretty cool story, and great messages of found  family."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie is actually really good once you make all the connections.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,I thought the movie was enjoyable
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,If it's not a marvel movie but a stand alone title it might be better. They give too much important to marvel's easter egg stuff instead of character development and plot.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"From an intriguing first scene to a satisfying finale, this is a fun ride. 

Dakota Johnson is humorously sarcastic in the title role, with the rest of the cast fulfilling the job of ""giving audiences a good time"".

The dialogue is fun, and to the point. The fact that the movie doesn't entertain in the same manner that other Marvel flicks do is a good thing. This has its own 'personality' and is a bit more cerebral, rather than just one battle after another.

A scene in a diner is played humorously, yet tense, and reminds one of the goofy entertaining movies from the 80's.

This is a good, fun, quickly paced flick.
I'd like to see more of ""Madame Web""."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,Surprised with all the negative reviews. I thought it was pretty entertaining and better than the Marvels which I recently watched on Disney Plus.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,this movie has everything. spiders. car crash. hassan piker. if you're looking to crawl into a fantasy world this might be the film for you and your loving wife. consider watching this if you think you might like it. 5 stars
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"We liked - not loved - this movie.  8 out of 10.
I don't understand all the bad reviews.
I kept wondering when the movie was going to get ""bad"".
An enjoyable movie.  I think it will be very successful on DVD and streaming."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"It's a good movie, I don't understand why experts rated so bad"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie was not it. I was excited but ended up being disappointed. Marvel needs to step
up their game & do better. Wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone save your money."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,There's more suits and action in the trailer than in the hole movie. My sister and I agree is the worst movie of marvel. Was just happy with the ending song dreams by The Cranberries
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's an entertaining film. There isn't much new to see here and there are some wasted opportunities to tie to Mark and Ben Parker.

It's a wortwhile film and not the hot garbage some think...but its definitely not a pinacle piece like Tom Holland led Spiderman films or most of the MCU at large."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Awful writing. Awful cinematography. Awful performances. Extremely awful ADR. This ""movie"" is truly bad."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"I would say as a non fan of marvel movies but a fan of geeky things in general this might have been the most entertaining movie, be prepared to make fun of it as you go and don't take it too seriously"
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Enjoyed the movie. Some parts could’ve been better but didn’t think it was as bad as people thought. Give it a 3.75. Wish it did better because I feel the second movie would’ve been a lot better.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"In the beginning the camera moves so much you almost get whiplash. There is no hero training scene, which is important for any hero character coming into their powers."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Was a great movie can't wait for the second movie
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Terrible. Marvel should be embarrassed. Awful plot with worse script writing 
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,Review: https://wp.me/p65txm-fby/#MadameWeb
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Was wary of the movie going in as the all the reviews online were super negative, but I was was very pleasantly surprised with it. The begging of the movie establishes the characters just enough to the point where we care for them and it doesn't use up too much of the run time. The special effects, cinematography, and acting by Dakota Johnson perfectly exemplify the suspense of the movie and the magic behind it. Super fun watch. Definitely recommend."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Fun and thrilling. I love girl power movies and that was a cool uplifting and unique movie. Madame Web has awesome superpowers.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"O vilão do filme passou o filme todo sendo atropelado, além de ter voado longe porque um fogos bateu nele. Só bateu na protagonista uma vez no filme todo e foi só um soco na barriga."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Eu esperava mais da personagem, história de origem fraca que não demonstrou totalmente os poderes dela, faltou um pouquinho de demonstração de habilidades-aranha, as outras aranha acho que elas poderiam ter desenvolvido suas habilidades nesse filme. Vilão meio fraco também, filme foi recheado de referencias, porém se tivesse citado o Peter Parker pelo menos ficaria uma nota maior."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"We really enjoyed this movie! This is a great addition to the marvel franchise. We are hoping to see more of this story line in the future! 
We found it to have a spiritual content, good acting and special effects! 
It was a high 5 star performance!"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,Very much exceeded expectations. The story was engaging and coherent. The acting was serviceable. Was refreshing that some of the action was not CGI. If you are Marvel fan you will not be disappointed. 
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Don't know what people all talking about movie is amazing!how it got bad reviews can't understand. Hopefully they'll make another one.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Contrary to stupid credits...  this is Actually a good movie. Made good use of the time and plot was explained fluidly and precisely.  Acting was good and no over the top acting like other Spider-Man movies.  Wife and I both liked it.

The end fight could improve with more ""what if scenarios"" but it's not bad at all."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,This might be the worse movie I've ever watched in my lifetime. How can one have an amazing cast like that & create such a travesty?  I walked in with no expectations but the girls were looking like Halloween city when I saw them suited up TWICE for a SECOND.. so poorly written
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This movie is definitely up there for me in terms of  Marvel films because I genuinely liked the story and the characters. I feel like the directors tried to do more with the time they were given, and they should have just focused more on Cassandra's mother and her relation to Ezekiel as opposed to Cassandra protecting the three girls from Ezekiel, and trying to squeeze extra tidbits in. If you're going to begin telling the story of a character, it should just be about that character. I do like the three girl's characters, but I think the directors could have set this up much better for a sequel if the girls were more of a side thing than the whole movie. I really liked it though! The action shots were insanely cool and got my heart racing."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Lazy writing. I feel that there is potential with a better director... but the story and acting was just lazy.
Great idea, bad execution."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"I mean, is not the best movie of the decade, but is not as bad as everybody say. is an origins movie, you won't see a lot of powers display, but it does the job, I enjoyed, I was hesitant to pay for it, but it was a good one, that doesn't mean that they used false advertisement, but we'll survive 😉"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Ummm. Good movie. The ending???? What was that, trash is what it was. It wasn't even that bad in beginning, the cgi… yeah umm the middle was good but that ending was straight garbage. It's literally like they just gave up, gave her sunglasses and sat that heifer in a wheelchair and called it an ending. I love dakota but she should've stuck to romance or whatever else she's in cuz she just looked awkward while trying to be a superhero. There was a point where she was standing there and she just looked goofy. She's so good tho i love her. But yeah. It was just the ending that made me want to die."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,Not as awesome as many other Marvel movies. Would have preferred to have watched it for free on Disney
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"What can I say? It was alright. I was going to give it a 75 till the last three minutes.  It was soooo cringey! I guess part of the problem was not getting the full action they promised. But it was just an introduction. Also, you really need to be into Dakota Johnson’s type of awkwardness."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,interesting  tie in to spider man. ok.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I think giving this movie one star is being generous. Between the plot that made no sense, the dialogue that sounds like a child wrote it, the lines that Rahim said that sounded dubbed over, and the zooming in and out randomly at times made it feel like it was shot with a camcorder. This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in the theatre. Don't waste your money or time on this stinker."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Very good. Fun movie. Enjoyed it very much. Obviously its not Godfather 2 or Gone with the wind. but for what it is I liked it and my kids did too.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"It's the origin story of Madame Web. It's different from most superhero movies, but it's still good."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Was impressed with the movie and the plot. I'm not sure why reviews are so poor. Good cast and storyline.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,... I think this is the worst movie i ever Saw ...
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I've heard all the negativity, I've seen movies that were a lot worse . This wasn't terrible , I actually enjoyed it"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Entertaining, Definitely not a bad movie.  The story line wasn't as bad as people say. Maybe the whole Amazon trip was a little too much but other than that solid."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Honestly, ignore the low ratings and go see for yourself! I think people are caring the prejudice over the past few mcu movies who have been a bit of the same formula and also sequels... there is always some loss with a sequel, we all know that. But this is an origin movie and it was actually pretty good. I would say a 7.5/10 freon a different metric... I didn't know now much about madame web, so I'm only talking from the mcu perspective and I was missing a movie like that. I really hope the low ratings doesn't mean the end for madame web. I like where it seems to be heading... For those comparing with morbius... it is nothing like that... I promise."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I was expecting much worse.  However,  this is a step up from ""Morbius"" despite the horrible miscasting of Dakota Johnson in the lead role.  She elicits very little interest in her character.  The story,  although convoluted,  is somewhat fun.   However,  I found my thoughts crossing universes between Marvel and DC.  Not being familiar with the comic this is based on didn't help... it struck me as the basis for the ""Birds of Prey"" television show."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Complete garbage.  I'm so embarrassed for the MCU.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,I enjoyed myself. Sony has a lot of room to grow in expanding their universe. Superhero film.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Definitely not as bad as others are saying. Much better than most recent Marvel movies. It has more of a slow-burn thriller vibe, which my family enjoyed. For the first time in a while, I actually cared about the heroes and wanted the villian to get his. My family enjoyed it but if you want to see a bunch of ripped dudes blow stuff up, this isn't your thing."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,wokness is killing everything.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"This was really good, well-plotted, good acting, nice action & effects, plus a ton of Easter eggs! Can't wait to see it again."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I do like Marvel universe movies, but this one is probably the worst one I've seen 😔"
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the movie very much. Super fun. Not an intellectually challenging story line. But worth your time. 
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great pace, great character development and great dialog minus a few moments. The characters weren't all powerful immediately (like they tend to be in other marvel movies with female protagonists), making it easier to root for the characters as you see them struggle before winning in the end."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this movie. My teenage girls I took with me loved it so much and were practically bouncing when we left bc of the baby and next movie set up. I dont understand all the hate. There have been SO many Marvel movies that were way worse. And Dont even get me started on DC. This is the first origin/prequel comic book movie Ive thought was entertaining. Looking at you, Logan. Movie critics are way too jaded these days. This movie was fun and interesting. Stop being grumpy."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Unfortunately, the new Marvel Madame Web movie fell short of expectations. Despite its potential for an enthralling story and captivating characters, the film struggled to engage viewers and lacked the compelling narrative that fans have come to expect from Marvel. The pacing felt uneven, and the plot failed to deliver the depth and excitement often associated with superhero movies. While the visual effects were impressive, they were not enough to salvage a lackluster storyline. Overall, the movie failed to leave a lasting impression and may disappoint die-hard Marvel enthusiasts."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Dakota Johnson's performance will be studied for years to come.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"I do not get the hate--there was some clunky dialogue at the start, but after that it settled into a nice little origin story.  It was set in the early noughts, but almost felt like a 90's superhero film, in all the good ways.  Dakota Johnson goes through the whole hero's journey while looking after some teens with attitude (told you it felt 90's :D), and I hope we see more of our spider heroines sometime in the future!"
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the haters the movie is amazing
Would recommend watching .will definitely be re watching this movie"
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie that takes the time to build the story. Looks like Ma4vel is getting back to its roots. introduce the character and do a Great job with their Origin Story. my teen girls Loved it and we can't wait for the next one!
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Time skips was bad in the movie.
 introduction  of the movie was good"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Unfortunately, Sony's 'Madam Web' is set to be considered one of the weakest superhero films ever made, a bold statement, but one that reflects its reality. Despite boasting a talented cast, their potential is undercut by a combination of lackluster editing and either poorly portrayed characters or performances that seem disengaged, as if the cast was aware from the start that the project was doomed to fail. The core issue lies in its uninteresting story, which fails to captivate or engage, making 'Madam Web' a disappointing addition to the superhero genre."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's nice. Good to see the girls, but some feeling was missing."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Not perfect but aside from a few odd details like the yellow taxi, a good movie.  I can't see how it was much worse than No Way Home which was a bit silly in spite of some great moments. Madame Web has an odd ending, not great, but I get it as a set up for the new characters.  Who are very interesting, so I might compare it to so-so origin films for Wolverine.  Were they as good as X1 or X2? No but I would say only two Marvel movies were as good as X1 and X2.  So anyway, Madame Web is great maybe for it's target audience like my daughter She gave it 4 stars or 4.5 because it was too ""kid-showy"" at the end. She is 12. So if more critics or kids were writing reviews the score might go up. It was a lot like a cheesy comic book and so people just don't get it. Sony did a good job all things considered with their odd contract."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,It's not that bad. I don't understand all the extremely bad reviews.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I couldn't even make it to the end of the movie before deciding my half star rating. Poor writing, poor characters, poor execution. Morbius level bad, a waste of a star-studded cast."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Dear god. I had hope but that was ruined in the first ten minutes
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,I don't understand why they would make a superhero movie with no superhero costumes for 95% of the movie. And the spider-man connection was extremely weak. Like we all knew that the baby's name was going to be Peter. (eyeroll)
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed it. Dakota is fun and witty. The villain is creepy. Four lead females!! Awesome. The origin is interesting. The plot isn't overshadowed by the origin story. The sfx are solid. And there are a couple overt connections to the MCU spider verse. 

All in all, this flick is getting a lot more hate than I expected. And as I read the review, a lot of them are coming from folks who don't plan to see the movie, so they don't really get an opinion, yeah?"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Lack of story, and a total treason to spider-man, without anything new"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,The movie was slow and boring … nothing made since … played off Spider-Man and to top it off she could just see the future … long and drawn out … I had to get a refill of popcorn because I was so bored … save your money it will be free on a streaming service soon
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Terrible movie with no pretense.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,Entertaining popcorn movie.  Overly roasted by critics.
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Everything from the action, storyline, the characters' build up, the explanations to what's going on as far as the ""powers"" or ""abilities"", was not there and underwhelming. The attitudes, logic, and seriousness of their situation was not even taken seriously (which makes it even less captivating). The ""teenagers"" (in my opinion) looked older which didn't fit the roles. There's more but I wasn't a big fan of the film."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is truly one of the movies ever made. I was sobbing when madame web said it's webbing time and webbed all over the place. I have heard that this film reemployed the writers from the cult classic Morbius. This was an excellent decision, as the writing is extremely written. This film changed my life, and, if I dare to say it, may in fact be even greater than Morbius"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,It’s not as bad as people are making it out to be. Went in with low expectations and that might have helped.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Genuinely loved this movie. The plot and story were super interesting and shows the clairvoyance power in such an exciting interesting way instead of playing scenes redundantly. The cast was great with Dakota and Sydney.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,A nice take  on spider wimen saga. Possibllity of sidestories are endless with multiple characters!!! Good movie!!!
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Action packed kept us on the edge of our seats.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,o filme é maravilhoso foi um dos melhores filmes que eu já vi e recomendo pra todos
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,This was more of a close to two hour Pepsi commercial than anything. There must have been someone on staff to make sure every Pepsi can faced the camera. Not sure I would count their speaking as dialog neither. Seemed to be no compatibility with any of the actors. Poorly put together.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Not as bad an everyone says. If you know what you're getting into you'll have a fun time. I recommend you rent it or wait for streaming.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Another Sony Marvel movie where they use a Spider-Man side character. In a solo movie no one asked for. Of course when they almost made an Aunt May movie.
     It's like Sony only made the movie because Tom Holland wanted Madame Web in a Spider-Man movie.
    Which definitely would have been better. Especially if she showed up in the No Way Home end credits scene. Where he felt the most alone. 
     Madame Web did keep my attention but mostly felt like a superhero version of Final Destination."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,I loved this movie! So much fun! Go see it!
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,My favorite part was leaving the theatre and pranced to my car
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This film in useless. First of all the plot is confusing, because the entire story turn around the villain that must kill three girls but in this film that has a link with comics and superpowers, there aren't superpowers. Is a thriller movie that has not a structure, is all superficial. Sony must stop to make movies that are not linked with Spiderman. I am without any words.... The best aspect of this film is the chemistry between the 4 main characters; stop this is the only aspect that I save about this film. I would talk about the other good characteristics of this film, but unfortunately there aren't. Sorry!!..."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Not as bad as the critic's said. It was way better than the marvels for sure!!  I just don't understand why they even made this movie, from what I read, they were never going to make a sequel or follow up with anyone offs etc. Disney and Marvel really needs to step it up!!"
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,We really enjoyed the movie in spite of what naysayers said.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Not great but a good time.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"If I was to rate this movie between a 1 and 10 I'd give it a negative 2.
It lacked so much action and just came off as the kind of movie to make you fall asleep in the middle of it. This movie definitely would never live up to the other marvel films that have came out. Just my personal opinion."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Terrible Movie.Terrible acting.Terrible writers.Smh
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"When you take on the responsibility, great power will come. 

All 15 of us in the theater applauded as this movie came to its conclusion. It was a great responsibility, now we have great power."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"POor acting by the leads.. esp. Dakota.. not a spec of emotion on their faces, is that how you run for life?? 30mins on, and I just lose my mind.. I'm burning my bridges with Dakota.. it's over gurl"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,someone said that the mcu should've called 911… sure but i hope dakota changes time. the movie is quite fun but what happened at the end? hah? and the actresses are hot:)))
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was ridiculous at times, but I was entertained the whole time and I love Dakota Johnson!"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Is it Deadpool? Is it Guardians? Is it Avengers? Is it any of the Tom Holland SpiderMan films? Nope. Not even close. But in a world where we have been spoiled by some spectacular blockbusters this film is an entertaining way to spend two hours and get lost in a movie world. At a time when everything else is caught up in overly complicated multiverse plots, Madame Webb actually stays contained within its own story and keeps the thread moving throughout. There are some plot gaps and unexplained moments that leave you scratch your head.. My biggest regret - wishing that Adam Scott had more screen time in the best played role of the film."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"I thought this was a great movie.  I don’t know why the professional critics panned this one!  It had a message.  It was interesting, with a powerful villain.  Even the women’s lib (if that will stop you) was nowhere near as strong as in movies from a couple of years ago."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Would highly suggest watching this movie. Fresh characters who messed together well and felt authentic. Forbidding villain that while generic felt well connected. Definitely worth a trip to the movies.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,I would say even though the ssu (Sonys spider man universe) had negative reviews. This movie was better than morbius and venom two. I never seen a movie with Dakota Johnson but this is the first movie that she did a good job in good luck Sony for Any of your future films and to Sidney Sweeney
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,quiet a nice watch considering all the negative reviews
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie! Much fun to watch.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The film isn't as bad as some critics might say, but it was definitely presented with issues regarding the script, I think as some point they had a good script, but everything was changed and it turned into...that. Way too many teases to MCU events or spiderman related things, we don't need a film with so many teases to spiderman, just make your own story."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"What a waste of time. I so wanted this to be good but, geez it was cringy to watch. The ""action"" scenes were laughably bad."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This is the worst Hollywood film i have seen in the past 2 years - truly uninspired, lacking chemistry amongst the actors, confusing storytelling and bad cgi…it is better left to be seen while you are doing house chores that may help you keep awake…"
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great movie, very entertaining. It tied in well with the Marvel movies. Nice having leading characters as females "
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Worst Superhero Movie of All Time. Not a Single Fight Scene and cringe Dialoges,bad Acting."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Twas the shittiest of shitstorms I have ever paid $26 to see. DO NOT SEE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"How is this what marvel has become? One of the worst things I've ever watched. It was rushed, unsure of what it was trying to be and just so boring. No even Adam Scott could save thus disaster. Don't waste your time."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,I was entertained by the ensemble of actresses and their unique superhero story.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"4 superheroes and the villain dies with a ""P"""
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I'm so glad this movie exist. In a world where ""Peter Parker"" has been revamped & rebranded so many times. I enjoyed the secrecy of everything but saying his name. This film aims high & takes a chance. Madame Web dares to dig into a story outside the Spider-Man world.

The film dates back to 2003 New York City & maybe up until halfway through, I realized that a phone wasn't even an option to handle a crisis. I'm not sure if it's this movie specifically but, it gives the impression that 2003 isn't/wasn't that long ago. (Or maybe I'm old) Ironically, the villain shows us that we have come more dependent on technology usage for the character of Spider-Man.

I do wish they fully committed to being practical instead of teasing some of the suit looks & powers that's a lil frustrating when you look at the CGI. The actors are strong enough to carry the dialogue if you give them something worth while. It's not perfect but to me could easily be one of my favorite non Peter Parker Spider-Man movies. The possibilities of a sequel I'm unsure but I could happily watch this as a prequel for the Toby McGuire films. (despite no correlation)

I don't think I'll ever understand the hate on its initial release. It's a cool movie that doesn't try so hard to be anything but itself."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,The movie made no sense!
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,I was not impressed with a movie that does not spider man in the movie and the story didn't convince me at all. It is not a movie for me. Maybe for someone else.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,I try not to take the reviews of movies too seriously before I watched this I heard mixed reviews and some people saying this was going to be the lowest ranking Marvel film those same people are the ones that said the Flash movie was bad I enjoyed the Flash movie this one wasn’t bad either I personally liked it
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,The actor who plays the “evil Spider-Man” in the movie is the only downside. It’s as if Sony filmed the movie with a whole other actor and then dubbed in this new guy and his lips don’t match the voice 
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"few cheesy moments and plot holes, but overall enjoyable if you like the Spiderman story.   lots of good action."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Simply Awful just awful.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,Although there's a lot of problems but it's a lot of fun
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movies was amazing! I went with my friend and we both greatly enjoyed this movie. (No spoilers) This movie was gripping and held my attention for the whole 2 hours! (I have a short attention span, so, for me, this is pretty impressive!) There was a perfect storyline- everything worked perfectly! I would not recommend this movie for children under the age of 10 as it might scare them, but otherwise, I recommend this movie for everyone!"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,This was really appalling; the dialogue was incredibly bad. AI would improve it.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"it's not as bad as the reviewers and critics wants you to believe...it's not great, but it's entertaining, it doesn't feel long, it's worth a watch."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Hey you left your mail down the stairs.....👨‍🦼
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,It was okay.  Perhaps the next one will be better
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"I loved it and stayed hooked throughout the movie. I don't know the source material so can't talk to how closely it matched the comics, but for me it didn't matter. It was a gripping story and I can't wait for any sequels they have planned."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie was one of the worst films I've ever seen. The writing for this movie was awful. The delivery of the lines was terrible as well. I was excited to see this movie and was disappointed after watching it.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Super slow storyline and character development.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Do not watch this Trash! 🗑️ It's like a low budget TV show with bad acting  just watch the trailer and move on with your life
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"All the four Sony Spider-Man spin-offs, this was the best by far. The four ladies carried the storyline. I love how Ben and Mary Parker are featured in the movie.
I love the 2000s vibe.
The main thing I didn't like about the movie is the villain. I found Ezekiel annoying AF."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie was so bad that it wasn't even hilariously bad or campy bad. It was not only distressingly stupid and poorly written, it was also almost offensive in how it's marketed. The characters never actually become superheroes. The whole premise is really that Sony needs to make a throwaway movie every 5 years to keep the rights to Spiderman. However, I don't think even they knew how much money they'd lose on this pile of garbage. I wouldn't suggest anyone even watch it on tv."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie was so bad that I made a rotten tomatoes account just so I could give it this rating.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I've never left a review for a movie in my 30 years here on earth. If you value your time and sanity and everything you stand for as a normal person, do not watch this movie. My girlfriend drug me to see this today and this isn't your typical bad movie. It's a one of kind, impressive I might add, atrocity of a movie? It's worse than a movie. It's an eye sore and I physically cringed through most of the movie.

The writing for the villain is incredibly dull and weak & the plot successfully accomplishes zero things. The entire plot is a set up for a sequel(s) that I doubt will ever come & the whole plot could be summarized in a 2-3 min flashback which would be far more entertaining than anything this movie could imagine.

I'm begging you, save your time and money. I wish I could give less than half a star review, but that'll have to do for now."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"It is a great origin story with cool tie-ins to the larger Spider-Man universe. Beyond that, it's a good movie delving into the dangers of obsession and of creating your own destruction."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,The idea of the story was interesting but the execution and direction was done poorly. Some action sequences were cool and some weren't as much.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web is the worst superhero movie I've ever watched in my life and look at the Fantastic Four, The Flash and Thor Love and Thunder, I hate it but this surpasses them all"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Yikes. Just so horrible. Half the dialog is from behind because they dubbed over half the movie. The other half makes you feel like you are watching a foreign film dubbed over in English. There was almost nothing good. Just so bad
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Movie was pretty good. Love the villian suit. Is the movie perfect ..no its not but, its not garbage as they say. Go see it with an open mind !"
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"—Depth & Self-Empowerment—

If you are a wanderer of the rabbit holes of life--an explorer of the psyche & the language of the universe, this is by far one of the best films out there. 

On tier with Inception, Interstellar, the matrix, cloud atlas, but in superhero format.

I can see why this movie can be upsetting to some, as it is very different from most marvel films. And I think that's PRECISELY what makes it INCREDIBLE.

An absolute thrill, thought provoking, mind-bending, powerful experience."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,great story and lots of action.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie has terrible writing and the antagonist is the driest with the worst motivation ever. Dakota Johnson is the only reason to go see this movie. Everything else is trash.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Much better than how the critics described it.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Dakota is 🔥. A lot better than other Marvel movies and it wasn’t over the top fake.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,one of the funniest movies out. laughed almost the entire time. movie of the year pls!!!
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Madam Web was so good I for sure think a second one is going to come out by that ending bro. Cassie is such a badass and her story is so great, action scenes are on point...I do wish there were more fighting scenes and more scenes of the girls in the suits."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I think I need to apologise to Morbius. In all seriousness, this film is total garbage, with a weak script and underwhelming characters. The villain shows no real menace to the plot and this proves as to why Superhero flicks aren't what they used to be, even as recently as 2019.
It's also probably been done to set up Spiderman 4, which even now I'm debating to go watch"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"While this may not be a fantastic movie, I felt it was more enjoyable than the reviews give it. Just relax and don't think too hard about it. I think this may become a cult film one day. Like Empire Records!  lol..."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was  Really Good Movie,introducing new younger superwomen to Marvel Universe!!!!"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Complete shiet.  Unwatchable.  More junk from studio hacks.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This Sony movie is not that bad as people are saying ! They are just haters who think that each superhero movie need to be as good as Avengers Endgame...

When I saw on the internet that this movie was even less good that Morbius, I was not expecting anything. In fact, I was suprised because Ive prefered Madame Web than Morbius even if some are saying the opposite.

It is true that this is not the best superhero movies because you don't have the thrills and the excitement of movie like Endgame or Spiderman Homecoming by example.

I passed a good time and me and my friends even laugh hard at some acts. The actresses were good in general and they have done their best.

For me, it was more a psycology thriller than a common superhero movie, but it was not that bad. The humor was more for young people than older, but by sometimes, it was funny.

At the end, I was down to see what comes next with those characters."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web is if Final Destination was an outdated & poorly executed comic book movie. Filled with numerous plot conveniences, dialogue so painful it's noticeably dubbed over & action that is lazy, it's a shock this movie was given the okay to be made."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Lackluster characters, with even worse pacing. How do I get my money back?"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,No llega a productora para pagar por verla.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Simplesmente ruim, como que isso passou para as telonas?"
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the movie, went in with no real expectations and I liked it I could see myself watching it more than a few times. It did have a few bad CGI moments and one plot point I didn't get but I am here for the ride."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Another lackluster Sony(Marvel associated) Superhero film. The film at it roots had an inspiring new story to tell, but it fell far from that. The cinematography at times became an eye sore and the CGI reminded me of a early 2000s film. The story-telling and performances left a lot to be desired. I can only hope that future Superhero films steer clear of the blueprint this film followed."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Enjoyable - definitely not as bad as the people are saying. In my opinion it's just negative mob mentality.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Not as bad as people are making out. It's mediocre but not the worst and better than Morbius in my opinion.
Love Dakota Johnson in this film, she had such good comedic presence and feel she should be in more comedy's!"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,I fell asleep during the movie
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I wasn't expecting much, but it became worst than expected. What a waste of time."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Madame Web is certainly not the greatest movie I've seen, but it's not the worst either. There are elements of this vision that show the potential for a good future but needs a lot of work to make up for this rushed installment. With a talented cast, music and some fun writing can be the building blocks but they can't erase what felt like lots of production limitations, rewrites, and editing that greatly shows in the film. A couple of boring battles, annoying gimmicks, and underdeveloped characters despite a strong cast were just some of the limitations this movie has to work through if it wants to continue in future installments."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Although I was really excited for this movie I was fairly dissatisfied with the lack of production I would give it three stars but the movie seemed rushed 
A desperate attempt to make something good but backfired on them 
I hope Sonys Spider-Man universe can redeem themselves with Kraven the Hunter 
But not getting my hopes up"
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was enjoyable to watch. If you are looking for something on the level of the AVENGERS, connected to Tom Holland or Tom Hardy then you will be disappointed.  But if you are okay with a good story and a decent plot then you will find this entertaining.  It was good for what it was 👍🏿"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Utter garbage. Among the worst films I've ever seen in a cinema. Inept in every way, from concept to finished product. Saying that, I had an absolute ball watching this in the cinema and laughed the whole way through it. But aye, absolute trash."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Dakota Johnson is an awful actress. Just cause your fam is talented doesn't mean one should get roles over other more deserving talents.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Kids love it. Is a good movie
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,The movie has some good action scenes however I felt the story line was at times confusing and left gaps with the characters along the way. There were some scenes that made absolutely no sense and almost seemed as if the writer had hit a blank and just did a few fillers.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie makes Morbius look like Lord of The Rings. Whose high school film project was this?
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,To whoever established the thought of making this movie....you should honestly think about killing yourself
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"I saw this movie because of the bad reviews. I wanted to see how bad it was for myself. Surprise, I had a blast. It was a fun movie. By far not as bad as people are claiming. I've seen much, much worse superhero movies, trust me. This one, like I said, kept my attention and kept me entertained. There were some weird plot holes and the villain was the weakest link, but overall, this was a fun movie. Ignore the haters. Go see it and judge for yourself. You might enjoy it."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie is hilarious. Love what they did with the adr 😂
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The original darker and mature story for the movie should have been made. Johnson's character had to protect a pregnant Mary Parker from a villain that wanted to kill her to prevent Peter Parker (Spider-Man) from being born. Why it was changed to the utter nonsense we were given is not fair to stars like Johnson, and Sweeney. 

Bad writing, bad direction and editing. Shame on everyone."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was a little cringe at the end but I think it's getting a lot of hate because the trailer was misleading. 

I was hoping to see how they all get their powers."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,All these low scores are from hard core marvel fans. The movie delivered and did great. It's not your typical super hero movie that's for sure but we needed a change from all those derivative Disney marvel films.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Villain was bad, but at least it was better than Mobius and somewhat entertaining.  You really need to suspend your logical thinking to be able to sit through certain parts of the movie, but other than that the action was not bad and liked some of the Spiderman references they made in a movie where they try really hard not to mention Spiderman."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web is a very strong contender for the worst superhero film ever produced by a major studio. It almost feels like a parody of a superhero film. Both the main protagonist and the antagonist give some of the dullest performances I have seen. Much of the dialogue feels clunky and forced if not obviously dubbed over. The action in this film is non-existent as the sequences are pretty much just running away from the villain and avoiding being killed by him. The characters are not likable or believable and the costumes and outfits for the heroes and villains all look like you would find them in a fan made trailer or student film. The film had a couple of glimpses of something competent but ends up feeling completely disjointed. The only time we ever even see the heroes fighting the villain are in these vision/dream sequences where everything is hazy and the actors look silly in their costumes. Unfortunately, we never arrive at this moment in the film and none of the characters who are teased to become these heroes develop powers nor is it even alluded to how they do. I am not sure how or why Sony continues to release these films when they are this terrible, but they should discontinue their Spider-man universe and start over or give the rights to someone else."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I generously award this cinematic masterpiece a stellar two-star rating. It brilliantly delivered on my expectations of a movie where good people effortlessly triumph without any surprising twists or roller-coaster excitement. The bad guy's motivation remained a mysterious enigma, as he showcased superpowers with an unparalleled level of incompetence – a true beacon of weakness. The girls, apparently masters of subtlety, skillfully attracted attention from unknown teens and gracefully danced on tables while trying to lay low. Is it a gripping reality or just a figment of Madam Web's imagination? The movie's ability to let my brain take a well-deserved nap at home truly makes it a popcorn-worthy gem for the ages."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie was outstanding. Need to see more movies like this one . I give it a 5 star
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Really slow first half, drawn out. Story line was boring and all set up for a sequel which i would rather have a double root canal then watch this again or any thing related"
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"The strong female lead cast did not disappoint! Great writing, some hilarious one liners throughout the film that will have you laughing out loud! It's a feel good movie with a perfect set up for a sequel, which I'm hoping we get!"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I....I don't have words to describe what I watched.
First of all I had absolutely low expectations to start with after seeing the trailer but yet this movie still manages to disgust me. No movie in the comic book adaptation or superhero genre as a whole I have seen is this bad. 
I agree sony already did messed up hiring morbius crew for this film but swooney and Johnson are culprits too as during this movie I sometimes felt that they were unable to act example-: whenever there was a flashback or a vision to future Dakota Johnson couldn't keep up with whats happening.
Cinematography disappointed me because from the person that has worked on Spider-Man No way home I only expected that even if everything is bad in this movie cinematography will be better.
Probably the only thing making sense is sony trolling us.
Thanks sony for this absolute mastercrap of a movie. Truly a one that I will never forget and will haunt me in my sleep. 
Perhaps morbius, I was too harsh on you."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,I don't get why is there so much hate on this movie it is a very entertaining and very interesting movie.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Awful. I’d like my money back 
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"From the beginning, from the very first trailer, I knew it was going to be nothing, the movie was terrible, Sony, don't ever make a mistake like this again, please. But now there were also good things, it just hasn't been repaired"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie is an embarrassment to Sony and To Spider-man. This is the worst movie I've seen in since Fantastic 4 2015.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"So bad!!! Can I have my money and time back? And if possible toi, forget that i ever saw that horrible movie 🤮"
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Wasn't a perfect movie, but a start of a good sequel is inevitable. This movie only scratched the surface on what's to come.  You have to have a beginning of a story before you get to the meat and potatoes of the full idea. Give it time."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The story was bad, the action was bad, the ADR was bad, the dialogue was bad.  The acting was passable, but everything that was done in post ruined any hope that this movie could get 3/5 stars.  I felt no connection to any of the characters and felt no desire to see the villain fail.  It feels like this was a first draft written by ChatGPT and edited by a high school video productions class."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The young talent was the only redeemable thing about this movie. Has to be the worst Marvel movie yet. Slow, disjointed, main villain is the worst.  So many cliche lines. It felt like a B movie. The repeated flash forwards/visions were overplayed. I paid extra to see in IMAX. A total waste of time and painful to watch."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"the film is practically an hour and fifty-four minutes of pure nothingness, the antithesis of a super-hero film. A real example of how not to make a comic book film. I really want to understand what was going through S. J. Clarkson's screwed-up head that all this nonsense was a good idea. Super hero movies mainly need two things, people in costumes and great fight scenes, this movie has none of that, I wonder where they used this 80 million budget, I really don't believe in horrendous CGI special effects and poorly made, constant camera cuts and shots that look like they were taken during an earthquake. The only thing it has in common with the comic is the name. Not to mention the co-protagonist actresses who remember absolutely nothing of their comic book counterparts (if not one), and for those few costume scenes not even those, the villain is mediocre if not bordering on ridiculous, they took a character from case of the comics (originally good) and they made him evil with a weak motivation. Morbius in comparison (as much as I liked it) although the latter is also full of problems placed next to Madame Web makes it of the caliber of cult films like Citizen Kane. in conclusion this film is a bad fanfiction without rhyme or reason of a minor comic book character. so much potential wasted, shredded, eaten, spat out if not vomited and thrown into the incinerator."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Please..... just stop.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Watch it for the plot(Ms.Johnson)
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie starts slow and has a few cheesy issues but overall this is a great movie.  There is a lot of action,  good story,  typical marvel movie."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Madame Web was bad, but it's not nearly as bad as people are making it out to be. It wouldn't surprise me if half the people in the reviews haven't actually watched it."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,If I could give it zero stars I would. This movie had no redeeming qualities. I didnt think Dakota Johnson could be any worse at acting and this movie proved me wrong. The story made no sense.  The villain made no sense. Awful awful awful. Sony needs to admit defeat and surrender all the rights it has to any part of Marvel to the official MCU.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,I don't understand why Sony cares so little; but wants me to care about their bad movies? This is a disaster and laughable at best.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Maybe not quite as much action as your regular Marvel movie, but my wife and I thought it was great."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The film is set in 2003 and it is shot like it is a TV pilot from that time too. Everything in it is so half-baked that it is really unbelievable that this is such a huge studio film. At the same time, for this exact reason, and maybe because even bad superhero movies are still comfort films for me, there was some charm to it. The simplicity with which a lot of it is approached, and the lack of real stakes really made this a very comfortable watch. It is still a bad film but I really didn't think it was one of the worst superhero movies. The last superhero movie I saw at the theater, Aquaman 2 was definitely worse than this in my opinion.
And I think the casting was done a long time ago because watching Syndey Sweeny as a meek-mannered teenager supporting character feels very weird when she's basically established as the new hot star in Hollywood."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst films I've seen in my life.  Misleading trailer making us think we would have heroines in the films and they only appear for 30 seconds.  Ridiculous villain, a poorly made copy of Spider-Man just to say there is a Spider-Man.  Shame on others film"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,A sporadic slow burn mess that has lots of empty moments and feels rushed.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Sony needs to stop.  This movie was absolutely unbearable to watch.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Was it the worst SONY Marvel movie? Absolutley not! Was it the best? Absolutley not. I went in with medium expectations with my 13yo daughter and her best friend. It wasn't a bad time. We had a few giggles and a few sad moments. My daughter and her friend loved it. They love these types of movie because it shows them ""girl power"". 

The movie itself started off slow and I was quite confused at first but everything came together in time and it turned out to be a ghreat origin story. If you are going in looking at the comics as your point of reference then you will be disappointed but if you go in with knowlege of the comics and then expecting a hollywoood twist the you should enjoy it. 

The charachter development was pretty good with one excfeption, The ""Villian"". He was underdeveloped and I feel like they never gave a him a real goal to what he was doing. Dakota was hot and is a great actress but I feel like they could have given her a bigger range of emoptions to her character. Syndey Sweeny, Celeste O' Conner, and Isabela Merced were good but underutilized. 

The story was good and the pace was ok but as I said earlier the movie started off slow and didn't keep my attention until the train scene, but from there it was a good pace.

Bonus: The Soundtrack was an A+"
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Me gustó mucho, fui con bajas espectativas, por si me defraudaba, no se me hizo el mismo nivel del MCU, pero es una película entretenida, que cumple con la introducción de nuevos personajes al mundo de Spiderman."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Worse superhero movie of all time.  I have nothing to add.  Just no.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Started with a decent premise but quickly fell apart… the movie just seemed to drag on and on and on with nothing actually happening.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Lazy writing, silly dialog, unsatisfying ending. Just the worst!"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"*dies of cringe*

Sony what were you thinking, shoving this non-sense. Madame Web could be a 10 times better story than this money grab."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,This will be featured on RedLetterMedia's Best of the Worst. It's so bad that it's good. Dakota Johnson is a prime example of why the word nepotism exists.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie was completely horrible and a total waste of time. should have listened to the terrible reviews and the fact it is a box office bomb that no one went to see.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Genuinely one of the worst films I've seen
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,I wish they give option of 0.1 star rating. Cause this picture deserve this🙂
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"There is no rating available for a movie like this, I knew it was going to be bad, I just never imagined how bad it was going to get. Marvel Studios allowed this to happen and they keep Wondering why the movies and shows keep failing one right after the other, they are out of touch and completely lost what it meant to be a fan...."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Morbius Ironically is better than this movie, this spiderman movies without spiderman are failing. I hope kraven the hunter is sony's last spider villain movie."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"I think it was amazing! I loved the characters and the story, I really liked Cassie's powers. This movie has gotten unnecessary hate, it was really enjoyable and I'm hoping there will be a 2nd movie! ☺️"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"no sense, boring, bad performances."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Maybe the worst movie I have ever seen. Had I not been with my daughter, who wanted to see the movie, I would have walked out 10 minutes in.  Cliche premise, bad acting (especially the ""bad buy"") stupid plot line, and poor CGI.  What is laughable is the whole movie is a setup for sequels. Next time I will pay more attention to Rotten Eggs rating."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Waste of your time and money
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Horribly lazy writing.  So bad. Just so bad.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I loved it. It was interesting to watch. I do want to say, the bad guy should have been a better actor."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,enjoyed it very much. fun comic book movie. don't understand the hate for it. brought the kids and they all loved it too.would give it 7 over 10
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Don't.             .
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,Overall better than I expected.  Definitely some cringe worthy scenes.  But has its moments of suspense and action.  A lot of exposition to explain the origin story. But good time twists to keep you guessing.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,It's an OK movie not the greatest and could have been so much better however having said that the critics score is ludicrously low still worth a watch and many would actually enjoy.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,I'm not sure what Sony was thinking when they made this movie. This movie made me think that Morbius wasn't so bad after all.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Leeenta, leeeeeeenta, leeeeeeeeeenta.
Maaaala, maaaaaaala, maaaaaaaaaala.
Una estafa el tráiler que te saca las únicas partes ""curiosas"" que salen en la película y encima so ""flashes"", ya que es acción pertenece a ""futuras películas"" si es que se llegan a hacer visto el fracaso y estafa de esta película. Muy mal los de sony engañando así al público. Los que dan 5 estrellas (y 4 y 3 !!) a este bodrio han debido de meterse en otra sala y ver otra película......"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Horrível, trailer mentiroso roteiro fraco"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyable and fun! Not too serious, the girls were great, the villain not so much (weird ADR and editing). Loved Dakota Johnson, great comedic timing and chemistry with the tree girls! I recommend!!"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst superhero movies I've seen. And I've seen a lot of it, plus the bar was extremely low...."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"lacklustre story telling, with very mediocre acting and the worst teaser for follow ups I have ever seen…"
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Madame Web is a cinematic masterpiece that effortlessly earns a 10-star rating, standing as a beacon of storytelling, character development, and visual splendor in the realm of film. From the opening scene to the closing credits, this movie captivates the audience, weaving a rich tapestry of narrative depth, emotional resonance, and visual spectacle.

The plot of Madame Web is both intricate and engaging, masterfully balancing complexity with clarity. It takes the audience on a journey through twists and turns that are both surprising and satisfying, demonstrating a profound understanding of narrative pacing and structure. The story is not just about the titular character's journey but also about the themes of destiny, power, and the importance of choice, making it resonate on multiple levels.

Character development is another area where Madame Web shines brightly. Each character is meticulously crafted, with clear motivations, strengths, and weaknesses. The protagonist, portrayed with depth and nuance, embarks on a transformative journey that is both personal and universal. Supporting characters are not mere backdrops but are fully realized individuals who contribute significantly to the narrative and thematic richness of the film.

The acting in Madame Web is nothing short of phenomenal. The cast delivers performances that are powerful, nuanced, and utterly convincing. They bring their characters to life with such authenticity and emotional depth that it's impossible not to be drawn into their world. The chemistry between the actors adds a layer of believability and engagement to the story, making the emotional highs and lows all the more impactful.

Cinematography and special effects in Madame Web are used to stunning effect, creating a visual experience that is both breathtaking and immersive. The film's visual style is distinctive and serves to enhance the storytelling, rather than distract from it. Special effects are seamlessly integrated, supporting the narrative and adding a layer of spectacle without ever feeling gratuitous or overdone.

The soundtrack of Madame Web is another highlight, with a score that perfectly complements the film's tone and emotional arc. The music is both haunting and uplifting, weaving through the narrative to enhance the atmosphere and emotional impact of key scenes. It's a testament to the power of music to elevate cinematic storytelling.

Overall, Madame Web is a film that not only entertains but also challenges and inspires. It's a rare gem that combines all elements of filmmaking artistry to create an unforgettable experience. The movie's impact is profound, leaving a lasting impression on its audience and setting a new standard for what is possible in cinema. Madame Web is not just a film; it's a cinematic journey that deserves every one of its 10 stars."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Overall a good view if you love Marvel, more specifically, the Spider-Man franchise. A few questions were left unanswered, like what happened w/ that missing persons report for the 3 girls, since it doesn't show a resolution to that...only they and the protagonist reconnecting. Bit excessive w/ the jump-scare noises during flash-forward scenes (one or two would have sufficed)."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Its clear theyre setting up for a second part of the story, but this was one of the worst endings Ive ever seen and it hurts my heart cause I had such high hopes. Ill likely watch part 2/the sequel just so I can finally see the trio of girls actually get/use their powers."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's cheesy, yes. It's predictable in places, yes. But it's very watchable, the graphics are great and the soundtrack is BRILLIANT! (It's set in 2003, when I was 17, so the music literally struck a chord with me). The only major complaint I have is the dubbing of the baddies voice, you could literally see his mouth moving at a different pace, VERY annoying. 
I loved the cheese, the storyline and the characters and would recommend. My husband enjoyed it too."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,I can't understand how these people get a chance to make a movie?
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,I think the budget went to marketing because this had the worst CGI I've ever seen in any movie. Oh and the spider people do not fight ONCE. Villain straight out of spy kids the movie
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Typical story about individual with special abilities. Despite no having super strength, speed, she still able to defeat the nemesis. Just enough back story to tell her abilities. Overall good movie."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Is the dialogue sometimes stilted? Yes. Is the Tahar Rahim's villainy absolutely laughable? Oh, absolutely. And is this the best live-action superhero film I've seen in the past five years? Without a doubt. 

Don't go in expecting a critical masterpiece, but appreciate what you get: humour, wit, tongue-in-cheek references, feel-good moments, drama, tension, high-octane action sequences, character development, emotional depth. The first marvel-adjacent property in living memory to not end in a huge CGI fight.

It's not perfect -- at some points, it's painfully awkward -- but it's something that feels new, it's an origin story, it's about human beings as well as heroes, and I left the theatre smiling. Went in expecting something so bad it was good, ended up with something that was just... good!"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The worst movie I have seen in a long time. Many parts of the movie make no sense, loaded with predictable clichees and horrible written characters. You disliked Morbius? It appears to be a master piece compared to this movie."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I had read some bad reviews in regard to this movie, so I was a bit nervous to go watch it but to be honest it wasn’t bad. I enjoyed watching it!"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Please, don't waste your money like I did.   Garbage 🗑️."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,pelicula de mrd mejor miro popeye marino
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"I don’t understand the hate for this movie, it was good and entertaining. It does not connect to the MCU but it hasn’t seemed like any Sony/Marvel movie has. "
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"If you’re the type of person who doesn’t care about good acting, dialogue or cinematography you will enjoy this movie. It is fun to watch, I just don’t understand why Sony is trying so hard to kill the SCU."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It doesn't make sense, it's complete rubbish"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Oh my god…. I'm so glad I didn't have a spoon on me else I'd have melon balled my eyes out. I had hopes for this movie but man it ended up being one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,I had higher expectations but found it very corny at times.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not as bad as all the critics say. 

It does feel a bit like it's just one long set up for another Spider-verse movie, but this time all the characters come from the same universe.

It also has some unremarkable dialog choices, not to mention that Cassie Webb appears to go through several personality changes throughout the whole film (from sassy paramedic to reluctant mom to all seeing cosmic deity).

I still enjoyed some bits from the film, most notable how Cassie reconnects and redefines her relationship with her mother. I did not see that coming. I enjoyed it even though it felt slightly out of place.

I think this movie would have been better if it removed any references to Peter Parker and his family and replaced those scenes with much longer cat/mouse sequences between the viallian and Webb's crew of future superheros.

It's not a good film, but I just quite say its awful. Just kinda bad."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Great Marvell movie. For once the story makes sense and I never got lost . wife and kids loved it!
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Terrible!  Bad acting, terrible cast, tons of plot holes, but at least my kids enjoyed."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,My teenage kids and I all felt this movie was terrible. The actors fell flat and weren't engaging at all. The one-liners felt cheesy. I hope they won't waste money making a sequel out of this stinker.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Terrible film! Moronic, Boring, bad acting, horrific story, finally horrendous directing."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"the script has potential, but the villain was horrible. They never stated why he's evil other than making him that way. Honestly his acting ruined many major scenes because he sounds uninterested and almost dubbed"
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Entirely entertaining action movie, good subsidiary characters, not too heavy on intrusive CGI. Well worth a couple of hours of big screen action. No need to know the whole Marvel canon to enjoy this one-off standalone story. Go have some fun!"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,This was the worst movie I've ever seen. I can't believe this got made.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely terrible, god awful. Sony continues to take good idea and concepts and just run them into the ground. How hard is it to go off the comics. It's literally a step by step play on how to make a marvel movie good. They inserted alot of womens empowerment all throughout the film that was unnecessary. Save your money and time and watch  a different movie"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,I dnt know how to give this 0 stars..it was that bad..what a waste of money
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I am genuinely concerned for those that said this is an amazing movie and the acting was good?? For those not being ironic or facetious  I sincerely recommend psychiatric medication. Please join the rest of us in reality by acknowledging the utter travesty that is this ""film""."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie was so much fun to watch. Don't let critic reviews keep you from watching it!
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Thank you, Sony and the unknown director for ruining another great Spider-Man movie character. When will you be smart enough to sell the rights to Marvel/Disney? Because that's the only way your Spider-Man movies gonna billions with great reviews and audience scores."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,Fun and warm hearted film. Editing was strange at times but it was entertaining and it was nice to see more spider people.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Movie was great loved the characters and acting.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Lol....................
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Horrible. Slow. Bad dialog. Bad acting. 
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Best movie ever the story line was amazing hoping for a sequel
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie was much better then I expected. I am happy I saw it in the theater and hope to see the characters in future films.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"LOVED IT! Very enjoyable, I don't know why people are hating on it, I just wished there were more action!"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie had the worst acting I have seen in years. Also, this movie was just plain irritating from beginning to end. I can't believe they Okayed this movie for release!"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Dakota Johnson is attractive and well read as an actress but this is her worst work. Without Sidney and Isabela this would be zero stars.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I see a lot of people absolutely dunking on this movie but it's not worse than Morbius, like I've heard people claim (of course Morbius sets the bar extremely low). I found it to be just another generic superhero movie that hits all the same cliches but without any of the charm, really. 

Sony needs to figure out what they're doing with this whole ""Sonyverse"" they've been haphazardly cobbling together. It's obvious they want the success of the MCU, but this is our fourth outing into this Sonyverse and we still have no idea who this Earth's Spider-Man is, y'know, the character all these side characters were made on the back of? What would've easily made this a solid 4/5 stars for me would have been SOME KIND of cameo or confirmation of an existing Spider-Man, but we're left with nothing, as if Sony is too afraid to embrace the most central character to the Spider-Man IP: Spider-Man himself.

With how mid this movie was, I'll likely not go see Kraven The Hunter and Venom 3's trailers will seriously need to woo me to get me to see it in a theater."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,I loved this movie and I hope for a sequel
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Masterpiece is kinda over the top but it's very enjoyable and you will be happy.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"There were some parts I could see what they were aiming for but the dialogue, tonal shifts, exposition and direction was all over the place. Typical Sony mess."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"My friends and I enjoyed it! It was a little slow in the beginning, but we liked the movie and it was different from other films. It was cool! There will definitely be a sequel, so we can't wait for that!"
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"The story could be better, the action was good. "
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie was utterly disappointing, and that’s to say the least. I understand making an origin story movie is hard but they seriously failed with this one. At no point in the first hour and a half of the movie did ANYTHING happen, there was only 5-10 minutes of action in the entire movie and that’s being generous (counting the “future vision” as action). The trailers for this movie are highly deceiving, making it look like it’s going to be a movie about her AND the girls. It’s almost two hours of straight talking and bad Pepsi commercials. We definitely wouldn’t have spent $80 to come see it if we had known this is how bad it was going to be."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A film that literally no Marvel or Spider-Man fan asked for, yet here it is, and getting dumped on like everyone expected. Where in the multiverse do these characters emerge from, because hopefully that multiverse never gets visited in the Marvel time-line again."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"give this movie a break. for what it is, it is rather entertaining. some over acting some underacting but enjoyable. interesting spider lore of an alternate reality. i have read and collected comic books for 50 years and know webb's story well. we cannot expect these movies to be exact copies of the books, wheres the fun in that? get some popcorn, check your expectations at the door and just enjoy the night out at the movies."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Don't know what everyone's complaining or bad reviews are about. It's a good movie. I would see the sequel. All the stars acting, movie plot and scenes were good."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not enough chick's and not lame enough.

This movie was rough, boring, uninspired, not even Dakota Johnson could salvage this. 

Brutal."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Just finished watching this movie in the theater. I enjoyed it. It is different from the comic book origin story but is still pretty good. I hope that more movies with the characters are made in the future but, considering how much this movie is getting torched by critics I'm not optimistic about that."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"If I could rate it 0 stars I would and I'd still think that was too many stars for this ""film."""
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Underrated, doesn't deserve this much hate and quite enjoyable, however, vocal mixing is off"
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"People are being haters and take themselves too seriously. I personally had a good time and thought it was funny. It's supposed to be camp, not a masterpiece. I would recommend!"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,The worst Spider-Man movie ever! I liked venom and venom let there be carnage and morbid was just ok anyway. Yeah it's garbage the writhing is terrible it goes in for way to goddam long and don't even get me started with that rip off spider man character!
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Lots of amazing character development and I'm really really hoping they make another movie!!
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The worst spider-man movie we have ever gotten. How come last year we got the masterpiece called ""spider-man: across the spider verse"", now we have a stupid cash grab that brings you all in with the spider man aspect and ruins it? Once I got out of that theater I said in my head "" finally "" because of how bad it was, would not recommend 0/10, if I could give zero stars, I would."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Loved it and can't wait to see more.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not as horrible as one might expect, but thoroughly meh. Felt like a souped-up TV pilot. Uninspired acting and questionable plot points. I'd watch it again before I would watch Eternals again, though."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I have no idea why it's getting trashed so badly. Yes, the dubbing on Ezekiel's voice is terrible. Otherwise, it's a typical mid-tier superhero movie. I don't get the seething hate."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It felt like a superhero movie pre-Iron Man; more like the early Spider-Man movies. 
Not nearly as bad as what I expected based on reviews I have heard! The bad guy dialogue was generic…but it's a superhero movie! Honestly, with the right director a sequel could be awesome!"
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Entertaining, good movie! I like the easter egg!"
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Great Marvel movie! Action and a wonderful storyline.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It WASN'T as bad as everyone made it seem to be, I went in with 0 expectations of it being a good movie. It not the best but it's not bad. I wish though that the dialogue wasn't as long as it seemed to be as well as the unending plot holes that made the movie not make sense sometimes. But it had some good scenes. Not a lot of fight scenes but what was shown was good especially during the end 🤣👌🏻 finally it did make us kind of laugh in some scenes. I wish the MCU actually did it thought might be a tiny bit better. But it honestly isn't as bad as how the people made it seem."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Not really what I expected
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Contrary to the general belief, I really really enjoyed this movie. A great origin story that introduced multiple characters, yet set them up perfectly. 

Only thing about the movie that I wasnt convinced by was the acting of the villan. But in reality, he takes the back seat when it comes to the developing relationship and understanding between the protagonists, so it didn't really affect my score for this movie. I am also not against an all female superheroe movie, but all of the ones I have seen before feel forced. This movie did not feel forced at all, and the characters really worked well with eachother. 

I have seen a lot of reviews saying that the lack of action and fights scenes is the reason the movie is ""boring"". I personally feel like the amount of action was perfect for the type of movie we were presented. There is a lot more to a superhero movie than action scenes and explosions. 

I honestly don't understand all of the hatred towards the film, apart from going off of what their favorite social media influencer has to say about the movie. I would recommend to go out, watch the movie, and formulate your own opinion!"
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Eu gostei do filme 🤩 acho que ele sofre de um grande efeito manada🐾 como tem muita gente falando mau é mais fácil só crítica igual a todo mundo 🤷🏻‍♂️
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was a very boring movie unless your goal is to fall asleep. The characters were bland and mundane story.  I like Dakota Johnson in other movies but she is miscast as a leading Marvel superhero. She just did could not pull it off
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I definitely would say it was better than i expected. It did feel rushed and it wasn't a lot of action or big budget fights. Some how for me that wasn't that big of a deal for what it was trying to do it did ok. It felt like they weren't sure if they had the rights to name drop Spiderman in any way which was weird. It's like the crew wasn't sure what they could and couldn't connect and that was felt every time they made a nudge towards Spiderman's future. I would of loved diving into Webb's powers more in the movie they do enough to be acceptable but i would loved to see her gain even more polish during the film. I also would have loved if the Three co stars had more actual time on screen doing more than being damsels in distress. This is a good launcher movie for other movies to come and we will see these girls again which is cool but I need them to be established and fully fleshed out in the next entry. I liked the movie's use of camera angles and how they conveyed what she was seeing and confused she was telling the future in the beginning. This movie felt rushed but it wasn't a disaster by no means and it wasn't horrible like the media made it out to be. As far as sony's other titles it falls in line with venom, Amazing Spiderman 1-2 and Morbius."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,More like madame suck
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Incredible cast, phenomenal acting, and female empowerment. What a fantastic trifecta! The story line is perfect and it makes an amazing connection to the marvel universe. I can't wait to see more marvel movies with these characters! Marvel definitely needs more badass female representation like this! Highly recommend"
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"An entertaining and enjoyable super hero origin movie.  I can't lie, it was nice to see a Marvel movie sans most of the Disney social messages.  Strong but believable characters, teenagers acting like teenagers and female characters using their intelligence and bonding together."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Personally really enjoyed the movie all the way through.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Absolute and utter garbage. Just when you thought the movie couldn't suck any worse, it somehow manages to sink even deeper."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Read reviews saying how bad this movie was however, I found it to be pretty decent. I brought my mom and tried theater ears app and that was a must so, loved that I could watch it in English while my mom heard it in spanish"
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,It was a really good movie!
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Best movie I have ever seen
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Loved it. Writing could have been better but Dakota Johnson did great for what she was given to work with.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was good and entertaining, it’s the first movie probably if they do a second one would be much better!! Go see it!! "
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,the kids liked it but it wasn't that good to me
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,I have one word. Terrible.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,It was decent. Not the greatest but not as bad as social media making it out to be. Wish the girls were actually in their suits more. Maybe we will get a 2nd movie where they do
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,I’m gonna have to say that movie was phenomenal (kinda) and I loved the visuals and Dakota’s performance was one hundred percent awesome!
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,This isn't even a Superhuman movie why do they keep making these movies so bad.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Went in not really knowing what to expect from a Sony verse marvel movie but can say I was pleasantly surprised by it. Definitely a must watch
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,I don’t review many. Usually just the really good ones and the really bad ones. This one was soooooo bad. 
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Very very good movie!!! Must see!
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Entertaining! Would have enjoyed more it more if they worked in more actions from the girls future selves, but overall I found it to be a decent movie. I think people find anything to nitpick when it comes to female led hero movies. Got my support tho!"
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"We liked it. It starts a little slow but then shifts just before half way. Nice cinematics, decent story (kinda dark). Acting was good, lots of big actresses and actors. Overall we give it a 4 out of 5 stars. well done Sony/Marvel!"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Very boring. Slow and tepid storyline. No character context or build. Dialogue was bleak. Not even worth the money to nap in comfy chairs.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,It was enjoyable. Could be better. I would like to know how Sony will fix the script. In Spiderman in the spider verse they said that only one spider man can live in each universe. Bow we see 3 spiderwoman here. (obviously their own name) in general I would love to see the result of  mixing all universes with madame webb
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,I wish I could give negative stars. It was that bad.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I was looking forward to this movie. Unfortunately, I found it uninspiring, uninteresting, and underdeveloped. The plot holes were numerous, and easily avoidable, which begs the question if anyone even read the script.  Quite disappointed."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this movie. I don't get why it's getting so much hate! I'd love to see more of this storyline in the future!
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie, Dakota Johnson great as always"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Fifty shades of Madam Web was fifty shades of disaster!
It feels like it was written and produced by an AI, a Pentium 2 AI."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Movie is much better than what I had been reading online. It has a solid story, funny in parts and the action is decent. Fanboys are upset because there aren't 40 characters running around in tights."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I have been hyped about this movie for
months, and then I read such horrible reviews about it that I almost didn't want to see it. Let me tell you, I'm so glad I did. I LOVED this movie. It kept me intrigued, the comedy/banter we expect with Dakota was there, and there were some nice connections to the spider verse. It was the perfect Saturday night movie."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie SUCKED! Thank God there was no post-credit scene
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"When the trailers, posters or TV spots came out, it looked promising. good and entertaining.

but getting to see it...
You could be the worst disappointment of your life.

bad editing, bad script, bad acting, bad cgi, horribly characterized costumes and the only thing that stands out is the cast.

I would give this movie a 0. but since what rotten tomatoes allows is 0.5

Unfortunately I will have to give it half a point or 0.5.
unfortunate marvel and sony"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Horrible movie 
Sony just can't release anything good but animated spider verse movies which is sad. Movie not worth the time doesn't feel like a Spider universe movie or even a super hero movie. Don't waste the money or time. Only people that are none marvel fans give this movie a good review as they are NPC movie watchers. Everyone has an opinion but giving a good review on something that is terrible is just not right. This movie is the type of movie you tell your kids to watch on a movie night and puts them to bed time."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"I really liked it. Felt it was messy in some parts, but don't really get the hate. Dakota did a good job in the portrayal of Madame-Web. Adding to on of the best universes in Marvel the Spidey-Universe"
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,She is a Great Actress.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Madame Web is receiving a lot of hate from critics and audience members alike. I don't quite understand why. Was it perfect? Absolutely not. The script needed some clear revisions and overall the movie needed a bit of an edit. However, it is like people have forgotten that this was an origin story- which typically have some performance issues. I felt like the story in this was explained well, the action was good and the story moved along well. It seems like the super nerd critics tend to hate on all the female driven Marvel films which is unfortunate.  I personally am looking forward to the future of these characters now that they are fleshed out and I am looking forward to seeing this all come together with the MCU and other Sony properties. Hoping Sony does get it together though as it seems like they have made some poor choices recently.  Overall I give it a 3.5 just because I think the script could have improved but the overall plot was good. It was still a fun and entertaining movie and I think it will inspire more young girls to get into comic book movies in the future."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great female empiwerment
Disliked all the Pepsi and other commercial plugs.  Way too many"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I saw this movie for free and I still feel ripped off. 90% of the time the villains words didn't even match his mouth. Writing was abysmal. Dakota Johnson's acting was so clearly phoned in, it kept taking me out of the movie. Madame web's costume at the end was so horrible I promise with everything i love, I could've made a better one with even macaroni art. I had more enjoyment playing with the Dune worm bucket in the lobby than I did watching this movie.
I have NEVER reviewed a movie on here but after this i felt compelled to do so.
HALF STAR, DO BETTER SONY."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie and best theater in Savannah Ga
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,I thought was a great prequel to all the spider man movies and has great potential moving forward for sequels and the future of spider-man world. I would definitely watch it multiple times.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,They could have set up sooo many movies with this one show... introducing Miles or Peter as the end result...so disappointing..
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,I enjoyed a look into how Madame webs were weaved into her early days. A must for any marvel fans out there.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,This was good   The critics are wrong.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"I thoroughly enjoyed Madame Web, and I would even go as far as to say it is one of my favorite Marvel movies. It really does have everything: action, camp, emotion. I would absolutely watch this movie again and I will be HEARTBROKEN if there is not a sequel. In summary, I loved Madame Web."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It was pretty bad. I couldn't get over the bad dubbing for ceiling guy, the insane I'm flying to Peru last minute on the Concorde apparently for how fast it was (and on a paramedic's salary no less), and so much more. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it. Do yourself a favor and wait until it's free."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,They survived off pure luck and coincidence
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,parece el detrás de cámaras jajajaj
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Watched Madame Web today and this movie was so much fun!! I enjoyed it!!
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,I never go by what the critics say about a movie. I really enjoyed the movie I was thoroughly entertained. I hope they continue on this was a good action-packed movie.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"I absolutely loved this movie! Dakota has the best comedic timing. I went in expecting to dislike the three teen characters and I ended up loving the whole cast as a unit.  I know many are upset that the lore has been altered but honestly I felt like this fresh idea took me personally on a great journey and invigorated the story for me. I hope Dakota comes back for the sequels and doesn't get chased off by the community.   I understand how important marvel lore is to everyone but they were clear this story happens before Toby's Spiderman.  For a movie set in 2003 I really enjoyed the call backs to how technology was then, seeing the blockbusters, the lined phones, and the paper billboards.  I enjoyed the characters dynamics in the movie and how Dakota's character made it clear she wasn't going to be the hero.  she was just trying to do what she thought was the right thing.  The growth Cassie goes through and the healing she comes to terms with with her mother.  I am so excited to see where they take this and I hope to see Dakota again as Madame Web."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This is another lead who has had a traumatic past and is withdrawn from humanity.  I am tired of grumpy ""heroes.""
At first, Madam Web is in trouble for kidnapping the girls.  Then nothing came of it. One girl has wealthy absentee parents, but her housekeeper never checks on her.
However, the biggest problem for me is that she kept driving back and forth in stolen vehicles, which had also been involved in accidents, but she was never stopped by the police."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie was well made. The story plot builds up to a sequel. The special effects was good. No boredom at all. Don't listen to the movie critics.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Was more origin story then a marvel movie wed all come to know and love. There were many boring lines used that were to scripted and didnt feel natural in the context of the conversations.  Wait for it on Disney + in a month rather than seeing it in the theater.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A film with many flaws, fast and confusing scenes, that try to find meaning with the passage of time without being able to achieve it.  With many flashforwads that do not support the plot and on the contrary show inconsistencies to the film."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Kept you going the whole movie. You get the back story, the beginning to the super hero as the story goes to get you geared up for more !"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Dakota Johnson didnt fit the part.  Hokey how she found the exact place her mom was in the Amazon
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Overall decent. The action scenes were fine for the most part, and the concept of introducing Madame Web's character into the SSU will hopefully yield good results."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Comparado aos filmes recentes da Marvel/Disney, ""Madame Teia"" não merece as críticas que está recebendo. Eu não li nenhum dos quadrinhos das mulheres aranhas então não posso dizer se é fiel ou não, mas achei o filme uma experiência sólida. Dê uma chance ao filme se você é um super fan do aranha."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie is a pretty decent film considering I was really expecting a flop. Comic fans may nitpick this movie to death, comparing the ends in and outs about how the story or effect or powers should be different. I do like comics but I will give a superhero movie a chance, I read the stories for the comics (I don't need to watch it too. However for those of us who just go to the movies to enjoy them you may be pleasantly surprised. Though I will say the villain is not.....I'm not sure what to say about him,...he is flat"
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"It wasn't bad, it's not on Par with Disney quality MCU movies, but if you go into it can be enjoyable."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Awkward from beginning to end.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I think it suffered from the sag/aftra strike and I assume in the following months and through 2024 we'll continue to feel the repercussions. 
But overall a good origin movie.  As long as Sony doesn't scrap it I'm excited to see what the sequels will do for the story of Madame Web"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's not the best comic book movie, but it's enjoyable"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Film is HOT GARBAGE!!!  Marvel/Sony please stop. Take a break, mothball all superhero movies for a few years.  Plan out another group of films, hire some great writers, and give them time....it's getting worse and worse.  You have great IP's stop destroying them!!!"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Really liked the storyline and female characters.  Villain needed more backstory.  Overall, liked it"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It was alright, definitely not a super hero movie"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"this movie was terrible and uneventful and the actors did a terrible job, and the writing was dreadful. marvel should be embarrassed. now i think of marvel as a horrendous legacy. another horrible thing about this movie was that the conversations were so bland and again the acting as which they were about to get murdered was not so real. the story line was not soo bad but the acters, camera, angles and everything else about this movie was horrible, i do demand a refund. do not watch this movie, i could have been spending time with my family, instead i wasted $29 for this horrendous film. this guy sitting next to me fell asleep in the first 5 minutes. i had to wake him up when it was over.DO NOT RECOMMEND."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,The movie had no correspondence.  It was a mix of look at this and what is this. For such good actresses they portrayed their parts with no passion for the role. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this movie
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I hated this movie, the acting was bad, the editing was bad, the characters were poorly written, to annoying for my tastes. If you were to ask me I would not recommend you watch this movie at all"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,It wasn't great but a nice enough movie.  A lot of unanswered questions.  Didn't really like the ending and didn't fully explain either.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I don't know what I'm doing, I completely fell asleep while watching the movie"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Not nearly as bad as I was led to believe. That being said, there was some very clunky setup (I suppose it could be because she foresaw the need) and the villain was very poorly acted."
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Going in after seeing the reviews I thought it would be awful. To my surprise, I found Madame Web to be an amazing movie. The way it is directed is so beautiful and the plot really feels you in throughout the movie. 10/10"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This is a 2-hour teaser for a sequel that will never be made. If they had completed the origin story and the girls had obtained their powers and saved the day by the end of the movie, then this would have been an average superhero movie. As is, it drags out the story much too long and is marginally tolerable."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I found this film to be pretty good, very entertaining. It's flawed but definitely not fatally so. I'd recommend it"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Esse filme é HORRÍVEL! Nota 01 ! Pior filme que já assisti ! Não tem Nada de bom, NADA 👎"
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,It has a great story behind which has to be pushed beyond one movie. It builds well. The only thing which seemed uncompleted are special effects. They seem very unnatural.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,It was a fun time! The cinematography around old New York was fun and the costume designer did a great job with the the clothes. Setting up this trio feels like they have great chemistry. I do however wish they handled the Peruvian origin story a bit better but I feel fully optimistic a universe could do well around these 3
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,WEBTASTIC! This film strings all the webs
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Amazing, kept me on my feet! Don't listen to the reviews!"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Absolutely abismal flop that makes a 2 hour runtime feel like 4 hours! Went to see it on Valentines day hoping for something lighthearted but wasn't expecting anything great due to Disney's current track record. This movie was so bad it caused me and my girlfriend to have an argument. 1/10 do not reccomend.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great origin film 
Smart, funny, heartwarming.
Corny ass villain 
Bad voice effects sometimes 
Overall it's needlessly hated on
People need to get a life and stop jumping on every hate train they see"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,great movie....great origin story for Madame Web and gets the backstory of the other characters set up for any future movies that may come along.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's ok, not bad but still had some issue."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Today I owe Morbius an apology. A very lackluster and dull experience. The trailer is very misleading. Buyer beware!!!
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It was a confusing and awkward mess from the start, and it didn't get better. The acting is tired at the best of times, and the main villain feels so unenthusiastic about what he's doing (and what he's doing makes no sense). There's no attention to detail, and seemingly no real consequences for the actions the Dakota's character takes (apparently you can just steal a cab in New York and keep it for weeks without anyone ever noticing). It's insulting how bad this was."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Worst marvel movie EVER. I have seen better film on teeth! Atrocious dialogue.  The 4 main characters are potential heroes who RUN from every situation. The script was probably generated by AI, because the storyline is weak and the dialogue is weaker."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,not as bad as they say
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's pretty good, it's entertaining, it's a movie. Doesn't deserve the harsh reviews. People need to calm down and just enjoy! :)"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"""Put a chick in it, make her lame."" CHECK
Black girl, Hispanic girl, DEI villain - CHECK

Good story, good acting, compelling characters - NOT NEEDED.

This is a remarkably bad movie. I would have assumed that studios would learn, but of course to learn one must have brain. Horrible movie, do not waste your time or money."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Fraudulent movie. Trailer scenes not in the movie. 
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,HORRIBLE !!! This movie proves Sony doesn't care about the character and the fandom. All they care about is being greedy to keep the  spiderman movie rights. This movie is a scam
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The amount of hate this film is receiving interested me so I had to watch it. I know nothing of Madame Web and it was an origin story style film. Her powers are definitely different from other characters making flashy fight scenes non existent. After watching many of these super hero films I understand others complaints. People who want the grand scale, high pace, adrenaline enduced superhero experience won't be getting that with Madame Web. You get an origin story where she barely knows how to use her powers. I didn't think it was THAT bad. Middle of the road for me."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,Not the greatest movie of all time by any stretch of the imagination but it was entertaining. Could have been some more action and Sims character was nothing more than a brooding generic evil guy but passable for a lazy afternoon watch.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Despite the one-dimensional villain and underdeveloped supporting characters, Madame Web is still a good average superhero film that's enjoyable thanks to Dakota Johnson's performance."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Greatest marvel movie ever. Better than endgame
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,In the minority but I enjoyed the movie. It felt fresh from the more recent super hero movies. A good origin story movie in my opinion.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was a nice movie. I don't know why it's getting so much hate, but I'm not a movie critic. You should go see it if you like marvel movies."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,It was good. Loved the theater
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I was expecting much worse with the reviews I read. It easily passed the time. Not a favorite,  but not nearly as terrible as people are saying. It held my interest."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Waste of money and time! I really had high expectation smh
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Captivating movie that showcased female superheros finally without the clevage. Dakota Johnson did an outstanding job and portrayed a character that was very relatable. This movie was a fresh take with the superhero getting their powers later in like instead of as a teenager. Although an action movie, the focus was on the mind instead of brute on brute fighting. 5 stars!"
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Thought the movie was amazing. The suits were as comic accurate as could be. Thought the plot was ok, and at some points it was a little slow pace. Other than that amazing movie. Need a part 2 immediately!!"
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,4.5 not a must see but Awesome!
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Finally a reason to go to the movies. Dakota was superb in the role and I can't wait to see the others in action with the sequel.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Was a pretty good movie. Don't let the low rating deter you. Full of action not superheroes that's why the fanboys are trying to kill it. If it was a non spider world movie it would be getting much better reviews.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Wasn’t awful. Not enough character build up. Very little information about Ezekiel.  Would go see a sequel
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie was good, it’s not the worst movie as people have been saying. It needed more action but overall it was a good movie."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Probably one of the worst Marvel movies  I've ever seen. Dialogue and action were terrible.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,They don’t explain anything if you  don’t read a lot of comics of Spiderman you will be lost t
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It wasn't a bad movie. The plot was cool. The foreshadowing of Ben and Peter Parker was fun. The dialog hit some weird points, but from what (in all honesty, little that) I know of Madam Web, she doesn't act or talk normal. Which makes sense for someone that is watching the craziest case of deja vu EVER on top of multiple universes ALL THE TIME."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,We loved it and would see it again. Very entertaining. Hoping to see more about these characters. Happy we did not trust all the negative reviews from Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,The worst Marvel movie EVER!
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Overall the movie was good, but I was expecting a bit more action."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,i thought my mom never cared about me
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I now have to rewatch Catwoman, in order to determine which ""hero"" movie is truly the worst.  At least this elevates Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.   So glad that I didn't waste money taking my kids to see this.   I think I'll have to start listening to my 12 year old daughter's impression of movie trailers, as she definitely called this one."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"First off I liked it. The color and the photography in general was sharp and natural. Each shot was well lit and the color pallet was full spectrum. It took a bit to get used to the flash forward devise--and it worked really well. The acting, although criticized elsewhere in these reviews, seemed really natural and uncontrived--all of the leads except the villain who was over-the-top vicious all of the time. The special effects were introspective type not big and flashy and the emotional development the The Girls seemed genuine. Not overly violent for this type of film, nor any F-bombs. News flash: There is an Uncle Ben in this universe (eventually) and all the adults in the film are competent, working, and relatively smart. So were the adolscent girls, although it took them some time to drop the attitude and make that journey as mentioned above. Score fit the action. Not overly bombastic although fully-orchestrated. Nice credits theme song at the end. I guess I must have taught junior high too long in my career, but I enjoyed my time with these young ladies."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,Was expecting more but was mildly entertained. It was okay.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"poorly written, cliched themes, daddy issues, subpar performances."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,It will keep you on your feet. Action movie . Very captivating.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Please dont listen to all of these bad reviews, this movie was NOT as bad as these ""Critics"" say it is.... although not great it still was a overall not bad movie, Dakota is a little dry and reminds me of Bella in Twilight a little bit but it was not a bad movie overall...id say go watch and judge for yourself"
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie!!!! My daughter and I loved it. Critics are idiots!!
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,I need a notification regarding the Blu-ray release date
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Much better than the reviews made it out to be. My wife and I both loved it and can't wait to see more from the girls!
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Madame Web is a large and convoluted character in the comics. She has so much potential that it would be nearly impossible to make a perfect movie about her. That said, the big let down in this movie isn't the ladies. It's the guys. Zack Scott and Tahar Rahim gave lukewarm performances at best. Celeste O'Connor was a badass that I couldn't look away from. Enjoy the movie and the talented beauties that populate it."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,I don't know what everyone is talking about. This movie was awesome! Not the best but it was great!
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Much better than anticipated. Left me wanting more and can't wait for sequels!
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Some people that worked on that film should never work again!
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Hands down one of the worse movies that I've seen. Terrible dialogue. The best part of the movie was when it was over. It sucks that this is attached to Mavel.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,It's actually a pretty good introduction movie to some supporting roles for MCU. If you compare it with MCU ofcourse its nothing but as stand alone (maybe) pretty convincing.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"É um filme divertido, é ruim,sim,mas é divertido e melhor que muitos por aí,gostei sim e para mim é um dos meus favoritos esse ano"
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed it. Love all the characters, looking forward to seeing them again hopefully. Live action spiderverse just got enjoyably fleshed out a little more."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Wasn’t sure what to expect, but I definitely enjoyed it."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,this was a pretty good movie! i enjoyed it and i am looking forward to what it is setting up! some of the plot points were a little silly but overall very entertaining and enjoyable.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,I think I cringed at every single piece of dialogue from this movie. Worst acting ever I've ever seen.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"i loved it, most of the bad reviews clearly were not paying attention"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Makes Morbius look like a masterpiece. At least Morbius had memeable content...
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not any real redeeming qualities to this movie, the only reason I don't give it a half star is that it was fun to laugh at how awful it was."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,I thought it was a fun time!
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,I really likes this movie. I have not spent a lot of time on the marvel movies but this being a female lead I thought I would try one. I look forward to future Madam Web movies as well.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Decided to go in with the impression of the first trailer....  Five minutes into the film I thought the character was speaking to me when I heard  ""You're making the wrong decision""."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"La verdad es disfrutable, el villano es el que siento que no tiene potencia no te da escalofrío cuando aparece en escena, la verdad compararla con morbius es algo garrafal , porque morbius no tiene ni pies ni cabeza"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Ten film to jakaś pomyłka choć i tak lepszy od The Marvels. Oszukanie swoiste widza 3 minutowym czasem ekranowym dziewczyn które w filmie nie są wcale w swoich strojach a jedynie w wizji... żenada
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,So this is what happens when you hire writers that have never read a comic and then let them have access to hard drugs. Bleedin awful and I have seen awful and this is it.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"this movie had so much potential to be a good movie but i feel like it was executed so poorly. nothing made sense. the scenes that should've been exciting weren't portrayed that way. and the ending was such a let down. again, the idea behind could have been so good. but the execution did not do it justice."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was a ""cheeky"" little side trip into rhe spider multiverse.  Honestly. It was more enjoyable to watch than other recent super hero releases(the latest Marvel or further back the Elementals).  I would watch a sequel in this series."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"If you thought Morbius, you may think this movie is just OK. As bad as Morbius was, this movie manages to be even worse, and I did not think that was possible. I am talking Battlefield Earth level bad."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I have not left a movie review in a long time. I typically avoid critics and any news or buzz. I always watch CB movies. I even liked a few that everyone hated. Soooooooo I decided to go last night and hit up the theater to ""this."" Soooo do movie execs even do any research ?!?!
Do they even pick up a comic book? Do they watch any material where the characters were used. I am the point where I am no longer watching a Sony / Marvel movie. I'm done. This movie is terrible. Poor Dakato. Was she at gun point forced to make this movie. Or were all of them ?"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Has to be in the top 5 Worst movies ever made. poor script, poor acting, terrible plot, bas special effects. Dakota although a pretty face, CAN NOT ACT!"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,Far from a perfect movie but also far from the dud that everyone says it is…the villain in this movie is poorly cast and his dialogue is weird bc you never see him talking but the overall movie and origin of a marvel character I know nothing about was interesting but the acting and directing felt lacking.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Everything I heard about this movie leading to its release led me to expect it was going to be terrible. I just do not understand. There has to be some kind of conspiracy to cover up the fact that this is actually a pretty great movie. It was so much better than the last several movies/shows I have seen from the MCU. It didn’t have that same familiar boring feeling that all comic book movies seem to have these days. If you are not already a spider-verse fan, I figure maybe there is nothing here for you. But if you like that kind of thing, I think you are in for a treat."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Throw up emoji! Make movies great again! Please!
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Man. This movie sucked. From the very beginning you just know it's going to be bad. Bad CGI. Cringey acting. Stupid storyline. Characters feel and looked cheap. Sony needs to stop touching super hero movies or come up with their own.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Having heard how bad this was I was curious to see if that was truly the case. Unfortunately it is true. It is so boring. To have a super hero who occasionally sees into the future does not work. Can't imagine there will be a sequel but if there is then I'm out.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not sure who wanted to be there less, me as a watcher or the actors in the movie."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I didn't understand anything, but it was more or less interesting"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Creo es una buena película de origen, si en un futuro pueden unir a madame web con Spiderman del MCU sería una buena mezcla."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,It's honestly not as bad as people are making it out to be!
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madam web has got to be one of the worst film of 2024 his my positive on the movie we get the story of how she got her powers by learning it and find out her powers work my negative about it, it was has if they rushed the film story and we barley even got any suit from beginning till the end my negative about it we don't not get any Spider-Man reference and posted credit scene"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"this movie is good until... spoiler alert I won't say, but you will see"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This Movie is so bad that Sony would lose less money calling it tax write-off. Boring story that makes little sense, bad cgi, wooden unconvincing acting etc etc . Name anything you would see in a bad movie and this movie has it all and more.
 I am only glad that we watched this on a monthly movie pass (along with 2 other people in my cinema.)
Normally i would say wait to see it on streaming but in this case I think most people would find something more interesting and enjoyable to do in the same time, such as watering your plants, cutting your toenails or just watching the rain fall.
It really is Bad with a capital B."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,The best movie that I saw it showed how confident Cassie was overall it is a pretty good Spider-Man movie
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"From the writers that brought you the last Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) film comes an even worse SSU film.

The plot barely made any sense, the acting from half the cast members (namely, Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim) were poor, the characters weren't memorable, the cinematography was all over the place, the special effects were very outdated, and certain scenes dragged on in a very awkward way.

I don't know what the long term goal is for Sony when it comes to making all these Spider-Man spinoff films without Spider-Man or in conjunction with Marvel Studios, but if ""Madame Web"" is any indication, it's definitely a step in the wrong direction.  Save your money.

PS - no mid or post credit scenes."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,one of the leading candidates for the worst movie of the year
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Just can't believe this got green lit. The villain and Sydney sweeney were so bad
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Waste of time. So many things in this movie make absolutely no sense. Feels like it's just cobbled together by teenagers late for a team project.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,I read that a lot of people didn’t like it. I loved it. I love anything Marvel related.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Fifty shades of horribleness ... cringeworthy action and dialogue throughout the movie.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie doesn't warrant a long review. Simply put absolutely worse movie we've seen in theaters. Not just for a superhero movie but movie in general. God awful and misleading trailer with 90% of what was shown being a guys nightmare 20 minutes into the movie. You never see the girls fight or in costume other than the nightmare scene. The rest of the movie is them running and being told to stay in place so that the bad spider man doesn't get you. First action scene was 140 minutes in and then the movie ended. She tells the girls she can see the future and will protect them then credits roll
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Weak story full of Spider Man references but without Spider Man.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,I’m actually very impressed at how terrible this movie was. It was like they were trying to F*** these actors careers up. I’m actually astonished it got approved for world wide release. Multiple people need to be fired for letting this hit theaters. Sony you should be ashamed of yourselves. 
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Terrible super hero movie had promise but it poorly directed, very bad acting, and terrible customs. Please Sony sell Spiderman property back to Marvel."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie isn’t worth the hype for me! Idk why the hell they’re making this movie 👎🏾
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Muito exagero quem diz que é uma bosta. Pessoalmente gostei bastante, ótima trilha sonora e com bastante ação. Só não ir com expectativas de ver um Vingadores Guerra Infinita e vai dar tudo certo."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,So trash. Dont even bother to watch this. I hope it will get deleted👍
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Worth the matinee ticket. Character development can be long but thats expected, the villain could have been casted much better. Dakota played her role well, some spiderman content was included, I didnt expect that so it was nice aHa moments. Ending could have been better, but most of these bad reviews are closed minded. Go check it out for yourself!"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie damaged my brain throughout this whole movie. With all due respects with the casts in this movie. The directing, the writing, and the pacing is very mediocre and slow which dragged this whole movie apart for me to be interested."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Worst movie ever. Biggest waste of money with serious buyers remorse in this day in age when ticket prices are expensive as heck only to end up with a bad taste right after.

Worse than morbius"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The girls don't even get powers in this movie, this movie is a scam. Don't waste your money on this hell don't buy the DVD either. The villain was after those because the thought they would get powers an kill him. But turns out madam web was the one to kill him. The action is trash in this movie. The trailer sold you a lie. You'll never see the girl with the powers or with Spidey suits on.


The trailer shows then righting, but when you watch the movie those are just flashes of what could happen. boo boo boo boo"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,An incoherent mess that feels like 20 different Final Destination scripts mashed together into something that can only be described as slop. This isn't funny anymore.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Loved this movie and so did the person I went with .  Great actors and story . I don't get the critics response . Now a days all the movies they give lower scores to are great and the high review ones almost always are unwatchable. I recommend seeing this
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Plot must have written by a child. Weak acting at best. I miss when Hollywood used to be able to make good movies
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is such a good film. Due to there being nothing else on at the cinema we decided to think about going to see it. But unfortunately the terrible ratings put us off. Despite this we still decided to go, and we found out the reviews were really wrong in our opinions. It was nice to watch a movie which wasn't just another film about Spiderman for example. This film is really interesting and tense and cool to find out about Cassandra Web. But the goggles for the spiderpeople take away half a star. 💀"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"There's absolutely no purpose for this movie. The villain is completely stupid and doesn't make sense. Madame web powers are so stupid. Action scenes were stupid, the acting was mediocre. The fact this piece of crab got approved for release is beyond me. What a joke"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madam Webb:..

Complete garbage of a movie. If you watched already, see if you can do the same as I can, attempt to get a refund and an apology from the movie production. 

You only get to see the spider girls in the bad dude's dream. He has a vision in his dream that they kill him. The rest of the movie is all 4 of them running away from him and a constant repeat of the sanrio, that makes you feel like you're watching Final destination movie. At the end of the movie you get to see the girls in the custom one last time for a couple of seconds from Madam Web's future vision. The only reference that they make about spiderman is Peter being born at the hospital. No after credits.  

I just saved you time and money.... don't watch this movie, terrible acting, plot and action."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"I think it was a really good story that focused on her  and how she became Madame web and I do hope they make another one, a real good chick flick I think and should be watched by others and not go on reviews, 😀"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"pior filme de todos os tempos da historia da humanidade my god , excesso de cenas cortadas em cima do personagem o tempo todo. Não sai disso."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,I enjoyed this movie.  Not the best I've seen but not the worse either.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It's looks very very cheap, Dacota just cannot act, Sydney overacting. There was absolutely no action. It's"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Dreadful! Honestly I've never been so bored & unentertained.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"What are they thinking?  complete nonsense.  What happened to the formula that gave us movies like Captain Marvel, Iron Man and Thor?"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,even my dad's death in a car accident it wasn't so terrible than this movie
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Must see one time. But just one time. lol.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Truly awful.  From the horrible edits, style of framing shots, writing, to the nonsensical direction of the story, this movie should have never been released to 4,000 theaters and IMAX screens. We need to renew faith in the fan stop releasing high cost films. This film should have been $15M straight to streaming."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"I watched the movie knowing what the critics were saying but I'm not easy influenced and thank GOD cause it was so good, had so much action and it was genuinely interesting don't be so judgemental about it your gonna love it!"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Oh my God, this thing was boring, terrible and so unprofessional that it feels like Spider-Man Lotus if a big studio made it"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Yikes, guys... A rough waste of time."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,I thought it was really good
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I wouldn't even pay for this movie with the reviews I've seen surrounded by tik tok, I agree and said what Sony is doing with these movies or what they really want to expect from a concept that Not even the protagonist herself knew what this was about, it's rubbish and she won't pay anything to see this horrendous movie So don't waste your time on this, go out with friends or do something with your life."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie is terrible.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Not the best marvel film ever but certainly not as bad as reviews suggest .. go and see your self you.may just like it
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie was a waste rather have watch a video on waste management I can't believe this has any association too Spiderman
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"My favorite part was when Madame Web shot up a bank so she could fund her massive tranq habit, then when the dr*gs gave her superpowers she flew through her neighbor's roof and beat them to death while screaming ""IT'S WEBBIN' TIME!"""
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Another horrible miss!
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It was fine, started a bit messy and ended a bit messy but i enjoyed the middle part of the movie. I did connect with the 3 girls and wish we got to see more of them. It wasn't an amazing movie but i think people should go form their own opinions rather than just hating it because some guy in youtube said it was bad"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"No es mala, lleve a una persona que no tiene nada que ver con marvel y le pareció entretenida, a mi también me pareció entretenida, no obstante no quita que nos vendieron una película súper heroica y la verdad ni los trajes ni relación con el mundo arácnido directa hay,  así que esta por encima del promedio"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Poorly written, terribly edited. The entire movie just didn’t make any sense and at many times was unwatchable. Worst movie in a while. "
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I liked it its a good movie, its interesting not much action but its there."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"It is better than thor 2 , marvels etc. It is a regular movie and not so bad"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Was quite a terrible movie. Sorry but Dakota Johnson’s acting in this movie was horrible. This goes in my bottom 5 worst superhero movies. My 5 worst list is: 5. Fantastic Four with Miles Teller 4. Madame Web 3. Morbius 2. Elektra 1. Catwoman with Halle Berry
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed Madame Web. Forget the critics ratings and go see this movie. Fast paced for an origin story. Great casting. Good soundtrack. One critique: the dialogue is so basic. Better dialogue would have elevated this movie. Enjoy the humor, Easter eggs, and music."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"It's great, they prepared the plot from the start well👌
People who rated it bad only because they expected the ""superhero"" vibe more. Fighting with super power and else."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,It was very entertaining and exciting. I loved how it was a superhero movie without necessarily having the suited super heros.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Could have been more action but Dakota and the rest of the girls were great. Would love to see this world continued.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"People are being too hard on this movie! It was a lot of fun and my family loved it! It was not a 1 star movie, it deserves a higher rating. Yes I understand what they’re saying about the ending being a little cheesy but the rest of the movie is still really good! "
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It was fun, different and enjoyable. People are so quick to trash thing these days.  It's not a blockbuster. But there is depth to the story, fun characters and great pacing.  I enjoyed it."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Another great movie from the Marvel Universe
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Marvel has been on a downward trend since Infinity War. This continues that trend.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,It's not a hero movie. This may be the WORST female superhero movie yet. Cringe. Don't waste your money.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,So many things wrong with this movie. 80 million budget for what??? Save some money and go watch something else.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,I have never walked out of a movie I usually grin and bear it if it's bad I couldn't with this one I had to leave people need to stop killing story lines with their dumb ideas
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I can't put in to words how bad the cast, the direction, the script, or the overall movie was. I've never had this hard of a time describing how bad a movie is. I'll just put it like this, I'd rather watch concrete dry. You get not even a minute of the cast in their respected costumes. I can gratify myself quicker than these characters show up in their costumes. What a waste time and money"
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,More fresh than rotten. It's 5 stars compared with Morbius.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"umm, that was horrible, barely interesting, far from entertaining, i would have left but i liked the popcorn"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I'm speechless at the moment in regards to this movie, it wasn't as promised as the trailers suggested, the villain wasn't a menace at all, it was a total failure, two good things, very creative visual effects and Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney and Isabela Merced were wonderful, also Celeste O Conor was ok so and so, definetly a character redemption needed for Madame Web and Julia Carpenter, not Cornwal as the dialogue suggested, not reccomending to waste money on a movie that was dissapointing from my point of view."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Decirle Terrible le queda corta, publicidad engañosa en toda la maldita película no hay ni una escena de acción a como se muestra en los avances, las escenas si que se muestran pero solo son Flashbacks, los efectos especiales parecen hechos con IA muy cutres, las actuaciones vacías, la directora no hizo nada para que su reparto tuviera la oportunidad de demostrar la calidad de actuación que tienen para ofrecer, da igual quien estuviera en esta película con esta dirección, si buscas ver una película de superhéroes está no es tu película. No vale la pena verla."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Complete and utter rubberish
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,WTF was this horse Dudu Marvel??
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Honestly aweful, like right from the start… the decision that the people making this film boggle the mind. I would love to sit them down and ask them what they were thinking…"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Who the heck was the clueless fool who penned this screenplay
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Truly one of the movies of this time period. I loved the scene where Madame Web looked into the future and started webbing everyone up! The story had writing, that's for sure! 10/10 would watch again"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's not bad.  It's not as good as it could have been. Some ideas were really clunky and didn't work well, it also felt like it was building up to something that never had a payoff.  I love the cast. It's a good popcorn flick to turn your brain off to at the beginning of a weekend.  I much prefer the Sony Marvel properties to what we've been getting from Marvel Studios."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not the worst out this week, but certainly not far from it"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,The worst..this years disaster
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Watching a movie like this makes me scratch my head. You hire  compelling actors, B level production values, Horrible score and  non compelling  direction . Proving actors are only a small part of overall production.  But I guess it comes down to script or lack of a good one .  I hope for the sake of the actors  they will  look back on this and think  how difficult it is to make any film that is entertaining and meaningful. But I guess they gave it the old college try"
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Actually is very good movie ~
All characters are good and beautiful.
Ben is a very responsible and the man can count on.
All three girls are beautiful and nice."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"I actually loved this movie and was pleasantly surprised by it. Very excited about the set up for future movies in the Spider-Man universe. The critics for this movie are being extremely overdramatic about how ""bad"" it is."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Bad writing, lines that wouldn't happen in real life, bad plot, great premise which makes the film more disappointing, bad cinematography."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I need to apologize to the producers of The Marvels. That dog's breakfast looks like an Oscar contender compared to Madame Web. To say it's just another on a long line of superhero movies in which the writers don't like the source material and didn't even bother to read it is an understatement. Which begs the question…why bother making a superhero movie when you hold the source material in contempt? In fairness to the writers, it looks like Dakota Johnson didn't seem to care about the source material or character either. That probably explains why she was mailed in her performance. Seriously, the movie felt like a 2 hour rehearsal. You know a movies bad when the fake reviews written by people raving over a movie they never watched are more entertaining than the movie itself. Yikes!!"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web is a film that has a lot of potential to build an alternate live-action female Spider-verse, but the film itself is too long, there are too many fractures within the story to make it make sense, the character development is minimal at best, and the film's ending and fight scenes leave a lot to be desired. It's a shame because I thought the casting was great and there was some good chemistry between all four female leads. However, the cons outweigh the pros. Now do I want to see a sequel? Yes. Mainly because I want to see how these characters develop in a more grounded story with a more menacing villain and some better action sequences."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,disgustingly bad and horrible
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Sloppy, but not a failure. This is a survival story, not a superhero story. Fun, but not art. Many of the ""plot holes"" online were due to people not paying attention to the movie. Dialogue wasn't terrible but nothing quotable. Humor was good, not great but not bad. Acting was a mixed bag. The biggest fault is the rough cgi. All the problems seem to stem from a lack of faith with the vision of the project. The potential was there but it seems like people lost hope in the process. Could have easily been a 4 out of 5 if the vision was allowed to be finished. Most of the ""cringe"" things people talk about were clearly intentional, not accidental."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,Not your  typical Marvel movie. It lacked the edge of seat excitement
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"God, what was Sony thinking by releasing this movie. So awful, so boring, so cliche
The action part is so little and so bad, the story was meh
The acting is not good too, they use their suit in just under 10 minutes
I don't expect this movie to be this bad, but man way to go Sony"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The story is about Cassandra Web and the movie develops it quite well. It has nothing to do with the other 3 spider girls or the antagonist. I don't understand the hype for seeing other characters that are only the primary motivations of the main character and that serve as a possible introduction to the arachnid world.

As for the costumes, the madam web glasses at the end of the movie... are... I don't know, as if my little nephew had designed and painted them. The costumes of the spider girls and Ezekiel were well done.

The movie is generally very entertaining, nothing to do with what the ""experts"" said... by the way: who are the experts?"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Holy hell! From the very beginning it felt like a very cliche ""super hero"" movie
Like you exactly what was going to Halen before it did,  and who the villian was, down to the shifty eyes
The paramedics didn't know how to paramedic
Cassie pulls her injured co-worker of of a damaged vehicle and doesn't check for vitals, if he's breathing or head injuries
Just pulls him out and starts CPR !!
Later she teaches three teens to do the same thing, no vitals, no check for breathing, doesn't show them where the chest sternem is to get compressions in the right area.
just straight into compressions !!
I was done by the half way mark"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,Don’t let the negativity reviews turn you away. It wasn’t the best movie ever but it was still good. I agree that some dialogue was unnecessary and the bad guy role was not played well but my whole family enjoyed going out to watch it.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"I have no idea what people are complaining about. ""The story is absurd""? Maybe, no more than vast majority of super-hero movies, though. 
At least it is interesting, which cannot be said about most of the recent Disney/Marvel blockbusters. At least this movie doesn't throw at you ridiculously prolonged action sequences in slow motion to make them even longer ;-).
Anyway don't believe reviews and give it a try. It won't change your life but it may entertain you for a bit."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Had bright spots and has the potential to be a good story. Just poorly executed by the actresses, director, writers, and everyone else involved. The Marvels was better"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I just seen it today it was the worst movie I ever seen in my life The movie was was trash. The character are boring The editing was garbage this story was trash I watched it all way through I lost brain cells while watching this movie and they change great power line for dumb reason. I'm done with these Sony Spider-Man movies. This movie barely explains the spider tribe people or that one guy who was in the opening but he appears later and having age and it's false advertisement the Spider-Girls don't get powers but they get powers in the future it was in a dream and at the end of the movie which in the Future Don't advertise your movie Tell us there getting powers for the whole movie what a lie and of course with Sony they killed off the villain. Just like with carnage,Milo, riot, This movie is 0/0 bad movie"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Give me the ""He Was in the Amazon With My Mom When She Was Researching Spiders Right Before She Died"" cut!"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Where to start, this film never seems to have a soul. Character motivations are unmotivated or inspired. Lead actress Dakota Johnson fails to convince that she even wants to be in the film. Pacing makes what is a 2 hour film feel like 4 and when anything comic book film started to happen, it was over. 

It's quite rare that I see a film at the cinema that makes me want to leave, but this film, while not infuriating, is just boring. When films like minus one can be cinematic masterpieces for 15 mil, I have to ask, where did the 80mil for this go."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,This has to be the worst movie I've ever seen.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"It wasn't perfect my any means, but I enjoyed it, Cassie's character development was solid, I will admit I am a little disappointed they made her both blind and disabled at the end of the first film.
Was kinda hoping they'd make a trilogy or something and Movie 1 would be here discovering her powers, movie 2 would have her lose her sight and movie 3 would have her become disabled.

There were also some very cringable moments but what movie isn't these days, over all though really solid movie I would've liked to know more about Ezekiel and his motives like we get why he's after the girls but why did he do what he did at the start of the movie.

The Spider-Man references were kinda cool too, and very well hidden took me two viewing to get the references with Ben Parker, Mary Parker and Mary's Son that was born at the end of the film, who will be named Peter eventually.

So yeah Not perfect but a great movie and in the end very enjoyable."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"The villains voice sounded like evil batman, but aside from that it was fun."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Ashamed to even call this a spider man movie
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Uma história muito boa, um enredo marcante, fiquei com vontade apenas de ver mais a madame web em ação, bem como as meninas também. Deixou um vontade de quero mais."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It's extremely boring. Also an absolutely garbage installation, the scenes jump from one to the other so nothing is clear. Watch this ""great"" movie only with a group of friends."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"I liked the storyline, but would have liked to see more. I think they are setting it up for maybe a Disney series or another movie. All-in-all, I am glad I went to see it. It was a pretty good movie."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,super fun movie if don't have too many expectations. exited to see the characters again!
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I didn't think worse than ""The Marvels"" or "" Morbius"" was possible but my god this is tubi bad."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It wasn't as horrible as people are saying.  They were smart to show the ""future"" scenes.  It did seem more like a CW movie than a Sony movie.   The writing was like a 90's early 2000 comic book writing.  You can enjoy it while reading it, but then you realize how dumb the story really was.   If they are smart, they'll use this as their connection to the multiverse and to all the other Sony movies.  Pull them all in thru the WEB"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Horrible. Boring. Disgusting. No sense.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Sony should sell all the rights to Disney. They know what to do with this stuff.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The bad guy appeared to have a bad voiceover. The acting in general was cringe-worthy. It may be far and away the worst marvel movie I've ever seen. Yes, I'm talking worse than both hulk movies. Yes, even worse than the early 2000s version of Fantastic 4. Why did they do this? I'm still confused."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Very good movie. It tells the emergence of Madame Teia well, of course we can't compare it to the comics, but for a cinema adaptation, the film is great."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Actually has a story, and isn't just a CGI -fest. We enjoyed it."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Wow terrible story, directing, and cast.  What were they thinking?"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Worst character development, worst action scenes(lol its not even action scenes).
Waste of money sony.
sony changed the whole story and here is the worst end product
I am so concerned about venom 3 and kraven"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,nothing ended up happening in the movie. The whole movie was to setup the future of the sony universe but it all got cut from the movie
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Just junk.  One of the worst cinematic wastes of $ ever.  garbage all around with terrible screenwriting.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I actually thought the movie was quite good, from the fun scenes with the girls being teenagers, to when Cassie (madame web) was getting her visions into the future, but there was some downsides to the movie, one being, the ending was disappointing but I think they could redeem it in the sequal. Overall I thought this movie was fun, thrilling and enjoyable"
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Loved it I don't know what all the negative reviews are for
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Horrendous dialogue, no connections between the characters and no action until 1h30 into the film and then still brief. Second day in theatres and only nine people at showing, should of left before it started. 2h I'll never get back."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,train wreck meaningless shall not exist
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Surprisingly entertaining not like the other recent DC or Marvel movies, cast was great.  Hope they do a sequel!"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,The movie was nowhere near as bad as some reviews made it out to be. I would say the ending was rushed and a better job could've been done explaining the aftermath of the final fight sequence.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Entretenida, cómo película de origen está bien"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Too complicated and confusing, and not a good way, save your money."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"The film isn't as dark as people described it, it certainly could have been better, but I really thought this was a funny film, with a really cool action scene, and a feminine energy. It's a good film and I think it's worth watching, you'll definitely have a good laugh with Cassie. She is really cute"
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"A nice switch up from normal superhero films, the last 2 mins of dialogue are a little cringey but overall an enjoyable film."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Okay I might be bias because it's Spider-Man related, but the movie literally wasn't that bad as people are saying. I would say its still more enjoyable then morbius. It's definitely not anything great. But it doesn't deserve the amount of hate it's getting. I see what they were trying to go for. And yes it may not have worked well. But the movie was still watchable and enjoyable. I did notice some weird edits and bad voice lines but other then little tid bits. It's not a bad movie. I will agree that they could have made it way better then what has released. I'm going to give it an 6/10"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A weak cast with weak acting. A villain with no conviction and a voice that sounds to be dubbed over. This spinoff should have never left the studio. How this despicable and lazy story, script ever met the minimum requirements to be green light is beyond me. The costumes look absurd and the we are spider people yet we aren't visuals is awful. The list of disappointments goes on and on. The ending being the most absurd and egregious. This is not worth watching and is actually painful to finish."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Weak in general, wouldn’t even be good for a 2005 film at all."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It is insane to me that these shows and movies continue to be made. These are the same writers that made Morbious, and guess what? It's even worse!!!"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,absolutely abysmal. Its the worse marvel movie to date
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Marvel really disappointed their fans with this movie...well I dint expect much from the movie also I didn't expect I would be so disappointed as this....worst movie ever seen in 2024
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I understand the intention behind the plan here. It aimed to produce a trippy film that envisioned a robust future for the Sony verse. However, the execution fell short. The cinematography employed in this movie made it frustrating to follow, with incessant quick close-up shots of the action. The dialogue was subpar, accompanied by excessive and blatant voice-overs during the villain scenes. Much of the movie's duration felt squandered on dull scenes, leading me to suspect that the screenwriters finished the script only to realise it fell short of the word count. Frankly, the acting quality was lacking across the board, particularly that of the villain, who seemed miscast or hastily chosen. As someone who enjoys guilty pleasures like watching bad movies, this was a truly agonising experience. I cannot recommend it."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Character development overall was a bit off. It felt like a bad episode from a tv show. Action was ok. This was a waste of my time. Marvel dropped the ballalso no post credits!
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Honestly terrible lol Stan Lee would be pissed
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Just poor in som emany ways.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,a decent movie to watch when there's nothing else. not as bad as many fans of comic books are making it out to be. its apart of a multiverse so the story isn't going to be exactly like the comic books.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The villain, who has all the powers that make him strong, including the fact that he can poison a person just by his touch, somehow gets defeated by a billboard falling on him, just more lazy writing. Stay away from this flop."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,The actors were basically reading off the script and the script was cheesy like a bad Disney movie. BUT I was definitely interested to see it since I’m a big spidey fan. The suits were super cool tho. Don’t regret watching it but won’t watch it again.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"I love this movie, it was full of Adventure and surprises and the imagery was amazing!"
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"I went to see the movie without having any expectations and really enjoyed it. It's just the first in the series so you can't expect an epic finale like Endgame and such, but I enjoyed seing Cassie discovering her powers and using her her brain and the elements to overcome a strong enemy."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Slow,  sequences, and very very disappointing performances  . Story line was supper dumb"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I got up and left after 15 minutes, what a boring snorefest."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Good story. Bad everything else
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Movie is actually good. Don't believe in critics review, they just want to let down the marvel movies.

Well defined story and good screenplay and setting a great plot for future movies of Spider-man in the Sony universe. Don't miss it by the wrong critics review."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Bad animations, bad CGI, no posta créditos scene, no connect with NOTHING, bored"
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"A lot of fun if your a Spider fan.  Ignore the critics, go see the movie."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,A great origin story
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,I just feel like everyone involved should have tried harder
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Dakota Johnson decent performance as was all the supporting cast.
Plot and action hold your interest throughout the movie.
Primarily a flic for the teens, but adults won't be disappointed."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Good plot, would have been better placed as a prequel but I still hope there is a second. I'd be excited to go see it"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie should have never been made. Just go watch Morbius, you will have a better time."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,It's not great but it's not bad. The cinematography is interesting and very unique. It has problems but what movie does not. I'd see it again.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Honestly don't understand the bad reviews, the movie was good and the relationship between the three girls was interesting and very realistic. I hope a second part releases soon!"
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie!  I would see this over Oppenheimer or Barbie anytime!  It's fresh and fun, has great shots of NYC & FDNY. Who could ask for anything more?  Plus some fun ideas in the plot. Overall, a good night out at the theatre."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Beginning of movie was an odd rush into origin story. Acting was a bit stale and awkward between actors. Antagonist's voice for some reason came off as being dubbed over (i.e. his mouth movements didn't seemed synced with his voice). Main character's decisions made in the movie were unrealistic despite her position as a civil servant dealing with a crisis. The dancing around numerous instances of characters saying some derivative of Spiderman was a bit annoying after a while. It was better than I thought it was going to be but to be honest, I almost for got this movie had released in theaters."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Honestly I couldn't tell if this was comedy or an action movie. It isn't even bad good it's just bad. How these films are getting the green light is amazing. I need to get a job as a director or screen writer. I have no skills in that realm but I could write something better or direct brainless actors better then who eve did this film.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie is good, I don't know why there are so many people rating it badly.
The ending is really cool btw"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,an hour and 49 minutes i can't take back. this movie SUCKED
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It's okay. It definitely doesn't live up to Marvel's standards. HOWEVER, it's definitely better than the other recent Marvel movies. The CGI at the end of the final battle scene was kinda bad. The excessive moaning made me very uncomfortable. The costume design is bad (the villans outfit was alright). But the story was good in my opinion. The execution was okay. Overall a pretty average movie. 

~4/8 legs"
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie was action filled  & enjoyable with great action. Loved it
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,The costume were trash the some of the camera scenes didn't have the quality it needed the plot didn't hold on tell the end the whole beeging didn't really say what happend it wasn't like regular spider a very worse version of Spiderman and the acting was horrible not a good movie my recommendation DONT WACH
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Overall just not good, the acting and action just didn't feel natural, there were scenes were you could it was a voice over and it was horrible, I like Dakota Johnson as a person and actress but this movie just wasn't good."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Taxing on the brain. Didnt make any sense.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"We went to see Madame web at the drive in near us. I wore shorts and a t shirt because it was unusually warm. That was a mistake. I nearly froze to death , while
My family looked like desperate refugees trying to make heads or tails of this film. One son played with gravel during the movie. My brother spilled beer and Diet Coke on the pavement."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Very weak storyline...disjointed.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Good movie. I enjoyed the story and want to see where they take it.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Glad I got in for free.  If I paid I'd feel really bad.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,The Movie was great the details and multiversal theories are through the roof. The critics can suck it.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Thought it was all around fun movie.  Something different but kept me interested the full time.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie should be an absolute career killer for everyone involved (except Adam Scott who did what he could), but somehow they'll keep on going. The most one-note, surface level characters in a script that seems to have been written in one pass. This movie is not even so-bad-it's-good, it's so-bad-it's-upsetting. I'm telling you, don't see this movie, just read the reviews and piece together what you think the movie is like. You'll end up enjoying that version more than the real thing."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,I liked it because it is a different pov of what a superheroine movie could be like. Looking forward to the next one.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Morbius was worse. Way worse. Though there are major issues with this movie -- inconsistencies, incongruous timelines, questionable special effects, I do not think it deserves all the hate it has received. It follows the typical formulaic superhero pacing and does it well enough. If you're able to look past the flaws, you'll have an okay time if you like super hero movies. Don't blame the formula, blame the ingredients. Not all cakes are good. Some cakes are Paul Hollywood. Some are Martha Stewart.... after she's seen some things in prison. But at the end of the day, cake is cake. If cake came out of a Redbox, that's where I would eat this one."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Unless you want to waste two hours of your life. This might be the most garbage movie ever. I'd rather watch late night infomercials about crockpots.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The most weakest and perhaps wth movie plot and story line I have ever seen!. Why, how, makes no sense, why on earth! Even watching fox news and newsmax are more entertaining then this."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Once again Sony proves why they should just sell the rights to marvel, this movie sucked and nobody wanted it."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie manages to touch on the story between Cassey and her mother. Cassey believes that she went to the Amazon without considering the fact that she was in her womb. Later, she learns a truth she did not expect.
At first, Cassey shies away from emotional involvement because of this unknown truth. It is the awakening of her powers that reunites her with three teenagers who, like her, harbor some resentment. But the responsibility Cassey takes on to save them from death will bind them tightly together.
I think that despite the Marvel stamp, director S.J. Clarkson failed to win over the masses of fans of The Avengers or the multiverses, and maybe that was not her intention. Personally, I'm glad she didn't. 
On the other hand, the superhero costumes worn by Cassey, Julia, Anya, and Mattie were very unattractive. Nothing to do with the outfits of the Avengers heroines, for example.
I liked the performances of the female leads and the actors who played Ezekiel and Ben.
Thank you S.J. Clarkson and all the actresses, actors and crew in general."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Nobody wanted this. Horrible ! Shame on you for creating this.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,great movie - it’s definitely a “story origination”
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Probably one of the most boring superhero films ive every watched. I cant even recommend it to a certain audience.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,It's time for SONY to just give all rights to Marvel and let Marvel do the movies right given that SONY just can't.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,I was expecting it to be awful from the reviews but it wasnt bad at all.   Ive definitely seen way worse marvel movies than this one.  Not sure why its getting so much hate.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Garbage movie and another flop for Sony's attempt to do anything with the Spider-Man franchise. I am baffled how Sony is not embarrassed by this dump of a movie.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Another great superhero movie from Sony and Columbia. A good time travel movie.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The storyline had potential, however, the execution came across like a CW series."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I caught ""Madam Web"" today, and it's safe to say it plunges below the already low expectations set by the online chatter. This film manages to be an exemplary showcase of how not to execute superhero cinema, with dialogue so cringeworthy, it makes ""It's webbing time"" sound almost Shakespearean by comparison. Imagine the worst aspects of a CW superhero show, devoid of the charm that made early ""Smallville"" a hit, and you're close to experiencing ""Madam Web."" In all honesty, this movie is a tangled mess that I strongly recommend skipping. It fails to weave any of the magic it so desperately reaches for, leaving us with a web we'd rather not get caught in."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie nothing like spider man me and my son can't wait and hope they make a part 2
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Well I know what I'm buying. Next time I watch this movie I'll be wearing my ""I eat math for breakfast"" T-shirt. This film was an elusive masterpiece that pushed every boundary known to man. The amount of joy I felt while watching motivated me to ignore every plot hole. This movie exemplified the theme of ""girl boss"" showing that they can run from anything. To end this, I have to mention how they featured professor xavier in this! The multiverse really is real!! In the end she became a mom to three girls 5 years younger than her, ""Us strays need to stick together."""
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Everything about this movie sucked! I felt like they really casted anybody for this movie. By far the worst superhero movie of all time
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Best Picture 2024, said no one ever"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,Not nearly as bad as the critic rating would have you believe. It was perfectly enjoyable but definitely not amazing. If you want to go to the movies just because you like going to the movies then this is a good choice but I wouldn't recommend you go out of your way. Acting and dialogue was cheesy fairly often but never atrocious aside from everything the villain says.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,This shouldn't have ever came out
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Act impact from beginning to end seems to be origin  story. Cant wait for the next one to come out.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Best movie ever made.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie couldn't quite figure out what it was. An origin story? A team up? A mystery? The leads certainly tried their best with the script they had. I liked the main cast, they were just lacking a cohesive story to be in. Overall this movie was about allowing a future movie that I would have rather seen."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I feel sorry for Dakota participating in this stupid and ridiculous movie. I have been a long time fan of the Spidey universe. I know pretty much a lot of the characters background and story. Anyway, the plot is nefarious, the dialogues, sequences, the story makes no sense. I was going to go on and on but I better stop here. I love Dakota Johnson, she is quite an actress and I am pretty sure she could get into more important movies or be part of the superhero movies….but not while Sony is in control and has the rights to ""destroy"", yes destroy the Spidey Universe."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"It wasn't that bad of a movie. It was a little bit of a change from the normal superhero movies. Dakota Johnson is no Academy award winner, but she did OK."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I liked it, it's a bummer how it doesn't actually connect to MCU... also it started interesting but went a bit flat towards the end. I heard a theory how it was supposed to be a prequel to Spider-man where the whole movie is about them protecting Peter's mom and making sure Peter's born but that was, for some reason, scrapped. Overall, better than the reviews would lead you to believe."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Mediocre story line. 

Acting great

Picture and song also great"
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"It's a good movie, it is not the worst for me, I just wanted more scenes with the spider suits, but it worked as a prequel and let us know how Cassie got her powers and how spiderwomen got theirs."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Honestly it was funny!
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This was one of the worst movies I have seen since Howard the Duck.  It was all over the place, the pacing was weird, the character development was bizarre, and the details were awful.  Even if you have no idea what a paramedic does, you will know that these two are the absolute worst medics and should never be allowed on an ambulance.  

So many incongruities and forced motivations. Why were the three girls in costume and why did they have powers in his nightmare, but not really, just kidding.   Campfire left burning in the woods?  No problem, and how did they start the fire to begin with?  Paramedic's wife is in labor, time to go into panic mode. What??  She ""teaches"" them CPR?  Barely, so cringe.  Medic bag has flares and smoke grenades?  Of course it would.  How did the bad guy find them at the warehouse?  

I swear the villain was voice-dubbed.  It was super annoying to watch his lips move, but the words didn't match.  

So, so dumb.  Don't waste your hard earned dollars."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This superhero movie was alright. Dakota Johnson, Celeste O'Connor, Isabela Merced, Sydney Sweeney, Tahar Rahim, Adam Scott, and the rest of the cast did a decent job in this movie. The plot of the movie was kind of dramatic and a little intense. In my opinion, the director should've done a better job on making this movie. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you might enjoy it, but it won't be spectacular."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,Another origin story.. wasn't too bad tho expected a little more.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst movies I’ve seen in the last 5 years. I fell asleep it was that bad. Acting was terrible. Save your money, I’m not even a hard critic of movies. This was bad"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"mid.

Not bad, not great. fake crying was funny. Overall story was entertaining. I give it a B-."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Easily one of the worst movies ever made. Characters act hopeless and powerless for no other reason than to make Dakota seem like she's able to actually do something of use. Sony must really hate their actors and staff for allowing this movie to be released.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie was really good. How dare you guys rate it a 3
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,I feel sorry for the actors in this movie
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It’s a comic book film that wasn’t as bad as people maybe made it out to be, I think it just lacks structure but acting was fine, the villain is the problem just not really detailed like it needed to be"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"En algunos momentos me parece divertido tanto como aburrido, mucho palabreo y algunas malas actuaciones, en especifico la mamá de Cassi Web"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,I loved the action and the story! I can’t wait to see it again with the grandkids!
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Almost didn't see the it because of all the poor reviews. Had to see what they were talking about and they are absolutely wrong! It was a good movie, I recommend it. It's an origin story the audience gets to take a ride on with discovery. With enough action, mystery, adrenaline rush. Plenty of entertainment with the characters. This Madam Web movie is made up to expect a part two to see her in her full force. I can't wait for part two! It's a must to completely see how powerful she is as a superhero. The issue with everybody is They were expecting everything in one film as Marvel usually does."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"ehm............................. did i actually use my last 10 dollars on this shitty movie wtf man, now my mom gotta drive me to work, 0.5/10"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Biggest garbage ever
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"My mom died, while she was researching this movie in the theatres."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"I think this was a very good movie. Perhaps nothing revolutionary, but just a solid overall superhero movie. And that's what it is, a superhero movie. I honestly don't know why people are giving it such a hard time. Yeah, it is not particuarly complex, but neither was John Wick, or Fast and Furious. It is just a fun, enjoyable movie. Nothing that will set the world on fire, but a very good movie all the same."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,The movie was so bland and generic that it honestly sounded like it was written by a 5 year old. Don't even get me started on the horrible voice on the villain that sounds like a five year old playing with action figures.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Bad and just sad. Just feel sorry for the future people who will see that movie
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Watched Madam Web and glad I didn't pay attention to the reviews. The movie was entertaining and caught my interest.  I really hope there is a sequel so I can see future character developments. Honestly, I liked this movie 10 times better than Mean girls. Strongly recommend just watch a movie that interests you and do not let the media dissuade your decision to just have fun."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The story is a good idea but falls short, I watched this movie with low expectations and was happy with the end result, obviously this is not the conventional hero movie and I applaud that, I think the cast was fine the script is probably the weakest point of the movie."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,I didn't think super hero movies could get worse but this is proving that each  film reaches a new low. This movie is pure trash and is not worth the time and materials it took to make it . The acting is forced and fake the story is idiotic the filming would have gotten a D - in film school. So here's a PSA save your money and go watch paint drying it will be more satisfying entertainment.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"After sleeping on it. This movies was so bad I decided to write a short story depicting what should have happened in this movie. This movie had a couple of good scenes, well only the subway scene, and the rest was garbage. Yeow."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Have you ever graded your arm against the highway at 65 miles per hour? No? Well, let me tell ya, this movie is fucking awful. I genuinely felt pain while watching this movie. There was no redeeming quality. Did you say web?"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"so bad, not well written at all! i would make that the worst movie i have ever seen. ever."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Horrible, a new torrure method would be forcing someone to watch this alone with nothing to distract themselves."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie was surprisingly better than what I was expected. No where as bad as the reviews have made it seem.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,I just can't with this…….
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Wasn't my jam, lots of issue, I hated the flash cuts that happen a lot."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The set production was very poor. Everything felt like a stage or felt fake. It seemed more like a play.  I dont kniw if it was poor writing, acting, casting,  script or set.. but it failed."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,Not bad as a Spider-Man spinoff most of fans didn't like it because they were expecting a cameo for tobey or andrew or even tom but the movie focused on madame web and in the ending i think we now got a doctor strange in the Sony Spider-Man Universe
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"If I could give 0 stars I would. Ooff this was bad, so bad in all areas. The voice of the villain was out of sync. The editing was shoddy. The dialogues didn't sync. And that ending was atrocious! This movie will go down as the worst super hero movie ever made. Yes, even worse than green lantern! Please, DO NOT WATCH this movie."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,No morbious but it's alright
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"I haven't read other reviews but I've seen the scores and honestly I have no idea what movie they watched. It was a popcorn film. Similar to die hard in pacing. Slow in the beginning but then it turns out every little thing in the beginning was relevant just as the action kicks in. Is this an art house movie that will change your life? No. But to be honest, there is plenty here to make you enjoy 2 hours. I may even want to see it again once it comes to blu-ray. It was made even more special that I brought my son to it and he turned to me to say ""this movie is so good"" right before the act 2 climax with a large smile on his face after a tough week at school. He will be telling his friends about how good it is, and I wanted to share it with the internet."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,The dialogue was bad. The ending was convoluted mess.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,I always thought the worst/cheesiest super hero movie was the 2011 Ryan Reynolds Green Lantern movie. Until today.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Suspenseful and great actor/actress support. The very ending scene made it a little cheesy
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Disney (and in this case Sony) ruins everything.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"A recent article in Hollywood Reporter by Richard Newby bemoans the pathetic state of film criticism today, noting the propensity for gleeful takedowns often predicated on false information and/or intentional mischaracterizations. That article offers a really excellent analysis of one of the major problems with so much of film criticism, including what is often found here.

I just got home from seeing Madame Web in the theater. It's not a great movie, but it is not a terrible movie either. The critics attacks were an exercise in one-upmanship as to who could offer the most excoriating one-liners. The irony is that this was NOT a superhero movie. It was an origin story with several intriguing premises—somewhat derivative as they nearly always are—and yet interesting. Did it have plot holes and jumps in logic? Absolutely. Nearly every superhero story does.

With so much of episodic TV these days, I find myself feeling that so many of these six and a half hour, 8-episode mini-series or story arcs, could have been a really good two hour movie, or perhaps a three hour, two-part series. Ironically, I felt the opposite about this movie. We actually could have used more of what we got. The characters and their situations were introduced in a few 30-second scenes and a few 20-second autobiographical confessions. In this case, we might have used a fifteen or twenty minute exploration of the backstories of each of the six (or seven) main characters, like you would get in a good three-part series; not three, two and a half hour movies, but three, hour long episodes. Clearly, it has obvious Spiderman parallels, but it introduced some interesting premises on its own.

It was a little like Bumblebee in the Transformer world. That is, it reduced the slam-bang factor by ten, but it worked on the human level, even humanizing the ""car,"" to a much more compelling significance than any of the other movies in the Transformer series. Madame Web was certainly not as strong an entry as Bumblebee, but as a 2-hour diversion it was a perfectly pleasant way to spend time in the movie theater."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web is a cinematic disaster, marred by a confusing plot, lifeless characters, and subpar visuals. Save yourself the agony – this film is best left unwatched."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,It was an interesting movie was very cliche and the line delivery wasn't the best and the editing was choppy but overall it's an average film that you would expect from the 2000s
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Movie is awful. Sony Marvel should stop putting out movie as it hurts the overall Spider-Man brand.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Honestly this movie is getting way too much hate. There were obvious flaws throughout the film but when given a chance, it's actually quite entertaining!"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame web es una película, con actores , con actuaciones, con un soundtrack,con una historia y con efectos especiales...
Solo faltan que sean buenos"
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,I understand why everyone is hating it but it isn't terrible it is worth watching Dakota and Sydney are amazing it in!!!
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Overall I enjoyed this movie. Yes, there were some places that could've been reworked, but I had a good time and loved the actors. Dakota Johnson is coming into her own."
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie was really good. I loved it!
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie was so story line was just terrible after the first trailer came out I knew it would just bomb
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,a boring horror movie that is marketed as a superhero movie
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Not as jumpy and action driven as the typical Marvel superhero movie. As always, gaps in the plot but which movie doesn't?? I enjoyed it and will watch again when it goes online. Be forewarned, there is NO cut scene. I never read the comics so I'm not sure what the three girls will become. AS I said, I enjoyed it :)"
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Unique story interesting throughout.
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"I personally really enjoyed this movie so much, i really hoped for more suits screentime but we could get it in a sequel, honestly i love the cast specially Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O'Connor and Isabela Merced, the plot is pretty simple but functional, a possible Madame Web 2 could finally find the live action sony- spider-verse. To finish with i don't care about what people could say about my opinion because my opinion is mine and only mine thank you very much."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Written and directed by a child.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Such a great concept, but the dark cloud of the sony verse is all over it. Nothing to look to before or after."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Pile of shite, why make these films if they aren't going to make them right"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Can I give is zero? what the hell did I just watch, the world has gone mad..."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,How can they keep making worst and worst heroes movies?
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,It wasn't even a film to pass the time I nearly fell asleep a few times costumes were only part of one scene and it was messy with so many plot holes and inconsistencies that you just never get into the movie and they couldn't even get the line with great power comes great responsibility and went with an altered one which dulls the meaning of the line completely.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,So bad it is laughable. 
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"I thought it was fantastic, I highly recommend it. I thought it was funny & emotional all at the right times. The casting was perfect & overall a good watch."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Just terrible. Can't get much worse
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this movie it's getting a lot of unnecessary hate i think people expect too much and compare everything yo the disney marvel when their 2 separate things.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Alf decía que cuando no tienes nada bueno que decir de algo
No digas nada"
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,I loved it! This is a great origin story!
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Accept the fact that there are some Super Heroes, or Super Heroines if you will, that may be perceived as super only in the minds of their creators and the Production Companies who would like to at least cover their costs of production. Madame Webb is intended to be an origin story for a female superhero who has the cognitive ability of portending the ""what is to come"". It is difficult to review a plot that is uninspiring, challenges any and all aspects of realistic possibilities and is an ordeal to sit through. A female scientist is in the Amazon searching for a mythical spider whose venom's curative possibilities are purported to have almost miraculous healing properties. She is pregnant with a fetus diagnosed as suffering from a critical disease that only the venom from this mythical Amazonian spider might cure. The mother is shot by a guide who is also searching for these same mythical spiders for his own financial gain. Quicky attempting to advance a story line that does not deserve the consideration, the child is delivered in an Amazonian River where first the mother dies and next some magical/mystical energy flows through the newborn instilling her with the ability to portend future actions and activities. With a serious effort to push the illogical story line to its ultimate conclusion, Spider Lady, Dakota Johnson, will meet and align herself with 3 youthful super wanna bees and they will become part of her future cadre of crime fighting spiderites. With either a dramatic rewrite of the entire concept or immediate recognition of the shallowness of the Female Super Spider Venom ladies lack of screen value, this should be the last Web Lady episode that will ever be made.
Rating: A - T - C - A = A Termination Contract Anticipated"
"Feb 17, 2024",POSITIVE,Movies actually really good don't believe the critics love anything Spiderman madam web was a good adaption to the comics.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Story was predictable and preposterous at same time.  Script wasn't consistent and jumped around.  I wanted to leave but was with friends.
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This movie wasn't nearly as bad as the professional reviewers give it. I think there's a bias against Sony Spiderverse Movies. It was better than either of the Venom movies and Morbius.

The acting was good all the way around. Which should be the case cause you hsve some solid veterans and some talented up and comers. Script was fine. The villain was a bit disfocused though.

It's a pretty good origin story. I would like to see more of these heros as they evolve. But unfortunately, we probably won't get the chance."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Ive never seen a marvel movie this horrendous
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It was pretty good, glad I went to see for myself."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Horrible adaptation that I truly regret seeing.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Definitely something different from Marvel. Not sure how it will fit into the Cinematic Universe.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Oh no... It's Morbin' time again.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,It’s not much compared to past Spider-Man movies just gave me a reason to be in a 4DX theater.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,It was good for exposition. Don’t watch the movie to explain the Spiderverse.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"In essence, Madame Web is a mediocre film with an enjoyable story that is squandered due to its short duration and poor direction. While the main characters are sufficient to carry the film, unfortunately, their adversaries pale in comparison. The weakness of the antagonist automatically weakens the film. However, beyond everything else, the biggest problem with the project is entrusting it to a TV director, S.J. Clarkson. Despite having a highly skilled cinematographer like Mauro Fiore behind it, the decision-making process fell short in the hands of the director. Rather than being potentially much better, it ended up resembling a simple and cheap action series from the early 2000s."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie had terrible acting from almost every actor/actress at some point in the movie. Everything about this movie was atrocious most likely due to the writing. It was over edited and didnt even feel like a superhero movie or even a Marvel movie at that. PLEASE do better or don't even bother releasing the movie!
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's a fun movie, it could've been better with a better story, but it does the job for a fun movie."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,The same tired formula Disney has done OVER and OVER again. How much money does Disney need to lose until they realize WE DONT WANT THIS?!
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"An illogical situation that unfolds in an obvious way, with poorer dialogue than the naughty connections with Spider-Man. 
The production focuses on a kind of cat and mouse game in which, on one side, there is a poorly developed villain and, on the other, there is a group of people reduced to archetypes by a script that seems to not know what to do with them ."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"#MovieReview #MadameWebb 

So the movie is a origin story, we knew that from the commercials, plus she's new to the Sony marvel associated project 

The film wasn't as bad as the critics are putting it out to be, it was just a bland and boring story. It wasn't any kind of buildup or lead into anything more than what you got in the commercials or the trailers. 

She's pretty much a boring superhero, who gives you the vibe of professor X, without any credible fighting style. It was sad to see the three actresses basically just be a running gag, they were just three little girls trying to keep from being killed.

The crazy thing is that all three of the actresses are actual actresses that have had legitimate roles, Chelsea is Lucky from the Ghostbuster franchise, Isabella is from the transformers franchise, and Sweeney is from the blockbuster hit in theaters currently anyone but you 

And of course, Madame Webb Dakota Johnson is from the Fifty Shades of Grey franchise 

So together, this looks like an A+ outstanding phenomenal over the top successful combination, but it is not, it did not make me want more. It did not make me want to see this movie again, because it was just boring. I think overall the film had a lot of potential if it would've been written better, it could have actually done something 

But it was almost 2 hours of straight dialogue flashbacks back-and-forth is this gonna work or not gonna work. And then you're just like I'm over it when it over. And do not wait. There are no end credit scenes"
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Better than everybody said
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"It doesn't deserve 5 stars, but it also doesn't deserve 13%… so I will give it 5 stars to up the rating… even it out."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,Madame Web is an enjoyable & good movie despite the tiniest flaws it has but other than that I enjoyed it very much.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,The worst movie I've ever seen by a landslide. Congrats to everyone involved for not caring even a single bit about the final result. Love
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,Fui sin ninguna expectativa y no mala tiene sus momento pero la sentí un poco apurada y falto un poco más de guión.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,It was a good movie 8/10 I think it told the story well and had a lot of interesting scenes. Some cringy moments but with the dialogue otherwise great 👍
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"You ever wonder what it's like to shove razors in your eyes?,Look no further. Not even Spider-Man could save this movie. Best way to watch is with the projector turned off."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"My daughter and I loved it, looking forward to the next one in the series"
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"It really caught me, it has a lot of Easter eggs, I really liked it"
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Was surprised by this movie. Alot better than what I expected and good character development.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I came into this being optimistic because I heard it was bad, man were they right. The plot is all over the place, there are many inconsistencies that go unaddressed, the dialogue is abysmal and don't even get me started on the delayed poorly dubbed voiceovers from the villain character. They spend a lot of time trying to force the fact that you're  in the year ""2003"" while the characters and technology tell me they are far into the 2020s. There was no care or thought put into this movie and any idea anyone had I'm sure they approved on the spot. Oh and let's not even mention the fact that the 3 girls never get any powers and aren't in their costumes for more than 2 minutes total. Very bad, you should all be ashamed."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"A fun movie, felt like a brief introduction with more to come."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,I thought it's going to be a bad movie. I was wrong.I hope they make a part 2. With more action.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Madame Web starts off weak with its pacing but comes back strong and resolves some of its major issues. This film still has its occasional struggles with CGI but what super hero movie doesn't have that. There are some corny lines and some really interesting acting choices, but with this being said, the movie is not that bad. This movie comes back strong after some of its struggles and creates a fun and interesting story with a nice premise to the introduction of Madame Web and the beginning of a possible live-action spiderverse film series. This is not a spider-man film, there is not action in the sense like a spider-man film so please do not come into this thinking their is going to be intense action, but the action that is there, works well for this movie."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,This has got to be worst film of the year. And we already at the start of the year we're only in February. but hey that is where Hollywood puts the worst films of the years that they want to get out of the way.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"awesome, incredible,and best storyline"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,I didn’t think it was as awful as others did. I thought the girl power comradery was better than the forced one in Avengers Endgame (trust me I don’t mean the movie was as good). Dakota Johnson was very good in it. I did expect to see more of the supporting cast as the superheroes they would become but I guess this was intended to be a setup movie. 3 1/2 stars feels right to me.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I'm positive Tahar Adim's lines were all done via ADR. Very disappointed with the film, the cast is wasted with a muddled script."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,I just don't understand why they made it the way they did. Feels like a 90's comic book attempt but with a cringey story. It's absolutely meaningless and has no reason to exist in the Marvel universe. Sony needs to give it up in general.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Very juvenile.. bad plot, bad acting. I didn't  lose any brain cells trying to figure out or follow the plot. Teenagers will like this."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,Esperaba más desarrollo de personajes.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It was boring, there are good moments but none memorable."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Storyline and character development was so rushed, didn't blow my mind. It's a shame especially coming from Marvel as producers."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Just when I think Hollywood can't get any lower they go and totally blow me away. If I could give negative stars I would. You have to listen to Dakota's interviews for this film to truly understand that no one here has any idea how to make a super hero movie. She literally said she would do ""anything' to play a role after stating she has never watched even a Marvel movie. The director and writers have produced garbage and I can't believe they keep getting paid to do this. Please go on strike again. We were much happier."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Couldn't stand this movie, absolutely terrible from start to when I left. Didn't even watch the whole movie. The writing was terrible, the CGI was dreadful. This isn't even laughable bad, this was shocking and shouldn't be aloud to be called a film."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Nonsensical plot, pointless Spider-Man references which are never paid off, that awful afro, terrible writing, naf SFX....why did we need this???"
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,truly one of the movies of all time madame web is a true masterpiece dethrones morbius as one of the worst Sony verse films of all time 10/10
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"An average flick.  Not great, but watchable."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Weak in most regards, the best part was Ben & Cassie's conversations which added some dry wit to an otherwise dry, boring and unexciting movie.  The plot wasn't interesting as it went through its tired backstory and moral sections, the villain was dull and didn't exude any menace and most of the dialogue was awkward and delivered poorly.  The action scenes and special effects looked cheap, the costumes at the end looked ridiculous and overall, it lacked any charm or thrills."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Pior filme que eu já vi no cinema.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"How did this movie get made? It's so bad. It's not even like funny bad, just bad bad."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst Marvel movies ever. So many plot holes and why to much foreshadowing with all the ""web""like things. Really don't know, where marvel what's to go with all of this."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"What a waste of my 2 hrs. Indeed Rotten!! Poor execution, poor dialogues, extremely poorly excecuted ""action  & story. I realkt dont recommend this movie and should be voted as the worst Marvel/sony movie of all time. If someone really wanted to have a super hero movie; this was not it!."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It Madame Webbing time
To flop
Hard"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Película totalmente horrible con personajes insufribles, villano x y efectos horribles."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It was different, not the classic superheroe movie. There was no need to invest a lot money. Maybe it was not the best but you didnt spend an amount similar to Ant Man 3."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Marvel Movies these days are such a bore and have completely lost their charm.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"I was pleasantly surprised. I knew the reception was a mixed bag, but oh my, I felt so much nostalgia watching this. It was the older style of superhero movies, similar to first Spider-Man versions - without big bad wanting to rule the world, without fights blown out of proportions and without unrealistic hyper powers that makes characters boring. And I liked all female characters - very relatable and likable."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Different and it was good
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"ummmmmm, dons daughter is vapid but still somewhat pretty and sydney is uglified so she's not prettier than dons daughter. dumb story, bad acting, too long and what is this anyway. the spiderman madame web was an old lady? run away, don't spend any of your money watching this."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. The films general look looked like it was filmed as a TV series spliced into a movie. Most of the scenes didn't make sense i.e. 'I am going to train you to harness your powers, then cuts back to queens and suddenly is an expert in powers'. Acting and choices of actors/ actresses were terrible. The spider verse is ruined and Sony need to sell all the rights of their Marvel to Disney. Please stop making shoddy Associated Marvel films. Again. Do not waste your time seeing this film."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"What fuck this? Please sony, no... no... This it's don't real!"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"STAN LEE WOULD BE ASHAMED
DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT GO SEE THIS FILM . HANDS DOWN THE WORST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE . SONY PLEASE SELL  THE RIGHTS TO DISNEY MARVEL . OR LET ME BLIPPED BACK TO YESTERDAY AND HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely ABYSMAL movie. CW quality acting combined with a nonsensical script, horrific writing and mailed in acting performances. I have NEVER given a movie a half star but this movie deserved none. It was sloppy and thrown together and made EXCLUSIVELY for teenage girls with no thought whatsoever for the comic book fans."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Crapfest that is Madame Web!
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,What the f* was that?
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I'll keep this as spoiler free as I could but I will say, it is a bad film, but is it the worst superhero film of all time?
I mean, this one is your average bad, like say Thor: Dark World bad.
A couple of the scenes does feel like an actual Madame Web movie while the rest feels more of a Terminator or even a Final Destination movie as a whole.
The performance were actually not bad, except for the villain who does it way too hard as the setting goes, especially when the central characters should've been both Cassie and Ezekiel.
The rest were more add-in's as I can say.
Actually, I remember seeing an interview about a script before it was scrapped and they made a new one.
In all honestly, I can only feel sorry for the director and the performers as they did point out before this movies release.
4/10."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This the most horrible superhero movie I have ever seen.This is a disgrace to Spiderman.The dialogue is awful cgi is horrible and is extremely boring.how can you call this a superhero movie with no super powers or fight scenes?Not a single one of the fight the main villain , they don't even throw a punch.The suits that you seen in the all the marketing are barely shown in the last 2 min of the movie.Everyone who saw this and thought this was a good should be ashamed.Why are there so many references to Spiderman/peter if they won't use him in the future?Sony why are you scared to make your characters say the name ""Peter""? This is horrible I would give this film a zero if I could."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Not the worst movie of all time, but could’ve been better. Wonder what the future is for it"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,I was unable to go watch the film due to being sick and couldn’t receive any type of refund.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Expected better, story dragged a bit and the cast was just boring."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame web achieved the impossible, being worse than catwoman and fantastic four 2015"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,I would have had a better time setting my money on fire.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,At 26 I have finally checked out of all Marvel and Star Wars movies. Sad.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Que filme ruim!!!A trama é ruim,os personagens não são cativantes, HORRÍVEL!!!"
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"i liked it, pretty understandable plot. fun to watch."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I was expecting some top tier so bad it's good hate watching but this movie was just bad. I love Sydney Sweeney, Emma Roberts and Adam Scott and I am excited for Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connors future projects, I've only seen Dakota Johnson in the Social Network but my friends say she's a good actress, despite all this they're all awful in this movie and they are not helped by the script, costuming, lighting, directing or score/sound design"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"É um dos piores filmes que eu já tive o desprazer de assistir, chato e cansativo do início ao fim.
Não tem nada, absolutamente nada que se salve porque esse filme falha até como entretenimento."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,This is not a spider man environment ... this is not comics super heroes movie ... do not go to theaters ... get from internet and watch at home !
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Ouch, that average rating! I'm not going to lie though, I genuinely had a fun time watching 'Madame Web'... perhaps I should be keeping that fact quiet?

I don't know what to say, I found it to be suitably entertaining. I'm sure there are plot holes aplenty (I noticed a few) and it probably makes zero sense/isn't a good adaptation compared to its source material or whatever but honesty... I don't care, it gave me enough enjoyment that I wasn't questioning anything about what I was watching.

The cast are probably the key factors as to why I did enjoy this. I previously knew of Dakota Johnson but hadn't actually seen her in anything properly, I found her performance to be more than noteworthy and she spearheads the film strongly. The trio of Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor are positives too.

Tahar Rahim's antagonist, meanwhile, is poorly written and portrayed, though I personally thought the actor did a good job. I have no complaints with anyone who appears onscreen to be honest. Away from them, the pacing and score are also standouts.

In my recollection of viewing this, I truthfully haven't got any issues with it. If it wasn't for the slight bad murmurs that I did hear about pre-watch (though not much of it as I avoid as much as I can with movies) and the reaction on sites like this post-watch, I'd not be questioning my thoughts about this whatsoever.

As I always say, to each their own. For me, gimme a sequel (as long as the cast remain, mind). Not even sorry."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Good movie in general, good performances by the 4 protagonists, interesting plot, good origin movie of Madame Web, I liked that they linked this movie with the birth of Peter Parker"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,This is almost so bad that it's good level but it's not it's just bad! I feel sorry for Dakota Johnson who I really like .. literally the reason she had FIRED HER AGENT is the embarrassment of being in this movie!! It's a thing.. you can google it
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,KINDLY SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"As a long-time fan of superhero movies, I was genuinely excited to see ""Madame Web"" hit the big screen. However, after enduring what felt like an eternity in the theater, I left feeling utterly let down and unsatisfied.

Where do I even begin with this cinematic disaster? Let's start with the plot—or lack thereof. It's as if the writers threw together a mishmash of random ideas and hoped for the best. There's no coherent storyline to follow, leaving audiences scratching their heads in confusion rather than being engaged in the narrative.

And don't even get me started on the character development, or lack thereof. Madame Web herself is a one-dimensional bore, lacking any depth or complexity. Instead of a strong, compelling protagonist, we're left with a cardboard cutout who fails to elicit any emotional investment from the audience.

The dialogue is equally cringe-worthy, filled with clichés and uninspired exchanges that had me rolling my eyes in disbelief. It's almost as if the script was written by a middle schooler attempting their first fan fiction, rather than seasoned professionals tasked with bringing a beloved character to life.

But perhaps the most unforgivable sin of ""Madame Web"" is its utter disregard for continuity and respect for the source material. Die-hard fans of the comics will be left fuming at the liberties taken with the story and characters, with key elements either altered beyond recognition or simply ignored altogether.

To add insult to injury, the film's special effects are laughably bad, reminiscent of something you'd see in a low-budget made-for-TV movie from the '90s. It's clear that no expense was spared in cutting corners, resulting in a visual experience that fails to impress on any level.

In conclusion, ""Madame Web"" is a colossal failure in every sense of the word. Save your time and money and steer clear of this cinematic train wreck. It's a shameless cash grab that does a disservice to both its source material and its audience. Consider yourself warned."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Do the critics get paid to give crappie reviews. The film is not the best marvel film I have seen, and it is not typical, however I really enjoyed the film. Go make your own mind up  and go and see the film."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,My expectations were pretty low and it met them.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Worst marvel movie out there. Previews were better than the actual movie. I recommend not to waste your money seeing this movie.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Again…woke…when is Hollywood going to WAKE UP!!! Horrible
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Only reason I paid to see this was so I could verify myself how bad it was. I mean in the movie 
they only showed about 3 minutes of screen time of the chracters in suit, what kind of super hero movie does that?! The only reason Morbius was SLIGHTLY better is because they had some decent easter eggs. Sony just needs to stop expanding the spider man universe without spider man. Sad to see how far ""Marvel"" movies have fallen since endgame. My final saying will be that this is the final nail in the coffin for Sony's Marvel universe, I'm not wasting my money to go see Kraven."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,Much better than anticipated. Well paced and credible performances.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was one of my least favorite films in a very long time. I actually considered leaving before the movie finished.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Terrible. Bad dialogue, writing, editing and references. It is laughably bad and somehow worse than Morbius. How do they manage to make these movies worse and worse. An overall disaster."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The edting, pacing, and cinematography are atrocious. This is completely incoherent at certain points and alternates between boredom adn convuluted scenes that make no sense. The acting is terrible filled with clunky dialouge, generic side characters that all blend in together, a subpar villian, and Dakota Johnson half the time acting like she could care less. The music is ok I guess though. The Pepsi fight at the end is so bad it should've been a Super Bowl commerical. And it can't be stated enough how truly unfollowable this gets. the story straight up doesn't make sense at certain times. The CGI is atrocious, the Uncle Ben age is so weird and bizarre you could spend hours trying to figure that out. The ambulance scene is unintentionally hilarious. This is edited at points like it's trying to be a psychological horror movie from the 00's and boy does it succeed in terms of quality. Skip This completely. This is truly one of the worst Superhero movies ever made. It really is THAT bad."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I was a model foster kid. I peed outside and everything

 - actual line reading from Madame Web. Every creative decision was incorrect, it's honestly incredible how this tire fire unfolded"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Just when you thought that the DEI / Wokies couldn't go any lower....    If a spider crawled up the bung hole of She-Hulk and then was sharted out at the speed of sound against a brick wall, now that would be a proper representation of ""Madame Web""."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the movie I had never heard of this character before
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Actually the worst super hero movie in recent memory. The writing was some of the worst I've seen, and did not make any sense throughout all 2 hours of horrible acting by everyone involved. Not once was I able to even act like the movie interested me. The script felt like it was written by 4 people who did not share what the other had written until the last day of shooting. 
Horrendous."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,So good.  Unexpected.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,The room was better.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"There are no words to describe how awful this movie was. The story line made no sense whatsoever. The action was dumb and senseless.  It got to the point where it was obvious that Dakota Johnson and Sydney Sweeney knew it's a bad movie during filming and they just give up. Half the time they just read their lines without any emotion whatsoever.   I will be the one to say it,  I actually liked Morbius better than this and that's not saying much at all."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely horrible dialog, so many plot holes and cardboard acting"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Once again marvel really did die after endgame. This movie is exactly what's wrong with Hollywood.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Awesome fun movie. Don't listen to critics
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,I want to rate zero but I can't.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,It's a great beginning movie.  Girls sticking together and fighting for themselves.   Must see
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Is this supposed to be a movie?
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"At no point was this movie even remotely entertaining, not even for this nerd who loves deep cut comic book lore (there is none, unless you count Cassandras cringe worthy glassware at the end). I can even get past the terrible writing, if the action was good, but Madame Web is incredibly boring. Anything interesting in the trailer flashes by in an instant when watching the full film. The finale is very choppy, and the only payoff is seeing Cassandra blind in a wheelchair (Which, to be fair, is actually comic book accurate, LOL)."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Where was this movie going?  Past, Present, or Future. Hopefully, they  don’t see Deadpool coming for them."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"honestly it was the best setup for a prequel of spiderman, i felt like seeing the story , before his time , and can make the connection between the two story , i think people want to say it is bad , just because others are saying so , or they want to hate on sony, but it was even better then morbius to be honest , the movie was simple it reminds e a little bit of the sam raimi spiderman , and also a lot of elder people where commenting , come on this is a pg 13 movie , we enjoy it . superhero movie for teenagers , let us comment and say if it is good or  not , maybe you were expecting a big clash ect , but the storyline was perfect , whoever wrote it did a good job at maintaining the connection of the real spiderman in the mvoie , while the other movies as morbius and venom kind of cut it out , and in my head i can already imagine madame web meeting the real spiderman , and imagine the real crossover, but the story would have to be perfect , not just a simple movie where you put a bunch of character . come on guys , give it a chance and watch the movie again , and while watching it , try to imagine the first spiderman ."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Another pile of doodoo from FallingWood
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Please STOP!!!!
Make Marvel great again."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"waste of time, couldn't even justify its existence."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was a fun watch. Definitely a PG-13 movie with a few cheesy lines/actions, but overall a fun watch. I loved that it didn't focus entirely on the superhero aspect and was more of an origin story."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"MADAME WEB is not the disaster she is labeling her....
 Okay, it's not a movie either.  Even so, it's a film with an interesting story that I at least understood why the character doesn't like Spider-Man in the future and at least in this film, she mentions the ""neighborhood friend"" in brief indirect moments...
 The performances are very cool and even though the villain is a bit generic at the beginning, in the end he ends up becoming a typical villain of the universe, even Miranha's!
 But even so... These ignorant critics who say they understand films, but don't even delve into the material from which the idea of ​​making a cinematographic work about a certain character originated, so they keep talking nonsense just because they didn't understand parts of the film. ;  It's the little people wanting to throw rocks, just because of the female protagonism and the marvetes, defecating through their mouths just because some don't know the character or those who want loyalty to the comics, blah-blah-blah..."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Definitely some fun moments, but the writing is pretty bad and some of the plot holes are ridiculous."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Felt just like a pre MCU super hero flick, period appropriate even.  Disappointed it's just a one off but, it was a good time, definitely worth the ticket"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"as bad as youve heard. i was hoping for much better given sony's Venom films and the upcoming kraven the hunter. just wait until its out on a streaming site, its not worth a trip to the cinema"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,SONY STOP MAKING MARVEL MOVIES!!!
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"I don't understand where these criticisms come from. The story may be simple and the idea for the script is well-done, but it's a piece of good old-style cinema. Comic book fans should be happy. I highly recommend watching the show to form your own opinion!"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Honestly, the movie was awful. I didn't expect too much… but, Dakota Johnson is just a terrible actress. If the role went to any other female, it might have been ""ok"". She lacks character and is boring to listen to and watch."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The name of the film should be ""Ambulance Driver Fights Over Food With Other Girls"""
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web was surely one of the movies that Sony had made in their criticly reviewed universe. They surely can make movies.

The villain is an antagonist, and the main character and the side characters are protagonists.
Cant wait to not see this at the oscars!"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,The first half of the movie was hard to follow and had very bad dialogue. Every time we are introduced to a character there is no way to connect or even see relevance in relation to the plot. The villain doesn't seem to have motive besides being strong and it's very boring. When the main character finds the girls the whole thing with her vision is visually very unappealing and disorienting; every camera angle had to be weird and distorted and they could have gotten the same point across with less of a migraine. Like I said before the characters werw barely introduced and explained so by the climax of the movie I felt I had no need to see the ending. I already knew what would happen. I would not recommend anyone watch this movie. The worst part is it had so much potential to be interesting and captivating but instead they wanted to focus on bad jokes and dialogue
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Pelicula subestimada, y criticada sin sentido, es buena, y entretenida."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,They really messed up a character with so much potential
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Muito bom pra dormir !
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Greys Anatomy purinho
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyable! Plenty of the same tropes as other hero movies, and that's what I wanted from it.  100% here for the Sony-verse continuing- hope we do get that Sinister Six and that these gals make an appearance."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,the movie wasn't bad the ending was just the intl bad part and like little things such has things i was hoping to see more when i saw the trailer but really it was terrible how people are defining it it was a fun nice watch
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web, the latest addition to Sony's Spider-Man universe, spins a web of confusion and disappointment from start to finish."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A disjointed movie, lacking connection in the story line.  The superpower of the villain is sometimes strong, sometimes weak.  The film's effects are also very bad"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,I wish I could give it zero stars no clue why they made that movie. There was no action at all the villian was lame and the acting was cheesy. Definitely a huge L for Sony.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Movie wasn't as Action packed as they say . Could have been better 2.5 stars
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"How could this been approved for the big screen? Directors and staff are using to much drugs to think this was even a bare minimum acceptable

Better go back home and rewatch 50 shades.

Cinema is dead."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Soooo BADD WORST MOVIE IVE EVER SEEN good job SONY FOR RUINING MARVEL MOVIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Mid. Was all running away from a fight and no action at all.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I cannot believe this movie was made, let alone released. Sony, you should be embarrassed. And you're going to release Kraven after this? Unreal."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed this one, despite of the plot holes. I went in not expecting too much, and came out satisfied."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was so bad I almost liked it… but not for any of the reasons the director would like…
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"not bad, but not amazing either, and very forgetable; would have been better as a ""TV movie""..."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie was perfection until the end. Ending felt rushed and should have gone a different route, however it was an amazing origin story. Fans need to stop holding all super hero movies to the Avengers Infinity Saga standard and appreciate a good comic movie when they see one."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,I can’t think of positives to continue
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,The most important movie of all time.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Good movie, not the best, not the worse. See it youserlf, I passed a good time seeing this."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Pretty terrible. Lots of questions that just never get answered. And Sydney Sweeney is 26 year old vixen ffs, playing a minor 😆"
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Absaloute Best movie I've seen in a long time, very exicited to see some new spiderman content. Hoghly recomended!"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame web creates an action movie with no action.  Even worse, how about an origin story about superheroes that never get their superpowers.  

Madame web, is probably the worst superhero movie created to date with dialogue so clunky that the main bad guy seems to be voiceover dubbed.  Does this actor not speak English?  90% of his lines are given with his back to the camera probably because the dubbing isn't even that good. Zero stars if I could."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"I dont understand why people hate this movie. I get it that this is not like the other marvell movie, but i love that its an easy movie and happy ending"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie made the wiggles look like a cinematic masterpiece. What was this?
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Wow! Just wow ! They did the i mpossible. They made a worst movie than morbius.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,The concept is great and the performances are brilliant. It's webbing time.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"OOF, this was, this was definitely not good enough for the price. I no longer have any hopes for deadpool3 being good. This made me want a refund. It's like, I don't even mind it wasn't a superhero movie, but at least make it a movie. Something interesting god. Had to walk out of the theater not soon enough."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,This was such an excruciatingly bad and boring movie. I walked out an hour or so into the movie and just looked up the ending at home and nothing interesting happened. They probably should've passed on this one.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"If you are expecting a traditional super hero movie, this isn't it. This has more of a thriller vibe with a dash of super aspects. Very much so an origin story. It was a good movie but not great. It did serve its purpose though of what the director was aiming for. Movie was set in 2003 and felt like it was filmed in 2003 but not in a bad way, more so a creative way."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It had the potential to be really good, it had a unique premise with a lot of opportunities, but the acting and writing was just so bland. The main actresses' moods had a range of charmingly fond to vaguely frustrated. The villain was so monotone and gravelly. And the lines sounded like they came out of a fortune cookie.

At least the main point of the movie, the visions of the future, were well done and fun to watch. I loved how having a superhero with no combat abilities forced her to get super creative, and the final fight was probably the most fun I've had in a superhero movie in years. It was a snapshot into what a great movie this could have been if the parts were recast and they got a better writers room"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,No end credits!  It was at least better than The Marvels I think
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Filme muito sem nexo, roteiro muuuito fraco
Vilao sem personalidade... muito mimimi affs"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It's extremely bad.
It's a sin to watch this movie.
Worst movie of altime."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,this is a spider-man spin off WHAT NOW THIS ISN'T MADAME WEB THIS IS LITTLE GIRL STRING
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The best part of this movie is that it ended.. i couldnt think of a single redeeming feature of the film.

I really really feel sorry for the actors who were dragged into this probably blindsided by their agents.

On top of this the best acting was Dakota telling us we'd want to see it twice..

The story is all over the place, the acting was uninspired, and dialog and directing was terrible and the product placement being forced down your throat was an absolute terrible experience however it feels like they knew it would be a flop in the box offices so they sold it out to whomever they could.

DO NOT WATCH."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Very good movie based on narrative, visual effects, soundtrack and character development. "
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"You'll have a better time watching diarrhea in slow motion. A lot of bots in the reviews giving it 5 stars. One person called it ""amazing"" and I think this is the fault of the American education system."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web is possibly one of the worst Sony-Marvel based superheroes I have ever watched.

With poor to mediocre performances from its cast, choppy editing shots and poorly executed dialogue, underwhelming characters, a soulless and messy script, boring plot and little action sequences. Not even Dakota Johnson could do anything to prevent Madame Web from being an absolute disaster."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The only redeemable thing is the battle but the villain has very little substance, his suit looks like something out of another movie."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"50 Shades Of Spiderman. It's just hard to get past what a terrible actress Dakota Johnson is. Everybody else is believable in their roles, then Dakota wanders on screen, like somebody who snuck on the set. When she talks, all we hear is, ""I'm acting! I'm acting!. My mom and dad got me this role!"" Crikey she's bad. The extras in the background pretending to talk are better actors. As one critic noted, it's the Tofu of Spider-man movies"
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"I might be going against the flow here, but it was refreshing to me to watch a superhero movie with good acting, less green screen, and focused on relationship development. Were those the best characters to add from the Spidey Universe? I don't know, but the film was reminiscent of the older superhero movies, that focused a lot on the human side of those heroes as well. The villain was a bit weak, but I also don't believe this was about him anyway.

Well, I left the session very pleased. The downside for me, were actually the couple of CGI scenes in the movie, but they were also not long."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Dialogue that of a power ranger episode. Every cliche evil villain phrase check marked. 
Just all around very corny. It feels like they could've got away with this in early 90s but not now. #DontWasteYourMoneyOrTime"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,this is not a movie that should be released in the cinema . please refund me my $5 Sony or even better if you leave this spiderman character to marvel .my childhood was hampered by this movie 🤮🤮
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the movie, another movie highly criticized."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A pior coisa que já assisti na História.
Não tem nada. Absolutamente nada. 
Nem oq aparece no trailer tem no filme.
Sony. Parem de fazer filme de Heróis.
Esqueçam. Por favor. 
Deus me livre. 
Quem deu permissão pra isso acontecer.
Sony. Desisto.
Por favor. Retirem isso.
Apaguem da história 
Não tem nada com nada

Alguém me ensina como apagar minha memória e assim me fazer esquecer que assisti isso. 
Entretenimento não é nem 0 é - 1 bilhão.

Enterrar e mandar pra o inferno. 
Bem fácil o diabo mandar de volta 
De tão ruim"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"""It could have been worse; what people sometimes expect from the superhero genre is frustrating. Dakota saving the movie, although I missed some connection to a universe, but it's watchable."""
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It had some good moments, but really needed more plot/character development. Why were the mother and the evil bad guy wanting spiders so bad? why didn't the tree spider people stop him back at the beginning? Why did spiders give you these various powers? Acting was good, the action scenes were ok, but all in all it seemed a bit disjointed."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely horrendous movie. Save your money. The most notable thing was the in your face soft drink product placement. Even then I don't like Pepsi, much prefer Coca Cola ! Seriously, I really thought things couldn't get worse but they did. It's very nice to see the critics being honest for a change."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,What happened here? Terrible!
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"No literally it passed the time,,,,sony do better"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Things went a little bit too far with this movie. Wait for this one to be free on streaming and then see it. Sony has not learned any lessons on movie making.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie was awesome! It's the beginning of Spider girls. I can't wait to see the new movies in the future. Loved it!
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Not the best movie ever created but certainly not the worst. It was better than Venom 2 for sure. I learned about the character, thought it was a good popcorn movie and would like to see it get a sequel. People who lambasted this film are either paid to do so or just aren’t very inceptive to new ideas and characters. "
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"A different kind of super hero movie, a different kind of story, great exhibition by Dakota Johnson. Hope to see a sequel."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,This just isn't a hero movie
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Morbinamenal! A summer movie during winter? Oh what blockbuster fun!! They actually did the thing where they brought the morbengers together to defeat the evil and conniving Morb. It was morrific and I highly recommend everyone watches this master class in film production. THIS IS WHAT THE MOVIES ARE ALL ABOUT!!
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Lots of fun considering the characters aren't super well known.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie was great my only gripe was that didn't have enough spiders suites for me but action was good story line was decent worth going to the movies and giving it your support.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I wanted to like it I go into all movies to see it for myself I don’t just go by what the critics say . But right from the beginning this movie felt awkward it couldn’t get out of its own way. I like Dakota Johnson but she wasn’t right for this casting it’s was painfully bad cringy bad story , bad casting , bad editing I lasted 45 minutes. "
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"É um filme de herói mediano, mas consegue ser diferente e divertido"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"rotten, rotten, rotten"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,the worst superhero movies I've ever seen. The script is ridiculous.  It tries everything and delivers nothing entertaining.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"For a thousand different reasons, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Easily the worst writing I've seen, and I've seen The Room twice."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Awful, I think the writers may have been on a secret strike"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Madame web was decent.  Started off kind different. Knowing it was a marvel movie, I expected a little more in depth meat to the movie. The film did ok.  It did not explain a couple of things. At the end, I knew I seen the movie on TV as a cartoon as a child."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was bad movie very upset 😠
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,If it was a tv show pilot it would be 8 out if 10. As a theatre movie its a 6.0 at best. Its not near as bad as people say it is. Much better then fantastic 4 by Mr Trank. Its a touch better then Morbius also. Not as corny. The budget seemed low if it was over 50 million then someone is laundering money. Its worth seeing on TV.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I REALLY wanted to like this film, but unfortunately my eyes and ears work, so I just couldn't.

Right away the forced Ben Parker connection felt just that - forced. It was a needless ""tie-in"" that did nothing for the story. And while we're talking story...WHAT THE ACTUAL F!? There is no real story. 

I'm a long-time Spider-Man comic collector, reader and watcher, and the changing of Cassandra's character is another Sony FAIL. I'm sure they couldn't call her a mutant bc Marvel owns that somehow, but the entire jungle and spider bite thing just doesn't work. What else doesn't work?  Well, everything, tbh. 

The cinematography and direction seem to be at a TV movie level from the 90s.  Even the actors (I typically enjoy Dakota Johnson & Sydney Sweeney) seemed to phone in their performances. The only actors who brought anything to the table were Adam Scott & Emma Roberts, who was weirdly cast as Mary Parker, but okay. 

Overall, this film further solidifies that Sony have ZERO IDEA with what to do with Spider-Man characters, and I am now genuinely afraid for the upcoming Kraven The Hunter film, bc this film left me longing for the tortured cinematic disaster of Morbius and more ""Morbin' time,"" rather than sitting through another uninspired minute of the female led cast that failed to deliver on any level."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,I liked this movie. The first half you can laugh at but the second half is fun. And the acting from Sydney Sweeney and Dakota Johnson was good!
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Funny good balance of story and action solid movie
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Aburrida de princio a fin
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Just the worst. It doesn't deserve more than that.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Pointless and sloppy! Keeping the spiderman title and money are the only reason this was released. Praying they give the title to disney for good.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Cassandra Web é uma paramédica de Nova York, que após quase morrer em um acidente, ganha poderes de clarividência. Com esses poderes, ela acaba descobrindo que três jovens estão sendo caçadas por um estranho homem chamado Ezekiel Sims, que tem ligação com o passado de Cassandra. Madame Teia é um dos personagens coadjuvantes do Homem-Aranha. Nunca teve grande importância, talvez mais pelo seu visual: uma senhora cega, com uma venda sobre os seus olhos, sentada em uma estranha cadeira que lembra uma teia de aranha. Esta cadeira a mantém viva por causa de uma doença degenerativa que ela possui. Possui os mesmos poderes do filme, que ela usa para se sustentar como médium. Pode até ser uma personagem interessante, porém é só isso. Não havia origem nem nada. Aí a Sony vem e faz um filme com esta personagem, inclui mais uma série de outras mulheres-aranhas (Araña, Aracne e Mulher-Aranha), altera um outro (Ezekiel Sims), cria uma ligação com o Homem-Aranha (com os personagens de Ben Parker, tio do Peter, e Mary Parker, mãe de Peter) e entrega esta maçaroca para o público. Até um certo ponto, o filme estava OK, mas quando surge um vilão como Ezekiel Sims, totalmente vazio, sem nenhum propósito a não ser caçar as três adolescentes, acaba o tornando o pior vilão possível. Alguma das soluções do roteiro são péssimas e dá-lhe Deus Ex-Machina. O que eu fico chateado com a Sony é que o Homem-Aranha, depois do Batman, é o personagem de quadrinhos com os melhores coadjuvantes e vilões. Antes da Madame Teia, há tantos outros personagens mais interessantes,  porém o problema é o quanto independentes eles podem ser do Homem-Aranha. Venom é. Morbius também. Madame Teia também é independente pois não se ligou tão fortemente ao aracnídeo, mas não tem background nenhum. Se os filmes de heróis de 2024 começam assim, tenho medo dos seguintes."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Sinceramente, até agora eu não compreendi o que a Sony queria fazer com esse filme...
Ele não tem gênero: ele não é ação, nem drama, nem comédia, nem aventura, nem ficção científica, nem fantasia, nem nada. É um amontoado de cenas que parecem pontes em ruínas ligado o nada a lugar nenhum. e quer conseguiu ter uma teia que ligasse os pontos da história. Ele não é nada. Em especial, ele não é nada de bom.
Esse filme é ruim, chato, entediante, com uma direção inconsistente, atuações horríveis, simplesmente ridículas.
A história é pífia, com tentativas patéticas de fan services, que se funcionou para alguém, esse alguém é um mongolão.
Quero meu dinheiro de volta para jogá-lo no esgoto. É melhor uso."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,I actually enjoyed watching this movie allot. I know it wasn't endgame level good but it's a average movie.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The first 2/3 of this movie are absolutely fine. Nothing good, or bad, besides a very forgettable villain with a generic bad guy voice and obviously ADRd lines. 

The final 1/3 of the movie is like the people behind the movie just went she has vague future sight powers? Well thats not visually interesting. Lets add to this power set and make it very bad. The epilogue only makes things worse.

Theres also no post-credit scene, so if youre curious, you can leave ASAP"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,'Madame Web' is a subpar superhero feature failed by its clunky and messy execution.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Had a ball loved the story and characters in it very different goes against the grain a good thing Dakota was brilliant
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Muito bom, tem sido criticado como td filme com protagonistas mulheres da Marvel mas vale mto a pena ver, o filme te da um contexto e possui começo meio e fim, vc nn precisa ter visto os outros para entender, adorei!!"
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"It really wasnt as bad people were making out in the initial reviews. It was a fun movie, like movies should be."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"it's just a boring movie. so much potential totally wasted on a boring movie
boring plot
boring dialogs
boring action
boring boring"
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"I like the superhero movies the origin stories, so I like the movie very much. Except some of the CGI works, but it can be overlooked. This was a beginning, so I am looking forward to another part."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,I really love the movie it was very good action a lot of action through it so hopefully they're make another one. Is it very different to the Spider-Man movie? I liked it if you like Marvel go to see it if you don't like Marvel don't go see it that's my opinion
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Absolute stunning to see these 4 girls' outstanding performances. Love the way they introduce the background story of Madame Web
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Puff. . . It is very strange indeed.

It's not the fault of the actresses, it's the script, and the Trailer is a big rip off, everything they show there is just the interesting stuff. Too much comedy added { You can tell it's Marvel 2.0 }, and again I repeat, it's very strange.

And also when something interesting happens it doesn't last at all.

It happens all too fast, even if they should improve the movie, it would need more length, and better explained.

And not be so boring.

I wouldn't even give it a 5/10.

It's more like a 2/10."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I really wanted to like this movie. Dakota Johnson is a likeable actress but unfortunately it is the only thing that webs this film together. Messy editing, poor dialogue, predictable writing and underwhelming performances by supporting actors. Passed the time but stretched for too long of what could have been an entertaining film with intriguing components."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Y'all are insane if you think Madame Web is bad, I just saw it, the movie is good, yeah it's not Endgame level good but all you Marvel and Marvel/Sony Fans just remember it's a average movie not a fucking 500M budget movie, and for what we got I thought it was pretty good, and with the visuals, I reckon they were pretty close to being Loki season 2 finales visuals."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Only Because Of Dakata Johnson otherwise 0 Star from me.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,NO WORDS BEST MOVIE EVER
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"1. people need to realize this that marvel didn't make this movie, Sony did. 
2. I enjoyed the movie. I was never bored or confused. I laughed at the jokes and I thought Dakota did a great job with what she was given. 
3. The villain voice actor was distracting. I don't know if it's his voice or someone else but all of his dialogue acting was bad. 
4. The plot was good but some of the dialogue towards the last third of the movie was cheesy and too much ""saying what's happening"" rather than ""showing what's happening"" 
5. So overall better casting/(sound editing)  on the villain and better dialogue during the serious parts of the film would have made this a 5 star"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Jeez.......... erm...... some positives first. 

right, now the positives are all listed we can get on with the negatives but roll them all up in to a neat bow by saying "" this is awful "".  this is worse that FF4, worse than Morbius. dont waste your time."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,The action was pretty good
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"People giving this anything more than 2 stars are mentally ill. This is a garbage film. Atrocious acting, laughable plot, and completely void of any point in existing. Who wanted this?? Sony has got to be the most out of touch studio of all time. DO NOT support this abysmal movie. "
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Most boring and pointless movie I've ever seen. Acting was horrendous, script was laughably dull, and don't even get me started on the effects. If you're going to watch a movie, pick literally anything other than this."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Just… why? This movie was awful. The idea was awful. Everything about it was awful.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"I don't know what everyone's problem is I thought it was a great movie. What did you guys expect honestly The scenes are amazing And the bond, three girls and madam webb build throughout the movie was beautiful and had me crying, But I guess most people nowadays don't care about that kind of stuff right, You guys don't care about love or being positive which, Anyone who disliked this movie definitely does not have love or compassion for others And just takes day-to-day life for granted until something tragic happens in your life I don't know why alot of people live like that But I'm the one who doesn't And despite the mental health I have and what i'm going through And how most days I don't even want to get out of bed. I still Am the kind of person who always asks someone how they're doing or how their day is going. I mean, I literally talked to a few staff in the theater and ask them that Because it's called being considerate and caring of others besides yourself and that's how I'm always able to connect with a lot of people. Again Anyone who disliked the movie is wrong this movie was amazing in my book and I hope they make a madame web 2! 💖🥰🙌🏻"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,People are so hard to please. This movie was good. Don't go into it expecting it to link to Spider-man and take it for what it is and you'll enjoy it just fine.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Nepotism is going to sink Hollywood if it isn't careful. They should consider giving opportunities to people with talent and training for a change.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed Madame Web and hope to see her spiderling saga continue. It was interesting to see a new, and far more intuitive superhero and one who foster children and those who have lost a parent young can relate to. Madame Web is a unique glimpse into a Maternal instinct-driven character who embodies female empowerment and leans into an extrasensory perception that otherwise might be dismissed. It seems like a fragile ability that can only do so much. Still, when Cassie begins to connect with her inner self and revelations about pain and ancestral trauma are laid to rest she becomes a fierce opponent and carries through to shine brilliantly as a victorious, protective powerhouse with a soft and golden heart."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"it's hard to make a movie worse than Mobius, but Sony did it!  Sony is trying to make Disney look good with those awfull movies in 2023"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I had low expectations but the movie is actually good. There story is actually good and there are some really interesting scenes.
It had lots of potential but unfortunately they didn't use them all."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,So bad its fun just to watch how bad it is.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,I think this movie is fantastic. At this point if you expect more from Sony then camp pulp garbage slop you are fucking stupid. This movie was fine. It's cheesy and fun. At times it's kinda of ballsy. I really think this movie has potential and a sequel would be really good. Yes I am aware of the bad ADR and acting. I don't give a fuck.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It has a plot hole central conceit so large, you could drive Webb's ambulance through it, but it was a fun watch and added a few nice levels to the Spiderverse lore."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"such a fun watch, I really ended up admiring the film for the origin story it is and told us it was going to be. Everyone should give this film a chance, i left the theater wanting more and wishing the film was longer."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Definitely worth watching again.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, funny, plot was great. But let’s be real it’s a marvel comic based movie…. Where was the post credits scene?!!"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,The plot hole was so big Optimus Prime can drive right thru it without touching either side.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,The previous marvel movies from 2023 was just bad news. But this one it was good not great just good.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Omggggg I couldn't stand it a went out of the cinema I love Dakota but this movie is so boring :(
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Eu não consigo entender o problema da Sony, ela literalmente tem um dos maiores personagens da Marvel se não for o maior com vários personagens ótimos, com inimigos incríveis e entrega esse tipo de filme...
Que filme chato e sem graça com cara de série da CW, sem ação e sem suspense. E vem o Hessel do Omelete e diz que prefere madame teia do que soldado invernal kkkkk....
Nossa a Sony pode ter o próprio multiverso criar o aranhagerdom com vários aranhas mas prefere fazer um filme tosco assim. Eu prefiro pensar que é lavagem de dinheiro que fica menos feio aí não parecem serem tão incompetentes assim kkkk"
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,It was an originstory like the old marvelmovies like iron man or spiderman. People always cried after this and when it happens they act like thats the worst film ever released.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Was weird but i enjoyed it, Dakota is amazing"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Unexplained characters and story line. Amazing this was even made.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Just another total waste of time...
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Title: ""Madame Web: A Tangled Mess in Marvel's Cinematic Universe""

In the latest installment of Marvel's cinematic universe, ""Madame Web"" attempts to weave a complex narrative but ends up entangling itself in its own web of confusion and mediocrity. Despite the anticipation and potential for a deep dive into the mystic and psychic realms of Marvel, the film disappoints on multiple levels, leaving fans bewildered and underwhelmed.

The storyline, which ambitiously tries to intertwine multiple timelines and dimensions, is as clear as mud. It's evident that the writers attempted to create a rich tapestry of interconnected stories, but the execution falls flat, leaving the audience more lost than intrigued. The plot holes are so vast that not even Madame Web's psychic abilities could predict where the narrative is headed next.

Performance-wise, the cast seems as disoriented by the script as the viewers. Despite their best efforts, their portrayals lack the depth and charisma expected from Marvel's usually dynamic characters. The dialogue, intended to be witty and profound, often comes across as forced and uninspired, missing the mark on both humor and emotional impact.

Visually, the film is a mixed bag. While some CGI sequences are impressive, others are surprisingly lackluster for Marvel's high standards, breaking the immersion and making it hard to stay engaged in the supposed spectacle. The action scenes, a staple of superhero movies, are oddly paced and choreographed, lacking the exhilaration and creativity seen in the franchise's better entries.

Perhaps the most perplexing aspect of ""Madame Web"" is its seeming forgetfulness of what makes Marvel movies special: heart, humor, and heroism. This film feels like a departure from those principles, prioritizing convoluted storytelling over character development and genuine engagement with the audience.

In conclusion, ""Madame Web"" is a missed opportunity to explore one of Marvel's most intriguing characters. It's a bewildering journey through a poorly constructed narrative that even the most loyal of Marvel fans might find hard to follow. Instead of adding a rich layer to the MCU, it feels like a detour into mediocrity. Let's hope future projects can untangle this mess and bring back the magic that fans know and love."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,One of the absolute worst movies I've ever seen. Have never felt as if I wasted something as much as the money I spent to go see this.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,Es una película de origen que cumple con las normas. El desarrollo de la trama algo lento pero tiene picos de acción interesante.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Did not deserve the hate. If you watch super hero movies, it's a standard film and was enjoyable. Are there some immersion and plot issues? Sure. But is it still better than a lot of other films? Yeah, especially most DC and most Sony standalone superhero movies."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"I just loved it, stop saying the movie is bad, every time there's a movie about a hero girl people started to criticize the movie, saying that they can't act, the storyis horrible..... I watch the movie and I love it, Dakota Johnson did a great job, Celeste O' Connor did a great job, Isabela Merced did a great job, Sydney Sweeney did a great job, and all the rest of the cast. So stop saying the movie is bad, your expectations are too high for everything, I can honestly say that I will go back to the theatre and watch it again. 
Thank u"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Weak writing and directing. I didn't like that these performers delivered these lines the way they did when in other movies they've done way better.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Eh ..... What was the whole point of this? I went into it not expecting to be blown away but hoping it would at least be somewhat enjoyable and it was just so ... bland. Unfortunately, Dakota Johnson just doesn't have the charisma or talent to carry a film. And that's just one of the problems with this film. Video review: youtu.be/t4h1HTPrUxo"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Forbidden!! Do not even think about going there. The absolute worst!
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Lamentablemente Sony mintió a sus fans con publicidad engañosa y eso es lo que más duele de esta película, los trailers te ponen las espectativas super altas, y luego te entregan una película de origen de personajes hecha muy a lo 2000, un villano con pésimas o nulas motivaciones, malos dialogos y varios errores de guión, insisto si las espectativas fueran mucho menores pasaría como una película disfrutable lo verdaderamente malo fue la piblicidad engañosa..."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Put*sima Mier*a, esta película jamás debió existir."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"I feel like this movie brings out a sense of belonging in between Madame Web and the girls. It is a great movie which I recommend, because it is action-packed and filled  with sequences. It may seem a little confusing, but you will get the whole storyline."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,I thought the movie was great. Gave me a laugh.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,If we could only see the future to know how awful this movie was. Not the typical marvel movie. Very cheesy bad scripting and I think the villain was dubbed or something. Man I was looking forward to a great movie and this was trash. But hey if you have nothing to do and have an unlimited movie pass go see it!! It's hilarious. 
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Just saw Madame Webb tonight with my best friend. We absolutely loved it! It was very well done! Dakota did a great job loved the story and can't wait to see more out of the future superheroes ladies! I laughed, I cried, I was on the edge of my seat! I jumped quite a few times and it had some great action scenes. It was so good. The effects were stellar and the way it was shot was really cool. I hope there are more of these Madame Webb movies. Very excited to see where the story goes."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Wasn’t as bad as people make it to be, I enjoyed it with my kids."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Such a great movie! Highly recommend! Found the movie very interesting. Can't wait to watch again!
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web introduces a fresh character to the superhero universe, but the film itself plays it safe. The screenplay offers some decent moments, but overall, it feels like a missed opportunity. There's potential here, yet the execution leaves it feeling just okay. It's still a watchable film if you're a fan of the genre. However, don't expect a groundbreaking addition to the Spider-Verse; Madame Web ultimately settles for a predictable formula.  Dakota Johnson delivers a solid performance as Cassandra Webb, but the supporting cast feels underdeveloped. The film's visuals are occasionally striking, but lack the distinct style that could have elevated the material. While there are hints of a more compelling story, Madame Web never quite finds its footing."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The best part of this movie were Easter Eggs where it hinted at Peter Parkers parents/uncle before he was born. Seeing that connection was cool. The acting, graphics, and camera zoom were pretty bad though. Definitely a low budget film. The actor who was the main villain Azekiel was probably the worst actor ive ever seen in a Marvel associated film."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,This is an amazing thrilling film. From the beginning to end i was at the edge of my seat. It didn’t have a boring moment
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Loved and enjoyed highly recommend it
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Considering this to be an intro movie it intrigued me on what's to come. Lacking on the fight scenes, (because there isn't any real fighting just the 3 girls getting destroyed in potential futures) the depiction of the main characters ability to see the future was pretty cool and made up for it. Overall decent movie with an almost nostalgic feel with its contemporary references."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Toxic by Britney Spears was genuinely the only good thing in this movie.

Also the product placement was craaaazy"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was kinda boring. 🥱 I understand it's setting a story for her but it could of been better..
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,A solid base for a spiderwoman film franchise. Enjoyable to hero film! Looking forward to it exceeding critics expectations and reaching its full potential.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,It could've been so much more. It's time for Sony to just call it quits and let Marvel take over.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Red flag 🚩 from the start to finish HORRIBLE
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this movie. Is it MCU, nope but it is a good Sony movie."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This was legitimately one of the worst superhero movies I’ve ever seen. Venom and Morbius were mediocre, but still enjoyable. Madame Web was a disappointment on nearly every level."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Although the idea of seeing all of these different characters be introduced was exciting the execution was not. As someone who loves to see these movies, I figured that most of the people saying this movie was bad were exaggerating…they were not. The story is all over the place, the characters felt hollow not to mention within an hour the 3 teenage girls are all trauma dumping and completely discrediting their backstories. The beginning and end of the movie felt incredibly rushed, the editing seemed unfinished, and the villain was a generic man who had a bad life. I love these actresses and it would have been incredible to see them get to play these characters in full depth. Not just throwing all of their backstories together in a hope that people would get the full story on them. It was incredibly disappointing to watch two hours of absolute confusion and lack of good writing when I was super excited to see these characters be introduced."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"If Madame Web's web 'ties them all', I'd like her web to tie me to the ceiling after watching this movie."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Decided to watch this movie thinking it was going to be good and was left disappointed. The plot of the movie was very hard to follow because of how badly the future scenes were presented. Sure the movie was trying to confuse the audience which is fine but the creators could have had a much better approach. Along with all of the problems it felt super rushed and not properly planned, the movie had loads of inconsistencies that left the audience feeling dissatisfied."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Cassie is selfless! Those who say ""it's a dud, or not worth watching…."" Clearly do not have a heart! 

Dakota did an amazing job, and I'm ready for the next movie. Great actress with true emotions."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Good direction to a more aggressive take of Man-spider his moves are unmatched by Spiderman. Sadly, the ambulance scenes beat the movie then it goes downhill despite the cool action sequences. The Marvels have to work together without laser beam powers, instead of controlling time they can occasionally adapt to the future. Not as ambitious as the cover poster suggested."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Sony needs to give up the rights to anything marvel. I love everything about Marvel, this was awful. The antagonists words were edited in post making his mouth not match what was being said, the storyline didn’t make sense, and how is Peter Parker born in 2003 when spider man was released in 2002. Also why is Ben Parker so young in 2003?"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie is a rough one. Didn’t like the villain, and I don’t blame the actors. I blame the writers. Final fight was best part and even that was lackluster imo. Something tells me they made this just to keep the rights to the Spiderman franchise."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Badly written, poorly executed, terrible casting and boring tbh. Save your money, this is not must see Marvel."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"¡Amé esta película, disfruté al máximo cada segundo! No puedo esperar para volverlas a ver, plantó las bases para un prometedor futuro"
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"this film is AMAZING! Oscar worthy dialogue keeps you gripped! The tension keeps building, the acting is truly Top shelf stuff. A triumph! I think SJ Clarkson has a bright career ahead of her after this. Just as Superhero movies are failing to entertain, out of the shadows comes Madam Web! It was equivalent to watching Endgame and Infinity War for the first time! Watch Watch Watch!!!"
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Confused on the hate. I really enjoyed this movie! I really hope they do another. Dakota was perfect for the role. Glad i went to see it.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"I have become a big Marvel fan, I love the way they are introducing new characters, since most of the classic one are getting too old or dying, loved the movie, it was entertaining for us, fun, and will keep ok watching all Marvel movies"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I don’t know why people are hating. I thought it was a good movie. I think a lot of people are giving bad reviews just because Sony was involved. It could have been better, but I want a sequel. Edit: Never-mind, the last fight was terrible. "
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Man, I went in hoping that there would have been SOME redeeming quality. But the wooden acting in the opening scene lived up to the hype I had heard. I tried to be interested in the story line. Just was so tough. Even Morbius was better than this and that is saying something."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Was a great movie, if you seen the preview of it you still want to go see it, there so much more not shown on the preview."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's not as bad as many people say.

There is one thing that really annoyed me: The trailer showed action and the presence of 3 spider girls, but in the movie, there was no such... So, at some point, I felt scammed."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,Ok... it wasn't that bad. People gotta chill
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Someone walking out the theater said Sharknado was better then this.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,It wasnt terrible but it wasnt great. A very 50/50 movie for me. The visual effects were pretty good for mos of the movie. The last act was were I felt  the story went off the rails.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Some cool ideas but really clunky dialog and stilted action.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Don't listen to the haters! This is a scream. Eat some gummies and laugh.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Not good.  Not good at all
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie is not what I expected I thought it was gonna be action and fighting because of all the trailers I've been seeing on TikTok but in fact it's nothing like it. Would have rather seen it at home than waste money on it.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I think the idea for this movie was great but felt it just fell short everywhere. To keep it simple I found the actors poor (maybe because the dialogue was that bad and they had to work with what they had), the plot was choppy, and an action movie had like no action. Didn’t need the 3 spiderwomen either. Would’ve been better if we just focused on Ms Web."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I don't read reviews before I go to a movie, but for Madame Web I wish I had. I  haven't seen anything else Dakota Johnson has been in, but I get the feeling she was cast because people thinks she's sexy. Her acting in this movie was like suffering through ten hours of someone scraping their fingernails on a chalkboard.The bad guy 

Tahar Rahim's villain was a bad joke.

I don't expect masterpieces from movies, but this mess didn't even meet my low movie standards of simply being a bit of entertainment away from the house."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Misleading trailer, bad script, terrible dialogue, bad editing and sound!
Why did they make this movie?????"
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, i love It❤️"
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Name a better Pepsi Cola ad. YOU CAN'T.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,I absolutely adored this movie. It had great camera work. Wonderful score. The cast absolutely smashed it. It felt so immersive. A definite recommend.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"HORRIVEL, vou processar os donos do projeto, eles irão ter que pagar minha terapia pós filme, perder minha vó foi menos traumático que assistir isso"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,It was okay but the movie takes place in different universe. Like we are watching origin story
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,cheesy and not very marvel
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It wasnt as bad as how critics are describing it. Yes, its kind of clickbaity when it comes to the 3 spiderwomen, but the title of the movie is Madame Web, and IT IS her origin story and not of the 3 other girls."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Admit I knew the Tomatometer score before going so I wasn't expecting too much. I knew the character from the comics but the one I knew was a wheelchair bound,blind old lady. So, I have no idea how this story is going to work. Work. well not very well. Not only does this movie have plot hole you can drive a truck through, you can sail a cruise ship through them. Stealing cabs and ambulances; I doubt NYPD is that cavalier towards these incidents. An ending where the ignored /semi-ignored girl, the runaway, and the illegal alien all get to live with the lady who kidnapped them and now has no visible means of support. A forest in New Jersey within nearby driving distance (1.5 hr?) of Queens. To be fair the story doesn't get too weird until the second half. Until then it's just an odd origins story where a near-death experience causes her latent prescient  abilities are activated. Past that it gets crazy. 
P:2, A:5, D:3,F/X:6 EV:3 = 3.8"
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie is very good
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie gives ""hot garbage"" a bad name. So many plot holes, stupid characters and an incomprehensible story. What the -hell- was that?!? Please save yourself the brain cancer and DO NOT go see this movie. Anyone that likes this drippy scab of a movie is clearly not in the right frame of mind. The only thing that kept me sane was the popcorn and soda. When I ran out, I went to the bathroom for a few minutes, just to wash the stank off."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I wish I could give it zero stars it was that bad. No plot, bad dialogue, Dakota Johnson is overrated, she has been so bored during press it was obvious she doesn't care. Total waste of money and time."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Yeah [enhance], I can't even make a joke about this one."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Yet more evidence Sony can't recreate the Marvel magic and that superhero fatigue is real.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed this! I had wondered since this was announced about how this was going to work and they did a pretty good job with a number of aspects of the character. Some scenes are a amazing. The script was pretty bad in places but quite clever in others. The cast was great. And it was quite tense at times. This is way better than people made out. I hope we see this character in the next Spider-Man film.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,I liked the movie & I understood the plot
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,This is a low point for humanity.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,Dialogue was not the best but I have faith in the next one.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not gonna lie…this movie was worse than Love and Thunder, and that’s saying something. I don’t think the right people were cast for the roles, and the acting was not it either. I hope the next Deadpool movie saves Marvel."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,It’s like they lost their budget and writers halfway through the movie. Sony needs to sell the rights to Disney already and stop milking the franchise
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Es una pelicula no tan común en el genero de super héroes pero fresca
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Honestly, I wanted to like it. The acting was obviously bad, it almost felt like Dakota didn't want to do the movie… Then she saves the girls, then she can't stand them, then she wants to teach them, then she's like their mother… lol. The writing was awful. Let's just say if these writers went on strike… I'd ask for what?"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Came in with low expectations… it was worse! Complete trash ! 🗑️
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"OK, once again my weekly rant about the movie rating system.   I think critics and audience reviews should be required to show a ticket stub or something to post a review.   I think 75% of audience reviews and 50% of critic reviews don't even see the actual movie.   Certainly all the negative reviews I have read are not talking about the same movie I just saw.    Madame Web was a very good movie.   My only complaint is I wish it was longer, especially since all the negative reviews will probably kill the box office and thus scrap the sequel and extended Sony universe plans.    The movie had a great flow, it explained what was going on.  It was exciting to see, show and tell us how Madame Web learned to use her powers.   I guess honestly the her exploring her powers could have been a little longer (thus my comment about it being too short of a movie may be justified).   The acting was good, the story was good, it had a good mix of humor, drama and action and it was just a very good entertaining movie."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,Agood detailed beginning to a new series in the mcu.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I made an account just to say how bad the writing, directing and film was. I could of written a better script in a day. Sony if your hiring I'm available."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,A bit slow at times but loved it! I can't wait for the next installment! Well done Sony/Marvel!
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,I thought is was full of surprises and very entertaining. Just watch out for the boom.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame web, to put it lightly, was incredibly boring. To give a better understanding, it felt like Final Destination, the later films, and no aspects of horror. To think this was made by Sony, who has the rights to the Spider-Man IP. This felt like a generic film studio trying to use Spider-Man esque gimmicks but trying to avoid being sued for copyright infringement. Even if the studio was unsure which Spider-Man's universe this would take place in, what does it hurt to reveal Mary Parker's baby's name. Or even to hint that Uncle Ben, Ben Parker is dating someone and they won't even say May's name, like huh?! But enough of that. The two portrayals I'm only going to critique are Dakota Johnson's and Tahar Rahim's. In short, the latter's portrayal as the main villain, Ezekiel, was so superficial and CW like. This was definitely not a movie worthy portrayal, more like TV. I blame the writing and directing. The same goes for Dakota Johnson's part but man was that some bad acting. Sony needs to stick to the animated Spiderverse films and leave live action to Marvel Studios."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"It wasn't a perfect movie but it kept me entertained and it gave off different vibes at times that were all good. The story was nice and it has some nice little nods to the Spider-Man Universe. The acting was good, they could have left a couple things out but it was a lot better than some of the stuff I recently watched from Marvel. I think only a couple shows and movies from Marvel last couple phases were better."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,This move proves marvel is on a downfall and that only Deadpool 3 can revive it.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Why was this made? I want a sequel though just to see how low the ratings can go
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"When Toby Maguire's Spider-Man movie came out people didn't liked it. When Andrew Garfield's The Amazing Spider-Man movie came out people didn't liked it. When Tom Holland's Spider-Man: Homecoming movie came out nobody liked it. After some time those movies starting to grow on people and they started to see those movies for what they really are. I feel like that's what's happening to Madame Web right now. I enjoyed it, I liked it and I would watch it again. I understood the plot of the movie, the story, the visual effects are insane and there was humor (I see Peter takes after his mom). I do wish Sony didn't cut the connection between Andrews Spider-Man, or even Toms, but stuff happens. I'm not a director or anything like that. I just know what I like and Madame Web is something I like."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"""Madame Teia"" é uma obra cinematográfica que deixa muito a desejar em vários aspectos. Do enredo à execução, o filme não consegue envolver o espectador e proporcionar uma experiência cinematográfica satisfatória.

A trama parece desconexa e sem coesão, dificultando a compreensão e o envolvimento emocional com os personagens. Os diálogos são superficiais e carecem de profundidade, contribuindo para um frágil desenvolvimento da narrativa.

Além disso, a qualidade da produção deixa muito a desejar. Os efeitos especiais são rudimentares e parecem datados, o que compromete a imersão do público no universo do filme. A direção também deixa a desejar, com escolhas questionáveis que não favorecem a fluidez da história.

O elenco, apesar de contar com nomes talentosos, parece deslocado e incapaz de elevar o nível do roteiro. As performances muitas vezes parecem forçadas, contribuindo para a sensação geral de desconexão e inautenticidade.

No geral, ""Madame Teia"" revela-se uma completa desilusão, não conseguindo corresponder às expectativas mínimas de um filme de qualidade. A nota 0 atribuída reflecte a profunda insatisfação com esta produção, que pode ser classificada sem hesitação como uma verdadeira perda de tempo e recursos."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,I can't wait for the midnight screenings where people throw things at the screen to start.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"I walked into the spiderweb, my Spidey senses were going off. I walked out of this movie, feeling very satisfied. Loved the webs. Loved the Spider-Man costume play. I walked out with the Peter Tingle."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Me dormí 😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Madame Web was a fun ride for any fan of the Spider-verse. Showcase some lesser known heroes and a wild villian this film was a fun, trippy ride the whole way through.   With many nods to the comic franchise and the other movies realities, MW shos great potential for the future of superhero films. I for one hope to see lots of other characters and stories getting a similar treatment in the future."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"La pelicula es muy buena, no deberian hacerle caso a los criticos… se dan cuenta que la pelicula esta ""BASADA"" en un comic?… quiere decir que es un entretenimiento nuevo para el nuevo publico. La opinion de los adultos o ya viejos que lo leyeron es muy erronea.
Yo lei los comic… y creo que es el otro comic pero en video para la nueva audiencia."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Yall are some haters for sure! Madame Web was better than The Marvel's, Ms.Marvel, She/Hulk, and Morbius! The visuals were pretty solid! I guess if there was terrible looking blue screen in every shot like a Marvel Studios movie yall would be drooling over this movie. This actually told a cohesive story, with tons of heart. While you could argue about all the plot points you didn't like all day, from a production standpoint it's a well made film. The cinematography/ color grade was fantastic. The set design actually blended in so well, I couldn't tell where the blue screen normally is. Also I loved the editing surrounding her premonitions. The quick paced editing actually moves the movie along quite well. Curious to see where Sony takes these characters next."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,This is movie was a disaster from start to finish
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The villian was a waste of time, unforgettable and not likable. Dakota Johnson did the best she could with the script she was given but ultimately was a let down. Sony needs to step up their game with their next installation. Otherwise they might have to sell spider.an back to Disney."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It was nice to see a new super hero.  However, the beginning of the movie was very slow , but it got more exciting in the middle of the movie.  Dakota Johnson did a fairly good job."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Can’t wait for the 2 one
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Eu, como fã, achei o filme muito bom, não sei pq tanta crítica ao filme."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The story feels completely pointless. There are hints of plot lines that were originally intended but then abandoned. The acting is embarrassingly bad, but I'll chalk that up to direction and writing (because the writing is really, really bad).

They wanted this early 2000s aesthetic but honestly, this all just makes it seem even more like a horrible superhero movie that's actually from that time period. Daredevil, Catwoman, etc. This was just an absolutely despicable movie."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The only thing that surprised me in this movie was I didn't need to use my brain to think about what was going to happen next but I knew it..... It's so boring. Nothing new. it's like a comic book for 7 year old kids, level 2 or 3 reading, except the killing part. I would rate 0."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie is so messy and boring.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,Dakota Johnson is so good. Honestly not as bad as people say.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,The film fulfills its role as entertainment. I went to the cinema thinking I was going to find a disaster and it was a great surprise to find Madame Web. The critics are very bitter.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Movie is great, not perfect but great!
Don't see why so many bad reviews."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie. The acting was outstanding! I do believe that this movie was to set up the sequel but would have had liked to have seen the whole crew play a role. Does it deserve a sequel? Absolutely!
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,This was such an amazing action movie. It’s a movie you will never forget.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I have to say, this was legitimately one of the worst superhero movies I've ever seen. While films like Venom and Morbius were mediocre, they still managed to provide some level of enjoyment with their action-packed sequences and intriguing characters. However, Madame Web, unfortunately, fell short on nearly every level.

From the storyline to the character development, Madame Web left much to be desired. The plot felt convoluted and disjointed, lacking the cohesive narrative that is essential for any successful superhero movie. Additionally, the character of Madame Web herself failed to captivate audiences in the same way as other iconic superheroes.

Furthermore, the visual effects and CGI in Madame Web were subpar, failing to deliver the immersive experience that audiences have come to expect from modern superhero films. The action scenes felt uninspired, lacking the excitement and intensity that are characteristic of the genre.

Overall, while Venom and Morbius may not have been masterpieces, they at least managed to entertain audiences to some extent. However, Madame Web failed to live up to even the lowest of expectations, making it a disappointment for fans of the superhero genre."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great movie, it fulfills its function of entertaining"
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Ótimo! 
Amei do início ao fim!
Plot incrível!"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This was awful. So bad. It's a girl power movie where everything feels forced. The characters are poorly represented. They shouldn't have been introduced in an ensemble movie. Everything feels super cringe. How Spider-Man is to exist in this universe is laughable. Especially with ""evil Spider-Man"" running rampant. What the hell was Sony thinking?"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"buena película solo por las actrices, villano muy malo"
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"The film is AMAZING there is no other way to describe it. The performances were impeccable, the characters were so charismatic that they won us over, the feeling of feeling close to all the girls was the best.  Cassie was such a well-constructed character, the best superhero origin for sure, this film came to revolutionize the entire concept we have of superheroes. The references to the 2000s, the very well executed, frantic and intense action scenes made the film exciting and insane, it was another level for superhero action films. In other words, this film arrived to BREAK EVERYTHING. Besides, definitely a perfect heroine. Dakota Johnson was right to say that the best part about Cassie is that her power is her mind."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Pior filme que já vi prometeu tudo e entregou nada ...
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"it's not as horrible as some may say & definitely not as great as some say.
it's an entertaining movie...yes it could've been better."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Very Boring, esta muy aburrida la pelicula, bastante decepcionante"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A hard watch. Acting, effects, filming style make it all unlikeable and very boring"
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"I think its a good movie, not the best and It could be better, but its not that trash that the crítica are saying"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,"New York paramedic Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) gains clairvoyant powers after surviving a near death experience. Shortly thereafter, she begins having visions of 3 girls whom she's briefly had runins with before: Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced), and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O'Connor). In all of her visions they're all killed by Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), who has visions himself of his death at the hands of Cornwall, Corazon, and Franklin. His plan is to kill them before they have the opportunity to kill him. I went into this expecting the worst because Sony's Spider-Man Universe has now trained us to expect that; however, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this. I was hearing a lot of negative press going into it but I'm glad it's been better than most of what Sony has offered up to this point. The film does have its faults: the writers could have done a better job at explaining how exactly Cassie gains her powers during her brush with death. In addition, for two-thirds of the film, the only power Cassie has is seeing the future, meaning the rest of the time in order to save the girls from Ezekiel, she's literally just pushing them out of harms way and running away from him. I'm sure this won't do well financially at the box office nor will a sequel be green lit but it does give me some optimism heading into KRAVEN THE HUNTER later this year."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Very mais melhor que Infernal Soldier
"Feb 16, 2024",NEUTRAL,It was a great starter movie for the beginning of a franchise. Buuuut it was anticlimactic. It teased characters that would never actually get to be that great even by the end of the movie. So many unanswered questions especially which spiderverse it was supposed to take place in. I dont know. Dakota makes everything funny. I just wish the plot was thought through.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"I really like the movie, I don't know why everyone say it was bad as Morvius as but I saw the movie yesterday and I know that got some mistakes but it was really funny I think the movie has like that things that the old marvel movies have and I enjoy it very much seriously."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"While there are some problems,Madame Web weaves a fresh new take into Marvel.Even though Emma Roberts was utterly wasted!"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The movie was a waste of time. The story, dialogue, acting, editing, and camera work were terrible."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Estou sem entender até agora o filme.
Tipo, foi feito para quê? Passar vergonha? Joga dinheiro no lixo? Existe uma Rouanet nos EUA?
Bizarro."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Its a solid origin story type of movie, stop complaining just bcs its hot. <3"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,One of the worst movies that I've seen in recent years!
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"This was the best movie I have ever seen (please, they have my family)"
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Great into to Madame Web.  Allow your mind to be free and enjoy the story
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"It may not be Shakespeare, but an entertaining comic book movie."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,I loved it! Really enjoyable if you sit back and enjoy the mystery. Lots of cool action scenes and the acting was super well done. Probably one of the best spiderverse movies in a long time. Hoping we get more of all of the characters involved.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I mean the script was awful, the idea was poorly executed and the villain was underdeveloped. The whole thing was weak and lacking anything to really draw you in. On the plus side I could leave the theater for a snack or bathroom break without any fear of missing anything."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"No post credits
No spiderman
Suits barely shown 
CPR scene was stupid
Villain wasnt even menacing 
It screams ""I want my money back"" after watching it"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie is horrible! worst film of all time. It doesn't even have a reason to exist. Pure deception.
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie was great, all these negative reviews for what? It's not like every other movie? Not like the comics? So what, they took their time explaining how everything happened. It was a great movie even without much action."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Excellent movie.  Will see it again.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It was a rough watch. I don't believe Dakota Johnson sells movies, but she was the only non-awful part of this film. As someone who's had an attachment to Madame Web since I was a kid, it's upsetting to have watched what the studio did with the character. She deserved so much better.

This film was poorly casted, the writing is extremely sloppy, heavily lacked direction, and the production didn't translate to the film. The bits of humor and charisma Dakota showed throughout the movie are what makes it watchable. No one else's acting matched that energy, though."
"Feb 16, 2024",POSITIVE,Dakota is amazing and stunning performance as usual
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Dakota Johnson couldn’t act her way out of a wet paper bag so how she continues to get roles I don’t know. Seeing the trailer at the cinema was enough for me to decide I wasn’t watching this as the trailer was already bad but sadly, I paid for the displeasure of viewing it where there was no escape. We just need to acknowledge she’s not a good actress just because she’s has had decent scripts that have translated well on screen to get good ratings. The irony of her leading  a movie that is associated with Marvel for it to bomb this badly tells you all you need to know"
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I never particularly thought Dekota was a good actress but she's terrible in this role. Overall the movie is slow, under written and poorly acted. I suggest a hard pass"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Okay- not great but also not terrible. Solidly good with some odd choices made along the way. Honestly felt like it would have made a pretty good Disney+ show instead of a feature movie. Dakota Johnson is really pretty from most angles. But nearly everyone in the movie was seriously underacting for some weird reason. Like they had put muscle relaxers in all the on set snacks. A few niggling plot issues- and no mid- or post-credit scenes which now feels like a ripoff- especially since all of Sony’s Spider movies have had them. Better than Mobius. Probably about as good as the Venom movies. Weird Sony is struggling so much with this, since they’ve made some pretty decent Spider-man movies! "
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"You guys remember that Nic Cage movie Next? Yeah? well its like that but with spider-man. Except without the wonky ending where Nic just kinda flashbacks the whole damn thing like it never happened which to be honest I was kinda expecting that. 

Its a popcorn movie. I don't know why people were expecting high art or something deeper than that but. Yeah Comics are weird. It more about the self fulling prophecy of the bad guy where had he just left it to time, accidents happen all the time. 

I have seen worse but this not ending up in my top ten for sure."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Ok, I realize I'm going to be a minority, but my kids and I saw Madame Web today.  My daughter and I thought it was AWESOME!  (Although it didn't have the Captain Marvel and The Marvels type of humor, I really enjoyed the whole show.  I enjoyed the action.  I also liked the caring nature of the main character.  Evan said it was ""ok.""  Although, in general I don't think the guys tend to like the same thing that girls do in ""super hero"" movies.  Just my two cents for what it's worth.  I give it two thumbs up.  (But know I am a big fan of MOST of the female Marvel action adventures.)"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Was a real stretch, even for Marvel.  Gratuitous and obnoxiously high volume too often."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I had to leave after 40 mins, it was all over the place. I was resolved to see it through as I usually do with films I'm not enjoying, but in the end decided my time was worth more…"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madam Web"" falls short of expectations, failing to deliver on multiple fronts. The plot is convoluted and disjointed, making it hard to follow and leaving audiences feeling disconnected from the story. The film leaves gaping plot holes and unanswered questions.

The character development is lacking, with shallow and uninteresting protagonists that fail to evoke any emotional investment from the audience. The performances feel uninspired, with  actors unable to elevate the material they're given.

The direction lacks creativity, resulting in a horrible and forgettable viewing experience.

Overall, ""Madam Web"" is a disappointment, failing to live up to its potential and leaving audiences feeling underwhelmed and unsatisfied. It's a forgettable addition to the superhero genre that ultimately falls flat."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Really hoped this would be good and the critics were just harsh but nope… super confusing plot that made little sense and edited like it was done by 25 studio execs that have no idea how to make a movie. 
Just all around not a good movie and only would recommend if you are looking for the worst movie to watch. 
Plus side is the cast does seem to be trying their best for the most part, Dakota Johnson seems like she's giving her all"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"There is absolutely nothing good about this movie it is the worst superhero movie I've ever seen, and I've watched the Fantastic Four that was made in the 90s."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"How was this allowed to come out?

Seriously, there is absolutely no redeeming feature to this movie. All the main characters are completely insufferable. The plot? is a jangled mess. The acting (if you can all it that) is so mid you would think everyone was chugging cough syrup the whole shoot. It's like someone saw Catwoman & said ""Let's do that!"" It reminds me of the Birds of Prey series from the 00's & that's not a good thing. 

What's even worse, they ham fist the fact it's set in the 90's with the music so hard it's the equivalent of your parents saying somethings ""Lit."" 

It's funny that a movie about a character that can see the future has literally no future as a franchise."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Overall enjoyed the film, was really confused to see people didn't really like it, a overall different take on a spider-man style movie and seems to set up a sequel which I am quite excited for!"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"When Madame Web said ""Love you Web-illion"" I cried and shat my pants. One of, if not a movie ever made in the history of cinema. Right up there with Morbius."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"It's an decent movie, kind  of silly , but it's fun"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The movie is poorly constructed and conceived, I’m not sure any of the actors wanted to be there, the CGI is subpar at best, but I had a blast at the theater. Maybe I watched it the wrong way, but I had a smile on my face the entire time!"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Ummm the main actor guy cannot act and a lot of his words are not properly aligned with his mouth like they did a voice over and just chose not to match them together. Also, this movie could've been cut down to 1 hour and some minutes. It was too long and had a lot of unnecessary scenes that dragged on. I would not ever watch this again. I just watched it because I've seen every marvel movie."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Empty movie theatre…. Makes complete sense…
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"In the famous words of Joe Pesci: 
""What the f] is this piece of sh]"".
Seriously, how did this movie even get made?"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,it one of the worst than morbius it could've been better 1/10
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Absolutely terrible movie. As a comic book fan I loath the corporate stank on these movies. Doesn't feel like the writers or director ever read a comic book.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,The whole movie was great!!!
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,An excellent new superhero movie.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web has the most insatiable appetite for getting things wrong. Maybe the most comprehensive cinematic disaster in my lifetime. Choppy, underdone & laughably absent-minded at every turn. 

You have never read a worse script. The execution is an utter disaster for every second. You've never heard worse delivery. The delivery is so bad you'd think it was done by Evri. We cannot become numb to this treatment. This movie is an offensive sin on the fabric of nature.

As some have said: 'Morbius on steroids!' A fate worse than death. Avoid at all costs!"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I actually found 80% of this interesting as a story, much more so than most recent super hero stories. A few bits not so good if they got cheesy but not knowing the story and not really caring about the original comic aspects, the story was engaging overall to see what happened. Dakota was watchable and I liked her spiky character a lot more than when she had to be super cheesy at the end."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Entertaining and fairly enjoyable … not excellent and definitely some cheese, but nowhere near as awful as the critics score would make you think."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,it's just ok it has some good plot points looking forward to other things in the spider verse
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,I liked it. I can see rotten tomatoes is doing another of there “Marvel Hatchet Jobs”. Gotta wonder whos financing that!
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,The film lacks any sort of cohesion and is more various threads pulled together in a web (no pun intended). There is a lot in the film that could be removed which wouldn't change anything in the overall story or stakes (of which there are barely any) the sheer amount of ADR used in this also makes for a tough watch that made me physically cringe in some moments that were supposed to have weight and impact to them. The only redeeming quality of this film is the source material it is based on
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,I got paid to rate it 5 stars 😂
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,Really not as bad as people said. On the same level as the other Sony superhero movies. Better than Morbius by a mile! 
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie was actually really sweet! I thought the connections to the spiderverse was neat and it was an intriguing origin story.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I thought it was quite well written and the casting was excellent. Dakota Johnson is just fantastic in this role, I've never seen the actor who plays the bad guy before but he is very, very good. I love the storyline, a well rounded explanation of how it began moving into what's going on now. My wife and I both loved it and came out of theater saying we hope they make another one depicting the girls getting their powers and becoming a team but only if they use the same cast. Just an excellent superhero movie and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes superhero movies. Personally, I can't get enough of them."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the movie. Saw it today.

I know there has been a lot of negative comments, however, if they make a sequel as the end of the film suggests. Then they need a whole new team to produce, write."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"What do I have to say, the entire movie sucks."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Still beter than the Marvels.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"What on earth is Marvel doing? This may have been written by a 12 year old. The script, acting, and general filming would have a tough time appealing to a child. Marvel needs to negotiate more with Pepsi on their product placement to get more money to spend on the script. This movie is giving Cats a run for its money for worst film ever. "
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Ass movie. I don't want this to be the next Morbius meme.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Nothing to see in this movie... Plss don't make part2
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Sony!
You're a shitty company with this kind of movies, give up man. Return the rights of spider, no one cares"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining, female lead cast, with special guest - Peter Parker. Don’t let the bad reviews fool you, this IS a Marvel movie"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie is okay for looking on time
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Anticipation for new characters was let down by an oddly executed film. 
While the film did genuinely have some good moments of emotion, good acting, and was interesting to watch the film weave the intricacies of foresight, the logic of putting the story elements together in other areas, was just oddly done. Like “here friend, watch these 3 kids I just met in this house with your pregnant sister, oh and they are in danger…ok!”
The film opened to your unsurprising “jungle search for a special spider” to learn the origins of the main character and how she got her powers, (through her mother in the womb). We don’t learn why her pregnant mother was in a rainforest trying to find a special spider, while 9 months pregnant, until late in the film, used as a catalyst to push the lead character forward to save the day. In the comics Madame Web has a crippling disease and uses a chair. In the film she does not have the disease (but it is addressed in the story), but then strangely the film ends with her in an almost Professor X like wheelchair due to an accident to her eyes in the final battle? Blind people can still walk! Made no sense.
What we got from the trailer was the anticipation of new female spider heroes, when in reality of the film, those were just visions of what will perhaps be in a sequel? Those new characters would likely have been the greatest part to the film, but all we got were snippets of “visions.” The films creation of a Spider-people-jungle-clan (used as spiritual guidance) was an odd element that used a cheesy rewording of “great power comes great responsibility.”
It even annoyingly had moments where there were seemingly audio sync issues with the villain, even appearing to use off camera dialogue and cuts to avoid watching him talk. The film also doesn’t seem to connect with the MCU or even any of the versions of Spider-Man as all of the characters act as if the villain is the first time they’ve ever seen or heard of anybody with those abilities.
Had potential, but was poorly executed."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,To call it a movie would be an insult. To call it a superhero movie would be a crime. Sony should let the Spider-verse guys helm that department and fire the rest.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Esse filme é uma porcaria!
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"So stupid and lazy storytelling, Sony, please stop!"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,Wasn't as bad as people are saying it's mostly ok to pass the time a few action scenes but nothing great! The acting did need some work!
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Movie slightly dragged, but delivered an old school comic book movie. It's on par with movies before the MCU. 

Much better than what Disney is pumping out. But felt like it was the build up to a movie that may never come."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Total waste of time and money.  Story of a superhero who doesn't understand or can use her powers to the end of the movie.  An obvious springboard introducing 3 future superheros  (who couldn't do anything presently but will in future spinoffs.  Blatant attempt just to make money.  The previous MCU movie, (i.e. Eternals) still made money but did not receive generally favorable reviews.  Madame Web is so much worse,,,   Dakota Johnson's talents were wasted, as were the other co-stars.   Adam Scott was excellent.    The story, the villain was pathetic."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,So much potential missed.....
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Filme sem desenvolvimento algum de roteiro. Ele se iniciou super bem e interessante, mas chegou no meio e o roteiro se perdeu. Tudo se tornou confuso e estranho, coisa sem pé nem cabeça. O roteiro nao foi desenvolvido de uma forma que voce pudesse entender o que iria acontecer, ele simplesmente te fez saber o que iria acontecer pq ele repetiu a mesma coisa inumeras vezes. 

Eu nao recomendo nenhum pouco. Poupe seu tempo e dinheiro, nao o gaste com esse filme"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I thought this was great and entertaining.  Definitely above average and why you shud never trust critics.  At first watch, some events seem non sensical but keep in mind she's able to predict future so it does make sense no matter how crazy the action sequences.  Action and story is very coherent.  I was expecting frenetic action that you can't follow like latter Die Hard sequels from reading reviews but nothing far from truth.  The young actresses were great as was Johnson.  Jokes were really funny and frequent so very pleasant indeed."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Who cares what critics say anyways.  The real score to trust is the audience.  And honestly the movie wasn't that bad.   I enjoyed the story of Madame Web and how she really becomes the Madame Web but also I think that's what people need to focus on and not compare it to other Spider-Man films.  Take it for what it is and it is the origin story of Madame Web and I think they did a good job explaining her origin.  It's a fun film to watch.  Especially if you go into it with a open mind.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,leave spider-man to marvel please
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Not like the others super hero movies. A nice suspense drama. Love that they give us a new perspective on Ben Parker.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"As a Dakota Johnson fan since she was announced I knew it would be a love or hate it.  I knew nothing about this character and I loved the fact is a stand alone and don't need to watch other 10 movies to understand.  I enjoyed the idea of her superpower being her mind, and how empowering female super heroes are.  It's amazing to see her explore action movies with a touch of humor. Some scenes seemed weird to me but they made sense for the story in general. Cassie's journey learning about her powers and her bond with the other girl is something fun to watch it."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I agree. It's not the best superhero movie, nor the best origin story I've seen, yet it's still, in my opinion, a solid origin story. It does well to establish the use of her power in this universe as a-whole, yet keeps the mystery of the power's origin as something to explore in the future. I feel like a lot of people/critics are forgetting the basic idea of what a movie/origin story is. It's a STORY. No more, no less. It doesn't HAVE to have deeper meaning than what it shows on the surface. If you can't accept that, I suggest you stop pretending to know how a movie should be (made). But that is just my point of view as a, more than avid, movie watcher/analyst for my entire life."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"By far the most boring a worst marvel movie I've ever seen. With such a power house cast, it was a real shame that this movie was not executed properly. This belongs in the DC universe."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,I liked the subway scene
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Well, it's not a superhero movie with a lot of action, maybe not so psychological deep either but for pure entertainment it is good. I liked it and sometimes it's also nice to watch something which doesn't have full speed all the time. It would be nice with an appearance of Madame Web with her spiders in a future Spider Man movie as a complement."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"After seeing this movie, I definitely believe that critics are conducting a review embargo of this movie; it isn’t as bad as they’re saying! Just as the movie is about manipulating the outcome of events, I now believe that there is something going on trying to manipulate and pull the strings of the public in Hollywood movie success here. 1. Acting - 3.5/5 - most of the cast fell flat in human emotion. 2. Sound - 4/5 - a little inconsistent. 3. Character development - 3/5 - biggest penalty is for not developing the villain more in terms of his why. 4. Visuals - 4/5 - made me believe the settings and I enjoyed most of the visual choices. 5. Plot/story - 3.5/5 - really enjoyed the journey, but there were a couple plot holes or unexplained reasons for things happening as they do. 6. Dialog - 4/5 - basically all of the dialog from the villain is bad writing, but besides that it was solid and believable. 7. Pace - 4/5 - could have been trimmed up a little more but so glad to see this just under two hours. 8. Themes/messaging - 3.5/5 - forgiveness? Protecting the innocent? Healing and moving past trauma? Choosing to be good in a hard world? It’s left unclear the main takeaways and lessons."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"lixo completo, não sei o que dá na cabeça da Sony em fazer um filme desses, mas só tá saindo por que tem gente que ainda gosta."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,pretty good some actors were better than others
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,They had the perfect cast but the script was horrible.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,It is very entertaining. Much better than the latest superhero movies.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,this movie was one of the worse Sony Spider man movies and Morbius is still better then this garbage
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Meh, it passed the time until my next work shift."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Featuring a ""what were they thinking"" screenplay, this is the worst Marvel movie ever, even worse than ""The Marvels!"" It should have the lowest grosses of all Marvel movies ""The Marvels"" holds that record for the moment."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,Not as bad as some people are making it.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Absolute disgrace.. it shocks me how stupid the people at Sony are.. Venom, Morbius now this... someone has to end this! Literally the worst Comic Book Movies ever"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,This had so much potential with characters from a rich mythology and it just falls flat on its face.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Truly, one of the worst superhero-movies ever made. 
The Room and Catwoman meets Neil Breen, The room was a better movie."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"probably the most awkward uncomfortable movie i had ever seen, looks like the spent all there money on actors in a kids movie, how have we gone back this far in progress people?"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,Good Action Superhero Movie with a good strong cast.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"The film is great if you want a relaxed film, the action scene are small, but it's comfortable to see."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Acabo de ver madame web de Sony y funciona bien como una precuela de spiderman. Y 3 cosas:

Hay más misticismo por las arañas y los hombres y mujeres arañas 

El tío ben y su hermana aún que poco; hacen que se sienta conectado con el spiderverse 

Y no; no es tan mala con morbius

Malo: es lo que pudo ser. Los #Trajes de las #Spiderwoman no salen ni un minuto en #MadameWeb lo cual es un timo y un insulto al espectador #Spiderman #Spiderverse"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I am only giving this half a star because the site doesn't allow me to give it five poo emojis. The problem with the movie is...
(insert any issue you could have with a movie here)."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I had a great time with Madame Web and it delivered everything I wanted to see - enough of a divergence from the source material to be interesting but enough callbacks to her comic appearance to please my nerdy heart. I thought it was well paced and exciting, possibly my favorite Spider ""villain"" experience so far."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Es una película diferente a las de marvel, me gustó porque era distinta. Ya cansaba ver a cada rato la típica rutina de superheroe. Me gustó! Dakota Johnson ha mejorado mucho su actuación."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"In an attempt to reel an audience, it instead castaway all hopes fans have for the Sony Spider-Man Universe. Between the nauseating plot, poor voice dubbing, and innocuous acting, this is a new low for comic book movies."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,I really liked this film and can't understand why the negative reviews are so harsh. It's slow moving and the villain isn't as menacing as he should be but loved Dakota Johnson and the strong female cast. Not the best Marvel film but definitely worth a watch & hope they continue the story.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,It wasn't as bad as everyone made it out to be. Some bits were entertaining and other bits were kinda head scratching but overall not bad.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Boring Storyline. Bad effects
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Terrible just terrible waste of money
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"They finally created a superhero whose superpower is causing people to leap over tall buildings in a single bound to get away from movie theaters. It also proves one thing: nobody associated with this movie can see into the future, otherwise they never would have made it."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Sony and Disney Marvel are in a competition to see who can make the worst movie. You thought The Marvels was bad? Sony wins with this piece of hot garbage.

Cringe all the way."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it which means I'm happier than all of you! I win!
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,There was no redeeming factor in this film the cinematography was awful and the dubbing didn't follow the characters lips and the editing was very off putting save your money and wait for streaming.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"First off. Let's just say; I don't want the movie industry, or theatre industry to die. 
I'm very fond of cinema, and  being able to make an event of things, going out to see the newest and greatest that filmmakers have to offer. 
That being said, although I do go to a lot of films since Covid ended, I certainly don't go to see them ALL ""just because"". 
And although I grew up watching Spider-Man cartoons, playing with toys, watching all the live action adaptations over years, I didn't follow the comic books closely enough to learn about all the (Sub-Characters/Stories) and with that being the case, not even really knowing who or what Madame Web even is, or that it was tied into the Spider-Man universe: That was all entirely irrelevant!
I saw many previews leading up to its Valentine's Day premier; and financial aspect of going to see Movie in theatre aside: myself (33) and my two daughters aged (15/10) were more then into checking it out. 
Going into this movie with totally open mind, I can say I enjoyed it!
You don't have to know or follow any of the back story or comics to understand or enjoy this film. 
It's not comic book cliche or fodder like critics have labelled it!! And all the so called (B) or non-A-list actors were phenomenal and did fantastic job. 
From back story, to current day, from scene to scene until ending. There's nothing disappointing about Madame Web, what so ever. Writing. Casting. Performances. Action sequences. All top notch. Thank you Sony, and Crew! 
Would be welcomed addition to see some spin off sequels that include Spider Man/Peter Parker. 
Get out and support good films period."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Very bad, very very bad"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,It was a okay movie but for people who don't know spiderman universe lore would probably be confusing if this is the start of a new spider man universe connecting with the upcoming kraken movie sign me up but if this is it I don't find any reason to watch or come back to this movie in the future
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It had potential to not suck as bad as it did.
I was very disappointed, I really expected it to have more action & more actual ""spidery"" scenes & as a Die hard marvel fan I was very much let down."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"""Madame Web"" struggles with a convoluted storyline that often loses its thread, leaving audiences more perplexed than intrigued. Character development is thinly veiled, making it hard to empathize with or understand key motivations. Despite a potentially stellar cast, performances feel hampered by the script's limitations. Visual effects, usually a high point in superhero cinema, are surprisingly lackluster, failing to compensate for the narrative and emotional gaps. Pacing issues further detract from the engagement, leading to a viewing experience that feels both drawn-out and unfulfilling, marking a missed opportunity in an otherwise rich cinematic universe."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Another one where I don't know what the critics are talking about. Is it the best movie ever, no, but it is good. Starts out quick and continues at a decent pace slowing revealing more details along the way. Not over the top, or a more realistic superhero movie most of the runtime. At the very least quite entertaining."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,¡Asco! Solo perdí mi tiempo
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Went to see the film on 14/02/24 and honestly thoroughly enjoyed the film. The story was enticing, the dialogue was brilliant. One of the top films I've seen in a while. Highly recommend to go and see it!"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"There's no character development in this movie, neither villain or protagonist. Sweeney Sydney,Celeste O'Connor and Isabela Moner are just keep running like an helpless sheep. Actually the movie can still continue without them. Als, the villain doesn't have any attractiveness. He gives the normal bad folks feel. All he does is just keep chasing the protagonists. Weak background info and motion. I just couldn't feel any points that I should fear him. The plot is really boring, zero incentive for me to try it once again."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Totally acurrate to the cómic, good characters but a bad script and that Isnt enought to say ITS a bad movie actually Is quite better than expected"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It really is as bad as they say... BUT... i found myself laughing throughout the whole movie, not for what they intended. It actually was enjoyable to watch for how bad it was. How they turned her into the ""comic"" character at the end is one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,awesome film kept me laughing and such a great period piece
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,O filme  e muito  fraco pouca  ação  história  podre não rende  vilão  horrível  as meninas  do filme fracas quero  meu dinheiro  mais um filme  lixeira da Sony
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was a good movie overall, kind of slow and lacked action for a superhero movie; but it takes you to a well deserved break from all the CGI overload from 16 years of MCU dominating the genre making us dizzy full throttle… good plot and Dakota made a great job!"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"If you thought Aquaman was bad, this movie is atrocious."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It can be disappointing to fall asleep during a film, especially if you were hoping for some exciting parts. Not worth the ticket price 👎🏻"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Dakota and Sydney did great. Celeste and Isabel did a good job. Tahar as the villain was terrible. The script is terrible and cgi is horrendous. I think this could've been decent but it falls as a meh. Still better than Morbius.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Es una película entretenida, dónde vemos a la protagonista como va adquiriendo sus poderes y su liderazgo al proteger unas niñas. El villano que es un hombre misterioso con un objetivo el de eliminar a las niñas ,una película con acción en especial al final y suspenso no saber que pasará."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,More horrible writing and stories..  save your money….  This is the worst Sony. MCU movie to date.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"disgusting movie, need my money back"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,I thought it was good. Like that it was different. Yes some parts was slow but overall I enjoyed it. It's not as bad as what some people or critics are saying. They seem to like the boring and slow paced movies. Stop worrying about what people are saying and just watch it yourself and make up your mind. Be a leader and not a senseless robot.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Las actices son hermosas, la película es muy mala, aburrida"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,I thought the movie was alright.  the story was meh and so were the characters. the costumes  looked alright. not that comic book accurate but good enough. HOWEVER the villain was so bad and trash it made my brain hurt just trying to watch it.  over all its a was of a theater room. use marvel fans cant catch a brake. Hopefully Deadpool 3 saves us all from this Sony hot garbage.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The most generic film ever made, it makes morbius transform and a good film, the script is rubbish, the production looks like money laundering, what saves the film are the actresses."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Honestly I accepted the movie for what it was and enjoyed it more than expected. Took me back to those movies around the time set within the movie of Daredevil, Catwoman, Elektra and Fantastic Four. 

Much better than Venom 1&2"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"One of, if not the worst, movies I have yet to see walking this planet. Visual effects… poor, Acting…. poor. It was a couple of hours I beg I could get back to instead watch the remake of the little mermaid."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,It's just so very very bad.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE, Not a great movie but better than the other Sony Marvel movies
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Most of the storyline doesn't make a lick of sense and at times this movie is very hard to watch. It's a rare instance of the trailer promoting an entirely different film. It's crystal clear that this is not a Marvel Studios project and just ""in association"" with Marvel. The best part was the ending, teasing the audience of an actual good story that might come around if we wait another 2 years."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I'd rather drown in wet paint than watch this movie again. Acting, cinematography, story, all of it a total waste of life"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I felt this movie could have been something big but it appears the director lost their direction and just delivered anything.  No big bad guy, snobby protagonist, not sure who they were targeting for an audience but not the average movie-goer"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,Not as bad as I expected… it's a mess but was semi interesting not a complete flop
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie is so bad it's good, but definitely not worth buying a ticket. Wait for streaming."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I can't seem to understand all these negative reviews toward Madame Web. As someone who loves the spider verse and knowing basic lore about Cassie Web, I enjoyed the movie. From every little bit of foreshadowing it if offered to other spider verse knowledge we have, to the story it built, to the characters introduced. Yes, I'll say Dakota Johnson isn't the most entertaining actress but she has her moments and she did play the role well. I feel like this movie deserves more than it is getting. The comedy was subtle, the drama wasn't bad acting, it was just enjoyable. I left the theater with a huge smile on my face. I was gitty in my seat with every little foreshadow. It's no ""Across the Spider Verse"" or ""No Way Home"" but it is ""Madame Web."""
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I like it, i enjoyed the story line. Had my attention from the beginning. Hope it continues🕸️"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Ehh was kewlno end credit scene 
Way better than morbious"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This has to be one of the worst superhero movies in history, I'm serious this movie is horrible, bad directing, bad writing, bad dialogue, boring and a non interesting story, don't waste your money on a ticket. Sony has turned into a complete joke with these embarrassing spin off films for Spider-Man, Sony should just Give us Spider-Man not these spin off movies , please do better Sony"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I think the movie is not all bad, it had good, very memorable moments, but the plot was so predictable that you already knew where it was going to end and the development felt a little forced"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,No me impresiono pero si es una pelicula muy entretenida.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I know, I KNOW, I'm in the minority here and please spare me the ""You're the only one blah blah blah"" because I don't care. I really enjoyed it. I really had a good time with my fiancée. I liked it WAY better than Morbius"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"The film is not bad, the development of Madame Web is well constructed but it is spoiled by the three girls who have no development and are not really useful. It would have been more judicious to just have just one of the three girls, in order to create a better bond, better character development, and a better final fight. The Villain was too easy to beat.."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I liked it! I would recommend the movie, but don't go in expecting an Avengers movie or even a perfect film, to be transparent with you. 

Don't get me wrong, it had its struggles and needed an actual superhero fan's touch, but I liked how the ""action"" scenes weren't like all other superhero movies, and I could see a pretty exciting sequel come out of it. 

As a fan of the 90's Spiderman animated series, this wasn't my first time being introduced to Madame Webb. I enjoyed the parallels to the cartoon. Unfortunately, it seems the writers took a little too much influence from the cartoon because some of the writing was so cheesy that it could only fit in a 90s cartoon. 

The movie was slow at times, but many movies dealing with multiple timelines/multiverses speed through the framework, and for casual viewers, it's confusing. I think Sony wanted this to be their intro to the multiverse, so I appreciate the focus on the details. 

It does make me wonder how different the movie was before the obvious rewrites and changes post-filming. Maybe they will re-release like Zack Snyder's Justice League. Overall, I liked it, but I hope Sony will start investing in good writers and better directors for future projects."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Not the greatest but had the potential for something big.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,All the actors look like they all want to go home
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"You can tell this is a Sony movie, not a full Marvel movie. It was less than mid and a horrible depiction of the characters. I recommend watching it so you understand how horrible it is.

The main villain had no storyline, and his voice didn't always match his lips when he talked. They didn't explain how he gained wealth after stealing a spider. How does he have a digital image of the three girls when he only saw them in a dream? He could have easily killed all four of them at the end by snapping their necks or smashing their skulls with his feet, but instead, he throws them in various directions so they are hanging on to something and Webb has to suddenly master a new power to save them. His death was so stupid. He's incredibly strong and yet a piece of metal signage was enough to pin him down. Then he falls and doesn't land on his feet? Then more signage falls on top of him and kills him? So stupid.

Dakota Johnson's character was the only one with a semi-complete story. No mention of her dad or grandparents. When she starts having the visions, she goes to all these doctors which implies she's freaked out, but Dakota doesn't look freaked out or act like she's losing her mind. She could have talked with Ben and checked herself into a psych ward then gone through an elaborate escape using her visions to save the girls. Her friend and coworker died and she didn't seem that torn up about it. She stole a taxi and an ambulance with no mentioned repercussions. She called a helicopter to a building she was planning to blow up, and then the helicopter crashed and she killed two people. Also, Webb randomly taught them CPR so they could use it in the storyline to save her life at the end. So obvious, so stupid, so unnecessary. They could have just made the blonde girl know CPR from being a lifeguard or something.

The three girls had no character arc. The trailer made it seem like we would see them mostly in costume with powers. They started as impulsive teenagers who didn't listen to any of Webb's directions -- even though they saw a guy kill multiple police officers and crawl on the ceiling. None of them seemed as scared as they should be. In the end, they were still impulsive teenagers but they listened to most of Webb's directions. Conveniently, all three of the girls have no parent/guardian worried about them. There's no explanation for how the girls get powers -- we can assume it's from the villain's spider.

1.5/5 stars = 3/10 stars"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Not as bad as some people make out. I've seen better, granted, but it's a kids film and a car crashing through a wall and it not breaking the headlights is just as believable as spider venom making you clairvoyant."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Good movie. Dakota and all the girls were entertaining. How Ezekiel audio was off and did not match is voice. Good thing they always cut away when he was talking. But overall good orgin movie and lots a reference to Spiderman.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Dead on arrival. Make Morbius look
Like the Godfather. Almost like they dismissed the fact that audiences have already seen this ""superhero"" movie 19 times over the last 10 years. And then to make it worse, it does nothing to improve on a tired formula except completely exhaust the genre. Meh acting. Lazy script. Silly final act. Not even so bad that it's campy ""good"" It's just flat and vapid of any true imagination or style."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Aaaaand another miscarriage from Marvel-Disney nobody asked for. It wasn't that bad, it's worse. Don't waste your lifetime watching it!"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Buenas actuaciones, escenas de acción y buen prólogo para lo que se venga en el futuro ora Spiderman y su universo de SONY"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,It wasn’t as bad as people say. Yeah it’s not perfect and definitely has flaws but not horrible. Just try to go into it with no expectations
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Horrible in every way. And boring
nothing happens throughout the
entire film. The acting is painful
especially Johnson's. The worst
movie l've ever seen in my life."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Dakota Johnson is worth watching. This is an origin story and had some good elements regarding learning one's superpower though here the action is limited because her power isn't physical.  It could never ever match up with any of the traditional superhero origin stories because of that. The actor playing the villain is absolutely horrible.  Would have been more interesting to see the backstories of the three future spiders instead of being told briefly about them by mere exposition.  Some absurd plot holes in moving things along in this one, but it was worth watching for a departure from the world once again ending and being saved from an overly powerful villain only to be vanguished by overwhelming CGI —errrr, I mean the hero.  This one had great potential for and did achieve some interesting character development via Dakota's skills as an actress but more could have done with her character and the others.  Not a waste of time.  Not the best by any measure."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"very disappointed. It was so cliché, I almost knew what each actor was going to say next. The acting was not very good, and I was just very disappointed. Almost left early on, but decided to see it through."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great Movie, no es tan mala como algunos pintan."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"One of the better movies I've seen from Marvel in a while. It kept me on the edge of my seat. Definitely different from what Marvel/SONY has been doing with the spider verse lately but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It wasn't just about a ""superhero"" who immediately wants to help the world and knows all about their powers. It's the origin to what hopefully will be the future of the spider verse. Can't wait to see what's next!"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Why they have to make Madame Web so young for?
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely terrible, it took my everything to stay awake during this snoozefest."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Missed the mark and tops marvels worst movie yet. The acting wasn't bad, but the story line and ability to keep me from checking my watch just wasn't there. 
The fact they made a cheap attempt to style the Xmen franchise really made this a  truly cheezy movie. 
Wait for streaming, and don't bother pausing if you need to use the bathroom."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It was a bad movie, it felt rushed and waste of time."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Bad scirpt, bad cgi, bad actors."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I am surprised by the negative reviews, I really liked this movie. Granted it was not perfect, but I would recommend it to any superhero movie lover like myself. It was fun and the characters evolved throughout the movie. There were some great action scenes. The villain was predictable and one-dimensional unfortunately, but the heroes were fantastic."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Sony Spider-man Universe is very underrated universe madame web is next hidden gem of sony
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"With the initial reviews I saw, I thought this movie was going to be awful and unwatchable. I was surprised to learn it was at least entertaining. There were some corny parts but it definitely isn't as bad as the 14% listed at the time I'm writing this. I'd recommend seeing it if you're interested but don't have high expectations for greatness. It's an entertaining movie and worth a viewing during a matinee. Walking out of the theater, I liked it more than Morbius and Venom."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Para mi cumplió la espectativa de lo que recordaba del personaje ( en una serie animada que veía en televisión cuando era niña) . Me encantaron los efectos especiales y la conexión con Spiderman acroos the spider verse.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I can't even it was BAD... This is the Wish of Spiderman movies the writing was so BAD The acting was so bad!  this movie made Morbius look good. 
I have only walked out of 1 movie and that was Dreamcatcher this was all most #2 save your money and wait for it to show up free on a streaming service. "
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Worst movie of the 20th Century
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie is so bad on many levels. Sony just said to hell with it and take it as it is.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I loved that it wasn't the usual marvel movie, I loved that Cassie was the hero even though she didn't have the spider-like capabilities, she was just able to see the future!! I also loved the back-story and history of her mother and how she went back to get answers about her mom!! Overall Loved the movie!!"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Disney and Marvel have taken what was, only a few years ago, a beloved cinematic universe, and turned it into a laughable mess. I rarely leave the theatre early but, after the first 40 minutes or so, I crept out and snuck in to watch Wonka. Madame Web is a massive, silly and downright insulting pile of dog poo."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Story feels incomplete. Meh villain.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,That was worse than the marvels. It's like all the sudden every super hero is a 13 year old girl who can't act. Not worth your time. Plus the voice over was so bad I felt like I was watching an old Kung fu movie
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,It's not even meme worthy
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The acting wasn't very good,  I wish I would have waited till it was free.   It was probably on par with The Eternals."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This film is a complete disaster, first the marvels now this film. Disney is destroying Marvel studios"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,My wife and I left after an hour. Boring.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Spider-Man is my ultimate favorite superhero and was excited to see Madame Web come to life; HOWEVER, what the heck was this heap of garbage.  Everything from the story, direction, and acting was absolutely cringe-worthy.  Ezekiel, the main villain, was extremely hard to watch and listen to.  A lot of the time his lips didn't even match the words which made me think they had to go back and do some voiceover work.  The acting from Dakota Johnson seemed extremely forced throughout the entire movie.  I agree with a lot of these other reviewers in which they should have paid us to go and see the movie instead because WOW."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Truly terrible script and some of the worst chemistry I have ever seen on screen, highly recommend if you want to go to a cinema and giggle (hence 2 not 1 star). Went with my girlfriend and she shares the same thoughts. Remarkable amount of fake best friend energy between the three girls, just sell this back to marvel at this point. Highlight is watching people say spider like man or man spider, avoiding the word spiderman like its voldemort."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Saw this with my wife on Valentine's Day after dinner at McDonald's and McDonald's was not the most disappointing part of the evening. There were a lot of little issues that make this movie pretty terrible. There are plot issues. Not to spoil things, but where was that dump truck going to at that speed. The water was only like 100 feet away. A building with there were just a bunch of those little stupid things. Commenting about how small the spider is but the thing was the size of a mouse.

The acting was pretty horrible. Almost like they were given their lines two minutes before each shot. They had time to remember them, but not the time to figure out how to deliver them. The bad guy's dialogue seemed to be completely and obviously dubbed over. One scene was almost like an audio sync issue I get with my TV. 

The real shame is that the cast was a pretty quality group of actors and actresses. It's not the worst movie I have ever seen.  It is definitely no where near the most average film I have ever watched."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,Madame Web is a movie with problems but it is in many ways a return to form for comic book movies. It takes some big swings and seemed to suffer from last minute edits but ultimately I don't understand why people are immediately trashing this film. It's not any worse than Venom and so much less miserable than Morbius.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,oh boy! this movie was hot GAAAARRRBAGE! Avoid this movie spider fans! just avoid it.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Movie was honestly trash , don’t waste your time or money until this streams on a streaming platform. Went to sleep 3 times and when I was watching, the movie went from one plot to another with no context.HORRIBLE and it’s crazy to think Morbius is better than this garbage. Sony do better."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Good movie , excellent character development, ""fans"" have to remember it's an origin story it's not gonna have a trama of a sequel"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Sony! You play too much!! I lost 2 hours of my life with this garbage, Sony y’all should fire the executives who green lighted this garbage ASAP! I think Hollywood is done for! This is sad!"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"O filme não é ruim, porém o roteiro e a ordem dos acontecimentos deixa a desejar. Os atores foram maravilhosos, mas acredito que a direção não teve seu melhor momento."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,solid plot but lacking enough interest. kept waiting for it to get better. potential to to super but fell flat like the whole thing was rushed. C + maybe it was the direction was all over. I wanted to like it more.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,I'm not here to bash anyone ultimately the main screen writers have had mostly duds (2017 power rangers etc etc) and this isn't much different I don't understand why people choose to take a comic book character that no one really asked to see on the big screen and still can't even do it justice you can tell they have not looked into the comics even on bit which means they tried to make a quirky enough random story with a bunch of the industries hottest of the month. And don't get me started on the adr line delivery for a certain character they couldn't even be bothered with.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Elementos ruins, atuações apagadas e roteiro confuso. O filme é umas das piores experiências cinematográficas dos últimos anos. Não dá para mensurar o quanto ruim é esse filme."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"a Spider-Man movie without Spider-Man.. and
Very poorly done. Nothing like the comics. This
Is how you ruin a movie, not how you make a
Successful one. Spider-Man is arguably the
Most popular comic book character today so
Why would they leave out Peter Parker? I don't
Have a clue!"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Decent premise, but Dakota Johnson? The WORST actress on earth."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie wasn decent. I’ll give it a 68-70%. But please guys don’t ever go by reviews .. go see it for yourself  … they rated it a 17% &  that was very incorrect.. It was a decent movie.. its more of a kids movie
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web arrives onscreen barely registering a pulse thanks to a bland script and a cast that's as disinterested as the audience.

"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it. Doesn't deserve the hate it's getting!
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,A film not worthy of anyones eyes.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It's like eating junk food, if the junk food was also coverd in rat poison."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Um ótimo filme que quebra o padrão de sempre por referencias a outros filmes da Marvel. Sendo assim é um filme que não tem conexão com o UCM. No entanto, apesar de suas poucas inconsistências, o filme mantém sua essência. A falta de aprofundamento no desenvolvimento dos poderes dos personagens é um ponto crítico que compromete a coesão e o impacto do confronto final, resultando em uma narrativa falha e pouco envolvente."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"There wasn't much to like sadly. I do remember at one point thinking ""that was cool"". But I have already forgot what that was because the rest was so terrible."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was like morbuios but wow that needed marvel touch up tho marvel ain't helping much
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,La mejor película 10/10
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,I don't know what I just watched.I have seen movies  made by high schools students better edited than this excuse of a movie.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,Honestly not that bad. Little long of a runtime with clunky dialogue but I felt the movie served its purpose ONLY if Sony does right with a sequel. The Ben Parker character was in this more than I thought. I really enjoyed the cast as a whole. Minus the villain.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,The question remains: why do they let Dakota Johnson be the protagonist in any movie whatsoever?!?
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,What happened to Marvel movies? This was terrible 
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Madame Web gets a C - for dialogue and an A+++ for storytelling. The birth of Peter Parker, at the end of the film, is an unexpected surprise. The changes to Madame Web’s origin were very wise and really help put some more meat on the bones of the plot. The dialogue for Johnson and Bishe is really the most meaningful dialogue here, but everyone else’s dialogue is VERY stilted and cheesy, which makes the film drag quite a bit. Some of the decisions made by various characters in this film are laughably stupid and worthy of the critical scorn they have received. The payoff for this film is in its ending, which is very cool. There must have been a better way to execute this film, and introduce Madame Web to the masses than this convoluted mess. Anybody who knows nothing about the character as she’s depicted in Marvel comics, or only knows Madame Web from Spider-Man the Animated Series and the Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions video game is gonna be lost. An omniscient narrator a la Michael C. Hall’s Dexter Morgan would have made the film easier for viewers unfamiliar with Madame Webb to understand. It’s difficult to understand how she’s experiencing the extent of her powers and how to use them more effectively unless you’ve read the source material. The movie assumes viewers have a basic understanding of the character before going in to see the film. It’s obvious from many of the online reviews that most of the critics and fans alike are clueless about the character and unfortunately, the film fails to make viewers sympathetic towards her and to understand her importance within Spider-Man‘s world. Why can’t people admit honestly when they don’t know who a character is, that has been a fixture in Spider-Man mythos since 1980. It’s obvious that most of the professional critics’ reasons for completely lampooning this film have more to do with wanting to see Sony’s cinematic efforts fail in hopes that the studio will sell 100% of the Spider-Man rights back to Disney, along with his pantheon of characters. "
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Dear Sony...PLEASE STOP!!!!!
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Really great movie with a little freshness. I think it´s perfect
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"In a time when superhero movies are everywhere, ""Madame Web"" stands out but not in a good way."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,It's probably one of the worst films yet they aren't even in the suits for that long the main villain just dies and the main character hide blind
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I am no expert . Obviously before watching , I read some reviews about how awful this movie is . However, it is not that bad ."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,I like it when they do something different in a superheroes movie. It not what you expected but wasn't that bad though. Quite a solid film .
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie was so good I really wanna watch it again
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The acting was meh- not the best (almost felt like a voice over from one character). Took a while to get started but never really delivered. Felt poorly executed and forced. There was one part thats amazing, but otherwise, meh."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Just clunky. The editing and writing just felt off. The ADR for the villain was off too, so there were technical issues as well. I really like Dakota Johnson, but this is just a poorly executed movie. They wasted a lot of talent to ""spin"" up a franchise and I just don't want to see anything else by this director. Poorly done."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I don't understand how anyone could have enjoyed this. I watched with my partner and the only times I laughed were when we made fun of it. Story was stilted, dialogue was dry, cgi was fine at best, iffy at worst, not a single character was likeable and their backstories felt rushed. If I could give this 0 stars I would"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,I cant believe this is actually a movie
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Oh my god, this was Morbious level bad.
I mean, I get this was only made to keep rights with Sony but they could have at least tried to get in some cohesiveness in the story.

No chemistry between characters, the funny bits are, well, not and hardly any character - let alone the lead - is even remotely likable.
If this was setting up the for some future Sony SCU... I doubt anyone would be interested.

Just bad."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed this film. Dakota was amazing in it, role suited her really well. Loved the connections it makes to other Marvel films and the twists in it. Don't listen to the rubbish reviews, see it for yourself!"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Definitely, a superhero movie you don't expect - in a completely positive sense. A great change from the shallow and cheap humor that permeates superhero movies lately."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,An exciting watch and a perfect set up for the start of a franchise. Thoroughly enjoyed every second and the sneak peeks of the upcoming heroes. Will definitely be continuing this.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,I loved this film no matter what others say it was a great thrill ride love this film
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Probably the worst movie I ever seen in MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE, BAD EDITIND, BAD SCRIPT, EVERYTHING IS BAD ABOUT IT. 

DONT WATCH THIS MOVIE"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Honestly I enjoyed every second of this movie. It's way too overhated. Even though some of the writing wasn't top of the line, the actresses did an amazing job with what they were given!!! Definitely going to see it again!"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"So bad it's good - But not good enough to give it more stars.

I chuckled my way through many of the ""serious"" parts of this movie. There are some really interesting ideas but the execution just wasn't there so nothing pays off."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,I actually think that this was the worst movie that I've ever seen
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Obvious story, predictable. The voiceover in some scenes was terrible. 
Dakota was solid though."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,One of the worst marvel/DC movies to come out devoid of any love of the source material boring story with zero character development
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,I think everyone hates it because there's no spiderman cameo and that's unfair. The villain was the worst part of this film because of the fact that it sounded like it was dubbed and his lips weren't moving. Besides that it was funny and a different story than what everyone is used to.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Dakota Johnson saved this film..... thanks to her talent and charisma
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"2003 all over again!!! Dakota Johnson, I love your wit, you are naturally so talented! Thank u 4 saving tis movie"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,It was a fun comic book movie. They were able to take Madame Web and make her feel like a big deal within a small story. Definitely worth a watch.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed with watching this with my daughters.. Dakota, Sydney, Celeste and Isabella have great chemistry together. Dakota is so beautiful 😍"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Dakota did a great job so dont blame her
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,A flop! Can I get those 2 hours of my life back?
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Tangled Web of Disappointment: Madame Web Movie Review

I had high hopes for ""Madame Web,"" but boy, did it miss the mark! This movie spins a convoluted web of confusion that even Spider-Man would struggle to untangle. The story is as tangled as a web left unattended in a dusty corner.

The acting is so stiff, it's like the cast got bitten by the wooden acting bug. Madame Web herself is about as expressive as a spider in a rainstorm. The dialogue feels forced, like they were trying to weave a tapestry of words but ended up in a tangled mess.

The special effects are as jarring as a spider crawling up your arm. It's clear they spent more time on CGI spiders than on developing a coherent plot. It's like they got caught in a web of their own making, trying to cram in every superhero cliché they could think of.

After watching this movie, I'm suffering from superhero fatigue so severe, I might need a superhero-sized nap. Save yourself the trouble and don't get caught in this tangled web of a movie."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This is the type of movie that will turn you atheist. If you're already an atheist, this movie will support your theory of there being no God."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,The worst movie I have ever seen. Actors were completely fucked over
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Sydney was one of the reasons this movie has a star. The trailers failed to give what you wanted to see, which was a team of spider-people. Instead it was a 2 hour origin movie that could've been explained in 20 minutes. Terrible writing, but the actors and actresses make it work. A terribly written villain, who only chases people over a thought. I know a lot of people dislike the idea of building up a cinematic multiverse. But when the main character has the power to do so, set it up! The suits were good, that's the reason for the other star. I wish the studio had her powers and saw how the movie would've performed in the future. Maybe they would've changed the outcome of it."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Although the lack luster pre-release hype I went and saw the movie on opening day. I was pleasantly surprised on how much I liked it. It wasn’t perfect by any means but it was an interesting origin story with likable characters and a good jumping off point to other projects. 
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time i hope there is a part 2! Everyone who is low scoring this movie doesn't know what they are talking about! It was an amazing movie!
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,A very decent action packed movie.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie couldn't be more shameless as the Marvel franchise continues to try the make this girl a boss formula that has led to bomb after bomb over the past year-plus. I usually would give movies the benefit of a doubt if they're a good way to kill time, but sitting through this mess is more of a movie enjoyment killer than time killer."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"My sweet Dakota was absolutely amazing! I personally did not need the girls group. 
Go watch it and see for yourself! It's great"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"For a Pepsi commercial it is pretty darn good, for a feature film wow, what a mess , the positives Dakota Johnson has perfect lipstick at times.   The negatives- Pretty much everything , pacing , dialog, story, adherence to canon etc"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Terrible movie overall. The acting was so bad! The score was so boring! The storyline was inconsistent and confusing! The movie was a laughable disaster! I wish I could get a refund!
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,I'd rather drink 2 day old hot dog water than to have to sit through this movie again.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Que filme chato! 
Pensei em dar uma notinha mais alta, mas como teve sites dizendo que o filme teve 100% de avaliação positiva, daí vim verificar e não tinha nem sua do ainda. Essa forçada me fez diminuir minha nota ainda mais. 😞

Achei bem preconceituoso não ter as vovozinhas originais. Seria bem legal colocar nossa brasileira Fernanda Montenegro, ou seja, perderam a chance do filme bombar."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"That had to be one of the most boring films I've ever seen In my life. The dialogue is absurd and despite constant developments - NOTHING ever happens. I almost fell asleep twice watching it but luckily my iced drink would spill and wake me up whenever I briefly nodded off. 

Oh and another Dakota Johnson movie that isn't memorable who would of guessed? Maybe the nepo baby will stop getting free parts for what is an abysmal credits."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,It wasn't that bad the story wasn't there but the whole film is comic book look like everything from the Madame web comic was in this film not much of the superhero suits but it wasn't that bad I give it a rating 5.4/10
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"No se sabe si reír o llorar de el horror de película, muy mal contada, mal editada, malas actuaciones. A quien se le ocurrió que Dakota Johnson podía hacer este tipo de películas. Actuación muy insulsa"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Es para reírse de lo mala que es
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"horrible, very bad performances"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A generic, soulless movie with flat characters and bad acting. Only enjoyable parts were that one funny scene and those nostalgic 2000s songs."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Sony needs to stop with these Spider-Man spin off films because they're making the hero and the MCU look bad. This Madame Web character should've never gotten a movie to begin with because she's just a lesser known supporting character.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"You can't keep having Spiderman movies without Spiderman, I understand Sony has to make a movie to keep the rights but please just let the rights go. This is causing harm to humanity."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Madame Web is one of the better Spider-Man character origin stories. Directed by S.J. Clarkson who directed the Jessica Jones series, this film is very well paced it doesn't try to be a set up to another film. Dakota Johnson carries this film on her shoulders with very good performance playing the paramedic Cassie Webb with such straight deadpan humor, a great supporting cast including an exciting Daniel Brühl style villainous performance by Tahar Rahim, and a riveting score by Johan Söderqvist. It's a great dark standalone thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat in a way that's more interesting than The Marvels and Ant-Man: Quantumania"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Si pensamos que está película iba a salvar a Sony, que equivocados, muy mal todo. La dirección, el guión y las actuaciones muy pésimas. La protagonista no expresa nada a su personaje"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Solid story line all in all. Beautiful origin for Madam web, accurate Madam Web from 1999 cartoon. Great standalone family movie.  I hope she ends up in a future Spider-Man film."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"If you're a die hard fan of the comics this might not be what you want it to be, but overall I thought it was a good movie and a good setup for future movies"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"What a travesty... bad acting, bad story, bad everything, Sony please give up the spiderman universe without spiderman and focus on something else."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Who cast Dakota as an action hero?
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,doodoo fr sony just give up lmao
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Disappointing, underwhelming, frustrating are some of the best ways to describe this film, thankfully the cast did their jobs pretty well."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,Not as bad as everyone made it out to be. Just lower your expectations and enjoy it for what it is.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Well, nothing is perfect, Madame Web have at less good action scenes, for me is in The category SO Bad That is good"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Sony's attempt at moneygrab which failed miserably.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Excellent Movie. Really enjoyed it
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Started off extremely excited to check this one out, unfortunately from the voice over fake accents to the non believable teenage wannabes, to the overly placed PepsiCo branding, man what a disappointment. The costuming could have been so much better but it just wouldn't have been able to overcome the absolute terrible acting. Zero stars if possible."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,WTF DID I JUST WATCH ??? Are you serious Sony ?? Stop screwing up the Marvel comics smh
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,It would be one star but the cringiness made me laugh. I would wait till this movies is out & you don’t have to pay to watch it. I’ve watched a lot of there super hero movies but this one was crazy. The camera movement was terrible. The movie itself was questionable. I feel like this movie had potential but it was wasted.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Meh sums up my feelings about the movie, you know? Don't get me wrong, love these actors, big fan of the Spider-Man world, but this one just didn't hit the mark for me. I waited and waited for that big moment, that crescendo, but it just never landed. I suppose setting the bar too high going in was the problem."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Was this the best movie ever made? No. Was it the worst? Absolutely not. It was a decent film that kept my attention and passed the time. The acting was surprisingly decent (as good as it can be with the script) and there were a few cheesy/eye roll moments, but overall worth a watch. Ignore critics and decide on your own."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,This is not the worst superhero movie I have seen. Lots of great cast members and funny moments referencing 2003. Go in with low expectations (or a high state of mind) and you will have a fun time at the ridiculousness that comes with the superhero genre. I think the movie starts out strong too. No end credits scene which is a bummer.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The movie feels like a product of the early '20s when superhero movies were still finding their footing. It suffers from stiff acting, characters lacking chemistry, inconcise plot elements, a certain TV show feel, odd editing, slow pacing, and some very peculiar choices overall. Somehow, it feels soulless."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,The Bots on this page saying the movie was in any way good is insulting to ppl with even minimal intelligence. RT obviously has no integrity.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,What did I just watch?
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I had seen the trailer for this movie already before watching it. I went in knowing what to expect. I had also done some reading up on the character that is Madame Web and the powers we'd be expecting her to have being aware that this wouldn't be your typical action-packed Spider-Man movie. But I was still curious to see how Madame Web would utilize her powers to counter the mysterious new bad guy who did have physical super powers. 

The writing could've been better. The lines (if they were from the script directly) definitely could've been better. ""Sometimes, sacrifices have to be made for those you love."" And ""with the responsibility comes great power"" or something like that. These references and quotes that were supposed to mean something in serious moments just came off as corny and really not memorable. 

In terms of the filming, the only negative that really stood out to me was one of the early scenes. Constance was interrupted during her photograph session by her baby. The snap scene to her bending over was extremely unnatural. 

Outside all of that. I actually didn't mind the story and the rest of the movie. I think Dakota Johnson was a pretty good fit for the character. I did go into the movie hoping that she'd be able to avoid the fate of her comic book state (blind and locked into a wheel chair) but unfortunately that still did end up happening. 

The villain, Ezekiel. I can't seem to isolate if it was his acting or the scripture that portrayed him. But it did leave me wanting for more of a challenge. I wasn't too satisfied with the evilness of his deeds. His character was a bit too 2D, I wouldn't have minded a little more depth to his villainy."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,The acting was so bad I couldn't wait for it to end. The writing was so cringe. They were right when they said it makes you almost angry at how bad it is.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie is a must watch! Magic spider people!!! Birth of Peter Parker! Sony is wild doing this crazy thing! This will 100% beat Deadpool this year!
Best part is how they ignored every comic ever made and just did their own thing! Literally no one asked and yet they still did it !"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The movie is not nearly as bad as the critics are claiming it is. Sure, there are some things it does poorly. The actions scenes are poorly edited and the acting and dialogue are pretty poor for the most part. But the story was pretty solid with some creepy stalker/horror vibes going on, along with some intentional (and unintentional) humor that kept it entertaining. I think there would be a lot more potential in a sequel since it ended with a very solid setup for a movie about a team of teenage spiderwomen that could be reminiscent of teenage mutant ninja turtles (with Madame Web as their sensei who guides them with her clairvoyance.)"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Who hired the directors this movie is just a cash grab and you will have a better time watching paint dry or watching morbius
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Straight garbage, anyone who dares rate this above 1 star has zero clue what true cinema is and let alone know anything about comics. Worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life. The script was dull, editing was basic. Definitely don't recommend anyone to watch this."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"As they lied to the actors, they lie to us in the same way. It could be said that this is the extended trailer; the effects are horrible, even though the story would be very good if it were ""Final Destination,"" but nooo, it has the Marvel seal :(, remember that this movie has nothing to do with the MCU."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Movie was absolutely terrible. Who seriously green lighted this movie. This movie is a disgrace to morbius.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,It’s not bad. Go see it
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Not as bad as expected even though there's a few tangles in this web.

I thought the story was simple and straightforward, also had a few nods to spidey fans and fun action sequences throughout the movie. I do like the further exploration on Cassie's abilities but it just came across too dull.

I think the villian was pretty disappointing, boring motive and the voice over on the actor was soo poorly edited which shouldn't be surprising as the rest of the movie has some moments on slipping up on there editing. The dialogue between the 3 girls was too cringy and the story leaves too much of a mess on whats to be there origin story. 

This may not be the answer to making the Sony verse better, but it still has its moments on being a fun popcorn flick."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,A great storyline and script that leaves you wanting more and grateful for the message of the movie.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Best marvel movie I've seen in ages. Ignore the stupid critic reviews, they don't have a clue what they are talking about. Completely straight forward/ easy to understand story (even my old man who knows nothing about superheroes couldn't understand why critics are saying tangled mess), entertaining, funny and actors were great."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,I’d give it zero stars if it was possible. Horrible movie.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"A super hero origin that follows many of the tropes. There's a reluctant hero who starts realizing she has special abilities, and ultimately she answers the call. A villain that is fairly lackluster and imitates the abilities of the hero. While these elements keep the movie from elevating to something more, I don't really hold them against the film because what's the rest was different enough and interesting. It's still cool to get more films focused on female heroes. It's still fun to see nods to other spider-verse properties. It's interesting to see the main characters literally be hunted as the main driver of the film. I have some other gripes, like awkward cinematography at times and some instances of characters telling us something that would have done better with subtlety (the CPR scene in the motel comes to mind), but overall, I was satisfied with the end product."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Being a superhero and comic fan it pains me to see Sony, yet again butcher one of the best superheroes of all time, Spider-Man. It's never good when you have a Spider-Man universe without a a Spider-Man in yet alone when the movies aren't good. I feel bad for the actors in the because I like them all but this movie wasn't at all it. The story and cinematography wasn't good there are so many plot wholes to where this fits into the Sony universe. Overall just a mess of a movie"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Dakota perfect as a Madame Web, good Origen history. Hope she back in Spider-Man project."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,This was absolutely the worst movie I have watched in the last 5 years.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,Es una buena película si no es la mejor tal vez porque todos querían ver ala anciana  que conocemos pero  esta padre me gusto  y pasear de ser la única que tiene poderes  y que hay wecos vale la pena darle una oportunidad  en serio  . Gracias
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Not only me but a lot of my friends enjoy it ! I guess it doesn't please the basic audience or the reviewers here but I definitely recommend watching it in the cinema.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"After all the fail attempts of Sony's movies, i really enjoyed madam web. I think the casting choice was amazing. Really reallly was looking forward to the action scenes of the girls but understand the plot and the reasons behind everything. I hope this gets a sequel or pulled into the mcu. Had a great time and was locked in the whole time"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"The story is very good. The 4 actress make a great first appear in the movie. I like it. Please, connect with all MCU"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I respect Dakota Johnson, she wasn't bad..but the movie was really cheesy. If you want a women's superhero movement , you better be smart about who your supporting cast is going to be."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Upon first viewing, this movie is not bad, and it certainly doesn't represent the current 17% RT score. Sony has always impressed me with their technical proficiencies, thus, the visual style and fx along with the excellent score and sound design are very interesting and well executed. 
The performances of the actors are great, in my opinion, Dakota Johnson totally steals the show and manages to turn any amount of plot insanity into something that is believable. And even Adam Scott absolutely kills it as a side character. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor also give great performances that all attempt to lend more dimension to their characters, sometimes successfully, sometimes not.
Which brings me to the film's drawbacks. The plot is at best fairly clumsy, some parts are incomplete, the structure feels uneven and is often confusing. I'm not sure if the problem is the script, story or the editing. If there were specific problems with any one of those elements, I feel they could be excused, but there are problems with all of them which leaves us with a bit of a mess with a few too many holes. 
Overall, I don't dislike this movie, it is excellent to look at and listen to and Dakota Johnson gives us a worthy introduction to an excellent character from the comics, I truly look forward to seeing her again at some point. Sadly, I don't feel inclined to watch the movie again any time soon. The issues, which I assume to be caused primarily by unwelcome studio executive interference, really block the character of Madame Web from having the unique and excellent movie she deserves."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"It's a really fun movies, it feels like the Marvel movies before the MCU and I was missing that feeling. It's not like it's my favorite movie, but a movie to have a fun time. The characters are great, loved the dynamic. I recommend it!"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Bad writing, halfway decent plot idea. It's a bad movie but definitely watchable.

The dialogue was cringe at times and there were more than a few continuity errors. I would have cut out a large chunk of the important scenes."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Got into the action very fast and a new fresh take on superhero's instead of just run and fight
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Unique take on the the Spider man legacy. Intense, enertaining, an funnyl"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"If I could give it more stars I so would, absolutely. 20/10 recommend this movie to anyone who’s been waiting for the perfect female Spider-Man. Spider-Gwen doesn’t really count because she’s her own entity. The storyline was superb and everything connected so good that my mind was blown. Got literal chills every 5 minutes which never happens when I watch movies. Go see it right now!"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I'm not sure why people are giving this movie such a bad wrap! Yes it had its moments, but overall, this movie was great! The storyline was there, and it left for a great continuation of the story, as well as great character development. Stop hating!!!"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Honestly, I expected a lot more, the girls did absolutely nothing, they just followed orders and never took initiative to help. The villain had no purpose for doing things, it is clear that he is bad because yes, they did not explain where he comes from either."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,I want my money back
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,Interesting take on the character. Well worth the price of admission for the talent and action presented. Could be a great start to the spiderverse.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Aewsome Job! Loved it!
Madame Web reminded me of the 90s 
Spider-Man cartoon"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,omg i dont think ive ever seen such a bad movie like the acting is so cringe throughout the whole movie you keep pausing to yourself like dang this is awful
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,Shitty acting from villain could be funnier but solid watch
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Sony needs to sell the rights to Spiderman to Disney so we can get better spin off movies. I loved Dakota in Suspiria (2018) she was casted incorrectly for this movie and frankly she deserves to be in better films.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I lost a bet and had to go see Madame Web by myself on Valentine's Day. I was a couple minutes late, and accidentally went to the wrong showing, walking in half way through. I only realized this when the credits rolled after 1 hour of sitting down. As painful as it was, I felt like I cheated the bet, so I walked over to the correct showing of Madame Web, that was also half way through. It was only during this second viewing of the second half of Madame Web that made me realize what an absolute masterpiece this was..."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Boring, Boring, Boring....

Sub-par performances and story telling."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Absolute must watch! Loved the story, loved the action, even cried a little in a couple scenes. Sure it's not for everyone, but if it's for you, you'll laugh, cry and cheer."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie was great, the people sitting around us  not so much"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great movie, perfect beginning to a great film series (hopefully). I loved everything about it, 4stars because at times the pacing was off like having short parts that needed to be longer or long parts that should've been shorter. Regardless, great movie overall. It surpassed my expectations by 1000."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Madame Web stands on its own as a decent installment to Sony's Spider-Verse, that being said it wasn't awful but there were small I didn't like, all in all though, solid film"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Terribly written and produced. Some humor landed, but not enough to make up for the price of admission."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,worst movie I’ve ever seen
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not bad but not good, it’s just there."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Star Wars is a great series and I love how they did yoda in this movie. The lightsaber fights in this movies were phenomenal and the cgi for the nonhuman creatures was amazing. I really felt it when Darth Vader said “I am your father”. Madame web on the other hand was absolutely horrendous
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Horrific. Like actually so bad it can't be humorous. Terrified that anyone thought this could lead to anything, especially if those people are execs. Absolutely garbage."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The movie was absolutely terrible, cringy and deserved a way better story, start to finish lazy writing"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Madam Web left me lost in its convoluted mess. The plot felt more like a made-for-TV drama than a gripping movie experience. Save yourself from this web of nonsense.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie is horrible. The acting, the lack of a functioning plot line, and the director are all to blame for this flop. It should have been so much better."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,honestly the worst movie i've ever seen
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"The action, the group effort to work together!"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A movie with three extremely interesting and cool spider-people who in the end (spoiler) are not gonna become spider-people in the actual movie. Talk about false marketing. 
The villain had no real motive nor backstory. The acting was flat and there's just so much potential wasted by Sony once again. This is an origin story without the actual origin."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,better than people are saying but definitely not the best
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Excelente filme e não sou crítico por isso mesmo que você está falando sobre mal do filme só tenho uma coisa a dizer vai ver outra coisa deixar pra pessoas aproveitar experiência tem tanta coisa na vida pra fazer um filme povo parece que entra em guerra com isso e triste fazer o que essa nossas vidas agora
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Could've been more but in my opinion it was good! 👍🏼
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It had potential until the three annoying bad acting girls showed up! Then, It went downhill. Movie didn’t make any sense. It was awful!"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I was going into the movie thinking the critic reviews were harsh and not fair, however I realized they were 100% in saying the movie is a miserable train (ambulance) wreck. This movie can be summed up in one word; DREADFUL"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Good movie to watch with your family. It's not bad, it's entertaining I would say it's okay."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Other than a horribly acted main villain and a few plot holes I thought the movie was entertaining enough and a good origin story for madame web
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Decent story, acting was meh. Has potential."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Ohhh my!Not only was this Straight Trash it was also the reason I went straight home and drank a bottle of moonshine!Terrible from start to finish. Sony & Marvel should be ashamed of themselves for supplying such garbage to the big screen. I wouldn't buy this on bootleg from the guy in the Walmart parking lot.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It's a no go. This is by no means a marvel movie. I understand it's not part of the MCU, but this was absolute garbage. Storyline was horrid. Actors were decent, but holy s***. Do not feel a need to watch this film. Wait for it to come to streaming or simply don't waste your time and money at all."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The acting was pretty bad. It had the potential to be a good story, but it really wasnt."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Had hopes for this movie. Went in thinking that if anything it might explain what's going on with the rest of the Sony Spiderverse movies. Was severely disappointed. Came out like a c class movie and every plot point hit like sandpaper on an open wound. I would not recommend to anybody.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Wasn't bad, just needed a little bit more to it. A few spots had me excited, but they had a hard time following thru and keeping it going. If you know anything about the characters from the comics, Johnson was excellent as Cassandra."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"no estuvo tan mal , solo que pudo ser mejor , el detalle es que no se cambios le hicieron al guion de acuerdo dakota johson, tiene buen elenco pero no las aprovecharon lo suficiente , tal vez no este conectada entre las de spiderman o avengers hasta ahora, solo el origen del personaje, pero si tiene secuela que hasta ahora es desconocido, puede mejorar"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Movie was honestly really good, rotten tomatoes critics often don't know what a good movie looks like, in my opinion never trust what they say and always just go and watch it for yourself and form your own opinion. They gave this movie a 16% but it deserves way higher."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining. It was funny, nostalgic, and moving. Good job everyone."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Save your money.
Watch paint dry, it has better character development"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this movie. Go watch it for yourself. Maybe not  the top $$$ paid actors you wish you wish for, but they all did capture my attention and kept me engaged."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"No exaggeration, the worst film I’ve ever seen."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie was great !
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Slow and kinda pointless. Left with more questions than before I watched it. Get ready to see more plot armor than you’ve ever seen! Smh 
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I'll be honest without spoiling the entire film.  IMO, it's an origin story, but the trailer is very miss leading.  Lots of teasers and easter eggs, but not a lot of what the studio uses to lure you in with the trailer."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was okay but no real plot.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,Not bad but could have been better.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,hits nostalgia and is not as bad as they say
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie. Dakota was outstanding.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great movie, looks like potential for a second one in the future."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Very underwhelming   Expected more from Sony tbh
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,I liked the girl power.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"If you rated this anything lower than 4 stars then you shouldn't be allowed to rate things. Most of you aren't even real fans and just want something to be negative about, well that's what X is for. This movie was better than expected and actually had good fight scenes with a great story. Easter egg with Peter too, the one bad part was that they left the End Scene credit out."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,it was great at some points in the movie. as a marvel fan I didn't really love it or enjoy it as much. i feel like it was not worth the time to watch it personally. some people's opinions may differ but I most certainly think that this film could've been better since it was a marvel production.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"AWESOME!!! Wished there were more superpower scenes. but great origin story, overall."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Not a superhero movie.  Sucked beyond belief!
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The Worst Superh...... whatever movie EVER!!
A complete messsssss."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"being a massive fan of Dakota Johnson i had to see this film  . even though this film was very slow building and some of the plot didn't make sense , i did enjoy it particularly the cinematography . i feel it was the right cast but just the script didn't really do it justice to what it could be . i am hoping there is a sequel as i still enjoyed it but get better screenwriters as the story felt a bit pieced together ."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Very entertaining movie. Will make a Madame-billion dollars.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,The writing and acting was SO BAD.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"O filme é bom, poderia ter explorado mais a ação aranha."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It is not that bad, you can enjoy a simple and fun story. The movie did not try explain too much, just put some characters in a bowl and add the most simple story line that they could."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Must see! Many points in this movie obvious and so I’m not so obvious, but I don’t wanna give spoilers it connects many movies, and is the foundation of what’s to come.  The acting, affects and everything else around. The whole movie process were top notch. This is a much-needed movie for our universe as well as others in the multi-verse."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,I wanted to die watching this movie. Like actually rather just die than sit there and watch it.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Ayo, lemme get this straight.. 😭 So, shawty got hit by a firework..underwater..& THAT blinded her??! Cmon bruh. This director should retire & live off grid for the rest of eternity. I’m appalled I was scammed into spending more than a nickel to see this movie. Not 100% positive, but I believe I woulda rather been buried alive."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie kept me entertained and asking questions. Overall, I enjoyed it."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's a good film to take on a new character. It's really a side story. I don't see how to integrate it into a Spideyverse. It's not the film of the century but it's a good film to see, especially for comic book fans"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Considering all things, it is not that terrible, not that great either. I love the apperances of actors I wouldn't expect in a marvel movie and Dakota Johnson is alright. What I didn't like is the writing, at times it was alright but at times it was terrible. Why does Sony do this though is a great question. There is potential within the movie I suppose but Sony being Sony."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,i liked the movie. i might have to watch it a second time to fully love it. Dakota Johnson did spectacular so did the girls in the movie.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,it's a good movie if you like a thiller/slasher movie and don't care about the origins of madame web. besides that it was enjoyable to watch.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,One of the worst movies Ive ever seen
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Don’t watch this bs, Spider-Man didn’t even pop up, flashbacks was goin crazy whole movie, Im still confused tbh."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I honestly enjoyed it. There was a couple of parts where the cgi sucked, but other than that I enjoyed the story."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"amazing movie, definitely worth it. I will spend money to get a hard copy of this film"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"ok movie. still bummed why Sony doesn't let Marvel studios handle all the Spider-Man related characters and Sony can still produce the movies, but under Marvel studios's creative direction."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Crazy how they changed the Uncle Ben quote to him getting it from a fortune cookie then having Madame Web change it into something worst.

The red carpet pictorial was better than the whole movie."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie sucked ass.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,They disrespect Spider-Man! Stop making Spider-Man spin offs!
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Can't believe this is a Sony movie. Worst superheroe movie ever, feels like a fan made bad movie."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Yes, it really is that bad."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the fresh take on the story and building out the universe with more characters
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Good movie don’t listen to critics
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,decent family movie. simple yet entertaining. good origin story. looking forward to Madam Web's next appearance & sequel. don't go expecting a big scale Marvel superhero movie
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,This film is a snooze fest. Wooden dialogue. The lack of character development to care. Very little action in this movie. I don't think there is.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I wanted this to be good as I love Dakota Johnson, but sadly it wasn't very good.  She was the only actress/actor I liked in the film though.  Solidifies the 50 Shades movies as better which is not praise.  I think Dakota should do more serious films than stuff like this. 

I also am familiar with the comic book characters and nothing felt right about that aspect, but going in, and based on movies and TV shows Disney and most other studios have done of late, I wasn't expecting it to be.  I was mostly going for the acting and to judge how the director framed shows and transitions, but nothing stood out.  Even the soundtrack lacked but again no surprise there either.

Also, why did this come out today? It's not a Valentine's Day movie in any way. I miss a decade ago when we got films like that. Now we get this."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I am a film critic for the greatestmovies.com now I haven't seen this movie yet, but this looks like the greatest movie ever made next to Morbius? Now I see a lot of reviews that were horrible movies, but got five star reviews so I'm trying to level the Field!"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Dakotah Johnson sounds like she is about to cry for most of her lines. I feel like the industry peppers her in places to see where she might fit without asking the audience if it works. She is not a comedian and she is not an action star. There is just way too many corny lines that watching this was painful. This movie was a non-starter. Maybe go back to having focus groups before giving us a movie we didn't ask for.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"al principio de la película es interesantes pero hay muchas ecenas con malos efectos especiales,forzadas y innecesaria como cunado regreso a peru y la trama es simple y repetitiva"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Was it written by an eighth grader?
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"if you're considering watching this movie as i was just a few hours ago, i strongly advise you to rethink that insane idea. this is the single worst piece of cinema i have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. the dialogue is laughable and full of meaningless conversations. even Dakota Johnson couldn't save this train wreck. yeah, just don't do it to yourself, i'm BEGGING!"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not the worst Sony-Marvel movie actually, but ""Madame Web"" is a mess, strange, and weird movie. The plot were boring and it's not the superhero movies we expected to see. Sydnee Sweeny plays Julia good."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed the movie. Isn't meant to be a masterpiece like the critics and the pseudocritics desire, it's just a good superheroine movie with a great story, a great cast and GREAT 2003 soundtrack. Let aside the hate of the internet and go see the movie and have fun. A movie don't need to be always a Oscar-worthy, movies are also about fun! I hope we get a sequel of Madame Web."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Read the critic reviews before seeing this and I think they were off. A lot of criticism about the pacing and movie being slow. I would argue the slower pace was what made this movie better than newer Disney Marvel movies. Too many superhero movies rush from action scene to action scene without developing characters. This was a return to the original formula of getting to know a character and watching them develop their powers. Really liked it and I didn't find it boring. There were thrilling moments throughout the film. Definitely like Sony Marvel more than Disney Marvel these days.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"SJ Parker is a tv director who has never created a show (besides mistress which was terrible) never written a film script or had to do anything original at her helm and it shows. Dialogue is so bad. The shot selections are idiotic and take you out of the movie. She kept adding lines explaining what the characters were thinking when it was obvious. It's like she thinks the audience is mentally disabled. Studios need to hire talent female directors that have proven themselves not this. I hope she is never allowed to make a movie again. Stick to basic cable. She was unqualified and clearly never read the comics and it looks like she hates comics. It was almost like she was making fun of comic book stories. Shockingly horrible. No one should watch this. The poor actors were trying so hard to save this movie but couldn't. Could have easily been an awesome movie,"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The story line is everywhere, so confused at the end, there’s so many holes in the film."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Una película muy buena y digna de ver para los que están involucrados en el spiderverso ya que el origen del personaje está bien explicado nunca mencionaron que era sobre los personajes en acción sino del origen yo me quedo con los datos curiosos como el origen de la frase de un gran poder conlleva a una gran responsabilidad
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed the movie!
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Previsível do começo ao fim, mas prendeu minha atenção. Personagens cativantes. Eu comparo Madame web a Doutora Estranho no multiverso da loucura, O qual eu também gostei bastante por ser previsível."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Looking for the next……..
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"What an embarrassing, steaming pile of diarrhea"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Ending gave me chills can’t wait for more of madame web
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Madame Web deserves better...
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,It is like seeing an old-school superhero movie seasoned with suspense. Great cast! It is a must for Sony to connect with any spider-verse.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it even though it was a bit slow at times.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,I wasn't expecting much after the low critics scores but I don't know what movie they were watching. This is one of the better Marvel films that has come out in the last couple years. It was very intense. The action was very thrilling IMHO. All the ladies did great in their roles. And the villain was one of the better antagonists I've seen in a marvel film in a while. I highly recommend this movie.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"No esta feo, está interesante , mejor que las de Marvel de ahorita :v Sony se toma enserio los de súper héroes ♥️ @starlordmarvelito tiktok"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"A refreshing thriller with lots of action l. It felt like the same pace of the series loki, left us wanting to watch more but also satisfied. Can't wait to see what else they create out of this universe with more spider girls."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,This was such a good movie. I seriously am starting to simply despise all movie critics as being bandwagon jumpers.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Not a bad addition to the Marvel Franchises but I would have liked the overall story either be focused on just Madame Webb or a full blown origin story for all four main characters.  As it was, the flashes of their futures was lacking.  I did enjoy the film and will most likely watch it again when it is released to streaming."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I think it's a pretty good movie. Definitely a bit corny in terms of dialogue and moments. Some issues with audio and visual recording, mainly with the antagonist. The writing isn't top tier. However, it's still a pretty good movie. I feel that more good outweighs the bad. It works as an origin story, and I'm pretty excited to see where they go with it."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,That audience score can never even be right.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It has potential. Unfortunately, it’s all over the place and the storyline is low  key bad.,"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Wow! Blown away! Amazing movie!! 5 stars!!
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I don't understand why the reviews are so low. Even though this was by Sony it finally felt like a Marvel movie. It was slow at times but the storytelling was absolutely phenomenal. The acting was on point. Marvel finally got back to storytelling which is always the strongest part about Marvel. Go see the movie and ignore the critic reviews, this is a great movie. The Easter eggs in this movie were phenomenal. I can't wait to see see this spider-verse really get going"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Corny any overall boring.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,This film started out well but seems out of place in the grand story. I don't recommend based on this story being completely irrelevant.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"They just don't make movies like this anymore! It's some of the worst directing and campiest acting you've ever seen, but the movie is very self aware and consistent in its voice. It's a breath of fresh air in a world full of repetitive origin stories and superhero movies that all have the same ending. Can't wait to see the sequel!"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Over acted, felt dubbed and unintentionally corny"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,I don't understand why people hate this film. It's good.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,No fue lo que uno espera muy decepcionado por la trama 😭😭
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,My family and I loved it!
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I wanted it to be good - the writing, directing, and acting was awful"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I haven’t seen ALL the Marvel movies, but I’ve seen most of them and this is by far the worst. The bad guy is just poorly dubbed half the time, and this even happens for the main character Cassie a few times. The story is half-baked and makes very little sense.Don’t see this."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Movie was great! The story itself was very cool, the way they portrayed Madame Web's powers was awesome, and the villain was also very cool. I will definitely see it again!! :)"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Normal movie it amazing for me cause madame web begin for everything of spider web.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Its a train-wreck. So much bad its hard where to start. The villains acting stands out to me as most terrible.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,I loved it.  The action was good.  Johnson did an awesome job playing madam Webb. I liked how realistic it was and the storyline.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,This is a begin Hero when you were seeing the movie in period same of amazing spiderman and I want to see next more.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Let me start off by saying this is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This movie was shameful. The story goes nowhere, the characters are bland and uninteresting, and the dialogue is complete and utter garbage. Anyone who leaves a good review is either lying or has never seen a movie before. I'd like to personally let the writers directors and editors that they have reached their low point and should find a new profession. There is absolutely no care put into the characters. The acting in this movie might be the worst part. Adam Scott was the only one who actually delivered lines well, though he wasn't given much to work with. If you or someone you know worked on this movie, please seek help. You have made the biggest pile of trash I've ever seen. Disgraceful."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The movie was good, not great. I think that the concept alone is a cool idea but not executed well enough when it should have. An enjoyable movie, that I'm assuming is setting up something for the future. Not much action or fighting at all and the girls were never suited up other. Villain was okay, nothing special . Would rewatch it again in the background while doing something. And would wait to stream it ."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Horrible voice acting for a lot of the film. Story falls flat every time it tries to pick up. Bad cuts. Terrible & highly noticeable lip sync issues with Ezekiel for the entire film. Special effects/ editing has its good and very bad moments. Entertainingly bad.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,I like this movie cause normal timeline in NY2000. not over hero
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Don't waste your money.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Hearing people walking out of the theaters 30 minutes into the movie says it all.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Far from great but far from terrible too. The script is weak but the directing saves it. The villain is much better than recent villains in comic book films. Dakota Johnson's acting was pitiful though. Overall, not as bad as everyone makes it seem."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Yikes. What a horrible movie. I don't know how this has a 68% on the audience score, because this is among the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm not even gonna waste my time talking about why this is bad, so I'll just tell you now: Don't watch it."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,this movie was so good and dakota johnson looked and acted FABULOUS!
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie rules. I hope they make 6 more of these
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The movie was okay up until the end, but the ending was corny"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not even motivated to watch the commercials for this movie, and why was this an idea to make I have no idea. Definitely one you'd want to save the price of admission for something else like a great dinner with a date.."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I just... this is not only not really a ""super hero"" movie, it's hard to say just WHAT I watched. It's a mess and wastes some interesting actresses in a script that HAD to be partially created by AI."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"We had the honor of attending the premiere last night in LA and this movie is full of action, mystery, suspense, sisterhood, and girl power. It is perfect for date night or a family movie night. Everyone will love it. The best part is that if you are a fan of Marvel movies, you don't have to see any previous movies to understand Madame Web. This movie stands alone with a phenomenal cast and great story line. It is rated PG-13 and it is 1 hour and 54 minutes.  There are also no mid or end credit scenes."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I liked it, it was different & funny! Dakota and Sydney were great in it. I like seeing majority female cast. Editing was off in a few areas, but I've seen much worse."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"horrid, awful story, awful plot, awful characters"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Contrived, poor acting and misleading. Sony please try hard"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Trashy hilarious fun. If you've seen Venom you know exactly what to expect. Buy extra popcorn to throw at the screen
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I actually liked it, idk"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Poor acting, crying scenes with no tears, deadpan performance by the lead actress, weird backstory, seemed rushed, and just boring all the way around for a marvel movie. Another dud!"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it alote but the beginning was kinda bland but then it got better. I liked how they put spider man as a baby witch we never scean Peter as a baby before. But like the FNAF movie the critics tackled it too much. so for this one I would say don't trust the critics. I would probably buy this movie no doubt.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I honestly was baffled, and delighted by this movie. They did a nice job of revealing motivations for why characters behaved the way they did. I thought the acting was superb. I felt I was learning the main characters powers at the same time they were figuring it out. Really fun watch!"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,There are not enough words to express how absolutely lame this movie is.  A complete waste of space. Marvel is dead.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Honestly that was the worst movie I've watched in 12mths.
Disjointed and action scenes(not many for the length) were just a lot of flashes of single scenes.
Marvel should be ashamed and Pepsi Cola invested in the wrong movie.
Made Aquaman look like an Oscar winner!"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie was fantastic! It presented a compelling plot and storyline, something lacking in many recent superhero franchise films. Definitely a must-see!"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Good lord this was a mess.  Terrible editing, disaster of a plot, completely diverged from its source material, and a cast that seemed to know it was going to be hot garbage even during filming.  I really miss the days of good comic movies.  I really want to start looking forward to them again but stuff like this ruins that."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"We went to see this movie for Valentines Day, and we enjoyed it.  The special effects were great!  I hope that they come out with a second movie!"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Dull, overly complicated in its plotting, and riddled with sloppy editing, stilted performances, and poor character development, Madame Web is a Spider-Man spin-off that's so bad I had to resort to quoting Jay Sherman from The Critic ""Hotchie Motchie, It Stinks""!"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"It's fresh, makes you feel suspense, amazing story, I like it"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This movie is not near as bad as the current reviews for it. I found it to be engaging and interesting. Sometimes the dialogue was a little awkward and the action sequences were a little jumbled and hard to follow, but overall it was an enjoyable movie to add to the ""super hero"" genre. There are only so many comic book characters that can get a movie can be made about so at this point I almost do not fault them when some do not land as well."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was very good, it was worth seeing, it really surprised me a lot."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Starts out ok, but then the dialogue gets worse, the story gets more muddled and all the performances take a dive. This was a huge whiff and one of the most poorly directed and shot films in recent memory."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"whomever wrote this should be banned from mcu. this more like a DC movie, some of the dialog is worst than dune. the writer has no clue about the madam web character at all."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Story was solid and linear the acting wasn't the best but the characters were enjoyable.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,The believability of the plot and everything and anything that happens is zero.  The character development is zero.  I had zero care in the world about any one of the characters.  I didn't thing marvel could get worse.....they did.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"was waiting for nothing, still disappointed 
probably the worst marvel movie ever made with Morbius and Quantumania"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great origin story for looks like it'll be a spectacular trilogy. So much fun and smartly put together.

Perfectly wove the ""Spiderverse"" into it. Can't wait to see the sequel(s)!!!"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Simply Ass movie by Sony
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"If you can't enjoy a movie when it's poorly made, don't see this. If you don't care how poorly made a movie is, you just like costumes and action, go see it. The best part of this movie was the soundtrack consisting of 2000's divas. The script is bad, the editing is awful, and most of the dialogue feels like a mad lib."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Terrible dialouge and editing. Just awkward, amateur, and basic."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This is worse than The Marvels garbage. If anyone in gunpoint told me to either rewatch Madame Web or The Marvels, I'd ask them to shoot me dead."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"this was a fun watch , really hope to see them again honestly :) ."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I thought it was quite refreshing, honestly. Didn't need many action scenes to tell a nice story. Acting wasn't the greatest but seemed to get better as the movie went on. Also Sydney Sweeney is my new crush lol."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,The WORST MARVEL. IVE EVER SEEN. Like literally DO NOT make a sequel 🥴🥴🥴🙄🙄🙄🙏🏾🤮🤮
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,One of the worst superhero films in the past 20 years.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Dakota and the kids are great! There's a weird dub for the villain with horrible on-the-nose dialogue in his scenes. But he's not the true focus of the film, is he?"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"What ever you do don't pay to watch this, it was bambling incoherent mess."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's a good movie, not perfect, but a good and funny one.
I don't know why people are complaining about the lack of action, the powers of her are not physical, I think it's a good balance of action.
If you don't go to the theater expecting something bad you will enjoying the movie

My rate is a solid 7.9/10"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Pains me to say that this is one of the worst comic book movies I've ever seen (and one of my worst of this year). The cast was wasted, the editing in this is atrocious, but none of it matches how horrendous the writing in this is. The story was a great concept, but it was executed in every wrong way possible. The villain was LAUGHABLY bad, and for a superhero movie, there was almost nothing superhero, and there was no fun whatsoever to have with this besides the diner scene, maybe. This makes Morbius look like Grand Budapest Hotel."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Great background story telling of Madame Web for those that don’t know about the character. It had it’s comedic scenes and a great build up overall. Highly recommend to watch.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I don't know what Sony is trying to do, but damn it was so boring and cringe seeing that movie, I recommend to watch Morbius better"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I don't know where to start.


I like bad movies sometimes, I can see the value of a good laugh. This wasn't a film I wanted to end up like that. Yet, that's what this ended up being. Not even a good-bad film, just a really tough watch. I feel for Dakota Johnson and Sidney Sweeney though; they actually had some of the better acting moments in the film. Also shout out to Isabel Merced, she was good too. The film felt like the editing team didn't know what to do and just left B-roll in. Scenes hung too long and others telegraphed their relation to the end of the film way too hard. The villain was also just….bad. It was a bad experience overall."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The movie is so terribly flawed that it’s just not worth seeing. Starting with Dakota Johnson who is possibly the worst choice for a marvel movie, tbh she was hard to watch in this movie. The story line and the nearly all female cast leaves much to be desired. Special effects too were lacking."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Madam Web is clearly meant to set up a new Marvel universe. Weather this happens or not is yet to be seen. But the film itself was inoffensive; it had some interesting ideas, ok action, so-so characters, & a story that piques my curiosity for the future. Let's see where this thread takes us, hopefully without any tangling."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Terrible movie like morbius
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,It was not what I expected but worth checking out.  The story was interesting and even had me laughing at times
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie concept was way better than expectations. This is the best movie that could be possibly made based on source material.  Left me on the edge of my seat. Unique way to showing clairvoyance
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"A very good story which starts off a little slow and maybe could need some more work but holds well true out, is it one of the all top marvel movies no, but it's definitely a very good and sometimes suspenseful & fun ride. All actors are very good, just wish we got to see the spider costumes a little more but that's fine. The visuals are what I liked the most especially whit cassandras visions plus the action was good wish we got even more of it tough. Over all very happy whit this movie! I hope somehow we see these characters again."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Awesome cast, movie and ending!"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I heard a lot of bad things about this movie but went to see it on opening night anyway. The movie is much better than critics make it out to be. No, it's not the usual Spider-Man movie and it has no extra scene (you have to have an extra scene) but the story is quite interesting. It is the typical kids in a superhero movie but it focuses on outwitting the bad guy, not overpowering them. Casting was good except the villain. Overall, pretty good!"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,The villains acting was horrible. Not only that I literally fell asleep during the movie twice. I'm a huge Marvel fan and this is for sure the worst marvel Film.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"É menos pior do que eu esperava. O roteiro é um show de conveniência e facilidades, o que fica um pouco mais ameno com uma personagem que vê o futuro. Os personagens não tem desenvolvimento, apenas umas 3 frases sobre suas vidas e passado. Me deu a impressão de ser um filme sem propósito, só existe pq sim."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Good to see Marvel trying something new and exploring new characters. It's exciting to see more world building beginning to cement new characters into the MCU. 
The story was thrilling and kept me on edge, as well as amusing to see familiar faces and names from a different perspective."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Definitely go see this movie Madame Web!  I loved it.  I was mesmerized throughout the entire two hours of the movie as were all other members of my group.  I don't understand these critics.  Were they watching the same movie?  The girls were great and their onscreen chemistry was high!  The only fault I found was that we didn't see Dakota and the girls in their suits more often.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Way too much and yet not enough. Fun, but only after half of the movie is over."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Me pareció entretenida, ya quiero ver la siguiente película"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I went to see this movie in Wednesday night Valentine's Day This movie was so great. I think this is a good movie, Madame Web better than all the movies that have come out years ago if you trying to see this movie, I'm going to let you know if you are waiting for Post-Credit Scenes you are wasting your time. for this movie"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I don’t know if I’d say the dialogue is cringy but it definitely isn’t good. The choices made, with dialogue as well as imagery, to connect this film to a character who hasn’t been born in this universe yet were definitely cringy to me. Overall the story wasn’t great. I would love to see the 3 up and coming heroines/actresses in future stories but this film most likely put an end to that."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,One of the worst I have ever seen
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,A única coisa que impede do filme ser ruim é a maravilhosa Dakota Johnson
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,I really enjoyed this film! A basic Marvel movie that reminds me of a 2000's comic book film and I love that about it! Dakota Johnson gives a great performance!
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,was the movie the best quality in the world? absolutely not. do i need three more movies? absolutely i do because oh my god. was there an issue for most of the movie with the syncing of the audio? yea. did i care more about what happened to the characters more than i have for most of the movies i've seen in recent time? 10000%
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Just when I thought a Marvel movie could not get any worse than the recent flops, I see they have hit a new low with this mess."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Bad doesn't begin to describe this movie. The acting , the dialogue, the plot full of holes, maybe it was made for kids? Even then most kids movies aren't this bad. I tried to give it a shot and I was horribly disappointed. Save your money."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Very different interesting twist
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,Not as bad as people are saying. Critics are sad people.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Dallas Johnson not good in this movie, it was silly but entertaining!

Madame Web"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was a great movie, that stayed relatively comic accurate. I would recommend the movie."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was bad I went to the premiere for the hell of it and I have to say the select actors were a solid choice but the direction of the movie was over all mid and the villain was mediocre
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Intense, emotional and nostalgic!"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Loved it the cast was awesome too
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"It's a very good movie! It respects the character very well and does not get bored.... The work done is appreciated, since he is a very difficult character to bring to the big screen! I hope to see one more together with the 3 spider-womens."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,A waste of time. Nothing more to say
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,I literally fell asleep from how boring the movie was
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,I rate this movie a 7 out of 10
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"AMAZING!! the scenes were intense and suspenseful in all the right places, perfect comedic timing! Acting was astounding felt it was a real homage to the comics! Only downside was the villain I felt he maybe wasn't best suited to role, his physical capabilities were insane but his acting I felt fell flat. Other than an a defo must see! Planning on seeing it again in a weeks time!"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Horrible movie, I want to die please"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web, like Morbius, doesn't justify its existence. The film is a cringe fest. I don't recommend it!"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,honestly pretty good story! i adored the characters and the pacing of it. my only complaint was the quality of the movie and filming. you could tell when someone was being voiced over by their lips not matching the sound and there was a lot of frame drops. other than the lacking quality i loved the movie.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"not as enterainring as other Marvel movies, seems like they just spent the whole movie budget on the cast and not on the actual movie"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Why does this film exist? And why are we going to watch it?
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,its amazing. i love it.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"you so called critics who hated this movie need to get the stick out of your***
will it win a oscar? no. But it was sooooo much better than marvels or aquaman. dont let those stinkers stop you from going. its a really fun wild ride and dakota johnson is really wonderful."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Hot garbage, anyone that tells you otherwise is lying. Doesn't even count as a superhero movie in my book cuz the characters never get their powers or suits (any image you've seen of them in costume was a vision). The finale consists of Dakota Johnson basically using her ability to see the future to tell them ""duck! Now jump!"" At this point, Sony making Spiderman movies without Spiderman feels like some kind of money laundering scheme."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Bad pacing, bad writing, bad acting, just everything about this movie was bad in some way. I honestly can't express how boring the first 3/4 of the film are, meanwhile the last quarter is a jumbled mess that's rushing to get everything done before the 2 hour mark ending quite abruptly, with one of the worst endings I've ever seen. Just save your money and save your time."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Como para irte a dormir 🥱
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,it's funny to watch how bad it is
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"La película esta muy enredada, no tiene sentido"
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I understand that it was an ""origin"" movie now! I was expecting a lot more costumes and action. But, I'm looking forward to seeing the next installment."
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,I loved all the characters they did an Awsome job !
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Um dos piores filmes que a Sony já fez.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,It was a good entry that might have used some brushing up with respect to the dialogue; the final destination like ability was pretty cool and seeing the origin story of the character was enjoyable; Hopefully Sony sticks to tying the live action entries together.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Oof. A lot of nothing. Cast did very well
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"For the love of God, STOP LETTING PEOPLE WITH NO TALENT MAKE MOVIES!"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Honestly it was very good, yes some parts were a bit awkward and cheesy but it's a marvel movie it's meant to be for kids and teens, I'm definitely buying it when it comes out!!!"
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,i think it’s definitely worth a watch
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie was slow but enjoyable because not every movie needs to be packed with action. For future generations this is going to be good for the kids especially young girls.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Barley any action and the girls were only in suit for barley 2 minutes. You can tell Sony  has no idea what they are doing with this Spider-Man spin off universe. Bad acting and lacked action. Don't waste your time watching this.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Unbelievably boring and tired in its plot and script. I don't understand how you make a Spiderman film without Spiderman. The whole girl empowerment theme is so incredibly boring. Watching the movie was a form of torture that is not for the faint of heart. Don't waste your time or money.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"• This movie, plagued with illogical plot holes, features three spiderwomen reduced to mere extras, engaging in sarcastic banter, while the best scenes seemingly fell victim to excessive editing.


• This movie, plagued with illogical plot holes, features three spiderwomen reduced to mere extras, engaging in sarcastic banter, while the best scenes seemingly fell victim to excessive editing."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,It's a good film if you grew up watching or reading Spider-Man you will probably enjoy this movie the camera work is amazing and they do a great job showing the difference between madame web powers and ezekiel sims powers the characters are pretty cool and overall it's a good film not the best but not the worst
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie just flat out sucks.
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,That was the worst Spider-Man movie I have ever watched the worst one ever created
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,I thought this movie was amazing especially for an origin story I was very excited about it and I hope everyone else ignores all the negative reviews and goes to watch it for themselves. I can't wait for the story to be continued I'll be at the movie theater every time to be eating my popcorn and watching.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Overall a good movie, gets corny the last 10 minutes so just be ready for that."
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Enthralling to watch! The action scenes were thrilling and well balanced with the story. absolutely loved how they showed her powers. Excited to see where this goes and always a joy to see more things from the spiderverse
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Please don't waste your money and time
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not even kidding when i say I feel dumber after watching this. Not even so bad it's good. I was going into this HOPING for another ""so bad it's good"" movie like Morbius, and somehow was still disappointed."
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Entretenida, amena, divertida. Diferente del resto de películas de Marvel. Nos encantó."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"""Madam Web"" disappoints with a weak plot, shallow characters, and uninspired direction. It lacks substance and coherence, failing to justify its existence in the crowded superhero genre."
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Very good movie, i dont know why people are hating it so much, its fun, i didnt see bad acting or bad script, okay fx are not excellent but still very good movie, im hoping to see second movie or something with girls"
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,It was an amazing movie she doesn't have super powers so if you want to see a movie with super hero this is not the movie the actors are amazing it was well-written so stop expecting so much and stop being a hater please
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Easily my favourite SPUMC movie (I know it's a low bar).

Some clunky writing, set up for a sequel that won't happen, a waste of some talented actors and eye rolling Parker tie-ins aside, I had a pretty fun time.

None of the problems were Dakota Johnson's fault (she was pretty good), I enjoyed the future visions and there was some fun action.

I also really enjoyed that it didn't look like it was filmed in a green screen cupboard like recent MCU stuff."
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,It’s not that bad .. not sure why the critics are marking it so low.. not perfect but enjoyable for these types of movies. 
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,After the marvels I thought I'm not gonna see something worst. I was wrong..
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's very mid. Kinda boring actually, but Dakota Johnson is great."
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"I personally really liked it. There's a ton of fun references to spider-man media, and it's a really good setup for these characters. A couple of the vfx shots were a little bit spotty, but overall it was a fun movie."
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"I honestly don't think it's that bad like most critics say. It's true that the story is kind of flat and this movie would have been a better one in early 2000s when super hero movies just came out. BUT, to me at least this movie knows what it's doing and does not attempt to over-achieve. The leading character's ability is also more on the strategic side so it's not like she would be shooting webs and crawl all over the walls like Spider-Man does. It's also much better than most superhero movies came out last year: it knows what it's doing and it does a decent job."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The worst super hero film, or just film I've ever seen.  Worth seeing just because of how hilariously bad it is.  Drink before watching"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"No action, no suits, no nothing. There’s like 2 min max of action with suits which is in his dream"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,More or less the movie but I love it because my favorite spider female is Anya corazon and I hope In the future isabela Merced coming back as Anya corazon Solo movie ❤️🕷️🕸️
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,I'm sorry but this was completely unwatchable.
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,liked this way better than the other reviewers did. it wasn't perfect but it certainly was fun
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I understand where the frustration is coming from. These days we have something called 'social media' that highers the expectations of people. Everyone thought there will be at least one of our spidermen (Tobey, Andrew, Tom) showing up and when they actually saw the movie, no, it didn't happen. They also wanted to see some action from the female spideys, no, that didn't happen. 

I mean the movie is literally called ""Madame Web,"" so shouldn't it be more logical to show her origins and make the movie more about her? That's what they did. Also, it's just the first movie where they are introducing four new characters on the silverscreens, so whatever they showed, I think it's enough. There's no post-credit scene, is that bothering people so much? Oh, come on, it's Sony, they don't like to play with post-credits. It was decent to me. 

Funny how 'social media' always works, one person bashes a content and then we've got another army of peeps coming up right then to bash the same content. It seems as if everyone has lost their individual opinions these days and choose to go with what the mass audience says."
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie! I hope they make a sequel!
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Critics are being mean for no reason. Great movie !
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"genuinely do not understand all the overly harsh reviews. this is a fun movie with a great cast, and not nearly as bad as everyone is making it out to be."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Rolling Stones put it perfectly! Madame Web isn't as bad a you've heard. It's so much worse! Sony please stop l!
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,script was horrible and plot was dumb
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie was excellent.  great story from start to finish.
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Honestly, I had a great time watching Madame Web. It isn't Citizen Kane, but it's fine for a superhero movie. It feels very early aughts. Which might have been an issue to some but I loved it. It felt nostalgic. Dakota did a good job with what she had to work it. The rest of the cast was fine too."
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,the most movie to movie ever. it had actors. a director. it had a story. it is truly the film of all time.
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Comparing it to the SSU films, Madame Web is the best!"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,It was good but couldve been better
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Generico, historia fraca, personagens que ninguem se importar, um humor que não funciona de jeito nenhum e um dos piores vilões de todos os tempos. Isso resumir madame teia"
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Very slow start but excelled at the end making it a good film
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,It was a pretty good movie kept me entertained the whole time.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,best part is the pepsi product placement ..............
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Well, I went to see it on IMAX, and it did not disappointed, too much.
Yes, it might be a bit slow and difficult to track, but overall it is a good movie. I would watch it again."
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie can’t wait to see part 2
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,The story jumped around too much. Maybe later we will learn more about the 3 girls...
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,Intriguing movie with a good start but fails to make use of the spidermen like characters action wise.
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"the film is ok, fun, you can watch and relax, but it would be better if it were straight to streaming"
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Peak Fiction!!!!!!!!
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,It's a pleasant movie. Much better than I expected considering all the bad reviews I could read. I enjoyed it.
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"I can honestly say, I think that this movie was a perfect beginning to something greater.

Also, I got to meet one of the writers parents. Talk about one in infinite."
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"The film is incredible, the chemistry between the characters is incredible, it seems like they are sisters in real life and were born to be together"
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"So first off this movie was not in promotion mode at all let me just say that. Secondly, this movie was set  in 2003 and that’s exactly what the movie looked like and felt like as well it was kind of Ben Afflecks Daredevil feel to it but the movie was good, it was watchable. I gave it 4 stars because the acting was phenomenal and the story line was great, now this movie is a origin/intro to the marvel cinematic also there is no post credit scene I repeat no post credit scene but go watch the movie it is enjoyable"
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,A novel approach to the Spiderman legend not too long and very enjoyable. I liked the actors appearing in this story. I hope Marvel continue this storyline.
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"the movie is really good, cast did the really good job and the story is different, yeah it is unlike other marvel movies but not everything need to be going in the same direction always, great movie to watch, Dakota did SO GOOD. recommend ❤️ 
P.S whole theater laughed at funny moments, Cassies humor etc. So everyone that is writing the movie is really bad or bad acting apparently can`t enjoy movies and is too critical.... have life guys comparing to other movies on the market this is like Oscars"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web, a ridiculous title for a film without merit, hollow, empty without direction and extremely boring. Dakota shows a poor and weak performance if you can call her presence acting, since she seems more like an acting student in her first performance which makes her look like deleted scenes from 50 Shades of Grey. A mockery of the Spiderman saga. The worst thing SONY has created. Even the villain is a mediocre parody of what a villain should be. There is no way to argue anything positive about this movie, it's just a waste of time."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Another movie for a modern audience failed again. The film editing was terrible and the movie was very difficult to watch.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Only because I can’t give it nothing 🤦🏻‍♂️ Dear god.. if you want to experience the first train wreck of 2024 then have fun for TWO MF HOURS… baffled.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I wasted my money on this shitty movie. Not worth watching! It's awful in everything!!! Cinemas must add a refund option for this kind of situations, I'm so pissed i lost my money on something so gross and unwatchable."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Two questions: first, Can we get rid of Zasama and Sharpless? And second, can we sue sony´s marketing team? This movie is not what the trailers told us it was."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I don't know the comic bok version but as a single Marvel story I really liked the story, acting and the action was surprising.  There is some humor in the beginning that I enjoy as well. Not amazing but not bad as well. I don't regret ignoring the bad review online and going to see it."
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Do not understand the hate. People hate just to hate nowadays.
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed the movie to be honest. Great characters and acting!
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Harmless, expectations low"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"i LOVED this movie. the soundtrack was great the acting was amazing and the action and comedy is definitely 5 stars. BUT the camera work is a little bit strange because it randomly zooms in, the writing could be dumb at times and the ending wasn't necessarily terrible but it's DEFINITELY not good"
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Perfect, i love this move"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,This is not a good movie they just ruined Spider-man it is sad that Marvel will go down this route of horrible movie
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Madame web was a treat to watch. Dakota as casey web was exceptional. The movie, the story line, every character will leave a mark. It's a must watch!!"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst films I've ever seen. Horrendous writing, directing, audio, CGI, acting - you name it, it's awful. Nothing about this film is redeeming. Avoid it."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The acting is horrible, all Spider-Man movies before this one were great but absolutely not this. Venom and Morbius blow this movie out the water"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Wish I had kept my money instead, really don't waste your time the story is all over and makes no sense at all"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The movie was not well paced, often random things happend just to explain why the next thing is about to happen. Acting was alright but was also sometimes cringe. Through out the film there where countless cheap jumpscares which became annoying after the first 10. Overall pretty mid film would suggest watching somthing with creativity."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"OMG who gave this movie a green light?
What a WASTE of money and actors this is going to be yet another MEGAFLOP!!!"
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it. Not an overly exaggerated girl power action movie.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The movie was awful. It was some how worse than The Marvels, story was awful, dialog horrible, and zero chemistry between any of the characters. Wish I could have watched a Morbius 2, at least that some what resembled the comics more than this trash"
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Good movie wish it was more action....
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"If I could give this movie zero stars I would, and if anyone is giving it more than 2 they were paid to do it. I have seen every marvel movie on opening day since iron man 3 and never have I been more disappointed. Not only was the script unrealisticly bad but there were so many moment of completely illegible ADR that I completely missed plot points because I was so distracted by the mouths moving at completely different times and rhythms than the words being produced by the speakers. I'm not a movie critic, I'll never claim to be one, but the fact that Sony released this movie is insulting to the people whose jobs it is to rate movie. I paid 11$ to watch that movie and spent 1hr and 54mins watching it and I've never wanted to or felt the need to ask for a refund before but today was almost that day. To anyone reading these to reactions and reviews to decide whether or not to see the movie. STOP. RUN. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.
Thank you for coming to my ted talk on my account that I literally created today to make this review to help other people from seeing this movie."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The movie itself felt very slow. The end I enjoyed very much. Overall not a bad movie, I don’t think it needed to be 2 hours long"
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,I absolutely loved Dakota! She was so so good in Madame Web.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Decent movie, not as bad as they say it is. If you're looking for a true marvel type of movie that's going to rock you, this isn't it, but it will satisfy you for a bit for a couple of hours. This is probably one for streaming or video."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Great effects and somewhat interesting characters. One-dimensional and predictable story doe.  Wouldn't recommend.
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining movie from beginning to end, liked Dakota with Adam Scott, all the three girls were cute too."
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Love it love it so worth watching again 🥰
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"SO good! Critics, per usual are WAY too brutal with movies. If we depended on the critics' reviews for a good movie, we'd be searching countlessly. 
This was a dang good movie. Extremely underrated, wildly entertaining, and great plot. Considering most of the recent Marvel movies have been sub-par, this was a refreshing one to give us in the midst of the marvel cinema drought. 
We need to stop comparing everything to early Marvel. No, its not Endgame. Yes, its a dang good movie. Enjoy!"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I really wanted to like this movie that absolutely zero people were begging for,  I thought the trailer looked better than I was expecting.  But I was quickly beaten into submission with one exposition dump after exposition dump for both the titular character and the larger Spiderverse at large.  The story is needlessly laughable at times. Spider lore crammed in every nook and cranny.  I'm not sure who this movie is for, given that no one was asking for it."
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,A film that if there was no connection with the Sonyverse would have done very well
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"El guión tiene sus fallos mejorables pero me ha encantado. La fotografía está muy bien tiene un buen ritmo de montaje, los personajes están muy bien construidos. Por fin una peli de superheroínas que nos representa a las mujeres sin sexualizar nos. Mis dieses."
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Must see for Spider-Man fans. It's an entertaining movie.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,How do you make a spider-man spin-off movie with any mention of Spider-man? Worst of all the pacing is rushed and story was very mid.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Seriously, were there people out there who thought this was actually gonna be any good!? Two of the worst writers currently working in Hollywood, a director at the helm of her first feature film, and the movie's lead firing her agent after the first (and only) trailer dropped and then going on an apology tour up until the movie's release were all the tell tale signs of an absolute mess hitting the theatres. An unmitigated disaster in every department, especially in it's editing (my word, how many cuts do really need in a single scene!?). I did get a chuckle when they set-up the potential for future sequels at the end... you don't need to be clairvoyant to know that that ain't happening."
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was a pleasant surprise, I was expecting something really bad but this movie was decent and at worst at the level of recent Marvel productions"
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Tbh this movie wasn't so bad sure it wasn't the best but I actually enjoyed dakota Johnson Sydney Sweeney celestie and isabela performances it's a 9.5/10 for me
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Brilliant movie.  For the first time in a while I actually cared about the characters on screen and felt the desire to route for them.
They were all developed very well, especially the lead Cassie who went through very strong character development.

Madams Webs ability was handled very very well and I actually felt dread and fear when I thought the characters lives were in danger.

The villain was probably the weakest in terms of character development however a semi 2d villain still worked with all the other characters development as it felt like a recurring foe they had to overcome.

Music was also strong thought I wish the spider man theme might have been used more (though that's just personal preference)

No post credit scene unfortunately but the movie still manages to hint at more to come which I absolutely love and allows us the viewer to come up with what happens next"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,I enjoyed the movie. I know a lot of people are hating on it but I think it's a good easy watch. The actresses did a great job and would love to see more of their characters.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Horrid waste of time and painful to watch. Wouldn't even want it on in the background on a phone to fill the never ending void
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The only good thing was how it was leading into the Amazing Spiderman's story they started but never finished. Other than that, I struggled to stay awake."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I've seen every marvel movie in the last two decades in theaters on opening night, and i've stood up for everything up to morbius.  I was hoping after discussion of the reshoot that this was going to be at least 'decent'.  I went in with low expectations, but .... well, this movie just fails to even try to rise to any occasion.  the actors mostly did a good job with what they had, but the dialog and script were just atrocious.   I'd be hard pressed to find anything comparable.  If this is a sign of what Sony considers a good production, then I'm scared of what will happen to the spider man franchise without marvel holding their hand."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,The movie is just a jumbled mess and has little to no connection to the Marvel Universe.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Wasn’t disappointed but not thrilled either , it was like a 2 hour origins movie with the actual movie to come next. "
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Pure cancer. Nothing more. Nothing less.
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Practicamwnte es lo que rsoeraba ver  , y pasar un buen rato"
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Achei um filme bem independente. Em vínculos com outros filme, pode ser que venham gerar vínculos no futuro. Poderiam ter explorado mais o poder dela. apesar do CGI não ser bom no início, no fim ele melhora. Gostei do crescimento da personagem. Espero ver a parte 2 desse filme"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I don't believe I've ever truly, genuinely felt bad for everyone associated with a film."
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Madame Web is an impeccable film, with few flaws, which are only due to the camera play in the final act of the film, it brings the culture of the 2000s very well, all the audiovisual texture is perfect and very well chosen, the cast is a 10 , Dakota and her girls carry the film with professionalism and passion, humor, drama and action is very present, really a very good film that should be watched by all fans, especially as it diverts the repetitive look of the Spider-Man saga and brings a feminine tone (which is not harmful) to the universe, it only adds."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Did AI write this movie?!? Its atrociously bad
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Me encanto la película, tenía expectativas bajas por las críticas pero me sorprendió la calidad en todos los sentidos,Principalmente me pareció buena ya que no sentí la necesidad de que apareciera spiderman, con un excelente desarrollo de todos los personajes y referencias al universo de spiderman. la peor película que he visto en mis 23 años en the Batman 2022 y esa película dicen que es una carta de amor al cine."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,For me that movie was not good
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,I was waiting for something that just was never gonna come. I feel like Ezekiel Sims from the comic book was a little bit different than portrayed on the movie. The movie just dragged on with nothing happening. Leave marvel to disney i guess
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,It was an interesting movie with a good and promising cast. Loved how they tried to stick close to the comic books and also built in some great Easter eggs. I as a Spider-Man Fan was very entertained. Do not listen to the bad reviews please and give this movie a fair chance.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Did nothing for me, far from entertainment. Time I can't get back! Don't waste your money."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,The origin of how Madam Web became an icon as well as what Peter Parker uncle Benjamin was like before he was born.
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,It started off very dramatic and with a touch of comedy! Then it really transformed into an action packed movie with a great cast I personally really enjoyed the movie.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,terrible movie! waste of time for me
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Madame Web sweeppppppppppppppppp
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I am surprised it got such dreadful reviews from the critics, but they appear to be panning everything at the moment. I actually enjoyed the film. I've definitely seen a lot worse, and a lot better, but it's entertaining, and that's what I expect when I go to see a marvel/superhero movie."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Sony nos da los que todos a esta altura estamos esperando. Absolutamente nada. Al parecer quieren enterrar el género o la empresa, no lo sé aun."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,I’ve seen better acting in porn :|
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Sony siendo Sony , con el universo de Spiderman"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,It's not that bad. 6/10
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Worst superhero movie in a long time… maybe Sony should just not unless it animated?
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"de lo peor, ni la sydney con sus ""detalles"" lo salva , sony ya regresa los derechos a mrvel studios disney , no gasten su dinero en eso"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Una tortura de inicio a fin.
No pude desperdiciar más San Valentín con mi pareja. Un inicio que dura el 90% de la película para dejarte un final inconcluso y lleno de sinsentidos.
A la protagonista parece que no le afecta en absoluto el ser buscada por secuestrar a 3 niñas, robar 2 vehículos y destrozar 3 locales (y asumo que matar a varios inocentes), entre otras cosas.
Totalmente predecible y con frases y escenas cliché.
Tan mala que me he tenido que crear una cuenta aquí para comentar el trauma que me ha dejado."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Ok wow, WOW did this movie suck, Madame Web is a Boring, Generic piece of slop that is somehow worse than the so called ""famous"" Morbius."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"one of the worst things i've seen in such a long time, i actually started to have such a great time"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I think the movie definitely had potential it just lacked a better script and a better villain. Everything was good other than those two points as the casting, cgi and overall plot was good but these two key parts dragged it down."
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Marvel have done a great job here expanding the spiderverse. Nobody will remember this as a classic but one that built the story. 4/5
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,I know loads of people hate on this movie but I don't see why. I really enjoyed this film. Yes there's a couple or corny lines but doesn't every film have that. I love the villain based on his story even tho it is petty killing teenagers I think his motives is fair as he is a bad guy so obviously he is going to do what he must to stay alive. Maybe the advertising could've been better cuz they advertised as if we were going to see the girls in their suits which we sort of did but it wasn't a big part of the film therefore lacking things some people may have wanted. Overall I don't see the hate it's a fun enjoyable film with some callbacks to Spider-Man which people say was forced but it really wasn't.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Trash movie. Plot sucks. Acting is poor and villain is weak.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Seemed like a fan film. Recorded on a potato
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Muchos pero mucho huecos en el guión, inconsistencias, el villano es malo que le da la gana y sus diálogo ni se diga nada, mejor que lo hicieran que no hablara, parece una peli de destino final mal echa."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Another girl boss movie… at this point you think they would get it but in a stupid society where they push anything but skills and talents you can't expect more.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Bad acting, bad special effects and boring plot line. Felt more like a comedy-drama than a superhero movie. Watch Grey’s Anatomy instead."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,What in the world is this movie. 2024 is off to a bad start
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie. I have now learned that reviews are not reliable when there are Sony comics. Absolutely recommended.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Hot mess with a weak script, bad editing, couple of laughs, not alot of action felt like a 2000's comic book film but not in the good way."
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Good movie good to see new actress's on screen kept me on edge throughout would recommend seeing it. Good action scenes and effects would watch again. Hope they make a second movie.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web is not a good or bad movie but as a whole for me it was decent. Everything was boring up until the diner sequence, that's when I started to like this movie and surprisingly it kept being decent even till the end. So to conclude I belive the movie isn't as bad as the critics were saying."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,cant believe marvel are making movies about people without powers. TV MOVIE at best
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Every time, I wonder how Marvel manages to make more worse. Here, unsurprisingly, it's extremely bad."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Morbius, perhaps I treated you too harshly... and here, have a Pepsi on me."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This Movie is Horrible, Weird and Boring"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This is the best non-Avengers movie I've seen from Marvel. It had some cheesy parts, but overall it was enjoyable and I'd see it again!"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Not worth the time to watch
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"I loved it , the whole web thing is kind of great 👍"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,THIS is what happens when Hollywood accountants are making the decision about which films get produced and which ones dont.. Basically? If you're a struggling screenwriter looking to break into the business? Put the name SPIDERMAN somewhere in the title and some 22 year old Hollywood Exec will green light it....
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Best movie ever, the movie has such good writing"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie brought be 2 hours closer to death.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web is astoundingly awful. The acting is all around questionable, the dialogue is painful to listen to,  and it feels as if it was edited with IMovie on a 7 year olds IPad. I can't for the life of me figure out how this movie was approved for theaters."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Not Good , Not bad .
Road to Spiderwoman"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Honestly I don't know who approves this movies this is the worst comic book movie I have ever seen everything in it was executed poorly right now I hope this will finally show Sony that this universe will never work without a spider man in it and that they have to give the spider man right back to marvel the mcu tom Holland and Andrew Garfield and just admit defeat with the SSU.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"was kind of disappointed with this as the suits were wasted, Plot felt rushed and NO END CREDITS! Dakota Johnson & Sydney Sweeney Do their best but overall It was a giant let down"
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"It has gotten a bad rap.  I enjoyed it.  The portrayal of Madame Web’s powers was incredible.  The acting in general was meh.  I actually did like Dakota’s performance.  Like Captain Marvel, the character is very mellow/matter of fact.  Overall 6/10.  The possibilities for the future were left ambiguously open.  Fits perfectly in the Marvel Multiverse!"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"To be honest, is a bad movie.
Is a nul film. Do not watch this mauvais movie."
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,In spite of the critics who destroyed the film before they saw it. A nice movie that I had a lot of fun with. Dakota and everyone were great.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Madame Web had the potential to surpass Marvel Studios' The Marvels and Sony's Mobius, but the film ended up leaving a bitter taste for Spider-Man universe fans. The movie is very disconnected from the world of Spider-Man."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"If you liked The Marvels, you will likely think this is meh. If you did not like The Marvels, you will think this is a hotter pile of garbage.
If you hated Morbius... know there's worse movies out there, and this may be one of them."
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"THIS MOVIE IS PEAK CINEMA! PEAK, PEAK, PEAK! MASTERPIECE FORM BEGINNING TO END! THE NEXT MORBIUS! #MAMAMEWEBSWEEP"
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"In the end, the movie is pretty decent. Sure, there are some issues with the acting, and some awkward scenes, but that's okay, I've seen much worse, and the main characters were very nice to follow."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"In Sony's continued quest to expand the Spider-Man universe without the titular hero, they've stumbled upon Madame Web, a character beloved by many but perhaps not ready for her cinematic close-up. Despite the intriguing premise and the allure of multiple ‘webheads' promised in the trailers, the film falls short of expectations, leaving both Spider-Man fans and general moviegoers feeling a bit underwhelmed.

Dakota Johnson leads the cast as Cassandra Webb, a paramedic in Manhattan who discovers she has the power to see the future. Johnson delivers a decent performance, but unfortunately, she's let down by a disjointed storyline that struggles to find its footing. While the supporting cast, including Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, and Celeste O'Connor, do their best with what they're given, the lack of depth in some characters and the off-kilter pacing makes it difficult to fully invest in their arcs. One of the film's biggest missteps is the portrayal of the villain, played by Tahar Rahim. Rahim's portrayal of Ezekial feels out of place, with his odd accent and attempt at a Bruce Wayne/Batman-esque persona falling flat. His character lacks the menace and depth needed to truly challenge Madame Web, leaving the climactic showdown feeling somewhat lackluster.

Despite its flaws, it does have its moments, particularly in the final act.
The resolution of the film offers a glimmer of promise, hinting at what could have been if the rest of the movie had lived up to its potential. However, it's hard to shake the feeling that something essential is missing, leaving viewers with a sense of disappointment rather than satisfaction. Directed by SJ Clarkson and featuring a talented ensemble cast including Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, and Isabela Merced, Madame Web had the potential to be a thrilling addition to the Spider-Man universe. Unfortunately, it falls short of expectations, leaving viewers longing for the magic that made the web-slinger's adventures so memorable.

I give Madame Web 3 out of 5 stars. While the film boasts an impressive cast and an intriguing premise, it ultimately fails to deliver a cohesive and engaging story. It's a missed opportunity for Sony to expand their Spider-Verse further in a meaningful way, leaving audiences hoping for better luck with future installments."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Nisiquiera en sus intentos por mantener los derechos del personaje Spiderman pueden hacer algo decente.
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was enjoyable,  had some funny moments,  I could relate to the characters awkwardness. The ending was a bit odd but overall not a bad movie."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,this movie felt like if AI was told to write a script for a superhero movie in 2010. terrible dialogue and villain motivation. false advertising and lackluster 3rd act. YET i still had a perfectly fine time with it. nothing that made me absolutely switch off or hate it
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Worst movie to be released. Sony isn't even trying anymore. Don't recommend it.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The worst thing I've ever seen attached to comic book IP. You know a movie is bad when the only good parts, the ONLY GOOD PARTS, are in flashes during dream sequences. This wasn't a movie it was a con job. They tricked the world into buying tickets to a two hour long trailer. It's bad, like really bad. It makes ""Morbius"" look like ""Winter Soldier."" It's really bad, like it really is really really bad. Horrible. A crime against geekdom. A crime against pop culture. Wow, I really can't get over had horrible it was. Words can't do it justice. It's THAT bad."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Bad character development, cringey acting and terrible storyline with abundance of plot holes and questionable decisions."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Honestly at this point I think many people review films just forgetting that some movies are just a good story with no intentions of being a masterpiece; just a movie to enjoy an alternate world. 
I enjoyed it, it was a litte bit akward at the end but at the end I liked it."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,Too common but enjoyable. Super fan service for spidy fan club. Different way of making superhero movie.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,The worst Marvel movie ever! Sydney Sweeney completely ruined it. Its not even 1 star. its hardly half or it. Thank god i didnt buy a ticket
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Sucks so bad 😔😔😔😔
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's a film that feels familiar but has differences that add a real freshness. It's difficult not to compare it to the spiderman movies and it just does not meet there greatness, but worth a watch."
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"While it's not as good as any MCU title, This movie is at the very least worth watching! The movie is a fun slasher and some of the fight scenes felt really well done!"
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Me encanto. Lo mejor que ha hecho Sony.
Me encanto la trama. La historia muy bien contada. Los personajes muy bien tratados. Me gustaría ver más de esta historia. Ojalá podamos ver la continuación en una madame web 2."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I found that the story and the script were poorly written, I really wanted to love this movie this is coming from a marvel fan boy but I couldn't. I wasn't emotionally connected to any of the characters unfortunately."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's not bad at all. At least I did not go to the rest room for the whole movie, I don't get it why there are some many negative comments, and Johnson's performance is worth praising."
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"#MadameWeb is an awesome ""prequel"" AND origin story... Only not just for the characters we thought it would be! It did well in telling a Spider-Man story w/out explicitly using him. Ezekiel Sims being the evil Spider-Man worked well. I just don't dig the obvious dubs (4/5Scales)"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Is someone able to explain to me how hard it is to take that is the pictures and did not use them to make a movie out of THESE pictures? Seriously, how can you change the characters so much from what they were in the comics, if you don't like the character then don't make it, why change it? I was disappointed because I could have spent my money on another movie"
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"I actually really liked this movie. Two of the scenes, the scene with the mum in the middle and the ending were really bad and contrived. But the rest was really well done. I loved how they depicted her abilities with seeing the future and the past and changing it."
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,I enjoyed watching this movie. a fresh story. I like the storyline. The acting of the cast is also pretty good.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,It's worse than she-hulk....
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,There is no enough fantasy like a regular spider-man movie instead is much more realistic and that was good. I enjoyed it
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Instead, ""Madame Web"" is a soulless cash grab that feels like it was made by someone who has never actually seen a superhero movie and decided to wing it based on a vague description they overheard at a bus stop.

In conclusion, ""Madame Web"" is a colossal failure on every level. From its lackluster performances to its cringe-worthy dialogue and abysmal special effects, it's a prime example of everything that can go wrong when Hollywood tries to cash in on the superhero craze without putting in any effort or creativity. Save yourself the agony and skip this one – your brain cells will thank you."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Is not that bad like the reviews say, I found it fun to watch"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Morbius was really better lol
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Not only one of the worst superhero movies of all time but one of the baddest movies ever made!
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,This is the best fan made film i ever watch.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It was definitely a movie….? Seemed low budget, so many random plot points, very in-cohesive.. wouldn't watch again except maybe in like a trashy movie marathon"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Sony. Man. You need to knock it off.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Seriously...Who asks for Madame Web, a laughable, zero effort, non entertaining comic book film that'll go down as 1 of the worst movies ever made. Even worst I have to put up with Morbius 2.0...(fake memes). A hard pass!"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Hard to follow and didn't flow, the scenes seemed rushed and the character building fell flat, when the villain spoke it looked like a badly dubbed kung fu movie, the mouth and words didn't match, too much reliance on action which was short and didn't fit. B grade at best."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Please make it stop.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,It looks weird and story is a mess.
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"the best super hero movie of all time

OFF ALL TIME"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,When it comes to marvel movies I'm the first person to give them the benefit of the doubt. But wow this movie was just awful. The dialogue is so cringey and the sound mixing is hard to sit through. The acting is so over the top yet so monotone and one note. The main villains acting performance is one of the worst things I've ever seen and I shudder to think how much he would have gotten paid for that poor excuse for a performance.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,IT SUCKED SO BAD I WOULD RATHER WATCH MORBIUS THEN THIS
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Why do I keep watching these movies?
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Just fantastic, the story, the characters, the costume design, and the cast all of it is fantastic. Madame web strays away from the average mcu slop and is one of the best movies marvel&sony has ever made. I cant wait for later this year when Venom 3 and Kraven the hunter releases to see how this universe expands!!"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,The only reason I see for giving this film such a high rating is the two great talents of Sydney Sweeney
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,BWAHAHAHAthey made aAHHAHAHAAm-madameHAHAwebHAHAHAmovieHA...HA...okay. okay. I think I'mHHAAHAHAHAA
"Feb 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Me gusto la película para pasar el rato, no sera buena o mala pero cumple con lo que prometío."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Oh geesh!! Was such cheesy and cringey dialogue and such bad acting! I have never thought DakotaJ was a good actress and every movie I have seen her in I don't know what it is but her voice, mannerisms, intonations, just all around bad acting, which could not be saved with such a bad script, -so add that to it! Just a corny movie overall to have waited all this time anticipating to see it at a premiere! What a let down!! Morbius was better by a long shot. Cheesy movie and cringey acting all the way around. Save your money to see this superhero movie gone bad and wait for the $2.99 price when it comes to streaming. Waist of time!"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"just overall extremely poor, very forgettable, good actors making the ""best"" of a bad script, just bad"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Worst comic book movie ever made. Rather watch fantastic 4 from 2015
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie is trash, it has no Amazing 
Story and no Message and there is no character."
