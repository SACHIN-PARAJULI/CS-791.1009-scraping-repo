"Apr 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"I've never been a huge Superman fan. Even as a kid I did not like Superman. I couldn't tell exactly what I did not like. But now I can. Superman was too much of a Mary Sue character for me.

Superman is still all mighty, yes, but the story was greatly told. With a good script, great visuals and even better actors."
"Mar 29, 2024",POSITIVE,It is the best Superman movie
"Mar 28, 2024",POSITIVE,man of steel define the dceu and visual effects in a superhero film it is good superman should not kill zod but this is great storyline great Russel Crowe is great Superman is starting to balance his alien heritage with his uprising as a person in humanity by his father John Kent this is great general Zod is the best villain by far in the DC EXTENDED UNIVERSE I will see it again
"Mar 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"A mi me pareci√≥ genial ,un superman fuerte pero lo que pone siempre en peligro a las pel√≠culas de Dc es su cambio continuo de actores ,cuando las personas nos encari√±amos con el personaje lo cambian sin importar la audiencia."
"Mar 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"The hate on this movie is unwarranted. The score is something special, the leads are incredible, the villain has a motive that almost warrants sympathy, the action MY GOD THE ACTION! The sheer sense of speed and power you get from flight is a feeling that fails to be replicated today. 2nd favorite super hero movie to this day."
"Mar 13, 2024",POSITIVE,Best comic book movie ever. Totally underrated
"Mar 7, 2024",NEUTRAL,This film is very conflicted this film does have a vision but this is a film this does not feel like a superman movie he has no emotion and everything is dark and gritty and i feel like WB saw how much money they made from the dark knight trilogy and they hired Zach for the film to make it dark like those films but it makes sense in the dark knight trilogy because Batman is a mostly dark franchise but with superman he is a symbol of truth but this film is not that.
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"Para mim √© a origem definitiva kripton √© magn√≠fica, trilha sonora elenco incr√≠vel"
"Mar 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie develops the Superman character in an amazing way. Showing the internals behind the Man of Steel, the motivations, moral dilemmas, and growth does an amazing job at humanizing Superman. This along with the great visual effects, amazing new suit and near perfect casting makes this a classic that I can watch over and over and never get tired of it."
"Feb 27, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie gets so much unwanted hate. When it's easily one of the best made.
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"This made Superman cool to me. It was the first time I didn't see him as a vanilla superhero, and after reading multiple comics I now like the character. This movie is quite good. CGI is very good, action is great, music is top tier, and I even think the story is quite good with some nice emotional moments, particularly with Jonathan Kent. I'm shocked this was rated so low by critics. A high recommendation, and the best out of the DCEU."
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"the best superhero movie I've ever seen, dark, serious, without cringe humor"
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,It was an all around great movie üé¨
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Definitely better on this rewatch (me and this film have been love-hate) but it's staggeringly great, definitely Snyder's best cinematography, and finds its footing with Clark in a pretty satisfying way, and Shannon is still the MVP when it comes to DCEU villains. I will say, the narrative is still weak in this and the stoic attitude doesn't fit right for Superman (at least to me)."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,"A.K.A. what Superman would have been like if Jon Kent was a paranoid ahole that taught Clark to prioritize his secret at the expense of human life, instead of compassion. But pretty."
"Feb 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Special Effects: 1,0/Sound Effects: 1,0/Acting: 0,5/Story: 1,0"
"Feb 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not a big fan of this movie, just not a big fan of Superman movies. Oddly, though, Supergirl is my favorite superhero."
"Jan 31, 2024",POSITIVE,"The most relatable Superman we've ever gotten on screen. He shows his human-side and heart. The villain being a fan favorite from Christopher Reeve's Superman II: General Zod, but unlike in Superman II, Superman and Lois don't send Zod and his henchman plummeting to their deaths with a toss and a punch after draining their powers in the fortress of solitude. In this version, Zod takes a more realistic and ideal approach Earth to find Kal (Superman) and Kal-El has a harder time fighting the intelligent and strategic General. Fueled by the anger of actions done by Kal-El's father, Zod hunts Kal down in hopes to rebuild Krypton. This movie not only is a poetic telling Superman, but it also shows us the best parts of what we love about the Man of Steel: His heart and his desire to do the right thing no matter how hard things get. Superman quite literally is a symbol of hope in this film. And for every comic book fan like me: eater eggs galore! And for those of you that want to see the best Superman fight scenes (PLURAL) in history, this movie more than delivers. It's got everything we want is an origin story pre-reassured Superman. This movie made me cry when I watched it. It was everything I wanted in a modern Superman film. Perfect part 1 of 5 in Zack Snyder's story-arc."
"Jan 30, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie is ahead of its time. Too much MCU funny colorful nonsense on the go to see past.
"Jan 30, 2024",NEGATIVE,Why does Zack Schneider suck so bad at making movies.
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,My favorite Superman movie. It's too bad they rushed his arc after this film.
"Jan 24, 2024",NEUTRAL,Casi no se le entienda a la historia te ponen el presente y el pasado no tiene sentido me u viera gusta que la pel√≠cula se llamara Superman
"Jan 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"Really just a great film that rivals the original Richard Donner Superman. Not just in quality but also in building/molding this superman into who we know, rather than just having superman right out the gate.
8/10"
"Jan 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is the best superman movie ever made, which is hard to say because I grew up watching Christopher Reeves.  This is also the only movie I liked in the Justice League film series."
"Jan 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"Absolutely a great film. We see the physical and emotional power of Superman as he makes a choice between humanity, and krypton."
"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Powerful, visually stunning. IMO, it only gets better with age."
"Jan 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Excelente pel√≠culas un Superman distinto al tontolon de siempre de las viejas pel√≠culas, Hombre de Acero es una de las mejores pel√≠culas de super h√©roes de la √©poca actual, a quienes esperan ver una comedia de super h√©roes est√° no es pel√≠cula para ellos, esta es una de acci√≥n  de super heroes, muy recomendada."
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"( Non spoiler review ) I thought this was a great movie! The plot was very good and the music was AMAZING ! I would definitely recommend this movie if you haven't already seen it, i would say it's not for children but if you think they're mature enough for it, it's really up to you. 5 stars from me, and the acting was really great too. ( sorry i'm a few years late )"
"Jan 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,Underrated regardless of its flaws especially regarding its tone and structure.
"Jan 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,Very depressing and dark movie. Superman was depressed throughout the movie. I missed the silliness of comics and the vibrancy of 80's movies
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,I personally thought that this version of Superman was well done and my favorite and more up-to-date and realistic as far as you can be with a flying man.
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,By far the best superman movie ever made !!
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Where does Rotten tomatoes get their ratings?? lol ‚Ä¶. This one is actually hilarious at a 56 rating. Best DC movie ever made. Outstanding cast. Greet script. Great director. I just come here to see what RT says because they're always wrong.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,Best Superman movie for sure
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Though a bit dark with not much humor, Man of Steel is a great action film."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,This Superman movie is the better movie. But the rest of the DCEU movies Sucked
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Epic!. Best adaptation of Superman I have ever seen. Dark gritty, and an amazing battle with general zod."
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Prefect casting. Perfect soundtrack. MOS is the best best superman film by miles.
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,We finally have an actor who actually fits the part. He showed raw emotion. The script was not perfect but we got to see the MoS actually kick some butt for once.
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Just absolute masterpiece and the music was so strong. 
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Have always been a batman fan n not a superman one but this movie changed that. The soundtrack is perfect acting is perfect. Thanks to this I now can say superman is awesome n wished they did man of tomorrow cause the guy in this was perfect cast. Can't remember his name but he is superman
"Dec 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,What happens when you take the most optimistic and hopeful character in DC's lineup and hand him over to one of the most divisive filmmakers in Hollywood? You get a film that completely misrepresents the essence of the character of Superman and what he stands for.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Revolutionary! The best Superman movie ever made
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"When I was a kid, watching this for the first time, I loved it, and I would've told you it's the best movie ever made. About 10-ish years later, while I wouldn't say it's the best movie ever made, I'm still in love with it, perhaps even more than back then. While the film has a very serious tone, it never really felt dark in my opinion. There were moments of course, but there was also a hopeful undertone. I also appreciate how human Superman feels. He's still a hero with the capacity for good, but he's also flawed in some ways, and doesn't always make the best decisions. The flashback sequences are some of my favorite moments as well, and yes, even the infamous ""maybe"" line. General Zod is also a great villain, with solid, understandable motivations that, while horrible, you feel as though he is doing what he knows is right, and Michael Shannon portrays him perfectly. The action is great as well, and never feels boring. When Superman destroys the first world engine, with that triumphant score in the background, holding his fist in the air, pressing forward with all his might, that is one of the greatest comic book movie moments of all time. Hans Zimmer also delivers an amazing musical score that, while not as good as the Williams' theme, works perfectly for the story they're trying to tell, and adds to the emotions of each scene. Overall, a great film, and personally, I don't understand why people hate this so much. Well done, Zack!"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the most underrated superhero movie of all time which was also way ahead of its time. compelling story, great action, amazing VFX and a great cast.

A must watch movie for superhero fans"
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Perfect as a comic book film of origin can get. Fantastic style, visuals, story, and a grand feeling."
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,This is my Favorite DC move. really really good.
"Dec 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie was a decent adaptation of the iconic superhero, but it had some flaws that prevented it from being a great one. The movie had impressive visual effects and action scenes, but it lacked depth and character development. The plot was predictable and the dialogue was clich√©d. The movie also had a dark and grim tone that did not fit well with the optimistic and hopeful spirit of Superman. I think the movie could have been better if it had more humor, emotion, and originality.

"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was awesome start to finish.  I never seen it when it came out because I heard it wasn't good. And it was still amazing in 2023 üòÇ.
"Dec 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Superman story. They humanize Superman by making the overdrive senses painful. Two final fight scenes should have been merged but overall keep coming back to this as one of my favorites
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was awesome. Some don't like the darker tone of the movie but I loved it. Michael Shanon's Zod was epic. I could feel the hatred and vengeance of his character coming through the screen. Henry Cavil was an excellent Superman and the one I will compare all other Superman's to. Overall a great story. However I didn't care for their choice of actress playing Lois Lane and sometimes the movie did drag a bit.
"Dec 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I love this movie, even though I know it's not a good adaptation. The fight scene between Superman and Zodiac is sensational, in my opinion it's the best action scene in a hero movie, and Zodiac is for me the best villain in the DCEU, and the scene of Superman flying for the first time is incredible. I've only talked about the good stuff for now, but now I'm going to talk about the things that annoy me in this movie, Jonathan's death annoys me too much because one of Superman's powers is super speed, he could take his father, but he doesn't, he watches his father die and Jonathan raises his hand saying no, I'm not even going to comment, I can't accept a Superman who kills, this movie also has a messy third act. Overall, it's a good movie, although there are some things that irritate me, and I give it a 7/10."
"Dec 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Watched the movie 10 years after. This movie was almost perfect. It was excellent entertainment full of the good emotional scenes audiences relate to. It would have been perfect if there had been reference to kryptonite
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the Superman I have always wanted to see. This was an amazing show that had incredible graphics and an honest storyline that I could enjoy. ALL the actors had me engrossed and entertained. So rare!
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love this movie, great"
"Nov 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Best live action representation of Superman ever. It's great looking at a Superman that is in a world similar to us and tackle through all the difficulties. Then getting to know of his inheritance and making sure it doesn't falls into villians' hands.
"Nov 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hard to tell why so many has giving the movie critics, but I loved it. This movie has by far the most iconic music theme of all I've watched. Everything about it I loved"
"Nov 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,O filme muito legal come√ßa bem deu todo o in√≠cio do dceu serve at√© que muiito bem gosto do muito do vil√£o tamb√©m o cgi e legal demais a origem e tudo mais do Superman contado at√© que muito bom tem algumas coisas que eu n√£o gosto desse filme como a atua√ß√£o do Harry que n√£o tem muitas rea√ß√µes as origens s√£o boas cenas e por isso acho que 3 estrelas s√£o bom para ele at√© agora e o √∫nico e melhor filme de origem do dceu que eu assiti
"Nov 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"A truely beautiful movie, loved it."
"Nov 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Um filme realmente bem feito, recomendo com toda certeza!"
"Nov 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"A very good portrayal of the man of steel. You can really see the human side with the doubt and pain, then rise above it. Really enjoyed it."
"Nov 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just perfect, I know some people say it was too dark & gritty, but as much as I agree that's not a bad thing it's just real and relatable (minus the flying)"
"Nov 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think that ist thes movie for Superman of the last years, Zack Snyders its a simply genious of the comic on screen"
"Nov 9, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the greatest superman movie ever made. Modern day super hero movies are almost comedies‚Ä¶ this one is not.
"Oct 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Must watch for all the superhero fans out there.
"Oct 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sorry, but this was a great movie, and equal to the first Superman, with Christopher Reeves!"
"Oct 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Aside from the flashy action and explosions, there's little to praise here. It really is that plain and boring."
"Oct 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Emo Superman.  This is better on 2nd watch, but no one has gotten the character quite right since Richard Donner.  Superman is the star quarterback captain of the football team who could steal most guy's girlfriends but doesn't because he's that noble even if she is a young Anne Hathaway.  Nobody has captured that since.  If only someone could translate the sensibilities in the character expressed in All-Star Superman by Grant Morrison I believe (sorry not the biggest CB nerd).

But for a CW Superman this was great.  It is actually the 2nd best film of all of them even better than the good 'Justice League' cut.  I feel if you aren't familiar with the 'classic' Superman, this one will be your favorite.  That's if you like Superman at all as many people think he's a wuss and cheap.

Grade:  87/100 B"
"Oct 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best comic book movies of all time, Cavill is Superman."
"Oct 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"DCEU Re-Watch for the last time Part 1. Man, imma miss Henry Cavil, even though he leaves some to be desired for his portrayal of Clark Kent, that‚Äôs more of a script thing than a Cavil thing. He really does excel in his Superman, controversial ending aside, he really does embody the stoicalness and natural integrity that Superman has to offer in my opinion. The casting of Kevin Costner and Diane Lane is peak parent casting, their performances give the audience the idea of where Superman gets his ideals from even though they have little screen time. Russell Crowe offers a deity like presence throughout the film, Lois Lane is done well by Amy Adams also, but the 2nd best casting easily is Michael Shannon. Easily the best live action Zod, is the perfect radical foil to Cavil‚Äôs Superman. You understand his motivations and purpose but still recognize that he must be stopped, he‚Äôs a great villain because he truly see‚Äôs himself as the hero here. The overall aesthetic of the film is what you expect from a Zack Snyder film, depending on how you feel about Snyders style will probably dictate whether or not you like the feel of the movie. The cinematography is amazing, as a pure Superman movie there is no equal to the fight scenes portrayed here, seeing Superman swoop in and use assess situations and pivoting literally on the fly, it feels so much like the comic book. In the future movies he shares the screen with others and it inevitably deters the action and his style away from him so, to me, this is really the only movie where you see him fight like this (another reason to despise the fact that Man of Steel 2 will never happen) The score is great, and even though the classic John Williams sound is missing, I do feel Hans Zimmer brings his usual big cockery to the table. Zimmer enhances the tone and his main theme feels heroic in an unheroic time of uncertainty. Snyder does the Man of Steel justice. I may not agree on his blanket view of seeing all these heroes as Gods, but Superman is definitely worthy of that tutelage. As a lover of both DC and Marvel, I don‚Äôt buy into the tribalism of picking a side, if given the proper treatment, we‚Äôd have Henry Cavil still, but it just wasn‚Äôt meant to be. So lets just enjoy that this diamond of a movie exists. Seeing this movie in theatres made me believe in Superman again when my fandom was falling by the wayside. Starting this last rewatch makes me kinda sad, I wanted to finish in time for Aquaman 2 but I was dreading starting this because it was really the beginning of the end. Oh well‚Ä¶ on to Batman V Superman! (Extended cut of course)"

"Oct 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"The sniffy critics with their Superman wouldn't act like that nonsense just show their utter lack of vision, unlike Snyder. There are so many alt Supermen time lines and stories why be harnest to just the 1940's butter wouldn't melt version? That was then and frankly this is now (my favourites 'heroes' being The Punisher and Wolverine so you see where I'm coming from here) and Snyder got the new reboot Superman, especially given the potential arcs that stream from his choice to kill to save, spot on. Loved this. Cavill IS Superman as much as the much missed Reeves was for a lighter time, just a different and more realistic version. The whole alt version concept worked a treat for me and the acting, script, direction, special effects and nod to a possible future time line were all superb. This was excellent and given the territory where I want Suoerman to potentially go, into much darker waters, a hopeful signpost of the turning realities. An underrated classic in my book. I'd personally like to see Kingdom Come or even the Injustice time lines made. That'd fu*k the Suoerman doesn't kill brigades into a froth."
"Sep 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,This doesn't FEEL like Superman. The film lacks heart and color. Superman acts very non-superman... in a superman movie!
"Sep 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Refreshing movie about Superman origins, but ut get darker to the end. You see Superman destroying the entire cuty during the fight with zod, not caring about the people. First he said that he fight for the people then he kills thousands, including zod. Snyder delivered us a selfish superman. Could be better."
"Sep 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"i like this movie so much it gave so much hope so much meaning to me. From its cinematography, score, visual effects everything is great. Its a must watch from me."
"Sep 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Superman movie. Casting is spot on.
Michael Shannon is awesome as general Zod and HC is a natural. Snyder revived Superman like Nolan did Batman."
"Sep 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the best Superman movie I've ever seen since it came out in 2013. I've watched it numerous times and it gets better every time I watch it. From the cinematography to the CGI, it ages like fine wine. Henry is divine and compelling in the role and I just wish that we could've gotten MOS2."
"Sep 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel is an Epic movie. Fast paced and visually appealing. Although there are some issues, but it's probably better than Anime?"
"Sep 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics are completely wrong. The most underrated superhero movie of all time.
"Sep 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"An excellent movie. Superman's journey to becoming a hero, every character introduced, the action, the cinematography, the special affects, and the plot, are all incredible. Their are no major issues to Man of Steel that cannot be explained rationally, and perhaps the only minor flaw is a very mobile Lois Lane that seems convenient at times; but other than that, this movie gets everything right for a superhero origin story."
"Aug 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Man of Steel provides a solid introduction to the legendary superhero with gorgeous visuals. Just like Cavill, the film takes a very stoic approach to Superman and mostly succeeds. My favorite parts of this movie are the individual scenes in the beginning and middle that show character-developing moments. It's a classic, well done origin story."
"Aug 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's not of the highest quality, all that necessary or the ""Superman"" film fans particularly wished for, but's an arguably fun time and a visually dazzling piece of cinema."
"Aug 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Snyder's take on Superman was the most relatable we've ever had. His darker gritty tone is welcome break from the MCU
"Aug 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,It does have it's heart and moments but Man Of Steel is a dry rip-off of Superman 2.
"Aug 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A load of cgi bingbangbong that doesn't add up to much more than a computer game sequence. Apparently superman also now loves just causing damage to everything for no particular reason, and just happens to be at the scene of random natural disasters all the time. Tosh."
"Aug 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have to admit I don't remember seeing this when it was released. 
I'm a Cavill fan and really enjoyed this!
The primary critics complaint being ""generic blockbuster"" would also apply to much of the Marvel movies with much higher critic's ratings. I must point out I like those movies too."
"Aug 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Will always be one of my all time favorite superhero movies. A perfect actor and perfect story for Superman. THE Superman.
"Aug 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ap√≥s longos anos sem um grande filme do maior her√≥i dos quadrinhos, Zack Snyder surge com uma ideia um tanto diferente para o Superman, um filme com tons mais realistas e sombras, algo que n√£o parecia servir muito bem ao her√≥i, mas que no final das contas foi bem executado. Aqui temos um Superman diferente, ainda aprendendo sobre o que fazer com seus poderes, al√©m de seus conflitos pessoais envolvendo sua ra√ßa, essa parte √© bem apresentada no longa, uma introdu√ß√£o coesa e at√© din√¢mica, por outro lado, o desenvolvimento √© um tanto problem√°tico. Zack Snyder sabe dirigir, e se tratando de aspecto visuais, ele realmente tem seu diferencial, mas para contar hist√≥rias nem tanto. Seu roteiro √© um pouco ca√≠do, possuindo alguns problemas e excesso de conveni√™ncias narrativas que fazem voc√™ se perguntar se aquilo est√° realmente acontecendo. Al√©m do roteiro falho, seus v√≠cios com efeitos visuais acabam sendo exagerados em alguns momentos, seja pela falta de cores ou pelo excesso de zoom e zoom out. Felizmente, esses problemas n√£o s√£o maiores que os acertos deste filme, sua trilha sonora √© memor√°vel e enervante, as atua√ß√µes s√£o boas, a fotografia √© linda e as cenas de a√ß√£o s√£o o ponto alto do filme, algo que ainda n√£o n√£o havia sido feito em qualquer outro longa dentro do g√™nero."
"Aug 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Perhaps the most grounded take and relatable Superman. The best superman movie by far!!!
"Aug 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was entertaining and pasted the time. I feel like it was a bit overrated though, because most of the movie was fight scenes and we didn't get much in depth of Clark Kent's life. This is how I feel about Dark Knight Rises also, but this one takes a little edge over."
"Aug 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Awful, this is a terrible representation of Superman, we barely cares about the causalities and collateral famage. Krypton looks horrible and the villains are no good."
"Aug 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Rewatched last night, this is so lifeless and dark. What a horrible mess.
Whomever was at the helm should not make another film, to be sure Henry Cavil is amazing as superman but a poorly cast Lois ( despite Amy Adam's charisma and talents) and for goodness sake a black Perry WHITE, what's the??? There will never be a white black lighting or White Power Man the characters that are  created in whatever color race or creed should stay that way. The villain is lame as is the story the pacing and overall theme is darkkkkk as said in the film the ""S"" symbol stands for hope in the Kryptonian language, sadly this mess has none üòï."
"Aug 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Better than both Superman III and Superman IV, but did not surpass Superman or Superman II. However, good movie. 5.3/10"
"Aug 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I think it was a good movie and I liked how superman was the first superhero on Earth and I like how they showed the military and all the people's reaction to a alien superhero.
"Aug 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Meh. Cavill is great, but this movie drags so much"
"Aug 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"My favorite superman movie ever, it has a deep story"
"Jul 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics got this rating wrong.  After all these disastrous Marvel Movies and shows, a reviewing of Man of Steel is like a detox for the brain and eyeballs.  It's spectacular and the storytelling is done so well.  I think back in 2013 critics were still clinging on to Christopher Reeves Superman movies and yes, those are great but Man of Steel is the best Origin story ever made.  Literally see the birth of Superman.  10/10"
"Jul 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despu√©s de 10 a√±os, ver nuevamente esta pel√≠cula con la atenci√≥n que se merece fue una gran sorpresa, la ame!!!
Es triste pensar que DC se nunca realizo una secuela."
"Jul 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I really wanted to like this film because I really admire Superman as a character but this was a massive disappointment. For a character whose main theme is ""hope"", there is not a single moment where anyone is happy, I can only think of the end where Superman and Lois smile but that's not even a good representation of happiness or hope. The beauty of the titular character is that no matter how super one is, he can still be relatable but that is absolutely not the case in this film. There are a minute amount of moments where I was like ""yeah, I can see that happening to me or someone else"" but there were more moments where I felt sympathy for him. I'm so confused at the final act because at times it seems that Superman goes out of his way to make more destruction which in turn means more people die for sure. This goes completely against the character and what he stands for even in this film.

The lack of Clark Kent in this film really hurts it because this dual identity would've added so much more depth to the character. In this film, Superman faces moral conflict, whether to save humanity or not but this isn't explored well in the slightest. The film gives zero reason as to why Superman should save the human race or why Superman believes he should, it actually shows quite the opposite.

Lois Lane is terribly written here and is so damn annoying that it makes me not care for anything to do with her. There is a huge lack of emotional weight in this film, I can count on one hand when I actually felt something when watching this, other than discontent. I found the film to have bland action scenes that consisted of just shoddy CGI, explosions and destruction. The dark tone of the film is something I'm a fan of, it's Zack Snyder having a different take on the eponymous hero but I don't find that to be the problem with the film.

The acting is uninspiring and it's a big surprise considering the star-studded cast. The cast, Henry Cavill and Michael Shannon most of all, try to make the best out of the poorly written and one-dimensional characters they are given.

The visuals in the film are great and most of the CGI is as well. The non-linear splicing of Superman as a kid and him becoming Superman is done well and adds depth to the character. The story is actually really good and throws around fantastic themes that are unfortunately never fully or even satisfyingly explored due to the sheer amount of them.

For a $225 million budget film, it's difficult not to feel underwhelmed and disappointed by the end result but it's definitely not a complete disaster, I think it's borderline on being a good or bad film, I don't blame you if you think this is great, and I don't blame you if you think this is terrible."
"Jul 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"From a storytelling standpoint, the movie has its flaws... the nonlinear storytelling does not work. However, it's a modern, grounded, and enjoyable interpretation of Superman mythology with breathtaking visuals and a fantastic score.

"Jul 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Unfortunately, Man of Steel falls into the Nolan superhero trap... The success of Nolan's Batman trilogy for some reason convinced filmmakers that a more gritty, dark move is what audiences prefer. This is wrong... However, Cavill's performance prevents the movies from being a total snooze-fest"
"Jul 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel is an extraordinary superhero film that surpasses expectations. 
Its exceptional performances, Henry Cavill as Clark Kent/Superman brings a remarkable depth to the character, showcasing both the vulnerability of the ordinary man and the strength of the extraordinary hero. Amy Adams portrays an intelligent and determined Lois Lane. Michael Shannon delivers a menacing and multi-dimensional performance as General Zod.
Action sequences that are nothing short of breathtaking.
Hans Zimmer's hauntingly beautiful score elevates the film to another level.
Simply put Man of Steel delivers an awe-inspiring and emotionally charged superhero experience that redefines the iconic tale of Superman."
"Jul 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Man of Steel presents a visually stunning and modern take on Superman's origin, but some may find the darker tone and excessive action sequences detract from the character's iconic charm."
"Jul 23, 2023",POSITIVE,There will never be a better superman.
"Jul 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It gets better everytime I watch. Not the cookie cutter superhero movie, with Clark's (Kal-El) struggle to deal with humanity let alone with the fight with the last of his people. Great cast, great acting, superb movie."
"Jul 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Top 3 superhearo movies and the best Superman movie till now. Henry Cavill as Superman is an amazing casting. I liked that this movie is more realistic than the previous ones, kind of gave me the feeling as if Superman is real. I also likes how raw and real the script was and the movie didn't shy away from emotions"
"Jul 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,eh it arlight........................................................  . . . .  . . . . . .
"Jul 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great cast who had to work with a very weak script. Too bad Cavill never had the chance to really soar as Superman.
"Jul 10, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the most underrated superhero movies ever.
"Jul 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What do you get when you make the Superman movie director be Zack Snyder, who is known for dark and gritty? Well, you get a dark and gritty Superman.
The movie is honeslty really good and even feels like an Epic at times, however the serious and dark tone just does not fit Superman at all. Nothing against Zack Snyder (as I said, the movie is very good). Instead, it seems like DC wanted a dark and gritty Superman since The Dark Knight did so well and didn't take into account that Superman is not supposed to be like that.
The other downside for me personally was the incredibly long runtime. The movie certainly feels like an Epic both in size and in tone and there were a couple parts where I was a bit bored.
All that aside, if you love the dark and gritty Superman, the movie is actually quite good."
"Jul 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Esse filme se traduz numa frase: 
Com grandes poderes vem grandes responsabilidades. O melhor superman."
"Jul 8, 2023",POSITIVE,The most underrated superhero movie ever.
"Jul 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I watched this in the cinema and really liked it. 
I thought I would rewatch it 10 years later.
A few things stand out.
1. The acting is first class. Surely this roster is better than any Comic book film, ever. 
2. It takes itself seriously, which I liked. Not the comedy you see coming a mile off now with the MCU.
3. There is no virtual signalling. A film made before it went into its craziness.
4. The effects hold up today. In fact I would say they are miles better than the recent Flash and take your pick from any MCU film of the last 4 years (Hollywood, treat the VFX people better, too little time, too much pressure and too little budget being paid to these VFX companies) = dross.
5. Dian Lane. 
I rest my case!
PS Cavill, I salute you"
"Jul 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Henry cavil is a good casting for superman, but the film itself is bad. The cinematography and the acting is bad and the angry and gritty mood for superman is just bad, and the villain Zod is not good either, I would not watch this film."
"Jul 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I cant believe they messed up everything after this movie
"Jul 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"It moved me to tears 
The music is haunting and majestic 
You believe that superman could come to earth 
And not since Christopher revee has a alien felt so warm and the best of the human race 
The only criticism I had with the film was the final confrontation as superman to me never takes the easy option and always finds a clever way to save everyone 
But this is a modern superman a superman who must learn how to be the hero all hero's look up to 
And I'm strapped in for the ride"
"Jul 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Es una de mis 5 pel√≠culas favoritas. La m√∫sica de Zimmer la hace a√∫n m√°s genial. Y tiene un incre√≠ble reparto lleno de actores muy buenos.
"Jul 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I adore this movie so much. Such an underrated masterpiece. I seriously don't understand how people hate it. The people that do hate it just don't understand it. I dare say it's better than anything that The MCU has made. It feels so much more believable than the typical superhero movie and I love how we get to see Superman fight Simone as strong as him which is stuff we didn't see as much with Christopher Reeve's portrayal. I will always love this movie from now till the end of time. Without a doubt a 10/10 no questions asked.
"Jun 29, 2023",POSITIVE,I love DC and Superman do this was the perfect movie for me.
"Jun 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best dc movies. Fully inspirational. Characters were so well written. Astounding visuals.

"Jun 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent portrayal of Superman and the fight scenes are outstanding! Some of the best I have ever seen in the Superhero genre to date!
"Jun 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Zach Snyder is a visionary with new costume, awesome action sequences, great storytelling, casting, classic music and an extraordinary performance by Henry Cavill. Loved the darker version!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I would again pay to watch it."

"Jun 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Best live action Superman there will ever be!
"Jun 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I think this movie was awesome I dont see why It has only a 50% rating
"Jun 21, 2023",POSITIVE,This is an incredible movie! Multilayered and with a very interesting plot. The visuals are amazing for their time. I wish I had the chance to see it when it came out in the big screen!
"Jun 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The amount of work and effort from everyone in this type of film, is amazing. Henry is perfect and his work ethic, alongside his co-stars is admirable. Love this film and a great watch, even to this day it holds up so well"
"Jun 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Superman movie period! A 10 year old movie cgi better than The Flash!
"Jun 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This is IronMan of Dc
"Jun 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A decent (not great) movie by Snyder. This film was only somewhat successful due to Christopher Nolan's involvement as a producer. Still, the grounded take on the Man of Steel could have been worse."
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Perfecta y hermosa  la visi√≥n de Zack Snyder
Desde el traje y cada detalle
Ver como cada evento tiene un significado y lo que con lleva es un deleite"
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Massively underrated
"Jun 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed it more the second time. It was a bit slow during certain times but, I think overall it was a solid film. I would enjoy a sequel."
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I saw this film at the cinema and rated it then.  Watching the film again, and in comparison to what we've seen since, especially as of late from Marvel, it's even clearer how good this film is.  Henry Cavil works perfectly for Superman and Michael Shannon is brilliantly terrifying as General Zod; plus what a stellar supporting cast (Kevin Costner is great casting as Jonathan Kent).  Warner messed things up by rushing world-building in the form of Batman vs Superman instead of a much-needed, genuine sequel to further establish this Superman.  Warner has made a lot of mistakes since the release of Man of Steel, many of which can't be undone; however, given the release of The Flash and the opportunity to course-correct this character, and bearing in mind Cavill is loved by so many of the DC fans, plus he's committed to the role; it's incredibly puzzling how they haven't found a way to move forward with him.  If DC thinks there isn't a market for a Cavill Superman film, what makes them think there is a market for a non-Cavill Superman.  Blue Beetle will likely underperform and James Gunn will not last as Creative Head for DC Studios."
"Jun 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Man of Steel is sometimes boring and does feel a bit dull but it's still an okay beginning to the Zack Snyder's Justice League Trilogy!
"Jun 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bored, slow  and  bad story, and so bad visual effects"
"Jun 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is definitely one of the best Superman movie of all time. The visual effects is good, the cast is outstanding, the story is great and the action scene was spectacular. It has the best action scene in a Superman movie. Henry Cavill was really meant to be Superman. The best Superman actor since Christopher Reeve."
"Jun 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie had many good and memorable scenes. I get the criticisms (too much CGI back and forth punching action at the end that could get old after a bit, Superman breaking Zod's neck and murdering him to save innocent people, etc.). But I feel like those were one of the only ways they could do things. I really liked how they handled Superman's origin story and how they made him as a kid, and the movie was really well acted and got quite emotional a few times! The casting was as good as it could've been in my opinion, plus the music. As far as DC movies go this was a good first installment and one of the better ones!"
"Jun 16, 2023",POSITIVE,A gritty re-introduction of Superman. I liked the tone of the movie. A contrast to MCU happy-go-lucky movies. Actions are awesome. Sometimes dialogues drag a little bit but it didn't bother me. I liked Henry Cavill a lot. We should get a Trilogy of this series.
"Jun 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Superman, to me, has never been about the mythical superhuman. Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive are nice, but all too two dimensional. For me the appeal has always been about Clark...the nostalgia and Americana. Yesterday's ideals for a man of tomorrow. Get those right and the rest as they say will take care of themselves. Man of Steel touched on those just enough for me to let my guard down and enjoy the movie. Cavill was actually believable as Superman, but more importantly as Clark. A beefed up role for Jor-El was also a welcome addition and I was quite happy with the casting of Russell Crowe. Jonathan Kent is one of my favorite DC characters and Costner was a great choice, but the part fell short of my expectations. And after the first hour of action and demolition the last 30-40 minutes, while earth shattering, lost their impact. But with all that being said I really enjoyed the movie in spite of myself. So without hesitation, I'd recommend it to anyone...enjoy the summer blockbuster and just maybe, you too will believe a man can fly."
"Jun 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,Man Of Steel revitalizes the concept of Superman with an innovative and fresh approach. It is a visually impeccable film with a soundtrack that takes it to the next level.
"Jun 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was a good movie I liked it.
"Jun 15, 2023",POSITIVE,It could be more but was awesome to see it
"Jun 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film is a masterpiece, Heny Cavill perfectly embodies the role of Superman, Zack Snyder has made an excellent film. The film is 10 years ahead of its time."
"Jun 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best comic book films of all time. So full of the spirit of Superman and has a lot of emotional resonance- as much as it has exhilarating action. Henry Cavill imbues a lot of heart in his performance as the character, and Michael Shannon's Zod is a chilling antagonist."
"Jun 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Finalmente, o filme do Superman que eu sempre quis assistir. Com todo o respeito ao antigo ator, mas o Superman antigo era algo chato, caricato e entendiante. Agora, posso dizer que o Superman foi, realmente, lan√ßado. Este corte me lembra muito a vers√£o de John Byrne para os quadrinhos."
"Jun 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Just rewatched and I stand by this movie knowing it some flaws and divisive choices made by Zack Snyder. I wonder if reactions to it would have been better if the color palette wasn't so washed out. A simple change that makes a huge difference. Some cool videos on YouTube where people have done this. Cavill was a great Clark Kent in my opinion and I feel Snyder did a fantastic job with the casting all the way down to minor characters. Looking forward to see what James Gunn does with the franchise going forward.
"Jun 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Thank god for Snyder hitting the reset button because we have a new Superman for the ages that's more grown up, edgier, and more real-world based post 9/11 era Henry Cavill as Superman, Russell Crowe as Jor-El, Ayelet Zurer as Lara, Amy Adams as Lois, Michael Shannon as Zod, Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, Andre Trautje as Faora, Diane Lane as Martha Kent, Kevin Kostner as Jonathan Kent Snyder along with Christopher Nolan reboots the last son of Krypton starting out of course on his home planet which falls apart due to the core failing using up their resources Jor-El warned the Council this would happen and now a coup is attempted by General Zod who wants to get rid of impure bloodlines to save their species He and his acolytes are banished to the Phantom Zone while Jor-El and wife Lara have given birth to Kal-El the first natural born in centuries Their only hope to send him away to Earth all while carrying the future of Krypton's inhabitants After Krypton dies Kal-El arrives on Earth and raised by Jonathan and Martha Kent in Kansas as Clark all while discovering his newfound abilities whether or not he should use them to help the world or face rejection by humanity As a grown up Clark seeks his answers from and a hologram of his late father guides him to be the best of humanity not letting Earth suffer the same mistakes Lois Lane runs into him asking for his story to be told and of course the government is worried General Zod arrives to Earth demanding for Clark's presence otherwise the planet will face annihilation From then on Clark shows how he can bridge the gap between both worlds Amazing action sequences, a terrific cast, beautiful music by Hans Zimmer, and they do take breaks to cover Clark's humanity Can the people of earth be trusted?, sometimes you have to take a leap of faith, choosing destiny is much different than being born into conformity, facing xenophobia is a consequence of letting the world see who you really are So much world building takes place giving Krypton its rich culture and politics I did get pretty teary eyed when it came to Krypton's destruction knowing Clark's parents will never see him grow up Many religious allegories even if they hammer it in a lot with Christian parables Cavill amazingly plays the part of an alien learning to balance being more than human and what it means to be human I didn‚Äôt buy the romance at the though Shannon is fierce and intimidating as Zod and has that Nazi mentality creating a master race colony of pure genes, he is a leader after all doing what's best for his people not believing he's villainous Genetic modification and artificial population control is also present The 2 hours and 23 min zips by fast There‚Äôs lots of debate with Superman killing Zod and the massive amount of destruction left in his wake but none of that bothered me A modern summer blockbuster with a more realistic look at the man of steel in our 21st century"
"Jun 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie has very interesting visuals and an amazing antagonist, but it suffers from a pretty basic plot and doesn't feel like a Superman movie at all. However it was a decent start to the DC Extended Universe."
"Jun 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a good cinecomic,it's not as good as the 1978 version but it's cast and it's vfx are really good.
Snyder's version wasn't so bad,we blame it for nothing"
"Jun 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"unpleasant experience,  boring and lacking of atmosphere and humour loaded with unnecessaryso called effects and deprived of any sense of adventure."
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best superman interpretation. Henry Cavill is the superman of our generation. And Zack Snyder is a visionary director. The introduction of Krypton is one of the best sci fi adventures I've seen. The dynamism in the camera movement, the flow of the story, the silent moments. This is not Christopher Reeves superman at all and it shouldn't. This movie deals with doubt, fatherhood and the childhood of basically a godchild. He is a savior or a destroyer and the world will have to cope with his existence and the chaos his presence in our world brings unintentionally. This superman is not given any easy tasks but a level of decision making that will define his future actions, his character and the way the world sees him as well.

About the cinematography this is a masterpiece. The fight in metropolis is so intense you can feel the destruction of the city and the true scope of what a battle between demigod aliens that are almost invulnerable feels.

Also I m glad Louis is a detective journalist that sees through the glasses and not a selfcentered ignorant that can't recognize a person in front of her.

Snyder definitely knows his comics and I am glad he knows more than just the basic. Superman is such a rich character you have all kind of stories that explore his identity beyond the boyscout concept. And so far no other movie has explored his human side. The cynical mockery of humanity interpreted by the clumsy coward reporter is not present here. Clark and superman are not different personalities. Always hated that idea because that is basically what makes batman be the vigilante he is. Superman should not have 2 personalities at all. One thing is to have different identities as he has: Clark Kent and Superman are simply differnet ways for the people to see him but he acts the same with the same values. How can he act differently. Innocence is lost with the first lie.

So to me this movie is a must for anybody that wants to see a fresh look at the mightiest superhero of all times, a modern look that will stick for generations to come and thanks to the great director behind the camera this is a movie that will be discussed for a long time as the moment superheroes evolved beyond the kid friendly marvel icons into the mature audiences that still believe."
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"after re-watching this movie, I wanted to leave a review, unfortunately, at the time, the movie was underrated, but over time, people began to love it, it is the best superman and the movie about him, I like Zach's vision of this universe, it's really a cool movie and I love it, the main thief is also great, I'm sorry that there are so many did not understand this movie"
"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Un de mes films de super h√©ros pr√©f√©r√©s
Excellente mise en sc√®ne"
"Jun 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"When I first watched this movie in middle school, I was very impressed. The visuals were fantastic. The action was intense. Well, that was about it I guess, but as I got older and kept re watching the movie more and more, the cracks started to form. Henry Cavill, though a good actor, wasn't given anything to work with. He's an absolute block of wood in this film, and we never actually get to know him outside of ""He wants to know where he came from"" and ""He doesn't want bad things to happen."" Which is super generic. Clark doesn't even appear bothered by the destruction in Metropolis when he and Louis are standing in a crater of ash but he screams like a madman after having to kill Zod. Why wasn't he so upset after using his laser vision on the Kryptonian babies and crashing Zod's ship into the city. Undoubtedly killing more innocents. General Zod, while at least performed with energy by Michael Shannon, is a nonsensical character. His motivation behind his actions in the latter half of the movie doesn't make a lick of sense. Why does Zod have to terraform Earth in particular? Why not just leave the solar system and find some world with no other lifeforms on it and do your terraforming there? This question is never brought up in the film and it's certainly the first thing that Clark (or heck even other Kyprtonians) would've asked. Or they could've just said ""Hey it's awesome that we can have all these insane powers from living on Earth. Let's just keep the planet the way that it is."" Pretty much what Zod does in Superman II, and it makes a lot more sense given his ego. 

Then there's Jonathan and Jor-El both not making their intentions clear either. Jor-El goes between Clark being a bridge between the Kryptonians and him just forging his own path. Jonathan similarly is very intent on Clark not getting noticed (to the point that he implies that Clark should let a literal school bus of children die) but also keeps saying that Clark has to figure out what he wants to do in life. Very mixed signals. Then there's the infamous Jonathan Kent tornado death. Every aspect of that scene is, as the kids say, cringe. Clark is comically arguing with Jonathon about farming, then a tornado shows up out of nowhere, then they leave their dog in the car to hide under an overpass (does that even work?), then Jonathon goes to save the dog instead of Clark even though Clark could've done it without suspicion, then when Jonathon frees the dog and hurts his leg, he just tells Clark not to save him. Again, Clark could've done it without drawing suspicion, and I refuse to believe that Clark Kent wouldn't take the opportunity to save his dad.

I think the biggest problem I've got though would have to be the insane amount of destruction in the final act. There was absolutely no need for Zach Snyder to show us hundreds of thousands of people dying horribly and building after building collapsing in Metropolis. To make matters worse, the ""plan"" that Superman and the government set up is awful. ""Let's split up and let Superman take on the terraforming machine in the middle of nowhere while the ineffective US military takes on the one in Metropolis that's literally killing people. Why not just have Superman and the military take on the one in the city at the same time? Zod needs both world engines to terraform the Earth so why split up and let more innocent people die? Why doesn't Superman seem fazed at all by how much destruction he's not only allowing but also engaging in? 

Anyway, this movie is trash. Even though I used to love this movie for a year or two, I can't really wrap my head around why so many people like this thing. The action is literally headache inducing and so destructive that it makes Superman look like a monster and it led to the abortion that is the DCEU. I recall a lot of supporters of this movie used to defend it by saying once the rest of the series is out it'll all come together. Well I guess that's never going to happen. Maybe DC should focus on making each individual movie coherent and good instead of hoping each successive movie will fix the previous one?"
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,The greatest 02 hours: and 23 minutes ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Happy 10th Anniversary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful cinematography, good script, and great performances by all the actors. The film touches on themes of humanity and love among others."
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As a lifelong Superman fan, I was so excited about his return to the big screen but this film had me having a tantrum in my seat.   There was so much wrong with it from the start that I almost left the cinema. 
Jonathan Kent's death should be the catalyst for Clark becoming a protector of humanity because, with all his abilities, he can't save his father from heart attack and human frailty.  But that's not the way it happens in this film and it's all downhill from there.  Henry Cavill looks the part but his character is badly written, as is Amy Adams' Lois.  The film lacks charm, is unduly serious and does not capture Superman's character at all.  Next time someone has a go at a Superman movie, please read some comics first!"
"May 27, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is packed with action and an amazing plot. The cinematography and background score is one of the highlights of the movie. Not to forget the amazing acting of the cast specially Henry Cavill. It's like he is not playing the role of Superman but he is Superman. Must watch.
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"No word....the answers is masterpiece in this movie,henry cavill is our superman"
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Generic but interesting. That is the way I would describe it. It stands out from the superhero crowd, but it isn't entirely that great. Superman isn't properly represented the way he really should be. I am more of a batman fan so I wouldn't really know. The 1st half is a part origin story, part generic dialog. But the second half. That is where things get interesting. It's just pure comic book destruction, and I love it. This is the reason I like this movie. I know Superman killing Zod is controversial, but to me, I think it is interesting. Superman has to actually make a difficult decision. It is nothing really special. But Henry Cavil is good. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is perhaps his best work. 
 Oh and that Terriforming machine is awesome."
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Before anyone douches on this movie saying, ""oh superman shouldn't kill so it's a bad movie"". There have been multiple times where DC heroes has broken that rule intentionally or unintentionally (cough the dark knight cough injustice). It's a good movie with awesome cast but it needed more in terms of writing and screenplay. For fans who doesn't care about how sacred the superman should act, this is your movie to watch."
"May 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"it is visually impressive superhero film that delivers exhilarating action sequences and stunning visual effects. However, it falls short in terms of its narrative execution, character development, and emotional depth. While it may appeal to fans of explosive action and grandiose set pieces, it struggles to satisfy those seeking a more profound exploration of Superman's character and his impact on the world."
"May 15, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the greatest movie I have ever seen zack snyder's vision for Superman was brilliant and Henry cavill's performance as Superman was perfect plus micheal Shannon as zod was amazing I loved everything about this movie it is perfect thank you zack Snyder for making this masterpiece!
"May 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"While I love Super Heroes, one thing I don't like much about SH films is that they feel unrealistic, and I am not talking about the special effects or the costumes.

Most superhero films feel like one-dimensional characters with one or two relatively deep issues they need to sort out, but never did I feel that they could truly exist in the real world.

I guess this is the influence of having Nolan as a producer. His Batman was definitely one of the most grounded characters in SH films. And it shows with Man of Steel.

Clark truly feels like a guy who grew up in Kansas, in a farm, who tried to hide his identity to avoid being exposed. His motivations are clear, and his decisions do carry a lot of weight.

This is more than a Hero's Journey. It feels like a guy who was forced to become a hero to protect his world.

Also the special effects and action scenes are some of the best I have ever seen in my life. Just wow."
"May 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"By far the BEST super hero stand alone film to date. The first act alone is memorable 10 yrs later. Watching krypton's finals days still sends chills. This is a semi annual watch. A grounded superman based on realistic choices and not beholder to the tired and campy and old reeves version has been a breath of fresh air. This movie, as much as some hate it, is still talked about to this day. The most perfect casted Superman unfortunately wasted by the dc heads. The first flight is beyond words. Seeing superman push himself beyond his limits with such a perfect score sends chills down my spine"
"May 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie have a great visual even though i hate that blue filter, make everything not stand out enough. The story is not good enough to show how awesome Superman is, here he just look gloomy, yeah his Pa Kent already have bad influence on this Supes tho. The final scene kinda make me hope to see the ""real"" Superman but the sequel is just become more and more gritty. Kinda shocking to see Cavill look more like Superman in real life than in the film"
"May 7, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Superman movie ever
"May 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Easily one of the best DC and Superman movies to ever be released. Revees will always be Superman, but if anyone was to dawn the cape, it was Henry. Beginning to end the movie takes a more mature and emotional road. The movie is relatable, but not for everyone. I may not have powers, but I can still relate to the struggle. But I'ma keep it short. Just watch it if you haven't, you won't regret it."
"May 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The problem with this movie is it's not actually bad, if you didn't know who the movie was about. This movie damaged the public's view on a hero who is supposed to bring hope, justice, and light to lift the public. Instead, we got a dark gritty movie that didn't need to be dark and gritty with scenes that made no sense."
"May 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not the best plot, ruined superman from the comics"
"May 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"While it is not the best Super man movie ever, it is firmly Number 10. In all of my 67 favourite Super hero flicks‚Ä¶And that's good 
Man Of Steel is an AWSOME movie"
"Apr 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie ever filmed. Hope DC keeps it up and stays on course.
"Apr 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The most realistic Superman so far. Great movie!!!
"Apr 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the definitive version of the modern Superman, the last son of Krypton. Ultimately, a pacifist because he is too powerful to even punch other humans. Man of Steel is the story that challenges and deconstructs the concept of a hopeful Superman to its very core."
"Apr 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Excelente pel√≠cula de Superman y excelente interpretaci√≥n de Henry Cavill llevando el conflicto interno de qu√© puede hacer y qu√© debe hacer. Adaptado a.los.tiempo modernos d√≥nde todos tenemos conflictos por alguna u otra raz√≥n.
"Apr 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel manages to deliver the true modern take on the classic superhero we know and love while maintaining its core essence of what made the hero iconic to begin with. Hope, Courage and Strength.

The story is amazingly crafted, from how Kal-El was born to how he becomes Superman in our world.


See it by yourself and enjoy it!"
"Apr 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Yup my favorite hero
"Apr 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is the perfect modern adaptation of the mythical character of Superman.  The reason some people didn't like it is because they only like popcorn superhero movies.
  Instead, this movie makes you think about decisions in life and how that affects others.  You have a journey with the main character through his emotions instead of a random ""hero"" fight.
  10/10...by the way Christopher Reeves' Superman also killed Zod."
"Apr 5, 2023",POSITIVE,The definitive Superman for a contemporary audience.
"Apr 2, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved how they included more of Superman's world where he came from and add more depth to his character. Good job!
"Mar 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"con grandes escenas de acci√≥n ,excelentes efectos especiales , la historia de superman algo oscura para empezar la adaptaci√≥n de superman pero muy disfrutable y bien manejada ,en realidad me pareci√≥ muy entretenida un inicio para el dceu que hiba por buen camino ."
"Mar 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Superman actor ever. Zack you are the man.
"Mar 27, 2023",POSITIVE,A realistic version of Superman.  Loved The 1978 version.  Love this version.  2 different takes on the same character.  I love seeing my childhood characters come to life. Don't ruin the future Mr. Gunn!
"Mar 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Man of Steel put the DCEU off to a good start! It portrays Superman as an alien who wants to be human but stands up for his adopted home when it's threatened!! I don't understand why MoS got such a lousy score!
"Mar 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not true to Superman's character, a cold treatment of the most iconic DC hero. Instead of being the idealistic farm boy who wants to help humanity he was portrayed as an arrogant jerk while Lois Lane, instead of being the sharp witted sarcastic investigative reporter was a sappy girl with a crush. The worst line of dialogue in movie history occurred in the film. Superman and Lois are about to kiss. She says, ""I hear it's all downhill after the first kiss."" He says, ""that's only if you're kissing a human."" She is a human, you moron. Congratulations Superman. You just insulted her. You told her it will be downhill for you but not for her. 
Absolutely the worst."
"Mar 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"A realistic version of how humanity would react to a being with the power of a god. Fantastic, well made movie with solid performances from the cast. Cavill will always be my Superman"
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"No doubt one of the greatest DCEU movies I've watched. Action is great I think that nothing is wrong with this action. Acting I think the acting is good. CGI is great-perfect. Villain, I like General Zod but I think the Terrance Stamp should have been cast as General Zod because he has portrayed General Zod before and nailed/perfected it in SUPERMAN ll. Writing I think that the writing was good it could have been better in some parts but I overall like it. Story/Plot , I will always love a Superman story the guy is literally from another planet story is perfect. Characters, the character I just really don't like is Lois Lane I like every character more than Lois Lane I mostly think it's because Sophie Turner could have played Lois Lane. Character development I think would go to Clark because Clark never really used his powers until now to fight off Zod and become Superman then later in life join the JL. Adventure I think it was ok. Mystery wasn't so good. Ending, I think that the ending is perfect I love this ending I'm not sure about you but I love this ending."
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great superman movie, the best till date"
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love this movie so much! It's sad that people cannot understand that this movie wanted to represent a real world! The last fight between Kal and Zod is fully of destruction and we see people dying, because in the real world we definetely would see these things!"
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing superman movie this is my favorite superman film.
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Man Of Steel is my best movie ever made in the world, this movie made me lose depression and seek hope in my life, such a Diamond movie."
"Mar 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"David S. Goyer had no idea how to write a modern Superman story. He tried to deconstruct the character without constructing him first. Snyder's directing is fine, but his style is so generic it left little impact. Little character development, poor pacing, and completely unfaithful to the comics. The closest you got to a scene with Superman in it which was accurate was him learning to fly. Cavill's smile was so real, you would believe he could fly."
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best adaptation of a superman movie there is, Henry Cavill IS Superman, the devotion and love for the character is clear"
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't care what ppl say this movie is great a must see !
"Mar 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"With Zack Snyder's Visual storytelling and Cavill's performance shows exactly why this movie is amazing. The action is fantastic, getting to know this version of superman and what he stands for is awesome. You actually get to see superman punch someone. This superman actually deals with consequences of his actions. Such an amazing movie"
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this movie. The cinematography is beautiful, the soundtrack is fantastic. Henry's Superman is definitely a more emotionally vulnerable Superman, and there's nothing wrong with that. Took one star for the dumb scene with Kevin Costner, but other than that one scene, he played Superman's dad very well."
"Mar 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I don't hate this movie. It is what it is, but it's watchable at the very least."
"Mar 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I watch it a year ago for the first time, and it was nothing amazing, kinda boring for a superman film, fight scenes were cool but they didn't come until the end. Bit slow pacing for a superhero movie. The story was fine nothing special, also a very grey-looking film. henry as superman just feels right for some reason though."
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Quite simply a masterpiece

"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Just DOPE !!!! The movie was well written with a different take on Superman which is so cool.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One of the stupidest movies ever made.

This review is going to be full of spoilers because I am going to mention various gaping plot inconsistencies and outright idiocies in this dog of a film.

Sure, it looks great and the special effects are generally well done. But some people need their movies to at least make some sense.

Let's start with a really basic one: the planet Krypton is going to be destroyed, and no one can be saved except one baby, presumably because they don't have any spacecraft.

Oh but wait, they do have spacecraft. In fact, they have so much spare technology they use it to send criminals into space... so that they will survive and provide enemies for Superman later in the movie.

Jor-El steals the Codex, which apparently contains the DNA of the Kryptonian race. Somehow, there are no backup copies. Oh but what about the actual Kryptonians who are running around destroying things... surely they each have their own DNA? Apparently not, somehow. And how about that baby-making machine in the scout ship: what was it supposed to use if there's only one Codex?

Clark just happens to hear about some top secret ice digging, and somehow knows to go there. How? And Lois Lane is somehow given a tour of the dig and a free place to stay even though she had to sue to be allowed there at all.

Clark discovers the spacecraft and somehow knows how to pilot it and land it somewhere. But then it never gets used again, for example to help fight the invaders later on. Doesn't it have the same kind of engine that's needed to destroy them? And it actually can fly rather than needing to be dropped via an airplane, as Clark's baby spacecraft is at the end of the film. But somehow no one thinks of this.

When Clark is taken to General Zod's ship, he loses his powers because he supposedly needs the gasses in earth's atmosphere to gain and retain his powers. Yet he's shown repeatedly operating in the vacuum of space. If he needed Earth's atmosphere to retain his powers, he should lose them in space.

In numerous fight scenes, massive damage is caused to probably inhabited buildings, which must have resulted in massive loss of life. Why wouldn't Clark/Superman immediately lure his enemies far away from the city, fight over the ocean, in the mountains, etc? In one scene he deliberately throws an enemy through a bunch of buildings, apparently not caring who gets hurt.

At the end, when the world engine is working, Superman flies into its gravity beam where his powers shouldn't exist because the conditions it's creating are like those of Krypton. But after being unable to do anything, he somehow just decides he's going to do it, and then instantly destroys the machine. Because if you really really decide, then you can do anything.

General Zod's ship will be flipped back into the Phantom Zone if its drive field comes in contact with another drive field of the same type, as found in Clark's baby spacecraft. But wait, don't all their small spacecraft use the same engine? Why don't they cause the same problem?

At the end, Superman and General Zod have an extended fight and appear to be equally matched, but when Zod threatens a prototypical family of Father, Mother and Child with his heat vision (and which he somehow doesn't manage to hurt although all he'd have to do is move his eyes slightly), Superman easily kills him, although he was completely unable to damage him until then. Again, just deciding to do something makes it happen.

These are just some of the really obvious major problems, how about some minor but equally stupid ones?

Perry White, Jenny and Steve are walking away from General Zor's ship when Perry says ""where's Jenny?"" Oh, she's suddenly stuck under rubble that apparently no one noticed falling, and she hasn't bothered to scream or make any sound at all. They struggle to free her, when suddenly the beam stops and they say ""He saved us!"", even though they didn't know anything about Superman trying to save them, nor that the destruction wouldn't resume, or in fact anything about what was going on.


Martha Kent is violently flung 20 feet or more. But apparently she's completely unhurt even though she's elderly and even a simple fall should have been damaging.


When Superman and Zor are fighting, they fly a great distance and end up falling through the ceiling of something that looks like Grand Central Station. After a few seconds, Lois Lane suddenly appears out of nowhere, because she should be in that scene.


In a 'heartwarming' scene at the end, Jonathan Kent sees young Clark playing with a cape and gets all misty eyed. Wait, how did he associate a kid playing with a cape with anything at all? Why would a cape signify something to him? It wouldn't.


This is a movie that didn't bother to make any sense, and the fact that people accept all the illogic, plot holes and dumbness of it really depresses me. Special effects shouldn't be enough to make a movie popular. The story and the logic of the story should count for at least as much and more."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie so far. What could have been. Ruined a chance with a great actor and story by forcing a team up. Really wish they had taken their time to build these characters out the way they should have.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,the movie speaks for itself!!
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie is fun and Henry Cavil is an amazing Superman, but the movie isn't really a superman movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Henry Cavill's performance in the film was enough to keep viewers entertained. Although others complain about the character development and the dark tone and emotion that Man of Steel evokes, I enjoyed the numerous action sequences and Micheal Shannon's version of Zod. If only this movie was completed with a sequel, it may redeem itself despite low critic scores."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"one of the best takes on Superman in my opinion, original and refreshing origin story and by telling it non-linear it kept the movie surprisingly at high pace and really entertaining. What more can you ask for as a comic fan ?"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it..Henry Cavil is superman
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel was a solid Superman movie was it the Superman I knew from the comics or cartoons I grew up with? No but it was a very real one, a man with the power of a god in a world that could send the world into a frenzy. I thought Henry did a fantastic job with what he had."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Que gran pel√≠cula, la acci√≥n visual esta a otro nivel, el cgi es espectacular, una de las mejores de la √©poca."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Screenwriting! Direction! Out of league view!!
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Best DC to date !!!!
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,If u wanna watch good fights I recommend this one
"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best and most underrated CBM there is and the best Superman movie to ever come out.
"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best superhero movies to this day for sure. Ten years later, the special effects are still unmatched, the most stunning you will ever see. The entire alien technology aspect is mind blowing. The movie has a super simple plot : Crypton blew up and the survivors want the Earth, only Superman can stand in their way. There is great beauty in such simplicity, something Snyder might have forgotten at some point. This movie is a masterpiece."
"Feb 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've just watched man of steel, 10 years after its launch. I'm not a fan of generic super hero movies, try to be selective of the ones I watch, and don't accept easily changes of actors and reboots (example Spiderman have not watched the ones without Tobby M. and Batman refuse to watch them without Christian Bale) And WOW, what a good surprise it was MoS! The back story on Krypton, the construction of Clark as a boy, his struggle with his powers. All really great: great story, great directing and great acting. I understand now why Henry Cavill is THE Superman of this generation. And I admit imagining someone taking the place of C Reeves took me some time to accept. The only thing I've missed in there was more of a Superman earthling with daily problems, as his appearance was fighting aliens only. Looking forward to see other installments, as long Henry Cavill is Superman!"
"Feb 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a perfect Superman film. It's not cheesy, the pacing is well done. It's dark. Yea I know Superman in general is lighter than this Superman film, but it works well with Man of steel. Rating 10/10 Go buy it on Blu-ray"
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Casting: 10/10
Gui√≥n: 7/10
Historia: 10/10 
Desarrollo: 8/10
Zack nos da un Superman al que recordaremos como el superman de nuestra √©poca duela a quien le duela"
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel is a 2013 superhero film directed by Zack Snyder. The film stars Henry Cavill as Clark Kent/Superman and tells the origin story of the iconic DC Comics character. The film is visually stunning, with impressive special effects that bring the action to life on the big screen. Cavill delivers a strong performance as the iconic hero, capturing both the strength and vulnerability of the character. The film's supporting cast, including Amy Adams as Lois Lane and Michael Shannon as General Zod, also gives standout performances.

The story is well-paced, with plenty of action and emotional moments that keep the audience engaged. The film's themes of identity, belonging, and sacrifice are well-explored and add depth to the story. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is also noteworthy, adding to the epic feel of the film.

Overall, Man of Steel is a solid entry in the superhero genre and a must-watch for fans of the character. While it may not be the best Superman film, it's a solid foundation for the DC Extended Universe and sets the stage for future films in the franchise. If you're looking for a thrilling and visually impressive superhero film, Man of Steel is definitely worth a watch."
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Joseph Campbell's the hero's journey as told as an alien first contact story. Man of Steel is easily one of most well made superhero origin stories.
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Henry Cavill... What's not to love.
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,My all time favorite Superman movie. Love Snyder's epic take of the Man of Steel.
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,What if there was a Superman among us? This movie will take you through the gritty journey of Superman where he is challenged with choices. Not for everyone though.
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"My favorite comic book film ever made. Zack Snyder took the legend of Superman and adapted it into a hyper realistic sci fi epic, a grand scale interpretation of our greatest superhero. 10/10"
"Jan 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"More face punching, less zooming in on this dudes bad-acting face. ‚Äú5 star movie if it had better acting, better story, Better action and didn‚Äôt have a shaky camera. ‚Äú-my boy "
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Henry Cavill IS the Man of Steel. Big fan of how he portrayed the character. Love Amy Adams as Lois Lane! The only scene that made me not give it a 5/5 is the scene of Jonathan Kent and the tornado. I think that scene should have analyzed more before doing it. I get the message of the scene but it could have been done in another way.
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Glad this happened during my lifetime. Awesome, believable movie with the best Superman I've seen. I never like Superman until Henry. I will miss superhero movies like this. I like the entire cast in this. I really love it!"
"Jan 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Decent acting, fair screenplay, competent special affects.

Neither hot nor cold.  

Better then the 1980s superman movies at least."
"Jan 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie has some great effects, great costume design and great acting.... yeah, that's about it really. This movie is really boring. The effects are great, but the action has no weight when Superman fights Zod fight in the air for an hour. There is just nothing exciting about this movie. Its has some nice effects, acting and costume design, but their is nothing to keep me invested."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"4.5: Incredible Movie üòé

Fantastic Movie Buy Now And Enjoy"
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best Superman movie ever made, Man Of Steel. One of the strongest hero finding himself. Not all battles are physical fights. Fights can be an internal battle. The fights were outstanding. The movie sticks to the original source. It maybe slow paced in the beginning but that's with any superhero movie when building up the characters story. I'd like to see Man Of Steel 2 if its ever made."
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Even though this is essentially a remake,  it's an excellent remake. Caville was born to play Superman and delivers the most iconic version of Superman to date. Great cast and acting a wonderful visuals. Love it."
"Jan 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,I don't know how Superman can be made so dull.  The story was so plodding.  The world was so devoid of color and life.  What is the point of saving a world so drab...

"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Easily the greatest superman movie ever made, Cavill was born to play this role, Synders vision is truly breathtaking, the score is inspiring.

110% my favourite solo superhero film of all time, thank you Zack for this piece of magic."
"Jan 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A very different Superman, more serious, more human. I liked it, but for me, he was a bit to serious, the film felt very dark, and the final battle was far too long. It was an Ok movie, but it's not a very memorable superhero film.
3 Stars from me"
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"My favourite superhero movie of all time, with the best fight scenes of any superhero movie I've seen. Cavill was born for the role and will always be my #1 Superman, just a shame he wasn't given better movies for it after this one."
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,At first the movie had its problems with the pacing but once the action started I couldn't get my eyes off the screen.
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie from Snyder, Goyer and Nolan. Perfect visuals and nice character played by Cavill."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Henry cavill is soooo talented and he mad the movie 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,another execelent movie of the genius DC
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Watched this again over Christmas. Long, but really enjoyable."
"Dec 30, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I was unimpressed the entire time I watched this movie. It appeared as though they were so enthralled by the spectacular effects that they forgot about anything else. Why every film on a comic book hero feels the need to go back and give their version of the origins is beyond me. We already know the origins of the movie if we are watching it, maybe in greater detail than the director and screenwriter. Before there was a chance of a new story line, it took at least forty minutes. The next 25 minutes or so were spent on special effects. So, I had an hour to write a new story. There is simply not enough time."
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Henry Cavill is perfect as Superman. Iconically represents the character. Decent plot with good action scenes.
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,Henry was the best superman on decades
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,Epic! Perfect and only Superman. We need more 
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"The beginning of the DC universe with Man of Steel was the most successful. With Snyder's direction, it was possible to give the idea that something big was coming for the future of DC."
"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,"CBM masterpiece, perfect!"
"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,The Best Superman movie ever. Period.
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"Heart-felt, has great action, and is beautifully shot. Zack Synder doesn't miss. Great CBM!"
"Dec 18, 2022",POSITIVE,Love it. Great story and great cast and characters
"Dec 17, 2022",NEUTRAL,"It has interesting ideas that it makes work more than it misses. The darker tone works for the most part, some of the action scenes work very well also. The Krypton opening and Superman are the two best things in this being solid overall. The editing of Clark's childhood and upbringing I feel could have been done in a more linear fashion, the music is generic, the ending does get a bit over the top with CGI and Lois/Clark don't have much chemistry. There also some questionable scenes like his father not letting Clark save him or some bad product placement. But it was entertaining the whole way through. Is this a masterpiece? Not even close. Is this a decent entertaining movie? Yeah it Is. Judging by how everyone has an opinion on this especially should speak merits to entertainment value. If your a fan of Super Hero films or Action films give this a try. It's Not Bad."
"Dec 17, 2022",POSITIVE,"This film is such a great upgrade to all other Superman films before. Henry Cavill is just the right actor for the modern man of steel and this film delivered in spades. Great acting, great score, and superb action scenes. You can't ask for more."
"Dec 15, 2022",POSITIVE,The most underrated comic book movie ever made.
"Dec 13, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Whilst Man of Steel certainly excels in terms of its action sequences, its characterization and story could had been better."
"Dec 12, 2022",NEUTRAL,Good acting. Decent story. Fun watch
"Dec 11, 2022",POSITIVE,One of the BEST COMIC BOOK/SCI FI MOVIES I have EVER SEEN!!!!
"Nov 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"A visually stunning, realistic and modern take on arguably the biggest superhero of all time. Didn't care for superman much until seeing this version. Snyder sure knows how to shoot a scene especially create epic battles. This IS cinema."
"Nov 28, 2022",POSITIVE,This is by far the best Superman movie I‚Äôve ever seen. 
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Didn't like at first, but a second showing made me a Snyder fan. The thrill of his first flight was exhilarating. The fighting effects were excellent. Everything a graphic novel should be sans the fluff and dumbing down for children. No boy scout here."
"Nov 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,I give it 2 stars for showing how Superman had relatively higher moral standards. I give it 1 star for changing the origin story of Superman.
"Nov 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"Solid and gritty reboot of the Superman franchise.  As opposed to the ever present and overdone humor in the Marvel cinematic universe, this film really does a good job presenting the ""gravity of the situation"" of having super-powered beings running around in your locality.  Love the darker tone that Snyder brings!!!"
"Nov 21, 2022",NEUTRAL, The same ingredients for Batman Begins are used here as well. It‚Äôs just not as good.
"Nov 21, 2022",POSITIVE,The movie is Just Beautiful.
"Nov 17, 2022",POSITIVE,no me gustaba superman hasta ver esta pelicula. tienen un buen cast de actores y una vision diferente a la que se habia planteado anteriores veces con el personaje.
"Nov 16, 2022",POSITIVE,"I love this Superman movie. Based off Bronze Age  Superman from John Byrne and co. It has action,drama,horror, and buts of humor dashed in there to chive the audience that fee hood energy that Clark/Superman exude. Plenty of tear jerking moments and leaves you with that feeling like the movie touched a special place in your heart. It sends a message of hope & leaves you wanting to see more. A proper origin story into his first battle. In a lot of ways Zack Snyder pays homage to bits of the first 4 movies eaturing Christopher Reeves in MOS and BVS. f. I think it pays tribute to those movies in their own unique ways."
"Nov 13, 2022",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie, superman looks really good, the story is amazing and the battles are full of action."
"Nov 12, 2022",NEGATIVE,superman seems cool but the plot is dumb
"Nov 11, 2022",POSITIVE,A pure Masterpiece. From the Cast to the soundtrack to the cineography.
"Nov 10, 2022",POSITIVE,Criminally underrated.
"Nov 10, 2022",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel, in my opinion, is the best Superman movie ever made. The competition is not very fierce, as I don't have a deep love for the Christopher Reeve films.

The introduction to the Clark's character is simple yet complex. The beauty of this film is in the flashbacks. From the bus crash to the tornado, every cut scene had a purpose and was on point. These moments created an emotional depth to the character and helped make Superman human (something the other films struggled with).

The casting is superb with Henry Cavill perfectly fitting the part of Clark/Superman. Amy Adams is also excellent in her role, as is the majority of the cast. While the first two acts of Man of Steel are first-rate in character development, the third act completely falls apart. The high level of destruction and the endless flying fight scenes are unnecessary and detract from the story.

Superman's human moments are by far the best parts of this film. While I understand that big, bold action sequences are ""essential"" in this genre, they could have been toned down a bit (i.e., Winter Soldier). I love pieces of this movie, and when I look back on Man of Steel, that's what I focus on.

Best Character: Clark
Best Scene: First Flight
Best Quote: ""The world is too big, Mom."" - Clark. ""Then make it small."" - Martha.
Best Piece of Score: ""Flight"""
"Nov 10, 2022",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, Perfect casting and story."
"Nov 10, 2022",POSITIVE,Amazing movie for sure!!
"Nov 9, 2022",POSITIVE,"This movie brought to life how Clark Kent came to be the man of steel, and it was wonderful acting by all the cast. Starting from the man of steel him self to general zod."
"Nov 9, 2022",POSITIVE,Materpiece.  Best superhero movie of all time!
"Nov 6, 2022",NEUTRAL,I think it's the best movie Snyder ever directed. This is the superman for 21 century!
"Nov 6, 2022",POSITIVE,"I still don't understand why people don't like this movie. Especially after years of having to go through the tedium of all these bland super hero movies with generic plots. Man of Steel actually tried to do something interesting and unique and it succeeded. I was never interested in Superman, but this movie made him a favorite. Henry Cavill and Zack Snyder make a great pair. I can only hope we get more one day. Though I don't hold any real hope."
"Nov 6, 2022",POSITIVE,"This film is incredible on so many levels, let me explain! 1: Henry cavill is perfect as superman, so much hope and such a fresh performance! 2: The origins are exceptionally done, with such energy and class 3: Snyder presents incredible cinematography, thrilling action and memorable moment after memorable moment. Overall this film acts as a great beginning to the DCEU, and with great pacing and use of flashbacks, strongly resonant themes and an incredibly talented team, this character piece is an easy recommendation and a genuinely incredible film!"
"Nov 5, 2022",POSITIVE,Incredible movie! Criminally underrated.
"Nov 5, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great story, This movie was not bad after all. I'm excited for the sequel"
"Nov 3, 2022",POSITIVE,"Almost 10 years after the premiere of this film, we should learn to recognize the work of Zack Snyder, personally I am not a fan of Zack Snyder, but in this film he did a great job, he developed the character and taught us values, he taught us why of the character, the reason for his behavior, the reason for his principles, definitely a movie with good special effects, with an incredible direction, Henry Cavill does a good job, the supporting actors do too, the icing on the cake is the band sound by Hans Zimmer, it's spectacular, and makes us enter the climax of the film, this film is underrated, I'm a fan of Marvel, but I recognize that this is one of the best above Marvel, I hope the sequel."
"Nov 3, 2022",POSITIVE,"A masterpiece and ahead of its time. DC has always had a dark vibe and never been as colorful and fun as MARVEL. Here you get real consequences when beings with superpowers fight each other. Destruction and collateral damage are only staged in a logical and epochal way. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is epic and pulls you in.
I celebrate the film now more than ever. Hanry is perfect and even a comic nerd who loves this role and stands by it. In Man of Steel, the character goes through a real evolution and you learn the reason why Superman vowed never to kill again. He was forced and saw no other way out. But repeating it would never be an option again. I understood the film, which many others didn't want to or couldn't understand. Zack Snyder got it right and only today more and more voices are being raised to see it the same way as many others next to me. #restorethesnyderverse"
"Nov 3, 2022",POSITIVE,This movie is a masterpiece! It always have been.
"Nov 2, 2022",POSITIVE,Filme de her√≥i como deve ser!
"Nov 2, 2022",POSITIVE,truly a diamond in the mines of coal
"Nov 2, 2022",POSITIVE,This is the greatest movie comicbook movie of all time.
"Nov 2, 2022",POSITIVE,"Instead of a colourful and unconditionally happy superhuman, we get someone who understands that it is not easy to have these kinds of powers. He is in an internal struggle if and when he should use them.

Awesome action scenes, continuity and believable character development are strenghtend by an incredible cast, well written dialogue and an iconic soundtrack which in my opinion is now a part of Superman just as much as the original John Williams score is."
"Nov 2, 2022",POSITIVE,"Love the action, great Cast - Henry Cavill, Amy Adams.  Watch repeatedly on cable. RT's low rating - don't agree."
"Nov 1, 2022",POSITIVE,"For the first time I see a great movie for a great character like superman.
A movie does respect your mind.. Serous movie not stupid like the prevous superman movies.. This movie made feel the suffering of being superhero it made me think about having superman in a real life.. Great story and very very cool fights and flight scenes, the music is great.. Hans Zimmer made me feel that like I'm watching an epic not a superhero movie and that what we was needing from the movie .. The movie is perfect and it will stay the greatest ever."
"Oct 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"This movie was amazing. This portrayal of Superman was very realistic, showcasing him as a novice hero who makes mistakes against an equally powerful opponent. The music was very well done too."
"Oct 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie, though there are too many long fights. First part is just great for a  superhero origin, I wish I'd see whole movie like it. Actors played amazingly, and music is really awesome."
"Oct 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Absolutamente perfecta, una obra de arte"
"Oct 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"mix of Christopher nolen and Zack Snyder was epic,best super movie yet"
"Oct 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"one of the best soundtracks, will have you pumped right until the end."
"Oct 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"It is a very good film, excellent in all its areas, out of its time, the time it came out was not the right one, a trilogy film that makes up a whole with the following."
"Oct 27, 2022",POSITIVE,First time I watched it was in 2015. It was unexpectedly good with coolest action sequences and the drama. And Hans Zimmer music was a treat notably the First flight
"Oct 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"This is what I call a great origin story of a superhero. I've enjoyed it so much. The action sequences,visual effects, performances everything was so good.Much better movie than these samosa critics reviews"
"Oct 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Entertaining movie, highly recommended"
"Oct 26, 2022",POSITIVE,An iconic movie with a realistic take on Superman! MUST watch!
"Oct 26, 2022",POSITIVE,When I was a child henry cavill was the first and best superman i seen in my life man of steel was a real epic superman movie.waiting for part 2.
"Oct 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Love this movie. The cast, the music, the visuals are all really great. The only thing I'd maybe wish is for the film to take its time a little more. There are great character moments that have to play second fiddle to loud explosive action scenes that in my opinion were one too many. Perhaps if the film took its time a little more we'd have a perfect Superman movie. But I'll settle for this really good one."
"Oct 26, 2022",POSITIVE,Loved it the best superman movie there ever will be
"Oct 26, 2022",POSITIVE,Best story telling of any super hero.
"Apr 5, 2014",POSITIVE,A great new start for the king of superheroes.
"Apr 5, 2014",NEGATIVE,Lots of potential but an awful reboot. Crapy origin story that is over done with action sequences..
"Apr 5, 2014",NEGATIVE,"This ones lost on me. Incredibly boring, visually stunning, can't hold a candle to the donner/reeves films, or even the underrated singer one"
"Apr 5, 2014",POSITIVE,Not completely flawless but a very exciting retelling of Superman's origin and history.
"Apr 4, 2014",POSITIVE,Decent ReStart to the Franchise.
"Apr 4, 2014",POSITIVE,Best movie of 2013! Amazing movie that inspires you!
"Apr 4, 2014",NEGATIVE,OK. Should have been better
"Apr 4, 2014",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel's visual thrills, great performances and stunning soundtrack make it one of the greatest Superman films put to screen, making it a welcome launch pad to the DCEU."
"Apr 3, 2014",NEUTRAL,"I can recommend it, but not as much as Nolan's takes on Batman. I found it to be okay at best.

Full review at filmbroadcaster.weebly.com"
"Apr 3, 2014",NEGATIVE,"It was truly disappointing, it was nothing like the original. Even the trailer wasn't good..
And trailers are supposed to make the movie seem GOOD! Acting was good but perhaps my dislike of Superman himself impairs my judgement of Man of Steel. In which case, the movie was probably good but I just couldn't look past the fact that I'm watching Superman on the Big Screen."
"Apr 2, 2014",POSITIVE,best.superheroe film of the year
"Apr 2, 2014",NEGATIVE,"Superman get the ""Dark Knight"" treatment in Director Zach Snyder's decidedly sci-fi take on the story. Overly long - there's a battle sequence that last almost an hour! - and while that may sound like fun, it becomes tedious and Michael Shannon's villain is rather tiresome. Ultimately underwhelming."
"Apr 2, 2014",POSITIVE,Krypton's superman is the best.
"Apr 2, 2014",POSITIVE,great story and special effects cant fault the movie
"Apr 2, 2014",POSITIVE,Wow...the best superman movie ever
"Mar 31, 2014",POSITIVE,"Brilliant movie! The action scenes were mind blowing, the back story well written, never before have I really connected with Superman, the most iconic hero of all time, but this movie made me root for him! Henry Cavill did a great job!"
"Mar 31, 2014",POSITIVE,The death of Jonathan Kent was not right hadn't been for that it would would've gotten all five stars
"Mar 31, 2014",NEGATIVE,"I never was a superhero fan, and I guess the only one I ever kinda liked was Batman.  But I watched Man of Steel anyways and just like all new hero movies like it I got what I expected, a modern remake letdown. I never was a Superman fan, and this movie did not make me think better of him or his other movies."
"Mar 31, 2014",NEUTRAL,"This movie is good if you like action I would give it a five for action, but I gave it a 3.5 because it keeps going and going on it should have ended 30 min before it did. In the end they ran out of ideas but other than that it was a good movie."
"Mar 31, 2014",POSITIVE,Purist may hate it but the movie stands out as  the best Superman movie in decades.  Very well done.
"Mar 31, 2014",POSITIVE,"A fantastic film with great action, story and characters. It's the perfect start to a possible DC Universe and is portrayed by fantastic acting."
"Mar 31, 2014",NEUTRAL,Man of steel is a slightly disappointing superhero movie with repetitive action and a convoluted script. Some of the things that are positive is the visuals and the epic scale
"Mar 30, 2014",POSITIVE,Superman what a thriller movie!
"Mar 30, 2014",POSITIVE,"Loved it! Amazing story, great acting, left me wanting more"
"Mar 30, 2014",NEGATIVE,"beautiful imagery but hollow... didn't care about anyone. And cliche as fuck, even if it is a little different."
"Mar 30, 2014",POSITIVE,"Excellent relaunch of the superman franchise, top quality actors and fantastic effects. 10/10"
"Mar 29, 2014",NEGATIVE,"Man of Steel has, by far, been the biggest blockbuster letdown of the summer. The worst part is that it really could have been a success. The film's pathetic attempt at depth, like we've seen in Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, were not up to par with the standards we've set for DC. The dialog was atrocious, complete with horrible one-liners and outdates quotes. The storyline was loosely held together by action scene after action scene, leaving you with a sense of discontinuity. Sacrificing action for plot and character development is what ruined Man of Steel. HOWEVER, I will say, I adore Zack Snyder. Watchmen, 300, and Dawn of the Dead are all spectacular films, and Snyder's use of gorgeous cinematography and artistic techniques do not go unnoticed in Man of Steel. Neither does Henry Cavill's true supremeness as Superman, despite the film's lost-in-itself plot. (But really, Henry Cavill is supreme just for existing.)"
"Mar 29, 2014",NEUTRAL,"Visually stunning, packed with visceral action sequences (for better or worse), and finds the most likable Clark Kent in decades in Henry Cavill."
"Mar 29, 2014",POSITIVE,√∞(TM) a must buy movie √∞'
"Mar 29, 2014",NEUTRAL,"Though dark, cheesy, and predictable, I couldn't help but enjoy Man of Steel, and it actually made me like Superman."
"Mar 29, 2014",POSITIVE,"This is the BEST Superman movie!!
I highly recommend this movie!"
"Mar 29, 2014",POSITIVE,"Thsi film allows you to forget totally about the tragic Superman Returns film, it is packed with action and great acting, a lot is going on, some great works in this film."
"Mar 29, 2014",NEGATIVE,"DUH.

It sucked.  




Let me begin my review by saying Man of Steal your money is one of the worst comic book films ever made. 


It is also one of the worst films I have had the chance to lay my eyes on.


So why do I hate this movie so much? Here's why.


First of all, Henry Cavill is shit as Superman. He is bland, over the top, and wooden. As is General Zod. In fact, all the acting in this movie is Razzie worthy, and with Rusell Crowe, acting isn't gonna be great.
The acting is so over the top and wooden the movie is actually hilarious at times. It would work as a comedy, uh?


Apart from the shitty acting, there is NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AT ALL!!!! 

Zack Snyder, thanks!


The special effects in MOS suck dick, and look very out of place in the film.


The plot holes.


And the action. Rather than offering us character development, Zack ""The Hack"" Snyder offers us battles and *sighs* expl**ions. Fuck yeah.
And what pisses me off is that we do not go to watch films for explosions, we go to watch movies for characters. And Zack is such an idiot he won't bother to offer us good stuff and thinks the audience will be entairtained by action. I wasn't.



The battles are so bland, I was bored by every moment of this shitpile.



Final Score for Man of Steal Your Money: 0.5/10
    


I HATE THIS MOVIE!!!! I HATE IT I HATE IT!



ST CNDVHDHGAGSGF


It's pathetically acted, has awful visuals, no character development, mindless, badly paced and awful.


It's the anus of the world."
"Mar 29, 2014",POSITIVE,Great great movie. For a reboot its a really good start
"Mar 29, 2014",NEUTRAL,a perfect comeback to the franchise
"Mar 28, 2014",POSITIVE,best rendition of an old favorite yet
"Mar 28, 2014",NEUTRAL,A promising beginning was spoiled by a second half brimming with Hollywood cliches and action boredom. I enjoyed the origin story of Clark (Kal-el) coming to terms with who and what he is. Kevin Costner is fantastic as the dad that protects him and so is Diane Lane as the mom who nurtures his humanity. But earth is still waiting for the definitive Superman.
"Mar 28, 2014",NEUTRAL,Really enjoyed this film although it was far too long!
"Mar 28, 2014",POSITIVE,"Excellent Adventure + Action + Superhero Movie..................................
Excellent Work.................................."
"Mar 28, 2014",NEGATIVE,"Rip off of Batman Begins
Starring: Moping Cavill"
"Mar 28, 2014",POSITIVE,Epic cinematic experience massive KAL fan and I truely adored the changes made for the new DC movie universe one thing though wheres the Kryptonite
"Mar 27, 2014",NEUTRAL,thought it would be better
"Mar 27, 2014",NEGATIVE,"I shouldn't have to compare Superman to Star Wars (but a crappy knockoff version), but Snyder just gave me a reason to."
"Mar 27, 2014",POSITIVE,"Best Superman movie yet!!! really done well, great cast, perfect choice for Clark Kent...can't wait for the next one!"
"Mar 27, 2014",NEUTRAL,Not bad. But not a Superman movie.
"Mar 27, 2014",POSITIVE,"Liked it better than The Dark Knight Rises. Not saying it's a better movie, I'm simply saying I found the movie more enjoyable than the final installment to the Dark Knight Trilogy of Christopher Nolan."
"Mar 26, 2014",POSITIVE,"With an all-new take on Superman's origin story, a good script full of fantastic dialogue with the story written by Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer and the screenplay written by Goyer, a great cast headed by Henry Cavill as Clark Kent/Superman, Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Michael Shannon as General Zod, Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent, Diane Lane as Martha Kent, Russell Crowe as Jor-El and Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, wonderful directing by Zack Snyder, exciting scenes and sequences and a fast pace and flow, Man of Steel reintroduces the characters we've grown to love for a whole new generation to enjoy again and again."
"Mar 26, 2014",POSITIVE,not really a fan of superman but this is a great action packed movie. Really looking forward to Batman V Superman.
"Mar 26, 2014",NEGATIVE,"Awful movie it's the the worst Superman movie besides Superman 4 it's a stupid stupid movie and it did something a superhero movie can't and hasn't done to me until I saw this bore me it was so boring,yes there is some action in it and I did like the action but it was so boring,the only reasons I'm giving it 3 stars it's because I liked the actors,the cinematography and the action and that's it the story is so boring and that's coming from a comic fan my god."
"Mar 26, 2014",POSITIVE,Finally a Superman film that doesn't consist of weak plot  and cheesy acting. Top notch
"Mar 26, 2014",POSITIVE,"What you want from DC comics, It's dark and has a great twist to the story line. It gives us a Superman we have not yet seen so it allows the plot to go anywhere"
"Mar 26, 2014",NEUTRAL,"Works wonderfully until Superman enters the picture. Afterward, it abandons its thoughtful premise and becomes just another mindless, 45-minute climax of action and high stakes. Entertaining, but oh-so disappointing."
"Mar 26, 2014",POSITIVE,"An almost perfect adaptation, Action and story delivers. Why critics would prefer ""returns"" over this is proof that most critics just like to disagree with hype and audiences opinion for the sake of being ""original"". Rotten tomato seriously needs a new crew!!!!!!"
"Mar 25, 2014",NEGATIVE,"Sure it's packed with brilliant action scenes, but it's one of the most overrated films of 2013. If not ever."
"Mar 25, 2014",POSITIVE,I am very happy to have seen that this superman had a different spin and a lot more action.
"Mar 24, 2014",NEGATIVE,"Man of Steel is everything I DIDN'T want in a Superman. An abominable disappointment. If you've seen the Trailer, there isn't really all that more to look forward to."
"Mar 24, 2014",NEGATIVE,"A triumph of special effects of characters and story.  Some interesting moments, but I was expecting so much more.  http://carstairsconsiders.blogspot.com/2013/06/movie-review-man-of-steel.html"
"Mar 24, 2014",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this movie.  It was heavy with strong action, drama, and a great storyline. I enjoyed
the fact that this movie did not waste
too much time telling us what we
already know about Superman's origin, but it
moves fast past into a great new story
for the current day & age.  I enjoyed the villains too. 
I did not get bored once with this
movie and highly anticipate the next
one in the franchise. I highly recommend
this to superman fans."
"Mar 24, 2014",POSITIVE,Awesome movie and Henry....yum.
"Mar 24, 2014",NEUTRAL,"Es la misma historia una y otra vez, no me canso de verla.
Buena fotograf√≠a, un poco larga."
"Mar 24, 2014",NEUTRAL,"This film would have probably been a flawless film if it didn't have the ""dark"" storyline thing in it. I personally think does not suit Superman as it did with Batman."
"Mar 23, 2014",POSITIVE,"the movie is entire inspiration, providing beautiful pieces of reality and also fantasy. allowing people to realize what they can become if we put our mind into things. music is beautifully done. amazing."
"Mar 23, 2014",POSITIVE,The way they connect THE Smalliville Show and the story is so good and makes you fall in love with him and t the Louis story is such Good movie making and I PERSONALLY love the General Zod character a lot GO Man of Steel/Superman.
"Mar 23, 2014",NEUTRAL,Good but not great. I think the sequel has a chance to be much better.
"Mar 23, 2014",POSITIVE,BRILLIANT FILM ... I'm 32 yes old now and this film takes me right bk to my childhood every time and I could watch it over and over again and again QUALITY √¢¬¢
"Mar 23, 2014",POSITIVE,"I like this movie!  You can't continue to compare to Christopher Reeve. Yes he fit the role, but I think Henry Cavill actually fit it better at least physically.  Don't get me wrong Reeve was certainly great, but his physique wasn't exactly like the comic books , and the special effects are what make Superman Super.  Great movie!"
"Mar 23, 2014",NEGATIVE,"""Man of Steel"" is an awkward piece of garbage that damages the burgeoning integrity of the superhero genre.

-1 Star for inappropriate and random flashback scenes
-1 Star for painful product placement that reminds us why the movie was made
-1 Star for stupid fight scenes
-1 Star for terrible characters, such as a conventional villain and an unconventional Superman that breaks his own rules and arbitrarily puts millions of lives in jeopardy"
"Mar 23, 2014",POSITIVE,Finally a great Superman movie!
"Mar 23, 2014",POSITIVE,"It's a fantastic film and even better than the politically correct Marvel films. Some say it brings a darker approach but in the negative way, In my opinion is the opposite. Man of steel is aimed to bring a darker and more realistic approach which turn to the more mature crowd then the Disney-Marvel crowd. The over destruction of the film brings us to understand that even Superman himself is not a god and needs help (Justice League) especially in Year One.

The disadvantage of the film is that it doesn't bring enough origins to Superman as Clark Kent. The chemistry between Adams and Cavill is lacked not only beacause of the script but also because of the age gap between the two actors."
"Mar 23, 2014",POSITIVE,They did an awesome job updating Superman.  Good movie.
"Mar 22, 2014",POSITIVE,Writing and cinematography were about average but I loved the music!
"Mar 22, 2014",POSITIVE,"the best Superman I've seen in a while. thank you. wasn't sure I would like it, but loved it."
"Mar 22, 2014",NEUTRAL,"This movie has way too much action, but the action is extremely awesome and it does make me believe that Superman is against his greatest threat, yet the story is predictable and quite boring but the action will just blow away the story."
"Mar 22, 2014",POSITIVE,It is an awesome phenomenon.it is truly amazing.
"Mar 22, 2014",NEGATIVE,Messy and boring. Missed opportunity given the competent and clever people involved.
"Mar 22, 2014",POSITIVE,"I finally got to see this movie, and I must say it was very good! (It was good watching it on Blu-Ray too!)"
"Mar 21, 2014",POSITIVE,awesome movie.... LOVE IT
"Mar 21, 2014",NEUTRAL,"Definitely a re-imagining.  However, it was a good one.  Lois Lane's character was a little too different for my taste.  However, Cavill was a perfect fit for Kent.  

The new General Zod character was ridiculously good.  He wasn't just a villain.  He was a villain that had a real purpose centered around his evil actions.  This is the kind of three dimensional villain that many films need to aspire to.

Crowe was good in the Jor'El role.  However, I felt like Jor'El had too much of a presence in this film."
"Mar 21, 2014",POSITIVE,"Okay look, I know a lot of people were very disappointed about this movie. But, I want to give my view of this. I was at the theatre when this came out. I watched it as a fan of comics. The special effects were the best I've ever seen of this movie. This movie was a retelling of an origin of a comic character that has been around forever. Of course, there are going to tell the sad parts of Superman's family past. But, I have seen all five Superman movies except for one with the delete scenes from Superman 2. I have seen and bought the entire Smallville TV series. I have even watched Lois and Clark the TV Series. I have seen almost everything on Superman. But, none of those movies or TV series compares to Man of Steel. This was without question the best Superman movie ever. A few changes that did happen in the movie did take me off guard. But, every Superman movie is considered obsolete when it comes to the special effects of Man of Steel. In my view, it gets four stars. I did like the story. The reason why it is getting four stars is because of the special effects. It drew enough attention to get a sequel. So, I'm more than willing to give the Superman franchise a second chance."
"Mar 21, 2014",NEUTRAL,"Not amazing, but the visual effects are great, though it could benefit a lot from some color saturation."
"Mar 21, 2014",POSITIVE,The Best version of Superman in the last 30 years
"Mar 21, 2014",POSITIVE,Critics are clueless.
"Mar 21, 2014",POSITIVE,Best film I've seen all year.  Take your brain out and go with it.  Also - excellent soundtrack by Hans Zimmer.
"Mar 21, 2014",POSITIVE,"Good, I like the film, there is more story then action and some bits you were waiting for something to happen but it didn't, but overall it was good. I like the end fight scene between Superman and General Zod!"
"Mar 21, 2014",POSITIVE,Amazing in every way
"Mar 21, 2014",POSITIVE,"An exhilarating blockbuster adventure with high flying visual effects and a super size cast, I'm so surprised why this garnered mixed reviews as there's nothing wrong with it to achieve such a middling score. Admittedly it lacks the humour most superhero movies feature but it's over two hours that whip by so fast thanks to a rocketing pace, gripping storytelling, exciting characters with rich backstories and knockout action scenes that last! All the flashbacks are essential to the story and each of them either feature a traumatic childhood event or death. Henry Cavill is a spectacular Superman who carries a sense of earnest to his character, and Amy Adams makes a great Lois Lane, these well known characters are modernised and brought to life by a marvellous cast. Featuring the best city based action climax since Transformers Dark of The Moon, this knockout climax sees New York City fall on it's knees as whole city blocks are demolished, many perish and the visuals are near damn perfect, I guarantee this movie will leave you jaw dropped, pumped and impressed thanks to Zack Snyder's stylish direction and solid writing from David.S Goyer and Christopher Nolan. Would I watch it again? Hell yes, I love this movie, a true superhero movie of our times, and ignore that idiot Diego and his comment that says this is ""the rape of the natural world""."
"Mar 21, 2014",POSITIVE,"Best comic book movie I've ever seen ... Top 10 for me,,, congrats Mr. Snyder I never thought I would say this I'm a fan of superman now"
"Mar 20, 2014",NEGATIVE,I didn't like this movie at all.
"Mar 19, 2014",NEGATIVE,"Man of Steel is an extremely overrated film. Yes, it was better than Superman Returns, but still Man of Steel is an extremely disappointing movie. It deals too much with action rather than plot."
"Mar 19, 2014",POSITIVE,A brilliantly told story with inspired casting.
"Mar 18, 2014",POSITIVE,greater than originally
"Mar 18, 2014",NEGATIVE,Rushed to try to combat avengers.
"Mar 18, 2014",POSITIVE,look at the tittle of the movie.......enough said.
"Mar 18, 2014",POSITIVE,great graphics amazing actors
"Mar 17, 2014",POSITIVE,Great film. Very comic book based and great epic comic book style fighting. Hands down the best Superman made out of the bunch.
"Mar 17, 2014",POSITIVE,"Very great remake. Very interesting choice of villain, but still pulled it off well."
"Mar 17, 2014",NEGATIVE,Man of steel :  I was rather disappointed  in the first part of this movie. Second part is better  with lot of action typical to Superman movies 3/5
"Mar 17, 2014",NEGATIVE,This was a decent movie but I wasn't a fan of the overthetop final fight seen.
"Mar 16, 2014",NEUTRAL,A refreshing jump start to the long-in-the-tooth franchise has a lot going for it. The casting is spot on and the action has a sense of urgency that the originals lack.
"Mar 16, 2014",POSITIVE,"While the plot has more holes than that film with Shia LaBouef in and the screenplay doesn't really feel cohesive, it still benefits from some great set pieces, some thrilling moments and superb cinematography. The cast is star studded (including Cavill's jawline - rivaled only by Judge Dredd's, and Fisburne's moobs - rivaled only by well... nothing) but to be honest none of them are used to great effect because of the unevenness of the film."
"Jan 28, 2014",POSITIVE,Love this film. best superman film so far
"Jan 28, 2014",NEGATIVE,Uggghh should've been great. Had all the tools needed to be great but failed miserably...
"Jan 28, 2014",NEUTRAL,"A grittier, hardened to humans Superman, well judged by Cavill and Adams makes a believable Lois Lane. A genuinely true attempt to bring something different to the characters we already know so well, making them less 2 dimensional. The opening sequences pinched a few ideas in style and content from other movies, but I forgive Snyder for this for casting the brilliant Michael Shannon as General Zod. If you watch this movie with an open mind and don't compare the leads to their predecessors, who we love so much, then you will enjoy it."
"Jan 28, 2014",NEGATIVE,I enjoyed it.  A lot better than I thought.
"Jan 28, 2014",POSITIVE,BEAST MODE!!!! AND THATS FINAL!!!!!
"Jan 28, 2014",POSITIVE,A fresh look at the man of steel from a new perspective..they have taken the patriotic americanism out of this hero and have made him truly an 'alien'. Experiencing fears of acceptance among the human race and on the flip-side of the coin; the human races reaction to life beyond our own planet. Made it all seem that little bit more 'real' than the predecessors. Loved it from start to finish.
"Jan 28, 2014",POSITIVE,Loved it! Good movie awesome soundtrack.  Great day at the theatre had to purchase on blueray which is rare!
"Jan 28, 2014",POSITIVE,"I have read a lot of complaints about The Man of Steel, and most of them are from people expecting the wrong things out of this film.  Zack Snyder said leading up to the film's debut that he wanted to return Superman to his roots as a brawler.  Superman is a physically powerful character, often used in the DC comics as the primary physical defender of the Justice League.  The devastation from the fighting in this film alongside the intensity of the battles is representative of that.  Similar animated attempts at conveying this can be seen in films like Superman vs The Elite.  Aside from the unbelievable action sequences, the acting is top notch.  Among a cast of huge names like Amy Adams, Diane Lane, and Russell Crowe, I actually thought Antje Traue stole the show with her portrayal of Faora."
"Jan 28, 2014",NEGATIVE,Tries too hard to be The Dark Knight.
"Jan 28, 2014",POSITIVE,im going to think outside the box on this one. so how about this? SUPER!!!
"Jan 28, 2014",POSITIVE,Sci - Fi CGI filled epic. Great action and filled to the brim with stunning and immersive visual effects.
"Jan 27, 2014",POSITIVE,"Definately better than Superman Returns, and a feast for the eyes. Perhaps too ""end of the world"" for an origin story, but this film is definately one of my favorite comic book hero films."
"Jan 27, 2014",POSITIVE,Better than I thought it would be!
"Jan 27, 2014",POSITIVE,Awesome!! Cahill did great as Clark Kent..
"Jan 27, 2014",NEGATIVE,"Okay. It's 2013. We GET that you can create large-scale jaw-dropping cinematic visual effects using only a computer. We get it, really. So why are we still continuing to make movies that put visual effects over story and character? The effects in this movie are fantastic, but they are honestly one of the only good things about this film. The trailers strongly implied that we would see a darker, grittier story of Superman, and finally delve into his psyche, which would deliver a refreshing, modern change from the ever-unruffled All-American Mary Sue in the Christopher Reeve franchise. Turns out, all of the best moments that accomplish this were wasted in the trailer, and, as a person, Superman is made only slightly more interesting than before. The supporting cast gets the same treatment, being horrendously under-acted at worst, and inexcusably one-dimensional at best. Several absurdities stick out like sore thumbs throughout the duration of the film (including, but certainly not limited to, really random product placements -- IHOP, really?) and moreover, the story and pacing are confused, cutting back and forth haphazardly from flashback to present with little rhyme or reason. The last 45 minutes of the film is a flurry of fighting and explosions that drags on and on....and on. Despite so much action filling the screen in the film's second half, I found myself extremely bored and wishing for the movie to just END, already. I had a lot of other problems with this movie, but I will not say them here as I do not wish to give anything away. Overall, to me it seemed like someone wrote a script to be a science-fiction film about aliens invading earth to reclaim one of their own species...then someone decided, ""Nah, no one will watch that...I know, let's throw Superman and the gang into this; just change some names, and add a bit about Krypton in the beginning...perfect!"" The majority of this movie is things blowing up or otherwise being destroyed, interspersed with a few brief moments of non-expository dialogue and actual emotion from the characters. Had these moments been built upon more, this film may have been saved, but instead they are discarded to be largely forgotten to make room for more stuff blowing up. This film lacks anything of substance and is nothing but a mess. Man of Steel is a major diSappointment with a capital ""S""."
"Jan 27, 2014",POSITIVE,"Well it was epic in many ways, but missed enough that it wouldn't get 5 stars from me.

Superman's not a dark hero, but that's what he became when Nolan, Goyer and Snyder took over. They made Krpyton look dark and unevolved, unlike the Original which showed them clearly to be an advanced race in mind and spirit, not just technologically. The way they talked, the way matched the landscape of Krypton to the Fortress of Solitude, which was matched to the comics. The way they dressed in white clothing, that never became dirty. This Man of Steel Krypton was dark, dirty and barely anyone showed they had evolved past human kind, except for their technology.

Furthermore, Metropolis was much like Gotham, Superman's costume became darker like Batman's, and there was barely a drop of fun in the movie. That's not the Man of Steel.

Nevertheless, Superman action as we've never seen before, and special effects that the Man of Steel deserved. It was fun, but did not hit the mark for authenticity."
"Jan 27, 2014",POSITIVE,Great job at showing Superman's whole story
"Jan 26, 2014",POSITIVE,Loved the New Superman
"Jan 26, 2014",NEGATIVE,"worst super hero movie to date. 
storyline was completely random. they pulled the villians out of their a$$. the actors were horrible. superman wasnt working for the daily planet, he was a hobo. the effects were way over done. the s logo was changed into some translation instead of ""super""

nothing followed the original story. even the planet of krypton was new. WTF. Krypton was supposed to be green ice or barren. superman was retarded and you will find yourself screaming because he wont use his freaking powers right. the only reason they profited was because it was a superman remake. if youre looking for fireworks, watch this for the 4th of july because this has the shittiest storyline ive ever seen. all there is is effects. >=("
"Jan 26, 2014",NEUTRAL,"Watched with grown son and loved it...was tired of Superman but this was worth the watch...whole new twist, not a super hero story, you'll love it."
"Jan 26, 2014",POSITIVE,Finally a SuperMan movie worth watching.
"Jan 26, 2014",POSITIVE,Better than Superman Returns
"Jan 26, 2014",NEUTRAL,"I bought this, watched it once, and shelved it. cant remember half of it....LOL
I do remember thinking....why amy adams???? she didn't seem to fit the role as far I was concerned. i struggle to take her seriously....i kept waiting for her to burst into song

LOL"
"Jan 26, 2014",NEUTRAL,for a more sifi movie it was good could've been better thou
"Jan 26, 2014",POSITIVE,"A great movie, action-packed, and over all amazing."
"Jan 26, 2014",POSITIVE,"What a great superman film. 5stars, love the beginning"
"Jan 25, 2014",NEGATIVE,"Que mala cinta, metieron demasiadas varas en una sola pel√É¬≠cula y de un momento a otro hacen cambios rar√É¬≠simos como cuando Superman aparece de la nada en la expedici√É¬≥n de la nave de su planeta. 

Las explosiones son mejores en el Chompiras y el Peterete.

Trama demasiado clich√É¬©. 

Cuanto espero el momento en que saquen otra pel√É¬≠cula de s√É¬∫per h√É¬©roes tipo Batman de Nolan."
"Jan 25, 2014",NEUTRAL,I i am a big fan of Christopher Reeves Superman.  I wish I could say the same for this  totaly different version.  Unfortunately I feel this movie missed the mark. Yes it is a new version and it even includes a list of well known actors but the story line just did not hold my attention. There is plenty of in your face action that only Hollywood and computer technology can create but I feel a well written script with an interesting story line would have been nice.
"Jan 25, 2014",POSITIVE,Wow! Really surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. would highly recommend it even if it's not your usual thing.
"Jan 25, 2014",NEGATIVE,"Ugh SO MUCH AWFUL. Like a bunch of execs with conflicting viewpoints all threw their ideas into a hat, mixed them up, ate them, and barfed a movie."
"Jan 25, 2014",POSITIVE,What a superhero film should be. Total devastation and action. Great movie!
"Jan 25, 2014",POSITIVE,"Freaking awesome. Was great experience watching it with my 6yr old son and watching his reactions to the heroics of Superman. His excitement at the end was like reliving being a child enamored with Superman. 
A tad over the top with the demolition and destruction, but still so very good."
"Jan 25, 2014",POSITIVE,"absolutely fantastic film, better than other superman film."
"Jan 24, 2014",NEGATIVE,"I was searching for violence throughout the film to watch the Man of Steel in action, but barely found anything. Mostly sci-fi (read: boring)."
"Jan 24, 2014",NEUTRAL,"Well it was better that the last Superman movie, better casting and a more complete story. But,,,seriously enough with the slamming bodies with video game like movements. Done get me wrong I love video game action, but just not in my movies. It cheapens the experience. But lots of back story on this one and that part is great."
"Jan 24, 2014",NEGATIVE,"I hate to say it, but ""Man of Steel"" sucks. It's a giant production, but instead of doing more with its semi-promising story, it wastes time building smashing and dull, repetitive action scenes are what sadly make up most of the movie."
"Jan 24, 2014",POSITIVE,Awesome movie. The best Superman ever made.
"Jan 24, 2014",POSITIVE,Man Of Steel gives audiences a thrilling sci fi kick with more action than ever seen in a Superman film that allows it to stand tall over the franchise's previous attempt at revival
"Jan 24, 2014",NEUTRAL,"""Transformers"" meets ""Star Trek (2009)"" meets ""Thor.""  With just a sprinkling of the Gospel."
"Jan 24, 2014",POSITIVE,this movie is awesome
"Jan 24, 2014",NEGATIVE,Not on par with past superman movies. The actors did well but thr plot was lacking enough intrigue.
"Jan 24, 2014",POSITIVE,"With its amazing action sequences, well- casted characters, and faithfulness to the comics and Donner films, Man of Steel brings a new take on the classic superhero that is more than welcome."
"Jan 24, 2014",NEGATIVE,fuck sac Snyder its good  but its too long and theirs no humour in it and the acting is not that good.
"Jan 24, 2014",POSITIVE,Top noch superman remake
"Jan 24, 2014",NEGATIVE,"Tries to be deeper than it truly is, and backfires hard. Man of Steel attempts to re-define the iconic character's already well-known backstory, but instead turns into a film constantly trying to remind the viewer of how important Superman is, which gets tiring."
"Jan 24, 2014",POSITIVE,great new take on Superman
"Jan 24, 2014",POSITIVE,This movie was well done. Great fight scenes.
"Jan 23, 2014",POSITIVE,"Great Movie, I saw this in Theatres 13 June 13 and then watched it again at Christmas."
"Jan 23, 2014",POSITIVE,"While it should be noticed this film deserves a 4, not a 5 (i'm a little bias towards DC) Man of Steel was hand's down the best Superhero movie of 2013. It's setting in modern day made sense and it shocked me on well it visual looks and it's captivating storytelling was phenomenal. The fact people hate this movie because ""Superman didn't save everyone is ridiculous and boring. And Zod's fate was justifiable. If you want to see a Superman movie where it's nothing but Boy Scout and same story renewed, watch 80's Superman."
"Jan 23, 2014",NEUTRAL,"liked expanded krypton story. could have done without the same earth origin everyone shows us again & again. big budget fight & flight, needed little extra story though ."
"Jan 23, 2014",NEGATIVE,Not a touch on the batman films.
"Jan 23, 2014",POSITIVE,cracking action movie
"Jan 23, 2014",NEGATIVE,"It was alright, I guess. It's hard to bring any serious emotional pull to a Superman movie, so I can't complain too much."
"Jan 23, 2014",POSITIVE,excellent adaptation and modernization
"Jan 22, 2014",POSITIVE,"First time I saw the movie, I wasn't really impressed, but I think I was expecting the same old Superman story I'd known all my life. BUT the second time I watched it, I knew what to expect & it was so much better! The dad-killing tornado scene was goofy & the last half hour of the movie had so much action that it almost got boring, but otherwise it was really a pretty good movie."
"Jan 22, 2014",POSITIVE,A nice twist on an old an done a few times story line.
"Jan 22, 2014",NEUTRAL,"It had nice special effects, but the story was not that exciting. Probably best for those who don't know anything about Superman."
"Jan 22, 2014",POSITIVE,I thought it was interesting fresh take on Superman and would like to see sequels.
"Jan 22, 2014",NEGATIVE,Terrible movie... 2 hr 30 min movie with less then 30 min of action... Boring storyline that never takes off. And idk who this character is supposed to be but he's not superman...  He's a murderer...  Zack Snyder is the worst excuse for a director I've ever seen.... And his name alone will convince me to never watch another again he is involved in... Thanks for ruining superman ....
"Jan 22, 2014",NEGATIVE,MOS Superman is an imitation not an inspiration.
"Jan 22, 2014",NEUTRAL,"Okay, so I still don't know what to make of this one even months after seeing it, because I certainly didn't hate it as much as a lot of the interwebs seem to have done, but I can't fully support it either, as it just feels like there's not enough going on for me to care about the characters. I loved Michael Shannon chewing scenery, but beyond that, I kinda felt like our new Superman was a bit bland at times.

There's some great visuals, and I rated it somewhat high based on the overall 'slam-bang' action of it all, but I will definitely require a re-watch in a few months' time to see what I truly think of it.

Rental?"
"Jan 22, 2014",NEGATIVE,3D was rubbish movie good but a bit. Boring
"Jan 22, 2014",NEUTRAL,"Love this film great special fx and premise and cast are great not as great as I hoped but, come on zack your a flipping Vfx genius like bay. In my opinion I liked the new take with stand out scenes being moment of his fathers and the chats with lois. The ending is pretty cool but not as good as the small vile fight. Overall it's fun and filled with fast paced action"
"Jan 22, 2014",NEGATIVE,"Clark Kent, Smallville, Krypton, Lex Luthor, Superman. 
These names ring a bell in a certain world of Superman. Once evolved cartoonic series to movies. Now he is the man of steel. 
This new Snyder-Nolan team up came with a totally different perspective and story line of the said Superman series. Say goodbye to Lana Lang as love interest and Lex Luthor as villain. In this movie, we've got the Clark Kent against people from his own planet, Krypton. 

Though the movie was more of a disappointment, I highlighted some of the points I did not miss. 

The story itself was fast-forwarded to answer the question, What becomes of Superman after Luthor and after Jonathan Kent?

Though it highlights several main points about the difficulty of discovering oneself, his love life, his struggles and his earthly-father's desire to keep his ability a secret, this movie has been more of Clark discovering Krypton. 

When we say EPIC-FAIL, I think this was what the movie was all about.
The presence of giant ships, and Jor-el's trench coat allows you to enter ""The Matrix"". Hey Keanu Reeves... 
Where Jor-El's presence is called ""a shadow"" from an ""S""-shaped USB that the people from Krypton use also to maneuver the ship. 
Where the codex is not even an item that they are looking for but the codex it Clark Kent itself. 
Where the letter S is portrayed as a symbol for ""hope"". 
Where Lois Lane was asked by the aliens inside the ship for no reason at all.
Where  Martha Kent survived after being thrown by Zod and Zods men never did anything else than to disappear after he was taken by Superman in the city for more act of violence. 
Where New York was one block away from a farm without any sky-scrappers. 
Where Metropolis came into crumble but Superman never intended to help the people buried underneath the rubble.
Where Zod was programmed to save Krypton even without the existence of Kryptonians.
Where Lois Lane is an award winning Pulitzer journalist and I don't even have a clue why was that mentioned.
Where moral-issue was highlighted but was unable to save his earthly father, standing helpless in front of a tornado. 
Where ""you're not my real dad"" script comes out of the context.
Where Metropolis watch many people die when the man of steel was in nowhere but comes back in time to rescue Lois Lane.
Where after snapping Zod's neck, Lois Lane appears for some reason. 
Where contrary to the Superman everyone knows of, this man of steel does not care about the people's safety and welfare. 
Where his weakness is not on Kryptonite but on killing (moral issue). 

Though the movie was a THUMBS-DOWN on my viewpoint, I still highlighted some quotes from the movie that struck me.
Just because you can't control me doesn't mean I'm your enemy.
Faith comes first, trust will follow.
You are my son. But somewhere out there you have another father, and he sent you here for a reason. And even if it takes you the rest of your life, you owe it to yourself to find out what that reason is.
What if child dream of becoming something other than what society intended? What if a child aspire to something greater.
Superman was once portrayed as a person from Krypton to save the people. In this movie, he was there to protect people. To save and protect are two different frames which were not highlighted in the movie. Maybe it was but it sucks.

The only part I love was how the two fathers, provided love, care and assistance to Clark."
"Jan 22, 2014",POSITIVE,"Yes, sometimes there is a bit much happening in the fight scenes, and the action is a little rich - but this is what we all complained about not seeing enough of. 

For those who punch holes in plot, save yourselves some time - accept you're watching movie about aliens who fly. 

This is a good action superhero flick, which gives you a sense of how much 'more' powerful supes really is. It's supported by a beautiful soundtrack and brilliant percussion."
"Jan 22, 2014",POSITIVE,better than the original by far can't wait for a squeal
"Jan 22, 2014",POSITIVE,"Love it, it has action and a 
great  audio!!!"
"Jan 21, 2014",POSITIVE,Fantastic Film! Everything I wanted from a Superman movie! The fight scenes were epic! The Critics are wrong on this one!
"Jan 21, 2014",POSITIVE,Fantastic Film! Everything I wanted from a Superman movie! The fight scenes were epic! The Critics are wrong on this one!
"Jan 21, 2014",NEUTRAL,"a sleeper movie, great cast, really liked it..."
"Jan 21, 2014",NEGATIVE,The action is great but the plot sucks.
"Jan 21, 2014",POSITIVE,"Really cool, fun action film. Don't forget to bring popcorn"
"Jan 21, 2014",POSITIVE,Probably the best Superman movie made. Can't wait until the next.
"Jan 21, 2014",POSITIVE,Superman addict so I'm bias but loved it
"Jan 21, 2014",POSITIVE,"Good film, action packed with great special effects"
"Jan 21, 2014",POSITIVE,"Didn't think this was going to be good but I was wrong, really well thought out and good story line"
"Jan 21, 2014",POSITIVE,"This was as good as superman the movie. It has great f/x. A great story line and shows a lot of compassion, which I love. I'm glad I bought the movie."
"Jan 21, 2014",POSITIVE,"Great movie. It's different from the original, which is refreshing and done well. Highly recommended."
"Jan 20, 2014",POSITIVE,great movie its a like it or don't movie.good update for today
"Jan 20, 2014",NEUTRAL,Ok movie.not a must see for me
"Jan 20, 2014",NEGATIVE,"Man of Steel is a movie that tries hard to be like other movies in the genre and a Summer spectacle, but sadly fails in both areas. The movie is plagued with lots of small problems that gather up into a huge one, annoying product placement, a story line that keeps switching time period, several stupid moments, and the biggest of all, attempting to be like Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, but instead is just dull and dreary. Overall this is a movie that thinks it's more epic and smart then it actually is, and instead is just gloomy and pretentious. With that said, it's not entirely bad, it's just really average, and sometimes that's even more disappointing. Instead watch Richard Donner's Superman films or the classic animated shorts, which are much better and despite some faults, will provide better entertainment for the Superman fan."
"Jan 20, 2014",POSITIVE,MAN OF STEEL is the Only Super Heroe !!!!
"Jan 20, 2014",POSITIVE,"THIS is Superman. I thought the interesting take on Krypton was very creative. The story of Clark learning about his abilities and his purpose for being on this planet was more grounded. This movie also threw away quite a bit of the cheesy humor and atmosphere that usually accompanies Superman. Whether that is a positive or negative thing is up to the viewer. (I personally like it better the way Man of Steel did it.)
While there were many complaints about the ""excessive destruction"" caused by Kryptonians fighting each other on Earth, I found the crumbling buildings to be essential. A battle between beings whose punches can emit enough force and sound to shatter nearby windows would, of course, be rather destructive.
I found this modern take on Superman to be a successful one, and I cannot wait to see what's next for the Man of Steel (or the dark and cunning Dark Knight.)"
"Jan 20, 2014",POSITIVE,cant wait for the next installment
"Jan 20, 2014",NEGATIVE,"Could have been better, maybe I expected more?"
"Jan 20, 2014",NEGATIVE,It had to much action for my taste. Superman broke threw too much buildings and then had the worst ending!
"Jan 20, 2014",POSITIVE,not a big film lover but this film had me gripped from the first minute to the last! Would definitely reccommend this to anyone.
"Jan 20, 2014",POSITIVE,Great movie. Every guy's boyhood hero.
"Jan 20, 2014",NEUTRAL,"The only reason this movie is considered rotten is because the characters have no identities for the most part, but other than that I still think the action scenes are great, the acting holds up, and all in all I am still glad I saw it. If they're going to go all out with a Batman and Superman movie, it definitely has to be a lot more character driven than this movie."
"Jan 19, 2014",NEGATIVE,"Not gonna lie, I'd never seen a superman film before this. I fell asleep in the cinema only to be rudely awoken by the ridiculous action scenes..."
"Jan 19, 2014",NEGATIVE,"PLZ Hollywood, please... just stop remaking Superman. Well, I guess its ok... if your idea of Superman is one where, there is hardly any establishment of character, least of all a farmboy one who nary would destroy an entire city to fight with Zod. Have they even read the comics? :blinkblink: The guy who played him was cute, but I still dont think he properly replaces Christopher Reeves. I wish hollywood would stop trying to replace him.... those movies are the best ones ;/"
"Jan 19, 2014",POSITIVE,Good movie slightly overdone though and superman does not kill people.
"Jan 19, 2014",POSITIVE,amazing story line....cant wait for next one:-)
"Jan 19, 2014",POSITIVE,"this movie was phenomenal even though the Christopher Reeve movies are legendary, this gives a fresh new start to a superman movie"
"Jan 19, 2014",POSITIVE,This is the best movie ever
"Jan 19, 2014",POSITIVE,"Lots of fun, worth watching, so much bad criticism but you cant please everyone all the time. Looking back at the superman movies I loved 25 years ago when I was a kid, they actually seem a bit cheezy in the acting department."
"Jan 19, 2014",POSITIVE,Went in with low expectations but I ended up really liking this movie a ton!
"Jan 19, 2014",POSITIVE,A lot of movie buffs and Marvel nerds seem to overthink this one. I'm a normal bloke... Man of Steel was bloody epic.
"Jan 19, 2014",NEUTRAL,This is pretty much just an average remake of Superman 2.
"Jan 19, 2014",POSITIVE,The best superman so far
"Dec 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,Great  action but half of it is hard to see with the cameraman having a seizure!
"Dec 30, 2013",POSITIVE,Best superman movie to date
"Dec 30, 2013",POSITIVE,"'Man of Steel' demands repeated reviewing, by no means is it a heavy film, you just appreciate it more when watched several times. The special effects are spectacular, a bit overboard when it comes to the action pieces such as the scene involving a mid-air bar-fight  between the super hero and general zod. The dialogue has its moments but overall its decent. It feels a lot like the new reboot of Spiderman, its a pretty good movie just not spectacular in the sense like The Dark Knight Series."
"Dec 30, 2013",POSITIVE,Best superman film in a decade
"Dec 30, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie and great effects
"Dec 30, 2013",POSITIVE,Top film this is how Superman should be!!!!
"Dec 30, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is probably one of the few action hero films that delivers in terms of getting straight into the action and story, without the need for elongated sub plots and building into a mindless rush of action at the end. man of steel keeps you fed and watered with action from the very beginning to the very end and in terms of love story films such as the spider man trio and all the iron man films, then there are the hulk movies as well, which seem to drown themselves in the lovey dovey  mush that just tires movie watchers out when all they want to do is be entertained.. yes you want to be concerned about the characters but not distracted by there need to procreate. zack snyder reigns all  the mush in and adds just the right amount of humour but even better gives man of steel a dark and even spiteful side as seen in the roadside diner scene where one of the drunken big rig driver gives cavill, (working as a barman) a hard time by pouring beer over him, the"" turn the other cheek"" hero walks away and you think its the end of the matter only to later follow the drunken lorry driver outside only to find the man of steel has impaled the twisted wreck with some telegraph poles.. very spiteful but very amusing at the same time... all the cast pull there weight too. in all a very entertaining movie."
"Dec 30, 2013",POSITIVE,Excellent movie. Good new version of a great story.
"Dec 30, 2013",POSITIVE,"Quite simply, awesome."
"Dec 30, 2013",NEGATIVE,"55% is too much for this yawn fest. Seriously, how many failed Superman movies are going to get made. By one hour into the film I was comparing how riveted I was at the same point in the Avengers vs. checking my watch during this dull excuse for CGI. A sequel? Really?"
"Dec 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,A true superman for the modern age
"Dec 30, 2013",POSITIVE,Excellent plot with proper homage paid to the character portrayed in the comic books
"Dec 30, 2013",POSITIVE,I like that they just did flashbacks and not starting from the beginning....again when he was a teenager.
"Dec 30, 2013",POSITIVE,OK Now So Here is my review on this movie I just got it for Christmas from my uncles because we saw it over the summer and it is my favorite movie ever and when I watched it the second time I was shocked on how good it was I cannot wait until Man Of Steel 2 with Superman and Batman in it although I am not looking forward to Ben Affleck playing Batman. Christian Bale will not only be the best  Batman but one of the best actors. I thought Henry Cavill did such a GREAT job in this film but if it came down on who did the best I would say defiantly Amy Adams who played Louis Lane what a great person to play her she did incredible. This was a great film and way more stars then five.
"Dec 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,Its OK a few too many special effects
"Dec 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Interessante (e eficiente) ao apresentar uma nova perspectiva do her√≥i, enfocando sua identidade alien√≠gena e o subsequente isolamento entre o povo ""terr√°queo"". Contudo, peca por alguns momentos artificiais e pelo eventual tom piegas, sendo que nem todos os flashbacks s√£o bem articulados. A c√¢mera tr√™mula √© irritante, mas at√© justific√°vel em parte significativa do longa..Boas atua√ß√µes, excelentes sequ√™ncias de a√ß√£o e √≥tima trilha sonora."
"Dec 30, 2013",POSITIVE,The Best Reboot of superman ever
"Dec 30, 2013",POSITIVE,good film effects are cool good acting
"Dec 30, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie was a mind blowing version of Superman. And Henry Cavill really lived up to the expectations of being Superman!!
"Dec 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I thought it was OK. The fight scenes were great , but like all of the new DC movies there was just too much oh so serious bullshit!!!"
"Dec 30, 2013",POSITIVE,best superhero movie ever
"Dec 30, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Gritty reboot = yawn.
Henry Cavill > Brandon Routh

Despite boasting the best product placement since Garfield, this movie will forever show how DC is always a few steps behind Marvel in terms of films."
"Dec 30, 2013",POSITIVE,love henry caville as superman - best yet!
"Dec 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,I am no superman fan but I enjoyed this movie.
"Dec 30, 2013",POSITIVE,"fantastic, film of the year!"
"Dec 30, 2013",POSITIVE,"I was not really looking forward to this movie, being a huge fan of the original films charm and humour, and theme tune! But I cannot deny that I have enjoyed this new adaptation thoroughly and hope a sequel is to follow. The effects are stunning as you would expect, but I also enjoyed the warmth of the main characters, which having read other reviews before watching was a pleasant surprise! Give it a chance, you just might like it :-)"
"Dec 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The newest Superman film, despite it's spectacular visual effects and intriguing back-story of the life of Clark Kent (or Kal-El to those who prefer that name), it has such an overdose of alien themes I nearly forgot that he was a super-hero! This movie is more like another ""Iron Giant"" with dense (and long) plot development, not enough action, and the sense that there aren't enough answers by the end to leave you satisfied. It may charm the ladies with it's interesting and long story, but will leave men begging for some hero vs. villain action that makes Superman films iconic."
"Dec 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,One of the best superman movies yet it's just I never caught on to it to follow even though I am a comic reader myself and know the story
"Dec 29, 2013",POSITIVE,Better than I thought.
"Dec 29, 2013",POSITIVE,The movie was SUPER!! Some have criticized the film for being dark  which is the very thing that I found appealing about it. This is a Superman that is desperate to find his identity and what he is meant to do. The other superman movies skipped the identify issues and went straight to a Man  of Steel who was already in control and had figured things out. I enjoyed seeing stumble and make mistakes because it is those mistakes that will helps him realized how careful he needs to be in order to preserve life and thus find alternative ways to deal with a situation without resulting to someone's demise.  I am confident that in the next film you will get the upbeat Superman we all know and love.
"Dec 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"I just finished watching Superman Man of Steel its an Awezome Movie!!! The fight scenes in the movie are astonishing, by far the best movie of the year. I will give it 5 stars!!!"
"Dec 29, 2013",POSITIVE,Better than the previous 21th century attempts on a Superman movie. It's worth a watch for both comc fans and the average joes.
"Dec 29, 2013",POSITIVE,best surperman ever!!!
"Dec 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It looked cool, and was fun, but I expected so much more from this crew!"
"Dec 29, 2013",POSITIVE,great movie. great graphics. didn't like all the jumping aroud or the fact that he killed zod.
"Dec 29, 2013",POSITIVE,Unlike the other naysayers....I enjoyed this movie quite well. Action was great! loved the story line. I always know I will love a movie if the critics hate it.  I like the fact that it shows his frustration with his odd jobs before he has to decide to make himself know. Love the fact that Lois knows who he is and doesn't have to erase her memory every time.
"Dec 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,Not the best superhero movie of the year.
"Dec 29, 2013",POSITIVE,Love a great superhero movie
"Dec 29, 2013",POSITIVE,best superman movie yet!
"Dec 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,I know a lot of people didn't like it but I enjoyed it. It was better then all of the other supermans with Reeves (except is I and II).
"Dec 29, 2013",POSITIVE,Superman lives again in all his glory and more!
"Dec 29, 2013",POSITIVE,best ever loved it great movie
"Dec 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Do you like the Nolan Batman films? Do you like rip-offs of the Nolan Batman films, with little to no humanity, analysis, character development, or joy? Do you like movies with 3/4 violence, special effects and endless product placement? Then does the once original Zach Snyder have the thing for you! This movie was tired, depressing, and just not a Superman movie. Now I understand the character of Clark Kent can be changed, and I understand you need to show vulnerability while creating any character, but you don't go into a summer blockbuster to see Henry Cavill whine for two and a half hours. If they made the dialogue interesting and the villain more colorful, like in the Dark Knight movies, my all-time favorite trilogy, it would have been good, even if it was a complete rehash of DC's last successful film. Marvel movies are soaking up all the popularity, and DC's only popular franchise is now over, and that may because Marvel movies know what audiences want. They may not be as good as the Dark Knight films, but they can keep you through an hour an a half without falling asleep in between the overabundance of flying fight scenes. I did really like the scenes on Krypton though. And the resolution, though controversial, I thought, was smart and well thought out. Everything else was kind of lame."
"Dec 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"Good film, entertaining, lots going n, very few dull patches. I hope this leads to a decent franchise like Batman movies."
"Dec 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,Only thing that kept me awake was Henry Cavill's good looks.
"Dec 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"The Cinematography in this film to say the least, amazing.  I think they did well to remake the story with today's technology simply because the memory of the old one is now dated.  It will never be for those of us who remember Reeves performance and smile, that superman, but in a world that is getting a heavier, more serious tone, this Superman fits this time.  Great work, and can't wait for a sequel."
"Dec 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Fight scenes were pretty awesome. However, it's just another superman movie with Zodd. Give us a superman villain other than Zodd or Lex Luthor."
"Dec 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,Drags out a little. To much Sci fi.  Still a lot better than superman begins
"Dec 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"Loved it!  I like that they separated themselves from the Christopher Reeves movies.  They updated the story and the action is fantastic.  Some complained that Superman doesn't kill, but in the comics, Superman DOES kill Zod to save people, so it is not out of character.  The epic destruction is shocking, but overall it was a risk worth taking."
"Dec 29, 2013",POSITIVE,More than worth the wait =D x
"Dec 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,I think if Brandon Routh had been given this Script and this movie to act in Everyone would believe he WAS / Is a very good Superman
"Dec 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Delivering promise in his previous films, Zach Snyder seemed to be the perfect choice to reboot the Superman icon, but this all boils down to a over-bloated, badly-acted superhero movie that never puts the ""super"" in the ""hero."""
"Dec 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"What the hell... the dialogue sucks and the action can go for too long; But it's everything I wanted out of a Superman movie and makes me look forward to what else they can do with this character. Makes me sad that most people feel aggressive about it, especially with a character with dozens of interpretations."
"Dec 29, 2013",POSITIVE,Loved every minute of this film. Russell Crow is excellent in this film.
"Dec 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"great film,  brilliant story and the effects are incredibly good."
"Dec 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"I went in not expecting much and was pleasantly surprised.  They have given new life to the Superman movies, which were beyond dwindling.  I can't wait for the Justice League movies if this is a sign of things to come."
"Dec 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel is so far, my favourite Superman movie not only is it stunningly visual with epic battles and flying sequences but the acting is brilliant and the story to it is told just so perfectly. Man of Steel is  THE CORRECT WAY how Superman should be done! I will admit however at the start when first watched it I was a bit confused but after watching it a second time it made so much sense. 5 stars for me."
"Dec 29, 2013",POSITIVE,Cant wait for the sequel with the dark knight on it.What a brill new plot and story of Zack
"Dec 29, 2013",POSITIVE,Da new Man of  Steel is a must C for all SuperMan fans waiting on another part!!!!
"Dec 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,Another version of superman movie
"Dec 29, 2013",POSITIVE,Absolutely epic! The Superman movie we've been waiting for- Brilliant!
"Dec 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,A very good film with fantastic special effects.. but I'm sticking superman the movie you can't best the first one.
"Dec 29, 2013",POSITIVE,excellent relly good :-)
"Dec 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Not the same Superman I remember. Good movie, but not an improvement to the story."
"Dec 28, 2013",NEGATIVE,Fell asleep. Superman ended up being g someone I didn't really like or care for.  No spark.  No life. Blah.
"Dec 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,"[Man of Steel] has to much violence, but everything else seems to be somewhat fine."
"Dec 28, 2013",POSITIVE,"The movie is great. It makes you realize how much science fiction focused Superman is with the beginning of the film on Krypton. I usually don't care for Superman, but this movie made me like him! The action scenes were flashy and endless but how is that bad? It is this epic battle between Superman and Zod that threatens all of Earth. It was great. There isn't a lot of humor or light heartedness in the movie because it is darker interpretation of Superman. It is one of the best comic book super hero movies ever."
"Dec 28, 2013",POSITIVE,A really fun movie and entertaining!
"Dec 28, 2013",POSITIVE,"Best movie, best actors. Btw Lois Lane is pretty hot"
"Dec 28, 2013",POSITIVE,I loved this take on superman! cant wait for number two!
"Dec 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Man of Steel is high on action and destruction, but it's sadly low on character development. Thankfully, the action is riveting making it entertaining enough (still didn't even get close to reaching expectations)."
"Dec 28, 2013",POSITIVE,A great start to an interesting new take on Superman. Let's hope the follow-ups properly expand on this.
"Dec 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A much, much better reboot than the 2006 version. Great cast, although Adams as Lois Lane is a stretch, great story. A bit disappointed they tried to Dark Knight-ify Superman. Think a bit more humour and a little less focus on taking Superman down the gritty road every reboot seems to go down might have been better. The Avengers is the perfect example. Man of Steel starts well and steams along very nicely but kind of gets bogged down in special effects in the last 30 minutes. This version does much better job of portraying Superman's struggle with trying to fit in and hiding his powers. Bottom line, much better reboot than the Brandon Routh version. Top marks for the Christopher Reeve CGI cameo."
"Dec 28, 2013",POSITIVE,Larry and I both enjoyed this film. It has a lot of amazing special effects and graphics. the storyline has been seen before but the only thing I did not enjoy was the constant going back and forth between being a man and his childhood. I understand in some parts it was needed but the film makers should had gone through time of his life in order. It would had made it into more of a realistic SUPERMAN for us.
"Dec 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,"First hour of the movie was a bit choppy, but then we begin to see some classic Superman and spectacular special effects and fabulous violence. Last hour was very enjoyable!"
"Dec 28, 2013",POSITIVE,"Finally, a Superman film we can be proud of."
"Dec 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Better than any other Superman movies...and yet, it was just another epic blockbuster. There were definitely some great moments (the first 15 minutes, the flashbacks were also incredible), but the fighting seemed to go on and on. Overall, an OK movie."
"Dec 28, 2013",POSITIVE,"Loved it! Don't mind the original story of the being told again, this time with more detail and a different twist. Russell Crowe did a good job but didn't look the part, someone who resembles Superman would be better since it was supposed to be a natural childbirth. I can't help but wonder how many civilians were killed in the final battle with entire buildings toppling etc. Then the next day when we see Clark Kent at the Daily Planet, it was like business as usual as if nothing had happened."
"Dec 28, 2013",NEGATIVE,"LONGGGGGGG , goes nowhere slowly"
"Dec 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,Cavill & Crowe saves this...the Krypton scenes are inspirational
"Dec 28, 2013",POSITIVE,Really good film. Not 5 stars but a solid 4 stars.
"Dec 28, 2013",POSITIVE,Man Of Steel...movie of steal
"Dec 28, 2013",POSITIVE,"Good movie. Weird, for me, to watch a superman that isn't Christopher Reeve though."
"Dec 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,"good movie, just does not follow the comic"
"Dec 28, 2013",POSITIVE,Loved the film carn't wait till they bring the next one out
"Dec 28, 2013",POSITIVE,Simple you either like it or you don't!!
"Dec 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Think about it: if Zod had just colonized Mars, he could have saved his entire species."
"Dec 28, 2013",POSITIVE,"I think we all know the superman story, I liked the direction that  they took the film this time around."
"Dec 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It's hard to not pass judgment on a film without comparing it to its predecessors if the source material is well known. Unfairly or not, a critique of ""Man of Steel"" has to be helped or sullied by the muscle memory invoked by versions past.  And with some past versions of ""Superman"" being quite good, it puts ""Steel"" in the precarious position of having some pretty big shoes to fill.

The film just struggles. You can feel the film struggling.  Even with the things it does right, ""Steel"" labors to be interesting and in many ways creates a mess for itself. 

Let's start with what it has rewritten. It has given Lois Lane (the miscast Amy Adams) and Jor-El (Russell Crowe) ""more"" to do and with that it effectively gives Superman/Clark (a stiff but physically perfect Henry Cavill) a lot less to do making him not as compelling in the story as he should be.  And despite Lois' increased role, she's pretty inconsequential. 

And those are just the few character shortcomings in the film.  There are many others you can quibble with but the films biggest problem?  It's boring. As nonsensical as it seems that a film with such extraordinary subject matter is so boring, it inexplicably is. Even the scenes with awesome effects like the great fight sequence between Superman and his two Kryptonian opponents is hampered by the corniest exposition dialogue.  But the action sequences save the film from being a disaster. 

Too bad Zach Snyder directed this film as his penchant for flashy visual effects without any substance hurts the film.  He seems to not understand how to effectively use his camera to best showcase humanity.  What he fails to understand with this and his other films is that it is not just an actors job to invoke substance, he needs to pace films to let humanity show appropriately.  He needs to stage scenes to showcase these moments. He's too consumed by dazzling the eye and ear that he forgets about dazzling the brain."
"Dec 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Si algo hizo tan exitosa la saga de Batman fue que la gente la sinti√≥ real. Obviamente Superman es otro tipo de s√∫per h√©roe (extraterrestre), pero de todas formas el film se siento muy exagerado y poco real en las partes que pod√≠a serlo. Los efectos especiales son notables, pero es una pel√≠cula que deja mucho que desear."
"Dec 28, 2013",POSITIVE,I was Lois lane in another life :)
"Dec 28, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman film since the first Christopher Reeve one. Bring on the sequel
"Dec 28, 2013",POSITIVE,finally a good superman movie
"Dec 28, 2013",POSITIVE,A great start point for anyone not familiar with the past superman movies. DO NOT Judge this against the old superman films and take it for the modern day Superman and hopefully you'll love the film as much as I did! 5 stars.
"Dec 28, 2013",POSITIVE,i got it on dvd it is awesome
"Dec 28, 2013",NEGATIVE,One of the worst films of the year. Hope it wins a few Razzies. (Razzies are the worst movie awards)
"Dec 28, 2013",POSITIVE,"As with any film, it comes down to personal preference, but for me I really enjoyed this 'reboot' of the superman legacy. If anyone has seen the animated series, then they might recognise many elements that made up the first parts of the last son of krypton. As such we see more of krypton itself, and although it destruction might vary from other versions, it is still the principle reason for sending there son away. Although general zod  is the bad guy for this film rather than lex Luther, it makes for more dramatic stand off as where only in cartoons did the fight and wreck things in large scale, this live action I feel portrays better what super powered beings would like like and at. And the human populous certainly gets injured or worse in between."
"Dec 28, 2013",POSITIVE,"Watched my ""Man of Steel"" Blu-ray and now can stream it from flixster, got to love it."
"Dec 28, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I literally fell asleep while watching this movie. This was a huge disaster and I am devastated, as a Superman fan, to see this defile the fantastic comics."
"Dec 28, 2013",POSITIVE,Best movie ever made :)
"Dec 24, 2013",POSITIVE,Real good story line
"Dec 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"Awesome, by far the best Superman yet and perfect actor for the role.  Superman needed to become more in line with reality and I wouldn't call it dark (like Batman) but realistic justice.  In war, killing is a part of it and to think you can't kill when the time arises is just naivety.  Batman is NOT a superhero, he is just a man with great tools.  Superman is a true superhero.  Great job!"
"Dec 24, 2013",POSITIVE,Great effects and soundtrack.
"Dec 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,Much better than the return with Brandon Routh.
"Dec 24, 2013",POSITIVE,good adaptation of the greatest ever super hero ever
"Dec 24, 2013",POSITIVE,It's a great movie I watched it in the cinemas
"Dec 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"We have seen the story quite a few times, with the old run Superman series, the reboot and even with Smallville, but TO BE HONEST this is the story arc I liked the most. Not to confuse or let down the classic Superman with Christopher Reeve, but this one got me close to a superhero that doesn't appeal me much as Batman or the rest of the Marvel universe. I'm eager to see the Justice League with todays filmaking powers."
"Dec 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The special effects maybe far superior to the 1978 and 1981 Superman films, however the film itself is but a weak amalgamation of both. In my opinion the film lacks thrills, humour and excitement.  As a young boy when I first saw Christopher Reeves change into Superman in the revolving doors to save Lois Lane from the helicopter accident my heart started pounding and still does everytime I see that scene. Unfortunately this film does not deliver the same excitement from beginning to the end."
"Dec 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"I thought they did a great job of making a ""real world"" superman.  So many people complain that he kills Zod, but in a ""real life"" scenario, there was no way to cage a Kryptonian on Earth and Zod was not going to reform and start preaching peace.  I thought it was great!"
"Dec 24, 2013",POSITIVE,Loved it!!! Action packed and full of great CGI
"Dec 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"For all the derogatory reviews and talk I heard about this movie, I expected it to be a train wreck.  It's not, though.  I enjoyed watching the movie.  While it's not the typical embodiment of a Superman story, it looks great, entertains, and has a cohesive story."
"Dec 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"An excellent cast give depth and meaning to a story embedded in the American psyche as a Norman Rockwell style tale. It was about time to update the story and give a more of a reasonable account of Superman's origin, without all the outdated sentimentality of the 50's  and 70's. Very well done!"
"Dec 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel is most likely the greatest interpretation of Superman. It doesn't just apply incredibly realistic, awe-striking visual effects and scientific reason (like how Kal-El can jump far distances because of Earth's weaker gravity relative to Krypton), but also for the first time on the big screen gives Superman philosophy. Superman is THE Superhero in all of pop culture because he has weird alien qualities that make him learn about himself as a hero and his reason to exist with those odd qualities. His most story-arc fitting antagonist Zod tries to continue the kryptonian race by using destructive force on Earth to make it inhabitable by clones whom never question and behave like mindless and lifeless ants. Kal-El (Superman) as the protagonist fights this force by accepting his freakish nature and by being a person that doesn't downgrade himself to whatever society tells him to do. In addition to that, he also pushes his most predominant talents to the limits.

The moral of this film as expressed by Superman might be the greatest if not one of the greatest morals a human organism could conceive:

By being yourself and by pushing your most predominant qualities, you are not just a unique man, you are a Superman.

Zack Snyder: You have done Superman justice!

As someone with Aspergers syndrome, I always think to myself how much of a loner I am with my intellect and artistic creativity. I am grateful for those qualities and this Superman story gave me hope to push myself to achieve wonders.

Superman is one of my greatest icons!

Watch this film if you are human (aka not ""perfect"")!"
"Dec 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"The greatest comic book film of all-time, Henry Cavill soars!"
"Dec 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"The best fuckin movie I've ever seen, full of hardcore action and if u don't like this movie u're gay !!"
"Dec 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,......What a bore......Thank God for my fast forward.....The Lois Lane character was singularly unattractive.......Didn't bother to look up who she was.......
"Dec 24, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie introduction and the effects were amazing
"Dec 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,Very disappointing probably the worst film I saw this year.
"Dec 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"Just got it from asda on blu-ray 3D 
looks a good film. :)"
"Dec 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great family movie, leave Mom @ home however lol"
"Dec 24, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome re-boot of Superman!!!
"Dec 24, 2013",POSITIVE,Better than expected
"Dec 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,"What an absolute Turkey! I love Amy Adams and Henry Cavill was fine, but what a complete waste of two and a half hours. This guy should never direct again."
"Dec 24, 2013",POSITIVE,Man of steel is the best Superman movie I ever saw.
"Dec 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"Yes it's yet another reboot, but who cares!? Man of Steel delivers on the things it should grounding a movie spectacle in some heart felt (albeit sometimes clunky) human emotion. Anyone asking if we really needed to see the origin story again should ask themselves, how many kids of our generation are really that interested in the original Superman (RIP Mr Reeve).

If you can cast aside your expectations grounded in the 70s and 80s then you will enjoy a film that offers plenty of thrills without the OTT crassness of the Transformers trilogy.

While DC would do well to noted the underlying humour that Marvel has managed to inject into its franchises, Man of Steel is a worthy effort for a movie stuck between a rock and a very hard place when viewed by critics and fans alike."
"Dec 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"Not nearly as interesting as the batman movies, but still super fun to watch. Seriousness seems to be a common theme between the D.C. movies with this one almost going over the top. Besides all of the doom and gloom with little comic relief, its really hard to not like this movie. If the future movies are on par with this one It could be another great super hero series!"
"Dec 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"At first, I really didn't want to see this movie. Not just because it looked like a rip off of Batman Begins. but also because I am not really a fan of the Superman character in general. Whenever I think of a stereotypical and 1 dimensional superhero either Aqua man or Superman. However, I became curious when there seemed to be a huge split among Critics and Audience alike. People either really love or really hate this movie. So. I decided to expand my horizons and check out one of the biggest blockbusters of 2013. 

Kal El (Henry Cavill)  comes from the planet Krypton. He has been sent to Earth after his planet is destroyed and taken in by the Kents. After living a life of rejection and ostracism, Kal El becomes Superman and must defend Earth from General Zod (Michael Shannon). Though the film has a lot of flaws, it does excel in talented acting and stunning visuals. Really, every person tries their hardest in roles that are really either flat or just one noted. Take Amy Adams as Lois Lane for example. Yeah, this character is pretty pointless, she really is just the wise cracking Reporter who always needs to get rescued. Still though, Adams does a really good job holding her own against a character who probably should've stayed in the confines of the comics. Even Razzie favorite Kevin Costner holds up okay. Then again, he doesn't have a lot to do anyway in the film. 

Like I said, the visuals are really interesting to look at. It doesn't matter if we're talking about the planet of Krypton, the Fortress of Solitude or the final battle between Superman and Zod. However, the great visuals is both an advantage and a disadvantage to Man of Steel. During the great fight scenes and explosions, we don't get much narratively about the character of Kal El. We are not getting the story of a great Superhero, we are getting the legend of a great superhero. Throughout the entire movie, we are always seeing the great and heroic things that Superman does. However, it's never explained, we are supposed to just go with it because he's Superman. To put it simply we don't get to see or know who Kal El is. We only know what he's supposed to be and what he's supposed to stand for. This really isn't enough (at least for me) to be really invested in this character because I want to know who the person behind that symbol is. 

Michael Shannon as General Zod is fantastic casting. Even though there are times he can go a little bit over the top, I still believed him as a general threat to planet Earth. Henry Cavill also does really great as the Man of Steel. Again, we have an actor who pretty much is working with a character that isn't fleshed out enough. Still, he does really well in this role. 

So, did I love or hate Man of Steel? Honestly, I thought it was... okay. And No, this isn't a cop out. Though the film is undeniably flawed, there is good things in the film as well. I mean it has great acting and very impressive visuals. With that being said, the film is flawed with a very thin story filled with very thin characters. Still, is it enough to hate the film? Well, even though I don't hate Man of Steel I see why a lot of people do. When you're a huge fan of Superman or maybe just the DC Cinematic universe in general, you're not expecting a generic blockbuster filled with just explosions and visually stunning worlds. You're looking for a whole lot more like great writing and storytelling along with characters that are relatable. So if anything I can see Man of Steel as a huge disappointment, but definitely not the worst movie of the year."
"Dec 23, 2013",POSITIVE,Big action in this remake...a fun movie and a great twist on the original.  Lots of action but still keeps a good storyline going the whole time.
"Dec 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"to me this is one of the best films of the year with a great story and good acting, directing, and acting my only problem with the movie is half the dialog, it just doesn't really sound like how actually talk"
"Dec 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,Really nothing special but this a HUGE improvement over the last few attempts. Solid superhero movie but nothing to write home about.
"Dec 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"One of the few remakes that lives up to the original. Great film, look forward to the sequel."
"Dec 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"While Man Of Steel doesn't quite live up fully to its hype, this film has some of the most elaborate and amazing fighting scenes between Superman and his enemies. Overall an incredibly entertaining film to watch  - especially with elements of Christopher Nolan's influence, which helps strengthen this darker take on America's favorite superhero!"
"Dec 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie with a new, darker insight into the man of steel. Henry Cavill does a marvelous job.  Wish some of the other human characters were a little more developed (I.e. Amy Adams as Lois Lane) but there was a lot to cover in this jam packed movie."
"Dec 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,Decent movie in its own right. Solidifies the fact that Batman is better than Superman.
"Dec 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"Loved it! Great special effects. Humor and puns were a good touch. Better than all of the other previous ones, in my personal opinion."
"Dec 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Wobbly cam is not cinematography and telling a story through cut scenes is stupid. This movie had the cast, the special affects, and the budget but the story was just wrong."
"Dec 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"So many good parts, yet so many bad ones (video game)."
"Dec 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"A very dark and realistic version of the iconic superhero that can be very disturbing for children but very endearing and smart for most of DC Comics fans. After All, this film does justice to the character and can be a very good start for a film saga of the DC Universe. In Snyder we trust!"
"Dec 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is a great reboot, wonderfully cast, decent paste on timing, but a well grounded version of a sci-fi action genre. Zack Snyder did a wonderful job re-imagining this icon, can't wait to see what more is to come in this reboot."
"Dec 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"A Classic, solemn reinterpretation of a much loved character."
"Dec 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,"So you know the drill, Superman is sent away to planet Earth as a baby by his parents as his planet blows up, he lands on Earth and is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent, we see him growing up, he finds out that he comes from the planet Krypton and decides to follow in his father Jor-El's footsteps. Overall I hate this movie: It tries to be dark but gives a nod to the original franchise which makes it not dark enough, the product placement is horrendously blatant, the Jesus imagery/symbolism is painful, the action scenes are just for eye-candy, Hans Zimmer's score is starting to get generic, the ending is as stupid as fuck, most of the scenes are just exposition that go nowhere and the acting is just bland and boring especially from Amy Adams as Lois Lane and Michael Shannon as General Zod making Russell Crowe as Jor-El look the least bad. Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent was incredibly unintentionally funny during his death scene. Laurence Fishburne as Perry White was useless and finally, Henry Cavill as Superman was rubbish! They turned Superman Batman and Batman Superman; Thank you TDKR! And now people will be bitching ""you leave Christopher Nolan alone!"". I'm sorry but when did I hate Chris Nolan? Not a single movie has been hated by critics and just because he produced one bad movie, you're going to turn the hater bullshit on me? GO FUCK YOURSELVES AND DON'T EVEN BRING THAT BULLSHIT ON ME! Then they say, ""You don't get it, it's supposed to be dark!"" well I do get it and it's not dark enough and finally they say ""Ok genius, how do you make it more darker?"". OK first get rid of all the dark colours and you can make your main character more angsty. Oh I guess you'd think that would ruin your movie you idiots. This is to the once-flawless director Zack Snyder: ""Zack, my man, I defended the hell out of your last film Sucker Punch. If you can't pull off the Superman vs. Batman crossover with Henry Cavill and Ben fucking Affleck, you officially have gone down!"" Man Of Steel can suck my balls and that's why it gets a 1/10."
"Dec 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,not saying its a bad movie but its also not that good. The mix of present and past kind of irritated me and I felt they tried to squeez in most of the action in the last 30 min
"Dec 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,Enjoyable.  But lacking in qualities that would make you want to watch it more than once.
"Dec 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,a decent remake pf Superman. with Zach Snyder at the helm I expected special effect central and wasn't let down on that part. There were parts in the beginning that moved so fast about getting info in there for a 2 an a half hour movie made me believe that it was gonna more action than story and character based.
"Dec 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"I learned to look at the comic book movies as if they were comic books you have different story arcs that had different writers,artists,and editors so while this movie was different and had much changes to the ""superman story line"" I just see it as a ""superman revamp"" I like 90s and the new 52 superman better than golden age/super friends sup so its all in the eye of the beholder, I like it"
"Dec 23, 2013",POSITIVE,Loved it. This movie was definitely better than the last Superman movie.  Henry Cavill is really hot.
"Dec 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"As someone who isnt a fan of superman I really enjoyed this movie with great special effects an enjoyable soundtrack and a surprisingly good performance by Henry cavill this movie doesn't disappoint, only problem is after a while it all feels a bit deja vu."
"Dec 23, 2013",POSITIVE,good film. not a classic but so much better than superman returns.
"Dec 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,It could be better.. in 2013...
"Dec 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Man of Steel is another remake. The film showed his darker color like Nolan Batman. This time, the villain is General Zod Michael Shannon played. He had not even a villain, he makes krypton. Villain of it was very charismatic. Genri Cavill decides  perfectly with the role of Superman. From Amy Adams got a great Lois Lane. Both father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner). Great visuals, cool action and great music."
"Dec 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Wow, didn't think I'd find a movie I thought was worse than Pacific Rim this year.  Congrats Snyder, you hack."
"Dec 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Granted, this is a dark movie, and Superman should never be dark, that's Batman's trademark. But towards the end of the movie, (SPOILER ALERT) with Kal screaming after he kills Zod, hopefully means that he will have learned. As long as the sequel doesn't involve Clark killing anyone, I'll be okay with this.

Also, the way that the Kryptonians haven't fully developed their flight power when they first arrive on earth is genius, as Superman in the original comics wasn't able to fly."
"Dec 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,Awesome and very well made
"Dec 22, 2013",POSITIVE,I'd say this is the best Superman movie to date.
"Dec 22, 2013",POSITIVE,"As long as you remember that this is a complete retelling of the original Superman lore and origin story, it's a fun movie that goes deeper into the Kryptonian way of life and purpose than the past movies did.  The Special FX are awesome and downright jaw dropping ro watch.  The whole movie really focuses on Superman being an ALIEN, for it's retelling of it's origin story.  So get used to the spaceships and laser beams clich√É (C) because the movie does rely on it very heavily. Just FYI. 

The plot did feel a little neglected, but that's pretty much true for any origin story, witch tends to be retold so often that it start to feel boring after hearing in so many times.  The action and violence was a little on the heavy side and not something seen in the past Superman movies, but if you're going to save an entire planet and it's inhabitants from certain annihilation, you have to break a few egg shells.  

In conclusion, as long as you don't compare this movie to the past Superman movies, you'll enjoy it's originality and imagination. 

On the other hand, if you ARE going to compare the past movies to Man Of Steal, you are going to be VERY disappointed!  As most of the stuff from the old movies did not cross over to Man Of Steal...  Not even the original Superman Theme Song, I'm sorry to say. 
All in all it was a fun movie, but I wasn't ""blown away"" by it, as I was hoping for."
"Dec 22, 2013",NEGATIVE,Ok I love all comics movies really I do but this movie sucked bc I felt as if they were trying to hard for it to work bc the others were bad but it's good if your bored
"Dec 22, 2013",NEUTRAL,This was actually a better movie than I had expected.
"Dec 22, 2013",NEUTRAL,You really have to pay atention to the movie from the beginning or you wont know whats going on....but once you get into the movie..it is good...
"Dec 22, 2013",POSITIVE,"Definitely focused on setting up future movies but i, as a martial artist who once was bullied, cried during that scene and several other times throughout (something every other superhero movie ever failed to make me do) and to top that off, superman went from my least favorite superhero ever to my favorite."
"Dec 22, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Not familiar with the comic so not sure how this Superman story relates to anything else Superman relate (and I don't care). That said, the first 20 minutes before he zooms off the planet Earth were a bore for me. I don't like Sci-Fi, and that's what that was. It was much better once he got to earth, but that was short-lived as his enemies soon caught up to him and it got all Sci-Fi over again. So, I like that Superman was low key. I like that it tried to be a little darker film. In the end, more than two hours of Sci-Fi heavy movie is just too much for me. I stopped watching after about 70 minutes but kept it on for another 30 minutes or so, then I just turned it all all together. It's quite well made, just not my kind of movie."
"Dec 22, 2013",NEGATIVE,It was kind of lame...how many Superman movies do we really need? It's not like we don't know how the story ended...
"Dec 22, 2013",POSITIVE,The best movie I have ever seen. !!
"Dec 22, 2013",POSITIVE,"Very good acting, and a refreshing take on the Superman character, making him much more believable than prior cartoonish versions."
"Dec 22, 2013",POSITIVE,Best telling of the Superman story I have ever seen......quite lengthy
"Dec 22, 2013",POSITIVE,Best film of all time! Totally perfect in every way and disagree with many comments on here. Yes it's non stop action but the minimalist in comments and hints of genius within the script clearly have deep meaning and amazing insight into the thought processes of the characters. Excellent excellent film!
"Dec 22, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Heaven forbid Superman is EVER to be enjoyable in my lifetime! However, loved Amy Adams take on Louis Lane and the cinematography."
"Dec 22, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Heaven forbid Superman is EVER to be enjoyable in my lifetime! However, loved Amy Adams take on Louis Lane and the cinematography."
"Dec 22, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Acting, directing, and editing was awesome! Action scenes were phenomenal! However, the story line jumped around so many times that during the first 20 minutes I got confused! By the end, I had no idea what was going on to who and why. Totally made for a sequel. Horrible buy. Nothing is as good as Christopher Reeves!!"
"Dec 22, 2013",NEUTRAL,Finished via several times. Its not as excited as I thought it would b.
"Dec 22, 2013",POSITIVE,Just awesome well made well acted.
"Dec 22, 2013",POSITIVE,"Dramatically packed with appeal, stunningly creative in graphics, a master piece equal to Avengers, captivating with suspense throughout the whole movie (must see, and must own collection).  I await the continual sequels,  the villains were as equally interesting as it's main character ""Superman"". I originally was not sure if the new Superman would fill the shoes of expectations, but he was superb, his acting skills surpassed his expectations with full enjoyment for my family. -A great selection in cast."
"Dec 22, 2013",POSITIVE,straightforward update of the original that makes superman interesting again
"Dec 22, 2013",POSITIVE,This film has fans split straight down the middle some hate it. I personally think it's an amazing movie cheesy at part yeah no film is perfect I love this movie one of my all time faves!!!!  People are way too over critical bout this movie err so much collateral damage how many people died is a movie who cares u lot weren't cryin wen New York was nearly flattened in the avengers I love this movie despite it's few flaws 5 stars. Lovely :D
"Dec 22, 2013",POSITIVE,The best superman movie in years
"Dec 22, 2013",POSITIVE,"Spoilers**
The movie is a very good NEW RENDITION of superman, focusing more on the trials and tribulations of being a ""super being"" in a mundane world. How does he draw the limit of what he can do, with what he SHOULD do, becomes the tell tale sign of the modern movie era. The movie does not disappoint as it keeps true to the IDEA of superman, and the general STORY of superman. The timeline is messed up, the actual events of how people die is messed up, but seriously... would you want to see a remake of an old movie with the exact same script as the original? That's a recipe for failure. They introduced something NEW, while keeping true to the faith of the superman cult. When Zod must die, you see that there is no other option. And you see how much it hurts him to do so. Bravisimo!"
"Dec 22, 2013",NEGATIVE,What a let down not a patch on the rest well miffed boo
"Dec 22, 2013",POSITIVE,very good can't wait for the next
"Dec 22, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie is awesome!:D
"Dec 22, 2013",POSITIVE,"Excellent remake of superman, lots of action and great effects"
"Dec 22, 2013",POSITIVE,"May be a little light in story, my favorite adaptation since Chris Reeves. Great supporting performances like Russel Crowe and Kevin Costner. Mind blowing action as well."
"Dec 22, 2013",NEGATIVE,Super Man was pretty ok before this movie came out!!
"Dec 22, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I put it on later in the evening.  This was my first 3D video and had to see how good the 3D was.  The film: if it wasn't my first 3D video or on tv I would have switch it off and gone to bed. The violence just went on and on.  They could have lost 20 to 30 minutes out of the film and it would have been worth watching. We kept on thinking the film was finished - then more violence. I don't mind violence if it adds to the story but what we were watching was the product of a couple of kids playing a computer game with interludes (they went for a natural break -top up the coke) filled with sections of what probably was a good film.
My other half's view of 3D - like watching a child's pop-up-book.  Well that's ruined watching 3D films for me."
"Dec 22, 2013",POSITIVE,It's Superman. The Man of Steel. The CGI was dope and the plot was easy to follow. It just seemed like they juiced up the first and second act and fell short on what to do for the ending.
"Dec 22, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Definitely see the mixed reviews.  Production was not great, too much CGI, etc., just looked like it could have been produced on a computer.  But interesting story, nicely told for a remake, and a cast that gives it credibility.  Overall worth seeing."
"Dec 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,Better than I thought it would be dang superman was sexy
"Dec 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"Okay, admittedly this movie is a bit heavy on the dramatic music and fight scenes, and General Zod can be kinda cheesy a lot, but I liked this movie.  Superman was portrayed pretty well in my opinion, and there were some good moments.  Overall, I liked it.  Be prepared for some cheese though.  Also, watch for the little references to Lex Luthor; there are a bunch of them all the ought the movie."
"Dec 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Effects were amazing, but everything else was so cliche. It lives off of coincidences and stretches the Superman plot to fit Hollywood's predictable, dramatic, and unnecessary plot."
"Dec 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,"How can you not seriously question the decisions made by characters in this movie? I know it is a superhero film for fun and all, but OMG this movie is off. Will the world ever see a great Superman film? I will say this movie had some excellent camera use and a promising opening sequence, at least."
"Dec 21, 2013",POSITIVE,Simple and well done
"Dec 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I feel like this film could have been so much better if it hadn't gotten so silly in the last act. Also, I'm a big fan of Michael Shannon, but he was not very good as Zod. This was probably Snyder's best film, which is too bad because it was almost a very solid super hero film. Instead, it's turns into a ridiculous battle and a shallow ending after a pretty good setup with some decent performances."
"Dec 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I had very low expectations, as I stand by my belief that Superman is a better symbol than he is a character, and I don't like Zack Snyder. With how low my expectations were, however, this was pleasant."
"Dec 21, 2013",POSITIVE,The movie had great action scenes. More than I expect...four stars for this movie.
"Dec 21, 2013",POSITIVE,Good movie but bad ending. Still good though
"Dec 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,"A very boring version of Superman with a tedious beginning that is packed with flashbacks and too much pointless dialogue. The first half is good to make you sleep, while the only bit of action in the movie is towards the end. The action is very lame by the way. Overall, a very pathetic and disappointing Superman."
"Dec 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Zack Snyder cannot make films, why do people with money keep letting him try. Visually he can copy a graphic novel and make it look resplendent, but the man is incapable of finding the human heart. Any performances in this film, are there by accident. I just didn't care for anyone in this film. So no matter how big they made the end of the film, it was a waste, as I had lost all interest at that point.

Stop letting Zack Snyder make films, it is beyond him."
"Dec 21, 2013",POSITIVE,Superman needs to do a lot of community service to make up for the last 30 min
"Dec 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"This was my favourite summer 2013 movie by far. While i didnt especially like the multiple sub-plots and the somewhat under-developed characters, i did appreciate this new take on superman, having him learn what it means to be human throughout the film. The effects were done really well, the story was smooth enough, and the action was intense when it needed to be. It may not be as happy or funny as previous takes, but it defines what i want to see in a superhero movie."
"Dec 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is the best Superhero  remake ever!!!!!! I hope they keep making the sequels. Superman returns was ok, but not like this one. And all these critics that say they this movie was a was a waste of time are bitter old farts.  YES, the originals are a classic but also cheesy as hell!!!!"
"Dec 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,"the first half of this film was great, the second half was hourendous!"
"Dec 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies ever, it's must see"
"Dec 9, 2013",NEUTRAL,"DavidSGoyer's script plays out more like a #Transformers movie than it does that of the Man of Steel. On a positive note, the special effects and the final battle are both excellent. Just wish the story didn't take such a back seat in order to build up to it. The film ends with a lot of potential however and here's hoping for a superior sequel. Until then, the world will have to continue to wait for a true hero to save Hollywood's #Superman."
"Dec 9, 2013",POSITIVE,Love superman and this movie was great it had all the stuff that I love in a movie ecspecially the action.
"Dec 9, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It's super-sized devastation. This is much like an alien movie rather than a Superhero movie. Like the new superman Henry Cavill. Has a nice cast as well. It's a dark movie like The Dark Night, but one would expect bright settings and atmosphere from a Superman movie. Not the very best of superhero movies but not bad. Unlike other superheroes, it is hard to create a movie for a superhero like Superman anyway."
"Dec 9, 2013",NEUTRAL,"average at best, but with a reboot of an age old story, expecting anything better seems silly"
"Dec 9, 2013",POSITIVE,"I didn't get why everyone hated this movie, in my Opinion, its my Favorite Superman Movie, Amy Adams played a pretty good Lois Lane and Henry Cavill played A Good Superman."
"Dec 9, 2013",NEUTRAL,It's the Superman with a darker tone. I loved the first half because it had such great character development and the tone really fits to this new storyline. And then there's the second half. So basically the first half is 4 stars while the second is 2 stars.
"Dec 9, 2013",POSITIVE,amazing job done by Zack Snyder great movie it couldn't have been done any better
"Dec 9, 2013",POSITIVE,"Good film, worth the effort to get to it.
Would have made a good 2 parter."
"Dec 8, 2013",POSITIVE,"Best Blockbuster movie this summer despite what the critics say, hands down if you want action here it is."
"Dec 8, 2013",POSITIVE,finally a good superman that didnt have all the blah... blah... yawn that Returns had. Great acting and full of action and wonderful effects!
"Dec 8, 2013",POSITIVE,Best superman so far
"Dec 8, 2013",POSITIVE,"A reboot of The ''Superman'' films 
I don't get why people are hating the reboot
Man Of Steel actually shows you how Superman was born and how he got these powers he has. 

SPOILERS-He got them from his father when his father put a wish on him to have powers to protect the world plus Jor-El (Russell Crowe) was the one and Superman's mother. 
I enjoyed it, can't wait for Batman vs. Superman, AKA-Man of steel 2."
"Dec 8, 2013",POSITIVE,"I loved it.

Sure the fight scene went a little long, but it was fun!"
"Dec 8, 2013",POSITIVE,good way to bring back superman less gay than the last one
"Dec 8, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Maybe my hopes were too high, but I thought this movie was disappointing.  Here are my main gripes:
1) Do we really have to rehash the origin story? Does anyone who has even the slightest understanding of pop culture not know how Superman came to be?  But it's not the origin story, in and of itself, that bothers me.  I thought it worked well with The Amazing Spider Man.  Besides an updated and far more believable Krypton, the backstory didn't really add anything meaningful.
2) I think Zach Snyder is a talented director, but he struggles to really utilize the incredible ensemble cast he has at his disposal. He could definitely take a page from Joss Whedon's book in this regard.
3) The screenplay is clunky and uninspired.  I know fanboys were thrilled to learn that David Goyer and Christopher Nolan were working on the screenplay, but it is painfully apparent that the tropes and motifs that worked so well in the Dark Knight trilogy fall flat on their face when applied to Superman.  Also, I think the flashback scenes completely cripple the film's pacing.
4) The movie's running time is obscenely excessive.  There's no way a movie with so many action sequences and impressive special effects should bore me to sleep.  If Snyder can't master the art of editing, he runs the risk of making each of his future movies becoming progressively tedious and unwatchable.  The best thing Snyder can do for his next project is hire a competent editor who's allegiance is to the film and who won't kowtow to the director and studio execs."
"Dec 8, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Blech! Boring, bland lead.  Totally unnecessary remake that turns iconic Superman into a mass murderer.  Absurd.  Save one but take down thousands."
"Dec 8, 2013",POSITIVE,"This film instantly became one of my all time favorites, it does have flaws but they don't hinder my enjoyment whatsoever."
"Dec 8, 2013",POSITIVE,I would only give it a five if it had the romance part and the changing in phone booths. other then that I really enjoyed it.
"Dec 8, 2013",POSITIVE,OMG the new superman movie is so good
"Dec 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,Like the new look. But too many details are incorrect. The camera is all over the place at times. Not much logic or thought put into the storyline. But overall a movie with great potential but with poor execution.
"Dec 8, 2013",POSITIVE,True Superman fans aren't whining about the movie. They know why things happened the way they did. It was a great movie that didn't have the over the top colors/camp of the 1970's versions. People need to understand the reimagioning aspect and move on!
"Dec 8, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel indeed! This reboot is excellent in many ways. Great acting, writing, directing, CG, etc. The action shots were big, and the scenes were emotional. Best thing about MOS? Henry Cavill. He knocked it outta the park - way out!!! Can't wait for MOS 2 and hopefully MOS 3."
"Dec 8, 2013",POSITIVE,Love it. I don't understand the low ratings!
"Dec 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,A morbid and somber superman overstuffed with CGI. Far too long and peppered with nonsensical moments.
"Dec 8, 2013",POSITIVE,This has to be one of the best versions of the superman origins story I've seen in a while. Great cast and loads of action. Would be great to see more movies of superman in the future.
"Dec 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Suffers the same fate as all other Superman movies, he's as dull a character as they come. Film moves at a fair pace and as a result characters and relationships never develop. On the plus side, Krypton back story is well explained and some good action sequences."
"Dec 8, 2013",POSITIVE,"Henry Cavill is Perfect as Superman, Amy Adams is not as Lois Lane. Love Amy in other movies but she is not Lois Lane, doesn't fit her. The violence in the movie is realistic to the way battles would be with Superman and other Super beings. Still delivers a good story even with all the fighting and sets up the Superman's Universe going forward really nicely."
"Dec 8, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The tremendous depth, power and grandeur of John Williams' orchestral soundtrack were replaced by a repetitive, simplistic, artificial, turgid and over-produced score. Hans Zimmer's music is just disappointing in the extreme."
"Dec 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,Was this Superman or Transformers? I had a really hard time staying with it and it seemed to go on and on. Disappointing.
"Dec 8, 2013",POSITIVE,Good for a superman movie!!!
"Dec 8, 2013",POSITIVE,It's worth watching gazillion times; p Thanks Warner Brothers! Kudos!
"Dec 8, 2013",NEGATIVE,I can't see anything new in the superman story. A bit disappointed. Just like watching Dragon Ball fighting.
"Dec 8, 2013",NEGATIVE,About 30 mins too long at least
"Dec 8, 2013",POSITIVE,"Contrary to public opinion this is a very good movie,even though a remake of a popular story,very close to original Detective Comic story where they introduced us to the character of The Superman,Good Movie/Story/Effects /Actors/Music.."
"Dec 8, 2013",NEGATIVE,"(50%)
Not willing to do what 2012's Amazing Spiderman did and simply tell the exact same story again only with minor changes, this instead tries to gloss over much of the origin story with scenes of Clark as a child at school and his earth parents discovering him etc cut into the movie (or cut out completely) in a non linear fashion, as the fact is we have seen it all this before, we know all about it, and the writers know we know it. Cavill looks the part, but Christopher Reeve will always be the best Superman and the relationship between Lois and Clark is hugely underdeveloped. As flashy effects ridden, money thrown at the screen action movies go this is enjoyable and well worth a look, but as a well rounded film there's just not enough depth to see here, mainly because it has already been done more than a couple of times before."
"Dec 8, 2013",POSITIVE,great revamp OK its a retelling of the story but so much better I'm more than sure the next one will have us warm to superman but what a way of starting it off again
"Dec 8, 2013",POSITIVE,At least the fight scenes are more realistic of supermen rather than slow motion sequences we saw in Superman 2. There are scenes that just don't make that much sense. It's just too bad the movie suffers from some poor direction.
"Dec 8, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Unfortunatley, DC comics studio took Marvel Studio's lead in superhero movies.  This movie is empty, plot-less, and doesn't even provide eye-candy special effects.  It adds nothing to the Superman genre.  Like Marvel's train-wrecks, this movie seems to take place in an isolated world with about 30 people that ever do anything or are affected by it. 
(SPOILER if you don't know who wins in the end: The final scene where Superman wins makes no sense since he is clearly out-ranked in every way by Zod.)"
"Dec 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Loads of action,good pace,need to watch it again to see the visuals ,"
"Dec 8, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Pretty disappointed in what should have been a much better film. No doubt had some great moments but didn't quite live up to the ""super"" title. However, is definitely still worth watching as it is somewhat entertaining."
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,My first 3D film at home & love it!
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,It's an amazing movie!
"Dec 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,Decent movie. The special effects were pretty great. The acting and plot weren't that good though.
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,Superman is gonna be a blue lantern? The whole thing is about hope so ... Plot twist time
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie ever. Period.
"Dec 7, 2013",NEGATIVE,A little too much angst and explosion.
"Dec 7, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I think this is probably one of the better Superman movies in recent memories. Of course its not perfect, but its at least a start for DC...they've got quite a bit of catching up to do against Marvel, and I fear that with the next movie, they're gonna try to go balls out crazy..and it might not work."
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,Absolute top film what's  super heroes about
"Dec 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,It was an OK movie better than I seen lately
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,"Loved it, probably the best one ive seen. Russell Crowe at his best & finally a Lois lane I like"
"Dec 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Some really questionable scenes take away from what would have been an excellent movie. Strong performances all around. Very interesting how it explored the history of Krypton to tie in the plot, which was very close to being excellent."
"Dec 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,boring and exciting to the point its just plain
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,Unbelievably Breathtaking!!!!
"Dec 7, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Very disappointed with this movie. Over acted and too much CGI. Henry Cavill looked constipated in many scenes.The story was cold and lacked any warmth. The connection between Superman & Lois Lane seemed awkward and lacked any intrigue or chemistry
There is only so much of baddies & goodies going through buildings or ploughing up a road that one can take. Snorefest closing scene!"
"Dec 7, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Very poor, lots of crap over-the-top effects, terrible story, pointless cameos. Waste of 2h22m of my life. At least I was in bed anyway.
Dull dull dull."
"Dec 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,"In response to the negative comments this film received a couple months ago I personally don't think it's bad.  It does have flaws but the acting is okay, and the story took the step the Dark Knight, and Tim Burton's Batman took which was the dark tone which you never see in a lot of Superman films and it makes it interesting"
"Dec 7, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Someone seems to have reined Snyder in a bit and the film is stronger for it, but it still lacks any real tension, danger, or wonder. Shannon steals the show."
"Dec 7, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Great action. Unfortunately, it had little else going for it. Worst was Superman's character. He didn't have any."
"Dec 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Expected so much. I know its difficult to weave a good plot around a hero that is essentially invincible, but I hoped Nolan could make a difference. Maybe he tried, the story was not as bad as Snyder's direction."
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,won't download onto my tablet...
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,Quality film best I've seen
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,"Bear in mind I am 14 , I thought it was an exciting, action packed film with great cinematics"
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,They made their point in telling the story - in fact by not overplaying too much of the origins of Kal-El (I mean who doesn't know how Krypton's last son got here by now!) they did movie goers a service. But the fighting with members of Zod's forces for as long as they did. OVERKILL.
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,Very amazing reboot to the series. When the sequel comes out I plan on being first in line to see it.
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,Loved all the details but it also made the movie drag a little! I'm thinking if they'd thrown a little more action in there it would've been a 5 star for me!
"Dec 7, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I have to admit, the action sequences are awesome. This is like Michael Bay's wet dreams. But other than that, this film is convoluted, the moral arguments are phony and preachy, and the Messianic symbolism is just pretentious."
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome really Super Man
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,As perfect as a second-remake can be!
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,"Go, go Superman! You've got a nice smile and big muscles too! And you can fly!!! Nice one!"
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,"Henry Cavill gives an emotional performance as Superman. This origin story is emotional, gripping and well paced. The cast was stellar and gave excellent performances. The special effects are bar none and I am quite excited to what the next installment will bring."
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,A truly good retelling of the original reeve version well done
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,"Technically fantastic,fascinating and action packed with a wonderful background music."
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,Great film very well made good story line
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,Another awesome story of good vs evil and another great way to show the legend of the superman myth
"Dec 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A worthy, new origin story made with pride and gorgeously realized! This Superman is worth revisiting! A film not only made for entertainment, but to inspire the world!"
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,loved how they explained how and where superman came from
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,I wasn't a superman fan until I watched this movie!
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,"Nit-pick time: Lois Lane does not survive the pull of a singularity that is pulling masonry off the ground and requires Superman to exert energy to pull away.

A: how does she fall away from the gravitational pull?

B: how does her frame survive the opposing force of Superman pulling away and the singularity pulling everything in?"
"Dec 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This movie suffers under one element. The element is not lacking however, there is in fact too much of it! The overuse of admittedly stunning special effects is the movie's downfall as it makes it seem as if it is nothing more than a fx-addled, money grabbing summer blockbuster with not enough concentration on other relevant factors. The movie does however, offer some fantastic performances from superman himself (Henry Cavill) to the equally if not more brilliant Jonathan Kent ( Kevin Costner). The film has some great chemistry between the two characters and offers a fresh new look into the origin of Clark himself as well as the titular hero Superman. Russell Crowe's role as Jor El is short but sweet, but the highlight of the film is undoubtedly Michael Shannon's portrayal of General Zod who returns from imprisonment to wage a war with Kal El ( Superman) and with a Earth acting as a battlefield as we get to see the two play it out with some more special effects. The film may make original Superman fans cry from both frustration and joy at what Zack Synder has produced. But for those looking for a fun movie, Man of Steel is the place to go. 3/5"
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,"Thought it a bit odd to try and cram S1 & S2 into one movie but it did seem to work, Sometimes the constant action scenes did seem a bit confusing but all in all I thought it was a cracker of a film and a excellent reboot of a series of films that were very much stuck in the 70's/80's era."
"Dec 7, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Not bad, but nothing great"
"Dec 7, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This movie should lose its brand ""S"" just because of how sucky it was!!"
"Dec 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This film boasts very cool visual and special effects but it lacks the character driven story and trauma's that Superman faces, that we see in the previous film from 2005. The flashbacks to the past were some of the best moments in the film."
"Dec 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Though having good points like some speedy action scenes, great actors and Hanz' scores, I feel Zack Snyder failed to show his vision of Superman.
Not dark but not as bright as before, very halfway.
However, also I think this is great challenge."
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,"everyone says 'to much action' rubbish, just about right if you ask me"
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,Superman just got cool
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,Excellent movie. Fresh and great way to re-introduce a character to a new generation. Bring on the sequel!
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,"Non-stop action from the Kryptonians, who show how feeble and weak humans are. They have pace, power and precision in everything, exactly how the screenplay should be. The flashback plot style is the right one, as we all know the Superman story; why bother start it from Kal-El's discovery by the Kents? We are shown Superman's regret in murdering Zod, a very humane depiction of Kal-El, who grew up as a human after all."
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,"A true Superman film, a must see for any superhero super fans!"
"Dec 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,This could what and if ever a real Superman appeared on Earth.. I loved it. Very Realistic.
"Dec 7, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I've seen people praise this for beeing ""realistic""... That's not a good thing for a combic book movie. Comics are meant to be fun, colourful, and entertaining and therefore so should movies based around them. That is why Man of Steel is the worst comic book movie out there. It has none of these features and goes out of its way to lose these features. The ending is terrible, there a lot more solutions than *snap* It is a real shame that DC have not made a good impression on me for future releases from Zack Snyder such as JL or Batman/Superman.j"
"Dec 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It was an okay movie but I expected a lot more out of Christopher Nolan. Too much CGI and violence, fight scenes are not very likeable"
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,One of the best movies i've ever seen
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,Man of Steel is the greatest comic book saga since the era of the Marvel renaissance and a grand beginning for the historic legend that lives up to its hype and popularity for generations to come.
"Dec 7, 2013",POSITIVE,fantastic movie with a new twist.
"Dec 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,Henry Cavill is great as Superman and Amy Adams too as Lois Lane. Soundtrack is epic but there's just too much pointless action and destruction all around.
"Dec 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,A movie that is overall a good movie but I found it dragging out and failing to get the message out. Would not recommend.
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"my reading would have been 5 stars, minus half a star for the ending, the rest Epic!"
"Dec 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,"My expectations were low going into Man of Steel due to a poor trailer and bad reviews, but what I didn't realize was just how accurate those were. This is not a good movie at all. The action is extremely repetitive, which led to me losing interest. How Snyder was able to make action in an action movie boring is beyond me.

I have seen Superman and Superman Returns and one of the commonalities between the two was the similarity in what Krypton looks like. Man of Steel takes a chance by changing everything we already knew about Krypton and turning it on its head. Unfortunately, it was distracting and didn't work. For example, they had dragons and they were riding them. Since when did a Superman movie ever have Dragons?

It tried hard to be different and dark but in the end it was repetitive and bland. I don't blame the cast because I thought they did good with what they had. It's not their fault I had zero emotional attachment to the characters. That blame falls on the director and writers."
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel was definitely a triumph! The reason critics don't like it is because they were expecting a Christopher Reeve Superman Movie. This isn't a remake of his movies, it's a 're-imagining of the Superman Legend."
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,amazing. the view of supermans home planet is a first and well worth seeing!
"Dec 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Good movie, the more I see it the more I like it.  The ending was hard to take but a good retelling in the end."
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,I loved this movie. Despite its flaws i think it is very thrilling and sets things up well for a sequel.
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"Finally, CR can rest in peace, a Superman movie that didn't suck!"
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"Most of the critics missed the mark on this one. This ain't Donner's Superman, and that's not a bad thing."
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"I really like this film!!! I think the action is very befitting of a superhero movie but even more so a Superman movie. A super powered fight will have buildings collapsing and cars and trains being used as weapons!!!! I went to see this in imax3d, 3d and 2d at the cinema and now I can watch it anytime on the iPad."
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great movie. Good visuals.  Great use of the heroes journey.  Loved Superman my whole life, the minor changes (and yes they are minor) only serve to make it better."
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"My favourite Superman film yet. Darkness, Torture, Redemption..."
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"I think on-par with the first Christopher Reeves version.  Not as much humor, but more action.  This Zod is much more believable as a general."
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,Nice leap beyond both Reeves and Routh depictions of Superman..... both of which I loved at the time I first saw this.  I feel this has more of a SMALLVILLE influence.  I really enjoyed MAN OF STEEL even though the ending is suprising to Superman purists.
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,Brilliant it had me hooked from the moment we got to see Cryton all the way to the end. loved the tone and was totally engrossed throughout the entire movie. Beautifully shot and enjoyed every moment. What do critics know?!
"Dec 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,"all building are being smashed without concern of any people well u dont see any anyway hardly ,story was crazy ,a born fighter gets easy beat at the end and i never see this guy do any fighting ,a story has to be made believable"
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"Very imaginative alternative take on the story line. This movie has created a brilliant platform for future sequels. The special effects were amazing, likewise the futuristic environments of Krypton and the technology associated with it. The suit alone deserves multiple awards for the evolved design from the traditional Superman costume. By no means a perfect movie but, but a very good alternative to what we are used to, The soundtrack is amazing Hans Zimmerman delivering yet again"
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,this is how a real superman film is done amazing oh yeah look out for wayne enterprise signs
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"Very refreshing version of Superman. A little bit darker, which I like. You truly understood why he was torn doing good and just doing whatever. The early years of Superman should have more internal conflict. Looking forward to see what comes next now that he is at the Daily Planet."
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie.  Plenty of back story to provide an understanding of who Cal El is and how he has his super strength. Special effects were phenomenal. Can't wait for sequel.
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,all day everyday EPIC EPIC MOVIE!!
"Dec 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,"A long, somewhat-boring, predictable, recycled origin story.
I felt every long minute of it. 
I'm disappointed by Christopher Nolan's story.
The only ray of sunshine is the casting of Henry Cavill."
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,not bad lots of action
"Dec 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Lacks the heart of Donner's films and tries to make up for it with unnecessary special effects and plenty of over the top action that is sure to leave many citizens of Metropolis dead or dying; which begs the question, ""has Superman stopped caring?""  It appears the writer and director certainly did."
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,Was ok. Not what I expected it was to focused on how he grew up.
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,it's awsome it's batter then the aother supermans
"Dec 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Pretty good movie, i like the DC universe, i like super-hero movies, and i liked this movie. It was exciting through-out the whole movie, the special FX were good and the plot was good. Good action scenes, but they were a little to long and it was hard to keep track on who superman was and who the bad guys were. Good movie, good acting, good FX, okay action scenes. I do recommend this to most people who like superman and superhero movies."
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"It's no dark knight, but still remarkably brilliant on its owns right. It turned superman, a rather one dimensional superhero, into a tragic figure."
"Dec 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,"True comic book fans will see this as another attempt by DC to upgrade it's reputation by making the characters more intense and brutal.  Though the minor changes are, indeed, refreshing, the major changes lean a bit towards desperate.  The ""Boy Scout"" is taken away and replaced by the reluctant soldier.  The teenager who develops his abilities to become the man of steel is replaced by the sheltered child who enters manhood without a clue.  Not to mention the attempt at the end of making some sort of secret identity being utterly laughable.  The major plus about it, was that the action was just that...all action, and lots of it.  I give this one 3.5 stars for that factor alone."
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,Loved this movie! As a comic book fan it ticked all the boxes for me. This movie is DC's first step for an expanded universe
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,Everything a Superman movie should be. A welcomed break from Donner movies and a great new version of Superman we could look forward to seeing again!!
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"One of my top movie of all time for me, I love this movie so much with a passion, I understand some of the mistakes but the rest of the movies makes me forget about it, and every time I watch it I like it even more."
"Dec 6, 2013",POSITIVE,I HATED Superman until I saw this movie...This was a raw version of the character I could get into..almost seemed like a marvel character in this movie
"Dec 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,Very good movie. Would've been great if they slowed it down a bit during the action scenes.
"Dec 5, 2013",POSITIVE,This was the best Superman movie yet!  Great cast!  Great action!
"Dec 5, 2013",POSITIVE,awesome! it was not completely like the original story but it was still pretty cool.
"Dec 5, 2013",POSITIVE,"Like the new superman. Great action, nice story."
"Dec 5, 2013",POSITIVE,"A fantastic re-imagining of the classic story, well written and brought to life. Definitely a must see movie"
"Dec 5, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Lacking in the character development he deserves, Superman is the most disappointing character of the decade."
"Dec 5, 2013",POSITIVE,Pretty good movie! Liked the story line and actors!
"Dec 5, 2013",POSITIVE,No major faults with this film I really enjoyed it from start to finish but I think doing a superman/batman crossover for the sequel is wrong there should be a superman stand alone sequel first especially when ( spoiler alert) lex Luther wasn't in the film so he could be the main villain for the second film
"Dec 5, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is the Superman movie I've been waiting for ever since I started reading comics in the mid 80's. While it is heavy on the action I can't see how naysayers use this as a criticism. Superman's main attraction is his Demi-god-like physical abilities, which, despite 5 previous movies, have never been as fully realised as in this film. 

On a human level, we see the making of the hero we have come to take for granted. Maybe this is where so many audience members were disappointed, they didn't want to wait till the last moments of the film or the sequel to see their beloved hero. It's a shame because this is more interesting and believable presenting him. This Superman isn't the innocent naive Boy Scout of the Christopher Reeves era. This Superman has suffered. He has been tempted, with the choice of resurrecting his own people or choose humanity that has hurt and rejected you. His morals and values have been tested to breaking point and remained intact and reinforced by the end. Thus leavening us with a Superman who not only believes in himself but one we can believe in also."
"Dec 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A refreshing revival of a character made for cinema! I loved Supes 1, 2 and Returns, but this reboot should introduce some consistency in the franchise. It's good to see a more action based Superman movie too."
"Dec 5, 2013",NEGATIVE,I like the old Superman films this film is OK but without the superman music it dose not deliver I'm afraid Sorry.
"Dec 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,"If only it decided to reduce some flashbacks and action sequences, and instead give us more time with its characters, Man Of Steel could have been a lot more. That said, while it may be polarizing audiences the world and web over,  Man Of Steel is an exhilarating, stylish, grand reboot that far outweighs the sum of its parts. Kal-El soars once more."
"Dec 5, 2013",POSITIVE,"The Man of steel given real soul and purpose at last, gets away from the comic nonsence, more realistically done. great job!"
"Dec 5, 2013",POSITIVE,"Best version of Superman since Superman the movie in my opinion. unlike the others it addresses what those films didn't what would happen if an alien from another planet claiming to be there to help us? would we embrace him and adopt him as one of us and look to him as our hero as the original did or would we be wary of him and treat him with suspicion  thinking he was there for some other other reason and agenda just like this film looked at? It also deals with him coming to terms with trying to control his powers when he first gets them and how scared the first experience of his powers make him as well as touching the questions he has when he finds out he isn't who he thinks he is and the conflict within him of trying to fit in to a society like ours when he's so different. All in all the trio of Snyder, Goyer and the always faultless Christopher Nolan have taken one of the great Heroes of our time and given a fresh Reboot and Fresh look For this cenury and i can't wait to see Man of Steel 2 and see how they fit Batman And wonder woman in to the mix."
"Dec 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,"St arts off good and from then on gets worst and worst a boring plot that moves no where for the first half of the film, some of the most boring characters ever put to screen that you in no way care what happens to them in the end, action scenes that are stupid , tedious and will make you laugh not to mention that the villians are so sterotypical you only know the name of two of them. The direction of this film is pretty much laughable at points and some of the action scenes are very hard to watch and understand what is happening. they really missed the mark with this film"
"Dec 5, 2013",POSITIVE,"Excellent reworking of the superman story, loved it!"
"Dec 5, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Really? Could this movie have been any worse? Bad directing, humor that missed the mark, worst on screen kiss of the year."
"Dec 5, 2013",POSITIVE,Amazing. Forget what you know and just watch.. and enjoy!
"Dec 5, 2013",POSITIVE,Best superman movie!! Cannot wait for the man of steel sequel:)
"Dec 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,New update of Superman is pretty violent and not quite as tight as Richard Donners original. But great casting of Henry Cavill as Superman added with Russell Crowe in a minor role as Jor-el. Amy adams makes a much more convincing Lois Lane than Kate Bosworths dreadful attempt. There is a lack of humour but it is very action packed with Michael Shannons OTT General Zod (Stamp was better). Entertaining but the Sequel now as we know features Ben Affleck as Batman and maybe Wonder Woman setting up a Justice League movie
"Dec 5, 2013",POSITIVE,"Really good effects/cgi. Overall a really enjoyable film, ending seemed a little rushed but thats just my opinion. I'm gonna watch it again I thought it was that good. Peace.."
"Dec 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,Lame at the start but wait till the final fight scene!
"Dec 5, 2013",POSITIVE,"First and foremost, how dare these sons of B*&^#&'s give The Wolverine a higher rating than Man Of Steel. It was produced by Christopher Nolan and directed by Zach Snyder along with David S. Goyer helping write the story. I personally am not even a superman fan, but I enjoyed it very much, so much, it has convinced me to become a superman fan. The style was gritty, the beginning jumped around a lot but kept you in the loop. Perfect cast. Not to mention Russel Crow as Jor-El, phenomenal acting, I mean as a father figure it was to perfect. The whole opening was filled to the brim with non-stop entertainment. Man Of Steel should be up there with some of the greatest superhero movies of all time. A lot of these critics have no idea what they are talking about, and it seems they are just running their mouths because they need their next check. Do your research about a comic book before you bigoted bastards start saying this movie had nothing to offer but action, it wasn't supposed to be a love story genius, it was a origin story, you should even be satisfied they decided to put Louis Lane in the movie. But for those of you who haven't seen this movie yet, I recommend you check it out as soon as possible."
"Dec 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Following in the footsteps of recent  superhero movies that have the fingerprints of Christopher Nolan on them, ""Man Of Steel"" certainly provides a more gritty take on the Superman franchise, and the results are mostly positive for this viewer. 

While the opening half hour looks a little bit more like something you would see in a movie like Prometheus, let's say, it still does a good job of setting the stage for the movie, and providing a quick backstory for the movie to get it's jumping point from. 

From there, were introduced to Clark Kent. Through flashbacks, were able to learn much of the upbringing, from his humble beginnings in Kansas, to his constant struggle that comes with the gifts he possesses, and how he (and the world) can deal with them. 

The visuals of the movie are stunning, and the sound is also top notch.  And there's violence a plenty to be found throughout the entire two-plus hour movie. 

Those who are big fans of the Superman franchise will certainly have their bones of contention, however. 

While the violence is fun for this viewer (and pretty much constant throughout) the fact remains that there are certain charms that should accompany a Superman movie that are simply missed.  Due to his decision to hide the powers he possesses, there isn't much of our hero showing off his skills to the adoring public. There's also no quick change via a phone booth. And the real heartfelt, romantic spark interaction with Lois Lane isn't fully unleashed until the final frames of the film. 

However, it must be said that this was in essence a reboot, an origin story, and those previous charms that were overlooked here could certainly be implemented in upcoming films, when the script isn't so shackled by setting the proverbial table and detailing the how's and the whys, and has a little more freedom to run. 

If you're a really big Superman fan, this review is admittedly not for you. After all, I can't call myself a big fan, and don't have that great of a grasp on the source material.  With that in mind,cI went into the movie with little to no expectation. 

And was really pleased with the results. 

Was it perfect?  No, of course not. Does it respect the source material to a tee?  Again, I'm not really sure. But as a fan of the comic book genre, looking for a two hour escape to watch some explosions, super powers, and heroes against villains, I wasn't disappointed."
"Dec 5, 2013",POSITIVE,I preferred the last reworking!
"Dec 5, 2013",POSITIVE,This is simply an awesome movie. Great storyline & action. The perfect superhero movie. Can't wait for sequel.
"Dec 5, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie is wayyyy better than returns and uses Supes powers the correct way I have all kinds of love for this movie I even like how they let Lois in on who he is. The only issue will still be the glasses. There just has to be a better way to hide himself.
"Dec 5, 2013",POSITIVE,"Not your average comic book movie. Taken from the pages of John Byrne to  J. Michael Straczynski, the man of steel comes alive on the big screen. A movie that casually tries to inform the newcomer but embraces those already in depth with the Superman myth including everything of your last son of Krypton but the Eradicator."
"Dec 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The Man of Steel was a decent movie. The action was perfectly directed, the emotions well expressed and the moral doubts well delivered. However, the story itself was pretty weak, with loopholes all over the place. Still a movie worth watching for fun action entertainment, but it isn't as deep as the Nolan Dark Knight trilogy as most had expected."
"Dec 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,Found it decent at best
"Dec 4, 2013",POSITIVE,I'm a huge fan of superhero comics and movies.  I thought it was a great retelling of a story that goes way back. so suck it up people. it was a good movie.
"Dec 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Ugh, I want to be 50/50 on this movie.  It was excellent in all of the technical aspects.  The cinematography, the special effects, the casting.  The various battle scenes are amazing and beatifully executed.  But damn, way to overreach on storyline and put absolutely no effort into dialogue.  There is an inherent difficulty in bringing comic books to screen: they had hundreds of installations with plot development and character exposition, and you want to cram it all into one movie.  But this was an absolutely failed attempt to encompass WAY too much Superman lore in a single sitting.  And I can't emphasize enough how laughable the dialogue was.  It's like you wrote everything for a silent film and then did a bad lip reading.  And the lapses in logic... I know it's inappropriate to demand realism from a film with interstellar travel, but try JUST A LITTLE to use something other than a black hole within Earth's atmosphere.  I could not suspend disbelief for much of this movie, and had to pretend to suffer some kind of amnesia and just enjoy the pretty scenery.  The blend between campy comic book and gritty realism just didn't work."
"Dec 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"I love this incarnation. A great update of the mythology of our VERY FIRST super hero...

I guess I'll just say that I disagree with EVERY negative thing I've read from people who managed to find something to gripe about in this movie. 

The score rules. the cast is great. the carnage is second only to the excellent animated series. & Zod is a twisted motherfucker of a villain... 

Bring on Batman V Superman! :)"
"Dec 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great movie, looks amazing, thought provoking. I like the classic Jesus story that's integrated into the plot. Although it is a lot to take in, plot-wise, the fighting, the special effects, and all the mixed messages throughout that kind of add up to nothing in the end; maybe because Man of Steel is the first in a line of more D.C. movies to come. I think the best way to watch this movie is with at least one intermission in the middle somewhere. It keeps you on edge the entire film. I wish the slower moments in the film didn't have to be all philosophical, and make you question your own beliefs. Which is a good thing, but c'mon this is a Superman movie. The acting is superb. You can tell that every actor takes this movie seriously. Henry Cavil looks amazing in the suit, and is very charming too. His emotional performances standout too. I like Amy Adams too but I thought the actress that played ""Faora"" was way hotter. Sometimes I'll watch this movie one scene at a time because again, it is a Hell-of-a-Lot-of-a-Movie!  I can watch the scene when he learns how to fly like a badass, again and again! Gives me the chills."
"Dec 4, 2013",POSITIVE,The action scenes are amazing.
"Dec 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,A very unique spin on the Superman story. Very unexpected. The plus to this movie is Superman displays his powers as they should be.
"Dec 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Instead of seeing a realistic, gripping exploration of the Superman character, I got 2 hours of building-smashing and lens flares."
"Dec 4, 2013",POSITIVE,The fight scene was a bit long
"Dec 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"While I did enjoy the action and spectacle of the film, and I am a big fan of Zack Snyder as a visual director. Superman is an unthinking and self-absorbed douchebag in the film. The importance of human life and property is nearly zero and Earth is merely a backdrop in the galactic battle between Kryptonians. Which technically is NOT what Superman is supposed to be about."
"Dec 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Outstanding. Tells the story of Clark Kent's journey to becoming superman really well, as well as his meeting with Lois Lane. 

I believe it has been slated unfairly because of the hype that surrounds it and comparing it to its original. I feel that if these reviewers had seen this without seeing the original superman films then they would be fully behind this version. It is a reboot after all.

It delivers on every count. Action. Suspense. It is absolutely thrilling before leaving you with a smile on your face and wanting more!"
"Dec 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Starts off slow. Drags a lil in the beginning. But once it gets going its good
"Dec 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Best superman movie since the Christopher Reeves's superman movies; except for superman IV the quest for peace
"Dec 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,Tries to be too different from the original film with the consequence you don't feel anything for the characters. Superman doesn't seem human. The special effects make it look like your watching a video game for the last third of the film.
"Dec 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A solid superman movie. There's way to much GCI and all that destruction of metropolis was totally unnessecary. There were also a bit to many action scenes, but other than that an exciting thrill ride that can keep you on the edge of your seat."
"Dec 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Definitely one of my favourite movies to date, so much better than the feeble comic style original, darker and better by far. Fanboys never get old, they do bore however. This movie I have watched countless times now."
"Dec 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Great film bit. To long but very eNtertaining
"Dec 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Don't know what some of these people are talking about! Excellent reboot of the franchise after disappointment of Superman Returns
"Dec 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"David Goyer & Christopher Nolan did an amazing job casting this movie. Christopher Reeves will still be the ""original"" Superman, but Henry Cavill as Clark Kent/Superman was as close to perfection as you can get. AMAZING film and can't wait for the next one!"
"Dec 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,loved some parts. story line was weak. missing humour and romance
"Dec 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Las secuencias de acci√≥n son buenas pero el actor, como todos, no llena los zapatos de Christopher Reeve. No me gusta Superman y esto fue solo moderadamente entretenido."
"Dec 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Amazing origin story of superman, well made film."
"Dec 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,Decent SUpermen movie.
"Dec 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Great for those who are new to Superman. The details and environment are fantastic.
"Dec 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Much better than expected. Good acting, and a story I could follow quite easily."
"Dec 4, 2013",POSITIVE,excellent film I love it
"Dec 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Slightly too long, but nice update of the superman legend"
"Dec 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"The remake superman deserved, I loved every second of it !!"
"Dec 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Best of the Superman
"Dec 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Loved This Movie, I Saw It With My Cousin The First Day It Came Out In Theater's And It Was The First Superman Movie I Had Seen In Theater's And I Saw It In 3D, All This Happened In The Same Day, So Thats 3 In One Thing's Off My List Of thing's To Do Before I Die, But, I Did Not Like The S From The Cape Being Removed, I Did Not Like Outside The Suit Removal Of The Red ""Underwear"" Either."
"Dec 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,What is the point of rebooting the franchise after Superman Returns if this movie fails to deliver it?
"Dec 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Superhero, the story line it self I thought it was pretty good and so are the acting, however I think it just little bit to long over 2hr, worth watching if you have time"
"Dec 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"I'mma be honost, I was never a superman fan until I seen this movie. I was on the edge of my seat when when I seen the prescreen of the man of steel in theatre. This by far is the movie of the year 2013, no questions."
"Dec 3, 2013",POSITIVE,The greatest film EVER !!!!!!!
"Dec 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,Was good but I think it could of used some more action or a twist to it.
"Dec 3, 2013",POSITIVE,the greatest solo super hero made
"Dec 3, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie ever!
"Dec 3, 2013",POSITIVE,awesome superman introduction
"Dec 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I thought this iteration of Superman 
was actually quite good. Granted, it did take awhile to get through it but I like the character progression, music was good, the directing was good, and the acting was very good. I'm not dissatisfied and would recommend!"
"Dec 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Well... this was... I'm kind of confused here. Going into the theater I had enormous expectations for this movie. I was pumped and ready to go into a new emotional take into the famous story of Superman. And what I got was more or less forty five minutes of that and the other hour and a half... well let's say it didn't stick with my that well. The way the trailers made me expect this movie was more of a slowly dedicated and emotionally striking version of the man of steel (especially the third one, damn!). Still the fourth trailer was more focused in action than in story and that's how saw this movie at the end. The beginning of the movie which takes place in the exotic planet of Krypton, (yeah, when I say exotic I mean giant alien rhinos and really got me emotionally attached to Jor-El (Superman's dad). It actually pulled on my parents strings! Seeing the planet implode in such a way was breathtaking and kind of harsh! Then came the stretch of the movie which I actually feel confused about: The becoming of Superman. From Kal-El being sent to earth it immediately cuts to him all grown up and going. I felt good about this decision, it gave us the feeling of mystery! Then came the flashbacks and these were reeally good! I felt the confusion of Clark and his attachment to his earth parents, the Kents. But then when this ends, (mainly at the reveal of the Fortress of Solitude) I felt that they were going too fast and the buildup lacked something. Then immediately Zod shows up! And I was like ""Woah! I expected this farther into the movie! I'm not ready!"" And then from the first attack on Smallville everything goes crazy! At first I thought the effects where amazing! and the fast paced action was dynamic. But then the scene dragged, and dragged, and dragged. And I felt overwhelmed and kind of bored. I was praying for an break to get into the deeper aspects that the movie had shown us at the beginning! Then it stopped! I was relieved and interested about where it would go from here! And then more action... and more action. I saw that they where going in with those world tearing machines that I saw in the trailer and actually felt worried for the character of Perry running from the destruction! But those scenes dragged even more! The action was spectacular but it lacked substance! Except for one part where Superman can't destroy the machine across the globe and Perry is trying to save the other chick. That was intense. That was... Nolan! Finally! I found you! And then... guess what!! More empty action sequences... Damn, someone went haywire with the effects. The fight between Zod and Clark began with a good setting of... well ash. It was nice to see something new. That fight I really liked but maaan, content pleease! Then the movie ends and Clark goes to work at the Daily Planet and and yeah, the second half of the movie left me so mind numb that I didn't give a about the ending. Otherwise I would be cheering for that scene. An aspect that I want to highlight is the relationship between the Kent mom and Clark. I really felt something in that mother to son relationship. Henry Cavil also lacked some emotion. Russel Crowe and the Kevs Costner were pretty good and inspiring in their roles. To summarize my experience I cried more in the trailer than in the movie. That being said, it was not BAD! I only expected something greater."
"Dec 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed the action sequences a lot. The story leaves a lot to be desired. Without spoilers, not showing your super powers does not imply you have for be a coward."
"Dec 3, 2013",POSITIVE,best movie of superman I ever seen
"Nov 22, 2013",NEGATIVE,What I expected from Snyder
"Nov 22, 2013",POSITIVE,Love this version! Definitely one of my faves!
"Nov 22, 2013",POSITIVE,"LOVED IT! It wasn't petfect, as far as story line. But it was well done, great acting and colorful. Over all, 143 minutes well spent. Will watch again. =)"
"Nov 22, 2013",POSITIVE,"Djjwdsj,ldddfddfdddfdffsfsdxd"
"Nov 22, 2013",POSITIVE,Best superhero movie since the Avengers
"Nov 22, 2013",POSITIVE,Best version of Superman since the original Christopher Reeves in the '70s
"Nov 22, 2013",NEGATIVE,The fact that this got better reviews by 'the critics' than B v S is asinine. The first hour of MoS was an absolute chore to sit through. Then the movie finally started.
"Nov 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I say it could've been a more balanced story. Meaning it jumped around so much that you can't really get the story trying to be told. It was very action-packed, and Superman actually throws numerous powerful punches, which is excellent compared to the prior Superman movies. I'm satisfied overall, I really enjoyed the movie. Let's look at it like it was the very first Superman we've ever encountered, a whole new take. I loved the new take. I know the Superman/ Batman movie will br amazing. And I also think that Ben Affleck with be GREAT* Batman, just saying."
"Nov 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Cast: Russell Crowe, Laurence Fishburne, Kevin Costner, Amy Adams, Mackenzie Gray, Carla Gugino. Ends up with endless declamation, endless violence ... and endless frustration; essence of 'Superman' is completely missing. Was confused whether I was watching 'Superman' movie or 'War of the Worlds' or 'Independence Day'!"
"Nov 21, 2013",POSITIVE,Great retelling of one the best superheros
"Nov 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"best superman movie ever, it even made my aunt a fan. now, if only they'd team up for a dbz movie to make up for the trashy one in existence..."
"Nov 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,Thanks to Donner for the 1978 version.
"Nov 21, 2013",POSITIVE,Not too bad and full of action.
"Nov 21, 2013",POSITIVE,awesome take on the Superman mythos.
"Nov 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,"While I felt the movie as a whole was good, there were many times I wanted a little more character development and personality for superman.  Another knock on the movie for me was the overlong prologue that was convoluted. Again aside from my couple of gripes, the action was great, it was beautifully shot, and the acting is top notch from all involved."
"Nov 21, 2013",POSITIVE,I was riveted from the beginning.
"Nov 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,Decent reboot for a superman movie but story wasn't great and the action was a bit too much
"Nov 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,I cannot give more to a movie where there is an indestructible being. Wheres the fun in that?
"Nov 21, 2013",POSITIVE,Amazing movie!!!! Couldn't ask for more from a Superman movie... Except maybe a Batman cameo
"Nov 21, 2013",POSITIVE,i liked it it had a lot of action in it
"Nov 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"Create Imagery and special effects, but the balance leans a little bit too much towards the action. Sometimes even within an action scene you forget the plot, and ask yourself ""Why are they fighting again?"""
"Nov 21, 2013",POSITIVE,Nice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
"Nov 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The tepid reviews are rightly earned. This is a film with some interesting ideas but without the sense of magic that we expect from the Superman tale. It almost feels like a home movie with access to tremendous special effects with actors never truly convincing us that they are in fact Superman, Lois Lane, Jonathan Kent etc..."
"Nov 21, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie...superfan of visial effect.
"Nov 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"I loved it. 
They changed it for a reason. It's a new generation and the way they changed superman into a more gritty story is fantastic. 
5 stars."
"Nov 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"Good story line.

Didn't know the actors so I could speak to their characters in other movies so yeah lol"
"Nov 21, 2013",POSITIVE,First superman movie I've seen and loved it
"Nov 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"the Avengers fought a whole army in a city and didn't do as much wanton destruction as Superman vs a handful of baddies...
regardless, fun and entertaining... 

PS: can we please have a prequel about Jor-El!"
"Nov 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Displays the trappings of a superhero movie, Man of Steel is quite a bore."
"Nov 21, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie!  It was nicely done.
"Nov 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,It wasnt that good of a movie for casual people to watch that don't know much about superman. Also the ending was pretty bad.
"Nov 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"Good, could have been better."
"Nov 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,Great start and fantastic finish. Great way to reintroduce Superman. Hoping they will do with DC what happened to Marvel.
"Nov 21, 2013",POSITIVE,great super hero movie of all time reminded me of why I got into them awesome movie!!!!
"Nov 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,it is a ok to much Alien in no American Flag and a lot more faster there a few funny scenes there towards the end.
"Nov 20, 2013",POSITIVE,One of the best superhero movie ever. Breaks the common law for a superhero a little bit; unwittingly laws rarely break in superhero movies and TV shows especially superman movies and TV shows. Its the best superman movie ever hands down.
"Nov 20, 2013",POSITIVE,"Best movie of 2013, amazing acting from cavil and the whole story is amazing, I can't wait for the next."
"Nov 20, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great start towards a DC cinematic universe. Overall just an excellent film, must watch!"
"Nov 20, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie EVER. Period.
"Nov 20, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Straying too far from its comic book origins, Man of Steel doesn't put a twist on Superman so much as reinvent him entirely."
"Nov 20, 2013",POSITIVE,"best comic book movie,  right next to the trilogy of batman."
"Nov 20, 2013",POSITIVE,way better then the last Superman movie
"Nov 20, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man Of Steel was FANTASTIC! the acting was great, the effects were great, the casting was great, the action was great, the visual was great, and the pacing for the origin was great! i thought henry cavill was a great superman! michael shannon did a fantastic job as zod, the story was well written, it deals with the situations superman struggled with growing up on earth, the reasoning for superman being special not just because of his powers, but because he was born with choice, so what if superman wasn't able to save people, he had to fight other super powered kryptonions who might add were combat experienced and machines, he can't be everywhere at once, he was able to save the whole entire planet! the action was fan-@#&^ing-tastic, the designs for the environment for krypton and the kryptonion suits and equipments were marvelous! this truly shows how a superman movie straight out of the comics should be! and it shows how the world would really react to a being who has this much power! so what he's missing the red cod piece? so what he couldn't save the entire city of metropolis? so what clark's father didn't want him to show off his powers, he knew clark wasn't ready yet, and people weren't ready to be aware of his existence! and so what if he kills zod at the end??? what else was he suppose to do?? let zod kill those families? if he let zod go, more and more and more people would die! superman did what he have to for zod, because zod was superman's opposite, zod had superpowers like superman AND was bred as a soilder! so was he suppose to let him kill those families and kill god knows how many more people?? there wasn't a way to make superman or any of his kind that walks on the earth weak, so he had to kill zod, and he obviously wasn't happy about it! the movie overall was fantastic! i'd recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan or a die hard fan of superman! rotton tomatoes shouldn't have given it 56 percent, it should've given the movie 90 percent!!"
"Nov 20, 2013",POSITIVE,"For me this movie had everything. A little bit of some laughs, plenty of drama and the start of love! I am very excited for what else is to come. I also love how much of Krypton we got to see, I loved how much screen time his parents got (all of them). This movie was awesome, all the fights and the CGI was great! Who they picked for Superman... Is so spot on in my opinion it's crazy! Great movie. Owned it immediately. Watched it immediately."
"Nov 20, 2013",POSITIVE,"As the biggest Superman fan, I admit I was excited but extremely nervous before watching the movie when it came out because of my bit of disappointment with Returns. Only because I want my childhood to succeed and once again reign as the daddy of all superheroes..so anyway I came out of the first time viewing a bit confused and not sure what to think but of course I was going to watch more than once...Each additional time I watch it, I appreciate it and love it even more than the last..I understand more of the story line and the way Snyder interpretation fits with the mythology...The guy really loves and appreciates the character and he made almost the perfect for my hero."
"Nov 20, 2013",POSITIVE,Very good action thrill movie. Just what every movie action viewer wanted great story line and action packed thriller the only part really didn't like and dats my whole reason 4 a 4 star rating and not 5 star was tryin 2 keep his a identity a secret especially 4rom Louis Lane which I know according to the story line Clark Kent doesn't meet her until he works 4 da Daily Planet and yet she was part of da action with Super Man even inside da bad guys 4rom Krypton
"Nov 20, 2013",POSITIVE,Greatest superhero movie ever !
"Nov 20, 2013",POSITIVE,Very well done!! All actions and graphics were excellent.
"Nov 20, 2013",POSITIVE,What a great reboot. This topped Superman Returns and had the serious and dark tone of The Dark Knight Trilogy. Great acting and plot make this a must see!
"Nov 20, 2013",POSITIVE,"Best Supes movie yet, and a lot better than than the majority of Marvel movies (first class , and iron man 1&2 are still better)"
"Nov 20, 2013",POSITIVE,Excellent movie. Superman at his best.
"Nov 20, 2013",POSITIVE,No superman movie comes close to this masterpiece
"Nov 20, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Oh what could have been!  
The change in the storyline is very intriguing, however; there is no flow or character development; the movie becomes stagnant within itself.  
Man Of Steel is worth a watch if you're a fan of the Superman movies but be forewarned not even Russell Crowe's presence can save this misfire."
"Nov 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I did not enjoy this movie, as I like Cavill, he did not measure up to my superman. I thought Welling would have been a better choice...just my opinion. Superman should be like a ray of sunshine and hope. This Superman was way dark. Just not my cup of tea."
"Nov 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,"overall great movie, but the nerd in me hates that it didnt follow the original superman story"
"Nov 20, 2013",POSITIVE,Love this concept!! Superman is hardcore
"Nov 20, 2013",POSITIVE,"A well put together film that tries to realistically depict what would happen if people with these kind of power levels actually existed.  Through the intense action and destruction, the heart and reasoning os Superman shines through.  Great performances all the way around."
"Nov 20, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie is dope I love it.
"Nov 20, 2013",POSITIVE,Everything but the ending is good.
"Nov 20, 2013",POSITIVE,superfan not pleased with little changes
"Nov 20, 2013",POSITIVE,"Big thumbs up on this movie. I liked it better than the Avengers. Also, it holds up better on the second viewing than Avengers does!"
"Nov 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,"In addition to the unmistakable Christology going on here, there are also some not-so-subtle anti-statist messages. And for those of you who like the action-packed melees more commonly associated with the Marvel universe, there is much to appreciate here."
"Nov 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,Great action but at the end there is no way ms lane didn't recognize Clark kent
"Nov 20, 2013",POSITIVE,A great return for Superman with room to get better and it will get better. The vision for this movie was well thought out...I look forward to next film
"Nov 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,slower movie. good action. end got long.
"Nov 20, 2013",NEGATIVE,"this movie has it all wrong. if you know anything about comics, youll see that theyre butchering superman to try and make it 'darker' 'relevant' and above all profitable. Superman Returns was the right direction, and it covered ALL the bases if it hadnt been derailed as a franchise"
"Nov 20, 2013",POSITIVE,"Excellent representation of this classic super-hero's story. Definitely messed up on the idea of Superman's beliefs though. Superman is about ""Justice, Peace, and the American way"" yet there is one part that does not properly represent the hero like it should. other than that the movie is definitely a must see for action seekers!"
"Nov 20, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Too long, too laborious for me to enjoy. Then again, I've never been much of a superman kind of person."
"Nov 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,what great hero!!! great movie for the Family!!
"Nov 19, 2013",NEGATIVE,Horrible movie. Substitute story for flair.
"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE,Can't complain. Way better then the previous one. Also it's hard to make a movie that's the superhero is unstoppable
"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE,So so good! Loved it! The movie's so good that it compelled me to research more about it after the movie. Will watch it over and over. Rarely do I give a 5 star rating
"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE,best superman movie ever.
"Nov 19, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Where shall I start.

Louis knows who Superman is before he ever starts with the Daily Planet.

Superman breaking any ones neck. 

To much destruction for any Superman movie, comic or cartoon. 

Superman appears weak and not super!

Did I mention to much destruction! 

If this was not about Superman, it would have been a good movie. There were to many liberties taken in this version of Superman."
"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE,Amazing. I loved how they pretty much told the whole story of Superman's life. The casting was spot on.
"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE,a good master piece for superman fans
"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE,Best movie this year
"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE,"I don't care what everybody else says, this was still a seriously good movie, and perhaps the best take on the Superman story.

Though I don't like Superman that much, considering by this point in time in the comics they've elevated his status to God level and have made him a character that you just can't take seriously any more because of the Mary Sueness in him (and believe me, I never use that word unless I'm describing someone with an absolutely flawless character to the point of making them completely unbelievable), I still enjoyed this film for the mindblowing action and story. It wasn't just a good time, but also a movie that would be great in a series.

Now all I'm waiting for is for a decent Wonderwoman and Flash movie to come out. They failed bigtime at Green Lantern, but hopefully they'll be able to remedy this with two of my other favourite super heroes outside of Batman."
"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE,Best movie everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE,"Astonishing opener, best Superman movie and I don't even enjoy Superman flicks"
"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE,I thought this version of superman was set for our time. The first time I watched it I wasnt so sure if I liked the direction the director took but after watching it for the 2nd time It started to grow on me.
"Nov 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Honestly, I have never cared for Superman. He has always been way too powerful and it really makes for a boring movie when the good guy can kill the bad guy only using a pinky. However, this film had superman being the weaker than the villain (till the end of the film where everything suddenly changes) but overall it was an enjoyable action film. Not great, but not bad."
"Nov 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,"(*** )  Man of Steel, the reboot of the Superman franchise, offers up a good action movie with great effects and atmosphere, while still disappointing in the area of story and script.  I say disappointing rather than failing, because I've come to expect so much from the writing of Christopher Nolan.  As one of the ever-shrinking audience who still considers Superman to be a great superhero, I was let down that his character wasn't given any more depth or that the story wasn't fleshed out any more than it has been in past efforts.  Sure there were a couple of additions such as his time as a nomadic worker, but even this soon gave way to generic summer thrills.  However, if you're going to strictly adhere to formula, you can do much worse than Man of Steel.

The backstory of Kal-El is given in a fairly normal fashion, though some complained that it took up too large a chunk of the runtime.  Only now Krypton is made of a CGI landscape and looks like a combination of several other Sci-fi films.  His arrival on Earth and his childhood are told through a series of flashbacks which serve more to educate those unfamiliar with the Kent story than to truly add plot.  However these are some of the most enjoyable parts of the film in my opinion, which is probably why they dominated the teaser trailers.

The story moves along at a pace which never loses the viewer's interest.  However some of the plot turns are abrupt and jarring, with little attention given to story development and more to just explaining what the next action sequence will be.  This is fairly typical of superhero movies, but once again I was expecting a little more from this one.  Also Clark and Lois' relationship accelerates at an unbelievable click, which takes away from any form of romantic attachment we could feel about them.

Not to complain too much, I'll say again that this movie is spectacular aside from its standard plot flow.  The effects are amazing and some of the ""cool"" moments are truly fun to watch.  Also, some actors (namely Costner and Cavill) fill their roles perfectly.  While I wish that Clark Kent could have been given more depth, Cavill works with the script he's given and embodies the character with a brooding attitude which is a bit more modernized compared to the Christopher Reeve character.  Costner also does a great job, even though his character is given short and sweet screen appearances, one of which involving a tornado is absolutely absurd.

I think the summarized opinion I have of this film is fairly obvious, but the short version is that there is way too much action and not nearly enough story and writing.  Where are all the great Nolan quotes we've come to expect, or all the great psychoanalysis he usually infuses into his films?  I realize that Superman is not as emotionally complex as Batman historically, but why can't he be?  Batman normally deals with the fate of a city, while Superman is more concerned with all the citizens of Earth.  Is that not enough of a burden to give a man some inner depth?  I was satisfied with the movie as a standalone blockbuster, but it was just way below my expectations."
"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE,I honestly tought this was one of the best superman movie!
"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE,"I personally thought this movie was made well considering all the other ""Superman movies"" made years prior."
"Nov 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The only question I asked the whole film is, how he hell is NYC going to pay for all collateral damages caused by that dude in the cape???"
"Nov 19, 2013",NEGATIVE,"As a franchise, it's better than Superman Returns but not by much. Lessons taught at the end of the movie is lost in the final act of the movie. The story felt rushed for time due to an elaborate retelling of Supes origin. The movie gets unnecessarily bleak at times and is devoid of any real connection to the characters on screen.

Fanboys will accept this movie while those of us, who have seen better made superhero movies, will still be left waiting for the definitive Superman movie."
"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE,I'm not a douche who will give it 3 stars or 4 just because the story isn't what people hoped it would be and speaking of hope maybe this movie with superman did not have enough but it's still not a bad movie. Movies are made to entertain and that's all you need for this to be good. It sure was. Just saying
"Nov 19, 2013",NEGATIVE,Jesus Christ (you know what I mean)......am I watching ID4? Transformers? or.....????
"Nov 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,Start was much more interesting then earth life. but good movie
"Nov 19, 2013",NEGATIVE,Save your money for X-Men: Days of Future Past. This franchise is dead. At least Bryan Singer's Superman had a script and didn't destroy all of Metropolis.
"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE,"without a doubt, best superman movie I've watched in a very long time."
"Nov 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,I LIKED IT. HELPED ME UNDERSTAND WHO SUPERMAN REALLY & WHY HE WAS SO DEVOUT TO MANKIND
"Nov 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Good account of supermans origin, give details"
"Nov 19, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I thought there would be more action involved, but overall it was a pretty good movie."
"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE,the greatest Superman move! made
"Nov 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This has got to be one of the most disappointing films ever made. As an origin story it needed people on the creative team who understand  and care about story and character. Unfortunately the film was put in the hands of Hack Snyder and David Goyer. Two of Hollywood's dimmest stars. There is not one ounce of intelligence in the entire proceedings. Instead we're given rushed and messy scenes that don't gel together at all. It relies too heavily on cliche and the arrogance of the people in charge that audience wouldn't notice or even think about whether anything worked or was logical. (Kryptonians getting powers, even though they are on a ship that cancels out the effects of the sun, which is the source of Kal-El's powers). Then there's the over-the-top action that quickly gets very boring. There was no sense of peril. The characters we all one-note, which rendered them little more than ciphers for egos of the ""creative team"". The only saving graces are Henry Cavill (working well with what he was given), the suit; especially the \S/; the colours could have been a little brighter though, and finally Zimmer's score; which only works outside of the film though, as there quite a few moments where the music can't even be heard, or just doesn't fit. I'm thinking of the final piece 'What are You Going to Do When You're Not Saving the World?'. It feels far too triumphant after such a bleak and bombastic ending. It's deeply flawed, yet somehow watchable."
"Nov 19, 2013",NEGATIVE,"""You will give the people an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun. In time, you will help them accomplish wonders."""
"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE,"While it is far from perfect. This movie is underrated. Should have received higher reviews. While the magic of Superman wasn't there entirely, its hard to recreate a character that has been around for so long. Best movie featuring this hero so far to date."
"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE,Superman fans rejoice for this new version is simply magnificent.
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,The Movie is amazing I Love it honored to had purchased this alwsome Movie :)
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Fascinating re-telling of the Superman mythology. Many elements of 75 years of storytelling are present. Henry Cavill is perfectly cast.
"Nov 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,"It focuses more on action more than story telling and character development, this wouldn't be as bad if the action scenes were good, they're just people punching each over and add in explosions, the effects are probably the best thing about this film and that is pretty sad."
"Nov 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,better superman as of late
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,A must see!!!!! #1 movie of the year!
"Nov 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,too much loopholes for a famous character movie!! heavily focused on action than story building!
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,The movie delivers on the promise of its title and then some.
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"best superman movie yet.not only that but Henry looks like superman.so how is man of steel,great.i really enjoyed this movie but my problem with it is the cgi I hate cgi sometimes and superman (kal-el) killed zod he had to do it I know and his story is not told in order when he came to earth he is an adult now he is a kid,adult,teen,adult that's the bad.the good it has good fighting in it I like the Easter eggs the cast is awesome man of steel is a must watch movie not the best comic book movie of the year but great and can't wait for man of steel 2"
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Brings Superman and the planet Krypton to life. Makes you believe that the Stories about a boy from Krypton are real just like we did as a child. Worth your time to see multiple time. Thank you Zach Snyder for telling this story the way that it needed to be told. If you didn't like this movie you are not a true fan.
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,best Superman movie ever
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Exquisite.  It's to much; it's perfect.
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Loved watching the history and back story of Krypton
"Nov 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,Not quite perfect but no super stalker man so that alone is worth 3stars
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Super Man movie.
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"I absolutely loved this version of superman. The director went into an emotional side  and darkness of the character. Great direction, effects and great casting. I recommend it to everyone and even those who are hardcore fans to whomever does not know superman. You will know his name in this great film :)"
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,An excellent beginning to the Superman Series Series
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie was awesome
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,best superman...locked good actors.High quality. the middle dragged a little but Really good cant wait for the next one
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie I've seen everyone of them, from the old movies too this newest one. It keep me on the edge of my seat and looking forward to the next one."
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,This was one of the best movies that I have ever seen!!!!!
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Very well set out storyline....good acting. Overall a good ode to the ""S""-man. Giggles when I saw the ""Smallville"" water tower"
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"A fresh take on a Superman origin story that sets it apart from previous movies, while at the same time giving respectable nods to its predecessors.  While the end of the movie was overwhelmed with destruction, I found that apart from that it delivered an amazing ending (which I'm still shocked from) that wasn't laughably questionable such as flying around the planet to turn back time or lifting an island of kryptonite into space."
"Nov 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Way too long, quite repetitive."
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Extreemly well made movie, i never thought superman could be this incredible!"
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Not a great screenplay, but not terrible. This new Superman tells us all about his past and his future. Any person viewing it can easily tell that Superman is Jesus, literally. They make several references that the human race will deny him and kill him. Also, when falling, he forms a cross-shape with his body."
"Nov 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,it actually isn't that bad..
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,People keep comparing this movie to the old ones but what they don't seem to realize is Snyder based this storyline off various comic books not the light hearted romantic film that came out in the 70's. So as a comic book fan this is the Superman movie i've been wanting for years
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,The kind of action and visual effects we've always want to see in a Superman movie.
"Nov 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,Loved this film  great cast intense story line and reimagening of the Origins  non stop action can't wait for the sequel
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,hands down best superman movie made-
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"What it lacks in comedy and romance (and even then it has its moments), it more than makes up for in sheer action and character development."
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman yet! Enjoyed watching it as much or more than the Christopher Reeves ones when i was a little kid! Glad my son has an awesome updated Superman to grow up watching!
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,i really love the super man movies i really and love and i want to watch this movie bad
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"I don't really see what all the critics problems are. This movie had good character development, a very comic book style story, excellent acting, and felt like a realistic portrayal of Superman. Great film, I highly recommend it."
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"It's a great movie, and you all should watch it. Great story, great visuals, great action sequences. But before you watch it, here's a few warnings:
The movie is paced terribly. 
There is very little character development. 
Romance works its way up so fast you'll wonder ""What the heck? Last I checked they just met.""
Flashbacks come in at random moments and you can at times get confused on what's a flashback at what's not if you haven't seen the movie before.
Yes, I said it's a great story, but it can take a few times watching it to actually see what the plot actually is. One second your in present day and the next your in the past. It gets confusing. A lot."
"Nov 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,Decent movie but it's not a Superman movie. You could replace Superman with any nameless hero and the movie wouldn't skip a beat.
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is my favorite Superman movie. It really brought out his character and how he came into existence. I think the team behind this movie knew what they were doing and I think that they created the best version of Superman, in my opinion."
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Happy this reboot happened.
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,It is a good one I like it
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Amazing actors and plot and Henry Cavill really stood out from the rest. Henry, I salute you!!"
"Nov 17, 2013",POSITIVE,My favorite incarnation of Superman to date. Had a few problems with it when I first seen it in theaters but that didn't stop me from enjoying the movie. It only gets better every time I watch it now.
"Nov 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A little too much action with too little story for my taste, but still a good thriller."
"Nov 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,"SENSELESS, WRECKLESS ABANDON."
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"I think this was a fantastic re-telling of the story. The snippets of Clark's youth were just enough to paint a picture but not hover on stuff we already know ; the new take on how Clark and Lois' relationship kicks off was cool ; the visuals and action scenes were epic, yet the characters stories were still strong ; and finally - Henry was born to play this role!!"
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Favorite superhero. Favorite movie.
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,One of the best movies I've ever seen
"Nov 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,The writing team for this movie should be embarrassed.
"Nov 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I agree with most that it was a bit long, but overall a great movie.  Has the potential to be a great franchise."
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,he is sooo hot!! I was melting!
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman film EVER!
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Supermovie !!!!!!!!!!!!
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,One of the best super hero movie ever made
"Nov 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,I was glad to see that this was not the love story Superman chasing Miss Lane all over the world.  More action less fluff = a movie about a super hero I like to watch.
"Nov 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,omg this movie was awful
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,I don't give many ratings nor do I write reviews. The fact I am writing about this means it is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,was skeptical at first but truly enjoy the movie good cast good storyline thumbs up for me!
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,At least it's worth buying on blu ray
"Nov 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"M.O.S....I have questions...
1: How does he shave?
2: Did we really need that much backstory... told twice!?!
3: People from Krypton (sp) were pretty much a bunch of Jerks.
4: If super heroes at Supermans level were real, civilization would collapse to the stone age in short order.
5: Did it really need to be that dark? I mean put Batman and Superman in the same room and they will create a blackhole of moodiness.
6: Maybe Pa Kent is now in Oz?

Last observation: This was still better than the last Superman movie!"
"Nov 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,A loud and expensive suck-fest.
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"I've always felt that you stand up for what you believe in, even if you stand alone. And in my opinion Man of Steel is the best super hero movie ever made. Emotionally it tugs at your heart strings, the use of scientific theories add a touch of realism to aliens traveling through space and how they struggle to adapt to earths atmosphere and Henry Cavill was amazing as Clark/Superman. Loved every minute of this film. Oh, and the action was phenomenal....."
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this movie he is the 3rd best superman actor. Christopher Reeve than Tom Willing than Henry Cavill
"Nov 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"best part of the movie: the supporting cast! Unlike the original Superman, this one puts the emphasis on folks like Kevin Costner & the excellent Diane Lane. both of whom are convincing role models which result in Clark's upbringing. Laurence Fishburne as Perry is kind of predictable. The villains, however, fall short. No Terence Stamp degree of badness here with Michael Shannon --just a lot of CGI & endless mayhem (can someone tell these guys to take it outside, the stratosphere, when they are about to duke it out please?!)"
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,It is a really good movie
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,the best rendition of this character and story.
"Nov 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,It's good but lots of flashbacks I don't mind them but I know some people that can't stand flashbacks they find them confusing
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie better than the previous ones. The story line could of been organized better.
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,The most rich look into Kryptonian culture. Plenty of nods to various DC Comics icons both notable and obscure. Looking forward to more films of this caliber.
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,This movies was very good and very!! Loved how the movie explaining more on what Clark went through then it did from the first one in the 80's. But those superman movies will always be my all time favorites with Christopher Weaves and they did a great job with HENRY in his place. Great actor and hes the only one in a looong time who looked as good ad CW! But the movie was more action pack or just as before and it seems there just might be more to come! And I hope so for this generation! Because Superman is a classic I grew up with and I thought he was a true hero and angel thats good for children as a roll model in SUPER HEROS :-)!
"Nov 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"If I wanted to see an origin story, I would have watched Smallville. Superman is supposed to be a symbol for Hope and happiness, yet this movie was sooooo dark. What happened to happy superhero movies?? Mediocre, not epic."
"Nov 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This movie is splitted into 2 parts: first half is the story and the second half is heavy action scenes.  The story and action scenes are perhaps (by coincidence or on purpose) very similar to ""Dragonballs Z"" series for those who know it. Compared to the previous Superman's movie, this one is more serious & dramatic meaning; a lot less humor. Humor is supposed to be an important part in a sense to show how different Clark/Superman is compared to any other mortals making this hero  more charming. Nice looking visage and strongly built physique of Henry Cavill does not create attachment or bond with the viewers. Nice movie with good story (comparable to japanese Anime) but sorry, it feels dry compared to the old classic with Christopher Reeve. Sorry to be harsh but still very enjoyable to watch."
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Great new twist on Supeman
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,I liked it. These ratings are often wrong I'm beginning to notice.
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie!
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,It was a great movie in my opinion compared to the no fight scene movie of superman returns we do get a lot maybe too much but what would u rather have a lot of fighting or no fighting at all I thought so and plus they develop superman great it's the type of movie where u got to go in with a passion for it and a joyous attitude
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Four stars simply because it was much much much better than the derk that came before it. The plot had some holes (why was his suit in a scout ship, did lois really track down his identity and did the ending really happen - are they all that dense, and why was lois falling when everything else was getting sucked in, even the stuff on the ground.) Still I liked the special effects (especially the nanite forming wave technology) and it served as a good start to the series. We'll see how the next one is since it won't be an introduction. I may actually watch that one in theaters."
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,the best movie ever made . let see how is super-man vs bat-man
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,You've got to be kidding me? Best story line explaining a Superman for our time. Strap on your belts boys and girls! These next few years leading up to a Justice League movie is going to be a bumpy ride!!!!!
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"this is the best superman yet, but Christopher Reeves will always be the best superman."
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"A wildly enjoyable reinterpretation of America's greatest hero. Henry Cavill soars as Clark Kent in this exciting, edge-of-your seat origin story of Superman. Goyer's storytelling, Nolan's producing influence, Snyder's direction, and an all-star cast come together to give us a rousing and inspirational superhero movie that is sure to be a classic!"
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie of all. Must see! Graphics are unbelievable!
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,I love the action scenes
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,I liked the Avengers but this movie surpassed it
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,This is what every Superman fan wants to see. Keep in mind that this is a NEW TYPE OF SUPERMAN and that he can't save everyone at once and that he is inexperienced when villains come to face him.
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie is my opinion
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome movie! Just how I figured Superman to be like my whole life!
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Very very long but very very good
"Nov 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I had to revise this review.  With all of the superhero and comic movies out/coming out, we know that these movies can come with a riveting story, great drama and humor.  Upon replay, I realized that this movie has none of that.  It just has fights.  Fights and explosions.  But I like fights and explosions so I do like the flick.  I really wish this movie had more depth."
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Superman: The Greatest Hero of our modern age of literature, the Man of Steel, and any kid's, adualt's dream. Interpertation after Birthright to All-Star we've seen countless interpertation for the worse and for the better.Man of Steel is only one of these insights of the Justice, Freedom, and The American Way.We've seen worse (Superman Returns, Quest for Peace, and ect.) to better (portrail in Inustice comic, Grant Morrison, and Christopher Reeve (Superman 1&2) ) this is just the filling between in all and I think it tasted satisfying but bitter, a 7.5/10. Hell even a 8/10."
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,great movie with undertones of humanity's receptiveness to alien life
"Nov 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,Don't let your expectations get in the way. Man of Steel is a very enjoyable movie. Just maybe not what you were expecting.
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"I'm not critical to entertainment.  I open-mindedly loved this movie.  I even loved ""Superman Returns"" and was hoping to see the half-kryptonian/half-human grow... but the hyper-sensitive have ruined that, I guess."
"Nov 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Superman is not Batman. Don't try to give him a dark and edgy story to seem more mature. At least this movie wasn't called ""Superman Begins"" or just ""Superman"", becase this isn't Superman."
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,This was the best one yet! can't wait for the next one...
"Nov 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It's aight. Didn't like how they made the fortress, that's stupid. Didn't like all if the destruction, I mean he's superman, saving lives by taking the battle away from the people, not destroying the villains by whatever means necessary"
"Nov 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,Was kind of all over the place with time. But... still had great action scenes!√∞~
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Very good. Well worth the 3rd remake.
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,great movie a must see
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome action-packed film!!
"Nov 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Great Movie!  Can't wait for the next Man of Steel!
"Nov 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Unlike the previous Superman movie effort, this one is well-made interesting, if way too long for its content. I did enjoy most of it though."
"Nov 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"So this movie took more heat than I would have expected considering the criticism that Superman Returns received. To start off, I am judging this movie from the perspective of a comic book fan and as an action movie fan. The cast is perfect, even if they have some physical differences from their comic counterparts. Henry Cavill looks like Superman. Nearly as perfect a cast as Bale was for Batman. This movie is probably about 30 minutes of plot and background sprinkled in with 2 hours of amazing action. This is an action movie. For those who are disappointed in the plot line, quick character development, keep in mind this is a COMIC BOOK adaptation. Tigers can't change their stripes and superheroes can't change their spandex. First, one of the immediate things that I appreciated about the Lois character in this, is that she's not an idiot. She is a pulitzer winning journalist, and she follows her instinct and her leads to discover who Clark is rather quickly. Sorry folks, glasses on glasses off doesn't hold water here. Kudos to the writing staff for resisting the urge to drag out a Clark/Lois romance over the course of 5 + movies and for just cutting to the chase. I didn't come to a Superman movie for a developing romance. There are plenty of those movies out there. Second, this movie doesn't waste much time with back story, presuming the audience already knows the nuts and bolts of Superman's origin. They sprinkle it in, and tell some parts of his origin in a slightly new way, which I enjoyed. Did we really need another 60 minute introduction to Smallville and Clark? Snyder and company didn't believe so, and I whole heartedly agreed. Third, where this movie excelled as a Superman movie was in its ability to display what Superman is truly, truly capable of. The wholesale destruction of Metropolis was absolutely necessary to show the casual viewer, that Kryptonians are like gods among men, and that Superman truly can never cut loose among us, for fear of destroying us. The special effects were amazing, the choreography was better than anything I could have imagined. For those who are Dragonball Z fans, this movie's action sequences and even some themes are very reminicent of the Saiyan Saga (which Snyder needs to do a live DBZ movie...). Again, this is an action movie. And it supremely excels in that regard. Lastly, this is a set up movie. I am disappointed that the next installation will include Batman (not because of the actor choice) because there is still a wealth of Superman characters that can be explored without the need for an already familiar character. If the codex isn't a set up for Brainiac, I will be disappointed. Don't watch this movie if you want a blossoming romance story between Lois and Clark. You can watch the same named TV show from the 90s for that. Don't watch this movie if you want to see Clark growing up in Smallville and learning to cope with his abilities, again, there is a TV show for that. I honestly can't understand why people get upset at a comic book movie because it didn't change their lives... This movie moves quickly and makes no apologies. Thanks to Nolan, Snyder, Warner Brothers for giving me the big screen Superman that I've been waiting to see!"
"Nov 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I gave this a 3.5 rating. The story of this Superman is a tragedy and seems to be parallel to the story of a burdened man, who must overcome fear, and sadness in his life...this movie is a downer to say the least, but almost rightfully so. The sub plots are all over the place, with a the storyline originating on Krypton. I honestly think a ""Krypton"" movie would've served best to project ""Man of Steel"" to more of an iconic film, laying out some groundwork and taking out a lot of the ""Origin"" type story. Great actors, great special effects, made this a 3.5....I don't think there was one joke or funny part in this movie, and nothing uplifting at all. I hope the Batman/Superman movie will help develop this character back to the hero we all know."
"Nov 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Love the Nolan touch. A little darker and mature. Keep doing it Mr. Nolan.
"Nov 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,i still hate superman.
"Nov 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Excellent remake till the last battle scene which drags on a bit.  Well worth seeing!
"Nov 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"a good super-man movie,but I still have a problem with super-man's costume not having the red shorts."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Its was a great the best superman movie made had great graphics and a good story line..I like the fact there where super villains to go along with a super hero..
"Nov 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A good movie that was doomed without the element of the fun that it's predecessors had. The destruction rate is probably higher than God's Revelation, and it was such a depressing film. Even the trailer could put you in a solemn mood"
"Nov 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,Too soon for a remake. Plus same story. How about a new story line?
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Great remake love the whole new concept.
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,the Superman we all wanted to see....
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Loved it! That's all that matters!
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Love it the best Superman so far
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is how Superman should be fast, strong, a man of steel. This is the beginning stage of him being the savior of Earth romance and humor will follow, next movie."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this version of the Superman mythos.
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,An amazing movie. A lot of action and suspense. The effects are down right amazing. Starts from the beginning and smoothly goes through him growing up all while keeping up with what's happening at the time. Superman fans and non- superman fans will love this movie. The plot is consistent and the characters are well developed. This movie is a must see.
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,this was a great movie!
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Thought it was great, liked the angle the story was told!"
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed this movie.
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,loved it! edge of your seat ride
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,I loved it. certain plot points had me scratching my head but I truly enjoyed it.
"Nov 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Not bad but fight scenes seemed to be dragged out longer than necessary. 
Holy muscles. I don't remember Christopher  reeve having muscles like that."
"Nov 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I don't know why this got shit on...I thought it was pretty solid. Considering I never even bothered to see the Bryan Singer one. Henry Cavill is great, Amy Adams is her usual annoying self (since when was Lois Lane EVER a redhead?) No Jimmy Olsen??? The real treat here is Michael Shannon as Zod and Russell Crowe as Jor-El. Kevin Costner doesn't get much time as Jonathan Kent, but makes the most of it, including one scene that had me bawling like a baby. It's too bad they are waiting so long to follow up on this, and with an ensemble movie, because this has the potential to be a solid franchise on it's own, but DC seems to concerned with making Avengers-like money...sorry you need to do a lot more work first to set it up. Also, your best Batman is retired. This Superman is good, he never becomes Superman until he's 33 or so (Jesus?) and spends his life hiding because Pa Kent was right about how he'd be treated. I also like that this involves him learning more and more of his powers and of his history as a Kryptonian. It really does set a solid foundation. Worth watching for sure. Yes there's lots of violence, but has anyone read a Superman comic book? Metropolis gets destroyed all the damn time!"
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I like This new version of Superman, The way they have rewritten the story makes more sense to me because for one Lois Lane use's her keen reporter skills to track down and find out who Superman is before he even becomes a member of the Daily Planet. Also Superman's youth makes more sense as well, Clark Kent is not portrayed as a bumbling fool but a normal person who has problems fitting into  society with all the special powers that he has. The battle scene's are awesome and I can not wait until the next movie comes out."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"First and foremost, I believe that the only man that made me believe a man could fly was and still is Christopher Reeve. Now, for this generation Henry Cavill is Superman. I can accept this and be okay with it. The movie was what I expected for this generation Superman to be. For me, it kicked ass! However, Christopher Reeve as Superman will always hold a special part in my childhood heart. Way to go Henry, you the man! Christopher Reeve R.I.P I believe you are now flying for real...."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great up to date adaptation of superman, especially the scenes of krypton I remember from the comics hope to see more of krypton home world and stories, and I noticed the empty pod on the ship who is already hear be next good movie."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie, two thumbs up!!!"
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I've been a fan of dc comics a long time with a long standing loyalty for batman, which still exist to this day, and a disdain for superman.  He was always, for me at least, the guy who needed all the powers in the world to defeat evil and wasn't capable of coming up with a strategy such as the very human batman relied on.. once I saw the Christopher Reeve films I was able to identify the more human and emotional sides of superman that couldn't translate to me from the pages of the comics.. I was in love with the movies which opened me up to the comics more.  From a creative angle, I appreciate Brian Singers very unique portrayal of son of krypton. With that being said he didn't need to destroy one franchise in attempts to start another because I really enjoyed the xmen movies too.  All that being said Zack Snyder does the best job of bringing us a kal-el to screen that should be appreciated by fans.  He does the best job, since reeves, of showing a human side to superman that gives the viewer a better idea and understanding why makes the choices he makes and fights for mankind.  This created a duality in my fandom because now after twenty years I became a superman fan.  Though I'm still very much a batman fan I am able to summarize my affinity for both heroes in  a quote i read from current new 52 batman and superman unchained scribe Scott Snyder.. "" Superman always does whats right, Batman Always does whats necessary."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie was incredible. What has the world come to when a movie this awesome receives so many negative reviews? Someone should make a documentary about today's film snob epidemic. Loved Man of Steel!
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I hate Superman.  I just thought I should make that clear.  Sure, he's like THE original superhero, but Superman has always just really bored me.  And I'll be honest, I've never seen any of the original Superman movies either.  My only exposure to Superman was as a kid watching the 90's cartoon.  So why am I telling you all of this?  To emphasize the magnitude of the praise I am about to give Man of Steel.

I was sold on this movie from the moment I saw the first teaser trailer for it.  I could tell this was going to be a simple, small-town movie that spent a lot of time in Smallville, and little-to-no time in Metropolis; a dramatic, realistic movie that focused on Clark Kent's journey to becoming the man he was destined to be.  This belief was further reinforced when I learned that Christopher Nolan was both the writer and producer.  I knew Superman was about to get the fantastic treatment that The Dark Knight had gotten.  I knew that Nolan would give us this small-town Superman to contrast his big-city Batman.

Unfortunately, Zack Snyder as the director undoes some of Nolan's work by bringing in a significant sci-fi element to this film.  Which isn't entirely bad because you have to expect some sci-fi with an alien character.  In fact, the stuff on Krypton is great!!  I loved it!  But when Zod and the others come to Earth in their alien ships, that sci-fi stuff really takes away from the simple nature of the film.  It was an odd direction to go, and it led to the big, genocidal finale in Metropolis, which has so many people upset.  I understand that in an alien invasion, there would realistically be a lot of fatalities, but this movie goes a bit overboard.

Man of Steel's plot has two plots in one: Superman's origin story and Zod's evil plot.  Zod's plot is intriguing, but it concerns me how similar his plot is to the plot of Transformers 3 (turn Earth into a planet for themselves).  As far as Superman's origin story, there are as many good things about it as there are bad.  The moments of Clark Kent as an adolescent are great and very true to the Superman motif, but they are scattered throughout the movie.  Some of them fit well (Clark sees a bus and it reminds him of the time he saved a sinking bus) and others are just random (Clark saves men on an oil rig and thinks of when he first developed his powers).  And as far as Superman's no-kill rule (which I didn't even know was a thing until the internet exploded), I understand it's a big deal, but the way I see it, Superman can't have the rule until he has a reason to, and now he does.

It's also worth mentioning that they really play up the Christ allegory in this film.  It's blatantly obvious.  I'm not saying it's a bad thing because it's well-done and Superman fits the mold well, but it does feel a bit like the exploitation of religion.

Additionally, the action in this film is good, but starts to get a bit repetitive (just a lot of punching and flying).  And it's hard to follow all of these fast-moving Kryptonians, but it's realistic, so I'll buy it.  And the musical score for this movie is great.  Hans Zimmer really outdid himself.  It's nothing like the classic John Williams score, but it is just as good.

The cast in this film is phenomenal.  I had never heard of Henry Cavill before this movie, but he made quite an impression.  Not only does he look the part, but Cavill also gives us a noble, altruistic do-gooder, just the way Superman should be.  He even delivers many of his lines in ""hero voice"", which only further contributes to his owning the role.  Amy Adams (who I've always enjoyed) gives us a Lois Lane that is both tough and funny, though I don't buy the chemistry between her and Cavill.  Michael Shannon as General Zod gives us a portrayal of the character that is very true to comics, with a very strong devotion to Krypton and its people.  Russell Crowe's performance as Superman's father Jor-El is great, and I wish there was more of him in this film.  And Kevin Costner, who I had high expectations for as Jonathon Kent, does not disappoint, giving us the Pa Kent needed to guide a young Clark Kent.  Costner's performance may have been my favorite of the film.

Though I don't know much about Superman, this movie does a lot of great things to remain true to the comics.  All of Clark's childhood in Smallville and on the farm with Pa Kent are great.  Superman's suit is great (and yes I think it's better without the red tights!).  And the cape is 100% CG, yet you'd never know.  The flying sequences look spectacular with the sonic booms.  There are tons of references to the DC universe, such as LexCorp and Wayne Enterprises.  But best of all is the ending when Clark puts on the glasses and gets a job at The Daily Planet!  I didn't think this franchise would go there, but when it happened, I was all smiles.

For someone who can't stand Superman, Man of Steel did a heck of a job making me a convert.  Though I still don't like the decision to make this film a sci-fi epic, the film is spectacular.  They have given me a Superman that is truly alive, and I can get on board with that.  This reboot is an easy recommend to all, though fans of the Reeve/Donner films may be a little critical of Man of Steel, what with nostalgia and all."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Didn't expect the ending,  but realized it was a revitalization of the golden age introduction to Superman, when he was much less of a boy-scout.  More sci-fi elements gave it a whole new feel.  Refreshing new approach."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,I like how I didn't have to wait for 1/2 the movie for some action.  Having flashbacks during some action was a perfect combo!!
"Nov 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This looks like a (similar) job for Superman! Look, up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Super... Excuse me. For a big budget motion picture remake of perhaps the most recognizable comic book superhero Man of Steel is a tamely run-of-the-mill effort. It is generic blockbuster personified, and is a bleak, characterless, lacklustre, uninspiring, disjointed and overly rigid entry in an intermittent franchise, which ironically struggles to take off. What's the ""S"" stand for? Well in my world it stands for Super-Serious as opposed to Superman. Never before has a superhero been so unwilling to express any discernible passion for their cause, simply maintaining an impassive poker face the whole time. The fate of mankind hangs in the balance, Superman to the rescue! Screams excitement right; however, Zack Snyder has somehow turned this tried and tested premise into a dreary, rather monotonous exploit, even if the visuals and set pieces verge on stunning; more dull and lifeless than dark and gritty. Henry Cavill is cool, calm and collected as Superman; however, he comes across overly reserved and emotionless far too often. Cavills' steely resolve is rarely visibly tested even if the goings-on impart otherwise, rendering his portrayal of Superman a tad difficult to adhere to on a humanistic level. In addition to this, he appears sound in the fabled suit but his rendering of the celebrated superhero comes across too deliberate and noticeably premeditated, although he does find his feet towards the end when the movie is given a much-needed shot of adrenaline. Man of Steel lacks fluidity, it is apportioned with often brisk and abrupt scene changes, and provides an unkempt collation and abstract composition of extracts and gestures to scenes from other movies. It is also complacent on character introduction, being naive in thinking we all know about the characters enough to not have to shed too much light on them; notably a lackadaisical introduction to Lois Lane and her backstory, further marred by a romance kindled out of thin air. All in all, Man of Steel supplies a moderately attention-grabbing experience, albeit unhurried and void of any palpable sentiment. In addition, it does not break any new ground and sets an overstatedly grim-faced tone that future installments in the notoriously up-and-down series that has experienced its fair share of highs and lows in the past will have to address if they are to garner the widespread approval of the audience.

Maybe somebody should have gave Superman's cape a tug and told him you're doing it wrong.

"Nov 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I went into this movie with an ope
n mind knowing it would not be the superman I know but something new. I feel Zack Snyder understands that these are all well established characters that people know from tv, previous movies, and comics and he doesn't need to develop all these characters entirely because it is a reboot and he wanted something new and I applaud you on that sir."
"Nov 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I'm not going to say I'm head over heels for this reboot, but I can't deny Snyder pulled it off quite well. Man of Steel reinvents what we know about Superman, changes in which are welcome and improvements, many which will be skeptical to fans, but very little that will piss anyone off I presume. The film is half drama and relationships and the other explosive sci-fi action. Surprisingly, the dramatic bits appealed to me the most, even if they were the slowest parts in the film. It really does well at telling Clark's past and the origin stories associated. I was skeptical about the film's A-list actors but Russell Crowe does well, however Michael Shannon was a bit over the top and I wasn't a big fan of him, but he did okay. Henry Cavill who's been little known for smaller roles up until now is an outstanding choice for the character, with a young and older face that suits the character extremely well. My hiccups with the film was some of its shaky, odd camerawork that sometimes took me out of the scenes cause they're just plain weird or do nothing for the scene whatsoever, and the action borders on a bit of excess that's unnecessary. Yes, prepare for the CG syndrome here guys. It certainly has a slickness to it, but as usual, the filmmakers use that as their excuse to go way over the top and milk lots of visual scramble out that rarely heightens the action but rather overdoes it. A big question that is raised is that whether Superman in this film is really the hero we all know or an anti-hero of destructive means, because a lot of shit gets destroyed in this film. It does and doesn't bother me, that's all I can say. Man of Steel is very much on the lines of other modern superhero films in that it's a serious, emotionally deep and dark approach that is different from what your used to. The fun, campy and silly times of superhero movies are done and its unreasonable to expect these films to have that stature, even if you prefer them that way (I do!), hell that's what the old Superman movies are for. Man of Steel does its own thing and okay."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Great reboot first movie. setus up the franchise well.
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Great! Best Superman movie; second only to Superman The Movie (still my favorite)!
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome movie can't wait for the next one
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"If you wish to know about Superman, and haven't seen the other five. This is the one to start. Henry Cavill was the perfect pick for Superman and Russell Crowe was excellent as Jor-El. The writer's did an excellent job on portraying Clark Kent. I didn't like that Superman killed someone in the end but it was still the best action superhero movie out since The Avengers. When I go to see an action movie, I want too see action, not humor. This movie is an A+."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Very well put together movie. Takes a unique tone on the superman character and gives fans the brawling action they've been yearning for. The action is well balanced with the emotional strands between kal-el and his father.
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Fantastic reimagined update of the Superman mythos! I can't wait for the next installment.
"Nov 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The film is fine. A bit long. And in my audience, tended to produce some real sleep. The film isn't horrible, but it really isn't anything new to add to the Superman saga."
"Nov 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,No John Williams score-complete fail.  Excellent representation of Kansas.
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,BEST SUPERMAN MOVIE BY FAR !!!!!
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Good start on the reboot.  Uh, why would I listen to a critic stating it didn't have enough comedy or romance?"
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is the greatest Superman movie thus far. It has a great storyline, the plot is very unique and the action sequences are amazing. My only issue would be Amy Adams' portrayal of Lois Lane. Other than that this is the best Superman movie."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"It exceeded the entertainment expectation, quite enjoyable."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Best Superman movie ever, i'm looking forward for the sequel."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Amazing! Anyone who loves Superman should love this movie. I see reviews saying ""there's not enough humor or joy"". Okay...they weren't really going for a comic-book feel-good movie here. They were doing much like the Nolan Batman trilogy--bringing it closer to reality. Kal-El's struggle to become the hero he was born to be and decisions that will eventually mold him into Earth's greatest and most beloved hero. Admittedly I had an issue with the final Sups/Zod ending, because that just doesn't seem like the Superman we've read about for decades. But, with a more real-world storyline to this film than you'll see in the comics..it really sets the pace for how Clark learns to become the hero he's meant to be. Every decision he makes will make its mark on the hero that will be, and this decision at the end of the film might simply be the one that gives him his resolve and outlook on how he handles super-villains from now on. That's about the only way I can think to put it without posting spoilers...so there ya go. Great film, can't wait for sequels to come."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie for modern times!!!
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie I have ever seen! Loved how they gave more back story on Krypton and Superman's parents.
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Best movie ever. All superhero movies are the best!
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I loved it.  This movie was a refreshing change to Superman's campy past.  I was surprised to hear so many negative reviews and wondered if I saw a different movie than those who didn't enjoy it.  I also thought it funny that so many compared this to the Christopher Reeve version where he fought General Zod and said Superman would never kill.  Did anyone besides me notice that in Superman II, Superman turned the General and his two goons into humans and then tossed them into a frozen abyss and didn't think twice about it?  
This movie was fun, exciting, and a great set up for the sequel.  Can't wait for Superman/Batman."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome best movie mad so far
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Best superman ever made!
"Nov 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A bit overrated, but it is a worthy re-interpretation of the character and it finally gets some seriousness to the concept. Perhaps a little too much seriousness. Still, Snyder and Nolan are actually quite incompatible, as Snyder seems to focus more on shaky cam and CGI. Overall, the worst thing about this movie will be its sequel, which will feature Batman. Why not let Superman get his own trilogy before making Justice League?"
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Great way to modernize this classic franchise.  A ton of action!
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel was a great film to watch. It gave Superman a new feeling of realism. This is how it would happen if Superman was real. I loved how the plot focused so much on how people reacted to "" aliens walking among them."" The only problem I have is when Superman killed General Zod. It seemed to me that the last words exchanged between General Zod and Superman were a little too cliche (cheesy?)Besides that, I really enjoyed Man of Steel"
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,pretty much just all boom and crash
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,FREAKIN' AWESOME!!!!!
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I absolutely LOVED this MOVIE!! It showed to realism in Kent's life. Many want to see the original version of SM but that's all blah. I truly love this movie in the fact that it shows what it means to be an outcast. This is the best and most realistic Superman to date. I was so happy that it wasn't filled with tons of fun and romance and jokes...but it showed the ""growth"" of Kent into Superman. He didn't pop out as Superman overnight. Loved it! Go Superman!!!"
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,its a nice update to the superman icon
"Nov 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,Disappointing to say the least
"Nov 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It was ok. Not what it could have been, but ok."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"My hat is off to Zack Snyder.Ive seen all the superman movies,No disrespect to Christopher Reeve.Because no one and I mean no one will ever take his place.But this is by far the best Superman Movie made,next to Chris Reeves first movie.Henry Cavill has a long way to go,before being a icon.Hate they changed the hair....."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,One of the best SuperMan movies of all time! Period!
"Nov 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The biggest question going into ""Man of Steel,"" is whether or not Christopher Nolan can bring the same down-to-Earth psychology to Superman that he did to Batman.  The quick answer: not entirely.  Yes, he and director Zack Snyder have created a well-mounted action picture - they get the fight scenes just right - but in trying to deal with the deep scars of Superman's origins, they have put together a movie that is choppy and disorganized.

The movie opens on the Planet Krypton where Superman's father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) is dealing with two problems at the same time.  First, his planet is dying and no one will listen.  Second, Krypton's military leader General Zod (Michael Shannon) has organized a coup against the planet's elders and intends to overthrow them.  As you already know, Jor-El's plan is to send his son, named Kal-El, to Earth where he will be safe.  Zod, who learns of his plan, vows revenge.  These scenes work well in a functional sort of way.  Krypton looks appropriately apocalyptic and the movie establishes some information (unspoiled here) about little Kal-El that we haven't seen before.

Then for the next hour, or so, the movie becomes a chaotic, disorganized mess.  Scenes of Superman's origins as a child are intercut with scenes of Superman as an adult so that we never feel Superman's journey from infancy to adulthood.  One minute he's an adult working as a crab fisherman, and the next minute he's a little boy saving kids on a school bus.  We never get the great homages to Americana we did in the 1978 film. We don't get scenes of Clark's Kansas upbringing where he discovers his powers. Most of the scenes in ""Man of Steel"" are so hurried that you feel as if you are just watchng highlights rather than a complete narrative.  The movie is in such a hurry to move things along that we never feel that we're getting to know the man of steel.  Diane Lane and Kevin Costner play his Earth parents who dispatch home-spun advice, but they pop up here and there almost as cameos.

Much of the movie suffers from attention deficit disorder. There's hardly a scene in this movie that doesn't contain a special effect and anytime two people come close to having a conversation, the movie hurries past it so we can get to an action scene. There's wall-to-wall action here, but the characters get lost in the shuffle.

The third act of the movie, when Superman and Zod square off is where the movie picks up.  Zod, now a Kryptonian prisoner, wants to turn the Earth into a new version of Krypton at the expense of the population already residing there.  That idea comes to life mostly due in part to the performance of Michael Shannon.  Shannon is one of our best and most intense actors - check him out sometime in the great ""Take Shelter.""  Here he brings General Zod down to Earth, so to speak.  He wants a planet to rule but there's nothing flashy or erudite about his personality.  Shannon plays the role pretty close to the bone and that's appropriate.

British actor Henry Cavill in the title role has a great screen presence, but as you watch him, you sense that he will grow into the role if given another chance.  He's not given a lot to say. And his relationship with Lois Lane?  What relationship?  Her role (played by Amy Adams) is to be a nosy journalist, follow her leads and smoke out the indentity of Superman, but there is nothing resembling a romance here.  Except for one chaste kiss, they almost seem like just good buddies.  There is a suggestion that their love affair is being held over for the sequel, but why not deal with it here?

Of course, the standard for the man of steel lies is Richard Donner's 1978 classic with Christopher Reeve.  That film was a beautiful four act play, laying out Superman's origins from Krypton to Smallville to Metropolis and to his adventure in California. There's very little joy here, no grandeur of the discovery of Superman. Why couldn't the movie have had the tone and the mystery and the emotional impact of that beautiful trailer that came out last summer. That should have been the tone of this movie. It works in fits and starts but it needed a lot of work."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great movie! The only thing that slightly threw me off was Lois lane. However, in general it was worth my time. :)"
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES YET
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this different take on Superman. Well done!
"Nov 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,Not for Superman fans. Maybe for some new kids.
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Very enjoyable film. The overall story was a good one. Didn't quite cared for how it ended but given the way the story unfolded I am willing to accept it.
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Hasn't been a Superman movie this legendary since Christopher Reeve put on the cape!!!
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,It was a great movie.  I liked it better than the rest of the Superman movies.
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Super sick! Henry is so HOT and did such a good job!
"Nov 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I have to say Henry Cavill is a good Superman but the writers killed this movie for him.  Krypton looks crazy.  With vast technology I don't know why Russell Crowd is riding around on a dragon or whatever that was in the beginning.  I thought I was watching Avatar or Star Wars for a second.  Then the scene jumping of Clark going from job to job and skipping back and forward from past as a kid and present was confusing and unneeded. Why not just go with chronological order?  The fight scenes were way over done, everything was at 100 mph.  I seen him fly gracefully one time.  The conversation with Clark and his dad and the transition to Superman was nothing just short and simple.  I was like he has always wanted to know about his real parents and where he come from and when he sees his dad he just chats with him a bit and that's it.  I hate the part where the military always has to be after the hero.  and the part that took the cake for me was at the end when there was a flashback of Clark's earth dad watching him play outside with a red cape and acting like Superman.  So how is Superman playing Superman when he was little.  He hasn't been Superman yet.  Also Lois knows Clark is Superman through the movie even calls him Clark, so Shes always going to know Clark is Superman.  That's goofy.  Give Henry Cavill a good Superman movie please.  that was sad.  No one else can be Superman like Christopher Reeve, but Henry is perfect for Superman now."
"Nov 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,Decent action sequences but the rest of the film was far too dull for its own good.
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"this movie was awesome down to the very tiniest detail, action packed and keeps you wanting more"
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I'll still give it a five star, but there was a lull in the middle of the movie. Other than that great change of Kripton and how powers differ due to our climate."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,I enjoy the new story line and got to see that Superman may not be the only one left
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel gave us a great deal of excitement. it introduced new elements never before seen in a Superman movie. Overall, it was better than any other Superman movie that I have seen before."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,The special effects and all star cast get the 5 stars
"Nov 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,Worst super hero film of a worst super hero. Thumbs down
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Great Movie!Must Have To Your Collection!!
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Best revamp of a series ever
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Amazing! A little overkill towards the end but well worth watching.
"Nov 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It has very well filmed action scenes, and an excellent score. I just wish it went deeper into Supermans character."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Way better than Superman Returns
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Super is man of steel!!!
"Nov 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,Didn't like how they kept flipping back and forth between him being grown and a kid..but was great other then that.
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,So much better special effects compared to the original!  It was due for a remake!  Writer Christopher Nolan pulls it off again with Man of Steel!
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,I think this was the best superman movie yet. I am very surprised critics gave this movie such low ratings. I can't wait to see the next man of steel movie!!!
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,The BEST SUPERMAN movie ever made. √∞???
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Many of the complaints I see regarding this film tend to be easily rectified by simply paying attention to the film's subtleties. No, it may not be the Superman film you wrote in your own mind, or how you think Superman ""ought to be"", but the movie is excellent, and well worth at least one viewing."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Fast-paced and lots of action, not for the weak!"
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Yes, all the building smashing in the last half hour was idiotic, but everything up to that point was magical. The pacing, Kal El's gentleness, the religious motifs, the design, the actors... so many separate elements that complemented each other wonderfully. Please release a Director's Cut that removes the final third and this movie would be great."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"LOVED it. Saw it opening day. Had to own it for sure, now I do. Can't wait for Superman vs. Batman. I'll own that also."
"Nov 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man Of Steel delivers, The Superman Movie  I've been waiting for a long time, entertaining and epic."
"Nov 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,"gotta be honest i wasnt that impressed. I kept hoping a subtler story could have been told. Did Zac snyder not learn anything from Chris Nolan's Batman Begins? There were some awesome ideas there underneath the surface, ideas of evolution, genocide, genetic perfection, communism, fate, but they all get swept under the rug for an impersonal explosion of non invested action. What a waste of time and money."
"Nov 13, 2013",POSITIVE,best superman movie yet!!!
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Badass, finally a good movie for superman"
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,AWESOME MOVIE SAW IT ON THE FIRST DAY IT CAME OUT IN THEATERS AND BOUGHT IT TODAY WHEN IT WAS RELEASED
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Cavil is Superman. Loved every minute!!
"Nov 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"As a giant Superman, I was a bit disappointed, but still an awesome film..First the good..Spoilers

-Great Action, killer action scenes (no pun intended), and what has been missing in a Superman film.

-Russell Crowe is awesome, he almost steals the movie.

-Cavill is Superman, a humble an emotional performance, he is talented no matter what honest trailers says. A bit more dialogue, but we should see that in Superman v. Batman.

-The entire cast is great and hold the film, another scene stealer I'd say was the woman who played Faroea, she was intense and hot, like I want my future wife to be.

-the ""Smallville"" Easter eggs..there was three people who were in the show Smallville, can you find them? Also a reference here and there..

-Krypton is pretty badass and a lot of work went into a pretend planet.

-""I WILL FIND HIM!""

-The using of real troops and real military equipment, a real way to thank a troop, put him in a Superman movie.

-all of the dcu Easter eggs..Wayne Enterprises, LexCorp so on and so fourth..

THE BAD

-What's the point of the Codex?

-where the f is Jimmy Olsen?

-Why go back for an f n dog when you're a football field away for a tornado that is moving your way.

-Crazy amounts of destruction, a bit too much.

-No after scene credit

-Too little humor

-Too dark, Batman is dark, Superman is the opposite.

-Why even think that Zod is someone to trust?! ask your ghost dad!

-The killing of Zod, a lazy way out, if Supes is gonna kill em, make it cool! This better be the reason he doesn't kill in the future..

-not enough saving of civilians.

All and all enjoyable and fun, but it seemed to take it's self too seriously as a movie, I say for the next film, lighten up, just don't make it campy and brighten up Superman a bit, he isn't a mope..It's the Superman movie we deserved, but not the one we needed.."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Por supuesto que Henry Cavill as SUPERMAN 5 Estrellas!!!
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"ANYONE who says this movie sucks, is nothing but a self righteous grouch... THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME!!!! and i dont even like super man that much, i am more of a hulk guy, but honestly i thought this movie was awesome..."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,BEST MOVIE OF 2013!!!
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Superman never looked better on screen
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Best reboot E.V.E.R and decimation of human life serves as catalyst for the tension to be seen in its sequel bout with the Dark Knight himself
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"havent seen it yet but from what I hear, awesome. I love batman!"
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"I really liked this movie, it could've been a little better but it was still great. I don't know why it has such a low rating."
"Nov 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyable, but far to much explosion and not enough character and story. Still, Zach Snyder is the man!"
"Nov 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Boring dialog, boring fights.  They didn't do anything with the Daily Planet team to make us care.  We didn't get to hang out with Superman and see who he was, instead we got a bunch of taped-together flashbacks about stuff he did.  The best parts weren't with Superman, they were with his dad.  Make a movie about him instead."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,One that surprised me for hero movies one of my favs for the genre have to say well scripted and casted for the movie. This superman will leave you wanting more!!!!!
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Was surprised I enjoyed so much.
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,This is the best Superman movie I have seen. It has lived up to my expectations.
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,some of the story line has been changed but overall a good reboot
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Although it gets a bit overly sentimental and almost gets away with itself with its soap-box sayings, it changes the origin story enough to keep it interesting and provides the action sequences sorely missing from every film in the franchise so far. The movie tries a bit too hard to humanize Superman, but there are a few successes and it doesn't take away from the pacing when it fails. Definitely worth watching."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,tha best superman movie ever.
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,I give this movie two thumbs up
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman ever.  Sorry C.R. you are a close second.  :-D
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder make this classic story their own.
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Really good and we'll done movie
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Everyone I see or know puts this movie down but wat u dnt realize is this is not the superman u came to knw this is man of steel the grittier take on superman christopher nolan esque type of dc movie wich is awesome yea superman causes destruction but nobody complained when he was a cartoon on saturday mornings fighting villians tearing thru buildings and leveling streets when he would get slammed upon the streets I love this movie it takes me back to the cartoon n wat man with god like powers wouldn't destroy things when he's fighting opposers destruction is inevitable in that case but dnt take my word for it that its amazing see for urself a new vision for a new era
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Not bad for the umpteenth reboot. Give me a storyline already aside from how it started. Let's kill Superman finally, then bring him back - GO Doomsday!"
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,A great new reboot of Superman. A darker version from the norm. This is what I have been waiting for from DC!
"Nov 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Part Matrix, part Star Wars, part Riddick, part Star Trek, part Wolverine, part Sunday school lesson, part crap, I was heavily invested in the story until the fighting began, and then it seemed like the movie should be over, only it dragged on for an hour more."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"This almost ended up a 0 star just having Kevin Costner appear, however his quick death allowed me to keep watching. Definitely not the traditional Superman story. Pretty darn good considering. The special effects and flip side of it made it unique. I liked it a lot. It was good to see Zod... Haven't seen him since the original Superman with Reeves. Or was it Superman 2...I don't remember... Anyways, it's action packed and worth a watch. Lois was disappointing.. She should have been hot, this actress was mediocre looking.. Come on people, Superman deserves a hottie!"
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"IT's been my favorite movie of this year. It wasn't perfect. I could have gone without Space Jesus and a few other very minor annoyances, but ultimately I love this new Superman."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,The best Kripton sequence by far!
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,The Superman movie I (we) have waited for!'
"Nov 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,"If you're a sucker for comic book films like me, then you'll find the single most reason to buy the dvd - dope a$$ action scenes."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,So intence !!!!!!!!!!
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"""Man of Steel"" as good as it's gonna get.  This is a reboot, yes it is. Why re-invent the whole story line when everybody know who or what ""Superman"" is. This movie I think show the real POWER of Superman, although it seem that he is slow to control it. But that is what we need to see the POWER of Superman."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,I thought the movie gave more insight into The Man of Steel's persona......Loved it!
"Nov 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"solid movie, does the frachise justice,action packed and fun to wathch"
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"This was the best superman movie I have ever seen.  It sets up the DC movie universe in a way that pays tribute to the comics but doesn't just blatantly copy them.  Setting up Superman as an alien as part of an alien invasion was a cool way to start the universe up.  

Even though its nit the superman of the 70's or even the golden age, it is a good take on the character that fits in todays world, and the impossible choices he had to make are the foundations of his basic philosophy of protecting all life.  He will be the shining light of superheroes, but he will have to earn it more than just being given the role."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Action and fun explaining the back story well
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,This Movie is (beeping) awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Loved it. Nice to see a good look at the new age of superman
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,The Man of Steel movie was really great but the thing that got me me and my neighbors was that Superman doesn't really kill people
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Was this movie excellent or a ground shattering success? No and no.  What it was, and sufficiently managed in, was a Superman movie that finally laid groundwork for a franchise to be excited about.  Similar to Nolan's first foray into the Batman realm, 'Batman Begins,' this movie serves a purpose to lay groundwork for a vision I can see partially taking shape.  In a grand scheme, this movie will be viewed as an exposition to a larger story being told, and, as such, suffered from some limitations on how deep the plot lines could venture as well as balancing the amount of background required while still being a great stand alone movie.  All in all, I feel mission accomplished in making a movie I was and am excited to watch while promising big things on the horizon for a beloved hero."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Best ever man of steel.
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,While this isn't the prefect superman movie it does one thing that all movies should. It leaves you wanting more.
"Nov 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,Have fun and become tedious.
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Pretty freakin awesome!!
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Great reboot. Few plot holes but they might be filled in with the sequels.
"Nov 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The action wasn't worth much, but the introduction and suspense in between was thoroughly enjoyable."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Had everything I was hoping for and then some.
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Zack did an awesome job. What a great interpretation of one of the most famous comic stories ever told. loved it from beginning to end.
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Absolutely love it!! He's the man!!
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,amazing truly  epic movie !!
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,a very different but welcome take on the Superman story.
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"anyone who doesn't enjoy this film is cynical, nostalgic, or just plain wrong and incapable of discerning the subtle intricacies of this amazing telling of our greatest hero's origins!"
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Excellent remake. It is super!
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is not the Superman that we grew up with and loved as a kid...... This is something new, and has been forced into this position after living a life or hiding. He was not in training for 20 years. From this you can see that this movie was solid as a film, and the story is expanded through his failure."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Been a fan of superman sense I was 5. I have comics dating back to the 40's and there is not much I don't know about The Man of steel. This take on the story is fantastic! Can't wait to see more.
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Delivered entertainment, awesome visual effects and some great performances. The music score was also epic. Not sure why this movie gets so much hate, I loved it. And yes, I loved Donner's film too. That one had flaws as well, yet people tend to overlook those."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Best superhero movie I have witnessed! Great look at how Superman came to be. Best Superman film by far.
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"In comparison to the original, and then the train wrecks after it, this one has greatly improved the genre.   
I loved it!!!!"
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great Movie, finally Superman has been done justice"
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,The superman we've all been waiting for! He kicks ass and takes names!
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,had alot of fights but i lovesd them. It made up for the lack of battles on Superman |Returns.
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,freakin best movie ever
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Again, I don't understand these haters who hate all around fun movies. 
I thought this movie was amaze-ballz Unicorn-Tits across the board. I even teared up in one section. I highly recommend u check this one out as it's the Best SuperMan movie to date. √∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???"
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Good new beginning for the Superman franchise.
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,The movie delivers on the promise
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Roar!!! Never listen to critics who can't see how impressive this film really is!!
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Safe to say this is a masterpiece that takes superhero films to a new level. Amazing action, incredible story and fantastic acting. I have to also say this would be enjoined but non comic fans too. If you love good movies that just so happens to have a man that can fly in them. Man of Steel is for you. One of the best superhero films ever made."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Excellent film. Excellent flow for story. Excellent acting.
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"I never understood the hate that some brought to this movie. I've always loved Superman and truly appreciated this ""new spin"" on his tale. Henry Cavill's portrayal was terrific and Michael Shannon as Zod was perfect. He was a calculated maniac. Russell Crowe as Jor-El was outstanding and poignant."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Loved this movie! Superman is back baby!!!!
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"The superman movie I've been waiting for.  A different movie from what has already been done.
They already have Superman returns and complained about it, now we have this and they complain about it.  The superman with lots of humor and romance exists in the other superman movies.  Those are still there for others."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie is Great!!  F all you haters!!!!
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,This is the best superman movie to date!! The opening scene was great and the action never stopped!
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Since Nolan is involved in this, people will compare it to the Dark Knight Trilogy, which is thoroughly unfair.  Zack Snyder knows how to make an entertaining film.  I was impressed with the down-to-earth approach, the focus on Superman's humanity (assuming he's human of course).  The movie would've been better with Nolan directing, but it's still great.  The soundtrack makes it even more compelling.  Loved it!"
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,exceptional  film! bravo zack! after that peace of crap called superman returns. (shivers) man of steel redifines the superhero genere giving it its pretty colors and many action scenes. although not strong on the story it delivers what the people want.. and thats  our MAN OF STEEL!  super hero movies arent built to get oscars or built with solids stories because its an adaption to a comic book. Exceptional acting from henry cavill our Clark Kent!  must watch film! excited for JUSTICE LEAGUE !! AND MAN OF STEEL 2 OR AS WE COMIC BOOK NERDS CALL IT... BATMAN VS SUPERMAN!!!
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Not only was ""Man of Steel"" one of the best movies of 2013, but has great special effects and good acting. Henry Cavill was great as Clark Kent/Superman."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Best movie ever! The Worlds most epic movie is here!!
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie well done!
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"The Superman movie I have been waiting for as a Superman fan, Amazing, truly amazing.."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,A strong emotional ride that meshes a Dark Knight like realism with the traditional Superman we all know and love.
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Not as amazing as it should have been...

Don't think about it too much, and it's a great movie."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great reboot, even though it lacked some emotion  the film came through with a great script and action"
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"The most accurate & true mythos created on screen for Superman in my opinion, & one of the best superhero movies ever made."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome!  Great Movie!  The critics are just assholes!
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,I love to watch Superman movies <3
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Love watching a darker, lonelier Clark Kent"
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Best movie this year!
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Esta pelicula viene a reivindicar todo el concepto de Superman (con mayusculas). Mucha accion y mejor historia de Nolan que de verdad no deja de sorprender con todo lo que hace.
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Aside from Lois Lane finding out who Superman was WAY earlier than she did in the comic book series this was a pretty good movie.
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Excellent update of original story. the core values etc are still there, but several things were brought up to todays technological standard that todays modern technological society expects to see. this is a superman as if he came here today. don't go in with expectations just relax and enjoy the ride."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,I can not be objective! I am a FAN!
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"This superman movie was well improved. Although I was not wowed, still movie I tuned myself into the action good work."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Man of Steel was everything that I was expecting it to be and more. I love this honest and modern interpretation of the Superman story. Glad I have this in my collection right next to me Matrix shrine.
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"It was a good movie as far as the rough edges, superman man has been why too gentle or soft in Supermans past. If you see in from the comics he does have dark story lines, so stop with the whining that there wasn't enough comedy or a love story. Here's a question in Man of Steel Zod dies by having his neck broken to the 26th power and if you go back to Superman II Zod dies by falling into the mist of the fortress of solitude in which we don't even know that Zod dies. Which would you rather have the mist or the broken neck? Geeez come on!"
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Love the movie. However, I Hate the disastrous fight scene. Its juz too Un-Superman. Furthermore, no matter how chaotic it seems to be, Louis Lane will find Superman."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"I still don't understand why critics panned this movie. I have seen all the original movies with Christopher Reeve, but honestly none of these older movies live up to this latest rendition. no depth in story? everything truly had a place and reasoedn in this version: Superman wasn't just some normal kryptonian kid sent here, he was an accidental ambassador of his lost race. The fortress of solitude wasn't just some place in Alaska made of icicles that superman hung out in; it was an ancient spacecraft of his civilization. Finally, General Zod wasn't just bad to be bad; he actually thought he was a good guy! Much much more dynamic and plausible plot that was well thought out. Haters, stop comparing this to the originals."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Good movie, just a little long."
"Nov 12, 2013",POSITIVE,I liked the movie however as a comic fan a few flaws and re imaginings through me off.
"Oct 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Probably it was one of the most anticipated movies before it went out. But unfortunately Nolan's name doesn't matter here the film has its flaws. The 1st half of it is actually the good and interesting part, the part where I hoped and waited to the characters to grow. But they did not have the time because the action and the explosions took their place till the end of the movie, and it's too bad. It's seems that the creators of this film were afraid that the crowd will run away if it will be too serious so they decided the 2nd half of it will be more action instead, actually the effect is exactly what they did not want, the 2nd half is Boring and spare, and it seems like someone else took the writing pen."
"Oct 8, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Man of steel was one of the worst movies ever to be in theaters, it was boring way to long and the plot had so many holes it was impossible to look past, The movie is ok if you want to watch a simple movie with very cheesy dialogue and some ok. special effects"
"Oct 8, 2013",NEGATIVE,"A noticeable effort to make an creative Superman plot, but the ""creativity"" is too far fetched. Is this still Superman? The 50's comic, a sexist love story, is no longer to be found. Superman doesn't save the common man, he's not a public figure, he's no longer a reporter. What the hell is going on???? Not a must see, more likely a must avoid."
"Oct 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,Lots of explosions... Poor Smallville
"Oct 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The first half, maybe even 2/3, of this film is brilliant and breathtaking.  Then it just becomes ridiculously destructive and silly. Too bad."
"Oct 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,"that movie had extreme action and it was a little too intense for your eyes. it didn't require a plot. it just needed a way to setup superman's new career as a superhero and at the daily planet. it made a perfect job of that. although, I didn't like how the movie looked into clark's past with flashbacks. in conclusion, it had plenty of action and adventure and enough investigation into superman's past."
"Oct 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,"One of the most controversial movies of the year for sure. Man of Steel is directed by Zack Snyder and stars Henry Cavill as Superman in a reboot of the Superman franchise. This film has divided fans and critics alike. Some say it's the Superman film we deserve, some are saying it was trash. I'm just as divided, so let's dive right into Man of Steel.

The film starts with the destruction of Krypton and Kal-El's mother and father rushing to save him. This is one of the best things about this film. It's both emotional and thrilling, even driving me to teary eyes at one point. I loved this section of the film, as did most who saw this film, even the naysayers. Then comes Earth. Kal's childhood is told mostly though flashback which is both one of the film's strengths and weaknesses. This helps us to learn more about Kal, while still propelling the central plot forward, problem is it's central plot is weak, so it feels rather messy. But it's an origin story, so I wont be too much hard ass about the plot. Most of the flashbacks are really good, albeit a tad cliche and sentimental, it still got the point across-- Kal had a troubled childhood. The story is bland, but it's an origin story, I didn't expect much of a story going in. 

Henry Cavill makes a good Superman, he handles the emotional scenes well and is convincing during the action scenes. Amy Adams is decent as Lois Lane, it's not that she's bad or anything, it's the material she was given that was bad. ""If we are done measuring dicks...can you show me what you found?"". Give me a break. Kevin Costner is great, he plays his role perfectly, as does Diane Lane. Michael Shannon is good, but not as good as he usually is sadly, which is because he's not given much to work with. The cast overall is fine, nobody really stands out, but no one is completely horrible either. 


The directing is fine by Zack Snyder, nothing great, but he does a great job with the action, but feels a bit less assured when it comes to the more emotional aspects of the film. The writing is pretty weak, alot of the comedic lines are cringe-worthy and much of the emotion is sappy, but there are some truly great lines to be had. The cinematography is wonderful, we get many shots that are absolutely dazzling. The editing is good, if a bit choppy during some of the action sequences. The special effects are great, smoothly blending live action and CGI, even if the CGI is overused at times. The sound design is pretty great, no complaints here. The music is superb, Hans Zimmer once again creates a phenomenal score and main theme. Technically this film is superb, not surprising considering it's hefty budget of reportedly $225,000,000. 

I was initially skeptical when I heard that Zack Snyder was directing Man of Steel, but the trailers were incredible, so I walked in with huge expectations, which was rather dumb of me. I left the theater disappointed, but now after seeing this film again knowing what I was in for, I enjoyed it alot. It's a big, fun action movie that while not as good as the trailers promised, was still a good time. Many say this film has too much action and not enough story. This is a completely valid complaint, as the action undoubtedly surpasses the amount of story in the film. I enjoyed the action though and thought that it had just enough story to satisfy me. Many people say that Henry Cavill is a bad Superman. I disagree. Superman was too much of a boy scout in the Christopher Reeves films, but too much of a baby in Superman Returns, I think they did a fine job of finding a good mix of both that felt perfect for Supes, he was troubled, but still heroic. 

OVERALL: Man of Steel is a flawed, but fun superhero flick that thrills, but is lacking in the story and dialogue department.

FINAL SCORE: 7/10"
"Oct 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,"While things could have gone a lot worse in Zac Snyder's hands, this film misses the essential attraction of Superman by giving us an alien orphan with superpowers and daddy issues rather than an inspiring distillation of all the good we find in ourselves (coupled with superpowers). Perhaps in future installments we'll see this is a coming-of-age story for the super-Boy Scout we find elsewhere. Until then, Henry Cavill will be the sad Superman among all those actors whose are largely remembered for wearing a smile along with the red cape."
"Oct 7, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Trying to distance itself from ""Superman Returns"" and makes too many of the same mistakes."
"Oct 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The only good thing about this movie was that Hans Zimmer was responsible for the soundtrack. Tried to cover too much in too little time, especially due to the repetitive extremely long, and after a while, dull battle scenes"
"Oct 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,"dull, seriously dull.  it's all dramatic build up and then ridiculous fight sequences."
"Oct 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"It has a way different feel from the original movies, but Man Of Steel still is still a fantastic Superman movie due to the great casting and exhilarating action sequences."
"Oct 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"I waited for this film, in agony, for over twenty years. IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT! It could not have been better."
"Oct 6, 2013",POSITIVE,Loved the background story to how Krypton got destroyed. Loved the action sequences and the general story line. Some parts of it were boring while other parts made me scratch my head... eg.. What the heck was his earth dad thinking????  Good movie though.
"Oct 6, 2013",POSITIVE,Drfrdrdrdrddrdrdrdrrrrffggvgvtgvfwvfyxigtytsaatwywysteysddhs
"Oct 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,Liked the movie but it was too long
"Oct 5, 2013",POSITIVE,A Superman film that escapes the stigma of it's heritage. Not without problems but with a wealth of great ideas and solid execution.
"Oct 5, 2013",POSITIVE,This is the superman movie that we the fans need.
"Oct 5, 2013",POSITIVE,"Just finished watching ""Man Of Steel"". That was awesome! Wish I had seen it in the theater!

It's not the comic book Superman, but it is an interesting and enjoyable take! If you look at it like an alternative world affair, it's very enjoyable.

And Laurence Fishburne makes a great Perry White! And the fight scenes are mind-blowing!"
"Oct 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Good picture of CHRIST !!
"Oct 4, 2013",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this movie as a superman fan
"Oct 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,Anti-climatic from beginning to end
"Oct 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man Of Steel, is great."
"Oct 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,"It had all the right elements and the perfect cast, but they still managed to turn it into a live action video-game for teenage boys. This was the most disappointment I've ever felt after a movie. The only thing that didn't disappoint was Hans Zimmer's score."
"Oct 4, 2013",POSITIVE,I'm not the biggest superman fan but this film was an excellent adaptation and finally a superman that looks a little like Christopher Reeve!!
"Oct 4, 2013",POSITIVE,i have no idea why the ratings are so low on this movie. it was action packed story filled and the best superman film to ever be realeased in 30 freakin years!!!
"Oct 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Love this movie especially with my 3D Blu-ray version copy, this movie is excellent, Super or shall I say SUPERB! I don't care what critics say about how bad this movie is to me, this movie was worth the long wait and now that A versus movie is in play to those who don't know in the cartoon the Darknight Returns 1 and 2 and also World's Finest will be a MAN OF STEEL 2. You tell me but when I see the sequel to this movie, will be added to my Digital Collection that I PROMISE, until then D.C. and Marvel Universe! ;-)"
"Oct 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"One of my top 5 favorite movies, easily. It has everything to offer, excitement, thrill, and a great story!"
"Oct 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,Good story just needs more depth in the characters.
"Oct 3, 2013",POSITIVE,Everything I wanted and more!
"Oct 3, 2013",POSITIVE,WHAT ELSE DO PEOPLE WANT IN A SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER ? This was a fun movie to watch.As soon as it was over I wanted to stay seated and see this again. I haven't felt this way since Star Wars whe it first came out in 1977.
"Oct 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"This has to be my favorite movie of the year. Even though Superman is the main character, I think the performances from Russell Crowe as Jor-El and Michael Shannon as Zod, really stood out and are my favorite actors and characters in the film. It is a more mature and down to earth Superman story, while some people would not like it, and would argue that some of the things that Superman inadvertently causes (the extreme collateral damage caused in the final act of the film) are out of character, I feel that this works for this kind of character in a modern age. The special effects and CG are beautiful, and the action scenes are amazing, showing you what it would be like if Kryptonians fought against each other. I loved this movie, so much so that I saw it in theaters 3 times!"
"Oct 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,"My opinion of this film changes everytime I see it. This film tried to tell the origin of Superman in a very different way then other versions of the character. I liked the monologues Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe gave to Henry Cavill's Superman, it's just told in a very jumbled way and in the end, it doesn't make us care for Superman or even know who he is. I cared about Peter Parker, I cared about Tony Stark and I cared about Bruce Wayne. I can't say the same about Clark Kent. The structure of this film is very strange as well. Most films have a three-act structure, this feels like two. First is all the expostional set-up and the second is a CGI orgasm on screen. I will admit that some of the action set-pieces are pretty awesome but some don't look the best, especially when watching it at home. Overall, I'm glad I saw Man Of Steel but it will not be in any of my ""Favourite Movie"" lists anytime soon."
"Oct 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I feel cheated because the fight scenes take up so much time, yet the punches and smashes seem to have no effect upon either combatants"
"Oct 1, 2013",POSITIVE,"awesome reboot, i really love the father role in this....good call casting kevin costner just the right match and its great that they elaborated on his history a little bit more. The original superman was great for that generation but the ""Man of Steel"" Truly sets the standard for the type of films derived from comic book superheroes. Anyone who would give this movie a bad review , is just a negative nancy lol."
"Oct 1, 2013",NEUTRAL,muestra peleas muy r√≠tmicas y una trama comprensible pero a pesar de eso no se desprende ni supera ala trilog√≠a de batman
"Oct 1, 2013",POSITIVE,It is as good as any other Superman movie.  They will continue to 'revive' and 'try again' no mater if the last was good enough or not.  We'll be back again for the next round.
"Oct 1, 2013",NEGATIVE,Superman in church asking for guidance !!! What a stupidity. Unbifrackingleavable !
"Oct 1, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Even for a superhero movie, the plot holes, lapses in logic, and contradictions are staggering.  Many defend this darker, grittier Superman as the hero for our Post 9/11 times.  If thats the case then we've allowed the actions of a terrorist to diminish our expectations for a character who was always an inspiring beacon of hope.  If you want gritty, dark realism, Batman serves it up is spades and looks good doing it.  But don't drag Superman through the mud!"
"Oct 1, 2013",NEUTRAL,People gave it jipp but I liked it. Henry Cavill - HOT!
"Oct 1, 2013",NEUTRAL,It was a good movie.
"Sep 30, 2013",POSITIVE,I loved the action and pace.  Fun in 3D.  Well acted.  Dark for a Superman movie.
"Sep 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Well what a surprise this turned out to be.  After the disaster that was Superman Returns it was quite conceivable that Clark Kent would get mothballed.  Not so.  Nolan's influence is quite apparent as the story does edge into slightly darker territory but with Snyder directing it takes a more ballistic approach to it's events.  
Jor-El(Crowe) dispatches his new born son Kal-El(Cavill) to Earth just before the destruction of their home planet, Krypton.  Although sharing Jor-El's vision of Krypton's fate General Zod(Shannon) attempts a coo to seize power.  This fails, Zod is imprisoned and Krypton's future lies with Kal-El.
So the battle is set up on Earth as Kal-El takes on Zod and his cohorts.  This is all amazing to watch and the pace is relentless.  The effects steam at you to intense levels, quite reminiscint of The Matrix at times.
What lets the film down for me is the period between the intense opening sequences upon Krypton and the final battles on Earth.  Clark's story growing up is told in a really disjointed fashion mainly using flashbacks.  So it didn't really give a progressive sense of his journey to manhood.  This is a shame because Kevin Costner delivers a nice performance as his adoptive Father.
Cast-wise it's a good show from all but nobody lives up to their predecessors.  Shannon is great as Zod but he has a tough act to follow from Terence Stamp.  Crowe, again, offers a nice take on Jor-El but as with Zod he suffers from the fact he follows Brando.  Cavill is adequate shall we say and Adams as Lois Lane, well, her character had nothing to work with really and she just made up the numbers.
We all know about the Batman infusion the sequel will have but with the pace of this outing it's hard to see how he will keep up, just being an ordinary human being in a batsuit!
Bright & pacy, Man Of Steel is a loud, sometimes brutal, well executed blockbuster."
"Sep 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Ok movie. I was a bit disappointed. I expected over the top great, but out was mediocre at best"
"Sep 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Entertaining, but nothing else.
The substance was cheesy at points.
Just an okay film to me."
"Sep 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,"It was ok.  For a 2.5 hour movie, it skimps on story for over the top action and in the end it just seemed like it was endless battling.  Some of those sequences were cool, but just too many of them.  Some parts of the story that needed developing were cut short too soon, to the point where it may have not even made sense, but it cuts to action so fast you forget about it.  Jor El's consciousness gets uploaded into ships and the way he appears and waits in every corner made me feel like the end of a Zelda game on N64 where the princess was guiding me through the castle after I beat Gannon.  Somehow, even though Zod and crew were released from the phantom zone at the same time as Kal El was sent to earth, they didn't age 33 years.  The way Zod tried to change earth looked like it came right out of the first Abbrams Star Trek movie, the way Superman was fighting the ship looked like it came from Matrix 3 which also made me wish Perry White would just turn into Morpheus already (since it's Laurence Fishburne).  Too many people know that Clark is ""special"" and i don't know how they can hide the fact that he and Superman are the same person for very long.  The way Jonathan Kent died also did not sit right with me at all."
"Sep 29, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie to watch.
"Sep 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Before judging the Man of Steel, answer the question: do you love Superman? Even if you never admit it, do you believe in what Superman stands for? From that answer depends what part of the flick you will be disappointed for: I like the side Nolanhater reject, the serious, thoughtful relationship between the hero and his divine status, even at the cost of making him less immaculate; if you like Reeve's Superman, you'll reject the taint, while I think that for Man of Steel we had lived better completely without the costume (pants or not). Dicotomy not solved."
"Sep 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"I really loved this darker version of Superman. Sadly, the second one will suck."
"Sep 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,"MOS was a different twist on the Kal-El story, which was good. It was much better than the previous attempted reboot, but General Zod wearing Gears of War armor for the whole movie was a little unnecessary. The only hints we got of Lex Luthor were the Luthorcorp trucks and scenery items, shot between a series of ACTUAL product placement locations."
"Sep 28, 2013",NEGATIVE,"It's better than the last Superman reboot, but that's not saying much. I expect better fight scenes from Zack Snyder. And there's a huge hole in the storyline that I can't get over. Spoiler Alert! How does General Zod, who is born and bred to lead the armies of Krypton, first lose a fight with Krypton's leading scientist, followed by losing to his son who has no military training? It's like Colin Powell getting whooped by Bill Gates and them by his son."
"Sep 28, 2013",POSITIVE,change of story...but still real good!
"Sep 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,best superman movie ever made
"Sep 28, 2013",POSITIVE,"Super!!! With the wisdom given by his two fathers, Kal-el must bridge the divide between two worlds.  Visually stunning with intense action.  Zack Snyder and David S. Goyer have delivered a mature superhero film that shapes the new vision for the cinematic DC Universe."
"Sep 28, 2013",POSITIVE,"I had very high expectations for this movie, and I wasn't disappointed, but I left the theater thinking something was missing. It was cool that it didn't focus on his childhood in Kansas, and for the first time we got to see what krypton was like in vivid detail. I enjoyed the movie overall, but to put Ben affleck as Batman in the next (Justice league) movie is ridiculous. I know Christian Bale is loyal to Director Christopher Nolan, but to punish us with Ben? WTF?"
"Sep 28, 2013",POSITIVE,"this is what superman returns should have been, fans should adore it"
"Sep 28, 2013",POSITIVE,Good reset. Interesting to see the rest
"Sep 27, 2013",POSITIVE,"The motion picture spectacle of the summer regardless what all the naysayers have generated.  Snyder and Cavill pump new life into the most iconic superhero of all time with a NOT OVERLY DARK take on the man of steel.  Stellar cast, breath taking action, and a smooth paced 2 and a half hour spectacle that will undoubtedly spawn a sequel explaining the lack of regard for human life in the finale to finally shut all the haters up.  Cavill gives us a modern Superman, embodying all the things Superman should be without resorting to camp or Iron Man esque antics.  An amazing score from Hans Zimmer enhances the venture as well as Snyder's ability to tell an origin story that rarely feels ""seen it before."" In addition to that the film makers take a lot of ballsy chances to keep the audience on it's toes.   Undoubtedly a pot boiler in many ways for fans that I for one welcome and can't wait to see where they take it, even though I think I already have a good idea."
"Sep 27, 2013",POSITIVE,finally a great superman movie! :D
"Sep 27, 2013",NEUTRAL,"C'est la 1√®re fois que j'aime le personnage de Superman; dans tous les pr√©c√©dents films, je l'ai toujours trouv√© trop lopette. Mais bon, le film qui vient avec est moyen selon moi. J'ai l'impression que √ßa veut trop ressembl√© √† du Marvel, avec Thor dans ce cas-ci principalement."
"Sep 27, 2013",NEGATIVE,This movie is a steaming pile of shit.
"Sep 26, 2013",NEUTRAL,Superman is back finally they managed to make a superman film that doesn't suck can't wait for superman vs batman in sequel
"Sep 26, 2013",POSITIVE,A great super hero movie with a few issues- Zod was a cardboard character and the love story was nonexistent- Avengers had much better dialogue but a worst plot- (who were those cannon fodder aliens on jet/snow skis?)

"Sep 24, 2013",POSITIVE,awesome best superman movie of all time.
"Sep 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,Great casting for the title role... not much else positive going for this movie. What promised to be so much produced so little. Could Zack Snyder be the new M Night Shaymalanananan?
"Sep 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,It's missing a lot of humour. Entertaining film though.
"Sep 23, 2013",POSITIVE,I loved it!! Henry Cavill made for a perfect Superman!

"Sep 22, 2013",POSITIVE,Nice adaptation of a old story. Well done!
"Sep 22, 2013",POSITIVE,I want to see over and over and over. This is the best movie of this year.
"Sep 22, 2013",POSITIVE,"Best Superman by leaps, bounds and speeding bullets. There is genuine heart beating inside this superhero. Sacrifice, honor, compassion and courage eclipse the standard gravity defying tricks. Let's hope this same ""heart"" beats in all the expected sequels to come."
"Sep 22, 2013",NEGATIVE,Just saw it and am still wondering why its called Superman. There is not much of superman in here .In a nutshell its a mess. The movie drags along through most of the first half on destruction of Kropton and some fancy thing called codex. There after you could see a little of superman flying around or rather tossed around by a alian General in the name of some fancy codex. Lois Lane has been shown using filthy language right from the beginning. Certainly not for children as its too violent and certainly not for adults unless you  want to take an asprin right after watching it. I am a hardcore superman fan since my childhood and just hope we see the next one made by Brian Singer....
"Sep 22, 2013",POSITIVE,loved the new.superman.awesome

superman returns sucked ass"

"Sep 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,"As 'Man of Steel 'progresses, audience remain captivated but get a queer-y feel watching Clark communicate with the preserved conscience of his late father Jor-El and to learn through his father's holographic message his origins, the extinction of his race and his allotted mission that of bringing hope and succour to the human race.

"Sep 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"While it's no Superman I by Donner, Zack Snyder is up to the task of developing an engaging Superman movie. I will say I love all the movie but the end. I was disappointed that while trying to modernize Supes he broke the one rule he would never break. He is known as a ""boyscout"" for a reason. Other then that kudos!"
"Sep 21, 2013",POSITIVE,I like how it has a Si-Fi feel to it.
"Sep 21, 2013",POSITIVE,The best SUPERMAN movie ever made and one of the best comic hero movies ever created!
"Sep 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,It was ok wasn't great
"Sep 20, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I am a big superman fan.   I was terribly disappointed.  Despite the big names, the script was so poorly written that nothing could save this movie."
"Sep 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It seems like it is time to reboot the Superman franchise. The Christopher Reeve series has plenty of charm, but it seems dated when you revisit it now. There are a several changes for this new series, some of which are good while others seem like heresy. The movie looks great! Finally Superman gets the special effects he deserves. The battle scenes are impressive and showcase the superhero's speed and strength. Unfortunately the movie lacks discipline in the editing room and overloads the movie with action sequences that drag on. These action scenes look great but they lose their effectiveness when they go on for so long. The decision to embellish the heroe's back-story on planet Krypton was an excellent one. We get a better look at what Kyrpton is like and it also lays the groundwork for a well-constructed villain. I really like Russell Crowe as Jor-El, Superman's father. Unfortunately the movie skimps on Clark Kent's upbringing with his earth family. There is a lot of lost opportunity by glossing over his childhood and teenage years in a series of flashbacks. The most interesting part of Superman is not what he can do. It is about him coming to understand this planet and his place within it. The cast is good, but somehow it lacks that certain magic I was hoping for as we rediscover to the classic characters. Most of all I was extremely disappointed to see that Louis Lane discovers the identity of Superman! With Louis knowing the difference between Clark Kent and Superman, the new series will not have that emotional conflict of an implied love triangle. It is fun and entertaining, but Superman should more than this."
"Sep 20, 2013",POSITIVE,The movie was long and real good action. Stayed interested to the end.

(I just wanted to check this out)

This review is going to be full of spoilers because I am going to mention various gaping plot inconsistencies and outright idiocies in this dog of a film.Sure, it looks great and the special effects are generally well done. But some people need their movies to at least make some sense.Let's start with a really basic one: the planet Krypton is going to be destroyed, and no one can be saved except one baby, presumably because they don't have any spacecraft. Oh but wait, they do have spacecraft. In fact, they have so much spare technology they use it to send criminals into space... so that they will survive and provide enemies for Superman later in the movie.

Jor-El steals the Codex, which apparently contains the DNA of the Kryptonian race. Somehow, there are no backup copies. Oh but what about the actual Kryptonians who are running around destroying things... surely they each have their own DNA? Apparently not, somehow. And how about that baby-making machine in the scout ship: what was it supposed to use if there's only one Codex? Clark just happens to hear about some top secret ice digging, and somehow knows to go there. How? And Lois Lane is somehow given a tour of the dig and a free place to stay even though she had to sue to be allowed there at all.

Clark discovers the spacecraft and somehow knows how to pilot it and land it somewhere. But then it never gets used again, for example to help fight the invaders later on. Doesn't it have the same kind of engine that's needed to destroy them? And it actually can fly rather than needing to be dropped via an airplane, as Clark's baby spacecraft is at the end of the film. But somehow no one thinks of this. When Clark is taken to General Zod's ship, he loses his powers because he supposedly needs the gasses in earth's atmosphere to gain and retain his powers. Yet he's shown repeatedly operating in the vacuum of space. If he needed Earth's atmosphere to retain his powers, he should lose them in space.

In numerous fight scenes, massive damage is caused to probably inhabited buildings, which must have resulted in massive loss of life. Why wouldn't Clark/Superman immediately lure his enemies far away from the city, fight over the ocean, in the mountains, etc? In one scene he deliberately throws an enemy through a bunch of buildings, apparently not caring who gets hurt.

At the end, when the world engine is working, Superman flies into its gravity beam where his powers shouldn't exist because the conditions it's creating are like those of Krypton. But after being unable to do anything, he somehow just decides he's going to do it, and then instantly destroys the machine. Because if you really really decide, then you can do anything. General Zod's ship will be flipped back into the Phantom Zone if its drive field comes in contact with another drive field of the same type, as found in Clark's baby spacecraft. But wait, don't all their small spacecraft use the same engine? Why don't they cause the same problem?

At the end, Superman and General Zod have an extended fight and appear to be equally matched, but when Zod threatens a prototypical family of Father, Mother and Child with his heat vision (and which he somehow doesn't manage to hurt although all he'd have to do is move his eyes slightly), Superman easily kills him, although he was completely unable to damage him until then. Again, just deciding to do something makes it happen.

Well it's apparent that the only reason for this film was to make money. The ONLY reason. Sears, IHOP, 7-ELeven, and U-Haul logos are shoved into your face during one of the ""climactic"" action scenes. And I mean you could see the washing machines at Sears. It was that bad. Beyond that those action scenes were just smashing scenes. Smashing buildings, smashing cars, smashing asphalt. The Hulk would have gotten sick of all the smashing. Just debris everywhere for a good half an hour. It literally made me tired. And the effects looked bad. People are tolerating this in movies lately for some reason but nothing about Superman flying or the explosions or the debris looked real. I don't understand how in 2013 the effects are looking faker/worse but they are. I guess to the video game crowd it doesn't matter, but my eyes want to believe what they're seeing even if it's a fantastical story.

This is a movie that didn't bother to make any sense, and the fact that people accept all the illogical plot holes and dumbness of it really pisses me off. Special effects shouldn't be enough to make a movie popular. The story and the logic of the story should count for at least as much and more.  That's why films with little to no CGI typically turn out better than those with it.  They don't rely on the computer animations.  They focus on the script (sometimes) and acting.  Sorry, Zack Snyder, but you are a terrible director, whose only decent film was Watchmen.  David S. Goyer, writer of the Dark Knight trilogy and many of those stupid horror films and Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, is as guilty as Snyder.  Overall, don't waste your time with this.  2/10"
"Sep 19, 2013",POSITIVE,"Better than last. no ""kneel before Zod"". But that's fine with me."
"Sep 19, 2013",POSITIVE,"I'm shocked at Rotten Tomato's rating for this film. It's not that bad! I mean, yeah, it wasn't perfect, but come on! It wasn't that bad!"
"Sep 19, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Okay,I'm not the biggest Superman fan, but I have made it a point in my life to watch all the Superman movies, and this was the least enjoyable. I never respected Superman Returns till now, at least that movie had characters and a plot, not Superman punching things for an hour, which sounds awesome but is incredibly boring. Heck, I'd rather watch Superman IV, Supergirl, or Steel then this money pit: because I can actually enjoy those because they'e bad in a runway, this was bad in a ""I just want to die way"". Honestly one of the worst movies I've seen this year"
"Sep 19, 2013",POSITIVE,Great original story Krypton looks amazing and is a great action packed movie ! Best since the first one !!!
"Sep 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Best One Ever!!!!!!!
"Sep 17, 2013",POSITIVE,The Superman movie I was waiting for many years. Even if it not has all the Superman elements it is a really well made and excels in what it brings to the story. A great film.
"Sep 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,too much action cuts
"Sep 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Worst, Superman, ever!
The moral of the film was non-existent, it honestly felt more like an incomplete biography than a story.
It was boring, real boring. There was way to much detail, and the action scenes were just stupidly long, they were really more about quantity than quality. Really, before watching this movie I never thought that people being thrown through buildings could ever be so non-stimulating!
But the worse part, IS THAT WAS NOT SUPERMAN! What that was, was Christopher Nolan's Batman in a non-colourful superman suit, with no charisma at all! He's not the all powerful nice guy Samaritan, he's just a guy with some demons fighting in him, who don't know who he is.
The only positive things I can say about this movie was the casting and depiction of General Zod was very good, the way Superman gets his suit is much better than the traditional story, and I liked that when he broke the sound barrier he created sonic booms, it made it feel more realistic. But other then that, it was just shit!"
"Sep 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,Glad I didn't spend too much time and money watching this drivel.
"Sep 17, 2013",POSITIVE,I actually liked this remake
"Sep 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Would be a 5 for me if it didn't have Amy Adams as Lois Lane.
"Sep 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Apesar de ter mais caracter√≠sticas de Nolan que de Snyder sem ter nenhuma assinatura, o filme tem atrativos de sobra para nos segurar por 2h30 na poltrona."
"Sep 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie. special effects were awesome.
"Sep 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I really wanted to like this, and I did but it has some serious problems. The main one, and possibly the only one is simply pacing. This thing is long and moves slower than dirt. The first section is way, WAY too long and too talkative for anyone's taste. The next section (lets call it the first half of the middle section) feature no Superman so who cares (that said, it isn't bad, it just isn't overly fast paced), the next section is and frankly is the best part before the way too long, not talky enough ending. All action and no substance, and it just keeps going and going... and then it keeps going. Does it set-up the mythology well? Very much so. Does it look good? In Zach Snyder's  gritty way, it does (in my opinion the look, the mis-en-scene is the best part). Is it well cast and acted? Yes, in my opinion, but there has been criticism and I can see why. Amy Adams easily drifts into Giselle mode, Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner are somewhat annoying and Diane Lane was costumed so poorly. It may be the 90s, but denim overalls are still a sin. Michael Shannon works but he's still Michael Shannon and he's doing what Michael Shannon does which doesn't quite work. Henry Cavill works but he wears too many Henley shirts. The film had, and in many ways still does have a lot of potential. I loved what they did and want to see where this goes. But it needs work. I also saw it in 3D and while not necessary, works well, which in this day and age is a big deal."
"Sep 16, 2013",POSITIVE,A highly entertaining flick. Perhaps not quite living up to its expectations but certainly a worthy blockbuster cinema experience. Henry Cavill fits superman's cape nicely but perhaps the highlight for me is Russell crowe as Jor-El
"Sep 16, 2013",POSITIVE,it was a good movie didn't think it would end like that. But i can see why its a must see for any superman fan.
"Sep 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,many un foreseen event happens that superman would never do. examples include lois un every superman cartooon and movie lois doesn't figurr out wjo clark is until after they meet at the bugel. also his people Where supose to be locked up forever unlike the movie man of the steal. man of steal is trying to change superman which can't be done superman is tge original man of steal is like the baby that doesn't know It's place.
"Sep 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"I am a superman fan! I don't read the comics, but have seen quite a few visual renditions.  I enjoyed the movies with Christopher Reeve and remember watching Lois & Clark.  Smallville was my favorite series telling Superman's childhood on Earth.  Nothing, though, compares to Man of Steel. Henry Cavill made a wonderful Clark Kent. I liked the story and look forward to seeing more of this franchise."
"Sep 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,I thinks it has some cheesy actors but it was the action superman we were waiting to see
"Sep 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"BOoM! POw!! PUncH!!! PUNCH PUNCH!!!!
EEXXPLOSIONS!!!!!!!!   ..............................
........SUPERMAN!!!"
"Sep 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Man Of Steel was an awesome movie. Fuck You Rotten Tomatoes.
"Sep 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Loved it!! Great acting, great actors, great remake!"
"Sep 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Vary emotional pulls you in close. Then rips you apart hoping for a way out . Giving way to violence just to come back and beat it down. Well done to be different. As close to reality as sci_fi could be.
"Sep 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Very very very good!!!!
"Sep 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The trailers for this film were some of the best I've ever seen, I was all aboard the hype-train and I think that's why I disliked it the first time around. I actually like it now that I've seen it a second time. The beginning of the film is incredible, it has amazing action and powerful drama. Everything on Krypton was perfection. Then we get to Earth. When the pre-Superman stuff kicks in it feels very cliched and a tad rushed, he seemed to turn into Superman in no time. This is where the film stumbles a bit, but around the second act it picks up and is a really fun and emotional start to the DC Cinematic Universe. Alot of people said that the action felt bloated, I thought so to the first time around, but this time it flowed much better for me and worked fine. The acting was great from everyone except Amy Adams, which sucked because shes usually a great actress. Here she is given terrible dialogue and delivers it even worse. I hated her character. Henry Cavill is a great Superman, at times he can be a bit bland, but overall I thought he did a really good job. Michael Shannon is pretty good as Zod, but not as good as I would have liked him to be. The story is simple, but I'm fine with that because it's an origin story. The action was great, adding neat camera tricks and great visual effects that really make it pop, even if it feels a little bloated sometimes. The score was fantastic, Hans Zimmer delivers again. The cinematography is great, as is the editing. The directing this time around is alot crisper, especially compared to Zack Snyder's other films (I liked Watchmen, but boy was it's story convoluted). 
Overall: I really enjoyed Man of Steel and plan on buying it on Blu-Ray. 
Final Verdict: 7.5/10"
"Sep 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,starts out well. good story building. last half kills it with crazy over the top action.
"Sep 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"For a superhero movie this is one of the best Zack Synder did a fantastic job at bringing back superman to the big screen with a realistic feel. Henry Cavil's superman is the best of the franchise and he shows it in this movie the time spent on krypton I loved during the beginning of the film and I loved all of the flash back sequences with Kal-el as a child. I only had a couple of probelms with the film the first being Lois lane, Amy Adams did fine but it felt like more of a side plot that really didn't matter to me it felt forced and the second was the villain, again Micheal Shannon did a great job but General Zodd has been done so many times and this time he didnt feel very intimidating. Overall this movie is a great start to the new series and as a origin story and to compare it to batman begins I found this film to be slightly better."
"Sep 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,havnt seen it hope its good!!!!
"Sep 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"BORING! Bad character development, repetitive action scenes, and a near mute ""super man"". This movie had a weird pace and didn't explain as much as I thought it would. Where's kryptonite when you need it?"
"Sep 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,Disappointment all around..
"Sep 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Great storyline and told the whole Superman story over again
"Sep 15, 2013",POSITIVE,a promising start for the potential of a justice league movie
"Sep 15, 2013",POSITIVE,a superman movie that lives up to the hype. epic and triumphant.
"Sep 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,Liked so much of it until the end. The unnecessarily long fight scene left me dissepointed
"Sep 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,Not what I expected. Not very compelling.
"Sep 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"So one night my dad decided he wanted to go see a movie. The only movie worth watching that was out in our opinion was Man of Steel. My mom and sisters weren't interested so my dad and I had a guys night out to the movies! Now, this is my first Superman movie that I've seen but my dad has seen other Superman movies so he probably was one step ahead of me. I read the list if actors in this movie and my dad said those were all good actors and they all were! It's just a fact, everyone did a good job in this film! I liked the special effects to make Krypton feel real and Clark's flying ability and laser vision and all of that good stuff. Henry Cavill played a realistic Suoerman, however the man who played General Zod wasn't the best villain. They could have found someone better to play the part. I like how they revealed Superman's life in a flashback. The action and fighting in this movie was enjoyable but some was just way too much and way too long! I felt like all I was watching was Superman and Zod throwing each other into building for like... 45 minutes! My dad literally started to doze off because some battle scenes were too lengthy! The dialogue in this film was believable and clever. I like how Amy Adams in this movie is kinda sassy when she's talking to these rude men. That was pretty funny! Overall, this was a good and enjoyable movie!"
"Sep 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie and a whole lot of action throughout even to the end!
"Sep 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,Pesima pelicula.Escenas de accion con solo golpes y mas golpes. No puedo creer que haiga gente estupida que crea que es la mejor pelicula de Superman .
"Sep 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,Superman made the movie ;)!
"Sep 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Disaster film all around.  Disastrous script writing, disastrous soundtrack, disastrous unchecked carnage display.  A painful unparalleled waste of creative resources.  A Super destruction focused, barrage of Super messy, misguided Super fails.  It's all been done, it's all been done better, and with the lack of hero and unending destruction of this Super character, it's obvious his life here is to destroy any sense of humanity rather than protect it.  Nothing charming, witty, fun or human here, just a dead end nightmare of grossly mismanaged possibility."
"Sep 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,Hectic and disjointed. Superman killed more than he saved...
"Sep 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Henry Cavill is delicious!
"Sep 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,"""In this film Superman punches a bunch of energy while Metropolis is destroyed and all of it's citizens die.""     My 7 yr old was falling asleep... I was falling asleep.  This is a big 2h23m piece of crap; it's weird, depressing, disturbing, etc (these sound like they could be good things... They are not.)  This, the latest failure at making a modern Superman film) is mostly boring, dumb, loud and flashy and it is appropriate that the title lacks the name ""Superman"" because there is nothing 'super' about this film except the budget and all the CGI that money, 7 11 & IHOP can buy.  Unfortunately for Warner Bros and all the Supes fans, it wasn't enough to buy a good movie.          check these out for more  -  1)  Half in the Bag Episode 55: Man of Steel:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4u-HLm8maE          2)  Man of Steel -- Metropolis Will Probably Never Be Able to Rebuild:  http://www.cracked.com/article_15416_6-horrible-aftermaths-implied-by-movies-with-happy-endings.html#ixzz2acEOxIG0          Yes, this is nerdy fanboy 'rage,' but seriously, who doesn't want a good Superman movie?"
"Sep 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"The fact that it was filmed on a hand held camera with actual film makes the experience has a really ""cinematic feeling"" which is so great."
"Sep 13, 2013",POSITIVE,well made great reboot different and unique. superman is no longer a pussy he finally kills someone.
"Sep 13, 2013",POSITIVE,Love it!!!! Can't go wrong with Superman!!
"Sep 13, 2013",POSITIVE,Meilleur Superman ! Jusqu'√É¬† maintenant
"Sep 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"Banyak yg bilang film ini ga punya plot yg terbangun dengan baik. Buat ane, siapa peduli. Bisa melihat superman benar2 menghajar musuhnya sudah lebih dari memuaskan. Walaupun begitu belum masuk kategori klasik."
"Sep 13, 2013",POSITIVE,The darker side to the story of Superman made it one best Superman movies yet!
"Sep 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is the Superman movie that we have been waiting for since day 1, 10/10"
"Sep 12, 2013",POSITIVE,I love superman. and this was a lot better than the first one.
"Sep 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie played it safe and stayed close to the story most of us are familiar with. The only thing missing was the quote ""Kneel before Zod"". I thoroughly enjoyed Man of Steel and I can't wait to add it to my video library."
"Sep 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Almost a perfect movie.
"Sep 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,Superman was just a poser.. graphics not that great at times I felt like I was watching the PS4 version of Superman! Typical plot nothing new..
"Sep 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Finally we can see what Superman can do with his powers. Great explanation of what struggles a young Clark Kent went through growing up which other movies failed to show.
"Sep 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"I don't see what the problem is. Yes, the last third of the film leans a bit toward over-the-top action-packed. But the special effects are excellent and the fact of the matter is that if Superman is fighting other Kryptonians, it's going to make a mess. They did a great job of incorporating classic elements of Superman while giving them a new spin, and the story was solid. Definitely worth a watch."
"Sep 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"the man of steel was a very good movie if youre looking for a prequel to the others that explains how everything happened.  in a sense, it ruined the magic of superman but, as a movie, it was very good. enjoyable as it was, it was a little more science-y than, i think, most viewers expected. 
so, to wrap it all up, it was good, but could have been better."
"Sep 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Just awful. Pure waste of potential. Great casting and seemingly perfect production crew to make this movie. What's more disappointing is that this was produced by Nolan and written by David Goyer, who wrote one of the greatest screenplays ever in the Dark Knight."
"Sep 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Clark must deal with his extra-terrestrial heritage when Zod comes to Earth.

I don't necessarily consider myself a Superman fan so I went to watch this movie with some trepidation. I was pleasantly surprised though. It's a decent and basic enough origin story/reboot to get people interested in this superhero once again without all the nonsense that surrounded some of the earlier, later outings like Superman IV and Superman Returns.

Don't get me wrong, it's a very basic story at its core and some of the performances might not please everyone but to me at least, Cavill did a fairly decent job as Kal-El. There's a lot of back story involving the destruction of Krypton which results in some impressive effects. General Zod is the nemesis in this film who decides to destroy Earth in order to bring Krypton back. The final battle results in major and relentless destruction that again, is impressive on screen.

Hans Zimmer provides a quick paced score to match the film but there's nothing standout about it either.

In any case, I still enjoyed it and look forward to more from the DC world."
"Sep 11, 2013",POSITIVE,Much more serious start to the reboot of Superman. Amy Adams performance was awesome. Needed more upbeatness to give interest to the younger demographic. But still best superhero movie of the year.
"Sep 11, 2013",POSITIVE,"It was a darker version of superman in my opinion, the story was told in a great way. Unlike most superhero movies they don't usually kill the bad guys but superman has the coldness in him. 

It's also awesome to see how much destruction is caused from the end battle and you only see a small quantity of innocence get abolished in most hero flicks but no this movie lets it all hit the floor in style and doesn't hold back.

 I do admit though the story drags on for a bit and when you think the action is over it kick starts again and you feel like there was no need and the movie could have ended on a certain point but they decide to continue the fighting for some reason. 

Oh well this movie was well worth the wait for me. A must see for superhero fans!"
"Sep 11, 2013",NEUTRAL,Watched: 18 Jun 2013
"Sep 11, 2013",NEGATIVE,"One big fight scene. To much noise
Howard"
"Sep 11, 2013",POSITIVE,"One word.
""Masterpiece"""
"Sep 11, 2013",POSITIVE,LOVED IT!!! It made me forget all about the nightmare that was 'Superman Returns' great acting & action!
"Sep 11, 2013",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie!  This is the kind of movie you can wait a whole year to see without seeing anything else and still be rewarded at the end.  Sci-fi tech runs rampant, big action scenes, and Superman as he was meant to be... indestructable!  This movie takes all the holes of Superman's of the past and erases them in a single bound.  I think you're gonna like this movie."
"Sep 11, 2013",NEUTRAL,Like the movie good story line and liked Krypton depiction.
"Sep 11, 2013",POSITIVE,this is one of my favorite superhero movies it was way better than superman returns and made me very happy to watch it and really can't wait for the Batman vs. Superman movie.
"Sep 11, 2013",NEUTRAL,"He is one of the strongest super heroes around but unfortunately no movie could do justice with the role.As far as Zack Snyder goes he has done a commendable job revamping the Super hero,although the action seems overdone .But still he has given super man a new high and the platform for his next in the series...!"
"Sep 10, 2013",POSITIVE,One of the best remakes so far. It's an Irgun film meaning it takes you back to the beginning of how he became Superman!
"Sep 10, 2013",POSITIVE,This should not be rotten. Ridiculous. This is a great movie.
"Sep 10, 2013",NEGATIVE,More like Man of Shi...... But seriously. It had it's moments. Way to much destruction though.
"Sep 10, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Good story, great effects. But to many explosions"
"Sep 10, 2013",POSITIVE,"The best Superman movie ever. That sound like great praise but really, there has never been a good one before in my opinion. This like Batman Begins needs to be made into sequels. The sequel can truly be epic."
"Sep 10, 2013",NEUTRAL,"We enjoyed this very much and found the""new"" Superman very likable. Christopher Reeves is a hard act to follow."
"Sep 10, 2013",NEUTRAL,it was better then the first one they did ok
"Sep 10, 2013",POSITIVE,"Sensational. It will stand up alongside Nolan's batman trilogy (after all it did have his fingerprints all over it) rebooting of the  classic tale done in a clever and engaging way, through flashbacks, great action sequences that were technically seamless. Good cast and plot. Can't wait for the next one"
"Sep 10, 2013",POSITIVE,"They escaped the campy Superman feel of the Reeve era but kept the patriotic ""Norman Rockwell"" parts of Superman. I was surprised at how much I liked it. Zed was awesome."
"Sep 9, 2013",POSITIVE,best movie ever dont listen to all those other losers complain ing about story or love. this is superman not romeo and juliette.
"Sep 9, 2013",POSITIVE,"Though the action might seem a little overkill, it's the first time we get to see what Superman is capable of doing on the big screen. The acting is well done, mostly by Michael Shannon and Russell Crowe; it's one of Cavill's first acting jobs and however a great performance. It might not be the boy-scout Superman we all know and love, but it's a more realistic take on him; it's the way it'd be if it happened nowadays.
The storytelling is very creative, and despite it lacks some character development, there are plenty of things that make that lack worth-it."
"Sep 9, 2013",POSITIVE,Henry cavill good choice for the roll
"Sep 9, 2013",NEUTRAL,Pretty good saw it in theaters on opening day its good
"Sep 9, 2013",POSITIVE,best superman to date.  hope they get better just like the batman series..
"Sep 9, 2013",NEUTRAL,It was ok I expected more saw some weird camera movements that weren't really necessary
"Sep 9, 2013",NEGATIVE,"It's almost as if Snyder and company believe that deepening a universe merely involves making things louder and more special effects laden. The story is full of so many corny cliches that I found myself quite bored. Jor-El's death makes very little sense. All in all, the filmmakers eschewed quality storytelling for bigger, badder explosions. Once the novelty wears off, so does the film itself. This addition to the Superman lineup is so generic in its action choreography that it is the opposite of timeless, quite forgettable, really. Polish does not necessarily translate to excellence, or meaningfulness."
"Sep 9, 2013",NEUTRAL,I thought this was a good portrayal of the superman I grew up with as a boy. loved it in 3D will buy on blueray.
"Sep 9, 2013",NEGATIVE,walked out of the theater twice
"Sep 9, 2013",NEUTRAL,dark like Batman but nice start to rebranding the comic
"Sep 9, 2013",POSITIVE,"SPOLIERS***** AMAZING!! Didnt like that Metropolis was completely obliterated at the end and he KILLED Zod...but other than that, it was awesome!"
"Sep 9, 2013",POSITIVE,amazing movie. for superman fans or not. worth owning and watching multiple times.
"Sep 9, 2013",POSITIVE,Very good. Excellent story. Great actors. The best superman yet. I'd see it again. Very clean.
"Sep 8, 2013",NEGATIVE,"DC's last hope is to bring ""Batman"" IN otherwise no man can save it"
"Sep 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,This movie was over rated. ..
"Sep 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,My and my fam saw in 3d and it was awesome! But the romance wasn't as much as the comics or the older movies.
"Sep 8, 2013",NEGATIVE,"There were parts of this movie that were great.  But unlike Batman that keeps making good versions, Still have not gotten as good a Superman as the Reeves one.  The end actually made me very very upset."
"Sep 8, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie. The actions scenes were great.
"Sep 8, 2013",POSITIVE,Very Good!  So happy that they made a new Superman movie or should a say hopeman!
"Sep 8, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie was everything I had been waiting for to see in Superman
"Sep 8, 2013",NEGATIVE,Jopa Zack Snyderin mittakaavalla tylsyyteen saakka itse√§√§n toistava maailman tuhoaminen (olkoonkin ett√§ komea sellainen) ei pelastu edes Henry Cavillin kohtuullisen karismaattisella nimiroolilla...
"Sep 8, 2013",POSITIVE,"A 100% better then Superman returns, look like a true fan of Superman, Made this movie. great job."
"Sep 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I'm happy to report that this version of the Superman story is very worth seeing. I think what makes this one stand out from the other versions is the story of Krypton and seeing it for yourself. That and the fight scenes. You know they're fake of course, but these were some of the most real looking fake fights I've seen in movies. Now with the bad news.....I'm sorry to say that it's just not what I was expecting. It's definitely no 'Iron Man' but there aren't many movies that can compare as far as entertainment goes. If you're a fan, then it's late show worthy. If not, then just check out the matinee show. As always, I hope this helps!!"
"Sep 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,Missing the iconic Superman theme :-(
"Sep 8, 2013",NEGATIVE,ABURRIDA . SIMPLEMENTE ME DORM√É? .
"Sep 8, 2013",NEGATIVE,ok so its a little better than the previous anemic Supes Returns. but this is not much better. the Lois character ( by the ubiquitous Amy Adams ) is not well drawn. Zod seems as if he has roid rage. And the long Krypton sequence at the opening is unneeded and convoluted. if theres a sequel they to up their game 500 % or even the 2nd run movie wont get my $.
"Sep 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Disappointing, but exhilarating. Man of Steel is very different, but very misunderstood."
"Sep 7, 2013",POSITIVE,Its a way better superman then the other crap out there and i believe chris nolan knows what he is doing rent it but i am going to buy it
"Sep 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,It was pretty good to be a Superman movie
"Sep 7, 2013",POSITIVE,Exceptional. maybe overboard with the destruction of the entire city but great scenes none the less.
"Sep 7, 2013",NEGATIVE,I thought this Superman would be better!
"Sep 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I still enjoy it, even though the flaws really come out on repeated viewings."
"Sep 7, 2013",POSITIVE,"I thought it was great and had nice visuals, Man of Steel is the best superman flick i've seen in years."
"Aug 16, 2013",POSITIVE,I was not impressed but I was not disappointed.
"Aug 16, 2013",POSITIVE,best superman movie ever I loved this movie.
"Aug 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,They went a little crazy on the ridiculous action scenes. The eye candy is very sweet.
"Aug 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,I'm giving this movie a two and a half because of a few reasons... Superman has mostly always been a little cheesy but this movie kinda knocked it out of the park. There are also a few scenes that you sit there yelling at people in the movie because they are being stupid. The beginning was great but for me it just went down hill from there. More extras and other people from the daily plant and so on had more lines than superman. Most of the time he was just looking into the sun and closing his eyes.
"Aug 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A good film, better than I expected and probably the best of the attempts at a Superman movie.  It wasn't as good as other comic book movies of the last year years with Avengers, Iron Man 3 and Dark Knight Rises all being far better than MOS was.

On the plus side the first two acts of the movie were great, good twist on the superman origin story, modernised to take it out of the 50's and really seemed like Krypton was a futuristic alien world.  I also liked Lois' story of tracking Clark down, as unrealistic as ti was that she was that close to the military operations.

Where the story fell down was the final act.  Just like The Avengers, it bothered me.  Superman is supposed to be saving the day and stopping the aliens and he did that while causing billions of $$$ of damage and, what looked like, thousands of deaths.  Multi Story buildings collapsing in the middle of a city street.  The is exactly the same final act as Avengers and it's the one thing that bothered me about that movie and it bothered me again here.  

I look forward to Clark meeting Bruce Wayne in the sequal.  Batman is easily my favourite of the comic book characters brought to screen and I'll be really interested to see what Ben Affleck does with the character (I'm not one of those against the choice, I actually really like Affleck and look forward to it!)"
"Aug 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Very disappointing.
Poor characters, poor storyline & way too much action!"
"Aug 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Real disappointment,..lacks the magic of the Donner classic. Do I believe a man can fly? No, but I believe CGI artists can destroy a city. :("
"Aug 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Real disappointment,..lacks the magic of the Donner classic. Do I believe a man can fly? No, but I believe CGI artists can destroy a city. :("
"Aug 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Some interesting action scenes but the characters don't have enough personality for you to care. Corny as it was, Superman 2 had more emotionally charged action scenes than this.A coical Lex Luthor could have helped."
"Aug 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"I don't get the flack about the movie I liked it. I think the action was great, the story was interesting, the special affects were breathtaking, and the acting was very good especially Henry cavil and russel Crowe. But I have to admit Michael Shannon was kinda underused. Plus even if there are plotholes who cares TDKR had plenty! Overall good movie"
"Aug 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"After waiting for a long time, and a lesson learned about ""no expectations"" refering to 'Superman Returns', I just sat down at the cinema and let the movie do it's thing, and to my surprise, I cried, I laughed, I cursed, I jumped...I just got into the movie and ended up being really thankful for finally seeing a Superman that I beleive it can exist."
"Aug 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Poor version of the original albeit with some excellent performances.  Russell Crow is excellent. They have tried to explain the mystery, the phenomenon that is Superman and explain it away with science.  The city wide destruction was over the top and got old very quickly. It's well cast, well acted and well  scored but uninspiring and over produced."
"Aug 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Wholly disappointing, ""Man of Steel"" is riddled with tone, pacing, and editing issues. The film fails at developing characters properly and effectively, making me not care at all if superman succeeds in his struggle or not. The ""climactic"" fight scene was so excessive that it became excessively dull to the point where I was thinking of the chores I had to do at home. With poor directing that is only one level up from the awful ""Transformers"" series, ""Man of Steel"" leaves one disgruntled and makes ""Superman Returns"" look like a masterpiece."
"Aug 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,It was okay enough to watch it one time
"Aug 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Superman is the base superhero. He is morally incorruptible, always fights for what is right, never has selfish thoughts, is nigh invincible, and the list of his powers is massive. He is the quintessential superhero, but unfortunately, this is hard to capture in film. Superman's film history is full of more misses than hits. The original and the sequel are the only two to really capture Superman and what he is all about, which is not the action and violence of many other heroes, but rather his saving of people, and defeating villains; locking them up, and never killing. DC decided to reboot Superman, giving him a fresh aesthetic and feel; it is a certifiable mess. 

 The decision of both directors and producers were horrible. Zach Snyder, the man behind Watchmen and 300, too k on the directors chair, while Christopher Nolan is listed only as a producer, but acts more like a co-director. Nolan basically re-invented superhero films for the 21st century with his Batman trilogy, opting to forgo the cartoonish nature of superhero movies past, and instead offer mature, adult drama. It was pure genius, and ""The Dark Knight"" is still widely regarded as the best superhero movie ever made. Batman was such a perfect fit for this gritty nature, but Superman is not. This is my first problem with this film: tone. Superman should not aim for any type of realism or PG-13 violence levels. Superman should be kid-friendly (something this movie is not), light-hearted, and fun. I am not saying it should be a shallow cartoon, but it needs to be FUN. ""Man of Steel"" really forgot that element, and gives us a soulless and incredibly boring film. 

 The performances are everywhere on the acting spectrum. Henry Cavill gives a poor performance as Superman himself, lacking almost any charisma or warmth. He was most likely selected for his attractiveness level for girls, and not for acting. Amy Adams, an actress I really love, is just cringe-worthy as Lois Lane. She is boring, and any character is non-existent. There is absolutely no chemistry between Lois and Superman, leading to shoehorned romance scenes. Russell Crowe is actually incredibly enjoyable as Jor-El, giving an overly dramatic, but fun version of him. He is the only one who seems to be having any fun. Michael Shannon, another actor I love, chews the scenery and spits it back out. His performance as General Zod is perfect for a Superman movie, being incredibly over-the-top and ridiculous, but is so shallow and forgettable in a summer of some horrible villains.....now that is bad. 

 The action of the film is even boring. How that happens, I don't know, but this has the worst action sequences I have ever seen in a superhero film. .Continuing a trend established in  ""Transformers"", the big final battle is like 45 minutes long. It has no variety though. It is literally people punching each other into progressively bigger things, and pausing to monologue. It is destruction-porn of the highest order. In addition, the CGI is horrible, making the entire affair look like a crappy videogame.

 The idea of Superman being like Jesus is hammered home again and again, in fact, every single piece of symbolism is hammered into audience's skulls multiple times. We are considered too idiotic to dissect anything, so deeper themes are just as shallow as the rest of this film. And the ending.......oh the ending. The last pathetic attempt to show how ""gritty"" and ""dark"" it had to be, they had Superman kill Zod......by breaking his neck. I do not care what argument you present, having Superman kill is a stupid act. The attempted establishment of why he doesn't kill is a popular one, but it holds no ground. Superman's love for humanity and aversion to violence showcase already a logical basis for no killing, making the final, ultra-violent act of violence insult to injury.

 ""Man of Steel"" is a bigger disappointment to me than ""Prometheus"". At least that film can stand on its own, and is wonderful in its own way. This movie is a sluggish, boring affair that brings shame to the name and symbol of ""Superman""."
"Aug 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie yet! Very well done!
"Aug 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The main fight seen was a little over-the-top, even for Superman. That being said, seeing the emotion and slight dark-side of Clark was a very nice touch. Overall a great and entertaining movie, however I can see how die-hard Superman fans can be disappointed with the changes in lore. I'd say this is a comparable reboot for Superman as the new Star Trek movies were for the original movies."
"Aug 15, 2013",POSITIVE,pretty intresting message if you really do put attention to it
"Aug 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,Typical superhero movie. The dude saves the world they all live happily ever after. BOOORRRIIINNNGGG.
"Aug 15, 2013",POSITIVE,I do agree with some if the critics... but it was a great movie.. it was about time they made him a lil darker..
"Aug 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Excellent addition to the Superman series.
"Aug 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"I don't know why some people didn't like it, I really enjoyed it definitely when it comes to the past superman movies"
"Aug 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,Thought it was alright. I think there was too much destruction. Tons of people had to die. I did like the stuff about Clark growing up. I think he was too powerful.
"Aug 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Flat and boring. I found myself yawning at the action sequences and laughing at parts that weren't meant to be funny. Superman found it too easy to be super, and didn't have many human qualities. He instead was an overbearing, and even creepily nice Kryptonian with a will to save Earth for some obscure reason."
"Aug 15, 2013",POSITIVE,would have gotten 5 stars.but superman never kills...ever.
"Aug 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,Best Superman movie since the 70s
"Aug 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Thank god the campiness has been taken away from all this goofy comic strips of Superman makes more of a serious superman I finally like. The humans who are quirky are not needed. And Louis Lane was horribly cast by Amy Adams who looks ginger every time I see her, but had the character spot on. Bottom line, I replenish all the purist fans hatred in soaking all my strength into liking this flick."
"Aug 15, 2013",POSITIVE,I guess it was a great movie :)
"Aug 15, 2013",POSITIVE,As a huge superman fan I absolutely LOVED this movie
"Aug 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,Not as good as I hoped it would be but it was still pretty good
"Aug 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"I don't get the hate. Man of Steel is quite possibly the film of the year so far. I never thought Superman could be handled in a Dark Knight style but it's worked. Nolan's behind the scene presence is obvious in the story. Snyder once again creates an eye-gasm of visuals and Cavill dons the costume. Most notably though, Michael Shannon as Zod and Russel Crowe as Jor El steal the show"
"Aug 15, 2013",POSITIVE,loved it but who does not like superman
"Aug 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"this is probably the single most underrated movie of the year, everything about it feels epic, it takes itself seriously and asks us,the audience, to do the same. the acting was great by every single actor, the action was incredible, although it's overblown, it's definitely worth seeing, don't listen to the critics. people have been complaining about the fact that it's very dark for superman, but did the trailer suggest otherwise?  also they have recreated krypton beautifully, and Michael Shannon rocks as zod. also I love the fact that they pushed on superman being rejected by the rest of the world, and humans being afraid of what they don't understand etc..."
"Aug 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome remake of Superman loved it a really good super hero movie. It was thrilling and full of action.
"Aug 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of steel has a brilliant cast of actor I can't say that one of them owned the film but most of it is a repeat and predictable and i need something new it's almost like superman 1,2 together but for someone who doesn't know much about superman it's a good movie."
"Aug 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It's nice to see Superman finally achieve a cinematic sense of scale that he's worthy of, even in his story has some awkward pacing issues.  Directed by the ever VFX talented Zack Snyder, Man of Steel takes Superman in an interesting creative direction that I did enjoy seeing.  While not breaking ground, it is a decent starting point.  If ya know what I mean."
"Aug 15, 2013",POSITIVE,It was really cool! Only alittle bit I saw wrong with it!
"Aug 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie!!  Super amounts of action!!  Cant wait for the sequel!
"Aug 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Man of steel best movie of the year
"Aug 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,Action made up for the story. I highly recommend watching it in 3D.
"Aug 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Really good has great action
"Aug 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,It was an alright film. For me I don't like Superman but I feel if you enjoy Superman you will like this movie but it really wasn't my cup of tea.
"Aug 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Just saw it and it was awasome
"Aug 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,Pretty good for a summer superhero blockbuster.
"Aug 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The story itself is great, but an unnecessarily long prologue, over-bloated action sequences and attempts at character development that only half succeed temper the end result."
"Aug 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Superman gets a reboot, just as good as the Dark Knight! maybe a little better."
"Aug 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Outstanding! Great movie!
"Aug 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Mediocre start, middle and ending, nothing to be incredibly syched about...."
"Aug 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie ever!  I was blown away!
"Aug 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Definatly best Superman movie by far,but it wouldn't take much. They did a great job on back story and had solid Antagonist for Superman to fight which was missing in the other movies. I really like watching buildings getting destroyed so so this movie worked for me."
"Aug 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"True, it's not your typical Superman movie, the pacing of the story is strange and costume is different, but I actually like it. It was more realistic in sense of keeping up with today's society and what would be our reactions, as well as making Superman more ""human"" psychologically. When we see an extraterrestrial we would've panic; and when we learn that we were harboring an alien life form we would've been wary of their motives and fearful. Overall I enjoyed it."
"Aug 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Love this movie!! Action packed, and not a dull moment!! Would recommend this movie"
"Aug 14, 2013",POSITIVE,best movie ever this year.
"Aug 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Simply put, AWESOME!"
"Aug 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Fun because it is Superman, but not the best."
"Aug 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,I was so bored by the never ending fight scene
"Aug 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Visually stunning with a handsome Superman. Amy Adams is a great Lois Lane. Some amazing Kryptonian fight sequences.
"Aug 14, 2013",POSITIVE,I am not a superman fan but this movie was awesome.
"Aug 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The first hour, nothing special. The second hour, good. You hear every punch. It's as epic as it can get"
"Aug 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"the movie was the greatest thing to happen to superman. fucking critics are dumb as Fuck. don't get me wrong superman 2 is great, but in man of steel you can finally see superman be super to the max. most ppls complaints are really stupid and come from so called hardcore superman fans. the dumbest complaint is ""there is to much destruction."" Good! it's fucking superman fighting another kryptonian. this isn't dbz where the villain is stupid and agrees to fight at a isolated location so ppl won't get hurt. General zod is true villain.  it's cool superman saves ppl all the time in the other movies, but I was getting tired of superman movies just showing superman stopping volcanos, missiles, natural disasters. anyone who did not like this superman is retreated and probably not a true superman fan."
"Aug 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie must watch
"Aug 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Finally we are seeing real male role models in hero roles, along with Hugh Jackman, go Zack Snyder."
"Aug 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,This is the Superman movie that I have been waiting for. If you grew up with the older films this one may make you sick to your stomach but the film is great. The story in original as a 70 year old story can get. The dark Superman that you get in a few of the comics is finally brought to the big screen. The action is almost non stop but every punch and wrecked building servers a purpose. Do not watch this unless you have a open mind of what Superman can be. It's rare a movie leaves me waiting for the sequel.
"Aug 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Was much better than I thought. Though they tried to be like batman and be much darker n gloomy. It be nice to see superman with more emotion and depth. The CGI was great. It's what dragonball should have been, except his hair didn't move, which Is annoying. I felt like this movie was a set up for JLA & it is, but not before superman vs batman!"
"Aug 13, 2013",POSITIVE,The best superman movie yet
"Aug 13, 2013",POSITIVE,Now this is a Superman movie and man does Metropolis get it's ass kicked. Ohhh spoiler alert!
"Aug 13, 2013",POSITIVE,Answers too many questions loved it!
"Aug 13, 2013",POSITIVE,After seeing the last Superman movie I was not remotely interested in seeing this. This was a highly entertaining film. Not a fan of superman but everything from story to effects was done very well.
"Aug 13, 2013",POSITIVE,Great revisiting of Superman. Very detailed and well done for a serious version.
"Aug 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,Drags on and on and on and on and on And on and on.......
"Aug 13, 2013",POSITIVE,just WOW!! ACTION ACTION AND MORE ACTION...10/10
"Aug 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,Superman as a Godzilla film. Fun action crappy story and bad acting.
"Aug 13, 2013",POSITIVE,I loved it. The cast was amazing! I can't wait for a sequel to be made.
"Aug 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,I love superhero movies. but hollywood can't make a good superman movie and this was no exception. zzzzzzzzzzzzz
"Aug 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,"With a very talented cast, a fantastic director, and big names attached to it like Christopher Nolan, you would expect man of steel to be an epic movie. However, instead of the superman movie we were hoping for, we got man of steel. Terrible writing and boring acting make man of steel the worst dc superhero movie up to date. Aside from green lantern, but I don't even consider that a movie"
"Aug 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel delivers. It does have an insane amount of destruction, and may lack a bit of emotion, but it sets the groundwork for its inevitable sequels."
"Aug 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,"the best superman movie Till now , Great Special Effects , Good Acting But  Not with the strong Screenplay"
"Aug 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"A very moving story of the worlds greatest superhero. The plot was brilliant, the special effects were otherworldy and breathtaking, and an overall experience that will leave you thinking about it for days on end."
"Aug 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"a super hero movie that has the best story line, awesome Visual Effects that will maybe go the academy awards"
"Aug 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"not really into superman,untill i saw this movie"
"Aug 13, 2013",POSITIVE,A fantastic origin story told very well. All the actors do an amazing job. You can fell the connection they all have. The musical score by Hans Zimmer sends chills down your spine on how well it brings the story to life.
"Aug 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,Bad superman movie ever!
"Aug 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Wonderfully shot, stunning visuals that will draw you in and the action is definitely not missing. Man of Steel tries hard to take itself seriously but misses a few beats. It is still a great flick with good performances but not as classic or rewatchable as other Superhero films."
"Aug 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I'm not a huge Superman fan, but this movie was pretty good. I expected more action scenes tho"
"Aug 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie ever!
"Aug 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Man of Steel is much more flawed than films like Pacific Rim or The Wolverine - films I've rated lower. It's issues are deeper and more depressing. Yet I rate Man of Steel higher than those other films because when it soars, it really soars. I really loved the Smallville stuff - the Jon Kent Field of Dreams homilies, the attempt to wedge the idealistic Superman fantasy into a more cynical, contemporary age. I quite enjoyed the Krypton stuff (Marlon Brando never rode a goddamn DRAGON!) but it went on too long - there should've been less Krypton and more stuff of Clark as a kid/teen/young adult - these bits worked really well, but the flashback structure was pretty clumsy, a straight narrative wouldn't have been shameful (nor, to the point would've been John Williams' score). I liked the new Lois - no more clueless ditz, still blindly getting into trouble - to wish for a little more with her. Yet I admire the main theme of the film - Kal El struggling with who he is to be: coward (per Jon Kent), protector of Earth (per Jor El), or (Nolanesque darker) loyal Kryptonian (per Zod). The lensing of the piece is quite interesting - Michael Bay by way of Terrance Malik - the verite style grounds things nicely in the quieter moments. But the noisier moments are far too noisy, far too long, and far too repetitive - particularly the final rumble in Metropolis - I get the whole DC-dark thing - but the destruction in the final reel (with Supes is at least partially responsible for) becomes tedious, unnecessary, depressing. I missed Christopher Reeve a helluva lot, almost as much as JW's theme. But overall I liked Mr. Cavill, and liked what they did here, well enough to look forward to the sequel (until they announced the Supes-Bat pair-up. NO! Too soon!). Oh and Goyer's script might be far from perfect, but his final couple of lines of dialogue are awesome - the equal to those of his in Batman Begins."
"Aug 12, 2013",POSITIVE,was a great movie can't wait for it to be released on bluray
"Aug 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Never a dull moment. Excellent story line! Well done movie!
"Aug 12, 2013",POSITIVE,movie was good...but seemed like it was never ending! Too long.
"Aug 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I think Henry Cavill was great and made the role his own, HOWEVER, it was MUCH TOO LONG!!! TERRIBLE ENDING!"
"Aug 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,I did not like it it was boring I waled out
"Aug 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,Empty relationships and character development all around
"Aug 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Though the film lacks a proper story telling format, steady pacing, and emotional depth, Superman's return to the big screen still manages to offer a fast past, exhilarating re-imagined look at the legendary superhero , and a surprising amount of biblical symbolism."
"Aug 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A lot better then the last superman installment, and a good start for the restart, but he didn't save as many people as you'd think."
"Aug 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Lot's of action and this Superman has some brass unlike some of the other ones, and Louis Lane is strong and hot in this one!"
"Aug 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"MAN OF STEEL is the Superman film us Supernerds have all been hoping for. It's raw, it's gritty, and it's one of the most realistic comic book films ever made."
"Aug 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Was a fun movie and a great remake on the original classic from the 80s...
"Aug 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,oromisjng movie but disappointing...
"Aug 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,Moments of sheer brilliance but ultimately falls flat in the last act. The level of destruction is massive and makes it difficult to ultimately redeem Superman.
"Aug 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Zod and Jor El were cool, other than that, nothing much."
"Aug 9, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This is not your average superhero movie. It was not what I expected, but I can't say I was too disappointed. It is action-packed and yet it didn't 'thrill' me. It was more for grownups than children, which is ironic because children live for superheroes. Henry Cavill is exactly what Superman ought to look like. I do wish that he had added a bit more personality and life to the character. Still it's worth seeing."
"Aug 9, 2013",POSITIVE,"With the storytelling of Christopher Nolan and the art of Zack Snyder, Man of Steel successfully escapes its own Kryptonite; the Sean-Connery-with-Down-Syndrome General Zod."
"Aug 9, 2013",POSITIVE,"Upon first viewing, I thought Man of Steel (2013) was kind of a stinker, but on second viewing I understood the whole appeal: the new suit, the incredibly handsome Henry Cavill as Superman, and the struggles Superman has in being an inhabitant of planet Earth. This movie reminds the audience that he is quite literally an alien, and the film explores his alienation from his early childhood up to the world's misunderstanding as to whether he is friend or foe. The U.S. government in the film, for instance, takes quite a bit of convincing that he really is a swell guy, and still they're ultimately not sure. Extreme Loyalists of the Old Christopher Reeve Guard will likely never budge in their longing for a Superman like their old hero, but really the Reeve films and this new Cavil film are like night and day. If Reeve was old-school jiu jitsu, then Cavill is no-gi."
"Aug 9, 2013",POSITIVE,I loved this movie it was a well made visual feast and tribute to fans of Superman who longed to see the hero done right.  After the last Superman Returns disappointment this is just what was needed to kickstart the franchise.  Christopher Reeve would be proud of this film.
"Aug 9, 2013",NEUTRAL,"WOW, the visual effects were OTT. But with all that computing power why could they not make Kevin Costner less wooden?"
"Aug 8, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I was unimpressed. Firstly, although Cavill looks the part of Superman, his acting was pretty stiff and emotionless. It was hard for me to connect to, or care for his character. I found the action sequences to be, at first, breathtaking--then it just became excessive. I wish that the film had a bit more heart."
"Aug 8, 2013",POSITIVE,A big fan! Was great to finally see his home world in detail.
"Aug 8, 2013",POSITIVE,"An excellent Superman film great story,acting,design,ETC this filn kept me envolved with the story the whole way and most superhero film besides the Dark Knight do that to me so this film was alot of fun the film may drone on in some parts but it's still a great movie."
"Aug 8, 2013",POSITIVE,This is the new generation of Superman. He isn't a boy scout. he is a good person with God like abilities. I felt his struggle. Amazing job making a god feel so human. action sequences are beautiful straight out of the comics. Zod is one of the best villains I have seen for a CBS in a while. In a way you feel for him but then have to realize he wants to kill humans. This is the Superman I wanted and it surpassed my expectations. Beautiful. Epic. Glorious.
"Aug 8, 2013",POSITIVE,"I'm not sure if people were expecting the Superman of old, but this was a fresher approach with an at least comparable villain that made a more believable film than the last Superman foray."
"Aug 8, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Super Man movie ever!!!
"Aug 8, 2013",POSITIVE,I loved the new Superman movie! I think it's one of the best super hero movies done to date. Better than all the xmen & ironman flicks IMO
"Aug 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,Movie was okay. Generic at times. Not much story at times. Not a bad reboot but there could've been much more.
"Aug 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,"As a general movie, this wasn't bad. I love explosions and flame as much as the next teen, but I felt that instead of character development and storyline focus, this movie was only made to see how many buildings Superman and Zod could knock down at once. There wasn't even any true chemistry between Clark and Lois. It may be great for a 'guys night out' or a get together with friends, but don't expect any moving scenes or emotional involvement."
"Aug 8, 2013",POSITIVE,"Brilliant film brilliant superheroes brillant villans 5star is what this needs 

can't wait for the sequal and prequal"
"Aug 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,Gros film zamericain avec plein d effets speciaux pas mauvais mais rien de tres bon niveau histoire...
"Aug 8, 2013",POSITIVE,almost as good as dark knight
"Aug 8, 2013",POSITIVE,if you never knew Supermans history now you do with a twist!!!!
"Aug 8, 2013",POSITIVE,"They finally got it right, almost."
"Aug 8, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome action movie ever!
"Aug 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The best Superman film I've seen so far, though he isn't my favourite superhero anyway.  Very enjoyable film and it was nice to see a different enemy, with Lex Luthor being the only one I've seen before"
"Aug 8, 2013",POSITIVE,The best Superman movie I've seen.
"Aug 8, 2013",NEGATIVE,"this movie was not an inspiration to me, it's too long and it bored me out so this wasn't a very good movie"
"Aug 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Little bit serious and less bit sense of joy, and not memorable theme song, but overall it was Good. They should combine the ingredients in Superman Returns."
"Aug 8, 2013",POSITIVE,Man of Steel was Super.. man! Lol.. Take a look at my non-spoiler review: http://goo.gl/uQqzz
"Aug 8, 2013",POSITIVE,"By far my favorite movie I saw all summer. Great visuals, cool storyline. Can't wait to get this on blu ray :)"
"Aug 8, 2013",POSITIVE,"Really good film, graphics looked wonderful"
"Aug 8, 2013",POSITIVE,"This film doesn't deserve the rotten status it has been given. Some argue that the film is ""too serious"" but as a reboot it isn't exactly meant to take much from the older adaptions of Superman"
"Aug 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,Not as bad as ppl say in my opinion has the batman begins formula (getting to know out superhero) zod is great and so is jur-el. I do hope for better things in the second (like the dark knight) but will be cautious.
"Aug 7, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Superman has never had a better story, visuals, or acting. I could see this as an adaption of the 90's cartoon."
"Aug 7, 2013",NEGATIVE,It was ok. Not what I was expecting. Left me feeling a bit disappointed.
"Aug 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,Very enjoyable. Not very surprising.
"Aug 7, 2013",NEGATIVE,"It seems Superman's true weakness is not kryptonite but a cliched, boring, grim, unpleasant story. Disappointing from start to finish."
"Aug 7, 2013",POSITIVE,Any Superman movie is guaranteed to have huge hype and I have to say that this one was much better than Superman Returns
"Aug 7, 2013",NEGATIVE,"not very well thought out story line. he lets his beloved step-dad die to protect his seceret, but honors that by defying his wishes?  c'mon!"
"Aug 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Pretty good effort by Zack Snyder and Co. Cahill did better than dude in Superman Returns, but that's not saying much.

...still pissed that Affleck is gonna be Batman, though...

#BaleWasBruceWayne..."
"Aug 7, 2013",POSITIVE,"l have so many good things to say but lets just stick with the important things i loved it,it was great."
"Aug 7, 2013",POSITIVE,"AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!!!!!!!!!"
"Aug 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,It was a disappointment
"Aug 7, 2013",NEGATIVE,"If there weren't so many epic super hero movies out recently, this would have seemed outstanding. But the plot depth just doesn't compete with Dark Knight series or The Avengers..."
"Aug 7, 2013",NEGATIVE,"O filme tem momentos Michael Bay a mais, uns espasmos de Terrence Malick e no fim, pouco de Zack Snyder. N√£o era necess√°rio tanto fogo de artif√≠cio. Destaque para a s√≥lida introdu√ß√£o de Krypton, que s√≥ poderia ter sa√≠do do g√©nio de Christopher Nolan. Mesmo a assim, a DC est√° a percorrer caminhos mais s√≥lidos que a Marvel."
"Aug 7, 2013",POSITIVE,as a huge superman fan this is the movie weve been waiting for. love every min of it.
"Aug 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The film feels a bit overlong, especially the first half, and the Krypton scenes. As for the rest of the film, it's (exaggeratingly) explosive! My favorite scenes were the intimate flashbacks of Clark's childhood. Henry Cavill, and even the younger boys, play a great Superman, they fit the role well. Unfortunately I didn't feel the chemistry or love connection between Amy Adams and Henry Cavill/Lois Lane and Superman, which disappointed me."
"Aug 7, 2013",NEGATIVE,The first act is bland and with no action to take a break from the *drama* and the second act is full of fun action... for 20 minutes but with no breaks from the action it gets boring. this movie is dull and boring and you should skip it.
"Aug 7, 2013",POSITIVE,"It was a good movie that went into decent details about more unknown parts of ""superman's"" life. Something about the action seemed to unrealistic even for superman."
"Aug 7, 2013",POSITIVE,Loved it. This is what a superman film is suppose to be. Loved the conflict the main character felt. Everything wasn't so black and white for him. He had some tough choices to make which humanized him which made him finally relatable.
"Aug 7, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Another statement on the inability of Hollywood to let go of a broken franchise and move on to innovative soil. Big, loud, incomprehensible and without real passion. Evidence that the perceived 'winning' formula is just isn't."
"Aug 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,Rubbish!! Too long & boring
"Aug 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,Draaaaaaaaggggggggged. Couldn't wait for it to end.
"Aug 6, 2013",POSITIVE,used to not really give him too much credit. but after this I'm interested to see what comes next
"Aug 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"Pretty nice interpretation of the Superman mythology. Henry Cavil was a  pretty good choice for the role of Superman. Physically he looks like one would envision Superman, but his acting left something to be desired. This movie was a visual treat. I hope the Batman V Superman movie is just as good or better than this."
"Aug 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,it look good but it not my thing sorry man of steel
"Aug 6, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome just as good if not better than the dark knight trilogy
"Aug 6, 2013",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie. Great origin story. Stop being a douchebag critic and enjoy the movie.
"Aug 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,Man of Steel is not as deep as the Dark Knight trilogy but if you are looking for a fun action movie this is for you.
"Aug 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Man of Steel is entertaining and has nice vissuals, but ultimately feels like any generic superhero blockbuster."
"Aug 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,could be better...but I was amazed by the action and fighting scenes!
"Aug 6, 2013",POSITIVE,liked it better than others
"Aug 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,The fight scenes were AMAZING...just not enough! Faora is HOT and I hope she is in future movies. Superman s actor did a good job and although he is not the original I'd say he has a bright future.
"Aug 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,too much destruction.
"Aug 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"As someone who isn't grown up with superman but knows some of the basic behind it, the new superman is the best hero movie to date. I like the modern narrative and the constant action pack, none of that sappy fluffy superman that bored me to tears."
"Aug 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Man of Steel represents, for many, the Superman film that we've all wanted to see; one that finally takes the character seriously and paints the first true comic book hero in epic, majestic strokes. Personally, while a little on the cheesy side, the iconic 1978 Richard Donner film starring Christopher Reeve fit the bill nicely. Nevertheless, filmmaking as it is today, a truly modern take on the Superman tale sounded like an idea ripe with potential and had the makings of a truly great film. The trailers certainly did more than a good job of promising such; the action and visuals looked spectacular and the emphasis seemed to be on the moral and philosophical implications that a character like Superman would have to go through, if he existed in our world. This is an approach that obviously follows on from Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy; Nolan and David Goyer came up with the stories for both Man of Steel and that trilogy, plus Goyer wrote the screenplay for this and Batman Begins. I had my initial reservations with such an approach; whereas Batman is the story of an exceptional, yet very real human being transforming himself into a legendary crime fighter/vigilante through harsh physical training and ingenuity, Superman is about an alien on Earth who happens to look exactly like a human with god like powers that defy the laws of physics, paramount of which has him flying around past the speed of sound in blue and red spandex and cape. To say the least, it's a difficult concept to ground in reality; an attempt at such that seemed to reek of pretentiousness.  But on the other hand, what an ambitious and potentially fascinating undertaking; what would the world think if they found out about such a person living on Earth, what choices would have to be made, what challenges and strife would that person have to go through? On top of that, the cast was populated with immensely talented actors. All the ingredients were in place for something quite spectacular. Alas, while not without considerable merit, the results end up being disappointingly less than the sum of its parts.

The basic parameters of the Superman story are still in place. There's a distant world called Krypton, whose core has started to self-destruct due to over-exploitation by its humanoid inhabitants. One of these, the lead scientist Jor-El, warns the Kryptonian council of the Armageddon that's about to ensue and urges them to take appropriate measures, but they pay no heed to his advice. Enter General Zod, who also has designs on saving Krypton, but by orchestrating a military coup rather than relying on diplomacy, much to the dismay of Jor-El, his once good friend. In amongst all this chaos, Jor-El and his wife Lara have given birth to a child, who they decide to send away in a capsule through space away from the destruction of Krypton to seek refuge on a safe planet, in this case Earth. Once the baby Kal-El arrives on Earth, we skip ahead 30 years where Kal-El of Krypton has become Clark Kent of Smallville Kansas, who has gained incredible super strength and powers during his time adapting to the Terran environment, travelling the globe anonymously taking odd jobs and hitch hiking from place to place. He covertly uses his extraordinary powers to enact heroic deeds across the Earth as he searches for the truth of his real origin. He eventually discovers an old space probe that crashed on Earth from Krypton thousands of years ago, which contains the holographic spectre of his long dead biological father that informs him of his origins, his true name and his true purpose on Earth before handing him his iconic suit. As it turns out that purpose will be tested when General Zod, having survived Krypton's destruction through imprisonment in the Phantom Zone, manages to find Kal-El on Earth and threatens to terraform the planet into the resurrected Krypton at the expense of all humanity. Will Kal, aka Clark, or Superman as the humans come to know him, find the strength to stop Zod and fulfil his true purpose to save humanity?

Man of Steel gets points for ambition. This is unlike any version of Superman we've seen on screen thus far. Many aspects of typical canon are thrown out the window in favour something different, in some cases actually something better. Certain parts of the backstory are fleshed out; we hear more about the Kryptonian society and the political rifts that lead to its destruction, plus Zod's character is much more interesting than previously seen in Superman II, someone who's driven by the will to preserve his people's legacy rather than just wanting to rule everything out of an inflated self-ego. We also see a brief glimpse of how the young Clark is able to control his powers when they run havoc with his mind on his first discovery of them. More interestingly we get a different angle on the conflicts within Superman. Being so different from everyone else on Earth, with powers and strength that are likely to scare people into marginalising and attacking him, Clark's Earth parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent, particularly Jonathan, are concerned about keeping Clark's powers a secret, at least until the time comes when he'll surely use them to do great things. This is hard for the young man as all he thinks about is helping others, particularly saving lives when no one else can. Nevertheless, his father is convinced that despite his intensions, humanity won't readily take kindly to such a phenomenon. This has been a facet of previous cinematic interpretations of the character, but it's really pushed forward in this film, leading to some startlingly moving sequences when Clark has to choose when he can and can't use his powers. There's ultimately a theme of trust that runs through a lot of the film; can Clark trust his adopted father's advice, can Superman be trusted by the people of Earth to use his immense powers for good (there's an nice scene where he's interrogated by the US military about this), or if the people of Earth can be trusted by Superman to make the right choice when he finally reveals himself to them. Obviously this comes to a head when Zod and his compatriots come to take over, where Superman must try and put the lives of Earth before his fellow Kryptonians.

This is all wonderful stuff and in concept alone makes for a Superman movie that plays out a lot differently than the light-hearted comic-book inspired previous outings. Screenwriter Goyer and director Zack Snyder both wanted to explore what the character of Superman would be like if translated to the real world, and there's certainly some interesting ideas played up here, making for a fresh take on a well-worn story that conveys a palpable sense of weight and consequence that at times really does feel like a realistic take on an alien invasion. Unfortunately there are some key elements missing from all this; emotionally invested characters and a sense of coherent storytelling. For despite such fertile foundations, ultimately the reason why Man of Steel doesn't entirely work is that it fails to forge a strong connection between the characters and the audience (me at least).

These problems occur early; after a strong beginning on Krypton, the film then skips ahead to when Clark is an adult, after which we periodically get flashbacks of key moments in his life leading up to where he is now, where we see him drifting anonymously from place to place, saving people and eventually finding the Superman suit and confronting Zod. I partly understand the need to speed through much of this as it's a story we've seen many times before and so there's a need to just cut to the important moments and move on. But the problem is that we never see the main character progress in a meaningful way. During the flashback heavy first hour, despite being the most interesting half of the movie, each snapshot of Kal's life just seems awfully self-contained and truncated to a point where we don't get a sense of a character going through a journey, rather we're told about individual parts of his life without them carrying forward into the present day in a meaningful way. A few of the flashbacks don't even seem to cohere with what's happening in the present beyond the most superficial details (e.g. Clark sees a school bus, so it cuts to him saving a school bus as a child). The characters don't speak very naturally either, rather in artificially weighty speeches that serve only to exposit character motivation and story in a cold, robotic fashion. It's a shame because many of sequences work very well on their own. This leads to big events taking place that lack a sense of significance, because we've only seen disjointed moments of the character's life with little baring on current events; chief being Superman's first flight in the suit, which is a triumphant, soring sequence on its own that doesn't hold together with the rest of the film as we're not given the proper context for what it means to the character. Even worse, there are things that just go unexplained, like why Clark would want to search the mysterious artefact that turns out to be a Kryptonian ship without even knowing what it is to start with, which stems from the audience never being told why he left home and went nomadic in the first place.

The second half of the movie is much more coherent with very few flashbacks, but suffers from other problems, chief of which is not carrying through with any of those wonderful ideas posited in the first half. Instead we get a set of extended action sequences of Superman fighting Zod and the Kryptonians. It starts off dazzlingly enough; the sense of devastating power these beings possess is very well portrayed, with an element of danger as Superman tries to desperately protect as many people as he can. But it soon devolves into mindless, seemingly endless noise as the film focuses more on stopping Zod's terraforming plan than on exploring how Superman is challenged ethically or physically by any of it. We get a surprisingly dull climactic set piece which serves only to give the characters stuff to do to defeat the bad guys while extraordinary scenes of mass destruction take place; there's no tension or excitement, because the sequence just isn't very interesting in execution or concept. There's nothing that serves to enrich the ideas that we saw before, nor are the characters doing anything of consequence, despite the supposed weight of the situation, which involves the death of humanity. At the end, the inevitable confrontation between Zod and Superman, which should have been the highlight, ends up being superfluous, as I'd already seen enough mass destruction and chaos at this point that I just didn't care about what the outcome was going to be.

On the plus side, the film does look consistently spectacular, at least from a technical perspective as the colour pallet is dreary and dull for the most part. There's just a nice sense of scope and size to everything that makes the film feel massive. The action sequences, particularly the fights, have a ferocity that can be quite breath-taking at times, although the close quarters camera work and quick cuts can obscure the action. The flying sequences, however, are simply stunning in a way never seen before. The design work is top notch, the early scenes on Krypton showing some really ornate alien landscapes and architecture. The costume design is also really nice, Superman's suit in particular looking far from ridiculous and in fact looking very slick and imposing. Hans Zimmer's score is a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand there are some grand compositions, particularly in the Krypton sequence and the first flight scene. On the other hand, many of the action sequences seem to have the exact same deafening rhythm that never stands out and serves only to provide background noise. There are some gems in there, but overall not among the composer's best work.

The performances, as to be expected from this cast, are uniformly solid. Henry Cavill makes both the perfect looking Superman and one with a lot of presence; he's cold and mysterious when he needs to be, but also warm and very human at other times, and yet again very authoritarian and take charge but still very humble. It's a shame the script doesn't contain more for him to work with, because even with the very little he has, he manages to make something of it. Michael Shanon makes a steely yet ferocious Zod, one whose single-minded determination is forcefully portrayed. Amy Adams does what she can with the limited presence of Lois Lane, who starts off an interesting character but soon just becomes a plot construct, just there to either get in the way or move the plot forward. Russell Crowe has a very dignified, strong presence as Jor-El, a character who's clearly full of wisdom and a quick resolve. Lawrence Fishburne is a big actor to have in such a small role as Perry White, chief editor of the Daily Planet newspaper for which Lois works for, but once again he does well with what he has. Lastly Kevin Kostner and Diane Lane are wonderful as Jonathan and Martha Kent, the characters that really bring all of the few genuinely affecting scenes in the film. Special mention should be given to Antje Traue, who plays one of Zod's Kryptonian lieutenants, Faora. Despite having no real character depth, she makes a very imposing, coldly brutal villain; one who steals the spotlight whenever she appears.

On the whole, Man of Steel is a mixed bag. There are some genuinely good things to say about it and a lot of things that, at least in concept, should've worked really well. Unfortunately because of the shallow, aimless execution, it all ends up going nowhere and eventually settles for mindless spectacle. After what many considered an extremely disappointing Superman entry in Superman Returns back in 2006, Man of Steel held the hopes of many fans that we'd see a return to form for the character. While this film does have a very vocal fan base, I unfortunately can't call myself one of them. It's not necessarily a bad movie, just a frustratingly mediocre one. In the end, the film was good enough to hold my interest for the greater part of two thirds, but ultimately represents a lot of potential that goes largely untapped; hopefully the announced sequel/crossover with Batman will have more luck."
"Aug 6, 2013",POSITIVE,I thought this was a great reintroduction of Superman. The backstory was interesting and the character seemed humbled by this past...the ending left me wondering if superman is more vulnerable than I once believed.
"Aug 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"Directed by Zack Snyder and produced and co-masterminded by Christopher Nolan, this is a page 1 reboot of Superman. Forget the Richard Donner original and it's sequels and the underrated Bryan Singer take. This is a more human and grittier take on Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's creation. Despite some tiny niggles, it's a powerful, entertaining and exciting superhero caper. Kal-El (Henry Cavill) learns that he came from another world, the planet Krypton, son of Scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and wife Lara (Ayelet Zurer). Kal-El was raised as Clark Kent by kindly farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane). But, he is struggling to come to terms with his powers, and soon discovers his purpose on Earth, and his secret is discovered by Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams). But, Earth isn't safe, and General Zod (Michael Shannon) comes to earth looking for Jor-El's son, seeking vengeance for being exiled, but Clark/Kal-El has to fight this unstoppable evil. This is a very powerful and moving epic superhero movie, trying to reimagine Superman for a modern age, and it works. Snyder is very respectful to the mythology of the character and his origins, and he gets the best from this amazing ensemble cast. Cavill is a great Superman, and he makes it his own."
"Aug 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Heavily flawed as far as his past goes. The action was amazing...... for a while. Superman was created to be a force of good that put the greater good above everything. Now he's playing bowling-for-buildings with other Kryptonians. On top of that, it looked like he was fighting General Zod out of rage and not to save lives. In the comic books, Superman took the fight to space because he was only interested in saving lives, and who knows how many lives were lost as a result of the rivalry between Kal-El and Zod? This movie gives what this generation wants to see: mindless destruction in a battle between super-powered aliens. Henry Cavill fails to give what Christopher Reeve gave as Superman: a force for good that fights for truth, justice, and the American way; not just a force that levels a city packed with innocent civilians."
"Aug 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Great beginning, went lame on Earth"
"Aug 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"pretty good but dark knight rises 
was better"
"Aug 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,a nice take of the Superman story but a little week on plot
"Aug 6, 2013",POSITIVE,Best superman movie ever made.
"Aug 6, 2013",POSITIVE,It is awesome and it is underrated and superman returns is overrated
"Aug 5, 2013",POSITIVE,surprised by how much I liked this movie by far the best superman they have made
"Aug 5, 2013",POSITIVE,"I would definitely watch this movie again...Action, story-line, a great creation"
"Aug 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,Special effects are excellent.
"Aug 5, 2013",POSITIVE,If you didn't like this movie there is something wrong with you.
"Aug 5, 2013",POSITIVE,"In true Christopher Nolan style, ""Man of Steel"" is as epic as they come. Intensely entertaining & very well done with a killer cast"
"Aug 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Pretty cool Superman origin story.

SFX were great. Story was there. SciFi alien tech was there. Decent movie."
"Aug 5, 2013",POSITIVE,This was a good movie despite what critics say. It's a different take on Superman. A reader Superman not the boy scout in tights. I like the original Superman but I like this ever better.
"Aug 5, 2013",POSITIVE,"I have never really been a fan of the Superman movies. I know they're suppose to be campy, but I just can't get into it. Now, all of that aside, Man of Steel is my favorite Superman movie. Yes, I admit it does have it's faults but all of the superman movies have problems. When compared to the other superman movies, Man of Steel is a movie with a lot of action and without any of the cheese that makes the first 4 movies hard to enjoy."
"Aug 5, 2013",NEGATIVE,Visually nice but the characters and story is not.
"Aug 5, 2013",NEGATIVE,Very long and drawn out. Did not like too much.
"Aug 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Excellent redo on Superman.  Plus, Army Rangers make an appearance.  Although, does the one female Captain have to really act like a Valley Girl?"
"Aug 5, 2013",POSITIVE,loved this version!!
"Aug 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,Not bad for a reboot
"Aug 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,it was an awesome movie but it was missing parts
"Aug 5, 2013",NEGATIVE,A not so great movie and with a lot of errors
"Aug 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Okay again this isn't my sort off film but I enjoyed it! Amazing scenes and directed brilliantly, felt it was a little too long but it is superman after all!"
"Aug 5, 2013",POSITIVE,"4 supervised kid- stars! Over the top, nice story re-write approach. Not too scary for a tough 8yo. kid...  Plus, I'll see anything with Amy Adams;)"
"Aug 5, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This is the worst Superman movie I have seen - all action, no acting."
"Aug 5, 2013",POSITIVE,Best superman movie ever and a great super hero movie in general. See it ASAP.
"Aug 5, 2013",POSITIVE,Definately recreated Superman....best remake yet.....best since Chistopher Reeves
"Aug 5, 2013",POSITIVE,"I don't see anything wrong with this fantastic Superman film. Personally, I think it's Zack Snyder's best work."
"Aug 5, 2013",POSITIVE,I thought it was pretty good for a Superman movie.
"Aug 5, 2013",POSITIVE,best movie this year by far
"Aug 5, 2013",POSITIVE,"Phenomenal. Not like the comics, but still so good."
"Aug 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,"An exciting, if humourless, retelling of the superman legacy, a descent setup for a franchise which will hopefully flesh things out a little more."
"Aug 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,I actually need to see this again. I was way to close to the screen. Front row.....smh. I could not get into and and could not really see it.
"Aug 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A dark, action packed blockbuster, lack of character development, but enjoy the actions and amazing CGI."
"Aug 5, 2013",NEGATIVE,"A boring abundance of explosions at the expense of a gripping storyline. Kevin Costner delivers a performance that redeems this mess somewhat but this adaptation of Superman is from start to finish, undeniably Super-meh."
"Aug 5, 2013",POSITIVE,One of the best reboots I've seen in a long while
"Aug 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This was the one of the rare instances where I actually go to the movies. The film even though it was quite long, you did not notice the length because the story maintained your interest for the entire length of the movie. The film was extremely well edited and even though there were many chronological ""chops and changes"" this was not at all unnerving or unsettling as it was used to add to the story as it progressed. In spite of the fact the the story of superman is engrained in the subconscious it was a fascinating interpretation of the story that kept the integrity of the original.
Enjoyable movie. Highly recommended."
"Aug 1, 2013",NEUTRAL,Not a very good story line but there was plenty of cgi action to keep you fairly interested
"Aug 1, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Pretty good, ending a little weird.  A bit concerned of his many times this is going to be remade."
"Aug 1, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Superman's here to save the world! And by the world, he means america. And by saving, he means destroying fucking everything and killing a mass amount of people. Atrocious."
"Aug 1, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It was good. Mostly, I liked the focus on Krypton, and Jor El and General Zod. But it was this focus that left Superman himself a little wanting. Since I'm sure there will be a sequel, then I consider this to be a good intro to this new Superman franchise."
"Aug 1, 2013",NEGATIVE,I has a perfect flashbacks until lois came. Somehow the story tries to fit her in didn't work out that well.
"Aug 1, 2013",POSITIVE,"M√™me s'il souffre de certaines carences, de raccourcis et/ou de sc√®nes pas forc√©ment subtiles et essentielles, Man of steel arrive √† g√©n√©rer une √©motion d'une intensit√© rare. Franchement j'avais pas ressenti √ßa depuis des ann√©es. Et les s√©quences avec Costner sont juste sublimes!"
"Aug 1, 2013",POSITIVE,"Not only does this reboot completely make us forget about the massive failure of the 2006 reboot Superman Returns but is also better well done than the Reeves Superman 3 and 4 movies. While it still doesn't reach the heights of both Donner versions, it does take the character out of that comic book reality and brings it into real life a-la Batman Begins style. The magical trinity of filmmaking talents - Nolan, Snyder and Goyer are incredible and this trio definitely should work together over and over. The casting of Lois while an unusual choice proved to be the right choice in the end and makes you completely forget about the horrible job that Bosworth did in 2006 with Superman Returns. General Zod, another fine actor but I keep thinking what the film would've been like with a different character playing Zod. It's an epic blockbuster but somehow remains grounded in morality thanks to a brilliant performance by Cavill who was the perfect choice for the role. It's gritty and natural, thanks to Nolan for his input we actually 'feel' for this incarnation of Superman and his internal struggle with loyalty to old and new. This superman reboot evens beats out the Dark Knight Rises as a more prolifically made and manufactured piece of film making. There are always minor things which seemed to annoy people but overall, the strength of the movie outweighs the annoyances."
"Aug 1, 2013",POSITIVE,This is the superman movie we all wanted- a full-out epic blockbuster hit!
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"Compare to Avengers. Has better story. Better acting. Better dialogue. Better camera/art direction. This is the Superman movie I had been thinking in my head. He's an alien. People finally react to that. He creates collateral damage ... naturally. He feels human and we can finally start to get that. Well done, IMO."
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,Good take on Superman. Looking forward to seeing a Superman Batman film.
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"While alot of the action can be described as over-the-top, unnecessary, or just downright ridiculous....that's the fun of movies. With impressive acting by the cast, outstanding visuals, and an engaging plot, I do believe the Superman franchise has finally found itself a winner after a number of flunks in past years."
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"I couldn't disagree more about the general mediocre review of this movie!  In fact I'd call it the best piece of science fiction I've seen since Minority Report or maybe even Blade Runner!  Fantastic acting, amazing special effects, cleaned up the wimpy Lois Lane problem of the original, cleaned up the weak background story of the original, which tied the story together much more tightly.   Fantastic!  I'll definitely see it again!"
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"So glad they brought this ""NEW"" Superman to the big screen!  This is something that the franchise desperately needed & the fans as well wanted to see.   This movie wasn't suppose to be about ""fun"" or ""romance"".... Yeah, Christopher Reeve brought Superman to the big screen in a big way, but the days of ""Christopher Reeves Superman"" is outdated and it was more than time for the Reboot, this was proven by the bad box office returns for the Brandon Roth ""Superman Returns"", it was not what the fans wanted to see.... ""Man Of Steel"" brought what was wanted to see & needed by the fans.  Now the next sequel will include ""Superman & Batman""!!"
"Jul 31, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This is the worst superhero movie I ever saw. And I've seen them all: Daredevil, Steel, Elektra, the other newer superman."
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,The best superman next to Christopher Reeves
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"Clever statements, great score and good lead. Snyder is nowhere near Nolan's caliber but holds his own."
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie lots of fun.
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the critics.  While flawed, this is by far the most visceral Superman film to date."
"Jul 31, 2013",NEGATIVE,I felt this film lacked substance and at times was boring.  The characters were poorly drawn and seemed unrealistic.  Another Hollywood film blown into greatness without the amplitude to back it up.
"Jul 31, 2013",NEUTRAL,A really wish it wasn't so much constant action and the characters development could have been much better. However they did do a very good job slipping some references at the big super man fans.
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great movie! Lots of action, elegant special effects, darkness and believable evildoers. This movie does for superman what the dark knight did for batman. Do not miss it!"
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,Man of Steel is a great movie with awesome action scenes and a great and interesting plot.
"Jul 31, 2013",NEUTRAL,A bit confusing at the first part but good at the second one
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,Extremely well done great fight scenes
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie does not deserve the criticism it is receiving.  It was an interesting retake on Superman's origin, a story that has been told many ways.  It felt fresh and was definitely a new take on the Man of Steel.  It will be interesting to see where the Superman vs Batman movie will take it next."
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"Thought this was a great movie. Henry Cavil played it just right and what a bod !!!!
Gotta say like Terence Stamps Zod better"
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,Pretty good. still not a superman fan.
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"AH-MAZING!! I never give 5 stars but its well worth it. The fight scenes in air are incredible. Definitely have to experience in 3D or IMAX, as I did."
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,Best superhero film I've seen.
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this movie a lot and hope to see more of this Superman.  I think that a lot of the criticism aimed at this movie: no humor, dark tones, no hope, etc... are brought forth by memories of the earlier Christopher Reeve films and the inability to accept that this portrayal is very different from those films.  While the Christopher Reeve films were great Superhero classics of their times, every portrayal should not be the same as those.  This portrayal captures a Superman fighting in the real world, facing his brand new role, faced with overwhelming odds and having to make split second decisions to save the planet.  It is a very real world scenario with collateral damage happening everywhere, and having lasting effects into the next few films.  Overall it is about Clark finding his place in the world, his responsibility to it, and giving his all to the people of his adopted planet."
"Jul 31, 2013",NEUTRAL,The First half of the movie was brilliant with the superman's origins but the Second half was so dragging that i waited when the film would end. Zack Snyder could have reduced his usual action visualisations. With Goyer's wonderful Script and Zack Snyder's mediocre Directing the movie didn't reach the effect everyone expected.
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"New Era of Comics brought to life.
The New DC is rough and tumble world Supes IS NOT it a boy scout anymore...NO MORE SHY, BUMBLING Kent to make fun of. The people trashing the film need to read some of the new Supes before being overly critical."
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,Superman is my favorite super hero. This was my ultimate favorite . Liked how Lois Lane new who he was . Everything about it I totally enjoyed.
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,Very very very good!!!
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,We all like the movie....super man .....long movie
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"out of all the superman movies that I have seen and I have seen them all, this one shows him doing something that no other superman movie has done and with that I would say that this is an action packed movie not to be missed"
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,The best film ever made
"Jul 31, 2013",NEUTRAL,very good movie just thought superman could have done a little better of an acting job
"Jul 31, 2013",NEUTRAL,Not bad. Bit slow and repetitive at time
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"Went to see this with my Son and we thought it was done well the story line was great the actors for the most part were spuer in their role and here is the ""But"" Two things I didn't like Superman killing people and the second thing is hair on chest showing through his Costume. P.S. Costume was awesome! Must have been really hot in that Leather suit. Oh yeah one of the spending never show Superman taking off his beard with me and a mirror. But they never showed him take his beard off but they had signs all over the city and in the subway by Gillette Asking: ""How does he shave""? But we never saw the answer to the question. last thing CGI special effects extraordinary. Kent's thoughts."
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,Very good film well thought out so worth watching.
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"A good movie,like it a lot"
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,Amazing by far the best superman movie i have seen.
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"Not a great movie Compared to what Marvel has done. But it can be seen how they wanted this to be a large scale movie.  It's worth seeing a couple times.  It's enjoyable,  but not as good as Iron Man or the Avengers. DC has some catching up to do."
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"I can't find anything bad  to say about this movie. Acting, cinematography, music, editing, all clear concise and purposeful. However, the story... there were some cringe moments that took me out of the movie that turn this 5 out of 5 into a 4. First, the ""who hoo I can fly"" scene. Second, the reporter stuck in the rubble scene. Could have done without them."
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,Man of Steel is an action packed film.
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,What is wrong with people it was a good movie
"Jul 31, 2013",POSITIVE,Amazing movie. I am very much excited to watch Man Of Steel 2. It is going to be amazing having Superman and Batman.
"Jul 31, 2013",NEGATIVE,Hated it. It was REALLY LONG!!!!x(
"Jul 30, 2013",POSITIVE,The cast are wonderful especially Crowe and the reboot is largely successful. If only director Snyder could stay out of his own way and not flood the final act with too much CGI this would've been as good as Batman Begins.
"Jul 30, 2013",NEGATIVE,disappointed:) I really thought it would be better
"Jul 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,Better then last one
"Jul 30, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie was a great superhero movie, one of the best! 5/5 √¢¬≠?√¢¬≠?√¢¬≠?√¢¬≠?√¢¬≠?"
"Jul 30, 2013",POSITIVE,I was so happy to see super man come back he's my favorite super hero and a perfect reboot
"Jul 30, 2013",NEGATIVE,Didnt really make sense
"Jul 30, 2013",POSITIVE,Best take on super man yet zack Snyder really impresses with the story and visuals
"Jul 30, 2013",POSITIVE,Cool movie LoL hot boy
"Jul 30, 2013",POSITIVE,"It is a good, thoughtful reboot, which I think will lay the ground for (hopefully) great sequels."
"Jul 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,Curti a elabora√ß√£o das explica√ß√µes e as atua√ß√µes. Melhor Lois de todos os tempos ( amo Amy Adams). Ahazo esse Henry Cavill...Superman mais forte de todos!
"Jul 30, 2013",POSITIVE,"EXCELLENT! Fights are always so interesting and moves me when the soft part comes, I love this film!"
"Jul 30, 2013",NEGATIVE,"A Superman origin story that gets pretty much everything right until a disappointing, rage-inducing third act that erases most of the good will built up beforehand. I don't wanna talk about it :("
"Jul 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,I like that it follows the actual comic books. The action scenes were drawn out a bit. I think it lacked in direction.
"Jul 30, 2013",POSITIVE,Excellent movie had a great story line to it
"Jul 30, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Okay this is the best way for me to put it. Its about the same length of the Dark knight and the Dark Knight Rises, but this feels way longer. Does that sum it up?"
"Jul 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Very enjoyable. I really like this Superman. He reminds me of the comics without necessarily reminding me of Reeve. Decent story but not that engaging. Lacked character development above all. Still, good acting and likeable characters and at least I cared what happened to people."
"Jul 30, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This sucked. If it wasn't for the awesome fight scenes, this movie would be complete crap. Even Michael Shannon's perfect insanity couldn't save this film. There were so many dumb moments. This just simply failed. So many cringe worthy lines. David Goyer's limitations of a writer are really showcased here. Which is unfortunate, since he did such a great job with the Dark Knight series. Superman just isn't his character. Maybe it was Zack Snyder's fault too. Who knows. Overall, I just fucking hated it. Not a good movie. Ok Concept, poor execution."
"Jul 30, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This a horrible movie. Truly. A horrible movie. Hollywood has totally forgotten how to right a plot. Such a great mythology, such a waste."
"Jul 30, 2013",POSITIVE,Yaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!! Can't wait for part 2!
"Jul 30, 2013",NEGATIVE,This movie is terrible. It doesn't feel like Superman at all. David Goyer missed it with thia screenplay. I was very disappointed. I honestly have no idea why so many people like this movie. It's just....bad.
"Jul 30, 2013",POSITIVE,Good movie great new story!
"Jul 30, 2013",POSITIVE,It not only has wonderful special effects but it takes superman to a level not yet explored before this. We now get to see a story that at times is depressing but takes superman from being just a symbol of hope but to an actual superheroes which he is. Great film.
"Jul 30, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The graphics were admittedly impressive, and are responsible for all 1 1/2 stars I'm giving this movie. I never bought into it for a second with the pathetic, cheesy lines throughout the whole movie and characters that never developed, shallow relationships, and incredibly stupid premises. **Spoiler** When Superman kills General Zod, there is no reason for it (he could have just flown up, deflected lasers with his hands, etc) and the build-up was long and pointless. What a crap movie and an insult to the audience's intelligence."
"Jul 30, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Lots of action, explosions, destruction but no humour. Made me want to rewatch the old Superman movie."
"Jul 30, 2013",POSITIVE,"brilliant, great new direction. never replace my love for the original Reeve movies. but fantastic, I still believe a man can fly."
"Jul 30, 2013",POSITIVE,"Heard bad reviews but I throughly enjoyed it, could have been improved but still very good"
"Jul 30, 2013",NEGATIVE,"It tries so hard to tell a deep story of Superman's disconnect with the world around him, but fails immensely at getting the audience to connect with him or the world themselves. Every interaction is extremely forced and unbelievable in order to push narrative, leaving gaping plot holes and extremely unconvincing characters. This movie promised a darker and more serious tone to the typically cheery boy scout Superman we know, and what we're left with is an awkwardly stale Superman that feels like an imposter...I mean the damn ""S"" doesn't even stand for Superman. The world around him isn't much better with people acting strangely calm with the revelation of a godlike alien amongst them being targeted by a pissed off one with an agenda. 

Plot, characters, pacing, etc are all over the place and you never find your self immersed between boredom and questioning numerous plot and character flaws. Superman is boring, his parents are forgetable, and Lois Lane horrifically misses the mark. The movie however does have one redeeming quality: Zod. While Zod still suffers from flawed motives that scream plot hole, the character is intense and awesome; being the stories sole believable character. While I didn't want an action driven Superman and was really on board with the deeper story the trailers sold me on, my only joy during this flim involved the action scenes capping the beginning and destruction porn grand finale with Zod. 

It dawned on me after the movie that this is the same director who did Sucker Punch, a movie with 3 phenomenal fantasy scape music videos attached to one of the most boring and unrelatable combinations of story and characters I've ever endured. The same crimes are committed here. When there's no CGI and people being punched through buildings, there's no life to this film. In the end, it doesn't feel like a Superman movie and it's tragic that his will be DC's base for fleshing out Justice League to compete with Marvel's Avengers."
"Jul 30, 2013",NEGATIVE,"An alien invasion movie filled with boring action, but some fantastic moments in the flashback sequences. Save your money and re-watch Superman Returns."
"Jul 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Good movie overall, no Dark Knight, but looking forward to the next one."
"Jul 30, 2013",NEGATIVE,Thoroughly disappointing. Most interesting part was when Supes went 9/11 on about 9 buildings. Totally normal for his character.
"Jul 30, 2013",POSITIVE,"it is a visual spectacle! But not much dialogue, but that is ok! it's the best superman so far and people will enjoy it."
"Jul 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,enjoyable but the second half was so boring. Repetitive fight scene and there 's no plot twist.
"Jul 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,Still not a superman fan.
"Jul 30, 2013",POSITIVE,"I have seen every Superman movie ever made, and this had the best backstory -- and best Pa Kent -- of any of them. The ending fight scene was a bit too long, but it was a small price to pay for Kevin Coster's performance."
"Jul 30, 2013",POSITIVE,"Grounding a house hold comic book superhero into reality seems like a recipe for disaster when not done properly, however I beg to differ when it comes to the films that are currently being released by Warner Bros. Man of Steel follows a similar structure to that of The Dark Knight Trilogy. But also, is currently now following the shared fictional universe blueprint that Marvel Studios has been known for in their most recent films. 

Directed by Zack Snyder, Man of Steel, based on the comic book superhero Superman, delivers an untold perspective of this iconic superhero. Snyder is known for his visually breathtaking work. Like in previous films such as, 300, Sucker Punch as well as Watchmen, Snyder delivers and raises the bar of how action sequences in comic book films should be produced. Along with Amri Mokri, the films cinematographer provides stunning scenes that play an integral role with the CGI in this film as specific scenes support and complement on another. What was quite an odd technique to implement was the constant zoom on to various objects, also seen in the trailer. However, over multiple watches the constant zoomed in scenes is not only visually good but I saw that they were an expansion of what the character of Superman is about, being close to his upbringing, where he grew up and how keeps this close to him. Which is generally not seen in many of the previous Superman films as they focused more on just him saving civilians and fighting bad guys.   

Like many rebooted comic book adapted films this is an origin story. Chronicling from his birth on the doomed planet Krypton to literally his first day on the job. If you are familiar with the plot of the Donner Superman films then you can get a grasp on the plot in this film. What are most noticeably seen in this film are the underlying themes and motifs. David S. Goyer, who is most known for his work in The Dark Knight Trilogy, illustrates this grounded origin story. His work combines the aspects of what fans recognise in the comics, cartoons, television shows and previous films mixed with themes and motifs relatable to an audience, regarding humanity, morality, perseverance and hope. Which I thoroughly enjoyed about this film. What separates this film from other contemporary superhero films is the aspect immersing the audience into the possibility of ""what if"". What if a vigilante or an alien lived among us? How would we react? Would we accept them? Are they considered heroes? On the other hand, what I loved most of this film would be the most off putting to an audience. Many fans are familiar with an even paced story mixed in with the action. But what you'll get with this film is genuine story that makes you feel immersed into the psychology of the characters.  

In regards to casting, this film has quite an ensemble cast. From Kevin Costner and Diane Lane portraying Superman's adoptive parents to Russell Crowe and Aylet Zurer being his biological parents. The Man of Steel is portrayed by Henry Cavill, Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Michael Shannon as General Zod, Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, and Antje Traue as Faora to list a few. The cast does an excellent job in portraying their respective characters. Specifically the relationship of Superman and Lois Lane. Cavill not only encompasses the character beautifully but also adds a whole new perspective on Superman. Making him feel vulnerable and emotional but also including the traditional aspects of what we know and love about Superman. What Amy Adams does to her character is very impressing also. Not only does she embody her comic book counterpart but she also portrays a strong, independent woman that is emerging heavily into many films today.

In short, Man of Steel it is a must watch. At times yes the pacing feels fast towards the second half of the film. However, for a film that has had some difficulty in regards to rebooting and reimagining an iconic film franchise it is a film I would most definitely support. Most common complaints concern character development, a very questionable plot, fight scenes that did drag on and a climatic scene that felt every bit more anti-climatic but if you can put those aside this film, like The Dark Knight Trilogy, provides a whole new perspective on approaching superhero films. If your looking for more than just a plot centered on a superhero's actions and a simple drive to why they do what they do rather than focusing on the psychology and essential core of what drives these well-known characters and what shaped them into what they are today, I'd say give this film a watch."
"Jul 30, 2013",POSITIVE,"Gave us a new superman, I liked seeing him in a darker way. Good film."
"Jul 30, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Very terrible movie, wasted my time going to see it."
"Jul 30, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie was amazing! Great 3d effect and great sound, overall good storyline!!! 5 Stars'"
"Jul 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"Good use of all the other stories, a bit longer than necessary though."
"Jul 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,"It was so action packed, I was bored. The movie has bad enough for me to consider leaving the theater. A complete waste of my time."
"Jul 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Lots of story,drama. Action picks up after second part of the movie."
"Jul 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,Don't even bother watching this disgrace
"Jul 29, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie! Welcome back Superman!
"Jul 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great first half, solid but redundant second half."
"Jul 29, 2013",POSITIVE,I loved it!!! Freakin awesome spin on a classic story. Saw first day out and wish I had seen it again before it left the theater.
"Jul 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"Fui ver hoje, excelente filme, a√ß√£o e um roteiro bem constru√≠do."
"Jul 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A visual masterpiece, Snyder almost delivers the Superman film we've all been waiting for after the letdown that was SUPERMAN RETURNS. This is a Clark Kent story that we can actually believe in, and (minus some minor plot holes) really develops a more complete picture of the man underneath the ridiculously tight tights. The movie isn't without its flaws, however. The Lois Lane character falls flat and some of the flight animation creeps dangerously close to 1970s cheese. Overall, this is a good film. I believe between Nolan, Goyer and Snyder it certainly could have been better, but I definitely recommend everyone, or at least every American, should see this film at some point."
"Jul 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"The king of all heroes has returned in the best movie of the year! More than a simple comic book movie, this epic sci fi give us the Superman we always wanted and starts the DC cinematic universe in an amazing way."
"Jul 29, 2013",POSITIVE,Superou as minhas expectativas
"Jul 29, 2013",POSITIVE,great a lot of action
"Jul 29, 2013",POSITIVE,love superman movies they did so much better this time around:)
"Jul 22, 2013",NEUTRAL,After destroying most of Metropolis and probably killing a couple million innocent people does it really heighten the drama by saving a family of four?  My complete review  http://cliffymania.com/blog/2013/06/5-things-we-learned-from-man-of-steel/
"Jul 22, 2013",POSITIVE,"People have to understand that this superman isn't dark like Nolan's batman trilogy. He just lives in today's world trying to understand himself. It's the same superman we know and love just living in a darker world.

Also best movie of the year."
"Jul 22, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Ultimately Man Of Steel is the Superman movie that everyone asked for. We wanted punching and action and that's what we got. Its the polar opposite to Bryan Singer's Superman Returns, but that doesn't necessarily make it a better film. 

Man Of Steel is about Kal-El becoming Superman, but its a goal that he never really seems to achieve. At least not the Superman we know. He is not so much a hero in this film as he is the simply catalyst for our planet and everyone on it to get their arses kicked and their stuff smashed to smithereens by Zod and his mates. There are insurmountable fatalities (not mentioned) of people going about their daily business as Superman appears to have tossed all the shits he gave about the human race aside. At a few points he throws his enemies so hard at buildings that they burst into flames and crumble like cereal, but Zod is going to kill everyone on Earth, so fuck that guy in the petrol station buying a sausage roll.

The movie is visually impressive, for the most part, with a few exciting action scenes that build up to a crazy half hour ending filled to the brim with fighting, explosions, flying cars, reverse-gravity machines, people running, windows smashing, neck breaking and concrete mashing, whilst two computer game characters fly at each other really fast and do head-butts and and knees and stuff. After its all done and the city is rubble (literally), someone shouts, ""He saved us"", but she fails to mention all the people that he didn't save and the billions of dollars they will need to rebuild Metropolis and repair the water and electrical systems. Not to mention all the funeral costs.

All criticism aside, I enjoyed watching the movie, and I was never bored, but I wasn't on the edge of my seat with excitement either. The Kryptonian woman whizzing around snapping soldiers like twigs was about the best bit of the movie. 

See it once, but wait for a while before you watch it a second time."
"Jul 22, 2013",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed this film, which is good because I was worried that this might be another fail Superman movie."
"Jul 22, 2013",NEUTRAL,special effects were amazing
"Jul 22, 2013",NEGATIVE,"There's just something that kept me from liking this movie. Maybe it was the non-linear way of story-telling. There was too much jumping from past to present that drew me away from the more important parts of the plot. The middle dragged and I thought a lot of the scenes were almost unnecessary. When the movie was on its third-act, my excitement was gone. It could have been better but they weren't able to capitalize on the moments where it could have shined. On the plus side the acting was very good and I liked the star-studded cast. I enjoyed Russell Crowe's take on Jor-El and Henry Cavill is a very good fit for Superman. I know there is still hope that the sequel will be way better than this."
"Jul 22, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Good, not great. Don't redo cannon too. Pseudo Vulcan Krypton? Avatar bats? And was the Cryptex plot necessary or coherent at all? No, not really. Superman and Zod well cast, everyone else, not at all. Costner stole the show I must admit."
"Jul 22, 2013",POSITIVE,Um √≥timo reinicio para o Superman nos cinemas.
"Jul 22, 2013",NEUTRAL,Average film which seems to rely too much on special fx than storytelling. There's only so many buildings you can see destroyed before it starts to become boring.
"Jul 22, 2013",POSITIVE,Best 2013 Summer Movie
"Jul 22, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Liked how they told the history & backstory for viewers that didn't know going in, but besides that it was very choppy & jumped around too much & the fight scenes were just a chaotic mess & didn't seem well thought out. The final act was good though, but as a die hard superman fan it misses the mark for me. Maybe my expectations were just too great"
"Jul 22, 2013",NEGATIVE,This film provides little entertainment. I am not saying that the first 25 minutes on Krypton wasn't good but I am saying that Synder has created a Transformer like film that relys on CGI and explosions to adapt to a wider audience. Some shots where quite a spectacle but the film as a whole delivers nothing but hope for the next film to not turn out like the last or Marvels The Avengers
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie is absolutely amazing
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,good movie luv story line of movie
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,loved it another please
"Jul 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,it was good. not the best I've seen
"Jul 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,So so rehash. But worth sitting through.
"Jul 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Enjoyable enough movie but is definitely no Batman Begins. Got to be one of the highest death tolls of a recent movie, without actually seeing much of it. How many people (did) live in Metropolis? Well they are all dead now."
"Jul 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It could have been so much better, but the story was not very well developed. Such a shame."
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,A thrill ride that kept you uneasy and made you jump at every corner!!
"Jul 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The action fighting was done well, but I didn't think the movie spent much time on Clark growing up and becoming superman. Generol zod was a brilliant character, but his death wasn't ""brilliant"""
"Jul 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Superman as a hobo, lol... actually this was a very good movie, it was no Avengers mind you, I liked the whole Superman is an alien angle.. I never really thought of it like that before.."
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"Cavill's performance carries the film's slow drama and the action's repetitiveness far, but not far enough."
"Jul 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,What is that?How it could be possible that the goodest superhero of the industry accept to destroy everything and who accept de death of so many people.Zack Snyder must read som DC comics before his next project.
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,loved all the superman movies
"Jul 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Nothing like any of the other exciting super hero movies, superman has lost it's fire..."
"Jul 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,45 minutes and 30 demolished buildings too much.
"Jul 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I liked that I got more of Superman's background than in previous installments, at least from what I remember, and the dynamic between him and Lois was cute, but the battle scenes were a little over the top. I mean they looked awesome, and I'm not one to freak out about how many ""humans"" are dying (it's a movie, who cares, humanity almost got wiped out too, that's the point) but the amount of the city and world that got destroyed was ridiculous. I mean everytime superman would go to help in this iteration, he will destroy half the city if he falls. We'll see if this ever gets the sequel treatment, I wouldn't mind, and if anyone noticed there was a little teaser with the Lex Corp gas tanker at the end."
"Jul 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Still my favorite film rendition of the character, but the story is seriously flawed from top to bottom. It does handle the overall themes better than the other film versions, but Man of Steel suffers from prolonged, hollow action sequences that carry no weight, meaning, or value."
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,was a good story but a little long. Overall not s bad entry in what I hope to be a good and successful franchise.
"Jul 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Man of Steel was perhaps a movie I thought I would never see. Why would I? I loved the mix of love story and super hero magic in the original Superman and Superman II. Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder as Superman/Clark Kent and Lois Lane were well written that it made us believe a Man of Steel could fall in love with a gutsy, earthly woman. Gene Hackman was perhaps a nemesis that certainly showed his humanity as well. So what is there to like in Man of Steel. The CGI was better than average, although Krypton was not shown to be a utopian society. Henry Cavill was actually more than passable as the superhero. Amy Adams was gutsy, cynical, and not fleshed out enough as Lois Lane. It does not mean there could not have been chemistry...there were just to many expository scenes and mayhem/rescue shots. The film succeeded on the level when Clark Kent doubted his purpose once he found out his identity. He had a rough childhood and had a hard time being different. His adopted parents the Kents played actually admirably by Diane Lane and Kevin Costner ; they brought the most humanity to the piece. The rest of the time we are confronted with a Messiah plot that seems heavy handed. The movie fails to have a lot of heart...it does have a little and with Christopher Nolan behind it, the film succeeds. In fact the film borrows the Zod storyline from Superman II and that also might be why it does not completely succeed... Michael Shannon is all right as Zod...yet the ghost of Terence Stamp is behind it all and the actress they hired as Zod's accomplice from the Phantom Zone...looks surprisingly like Sarah Douglas from Superman II. Don't miss many shots of corporate tie-ins like IHOP (where are the Superman Pancakes) and 7-11. One corporate tie-in is fictional however, Lexcorp reminds you that Luther was left out of the mix all together. Oh, well, this was much better than After Earth."
"Jul 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The audience was restless for the first half of this movie. If the people on either end hadn't fallen asleep, I'd have left. And the fight scenes . . . seriously? If a fighter jet's artillery doesn't stop the bad guys, why would anyone think a hand held pistol would work? How many times, Superman, do you have to punch him in the gut and throw him through buildings before you realize that plan isn't working?"
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"It was one of the amazing films of 2013, I've seen, but it was too loud, the score was overused, and did not enjoy the dark and depressing origin story of superman."
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie is so good.  A great action film.
"Jul 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It tries it's best but ultimately, it's a mediocre Hollywood action movie. It can be said that it is better than previous Superman films, partly due to Cavill playing an excellent Clark Kent, however, they aren't that hard to beat."
"Jul 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,the best superman movie which isn't saying much kinda boring but the fight scenes were awesome and make up for the movies lack of much story and boring
"Jul 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,Liked  the movie but Amy Adams is the worst Lois Lane.
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie, it doesn't deserve that rotten rating, it isnt perfect but its still really good, amazing special effects and fight scenes (maybe too many) good story and has the emotion ive been looking for in a Superman film, but needs a lot more emotion. has great potential"
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great Movie! Not the Dark Knight but what more can you expect from the ""purest"" superhero?"
"Jul 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Where's the ""you should have spent your money elsewhere"" button? Not good, pure and simple."
"Jul 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Not exactly the Superman we are all used to seeing but I liked this story, and I liked the revamped Lois Lane. Superman has typically been my least favorite superhero so I enjoyed the change."
"Jul 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Hated it. Hated it. Hated it. Wife loved it because, in her words, ""Henry Cavill"" was hot. With the exception of a couple of cool fight scenes, this was an INCREDIBLY boring, slow movie, with a ton of talk....especially in the first 30 minutes or so. It clearly goes away from the story of Superman. The producers and writers for some reason felt they could take the storyline somewhere else, and they failed. There aren't many times that I go to the theatre and leave feeling thoroughly pissed off, but I did after this. I almost left in the middle, but stayed because my son thought the fight scenes were ""cool"". I say again, I HATED it."
"Jul 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Virtually joyless, pointless dark and not a Superman movie.

There are some fantastic scenes in this film and hints of something so much better. Unfortunately all of those scenes combined likely added up to five or ten minutes of the overall picture. They seemed to be so desperate to distance this film from the cannon of the previous era that they forgot who the character actually was. 

How many people did Superman cause the death of in the various, overlong, tedious battles that went on? It was never clear if EVERYONE was evacuated so we'll assume that a lot of people died and most of the city was decimated. Never, at any point, does he seem concerned about any of this. 

Visually stunning, with a handful of great moments does not make a very good Superman film. For me at any rate."
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,Greatest Superhero Origin Movie behind Superman:The Movie
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"Besides dehumanizing Clark Kent, hiding Superman's underwear and the introduction of a deus ex machina at the end of the film, it was great CGI fun!"
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,good movie. worth the watch. not as good as batman. lol
"Jul 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,Super long and super disappointing
"Jul 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Much better than superman IV and superman returns but a lack of emotional connection or depth keeps it from scoring higher. And of course the last 25 minutes is all over the top bombast with poor pacing. Still, lots to like especially toward the beginning."
"Jul 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It never achieves Batman Begins heights, neither does it want to. Man of Steel is a solid popcorn effort which falters with its retelling of an origin story and its lighting pace."
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"Visually epic! It has it's flaws like most films, but it is well worth a watch. And the performances are rock solid! Henry Cavill is perfectly cast, and Michael Shannon & Kevin Costner are really just incredible!"
"Jul 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I did enjoy the Clark Kent portions when he is going through his growing pains process, however when he becomes Superman it devolves into a generic summer blockbuster of destruction with reckless abandon. It's sad, it had so much potential."
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,I give it a 10! A fucking 10!
"Jul 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A very neato alien invasion movie, with an alien that dresses like a superhero. Dragonball Z meets Close Encounters of the Third Kind."
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,good movie. a bit too drawn out tho.
"Jul 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,Proper casting would have probably saved this movie for me.
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"action scenes were very well done, but they got a little extraneous after a while. excellent special effects"
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,A great return for Big Blue.
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie of all!!!!!!
"Jul 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Good enough to get the Justice League movie idea rolling, but I just didn't feel what I expected the film to be."
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,It was better than I expected. it played into the other superman movies really well.
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman Movie EVER!
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,henry cavill √© um col√≠rio para os olhos! al√©m disso as cenas de a√ß√£o e destrui√ß√£o s√£o impressionantes. rola uma vibe meio dark e alien (o filme). boa distra√ß√£o de 2:30hs
"Jul 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,Good super hero movie
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"The story of superman has been told several different ways and this one is told a little different than the one I grew up with. Be that as it may, this was an outstanding action film! The best movie I've seen in a while!"
"Jul 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,Disappointing movie - lame story.  At least the special effects were okay.  The acting was abysmal.
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,I hate to love this movie because I'm such a Batman nerd....but I did love it.
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"Superman has always been to me the most annoying superhero of all time. He is god-like but a little stone renders him pathetic, he takes forever defeating his enemies because he dares not ever use his ""real"" powers and he bores the life out of me with all his Boy Scout speeches and his idolization of the human species.  Now that it's been that I could care less for the man of steel, I have to say that this film almost made me a fan. I say almost because I never will be; 1 film can't save the countless crap movies, boring comics and boring animated films. For once, we were spared the kryptonite plotline, Lex Luthor was nowhere to be seen thank heaven because after that Kevin Spacey thing (WTF was that?!?!) and Sup finally had an enemy (enemies) that gave him the beating of his life and he returned it in kind. Can Zod always be the villain please? Now I hear on the Nerdsphere that everybody's got their speedos in a bunch because there was too much action. Are you kidding me? Trained genocidal Kryptonians come to Earth to fight, there ought to be grandiose devastation! The film did not disappoint. I wish this had been the first Sup film to come out but now it's being buried as an copy of all other summer flicks which is too bad because I very much liked it. I dare even say that I shall purchase a dvd copy once it's out. My very first Superman movie, now that's an accomplishment! High Five Snyder! And of course hats off to you C.Nolan."
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this movie and can't wait to see future installments.
"Jul 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,"While there is much to admire about Man of Steel - wonderful performances by all the leads, some beautiful 'human' moments that shed a more realistic light on the shaping of the pre-Supes Clark Kent, and some genuine spectacle - I walked away wondering what happened to all the people - Superman is a hero of the people, and they seem to be pretty much forgotten, along with Metropolis, which appears to be populated by the small staff of the Daily Planet if the finale is to be believed... Kudos to Nolan and Goyer for their more-somber take on Supes, but the Zack Snyder spectacle lacked a human dimension... Oh, and how Batman will realistically fit into this universe... that's going to be an interesting one to see..."
"Jul 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,The movie lacked excitement and was too long.
"Jul 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It doesn't wow or wonder, but it does entertain."
"Jul 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"Where along the line does this train derail? 
I'm not talking about the movie, I'm talking about the masses who seems to downrate something that I consider one of the better Superhero reboots and generally just Superhero franchise! 

It boggles my mind that a masterpiece like Man of Steel has to recieve such negative remarks.
one after another it seems that critics are throwing rotten eggs at this movie, but gracefully accepts pointless fests of explosions and borderline stand-up comedy material wrapped in superhero spandex, or to be more direct - The Avengers and its beloved jewel of a character, Iron Man. 

No this is beyond unfair, and I feel that it is important that the apparently few people who did enjoy this Movie, speaks their mind, otherwise we will drown in endless Michael Bay inspired CGI trilogies and hysterical witty characters, and I'm not talking about the funny kind.

This movie starts out with a bang and bleeds into a flatline for about half an hour, but that's about the only moment you'll get to take a deep breath before everything starts to rise to a level no short of Legendary.
And generally, that is how I would describe this movie, a story of an aspiring legend.
From the get-go it seems that Snyder felt very comfortable with the hero in question's origin, and doesn't fear taking it to the extremes.
A solid 20-30 minutes of an introduction, on Krypton it self raises the bar for what we can expect, and gives us a more humane look into the parents of our greatest alien hero of all time.

It quickly sets off to reminds us that we are indeed dealing with someone who isn't human, but grows up to be the best kind of human in spite of his alien origin.

At times the Explosions and the dizzying flight sequences feels overwhelming, but that is what this hero is about. And while I perfectly grasp the concept of Superman, it seems that the punchline fell flat to most people, which is indeed a shame, but no reason to disregard it as shallow.
Superhero movies haven't seen this much depth since Batman Begins, and I applaud Snyder for living up to my expectations (hopefully others too) and the massive pressure that was put on him.

As for some of the more important characters besides the Man of steel himself, Michael Shannon as Zod did an absolutely remarkeble job, but fails to deliver that everlasting impression we all like to leave with, when thinking of an awesome villain, but there is a reason behind this.

Before you categorize General Zod as a villain there is a moment of realization where you are met with a patriotic and deeply inspired character that wants to have his world withstand the test of time and chaos it self.
A very noble cause, and to some! Some might even call him a hero in his own right.

When speaking in terms of his performance as General Zod, he was a fresh breath of air, from the redundant shady characters that makes the girls whimper.
Passion would be a great word to attach to his specific performance.

As for Calvin as Superman, it was a choice that seemingly came out of nowhere, but he pulled it off regardless.
I want to remind you that Superman is by default a complicated character, and that it takes a different kind of effort to breath life into the role, but it worked out pretty well and I would be happy to see him return as the man of steel in the sequel we will get, which is said to have Batman in it! As unprofessional as it may seem, I cannot stress enough how important it is to me that they do not demonize Superman in this coming sequel. 
I sincerely hope they will continue the pace of what we have here in the sequel to come, because I found it beyond satisfactory and can only encourage that we see more of this.

Also, Hans Zimmer delivers as always, with a deep and gritty electronic vibe to his score, that brings a layer of much needed science fiction to the movie.
Arguably to remind us that we are indeed bearing witness to the birth of the greatest Hero of all time, but he's from space.

If cheesy comedy vibes, Sloppy uninspired character progression, pointless action sequences and an expendable cast is your thing, go watch the Avengers and Iron Man.

If Legends are more of your taste, I encourage you to go watch Man of Steel before it's reduced to a gap between fall and blu-ray christmas release."
"Jul 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Good action sequences. But no character development whatsoever, and I feel asleep. Also, I loved Amy Adams in Leap Year and other appropriate roles, but I don't think she should have been cast as Lois Lane."
"Jul 20, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Nice visuals, great looking special effects, but that's wrapped in a terrible story with gigantic plot holes and filled with scenes of just sheer stupidity. The character development is very forced and the interpersonal relationships make next to no sense. Disappointed & unimpressed"
"Jul 20, 2013",POSITIVE,a fresh reimagining and sometimes the world is a dark place.. enjoyed not having the humor and kissy kissy crap from the other superman movies
"Jul 20, 2013",POSITIVE,"The best Superman movie ever.  They finally got it right.  The casting was phenomenal.  Entertaining as a comic fan would like.  Finally, it's really Superman."
"Jul 20, 2013",POSITIVE,well done movie but I am a huge comic movie fan and this does not stand up to the advengers at all. action was well done and the villion was amazing! story was creative and unique. however it is a movie I wouldn't see twice.
"Jul 20, 2013",NEGATIVE,Its more like a Miracleman movie than a Superman movie
"Jul 20, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman of all.
"Jul 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,I would have liked it better if not for the flash backs.  Tell the story.  Also I feel it made the female solider at the end look silly and unprofessional
"Jul 20, 2013",POSITIVE,"In my opinion Zack Snyder hasn't made the best movies in his past such as Sucker Punch and even Watchmen isn't that great. Despite these past mishaps I was purely impressed with this movie. Although the amount of action takes away from getting to know Clark's personality the Snyder, Nolan duo incorporates many great aspects of Superman's past into the film. It helps you better understand the fate of Jor-El and his dying planet, as well as Clark's past on Earth. It takes a whole new light on the history of the Man of Steel and his beginnings. Sure there were some cliche lines and a bit more sci-fi than expected but overall the film went smoothly. Ultimately this movie was amazing and sets a new standard for DC comics movies just as the Batman trilogy did. Keep up the good work Zach!"
"Jul 20, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman I have seen.  I like the very small leads to the future of the series.
"Jul 20, 2013",POSITIVE,Its a Great dark story that was worth the money spent!
"Jul 20, 2013",POSITIVE,i have now seen the first two great superman movies i rate this 4/5
"Jul 20, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Pretty much hated it. The opening scene was way too long. Drifter Superman on the oil derrick was pretty cool (it was in the trailer), but there was nothing in the Clark/Pa Kent relationship that would suggest that young Clark would grow up to be the defender of truth, justice, and the American Way. The only reason Zod is on Earth, and the only reason for the wanton destruction and loss of millions of lives, is to chase after Kal-El, so if Kal-El hadn't been here, none of it would have happened. And the ending... This Superman reboot is irredeemable at this point."
"Jul 20, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Overly long, dark and not so much fun. Appreciated the amount of action, but it was wasted on a disjointed plot muddle with flashbacks."
"Jul 20, 2013",POSITIVE,could have had a better ending.
"Jul 20, 2013",POSITIVE,"De fato o personagem do Homem de a√ßo foi salvo gra√ßas a esse filme! At√© ent√£o a figura do super-homem parecia para mim um tanto como sem gra√ßa e sem poder cinematogr√°fico, apesar dos cl√°ssicos de 70, o super-homem deixava bastante a desejar. Ai que surge um novo filme, um novo her√≥i e foi isso o mais importante, a nova face do personagem para o cinema contempor√¢neo. Sem sombra de d√∫vidas, Henry Cavill representa esse personagem muito bem. E o que falar em rela√ß√£o a  Russel Crowe e Kevin? Ambos est√£o √≥timos, cada um com seu valor na trama! Fora isso, acho que Zack e Nolan acertaram em cheio, claro que poderia ser bem melhor, com algumas modifica√ß√µes e cuidados minuciosos.. Entretanto, o filme n√£o perde for√ßa nem qualidade, mas de fato, est√° longe de ser um filme perfeito! Mas que agora  o personagem do homem de a√ßo reviveu para minha pessoa gra√ßas a Man of Steel.. bem, isso √© um fato."
"Jul 20, 2013",POSITIVE,A really great visual movie. But when going in to it you need to have an open mind to superman.
"Jul 20, 2013",NEGATIVE,I was disappointed with this movie. The special effects had me thinking I would see Will Smith punch an alien I'm the face.
"Jul 20, 2013",POSITIVE,absolutely amazing movie!  if u haven't seen it dk it now.
"Jul 20, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This movie was okay.  It was interesting to learn about Superman's back story, but there were some definite holes in the story line.  The relationship with Ms. Lane was completely underdeveloped,  and the fight scenes were too long & drawn out. Also most all of the character development was absent.  Overall it was an okay Action flick,  but not much else."
"Jul 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Better than Thor (of the same season).
Not much of a plot, but at least it had a plot, a coherent one at that, between all the bouts of destruction.
Surprisingly good..I had low expectations. They were made even late because I had expected to like it less than Thor, which I found to be terrible. so by the time I saw Superman.. well, it was good. for some mindless entertainment, go ahead, and enjoy."
"Jul 20, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Unfotunately, other than a cool opening on Krypton, it was pretty weak.  General Zod loses his malevolent, crazed look the more he talks, and once he puts on Cat Woman's body suit for the final battle."
"Jul 20, 2013",NEGATIVE,"An enjoyable film, a lot of action and in the end I would say to much. A new take on the boy scout in his blue and red tights and had some fun moments but its change of tone really took me out of the film, casting was great and his origin was told nicely 
2.5/5"
"Jul 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Wasn't fussed by the film, soundtrack, amazing!"
"Jul 20, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I did enjoy the film but I think if your a hardcore superman fan you will be disappointed. As a film on its own it is quite good, not one you would be desperate to see twice in the cinema, but as part of the huge superman story it is a bit of a let down. It was well acted and directed and I like how flashbacks merged with the present and the fight scenes but I did think some scene like at the artic was too long as well as some of the flashback scenes. I would say to you to go see this film but don't make your expectations too high."
"Jul 20, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The worst movie I've seen this year, and I'm addicted to chick flics. Everything that can go wrong goes wrong. Let's just say the only decent thing in the whole movie is Superman's suit.

The first 30 minutes are all about Krypton. They're boring, but you can make the effort and watch it. Then there's just 2 hours of flashbacks and fast forwards and crazy shit that makes no sense.

Clark barely speaks. He just has this look of ""I'm different and that makes me sad"". Lois Lane is the most annoying, badly written character I've EVER seen. EVER. And I've watched 3 season of Glee.

There's at least 60 minutes of war in which there's just explosions and the characters keep contradicting themlseves. Zod's team says they don't have moral standards. Then Zod says they're killing everybody because that's what's right. HELLO?!?!?! You either have morals or you don't!
Zod wants Superman, and he agrees to be captured... and suddenly Zod also wants Lois. Why? No logical reason.

Over 2 hours of nonsense like that. Over and over and over and over again. They didn't even try to make sense. They didn't even try to have decent characters. They didn't write a good line or scene. 

It's not worth anybody's time nor money."
"Jul 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,best opening of a movie ever I would have been happy with a two hour movie with supermans dad ridding a dragon
"Jul 20, 2013",POSITIVE,This was a great flick! Got to love Superman!
"Jul 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I thought that this movie was waaaay over the top. Being a Superman fan since a young age, I prefer the original movies with Christopher Reeve. This remake was too sci-fi/fantasy for me. And I thought the plot could have been executed better. There were flashbacks that were not in chronological order, which made the movie a little more confusing and hard to follow. And there was too much focus on Superman's past, and not enough focus on how he actually began to be Superman. It just all the sudden shows that he wants to be superman one day. And the way they introduced Clark Kent? Made no sense, that was disappointing. I didn't like the way they remade this, should have stuck to more of the original format. I like some of the new twists added, but overall was too much. The action was ridiculous and cheesy. Rather disappointed, I had high hopes for this movie."
"Jul 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,"very boring , a way to long sit"
"Jul 13, 2013",POSITIVE,I feel really bad for the people of New York because during this movie every single building in NYC is destroyed. I'm surprised they didn't have Superman throw General Zod into the statue of liberty. Overall it was a great movie.  Love the Krypton scenes because that is a side of the superman saga you rarely see. Ending was perfect and I predict in the sequel that Superman will never kill again.
"Jul 13, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie. Very excited for the sequel.
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"A whole different take on Superman with a much darker tone and a touch of realism. Great action sequences, excellent music and a very complete story telling of the Superman mythology. Definitely buying it on Blu-Ray."
"Jul 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,"For the most part, it was a decent movie, but growing up with Reeve as Superman, I couldn't deal with a shakeup. Way too much destruction, and the origin was not correct, along with the relationship with Lois Lane. Not much dialogue at all."
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,Besides a bearded superman this movie added nothing to perception of superman.
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,My favorite Superman film since Superman II!!
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Was ok, expected a bit more I guess. The action scenes were great, some points of the story I didn't like. Casting was good liked Russell Crowe as Jor El."
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,can t wait for the justice league
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"People/critics complaining about this movie being too ""serious"" need to get a clue. It's 2013 for Christ's sake. Overly campy comic books are a thing of the past. That being said I did get a little weary from all the explosions and destruction. Also, the product placements could have been toned down a bit. That being said, it's pretty enjoyable. Nothing that special though."
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The first trailer advertised this as a film that would deeply explore the origins of Superman through what seemed to be beautiful sequences. This was supposed to change all concepts of a remake, but it didn't. The potential was definitely there to make a meaningful, yet powerful statement with the film, but Snyder ultimately makes this to satisfy a niche fan base. The only thing epic about the film were the fight scenes, and they seemed to run a bit long. Adams was not a convincing Lane at all. Cavill was a good Man of Steel but I can't say he's the ONLY man that could pull it off, not like RDJ's Tony Stark."
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,Not bad. A lot longer than it needed to be and the last fight scene was very unnecessary .
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Es dif√É¬≠cil poder sustituir al Superman interpretado magistralmente por Christopher Reeve pero esta historia es emocionante, diferente sin perder lo b√É¬°sico y el actor es estupendo"
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Many effects for a regular movie. Superman is Christopher Reeves, no other..."
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"SCOTT:  Well, Greg, the Man of Steel just flew into town.

GREG: And boy are his arms tired. Let's review.

SCOTT:  The movie begins with the planet Krypton facing imminent destruction as its core disintegrates.  Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and his wife Lara (Ayelet Zurer) plan to save their race of people by launching their infant son, Kal-El, into space with a genetic codex of Kryptonians.  General Zod (Michael Shannon), however, has other plans and kills Jor-El for stealing the codex.  As punishment, Zod is exiled. Meanwhile, Kal-El lands on earth and is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), who name him Clark (Henry Cavill).  They witness Clark's superpowers and discourage him from using them them so that he will fit into human society.

GREG:  Clark grows into a man and hides by staying on the run and taking odd jobs. Everywhere he goes, he saves someone using his super powers. And each time he exposes himself, he moves on. Clark finds an abandoned Kryptonian ship that he brings to life with a key that was found on his person when he first fell to Earth. An avatar of Jor-El (Russell Crowe) explains to Clark that he is to be a protector of humankind and to use his powers for only good.

Meanwhile, evil Zod has escaped from his prison and found his way to Earth...

SCOTT:  Greg, I have mixed feelings about Man of Steel.  On the positive side, there is more detailed backstory than we've ever seen before in a Superman movie, and it is very good.  We learn about the man of steel's home planet of Krypton and its political and planetary struggles.  The movie features an excellent villain in General Zod (Michael Shannon) and a sweet love interest in Lois Lane (Amy Adams).  We also see Superman receiving superb mentoring from three sources:  his biological father Jor-El, and his adopted parents Martha Kent (Diane Lane) and Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner).

Another aspect of the film that I liked was the old-school code of ethics that so many of the characters seemed to live by.  Lois has the story of the century for the Daily Planet but pulls the story for ethical reasons.  Superman's adopted father sacrifices his life to allow his son Clark to retain his secret identity.  Even General Zod, in a ruthlessly warped way, has an honorable motive in trying to preserve the race of Kryptonians.

GREG: I thought this was a much more thorough and thoughtful origin story than we've ever seen for Superman. He is portrayed as not just an alien, but alienated from the rest of humanity. Surely. this is a feeling most of us have felt. He has to hide his amazing gifts for fear of what it would mean if humans realized we are not alone in the universe. And he is given a choice to use his powers for good or for evil. It is his earthly father who guides him toward the path of goodness. And it is this father who sacrifices himself to protect Clark's secret. These are two emotional traumas that give this Superman more depth of character than any who came before him.

SCOTT:  I agree, Greg,  But I do have a few issues with Man of Steel that prevent me from giving it a higher rating.  While there are incredible CGI effects illustrating Superman's speed and strength, these effects are used to bloated excess.  It's as if the filmmakers were so madly in love with their computerized effects that they decided that more - and MUCH more -- is always better.  How many fight scenes do we need to see between Superman and General Zod?  And we must ask ourselves:  Does it really make sense for two indestructible beings to fight at all?  Don't they each realize that repeatedly slamming each other through skyscrapers is not having the intended effect?  The fighting grew tiresome.

Another problem I had with the film was the absurd way that Superman's battle with General Zod was resolved.  I won't give away the ending, but let's just say that if you look up the word 'anticlimactic' in the dictionary, you'll see an image of this scene in the movie.  The word 'illogical' also comes to mind, as we're expected to forget the massive violence of their earlier fighting that both characters easily survived.

GREG:  I would have to differ with you on the special effects, Scott. For a movie this long (2hrs and 23 minutes) I thought the special effects were used to good effect and in good proportion. The fight scenes were constantly underscored by Superman's restraint as a man who resorted to violence only as a last resort. And as a man who had never killed anyone, at least as far as this movie showed us. Superman's greatest weakness was the strong desire to protect the people of Earth - not only as a group, but as individuals.

My only complaint about Man Of Steel was Lois Lane. Amy Adams came of as very cute, perky, and as a tough journalist. She was perfect in that respect. But this reboot has Lois Lane aware of Superman's secret identity. One of the hallmarks of Supermen gone by has been the sexual tension within the Clark-Lois-Superman love triangle. I'm not sure I understand why that was dropped.

SCOTT: The decision to reveal Clark's identity to Lois is a curious one, for sure. I didn't mind it too much, but now that you mention it, this revelation does limit what this version of Superman does with the two characters in the future.

Man of Steel is an ambitious film that works on several levels but fails on several as well.  It succeeds in portraying Superman's origin story in heartfelt detail and with a superb cast that moves us.  The movie fails by subjecting us to incessant fight-and-chase scenes and by ending the story in a ridiculous and baffling manner.  I give Man of Steel 3 Reels out of 5.

The hero's journey is commendable in that we have many of the classic elements that we look for in a good story, such as Kal-El's entry into a new and dangerous world and his encounter with effective father figures, mentors, and a love interest.  But I'm not convinced that Superman undergoes any significant transformation as a character.  Clark Kent seems to be the same Clark Kent at the end that he was when he was a little boy.  I give the movie 3 Heroes out of 5.

GREG:  I found Man of Steel to be an excellent reboot of the Superman franchise. It held true to the original story and fleshed out the hero's backstory. We met a Superman who was less than flawless, tormented and challenged. Compared to Christopher Reeve's Superman, Henry Cavill's story is less campy and much more adult. This is a darker Superman which I welcome. I appreciated this more than the almost giddy mood of last May's Star Trek Into Darkness. Still, I don't feel the need to rush back to the theater and get a second helping. I give Man of Steel 4 out of 5 Reels.

The hero's journey is there. Clark starts out as an outcast, uncertain about his powers and all alone even in a crowd. With the guidance of his Earthly father and his Kryptonian father's image he finds his center and emerges whole and confident in his abilities and his place on the Earth. I give Clark Kent 4 out of 5 Heroes."
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man Of Steel, although not a masterpiece like the original from 1978, it is still a powerful film, thanks to the superb performance of Henry Cavill, closely resembling Reeve (more than Brandon Routh). Nevertheless, it has a few flaws: the pacing at first is fast although it balances throughout the rest of the film and a few areas went unexplored. The music by Hans Zimmer, although grand, marvelous and ingenious (as all Zimmer's compositions) it has nothing (except for the ending credits theme) remarkable like John Williams legendary score (Zimmer admitted that he knew he would not surpass Williams compositions). But don't be discouraged nor for the critics who are stabbing it, it is a worth-watching film and the deserved comeback for Superman to the cinemas (unlike Superman Returns)."
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A decent reboot, but not enough to make Marvel step up their game. The difference between Marvel and DC is that we get to enjoy Marvel's superheroes actually BE superheroes. It seems that DC is obsessed with every film being an origin story, or the superhero wanting to retire. Like Batman Begins and Dark Knight. There was a little too much origin story, and not enough Smallville in this movie. Fans of the comic understand the difference, and significance of Lana, which this movie just glosses over. This could be a decent start, and it was MUCH better than the last installment of the Superman series. The low expectations is the only reason I give this movie 3 and a half stars and not 2 and a half."
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"disappointing, but not as boring as Superman Returns."
"Jul 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,They had me up until superman and zod destroyed the ENTIRE f****g city.  Then the movie ends with everyone right back in the Daily Planet office talking about a basketball game like the ENTIRE city wasn't just destroyed.  F+ Don't see a sequel for this one either.
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Usually, I tend to agree with the Tomatometer, but not this time. Not at all."
"Jul 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,This movie was not a great movie it was an ok movie. It was way too long and it seems to be a trend now to make movies 2 and half hours long but that doesnt make it better. The action moves too quick in this which makes it all look fake and computer generated not to mention headache inducing. It relies on special effects instead of a great story like many action films. Iron man and avengers were great comic book movies but this one is just average. Save your money and rent it since going to the movies is overpriced.
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Much better than I expected.
"Jul 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,"You don't expect much from a movie like this and you don't get it.  The script has some interesting concepts but they are drowned in relentless explosions, crashes, and CGI testosterone.  I walked out.  Don't make the mistake of walking in."
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"*sighs* Could've been better, but it's acceptable compared to previous Superman films."
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Saw it three times in the theater!  When two characters with these super powers fight, THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN! Utter destruction makes me happy"
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"with regards to future Superman movies, there's no way the special effects could get any better than this!"
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,It was a great movie. Look forward to seeing the next movie.
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Man of Steel is such a great action packed movie!
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Great Superman film...hopefully more to come off this film
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,much better than the previous Superman movie.  Would have liked it a little less serious though and more clark kent
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It's well acted with some awesome visual/special effects. And I did feel some of the actors as there characters. Unfortunately, it's plot is slightly rushed, and the decision to have Louis Lane know about Superman's identity from the start didn't help. Either way, it's heart is in the right place, and Amy Adams, Henry Cavill,and Michael Shannon are quite effective in their roles."
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,Visually fantastic! Zodd..... trying to hard to act evil and what's up with almost lisp? Editing is all over the shop and character development well its there a little bit. Hopefully they learn from their mistakes and the make a better sequel! Not bad though!
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie and how they tired to tell the story of a boy growing up with these powers, yet trying to keep them hidden out of a justified fear from humanity.  I still hate how these new story tellers have to change some of the fundamental principles of the character just to ""keep the story fresh"" what is wrong with tradition?"
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Lacked a little development on Superman's part but the graphics and story line were amazing! Great character moments, battle scenes, and non stop action at a believable pace. Brought a tear to my eye too. Would see again."
"Jul 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,to much non stop fighting.
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,great job making the up bringing and back ground of superman look real and sad...krypton was so creative...love it...
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Why does an action movie have to have humor and be smothered in romance.  This is easily going to be one of the best movies of this year.  A must see in theaters and an accurate representation of  how Superman would fight off other super human beings.
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,This was Zack's Snyder's best movie that i've seen so far. Sucker punch was ok and Watchmen was the worst. The first half was kind of slow and i didn't like that sci-fi theme at the beginning of the film. The action scenes were good but i think they went a little overboard in the CG stuff and made it god awful. Overall man of steel was enjoying to see once.
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel is a great movie. It is better than Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Yes, it could've had more humor, and it's not tailored for kids. But, this movie is the best Superman movie ever! Sometimes it's good to take a character based on a comic book and turn that character into a real world character in a movie. Sorry comic book lovers, but it's the truth."
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A stylish reinvention of the Superman character than gets bogged down at times by frantic, monotonous spectacle. One of the movie's strongest points point is how compellingly it conveys the theme of fathers, sons, and hope for a better future. Some imagery in the movie is very striking and creates a strong sense of atmosphere, showing small town Americana as a backdrop for alien invasion. But at other times the special effects just feel garish and overproduced, while the pacing and some dialogue about the titular character's place in the world are occasionally clunky and clumsy. 

On the whole the cast are all very good in their roles. Henry Cavill does what he can with a somewhat sparse role, his Superman often feels a little too benevolent to be relatable, but is engaging in his more introspective moments and charismatic when embracing his heroic persona. Amy Adams plays Lois Lane as more as a persistent observer and window for the audience than a passive love interest. Michael Shannon is effective enough as a relentless alien invader, but brings some added conviction to the villain in his rare moments of worry and turmoil. Kevin Costner is well cast as the  adoptive father, giving a sense of sincerity to this movie's take on him as a sort of philosopher-farmer. But the strongest performance of the movie comes from Russell Crowe as Superman's alien father, bringing a sense of wisdom and passion to the part."
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"The Man of Steel is DC Comic's answer to all of Marvel's action packed movies. Don't expect this movie to be similar to The Dark Knight series, because it fall short, instead take it for the great action sequences it was intended for."
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,The best 2013 movie so far...
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie was and is amazing! Henry delivered the perfect and amazing acting in his role, while pulling off a perfect American accent as well.  √¢??√¢??√¢??√¢??√¢??√¢??√¢??√¢??√¢??√¢??"
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Awesome! it was a completely different take on superman but it still fit into the ""facts"" about him. I loved it!"
"Jul 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,This movie is too fake for me.
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Movie Review - Man of Steel. Contrary to any naysayers, this was a decent movie and definitely overshadowed its predecessor.

The effects were stunning, the action sequences pretty cool, and the actors ranged from OK to pretty good. In addition, it was an interesting take on the origin story and how the characters interacted or met each other. The movie was much more cohesive than Iron Man 3, even with the style of storytelling.

Unfortunately, the movie was way too long, and often took the form of drawn-out introspective drama interspersed with major action sequences. You could feel Snyder's touch in this movie, with it's camera angles and editing that gave it the feel of an ""artsy"" film rather than a summer blockbuster. On top of that, the plot had some noticeable holes that you need to look past to enjoy.

On a five-point scale, I give it a 3.5, and recommend it to other moviegoers. Unless you're really picky, you should enjoy it."
"Jul 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,Shaky Cam and no real heart.
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,loved it...best Superman ever
"Jul 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Henry Cadvill is Superman, hands down. And the action was pretty cool too! However, it's pretty slow-placed and there was a little bit of cheesy dialogue. Everything else was either pretty good or just amazing."
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Certes il y a des longueurs mais le film nous donne une version tr√®s r√©ussie du personnage de Superman, classe et attachant. J'ai ador√© la BO au passage"
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,Definitely better than the last Superman film and I actually felt like they were trying to give him a decent back story.  I think my biggest problem though is i just don't like Superman!
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,My favorite superman movie yet!
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Freaking awesome!!!!
"Jul 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,not a great movie. a fail to bad they tried to do the story in the batman format.
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Is this the Superman people are used to seeing? of course not! that superman was lame! He would fly around and be all ""justice this"" and ""justice that"" and he had no real personality. This superman has weaknesses, and a sense of purpose he's not happy about. This is a superman that is fun to watch. Every one of the poor reviews below say they don't like it because it's not happy like old superman, but I say that's so much better"
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,i found it very enjoyable. good 2013 version of Super Man
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The first half was amazing.  It was a wonderfully compelling story developing, then it turned into a lot of building smashing.  It started to feel like Transformers.  I never thought I'd be disappointed with too much action, but they went a bit overboard with the CGI destruction."
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"After watching this different vision of Superman, I am not sure what film all the critics thought they were watching. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Yes, there was destruction on grand scale, but I saw it as necessary to prevent even more destruction and the end of all human life. So if asked, I will recommend it to anyone curious enough."
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"no matter what fans say, it's no dark knight."
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Reboot and new superman and Henry cavil is the perfect selection to portray superman and I also give credit for putting superman in a different but darker direction
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"fast paced and full of energy, man of steel always has so much to look at, and the concentration on the science fiction aspect is what kept me engaged, though perhaps not much variety for fans of other genre other than sci fi and action.

its nice to see the focus more on the origin of superman and to see things more from his point of view rather than the tale we know already.  
in the 'story before the story' i noticed that the romantic aspect of superman that is often, in my opinion, focused on too heavily was a minimal factor, indicated with simple undertones of glances and gestures, and i found my eyes open to the relationships with other characters, such as his earth parents, which i found to be more emotion striking. 

for those expecting a remake of previous films or the old cliches there will be dissapointment as it does mix it up a bit, but i dont see that as a negative thing."
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,It really was an interesting movie. I really don't know why people hate it so much.
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"One of the best IMAX experiences I have ever had! WOW! Amazing movie overall! A must watch. The story was good, detailed and deep. The action was even better!"
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,One of the best superman movies on a long time
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Hearty pounding action, quick pace, and circumstantial plausibility fuel this gem!  Go see it,  scifi comicbook bliss!"
"Jul 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Everybody is so mixed on this film, but in my opinion I hated this movie. I found the plot all over the place, and I couldn't connect with our main role at all. The supporting cast was bland and uninteresting to add to that. The action was great, but there was way too much mindless destruction going on for me to enjoy it. This movie just doesn't have the heart the original does."
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"glorious visual enhancements and enjoyable drama, but the transitions between each sequence were rather flat and the overkilling action scenes were somehow exhausting to look at. seeing it on IMAX 3D just made it worse.. well, at least for me."
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Felt a little rushed but it was very good
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Very good movie, well done. I heard there was a hint towards a batman tie in but I didn't see it?  Was it half way through the credits or did they cut it from the theater version?"
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Almost no issue with it, except for the ending scene
My favorite Superman film"
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,It is worth watching. I agree the 1978 film is the best.
"Jul 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Sadly this movie was just filled with horrible effects, video game style fight scenes,  unnecessary violence.. and a superman that just didn't care that he aided in killing THOUSANDS of people by not leading the battles away from Metropolis.  

The main story lines of Superman and Zod were done well, but lois was useless and found the whole tornado scene with his dad to be ridiculous.   

I could write more but I just don't care to.  I left the theatre extremely disappointed."
"Jul 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,continue watching the original superman until a proper remake appears in the box office.
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie was sooooooooo good I didn't notice one thing wrong with it.
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Barely over the ""fresh"" threshold for me.  Superman has been done and redone and I guess I'm just tired of it all.  I wish DC would have developed the other Justice League characters all along and we might be looking at  JL movie in the next year or two.  As it stands now, Supes has yet to meet Batman.   GL was a good movie but Wonder Woman, Hawkman, Aquaman, Flash, et. al.....good grief, 2021 might see a JL movie.  All of the old school Superman fans will be deceased by then :("
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the critics, this movie finally provides the Superman movie you've been looking for. If you've been disappointed by the campy, hammy, just plain awful other Superman movies, this flick is for you."
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie! If you like Superman even just a little bit, you will love the movie!"
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,What a great reinterpretation of a great saga. This film made me fall in love with Supes all over again
"Jul 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,"it started off great, the first half was a brilliant coming of age type film, liked the back story. second half was really dull, endless seemingly invincible beings smashing everything around them. superman not trying to protect the innocent whatsoever, more focussed on smashing the city to bits.  I was really disappointed, it started so well, but I think it missed the mark."
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome movie! I loved all the special effects.
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This latest version of the popular superhero is directed by Zack Snyder, produced by Christopher Nolan, and scripted by David S. Goyer. Of course, we all know that is based on the DC Comics character Superman, and this time we have the origin story. Superman this time is Henry Cavill and Amy Adams is his sweetheart Lois Lane, while we find Michael Shannon as General Zod, Diane Lane as Martha Kent, Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent, Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, and Russell Crowe as Jor-El, Superman's real father. About acting a little bit later. First I'd like to start with the feeling about this movie: everything was done the best possible way and still something wasn't right. I like the new design of the Superman's outfit, the dark tones of the cinematography, perfect CGI... and still it felt like watching an old guy with a wonderful young lady using Viagra... maybe it's up, but not by itself, and just didn't feel right. My opinion is that it is a fault of the screenplay writers - they wanted so much but at the end started cutting corners which cost them dynamics and flow of the action. The plot of Man of Steel employs a nonlinear narrative, and tells parts of the story in flashback and that could result in a disaster if the writers are not careful. During story discussions for The Dark Knight Rises in 2010, David S. Goyer told Christopher Nolan his idea on how to present Superman in a modern context and that is how both of them were hired to finish it based on the financial and critical success of The Dark Knight. For me, that was a mistake. Superman is not Batman and what works in one movie didn't work for the other. Lack of rhythm was evident and the too much destruction was sometimes simply replaced with flat-footed homilies! 

Still, I cannot say it is a bad movie. It was too long, but I am glad I had the origin story told, not the perfect way, but not too bad either, letting us know better the super hero we thought we know well already. Sequel is on the way!"
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies DC has ever put out!  In my opinion much better than any of the Dark Knight franchise.  They made some changes, some were cool others seemed unneed."
"Jul 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,Yikes! Does superman have any personality?
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,A very manly Superman right Dr the start.
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Man of Steel packs quite a wallop. There's plenty to like, but by the time we reach the the last half-hour it's hard to shake the sense that this was an opportunity partially missed. While it gives you your fix, it doesn't put Superman back on top of our cinematic superheroes. The good and grand things outnumber the bad, but the film works as hard as it can to keep that from being the case."
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"From Watchmen director Zack Snyder and produced by The Dark Knight trilogy director Christopher Nolan, Superman swoops back into big screen action in the brand new release, Man of Steel, with Henry Cavill donning the red cape and taking on the role of the superhero.
 
Man of Steel is an origin story of Superman's humble beginnings to heroic icon. It tells the story of how he came to Earth escaping the dying planet Krypton, his struggles as a young boy with his super human powers and how as an adult he learns to harness them and protects his adoptive planet from an onslaught of exiled intergalactic baddies, intent of destroying him and all mankind.
 
The casting is excellent with Henry Cavill as the lead and Suoerman's alter ego Clark Kent, and a wonderfully boggle-eyed Michael Shannon as General Zod, Superman's nemesis. They are superbly supported by a host of acclaimed talent including Diane Lane and Kevin Costner as the Superman's Earth parents who take him in and Russell Crowe as his real father, the biblically bearded Jor-El. Amy Adams plays Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane.
 
The set pieces are massive, inventive, and visually stunning but as often with CGI driven third acts, the animated carnage as Superman Man and General Zod go about it like two Greek Gods demolishing down Metropolis, gets a little tiresome.
 
Man of Steel is a spectacular reboot of the Superman franchise and is arguably the greatest of all Superman movies."
"Jul 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Really a better updated version. It has grand production, great action and effects. Movie start off with Ayelet Zurer giving birth to future Superman and daddy Russell Crowe helps her. Their planet is dying and he is meeting the councils. Michael Shannon lead his rogue army to overthrow them with Antje Traue as deputy. Russell escape and retrieve the codecs of which Michael also want. Their baby is the first natural born in a century. So far the babies are genetic made with purpose impose on individual. They gonna send their baby to another planet and Russell fight Michael. The latter killed Russell while he is distracted. The baddies are surrounded and sentence to frozen imprisonment into the phantom zone. Michael swear he will find the baby. The planet Krypton erupts. The baby ship crash to Earth. Fast forward to Henry Cavill working on a fish trawler and was told to get back as an oil rig ahead is going to explode. Henry go and save the people stuck there to the helipad. As a boy he suddenly have Xray vision and heighten hearing. Diane Lane teach him to focus. During a bus trip, the wheel dislodge and fell into a lake. Everyone is trap and drowning. Young boy save them all. Kevin Costner want him to keep his power a secret all this time because he think people are not ready for such things. He show the boy the ship he came into and also a metal piece. Henry work various job and often use fake names and also not long due to troubles. Amy Adams drop in the Artic region as the military found a relic under the ice. She follow Henry who explore the relic which is the ship of his kind. An alien bot attack her and Henry save her. He activated the ship with the metal piece and the AI Russell brief the history to Henry. He got the suit and must embrace his powers. The sun made him stronger. Amy want to publish what she see but her boss Laurence Fishburne decline. So she ask a friend to post it online and do her own investigation to track down Henry. At Kevin's grave, Henry approach her and told her why she must not reveal. The family were arguing in the car and a twister is approaching. Kevin wants everyone to hide under a bridge and he go save the family dog but leg is trap. Henry wanted to save him but Kevin want him to stay and he died. So Henry wants to honor his words and think human are not ready yet. Amy want to retract her decision but the online news cause big hooha. The military detected an alien ship approaching Earth and soon it hack into the broadcast and announce they want their kind hiding on Earth to surrender. FBI capture Amy for she know who is this person. Henry decided to surrender for mankind and exchange for Amy safety even though he don't trust Michael. The General Harry Lennix arrange the handing over. Antje descend and now want Amy to follow too. The Colonel Christopher Meloni refuses but she decides to follow. Up at the spaceship Henry is weaken as he isn't use to the force of Krypton. He secretly give Amy the metal piece. Amy is lock in a cell and she insert the metal and activate AI Russell, who guide her how to escape and send the baddies back to phantom zone. Henry breaks free after the spaceship force is deactivated by Amy. She escape in a pod but crashing. Henry rush to save her. Michael visit the farm house and Diane is bullied. Henry fly in and fight Michael, meantime his helmet breaks and he is overwhelm by the noises and vision. Antje and another fights Henry and Michael retreats. Their fights is devastating and epic. The air force led by Christopher is attacking them. The baddies easily crush them. Only Christopher is left to fight Antje and Henry save him. The air force drop a missile at her and win. Michael bring her back to the ship. Now the military recognize Henry as the good guy. Michael got to know the codecs are embedded inside the cells of Henry and so begin to launch the planet changing plan to wipeout all Earthlings. Two ships are launch at opposite zone to create gravity force suitable for them. The city is destroy badly by the force. Amy tell the general she know how to destroy the baddies. They must activate the ship that Henry came from and launch it to crash the baddies, this will create the wormhole to bring them back to phantom zone. Henry alone try to destroy the machine that is doing the changes. But without sunlight it proves hard. He persevere and manage to destroy it. The air force can't destroy the spaceship due to the force. Antje go on board the plane to attack. Michael override the ship AI control and drive his own destroyer jet. The metal piece can't be inserted to the ship because AI is override. The scientist manage to put it in. Christopher crash the plane towards the spaceship and they all go to the wormhole. Amy is thrown out and Henry save her in time. Michael crash his ship and is very furious. He fight Henry and both are too powerful. Henry strangle him and he is gonna kill some people with his laser eyes. Henry have no choice but twist his neck and kills him. Amy comforts him. Henry decide to work at Daily Planet and wear a spec.."
"Jul 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,Total disappointment. This movie diverted from the original concept of fighting the villains product of modern times. Instead we witness aliens fighting each other on Earth like in many other movies before.
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,The graphics and special effects wear amazing. Story and character development lacked greatly.
"Jul 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Terribly Dissapointing, The Man of Steel while being better than Superman Returns lacks so much it's almost embarrassing. Without the little backstory elements (which might I add were all over the place) this wouldn't have been as good as it would have been. Michael Shannon might seem like a good Zod to some bit overall He's so underdeveloped as a character I hardly care what he does or what happens to him, same goes with Laurence Fishbournes character and the other news people who work at the Daily Planet, they're just there Zach Snyder spends way to much time on the explosions rather than then the plot development. Overall I like Henry Cavill as Superman and I liked Amy Adams as a more independent Lois Lane, and the emding does show a lot of promise for a better sequel but overall Man of Steel is just an average popcorn flick bolstered by a lot of explosions and laser beams"
"Jul 11, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It wasn't god awful, it had some good moments, however it just seemed short of entertaining for a superman movie, and I had more moments of wondering if they could just get on with a scene more often then not."
"Jul 11, 2013",NEUTRAL,"While it wasn't bad, it wasn't great either. The characters where very quickly introduced and you may find yourself siding with Zod more than the man of steel. It was the best modern attempt at superman (no 1978 is NOT modern); however it was Christopher Reeves that brought the role to the masses. Great addition to Superman History."
"Jul 11, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Well been awhile since I reviewed a movie on here.  Ive seen alot movies since then ... maybe I should catch up!  This reboot of 1979 classic had a splash of the 1st 2 movies.  I really liked how they went to the darker side, more cutting edge Superman, but along the way they lost the magic.  Sure there was alot of kick ass fight scenes and explosions ... but to be honest ... that's about it.  

For the origin of Superman and how landed on earth ... they played on the flashbacks instead of telling the whole story.  Not too bad, but there was not enough character building ... it was like he was born, landed on earth ... and became Superman right away.  Enter the main protagonist ... General Zod.  He was pretty evil and played a good part, but a few things struck me while watching this flick.  1)  Why repeat the same music over and over again ... cool at 1st, but after that ... those drums started to really get on my nerves. 2) How did Lois Lane learn to fight, and shoot an alien laser gun with ease? and 3) General Zod had the same powers as Superman ... and they really kicked the shit out of each other ...and did things to each other that would kill anyone human, but after enduring all that physical punishment ... SPOILER ALERT ... Superman kills Zod by snapping his neck ... WTF?? LOL  

All in all, given some of the minor flaws in this movie ... I liked it, but it didn't even come close to the original!  See it for yourself and u decide!"
"Jul 11, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Even though I had issues with many of the changes in the Superman mythos; you had to expect that from the Superman nerd that I am. The film as amazing action sequences coupled with engaging leads that won me over in the long run. I think I rated this film a bit higher just because of anticipation for the sequel, as I feel M.O.S. left  a few unanswered questions that left me quite intrigued."
"Jul 11, 2013",NEGATIVE,Great the first time unwatchable the second time
"Jul 11, 2013",POSITIVE,"The Man of Steel movie is a near-perfect vision of Superman, it has great action, good character development and excellent performances, people think that there is no love, it's because they are leaving it for the sequel, they say Superman wouldn't kill, but he would do what ever to protect mankind, and he did it in this movie, I never saw the original because I found it boring and this one is full of action and great effects, a must see for Superman fans, and critics think Superman Returns was better, don't listen to them
4.9/5"
"Jul 11, 2013",POSITIVE,went and saw this in 3d with my hubby and it was great! lots of action and great story line!
"Jul 11, 2013",POSITIVE,"Very action packed and interesting. Yet, makes the revision of superman exciting with a new twist."
"Jul 11, 2013",NEGATIVE,non-stop biff n bam...... so much so it becomes a bore....
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Eh, it was ok. Shaky camera in some parts of the movies. A fight scene that seemed to never end. The orignial Superman movie was better."
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Didn't thrill me, although it wasn't the director's fault.  I actually thought Zack Snyder did some pretty interesting stuff in his take on Superman.  I guess maybe Superman is just a tough character to relate to, especially with all of the contemporary versions of superheroes on film.  He's not troubled and gritty.  He has crazy powers.  His cast of villains (at least in this film) are decidedly one-note.  And I had some issues with the events at the conclusion of this story, although I don't want to give anything away.  This pales in comparison to Nolan's Dark Knight movies, although I am curious to see how they're going to wrangle a Justice League movie out of these characters."
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,A very cool mix of sci-fi and the super hero genre.
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The movie screams ""big budget"" - plenty of exciting action scenes with extraordinary CGI. Story though is lacking, almost unfinished. While it opens strong and leaves an unforgettable impression about the father's death, the momentum doesn't carry on."
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,It was a  good movie but i didnt really understand it
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Why does Hollywood keep going back to the origins of Superman for our movies?  There are literally thousands of Superman comics to draw from, why not try something actually new and exciting??  We've seen this story before, again and again, and I was very bored this time around.  Seriously, Hollywood, color outside the lines once in awhile!"
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,"i enjoyed this i guess. the story was pretty striped down, not a lot of character development and it's kind of sad that superman had to become a ""dark"" character to be popular again... says something about who we are as a people these days."
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,Great special effects. Good story.  Excellent soundtrack.  Only complaint is the length of the final seen.
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The first scene is nothing less than spectacular, would have liked a lot more Krypton, but that it's a different movie. Overal lots of action with some story scenes crammed in. Almost makes superman relatable - but then that suit comes out and it all falls apart. Then there are a lot more action scenes."
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"After seeing this film, I don't understand why a lot of people have so much negativity to this film. I thought it was the best Superman movie I've seen so far."
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"The best use of the Superman franchise in film since the older films way back then, visually and story-wise. A perfect way to start off a DC Cinematic Universe, even without The Dark Knight Rises. Just make sure you're okay with long movies feeling long."
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,its a great movie...dunno y its takin so much heat
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,An Interesting new take on the decades old franchise.
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Disappointing, to say the least.  Too many liberties taken in this reboot that just don't work.  There is very little humor and the human elements of previous films are thrown aside in favor of more explosions and special effects."
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,Henry Cavill succeeded bringing a whole new version of the S-Man!  Huge action sequences.  And to top it off... Kevin Costner... aaah memories
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"Much needed remake and much better than original, but still held to the main story line.  Excellently done."
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,awesome!  great action throughout.
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,Nothing terribly new. I wish the inner conflicts were better developed.
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Completely disappointing.  Kevin Costner plays a good part, but the rest....  I could have sustained the weak plot, but the completely overloaded, mindless action and destruction left me regretting that I'd bought my tickets.  Superman is supposed to be a figure of inspiration - yet the superman in Snyders group simply represents mindless might is right. This is not the superman I read in comics years ago.  Strongly recommend skipping this movie."
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Poignant human moments make this movie worth seeing. Special-effects-laden battle scenes become monotonous. Not Realistic: Clark Kent would never join the Daily Planet today, he would start his own blog!"
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"First off, do not believe what the critics are saying because this Superman movie is better than all the other versions combined. Because it is a Zack Snyder movie, I just knew it was going to be as visually appealing as some of his other stuff like ""Watchmen"" or ""300"" (and I was not let down). Now this ""retelling"" of the story is a little more sci-fi than what you would have read in the comics, but that is okay because this is 2013 (not 1933). I am tempted to write more but have decided that what I have already written should be sufficient. Enjoy! See it on the big screen!"
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Awesome effects, good storyline, but too many loud, boring fight scenes"
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,"A Superman film that starts out promisingly enough, but ultimately favors dull, redundant action and explosions over character, story and heart. I enjoyed Costner as Pa Kent and Russell Crowe as Jor-El. The rest of the cast did not have much to work with (a cheesy script with lame dialogue from David S. Goyer). This could've been something great, if the action actually had consequences and I cared about ANYONE in the movie. 2.5/5. Needed just a little bit more humor or brightness. So relentlessly grim and self-serious it becomes dull."
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,"*Spoilers*
If you can get past all the amazingly illogical stupid stuff, like ""lets solve this invasion problem by creating a quantum singularity (ie: black hole) to suck their ship into oblivion"" Because of course any black hole that is created would just automatically close on it's own as soon as the bad guys were sucked away, it wouldn't do something like say...swallow the solar system or the galaxy like real black holes actually do. Or brilliant moves like ""we colonized other worlds to exploit their resources, but then we abandoned our exploitation of resources on other planets for no apparent reason and went back to exploiting the resources on our own planet until it finally collapsed in on itself"". What? Why would you do that, you advanced species that, as you stated has existed for hundreds of thousands of years, why would you do something so obviously foolish?"
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This was horribly acted, some of the worst computer effects, Christopher Reeve did a  better job. There was no continuity between the real story and the movie...no fortress of solitude(it was a spaceship) what a waste of money and time !"
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"It was amazing!!!! I love Henry Cavill from The Tudors and he was awesome as Superman! Yes...the original is always the best of any Superman movie ever...but this one was good in a different way. The story was weak, but the action was beautiful and I wasn't sure about how the chemistry was going to be between Amy and Henry, but in the end I liked it."
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I didn't leave saying,  ""wow,  that was fun!"" rather,  I thought,  ""who was so in love with two people fighting *through* buildings and bashing each other in the face over and over and over again?"" Snyder or Nolan? Probably both. And,  why did putting on the suit suddenly give him a clean shave?"
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,fight scene way too long at the end.. and then so simple to kill the bad guy .. thumbs down
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,Can't wait to see this movie again! Truly amazing!
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Under this film's verbose and gauche airbrushed noise there is a great skeleton of a story that we can all relate to. The problem isn't the script, although it's not perfect, and it's not the concept itself, it's Zack Snyder's need to airbrush the fuck out of everything and try to make every scene, no matter what the content, seem important and grand. we don't need an epic version of someone making coffee, thanks.

this film could have been brilliant, if Snyder had let someone else take the reins. unfortunately, we'll probably have to suffer him a lot more."
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"La mejor pel√≠cula de superheroes de todos los tiempos! Logra sumar en una pel√≠cula toda la evoluci√≥n hasta nuestros d√≠as del mundo de Superman, con gran profundidad y desarrollo de los personajes, con un Clark Kent y Superman totalmente humano y una Loise Lane querible, no como la hist√©rica de Margot Kidder. Y una intro de Kript√≥n que es agradecida por cualquier fans de Superman. En resumen la m√°s √©pica pel√≠cula antes vista de Superman."
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed this. It was engaging, exciting, and fun, while keeping the emotion and heart bound in the real world."
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,DC sure can't do movies.  This was crapular.
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"I really loved this film! My son and I have seen it twice and we want to watch it again.

Call me a wuss but I cried at three different points of the film: when Papa Kent died, when Superman kills Zod, and when they show the flashback of a younger Clark acting like a superhero. I was probably emotional too because I watched it on Father's Day and I was overwhelmed with feelings that the movie triggered about my being a father myself and about my ill Dad who, at one point, I felt was my Hero. 

I was not bothered by the joyless tone of the movie because that was the intention of the writer and director. Besides, I am that way too and I find an emotional movie more affecting than a humorous movie. What do the others want, stupid humour like that of Transformers? You can't compare Man Of Steel with The Avengers either since they have their own niche.

I was not bothered that Superman killed Zod since he wanted to protect the humans. Didn't he kill in Superman II too? What made that different?

I also don't see anything wrong with Clark knowing how to become a hero so quickly, after all he has the genetic code of all of his race melded in him. To add to this, Jor El must've ""downloaded"" a whackload of information via the black S sliver.

The structure of the movie follows the structure of Titanic and Avatar where the characters are slowly developed in the first half 
and then all hell breaks lose in the 2nd half.

I don't see why people (and even geek and nerd bloggers) question the giant mecha-squid. It's a 'roided up and evil version of the mecha butlers found in the Kryptonian scenes and also found in the derelict ship.

Being a devout Catholic, I also loved the Christ references. I don't think you can ever do a Superman movie without including Messianic and Saviour themes: 

-El in Hebrew means God
-Jor El sends his only son to be a God among men
-Kal El will save them all (with matching crucifix imagery)
-I like the scene of Clark with the priest with the Agony In The Garden imagery behind him
-Jesus was 33 when he was crucified, Clark was 33

I also loved the subtle tribute to Christopher Reeve when he was momentarily inserted during the scene when Superman was about to go toward the beam of light. 

Everybody's entitled to an opinion and this is mine. I say go and watch it and enjoy it as many times as possible! Let's take this to 1 billion!"
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,Fantastic! A quasi-reboot that doesn't leave you comparing it previous iterations.
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Unfortunately I have 2 say , I was a bit disappointed , mayb because superman was always my fav & in this one he had no personality !!! Don't get me wrong, the movie was ok , even acting was good , but the writer should have written more about him , than his dad or planet , but kids loved it"
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"Sorry Christopher Reeve. But my goodness couldn't stop lusting at this new Superman. His body was out of this WORLD!! Ironic out of this world. His eyes were captivating.
Now, bout the movie. Awesome graphic, an fight scenes!!!"
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,A snore-a-thon until the fighting begins. Then hold on to your ass because it is about to be kicked.
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,"First, let me say that I wanted to love this movie.  Nothing good has happened to this franchise since Superman II with the last reboot and ""Superman 4: Superman versus His Nuclear Hair Follicle"" vying for worst script ever. But alas, if anything can be said in this movie's favor it is that it does not further tarnish the franchise.  The root issue with this movie is too much in too short a time.  It almost seems as if the  20+ minute opening fight scene and the 30+ minute final fight scene was the foundation around which everything had to fit.  By changing some of the more hokey facets of Superman lore, the script did make him a deeper, more interesting character; however, the most emotional and moving moments were rushed.  Unfortunately, DC comics,with the exception of the Dark Knight, never developed their characters much beyond the ""superhero"" persona; in other words, none of the JLA standouts have ever had a lot of depth as people.  So the idea of highlighting how terrible it must have been to grow up so afraid of what you were, what you can do and what people would think that it required great personal sacrifices to hide your true self.  But the flashback scenes interspersed haphazardly through the movie were not enough to sell the transformation from mistrusted freak to hero of humanity.  One last thing that just irked me to no end: suspensions of basic laws of physics.  This is the modern era.  We KNOW that skyscrapers do not neatly fall allowing people 20 feet away to escape unharmed.  We KNOW that flying at a falling Lois Lane at supersonic speeds and plucking her out of the air would break every bone in her body.  And why were there so many scenes of Superman being punched through multiple walls of concrete?  And when half a city block falls into ruin shouldn't the power go out?  And...and....what about the ridiculous Krypton plot line?  Yes, we have the ability to colonize and terra form planets but instead, we will all stay on this one planet and just initiate strict birth control laws.  What...its going to explode?  Aww geez...bummer.  Try your best suspend belief and enjoy the more human moments of an alien trying to be a regular guy and do the right thing.  Think too much about it and, well, you'll begin subtracting stars about 45 minutes in."
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,best parts of this movie were shown in the trailers. Boring and disappointing movie.
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,It was a really good movie
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,"As a comics geek, I was hugely disappointed. If all you want is flashy special effects and fight scenes, you might enjoy this movie. I will admit that the CGI is good and the action is plentiful, but for me that was the only redeeming factor of this movie. If you're looking for intelligent plot or writing, you won't find it."
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Better than the previous three films. But that's not really saying that much. There is some great stuff combined with some not so great stuff.

My wife put it best, calling this film ""Meh of Steel"""
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is the new Superman, I don't care whose childhood got raped. I'd rape your childhood over and over again to have this version of the Man of Steel, Everything about this movie exceeded expectations from the plot to the character development and the strong themes and dark realistic overtone. This is the take on Superman that my generation has been waiting for and it left me in awe right down to the final fight scene."
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,Great Movie loved it
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed the movie. It didn't wow me like I had hoped, but it was enjoyable. I wish the studios would venture into new stories and not the same old retelling. this was a different twist from the original, but not enough to create a sense of newness."
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,A great remake....jumped around a bit too much but way better than Superman returns
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"The action sequence between Superman and general Zod at the end of the movie made a lot of sense. I mean what's Superman going to do, ask Zod to willingly go somewhere else to fight. Zod would've been like fuck you. Since Zod is a better fighter and he wanted to basically kill everyone along with Superman, he kept the fight focused in the city. Also, Superman could not snap Zods neck from the start of their fight because Zod would not allow that opening and Superman just got lucky to get him in a head lock. So much more I need to talk about because I love the movie."
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"very good, but it could have been great

when it tries for character development the film comes alive, but its all too rare."
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,A lot of action but a poor film
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,I loved it because it was so far from the typical Superman story.
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,LOVED SUPERMAN... Henry Cavill shirtless..yummy...  well worth it.
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,I disliked it and I fell asleep so ya.
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,Henry Cavill is Superman!!
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The first half is great and apart from a few missed beats, pitch perfect. The second half descends into unrelateabale violence on a level I can't even process. It wouldn't be so bad if superman had managed to save anyone. He is responsible for as many deaths as the bad guys. So disappointed a real missed opportunity."
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning, and packed with tons of destruction, and an excellent performance Michael Shannon, Man of Steel is a successful entr√©e in the Superman series."
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,A surprising twist on superman that made a great story and awesome movie!
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"You wanted a reboot and here it is!!! This reboot was done astonishingly well, Zach snyder with his well known (The Watchmen) and (300) along w/ Christopher Nolan who we all know to be a legendary director and producer team up to give you the movie that will take your breath away. Man of Steel is my choice for movie of the year! Screw the criticism its been getting and go see it because if not you'll have missed a movie that will renew your faith in superman and how far he can soar!"
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,"hope it goes somewhere better next time, story kinda sucked"
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,good movie and but the look on Superman's face when he starts to fly is to funny
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"Pues a muchos no les gust√≥ tanto la pel√≠cula, lo que yo vi es una muy buena adaptaci√≥n de un Superman m√°s real y sin presunciones directas del comic m√°s humano por decir algo. El principio estuvo muy bueno se siente m√°s real como los papas de Ka-el pierden a su hijo y de ah√≠ anexan la historia de el General Zod. Los odio juzgones"
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie. the affects were awesome, the actors were pretty good, and the story line was cool."
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,bis dato der beste superman film...aber der typ ist halt ein langweiler :)
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This movie did not follow 
 superman theme"
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,Another action-packed take on the superman story. Entertaining but unoriginal.
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,Not impressed at all. It's just ok
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"I'm not a fan of the godlike superheroes--you just never feel any real DANGER with them--but this one takes that invincible theory, and accentuates the real concerns that come with that invincible power.  How would the world work? Would you be able to show restraint with people that try to do harm to you or your loved ones?
  When his presence is finally public, the world reacts pretty much exactly how you think they would--fear, paranoia, throwing all the force of the military at a problem they feel must at least be restrained before being trusted.
  The casting was top-notch, the overall theme was surprisingly intellectual, visuals stunning, and overall kept me entertained in the way I'd expect a summer film to do so."
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,Acting was good.script was alright (everyone knows the story of superman they could of wrapped it up and got back into the action.) I fell asleep threw this movie twice found myself very bored with it. I tried to get into it just wasn't happening. Special effects we pretty good you hardly ever noticed them. Also Henry and Michael were pretty damn believable in there respect roles. All in all make sure your wide awake before trying to take on this movie. (It seems to drag on forever)
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,Liked the characters and the actors.  Story kinda sucked.
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel is the latest attempt to re-boot the oldest super-hero franchise, with grandeur CGI effects, new iconic leading character and loads of pure summer entertainment. Partially a parental drama and with small indirect glimpses of philosophical and religious questions incorporated in the whole mayhem of pure old school action, the new Superman of 2013 is a most welcome come back of the franchise and probably a game-changer in the Hollywood Superheroes world.

Rebooting a franchise which dramatically flopped in the end of the 80s and was already re-started in 2006 with the qualitative, but forgettable and not really entertaining Bryan Singer's version, seemed a crazy idea to many. Yet, director Zach Snyder, together with producer Christopher Nolan, has managed to almost bring the new movie to perfection. For 150 minutes, he has managed to craft and to lay the foundation of a completely new franchise from scratch. Starting with the story of Krypton and Russell Crowe's visionary sending of Kal-El to Earth ensures that the plot is relatively solid and the non-Superman fans get more involved in the story and the world of Superman. This has resulted in making the movie quite watchable and intriguing to those who have never liked this superhero (like me, or have been indifferent to him.

After the relatively long introduction, the focus of the movie shifts to Clark Kent's life, his family relationships and Clark's search for a place in the society. This all is told with unexpected dramatic touch and Zach Snyder has surprised many with his ability to add the parental drama element in this classic ""blow-up-everything"" summer blockbuster. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are simply mesmerizing as Martha and Jonathan Kent and embody all good human weaknesses. Above all, their restrain, love and patience build up a wonderful relationship with Clark Kent. In addition to this, Zach Snyder surprises once again with the slightly religious and theosophical question which he places in the movie. What would be the effect on people, on the societies with monolithic religions, when they understand about Superman, his abilities and his origin? Needless to say, this question is never answered and this theosophical part remains underdeveloped when the real action takes place.

Speaking of the action, it must be said that Man of Steel is a pleasing summer blockbuster. It has everything a big-world-destruction movie should have. The thrills are good, the action sequences perfect and the main villain Michael Shannon as General Zod delivers a memorable and fanatic performances. This time, unlike in Bryan Singer's delivery from 2006, the choice of character for Superman is actually a good one! After a dismal performance in The Cold Light of Day, Henry Cavill has probably found the role which would catapult him to stardom. Solid, appealing and most importantly fitting in his character, Cavill is a pleasure to be watched.

Unfortunately, the blockbuster part is also where the movie has some flaws. Some of the action sequences (the ones in Kansas) evoke logical questions on the effect of the air-fights and destruction on the town and its inhabitants (especially when the scenes are shown from the air). Secondly, Zach Snyder may have remained true to his stunning visual style, but he has not managed to deliver something new, something original when it comes to the battle scenery. Man of Steel is probably the 15th movie in which New York (or Chicago, or Los Angeles) is being destroyed or in which huge battle scenes occur. The feeling of seeing this in Transformers, in The Avengers, Iron Man or you name it, is probably the biggest and most serious issue with the movie.

In conclusion, Man of Steel is definitely a most welcome re-boot of the Superman franchise. With a lot more than pure entertaining to offer, Zach Snyder has indeed set the foundations of a new franchise. A franchise which would hopefully be seen and enjoyed not only by Superman fans, but also by neutral viewers."
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,Too Much dpecial effects.  Very hard to follow unless you know story.
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"I am tired of this storyline and mythology. Lets move on with Superman and tell better tales. Lets ice Lois Lane and Perry White.  Zod was great, and action scenes actually hurt my head."
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great film, lots of action"
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,Was hoping Nolan would have greater influenced this movie. Superman is Superman. He shouldn't be reduced to taking orders from the military. Action scenes were big but the ending was a let down. All the big fight scenes only to reduce the villain to such an easy death.  Disappointed!
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,lived it from beginning to end
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Meh... I thought is was OK. Not the best. Loved the beginning, though! You never really get that back story with SuperMan movies. Russel Crowe was amazing! Super Man was good, but he was better with his shirt off ;)"
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,The Superman movie I was waiting for! Well worth the wait!
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,worst boring movie don't watch it
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"While critics believe this movie to be somewhat cliche, it still delivers as a spectacular superhero movie. Many loved the last installment of the Batman series ""The Dark Knight Rises"" where I found myself enjoying this film more than the previous one. While cliche as a film, I never felt bored or confused with the film, and wasn't able to predict as easily as other superhero movies. The score for the film is phenomenal, and is used perfectly throughout the whole movie, and especially during action scenes. What holds it back is that there are only a few characters which really matter to the storyline, and minor characters are somewhat left out to dry, and mostly used as filler through the whole film. Overall, great for any superhero fan, or any moviegoer really. 4 stars."
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"Best Superman movie made to date. First I've seen that takes the source material seriously rather than some kind of lame humor (yes, I'm dissing ALL of the original Chris Reeve's Superman movies). The ending is somehow controversial but not really, Kal-El has no real  choice in what he does. It is nice to see a Superman who stands for ""Truth, Justice and the American Way"" at a time when it seems like everyone is out to get us."
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"Excelente!! No se si sigue el comic o no, pero me gusto mucho como esta filmada, la trama... todo. SUper llevadera y muy disfrutable. Mostrando tambien el lado ""humano"" y no solamente el tipico hombrecito de hierro indestructible."
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"I'm very happy with the way Man of Steel turned out. I wouldn't think it was good if it was happy, joy, and humorous. I think this darker story of Superman is a lot better. It's more real."
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie yet.
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie was great. If you are a fan of the comic books you may be kind of disappointed but keep an open mind.
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,there was really no plot to this movie the best part was the beginning the last hrs of krypton but after that it goes down hill for what seems like forever with clark traveling from place to place in between flash backs of his past be cause he cant stop helping people. and spoiler alert louise knows who he is cause she figures it out which sure i get that but the illusion of clark doesnt really exist in this movie. and superman doesnt kill...
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,A lot better than Superman Returns.
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,A very disappointing re-boot which  promised lots judging from the strong cast but the story-line was flatter than my chest at 13 years of age. At no point during the film did it really grab hold of my attention as I found numerous opportunities to send text messages. The story lacked a lot of depth from the beginning looking back at the demise of the planet Krypton to how Kal-El evolved from intergalactic orphan to present day Superman. The flashback scenes were very disjointed and lacked the polish and seamless flow-on that JJ Abrams is able to employ in his own films and tv shows. 2 and a half stars.
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,Loved  the new story line -- great movie!
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It's really hard to do superman right. Good attempt, but not as good as it could have been."
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Bombastic, stunning and yet...everything is just a bit off.  The scope of this movie is BIG; certainly befitting the character on which it is based, with the sort of berth that has been missing from most of the films in the Superman Canon (including the unfairly-maligned Superman Returns).  The flashback-style retelling of Kal-El's origin is a smart choice, since he has a back story that most anyone knows by now, so there is no point in slogging through it all, instead highlighting important moments.  But that also causes an unavoidable fragmented structure that messing with the flow of the plot and screws with some of the little nuances the story desperately needs.

Largely missing, however, is the human aspect.  Adams has the chops to pull off Lois Lane, but she gets lost in the shuffle; the brief glimpses of the flirty interplay between her and Cavill are in sorely short supply. Costner portrays Pa Kent with a requisite amount of gravity, but that's all he's given to do; to extoll the vital purpose of Clark's future (pulling double duty on that front is Crowe as the Kyrptoian half of Kal-El's paternal guidence front).  Not all is lost in relationship department, as Cavill and Lane have an easy mother-son report that makes the most of the limited screen-time.

A lot has been made regarding the level of destruction that takes place in the end, and it's somewhat warranted. (Are we sure Roland Emmerich didn't direct this?)  The effects of a group of super-human aliens tussling on Earth is pretty accurate (you know, if this sort of thing could happen anyway) but isn't Superman supposed to protect humanity, not assist in recklessly destroy a major metropolitan area (and downtown Smallville) to subdue the bad guy.  But i can this: that destruction, though excessive, is jaw-dropping-ly impressive and the accompanying action is fast and frantic but easy to follow."
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,One of the best Superman movies
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,So so oh hum another SUPERMAN what's next another Spider-Man
"Jul 6, 2013",NEGATIVE,"So I watched this over two days as on day one I nodded off. If you expect a level of the ridiculous equivalent to Transformers this film won't disappoint.  Endless destruction of Metropolis on a level even Michael Bay would call epic, a very poorly written script, and underwhelming performances all around. I found myself feeling sad for Diane Lane and Russell Crowe."
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"A darker, more destructive Superman who doesn't always rescue everyone and doesn't necessarily practice ""safety first,"" and it works. Easily the best film of the summer."
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,(I almost gave an extra star just for Henry Cavill...)
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"I really like the movie, music and CGI. Its different to watch it in 3D. It would have been better if it has different ending... not too violence..."
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,Long. But it was good.
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,"After 90 minutes of stoic facial expressions and just plain stupid fight scenes, the movie continues more of the pointless same... For nearly another hour!"
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great film. Fantastic performance, cool acting. Love it. You must see you'll love it.!!!"
"Jul 6, 2013",POSITIVE,"I really enjoied it.  I think if your a superman fan you will.  its so much better than Superman Returns, still if your a fan of superman there are parts of them all that you enjoy a little."
"Jul 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Better than The Avengers, yet less revered. Go figure."
"Jul 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,Too long. Too loud. Too stupid. Wait to rent it.
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,It was a very clarifying movie how superman came to be. It was also very exciting and kept you on the edge of your seat.
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie is awesome. Would recommend anybody to see it
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Triumphant return to cinema for Superman, with an awesome cast. DC needed this film to show their about more than just 'Bats' it shares the same grittiness of the nolan trilogy which is what i expected, i thought his origins and flashbacks to his childhood were very well done and its wee things like that which turn a three star into a four star. Excellent film and almost as good as Avengers"
"Jul 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A movie of two parts; One bordering on greatness, the other a stock standard Superman Blockbuster.

The movie starts of venturing through Clark Kent's mortal childhood, where he had to learn to harness his abilities whilst at the same time lead everyone to believe he was just a normal kid. It does a great job of showing the internal struggle notyetSuperman has by not allowing himself the ability to use his powers to their full potential. The second part of the movie is typical Hollywood Blockbuster action of 1 man saving the world from a seemingly all powerful nemesis."
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome retailing of a classic!
"Jul 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,It was a good adaption of the hero but lacked a solid backstory and a lot of parts weren't realistic. I found myself looking in the movie theater wondering how much longer. Amy Adams did a poor job playing Lois Lane in my opinion. By that I mean there was no vibrant chemistry between the two. At first it looks like a good and emotional play on superman but further in it lacks a prominent plot and to me it lacked flow and harmony.
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,wow.!!!!!! what a Movie. seen it in 3D.  Must-Have again.
"Jul 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,Once the story was ditched for an unbearably long fight sequence it went from interesting movie to please be over soon.
"Jul 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,Once the story was ditched for an unbearably long fight sequence it went from interesting movie to please be over soon.
"Jul 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,Visually stunning but strangely soulless and an hour or so over long
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"wow what a movie.......i have just seen this movie 4 the 1st time n think that this is a brilliant movie 2 watch.....its got a good cast of actors/actressess thorughout this movie......i think that henry cavill, amy adams, michael shannon (from the brilliant tv series boardwalk empire), diane lane, russell crowe, antje traue, laurence fishbourne (from the brilliant tv series hannibal), kevin costner, cooper timberline, richard cetrone, play good roles/parts throughout this movie.......i think that the director of this action/adventure/sci-fi/fantasy movie had done a great job of directing this movie because you never know what 2 expect throughout this movie.......i think that this is such a really well directed movie.......i think that the fight scenes were absolutley brilliant throughout this movie......i think that henry cavill was absolutley brilliant as superman........i think that the special effects throughout this movie were absolutley brilliant throughout this movie........i think that the fight scenes throughout this movie were brilliant thorughout this movie........i think that the soundtrack throughout this movie was pretty good as well throughout this movie.......i think that this is a brilliant movie 2 watch......i think that the use of 3-d throughout this movie was really well used.......i think that the fight scenes thorughout this movie were absolutley brilliant, i think that the fight scenes between superman/general zod was absolutley brilliant in this movie.......i think that laurence fishbourne was superb throughout this movie.......i think that kevin costner was good throuhgout this movie as supermans dad.......i think that amy adams was great as the love interest lois lane........i think that michael shannon was superb as general zod.........i think that the fight scenes thorughout this movie were absolutley brilliant.......i think that the fight scenes were absolutey amazing throughout this movie i think that this is a brilliant re-boot of the superman franchise.......i think that this is 1 of the best movies of 2013 its got a great cast throughout this movie i think that this is so really well directed/really well acted its just a brilliant movie 2 watch for 2013 theres some good comedy moments thorughout this movie as well its so really well written its so really well directed its got a great cast thorughout this movie i think that this is a brilliant movie for 2013 with a great cast throughout this movie the soundtrack is pretty good as well its just such a brilliant movie 2 watch its so really well directed its a great movie for 2013"
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,i wish i could see it
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,This film was the most amazing superman film ever shot and it was a great opening to an impressive trilogy. I really hope that they focus more on the character development in the next instalment as another onslaught of action will leave them in dangerous territory...we could even build to an epic climax for superman 3 however another action packed thrill ride will kill this franchise. I promise!
"Jul 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"First of all, I'm not a fanboy of the Superman comics nor will I compare this reboot to the previous movies (or the TV shows and, yes, I can remember even the original.) I thought this movie had an interesting new twist on the Superman origin and, with the added special effects, did a nice job in the re-telling. The fight scenes are epic and really make the Man of Steel seem quite believable. This movie is a definite must see. I gave it 3 1/2 stars but would have given it 4 (or maybe 5), but ... really ... no Lex Luthor? Seriously? Unbelievable ..."
"Jul 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,I realy dot gave a flip about superman but my lil brother gust got home so I had to watch it wit him cuz his my blood. If u wat c go ahead IT my jump around gust a heads up but is ok
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great movie, different than any of the other ones, non stop action. I hope they make a sequel this time."
"Jul 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,"SUPERMAN: MAN OF STEEL. This latest version of the Superman story gives us some pretty decent storytelling and some amazing special effects, but sadly it doesn't offer much more, although it could have, with better writing, better casting. It seems to me the screenwriters were trying to balance between trying to create a profound character out of Clark and putting together a thrilling blockbuster. It starts out developing Clark character as someone who feels alien/different amoung others, a people he is supposed to protect for some reason. But then the film gives up on character and concentrates on action and never really looks back. Christopher Nolan is one of the screenwriters, and if you think about one of his other movies BATMAN BEGINS, it's easy to see how that film concentrates on character (which is why I think it's a better film than THE DARK KNIGHT imo) and follows through as Bruce Wayne/Batman tries to find his way. It may not be a fair comparison, but if you're going to remake Superman, then do it.

The script does not give Henry Cavill (Clark Kent/Superman) much to work with but when he does open his mouth, we discover pretty quickly he's not great at his job. I guess there's a good reason the director and producers try to surround him with supporting talent like Russell Crowe, Michael Shannon, Amy Adams, etc. Luckily for him, Cavill just has to look Superman-ish, like a cardboard cutout, for most of it. The story itself - the destruction of Crypton and the revenge of General Zod - is outlined in an adequate, if uninspired, fashion. It's too bad really, because the story has a lot more to offer. Oh well. In the end it doesn't matter because this blockbuster action film does its job well enough to entertain, barely. If I had a choice between seeing IRONMAN 3, STAR TREK, or SUPERMAN again this Summer, I think I'd stay home and watch BATMAN BEGINS for the sixth or seventh time. The interaction/dialogue between Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman still sets the comic-to-film standard for me. 5.5/10"
"Jul 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Man of Steel is an exciting, action-packed film with some poignant moments, but has too much violence and destruction, mediocre writing, and not enough fun or character development."
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Once again, another great Superman movie"
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"I thought this movie was great. I'm not sure why it has received such criticism. Admittedly, I don't watch every superhero movie out there, but to me it's on par with last year's Avengers and Dark Knight Rises and falls somewhere in the middle in tone.  Henry Cavill is a great actor who did a terrific job - especially since this is a tough role to pull off.  Amy Adams may not have been my first choice for Lois, but she did a fine job.  Russell Crowe is professional as always. All in all, a great movie I'm willing to see again in a theater, which has rarely occurred since I graduated high school a long time ago."
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Not as epic as Batman Begins, but compensates with sheer spectacle.  The tone, dialogue, acting and production are to be given special commendation."
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,This is one of the best movies I've seen in years.  I kept catching myself holding my breath throughout the entire movie!  Henry Cavill is the most compelling Superman since Christopher Reeve!  I REALLY look forward to more movies in this franchise!
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"so much better than superman returns, the beginning was slow only cuz if you have seen all of Christopher Reeves superman films you know about krypton. But action pack will see again."
"Jul 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Terrible.
Walked out an hour into it.
First movie I have ever walked out on."
"Jul 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,This movie was a hot mess.  This was a case where special effects filled in where a storyline should be.
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie ain't great but it was a good movie sssssssssssssssssoooooooooo I give it 9 out of 10.
"Jul 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Typical superhero fare - lots of glossy action and explosions, but it lacks the depth of character and story of a Dark Knight."
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,despite of the reviews.. I liked the movie and really think that Henry Cavill will be the new face of superman for ages to come. Love it
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,I don't know what everyone's problem was work this movie.
"Jul 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,Plot was good. Acting was good. Graphics were obviously computer generated. Disappointed.
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman Movie Yet!! Wonderfully done ~
"Jul 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,I seen the movie just now and there is a lot of action but I think Hollywood has trouble with the truth and justice part of Superman. I hope you get it right next time. :(
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,whoever had doubts about another superman movie well forget them because this was a great movie. it was one of best superhero movies ever. it makes me wonder what people had their heads up when they gave it negative reviews but that is just the shallow society we live in. I cant get over how satisfying it was to see man of steel. I was expecting it to be good but wow what a movie. the action and the writing gave me hope that more movies can someday be like this. inspiring. amazing. just see it in theater for it to do justice.
"Jul 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Too long, too serious, more of a 'Clark Kent' movie, didn't like that he wasn't already a reporter. Plus, some genuine flaws in Supes' character."
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,good movie unpredictable but we'll played
"Jul 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Good summer blockbuster, but for me, Terrence Stamp will always be General Zod."
"Jul 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"not bad, a little drawn out but decent action scenes"
"Jul 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"With all they hype this got it was a pretty big letdown.  However, there were moments that were quite enjoyable.  For instance, I thoroughly enjoyed the parts that showed him growing up.  The scene on the bus was one of my favorites.  There also, was occasional bits of humor, like the diner scene.   However, for the most part Man of Steel had just too much action and no break for the viewer.  Just like in music how silence helps to create beauty in sound, this movie had no silence in the action.  For example the movie started like this: Superman's planet explodes, Superman saves people from a burning boat, Superman has traumatic experience as a kid and so on.  There needed to be some comfort in the movie and there was none.  Finally the last fight scene lasted way too long.  It's clear that this movie was made by the director of 300.  How fitting that it should go so hard.  Sure it was fun for awhile.  But man I needed a break."
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Fresh new superman, why so serious?"
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,I've always hated Superman but now I'm in love because of this movie!
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie wass epic thats all i could say
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie is one of the best superman incarnations.
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Good story from beginning to end. Great action..
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie by far and the best film I've seen this year.
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,good good good. this aint your grand pappies superman story. lots of destruction and best superman tale yet!
"Jul 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,Overlong...too much CGI fighting sequences that quickly become dull and repetitive. But some interesting and fresh ideas for the myth.
"Jul 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I dont understand why the film is getting such bad ratings. all i am saying M.O.S is not Nolan's Realistic trilogy. Its a Sci-Fi  like marvel's avengers. Some People argue that it M.O.S is similar to Avengers. To them i'll say Avengers was a copy of Transformers: Dark of The Moon. If we look into cartoons, movies, and comics its all about saving the world. story is going to be same only difference would be what tools are used to support the story. 
Secondly, superman is all about SUPER-Human. So it has to be a detailed and long. Snyder took  Superman to a next level. He explored an alien in his three identities, as Kal-El, Clark Kent and Superman. Out of all superman-movies, Man of Steel explored the chracter into depth. Like Batman-Begins, M.O.S went deeper than just being a Superhero, it explored the other dimensions of the character. Starting with confused & demotivated  Clark Kent to Kal-El an alien, a good learner and focused and finally Superman, Steel not only from outside, but inside. As for  Henry Cavill Proved he can be  modern-day superman. Compared to Brandon Routh, who kept the same level of the character as Christopher Reeves did, Henry Cavill took it deeper than the surface. There was not one moment when audience felt like that he is not Superman. Cavill did the best he could as superman.  
As an action movie, i think for me after Matrix trilogy and Tom Cruise movies superman was the best action. ""Fast"" ""breathtaking jaw Dropping""  ACTION SEQUENCES.
Russel Crowe, Micheal Shanon, Amy Adams, Daine Lane did the best jobs. I dont think any other actor could have done a better job. Micheal Shanon as General Zod, well no comments on that other than BEST!
Overall the movie was one of the best superhero movies i have ever seen. It redefined the meaning of Summer's Epic movie after TDK trilogy."
"Jul 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Its Science fiction, Grand, Mythical, Very Entertaining  and its SUPER-man after all . Like it. Should not  be missed in 3D or Bigger in IMAX"
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel was a great addition to the Superman lore, updated nicely and totally removed itself from the disappointing ""Superman Returns"" by giving ""super bad guys"" for the Man of Steel to fight, which was the weakest point of the aforementioned movie.  My nly complaint was that after choosing to see it in 2D IMAX, the volume of the theater was so loud as to be almost painful, don't get me wrong, I love BIG, LOUD summer blockbusters, but my three girls who are 7, 5, and 3, were literallycringing at the noise level, even though afterwords they all said the movie was awesome(but loud).  A great summer flick! What I go to the movies for."
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Everything in this film all collaborate to create an audio visual explosion that will keep you captivated throughout and keep you routing for the Man of Steel from start to finish. Take it from me, if you like the man in the red cape you wont be complaining. Also watch out for the Lexcorp and Wayne Enterprise logos - very clever DC very clever."
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Nice spin on the origin story. Intense action scenes.
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Super Man is back! And it was a good movie. They could destroyed Metropolis in less time and got the point across. Super Man is a hero. and yes, spoiler alert... he kills the bad guy! Sometimes, bad people die...but hey the hot bad arse chick didn't...maybe she can come back!"
"Jul 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It's a mess, but a respectful one."
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"I was wondering why it has such bad reviews and I walked out of the movie theatre still thinking why. Not perfect but the Superman story has baggage that it has to bring with it and would have liked to see the linear version of the movie, I feel like I would have cared more if his life wasn't just flash backs."
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Ignore the stuck-up critics.  This movie was a fun visual spectacle.  A real popcorn movie.
"Jul 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,"'Man of Steel' has a concept problem. It tries make with Superman in same way how Christopher Nolan's Batman movies. But Superman and Batman are different heroes and things can't work in similar way for both. The movie treats Superman as an alien all the time and it's an different approach, but it's awful for the plot: it can be a paradox, but the character needs be viewed as one of us to convince. There some good moments, all of them in flashback scenes. But the final part is particularly weak: it's only interested in destruction."
"Jul 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,I saw this movie for free and I still want my money back. Do not see even on DVD. You will wish for your time back.
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Thought it was good, lots of action and Superman is FINE!!"
"Jul 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"""Welcome to the Planet."" 

This is the most recent movie I watched. I watch a lot of films. I know a lot of directors. Now, like everyone else, I have my own opinion about everything. I have favorite directors (C. Nolan, Q. Tarantino), writers (P. Schrader, J. Nolan), and of course, movies. I don't wanna seem smug. I'm not a shallow man. My opinion isn't the only opinion I want to hear. I also wanna hear other people's opinion. I've seen countless lists of favorite films, writers, etc. For all Favorite Directors lists I've read, I have watched at least one film by every director. Even the really old ones like Hitchcock and Welles. But of all those directors, there was one of them whose films I haven't seen yet. It was Zack Snyder. I was born before the mid-2000's, so I've heard of Mr. Snyder. Despite the fact he's made some actually really good and underrated movies (I'm just speaking the general opinion), his reputation has seemingly been ripped apart all because of one film. You guessed it, Sucker Punch. Yeah yeah, he had that one owl film (that's what everyone seems to be calling it now) that nobody really liked, but Sucker Punch, one could say, ""defined"" his career. Which is weird, because this is the guy who made Watchmen and the Dawn of the Dead remake. I haven't watched either of those, but I heard both of them were really good. I heard Watchmen would be on a Most Underrated Films list if there ever was one. He even made 300, which I heard was great fun. Three good films and one mediocre one isn't much of an AFI Achievement-worthy career, but it shouldn't have been taken down just because of one awful film. I didn't even hear Sucker Punch was that bad. I heard it was a little worse than That One Owl Film. Just a little. But nonetheless, I am not much of a strong-minded guy, and I am very easily swayed by the opinions of the critics who are much older and wiser than myself. That doesn't mean I'm a tool. I don't always meet eye-to-eye with them, but with the impression they've made for Zack Snyder as a mediocre filmmaker, I was not looking forward to Man of Steel as much as most people. It seemed like that film that most people are supposed to be looking forward to because someone who has a really good filmmaking career is attached to it. Like Avatar and The Departed. The former had James Cameron, and latter had Martin Scorsese. In Man of Steel's situation, the film had Christopher Nolan. The fact that Christopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer were involved at all with this film, and the fact that Snyder has actually made some (presumably) pretty good movies, were facts that made me want to remotely see this film. But even with Batman and Dr. Manhattan attached to this project, I still didn't feel like this film captured my attention like other films being shown in 2013 did. Kick-Ass 2 looks interesting. The Wolverine looks awesome. I would illegally download The World's End if I could. For this film, I felt as if I'd only go to see Man of Steel if I was offered free tickets on cereal box or something. I only started avoiding this film like the plague when the reviews came up. I saw lots of people expecting a 94% or 88% for this movie. When I saw its rating during the first couple of weeks, of all the parts inside of my brain, only three or four of those parts were surprised at this film's unsatisfactory rating of 72%. Don't get me wrong, because I don't consider films at the 70's range to be bad. I liked Wanted. It's just that really high ratings like 90% are warranted for this film, at least for other people. For me, this could've been at least 80%, but like I said, I wouldn't have been that surprised if this film didn't end up as the truly masterful adaption of Superman. But then it slowly descended into the 60's. Then I went to see it, just so I can see if it's good or not. I wasn't looking forward to it at all. Before that, I would've at least been a little excited for the film, but by then, I wasn't. I could've watched something else, but the only other film to see was After Earth. I didn't really think Nolan producing would make the film any better. Producers, in my opinion, aren't terribly important to me. Writers and actors are important, but the most important people are the directors. The directors are the first people I search for when a new movie is announced. The Summer Movie Streak has not failed me yet. I had low expectations. There was no way this movie could've been good. Right? 

Wrong. Now I haven't watched any of the other Superman films. There was the original, universally acclaimed one, the similarly well-received sequel, a well-received yet extremely backlashed reboot, and two other films that no one liked. The only other Superman I can compare Zack Snyder's rendition is the Justice League animated series one. So I'm not gonna compare. I'm gonna review this film with a fresh and new perspective. This movie was really good. The performances were fantastic, and very natural. Roger Ebert said in his review of Superman Returns that Brandon Routh didn't really capture the essence of Superman and he was probably cast in the film only because he looks like Christopher Reeve. I didn't feel that with Henry Cavill. He was realistic in that role. One does not simply play the role of Superman unless the actor who's being considered has that heroic, curious, good-natured, and caring persona. Mr. Cavill seems to be a very versatile actor because he seems to be capable to have that happy Superman persona and push it to his highest capacity, but he can also turn serious and brooding on a dime. I also commend Diane Lane, Kevin Costner, Michael Shannon, and Russell Crowe. Jeremy Jahns, in his positive review of Man of Steel, said even if Shannon was good as General Zod, he anyone could've played him and it wouldn't have been that different. I disagree. Shannon turned ""Kneel before Zod!"" into ""I will find him!"", and he did it in an excellent and over-the-top manner. He looked very menacing, and one can see that he was determined and persevering in his goal to bring back Krypton. There was a giant lack of character development in the film besides Kal-El, and lack of character development usually doesn't make me care about character. Let's say I was watching a zombie film, and there were lots of characters in it. Too much characters = not much character development, right? Because of the lack of character development on the main character, if he/she died, I wouldn't care. Why would I? I don't know much about that character 'cause he had no character development. And usually, you don't really care if a guy or girl you don't know dies. That's what I would've felt with Jonathan and Martha Kent because I didn't see any character development on them. But they were played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, movie stars who's performances are unquestionable. You can go wrong with the movies they star in, but you can't go wrong with their performances. I didn't really care for them when they appeared during Kal-El's kid and teenager flashback sequences, but my appreciation for them really peaked during the middle and towards the end of the film. Besides crazy action films and dark and gritty films, I also like those films that are emotional. I'm not much of a romantic drama guy, but I like scenes that make me tear up. Scenes like that usually have a character dying. Though besides those scenes, the scenes where I tear up are scenes that are really intense or really beautiful and dramatic. I haven't fully watched American Psycho, but I watched the scene when Patrick Bateman leaves a lengthy telephone message for his lawyer. It made me tear up because it was intense and dramatic. And in Man of Steel, you have Kevin Costner dying in a tornado. That's right, Jonathan Kent dies. That may not seem surprising to anyone who watched the original movie, but it was hell of a lot surprising to me. When I saw Jonathan's grave, I could not help myself to think why, of all people in the film to kill, they chose Kevin Costner! I haven't seen much Costner films, and my favorite is probably JFK, but he was undeniably spectacular in that film. List of actors you cannot kill under any circumstances (At least in my book) Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Bruce Willis, Robin Williams, and most comedic actors (Jason Bateman, Ben Stiller, etc.) Kevin Costner was obviously on that list. It wasn't Henry Cavill who convinced me to watch the film, mostly because he was in another film the year before which I heard was an unforgivably formulaic and generic action film schlock. Of course, it was The Cold Light of Day, starring Bruce Willis, Sigourney Weaver, and the man of the hour, Henry Cavill. Jeremy Jahns named the Cold Light of Day #2 on his Top Worst Movies of 2012. It was able to muster a 5% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In his extremely negative review, Mr. Jahns explained if it weren't for Willis and Cavill's names attached to the main cast, the Cold Light of Day might as well have been a straight-to-DVD film.  But I decided to give him a shot even if ""wooden"" seemed like his defining characteristic. Now that I think about it. when I see some clips of the original Superman with Christopher Reeve, it really does remind me of Henry Cavill. But that's beside the point. He may still have looked like Christopher Reeve just like Brandon Routh did, yet he was still, at best, an awesome Superman, and at least, a not too shabby one. Not too shabby, at all. 

When it came to negative opinions about this film, there were very few of them. I saw some negative reviews and they were really negative, some from critics, some from audience. ""Henry Cavill is emotionless and wooden."", ""Too much action and too less thought makes this one a dud."", ""Zack Snyder has destroyed Superman."" That last part I strongly disagree with. I really, really don't have any say when it comes to Snyder's direction because I haven't watched any other movie of his, but his direction was actually pretty good in Man of Steel. It's honestly not Snyder. It sure as hell isn't Nolan or Zimmer, so who was it? Holy Bad Dialogue, Batman, it was Goyer! That is right. David S. Goyer, more specifically his writing, was one of the weakest points of the film. As you all know, David S. Goyer was a writer that worked with Christopher Nolan when he directed 2008's The Dark Knight. You might think he was a good choice for Man of Steel just because he wrote The Dark Knight, but there is one thing you didn't notice. Back in 2006-2007, when The Dark Knight was being written and stuff, David S. had a whole ton of help from Jonathan Nolan, Chris Nolan's brother. You know, Jonathan Nolan, he wrote Memento Mori, the short story which C. Nolan's Memento was based on. He also has an acclaimed new show that I really should be checking out right now, and more importantly, he was a writer who also wrote The Dark Knight. He helped Goyer with the script, which is the only reason the dialogue didn't suck. On Man of Steel, Goyer didn't have J. Nolan to help him remove all the laughable cheesiness and absolutely pathetic parts of the script. Towards the end of the film, Superman drops a giant military thing (it might a satellite or something, but the point is he drops it) and it crash-lands on Earth. That grumpy military guy and that small military girl arrive at the crash site right before it happens. I'm not saying the military guy looked so tough and menacing that he could've been mistaken for R. Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket, but he looked like a legit military man. That was until he said to Superman what David Goyer thought was a cool thing to say, ""Are you effin' stupid?"". Then, after Superman leaves, Platoon asks the rookie girl, ""What are you smiling at?"" or something like that (acting as if his former statement never happened and was still supposed to be a badass captain) to which she replies, addressing the Man of Steel, ""Nothing. I just think he's pretty hot."" David S. Goyer is not a good writer. To everyone who loved this movie to death and is now raping the thumbs-down button, repeatedly and angrily asking for an alternative to the so-called ""bad"" dialogue, I'll tell you people this: I don't need offensive or un-Superman-like material such as curses in a PG-13 Superman movie. I just want the film to stop trying to act like Sin City or Watchmen, films that were praised not only for its visuals and storyline, but also because it wasn't afraid to include a few possibly offensive material to stay true to the comic. When making a Superman film, the only thing that shouldn't be on the writer or director's mind is, ""Should I include dialogue pieces such as ""frickin'"" or ""dick"" in the movie? Maybe I should because it would stay true to the comic."" Do the Superman comics have stuff like that? No, they don't. Maybe I would've respected the film more if they just went all out with the curses and violence and stuff. If they were gonna include those pansy words I just mentioned, they might have well just went all out and screw all those who would take a dump on the film because of all the curses and violence. It might lose the Superman touch, but it would feature the most entertaining directing traits of both Snyder and Nolan, and it would've mustered at least a 63%-67%. Let's face it if someone says ""freaking"" or ""freakin'"" in real life, it sounds lame and stupid, it honestly, does. If someone says that to me, instead of being offended, I just wish he would just say what he really feels and say, ""You're an inanimate fucking object!"" instead of censoring his words like SOPA. Conversely, I would've also respected this film more if it were like 1978's Superman: The Movie. I saw an article a long time ago saying that Richard Donner's Superman movie adaptation was a kind of movie no one makes anymore. Superman: The Movie was said to be great fun, and it was full of heart and hilarity. Though it was fun, it wasn't Grindhouse or Django Unchained fun, where the scenes you're supposed to laugh at are scenes where a mobile serial killer is beaten by several women and when a woman is unexpectedly but physically impossibly shot by a black bounty hunter. I don't have anything against Rodriguez and Tarantino whose humor consists of those type of things, but sometimes I like to laugh at good, clean humor. The article stated, mostly referencing the then upcoming Man of Steel, that all comic book movies have to be dark. The kind of humor 2011's The Muppets and Winnie the Pooh presented, and the kind of humor Donner's Superman probably presented, just to name a few, was popular back then, but modern directors nowadays think that good and clean is boring and lame. Superman: The Movie is what Man of Steel could have been. But they still had to include those scenes where younger Clark was getting bullied by fat Ronald Weasley on that bus and when grown up Clark was getting bullied by Joel from The Last of Us in that bar, among others. Those scenes seemed to have a touch of Nolan in it. Don't think Nolan is incapable of having curses in his films because he directed Memento. They were very out of place. So in short, a film can either be full-on dark, or full-on light. I think the reason Man of Steel pathetically tried to stay in the middle was because it wanted to have a realistic tone but didn't want the inevitable comparison between it and Nolan's TDK trilogy to happen too much. It was a really stupid thing to do, and if you ask me, I would've preferred trying to be like 1978's Superman, because that, that is what Superman is. Let's get to the character development. Probably the least developed thing in Man of Steel was the relationship between Kal-El and Lois Lane. This strange guy with an overly muscular body saves you during an extremely retarded escapade, who then dooms your world when that guy from Sorority Letter sends a world-wide ransom call asking for that strange guy who saved your life to turn himself in, then you talk to him a bit, then you guys are on a spaceship and there is a whole 40-50 minutes of an over-abundance of action, he saves your life again, but destroys your city in the process. Then what? You kiss him? It's not believable, it's not cute, and it surely isn't right. Also, with the character Lois herself. This is a Superman film, and it should be about Superman, but at least have some insight on Lois Lane like Returns did (that's right, I am commending Superman Returns for something right it did). I admit it, if Lois bled out on the icy floor during the start of the movie in that Krypton storage thing, or if she had been like Hans Gruber and fell hundreds of miles and became part of the ground towards the end of the movie, I would not have cared at all. I also have some other problems like Lawrence Fishbourne's character being too bland and pedestrian (I expected him to be like J.K Simmons in Spider-Man) or Zod's female sidekick also being kind of uninteresting, they're not really center characters so I'll let it slide. 

The reason I'll be putting my biggest problem with Man of Steel on the last paragraph is because it has nothing to do with the set pieces within the film. It has something to do with the word ""fanboy"". I believe it is like YOLO or SWAG. It is a retarded word that is used by people because it's cool to do it. I'm upset at the racket this film has made. I'm upset at the fans of this film, and I'm upset at the people who hated it. I hate the fact that Nolan's films, though most people actually think they are good, people nowadays treat them as if they were Terrence Malick films. Pretentious films  masking themselves as intelligent. The worse part is that I know for a fact some people hate on him because it is the cool thing to do. I know some people actually genuinely dislike Nolan, but other guys hate him because it's what all the cool kids are doing. Another percent of these haters are the overly sensitive ones. Let's say you are on the topic of Nolan's filmmaking quality and the moment you defend Insomnia for featuring the World's Greatest Dad as a psychopath or defending Inception for stealing too much content from Paprika and that Scrooge McDuck/Donald Duck comic strip, one of the users you're conversing with immediately posts something like, ""Looks like we got a butthurt fanboy on our case!"" It's really, really stupid. Let's get to why I'm upset at the fans too. I'm not gonna call them fanboys because I try to be good empathizer. Remember when The Dark Knight Rises was released to pretty good reviews, even universally acclaimed? That was also when die hard fans of Nolan started posting empty death threats and vows to shut down the websites of every critic who gave TDKR a bad or somewhat negative review. A whole part of the Rotten Tomatoes website was shut down because of the controversy, and I think there was a brief comeback of the RT Lynch Mob. You may remember them for their attack on Armond White for ruining District 9's 100% rating with his review (which thought it was more important than it actually was, like all his other reviews). Like the haters, there is a large percent of these fans that are overly sensitive. I myself am a big fan of Nolan. My top two favorite films are films directed by him, so it's very obvious. But not only do these ""fans"" treat Christopher Nolan like a god, they also create a very bad reputation for Nolan's fanbase, as their uncivilized behavior towards who don't like or are otherwise indifferent towards their god gives a clear representation of what kind of people Nolan films attract. Because of this, being a Nolan fan isn't normal. Except when you're talking to a fellow Nolan fan, anyone else would ask, ""You're a Nolan fan? Really?"" They still question you, which is something they wouldn't do if you said you were a fan of anyone else, like Quentin Tarantino. These ""fans"" are destroying Christopher Nolan more than the haters ever did. That being said, I am still proud to be a fan of Nolan. Now back to Man of Steel, it wasn't a bad film. But it was still undeniably cheesy and over-the-top. If this was a Nolan film, I would say that in a nicer way since I've never insulted a Nolan movie like that before. But it's not a Nolan film; he may have produced it, but no. It's a Snyder film, and therefore I can say whatever damn please to. So I will say that Man of Steel is an entertaining popcorn film, a film that is absolutely perfect for the summer. It doesn't really line up with anything else Christopher Nolan has been involved with, mainly because it doesn't nearly capture the innovative style of his normal films. What's worse is that Man of Steel fails to rise above the mostly inevitable flaws of a comic book film, especially with its unfunny and extremely cheesy dialogue, bland side characters, distracting presentation of action and mayhem, and the overblown CGI. Most of all, it mostly fails to be what I expected it to be: a mediocre comic book-ish disaster. And that is why it mostly succeeds."
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Thought the movie was very good -- the new superman is takes on the role well and the story line is more interesting then past modern Superman movies
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Not sure why people didn't like this movie but it was a great movie!! I grew up with the old ones and this one was by far better. What do people want in a movie today? These critics are absolutely killing me!! When a movie gets bad ratings from critics, it makes me want to see it even more."
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome movie best Superman movie by far. .. well done. ..
"Jul 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Despite people hating it, i always kind of liked ""Superman Returns"". Now that we have ""Man of Steel"" it makes ""Superman Returns"" looking even better! Thanks Mr. Snyder for that poorly written, stupid, unnecessary brutal and violent thing of a movie..."
"Jul 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Nolan certainly gives a unique take on Superman.  For most fans, you'll either love it or hate it.  Its fair to say that much of the everyday, Clark Kent personality is subdued in this interpretation.  In lieu, we are given plenty of spectacular action sequences, especially a run of the mill, save-the-earth-blockbuster sequence through the back half.

The analogy to the Batman Trilogy is apt here, and I think Nolan has gained enough respect to say this is a decent entry to the trilogy, similar to Batman Begins, and we eagerly await his Dark Knight-like sequel.  :)"
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great Characters, Great Story and an amazing performance by Michael Shannon. This was everything a superman fan could wish for and more. My only one complaint was the way it jumped back and forth from the present to the past. Apart from that this is in opinion the best superhero movie of the year so far."
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,This version of Superman is very good. Starts at the beginning and (of course) leaves room for the next installment at the end. Henry Cavill is well cast as the man of steel. Very enjoyable movie.
"Jul 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Pretty bad- not as bad as the last. Fun in bits, lazy in others and down right irritating in others I was pretty disappointed."
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Outstanding movie. Fantastic special effects.  Will not disappoint
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Excellent. A spectacular superhero romp in a deliciously detailed world. Finally a DC Comics movie that stands tall, and the Superman I've been looking for for years."
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"fantastic. Great action, great effects"
"Jul 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Was a little disappointed. I'm a huge Superman fan and wish the movie kinda stuck to original storyline. Although the new Superman is definitely as handsome as his predecessors, he lacks the innocence, boyish charm, and morale. This Superman is a darker unbelievable version of the old superhero we grew up with. He does things that the old Clark Kent/Superman never would. A lot of death, extensive action and darkness in this film. On top of that I didn't think Amy Adams was a good fit for the Lois Lane role."
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"the man of steel is a big hit!!! I think everyone will like it.
I read all the comics their good a action film sincerely, Frederick ray ortiz"
"Jul 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Stars Include One for Music 
One for Cinematography and VFX 
One for Story by David S Goyer
The Movie has many of Negative aspects as Superman fights Zod in between City rather than taking him to some Safer Place where Massive Destruction doesnt happen 
Also in between the film slows down to a too much that sometimes it seems boring.
The Film takes to the Destruction level as shown in Michael Bay's 2012 which was not required for a Superhero movie."
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Zack Syder's Man of Steel is one of the most worthy franchise reboots of recent years. There's a lot to explore from what's established/defined, and gives a fresh, darker and slightly realistic vision of the Superman universe. The film's plot mainly has two focus points: Clark/Karl El's identity, origin and purpose along with General Zod's arrogant ambitions to ensure the Kryptonite's survival. Special effects are for one Outstanding, very well suited to Zack Snyder's style, the cast are exceptional, the action; exhilarating, OTT at times but worth every cent, big, bold and epic."
"Jul 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Some will say the film dragged on endlessly with no peaceful end in sight. Others will question casting decisions. And yet others ask if any of the emotion int he film is authentic or geniune. All of the above have been cited as misteps, but in many cases those people are simply nitpicking through Man of Steel to satisfy the undying urge to hate any Superman movie to reach the silver screen.

Can you blame those people? Certainly not! It's a learned behavior similar to that of Pavlov's Dog. Every time the ""dog"" sees a new Superman film, he must recoil in pure and unadulterated disgust.

The length wasn't all that bothersome, truth be told. The pacing was inadequate at best, which may have led to some of these feelings, but that is easily enough overlooked.

The explosion were over the top and most notably unnecessary in many spots. At some point during the viewing of the film, you will undoubtedly ask yourself if Michael Bay staged a secret coup for control of the project. It must have been a rather unpleasant experience for Henry Cavill -- as he was seemingly covered in jet fuel the entire movie.

Amy Adams was also, indeed a misfire that can be attributed to the casting department. Some would question the authenticity of the romance between Adams' Lane and Superman, but in regards to that issue, I would be more inclined to blame the overall lack of depth or plot development. A problem here and with the entire film is that there was just no development outside of the first few scenes on Krypton. Like their romance, everything JUST HAPPENS. In the beginning, there was nothing. And then God said... "":Let there be light!"". Zack Snyder merely snapped his fingers, stood atop his directors chair and shouted, ""let there be ROMANCE!"".

Man of Steel builds up to absolutely nothing -- or quite potentially a whole of something that just so happens to be nothing. The film doesn''t care to explain or grow relationships very much -- or the story at all, really. Quite disappointing.

It would also take someone of an extremely dense thought process not to notice the plethora of flashbacks used throughout the run time of the movie. These flashbacks worked to a certain point, but there was just so many of them. They kept flying at you from various directions at various speeds carrying various messages, intuition, or back story. Zack Snyder really disrupted the flow and pacing of the film with his heavy reliance on the flashback.

Continuously taking breaks in the action to go force some developmental tidbit into a flashback because they were too lazy to do it in the course of the actual movie is most definitely an action to scoff at.

As for other casting decision, I genuinely enjoyed Cavill. However, after saying that, this next bit is going to make the aforementioned seem contrived. 

Any single scene featuring Lois, Clark, or Lois and Clark were heavily out-shined by moments that included neither character.

Russell Crowe and any scenes containing Crowe were beyond worthy of your attention. After the credits roll, I was most certainly wishing the film would have been wholly origin. The entire movie could have been about the development of Krypton, the rise of power of Zod and Jor, and then the successful attempt to get Kal-El far far away from Krypton. The final scene of that film dreamed up of wishful thinking could have featured the opening scenes to the current film. The end result would have been a much more polished and doubly effective film.

Laurence Fishburne, Diane Lane, and Kevin Costner all fit there smaller secondary roles with exceptional candor. Michael Shannon was also a particularly interesting villain whose character deserved better on the writing end of things.

And, even though I liked Cavil. I very much enjoyed the casting of teenage Clark, Dylan Sprayberry. He showed a great deal of poise and his performance was an overall plus for the film as a whole.

Visually the film is stunning. The action sequences are glorious.  The comic relief, which should be a staple in any hero film were poorly timed but well meaning. 

But in the end the lack of development really hurts the end product. Did those in charge actually want us to care about any of these characters? If so, they surely found a success-proof way of establishing those connections. The most emotionally gripping moment came at the the fingertips of Laurence Fishburne.

While Man of Steel fared better than the Superman films that came before it -- there was still much to be desired."
"Jul 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Well directed and acted and kept interested, but a bit schmaltzy, fights where you know nobody will die, and Lois Lane wasn't hot!***1/2"
"Jul 4, 2013",POSITIVE,The  Ultimate Superman Movie. A must see film for the funs of super hero movies........
"Jul 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Lack of character development, story, and scene continuity. Huge letdown."
"Jul 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"it was a long movie, but i felt it was not enough."
"Jul 3, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome movie!  Love the different twist!
"Jul 3, 2013",POSITIVE,Good movie all superman lovers will love this.
"Jul 3, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The dull, muted scenes consisting of greys, blacks, whites, and washed-out reds only add to the depressing tone of a movie whose first half consists of an overly serious and plot hole filled look at a depressed character who can't find his place in the world, and whose last half is pure, sensory-overloading action and destruction that had me zoning out and longing for the light humor of The Avengers and had my movie buddy stating afterwards that she felt like she had been in a car crash. Man of Steel's only redeeming quality is Russell Crowe's truly entertaining performance but unfortunately, an entire movie cannot be carried solely by a supporting character. If you are wanting to see a good superhero movie, take my advice: wait for this one on DVD or TV, and put your theater cash toward seeing a Marvel masterpiece."

If you are wanting to see a good superhero movie, take my advice, wait for this one on DVD or TV, and put your theater cash toward seeing a Marvel masterpiece."
"Jul 3, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superhero movie of the summer! On par with the Batman movies!
"Jul 3, 2013",NEGATIVE,Ugh. I miss Christopher Reeve.
"Jul 3, 2013",POSITIVE,I really really enjoyed this.
"Jul 3, 2013",NEGATIVE,Although this movie had a few bright moments and showed me that Superman has potential to be told on the big screen. The entire movie was put together in a weird way and the action scenes just were WAY TOO MUCH
"Jul 3, 2013",NEGATIVE,Mediocre had some good points but. It'll like the hulk.  Not great but better then superman returns ...pile of poo that was
"Jul 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,Much better incarnation than the last one but still not a great one. Hanry Cavill delivers
"Jul 3, 2013",NEGATIVE,:P booring! Save your money
"Jul 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"As a long time superman skeptic, I thought man of steel did a good job of humanizing what is otherwise an inhuman character.  Most critics need to stop focusing on what was and start focusing on what is."
"Jul 3, 2013",NEGATIVE,"What a mess. A complete absence of storytelling, the blandest characters, the most static and pathetic camerawork, editing to make even the most pathetic B movie look awesome, and an absence of even COMIC BOOK logic where Supes destroys a whole city, VISIBLY OBVIOUSLY killing tens of thousands, and we're supposed to believe he gives a shit about one death? Or killing or saving lives or whatever of the sort when clearly, he doesn't have any clue of the havoc he's causing? I swear if it was me I'd have this guy thrown out of the Milky Way. The few things that were positive were the starting Krypton scenes, the sidestory with the Guardian (AWESOME!) and the flashbacks with Kevin Costner. The rest was an epic mess than I have already forgotten which is SAD because I wanted to love this movie and went in as giddy as a schoolgirl to watch it. Sorely Disappointed."
"Jul 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Minus the occasional bad scripting - it was, by far, one of the best (if not thee best) Superman film. Wasn't expecting much going into it - cause I couldn't take another Superman disappointment (not to mention already not being the biggest Superman fan) - but I came out pleasantly surprised and fulfilled."
"Jul 3, 2013",NEGATIVE,This movie is one of the most overrated and one of the most disappointing movies this summer. The dull dialogue and action scenes really are what make this movie mediocore
"Jul 3, 2013",POSITIVE,Seen it twice already. Cant wait till the 3rd times a charm.
"Jul 3, 2013",POSITIVE,Good summer movie. Good super hero movie.
"Jul 3, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Just felt kinda lame, but Superman movies in general have never been that good."
"Jul 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,30 minutes too long.
"Jul 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"He's an alien.  It's a movie about THE most iconic comic book character in HISTORY.  If you take it too seriously, you won't enjoy it."
"Jul 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,The best Superman movie I've ever watched... so far.
"Jul 3, 2013",NEGATIVE,"typical project involving Chris Nolan, it starts out pretty cool then it's like he gets distracted & the movie becomes AWEFUL. Why are so many movies becoming these extremely fast paced extreme high action CRAP......seriously does every movie have to be appealing to teenagers with an attention span of a fly? there are plenty of movie goers that love good plots with a story"
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"a me √® piaciuto tanto..il legame padre-figlio, l'infanzia rivissuta nei flashback, la ricerca di se stesso da parte del protagonista, la storia d'amore tra superman e lois, tutti gli attori, gli effetti speciali..forse la battaglia finale √® un p√≤ lunga eincasinata ma vabeh..henry cavill (che io ricordavo nei panni di alberto mondego in 'montecristo') √® venuto su proprio bene..MAQUANT'√®BBELLOOOOOOO!!!.. <3 <3 :D"
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"Every negative review basically equates to ""WHY ISN'T THIS A ROMANTIC COMEDY."" I got exactly the movie I wanted to see from this. Maybe people are just mad that this Superman doesn't have a fruit roll up insignia to throw at Zod..."
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,hmm... it was ok.. too much motion going on with the camera... still prefer watching the classic superman!
"Jul 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Man of Steel, Bag of Shite"
"Jul 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,i thought it was terible because  there was  no action in it maybe like 5 mins of it but they just keep doing the same thing
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,I wanted to give this movie 4 stars but there wasn't enough action! Great movie overall though with the flashbacks and his character in the film.
"Jul 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,Pretty boring movie. It call my attention the first 30 minutes then I almost fell sleep and I absolutely hate the last 30minutes when superman and the bad guy were kicking each other again and again...and Lois appeared everywhere!!
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this take on the story of my favorite superhero. The acting was stellar, the fight scenes were great and I like the way it was shot - although editing seemed a bit choppy."
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie. Don't know what's up with the critics.
"Jul 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,Nothing really stood out. The lady soldier were actually more entertaining to watch fighting than Superman.  It was definitely better than past few Superman attempts since Reeves.
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,they needed a hotter co star with superman
"Jul 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Too long, too stupid, too much action, too less story..."
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,I thought it was fun. Superman is pleasant to look at and I like Amy Adams in just about everything she does.
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,Superman has a great bod!
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Man of Steel suffers from a messy plot, way too much destruction and mayhem and forgets about the story it tries hard to tell.  Superman as a conflicted, misunderstood alien figure is a smart take on the character but Batman he is not.  The movie lacks the warmth and humour of the previous films.  I liked the idea of probing into the darker side of Superman's character but the director Snyder chooses to rely too much on the special effects spectacle."
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,not the best superman film
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of steel is very good, see it whatever chance you get. I distinctly remember being in that theater, seeing the WB logo and such. Great theater experience"
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,Lots of action and a realistic storyline.  Almost too much at times.
"Jul 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,typical action film that happens to have superman in it.
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"Ignore the critics. There are plenty of flaws to nitpick about, but Man of Steel does everything it needs to as a Superman reboot, the flagship of the nascent DC cinematic universe, and a standalone hero flick."
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It was nice,but failed to connect. Lots of action,but for some reason I wanted to see more.  Couldn't connect on the emotional level. The fact there was 1 joke in the whole movie definitely not a plus too."
"Jul 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,This movie was so fake it is not even funny. Waste of 2 1/2 hours.
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,no real complaints here. was waiting to sigh out loud and say this sucks. but it doesn't.
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie maybe had too much violence and action scenes but I think it had some quality in it's story. It really pulled me in. But hopefully it will be better in Man of Steel 2.
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,GREAT REBOOT FOR THIS ICON!!! SAW IT 4 TIMES....GREAT EVERY TIME!!! A MUST SEE FOR ALL MOVIE YOERS!!!!
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,Better than I expected. But I had very low expectations!
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Henry Caviill is far and away the best Superman of the lot.  However, the movie is too engrossed in redefining and restating Superman's origin and focusing on alien aircraft.  It's great to have Superman back on the scene, Superman II will be better."
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,I think it's a great movie. I saw it once with my wife and later took the kids to see it. I'll buy the Bluray when it comes out too.
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,Acton all the way. Used to be you think a man can fly
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,Its ok typical superman movie
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"A typical Christopher Nolan film, dark and character focused. If you loved the Dark Knight trilogy, this film is for you."
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"good film, poor character development and slow story, action scenes make up for it. coulda been better"
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,I've always hated superman however this movie has changed my opinion of him by showing off an interesting side to the superman lore. The details they put into this movie where truly astonishing and the cast did an excellent job especially Henry Cavill (Clark) and Michael Shannon (Zod). A must see for summer movies :)
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,Don't be a hatter... it wasn't bad.
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,Was ok nothing exciting...
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"Despite the gratuitous fight senes, lens flare and not-so-subtle pro-American overtones, it's a totally decent reboot."
"Jul 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,Beautifully shot with Zack Snyder's trademark style all over the place. But the story wasn't enticing enough which makes the movie feels longer than it is. Russell Crowe's performance as Jor El was brilliant though.
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"Excellent take on the franchise. Henry Cavil is the man, Superman."
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,Excellent malgr√© quelques longueurs.
"Jul 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,It was just okay. I probably wouldn't watch it again. So many explosions (really how many times can the world be ripped apart by aliens)? At times it drug. At no point did I feel any emotional connection to the characters. There was a lot of opportunity to make this a feel good story - I personally like to root for the good guy and it just wasn't there. Meh. This after seeing it in Imax with 2 boys who love super heroes. Not that great.
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"Fantastic, hoping and praying for a JLA Movie in the future!"
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome Movie. Loved it. Now waiting for the release to buy.
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A ver... digamos que es la pel√≠cula que me amig√≥ con el sujeto un poco, porque es entretenida, visualmente se zarpa, tiene un buen relato sobre los or√≠genes y porque este Superman en particular est√° extremadamente bueno. Ahora, sigo pensando lo mismo del ""superh√©roe"" en cuesti√≥n - y es culpa suya, √©l sigue resolviendo los problemas tir√°ndolos en alg√∫n agujero negro en alg√∫n espacio -, y adem√°s en esta entrega en particular SE EXCEDEN con las alegor√≠as de Superman = Jesucristo. yo me sigo quedando con un superh√©roe m√°s real (Si, Batman, obvio :P)"
"Jul 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This 'new' update of the old Superman story gets a reboot with striking visual CGI, explosions, big guns & an evil Shannon unleashing it all. Now does that make the film awesome...oh boy far from it! The story felt flat as can be, pretty much the whole film is about chatting then the last 30"" packs so much explosions, battle & action scenes that you get lost is the ocean of CGI. Most of the cast is doing ok, Cavill is very wooden & accentuate the flatness of the film. Crowe, Lane & Costner add a little humanity to this big blockbuster but in the end, I felt terribly bored & not that entertained.... The Man of Steel? more like the man who steale my money @ the movies....yeah."
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Not a bad effort, but wish there was a little more depth to the characters. Can't fault Henry Cavill's acting. General Zod was more annoying than intimidating for a villain. Terrence Stamp played him better in Superman II (1980). Opening was awesome saving people as an anonymous hero. But The film lost its way a little and felt kind of rushed at the end. Would have been better if there was more emotional content to drive the story, and if there was a bit of a cliffhanger to build on a sequel...Still like how they modernised the effects,and changed aspects of the story."
"Jul 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,"generic and boring cgi war. too many elements stolen from better films: youth drama from batman begins, aliens coming to conquer/terraform earth (transformers); also very bad and boring pseudo-explanations (what the heck does thinner atmosphere / lower gravity has to do with superhuman melt sight)"
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Much better than expected.  Not a lot of teen angst, which helped a lot.  The tone is much different from the Marvel films, which is as it should be.."
"Jul 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This was a disappointment for me. Although Henry Cavill looked pretty perfect, the script was abismal. There were no charming moments! Plus that fight scene went on like 20 mins too long. Despite this poor showing, if they do another film, I hope that they lighten it up a bit and make the script meatier."
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"OK. Yes I give it four stars, BUT...Its too long and the destruction makes you look for Michael Bay in the credits. Its too much! Less really can be more. It got four stars from me because of Henry Cavill and Amy Adams. Henry Cavill just may be the best Superman - ever. I know. Thats huge but I just saw it a second time to wrap my head around this review and he is soooo Superman. And I really do like that they made Lois have some balls. I mean she is a Pulitzer prize winning reporter. It will be very interesting to see where they go with this franchise."
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A darker superman tale than the one people are used to, but aren't all Christopher Nolan movies.  A lot of CGI, and was worth the price of admission to see on the IMAX.  I like it better than the Christopher Reeves superman."
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel was a welcome return from the All-American Hero. With heart, action, comedy and thrills, this was a very well-done modern marvel."
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"The critics were right, but yet wrong. Yes, it's very destructive and sure it's not the most happy film,( but it certainly isn't the Dark Knight trilogy) but it is entertaining. And when it comes down to it that's what makes a movie good."
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,Unbelievable movie absolute must see!!
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Saw it last weekend at an IMAX 3D Theatre.   Not bad, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I expected to."
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"The Superman movie I have been waiting for!  Superman Returns (2006) does not compare. This movie did a great job with the background and past of Superman. It's ending sets up for Man of Steel 2 (which has been announced). Keep and eye out for a few ""Easter eggs""! I totally recommend this movie"
"Jul 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,"What was THAT??????? Superman , they made you terrible :////"
"Jul 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Tr√®s tr√®s d√©cevant... Surench√®re d'effets speciaux qui donne le tournis, acteurs qui surjouent et d√©cribilisent completement le film, doublage fran√ßais horrible... Les sc√®nes s'enchaienent parfois sans liens entre elles.. J'ai failli dormir.. Bref"
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I'm not familiar with Superman, but this movie was pretty entertaining with one huge fist fight."
"Jul 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,Not really interesting; i was so dissipointed
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,All in all good movie. This has a lot of potential! Though it has a lot of flaws. Ps Russell Crow is a boss in this
"Jul 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Eye candy, yes. Great cinematography, yes. Story, nah."
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Man of Steel certainly does not reach the dramatic heights of The Dark Knight, but it packs enough massive action sequences to be a worthwhile ""What should we do this afternoon?"" movie."
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,"well done, screwed with the continuity a little...could have done better casting, but still a movie worth watching..."
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"The latest film from the increasingly popular superhero genre of action films is, big surprise, a gritty reboot of one of the most beloved superheroes of all time, Superman.  Notice I used the word ""Superman"" there.  That's because that's the name we all know and love him as.  Not that'd you'd know by watching Man of Steel, where the caped crusader is referred to as Superman only once in the film's 2.5 hour long run time.  Throughout the film he either referred to as Kal-El, the alien that was sent here as a way to show the people of earth his amazing possibility of greatness, or Clark Kent, a surprisingly passive guy that struggles through childhood and suffers great isolation in his adult years.  As you can probably tell, this film is far from light hearted.  It has next to no humor and is almost devoid of trivial conversation.  Buildings are either being torn apart or people are whispering intensely at one another about what the future may bring.  It's fantastic.

The key to going to see this film is recognizing it for what it is.  It is a stylishly directed, character driven drama with super intense and highly visual battle scenes.  Do not go in expecting jokes about Superman's ability to see through women's clothes.  There is no light-hearted fun to be had in this movie.  It is heavy-handed and completely serious.  The movie starts with Superman's birth and ends with him joining the daily planet.  There is no Lex Luther.  It is an origin story in every sense of the word.  It shows you how Superman outed himself to the world and the trails it took to save it.  It contains absolutely no fluff.

Now some of you may be reading this and thinking to yourself, ""well that's all fine and dandy, but where's the action?""  Well my fine hypothetical friend, you will be in for quite a treat.  Man of Steel boasts some of the best action scenes I've ever seen.  The film's intro boasts a space fight that would make James Cameron blush.  Things explode, ships collide and all the while Superman's Dad dukes it out with the bad guys.  The final act features Superman locked in an intense battle with the film's main villain with both men flying through the air and crashing into buildings.  Watching it in IMAX 3D, my jaw about hit the floor.  I was in heaven.  I still haven't recovered since.

Man of Steel is by no means a great movie.  It should not be considered for best picture by the time February rolls around.  It is however, a solid movie, a killer blockbuster and a cool and stylish new twist on an old story.  I can't wait for the sequel.

"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,perfect....in every way.....as a true comic fan......all the stupid and nonsense of the old superman story is gone....the  cgi is perfect....the skin the hair....not a drop of cartoonish crap you get in the old films.....its dark like tru life....superman suffers like a tru human....thank you for finally giving us a true superman story.....
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I'm actually glad they dealt with his history through brief flashbacks.  The effects and fight scenes were better than I expected.  Minimizing the shaky cam effect would have been quite welcome in my opinion.  I didn't get too riled up with the killing of Zod as much as other people have so it wasn't a deal breaker for me.  I think it was a gamble on the part of the director to give superman a well grounded reason for his ""no killing"" principle which he should uphold in the future.  I'd still go back and watch it and the sequel (I they make one, and maybe even a JLA movie!).  Overall, I say it was worth the time and money to watch it in IMAX, but the 3D wasn't so evident though."
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"I freaking loved this movie. 

Need I say more?"
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,its an amazing movie with superb action sequences
"Jul 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,It was good at the begging then the rest sucked the end awesome
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,Good film but dare I say too many special effects
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"Keep in mind, it's a darker rendition of the superman story. If you're expecting a happy 1978 version, you aren't getting it."
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie really adds to the man (alien) behind the hero. I loved all the imagery related to the church because it deals with morals in our society. It was very refreshing to see this coming out of Hellywood.
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Not what i expected, it seemed abit jumbled up but looks as tho the next one could be the start x"
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,Great and action packed. A little long so get ready. It's a different movie than Iron Man and Avengers. Little bit of humor. Not as much as Marvel.
"Jul 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I just kept wondering, ""who's going to pay for all that damage to Metropolis?"" and ""Clark Kent is going to work for a newspaper?  They still have those?"""
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,El Superman que dejo de ser Boy Scout
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"More action, more destruction, a real villain, and a darker yet familiar story! Basically the new Superman movie we've been waiting for!!!"
"Jul 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,all I.felt. this movie did.was smash in walls fir 2 hours mostly a waste of time I think it didn't have a lot of story. I really think this was a waste of time it doesn't deserve 2 stars I have no idea why I gave it that I'm going to change it.
"Jul 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Everything about this film was great except for the character they wanted us to accept as Superman. The film was visually stunning, and all the character development necessary for an enriching and inspired transition were there, but Zack Snyder never converted that backstory into the ""moment"" when the alien with the ""S"" on his chest, BECOMES Superman. The film is ultimately without heart, or passion. It's just beige."
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"The best special effects all year, blows all the marvel comics out the water the lone rivalay be thore in that catagory this my friends was a must see in my opinion and I would pay to see it over and over!"
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,amazing lots of action I would want to see it in 3d
"Jul 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Casting was superb.  I expect my superman to be more of an ass kicker.   Movie dragged at some points and the final fight scene was wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy to long.  Overall, I liked the movie."
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,Really good best movie of the year!!!
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,One of if not the best superhero origin stories on film. The critics seemed to hammer this film because its not like the 1978 campy Superman the movie with bad puns and effects. Man of Steel has great acting including Henry Cavill who was born to play superman and unbelievable special effects. This is the Superman movie I've been waiting for and can't wait to see whats next (hopefully a World's Finest with Christian Bale).
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,i think this is the best superman movie made.  first time i see superman at full potential; not just trying to fall in love with the reporter.  this movie shows his difficulties to adapt to humans and how he is seen by humans.  telling his story and the fight scene are excellent.
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"A superb reboot of the Superman canon, with wonderful visuals and action whilst still resonating with the internal struggles and emotional conflicts of one of our most beloved superheroes. The supporting cast is certainly strong, although the big names might be a tad distracting for some. Henry Cavill is perfectly cast for this role and his performance comes through just fine as the Kryptonian misfit with a greater destiny. Amy Adams is not quite as sassy as the Lois Lanes that came before, but is decidedly likeable and even manages to hold her own in the action department. We can finally move on from the tragedy of the last reboot with renewed hope."
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,too long. Thought that the smallville story was drawn out but it was so awesome.
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,I thought Cavill did a great job. Agree with some that the female roles were a bit pandering.  Adams has shined before but must have been held back. A few too many throwaway scenes but worth the time
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie was great I honestly don't understand what some of these critics or people are talking about. It's disgusting that the previous superman had better critic reviews. This movie is a must see. Too much action?! That's like saying the movie was too good.
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,Good movie but the back story was too long to develop a plot.
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel was great. Unexpected since I dislike Zack Snyder but the story, action, VFX, music and Cavill make it the best Superman movie."
"Jul 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Plot line was underdeveloped.  Action sequences were long and too intense from start to finish, failing to build tension.  I never found myself on the edge of my seat.  Good performances from the cast."
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Superman or Man Of Steel is the new remake of the hit comic book were a man can fly & save people's lives. ""Its a bird its a plane......O no its superman"" - 

I tell you what if they combined the old version & the new one together it could of been better."
"Jul 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Flat! Backwards! Absolutely no build up of character relationships so you just didn't care. Stupid stupid lines between Superman and Lois, unbelievable really."
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,Easily the Best Superman film yet.
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"I thought it was a fantastic movie. Yes, it would have been nice to learn a bit more about Superman, but I think we will get a chance to know the man in the suit in forthcoming movies. Everything from the camera work to the many fight scenes was brilliant. The villains were very well cast, and Michael Shannon was made for his role as General Zod. A guy with (arguably) the right motives, who goes about saving his people the wrong way (does that remind you of anyone? Hint - Nelson Van Alden). As Zod said, he was trained to be a soldier, and that is all he knows, and it's nice to see a villain with a bit of depth, who doesn't just want to blow up the world because he's bored. I definitely enjoyed watching Zod a lot more than I did watching Bane in The Dark Knight Rises. So what if Superman kills a guy, as if Iron Man has never killed anyone. That is the dark reality we are all faced with. Like us Superman has to make tough choices, and it would be foolish to think that someone with as much power as he possesses would never kill his enemies if it was truly for the greater good."
"Jul 2, 2013",POSITIVE,The casting is spot on but I wanted more story and a little less action.  It seemed the movie was all action all the time.  Sadly for me Superman will always be Christopher Reeve.
"Jun 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Very loud and bombastic, this is a gritty reimagining of the superman story. Action sequences are well made and exciting but are a bit drawn out. The pacing of the movie makes it feel as if we hit the ending a few times but it keeps on going. I think because the over the too action sequences each feel like the climax on its own."
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,Man of Steel packs a heavy punch and delivers on all levels. It is the best superman movie so far.
"Jun 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Nothing but a pretty face, a little disappointed by the story line and how rushed it was."
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Take the red underwear and the forehead curl from Superman, make him frown all the time and stick it in a mix of 'Independence Day' and 'Matrix Revolutions'. You will get 'Man of Steel'. Still considering whether this was a Superman movie at all, because you could swap the main character with any other and you'll get the same movie. Even the ""S"" in the chest wasn't really an ""S"".

PS: It's been some time since I started to be a little fed up of Hans Zimmer. And his drummer too, probably."
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,man of steel was awesome
"Jun 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,"First part of movie was lame, but loved the action on earth!"
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I'm very disappointed. Unlike Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight, this movie has no plot to speak of and is way too long and boring to watch."
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"This was a great movie, a bit long but a great reintroduction to Superman."
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,very different. the best yet. the start was good. with sups dad on their world. the new superman was the star in another movie called the immortals. he is physically capable not just a pretty boy. -- for the guys.  I will buy this one. enjoy.
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,when do we get a Justice league. I think we are ready for one.
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie was AWESOME!!
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,It amazing action and to care tell them and safe too ;) i want to see more and with batman too
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,best superman movie I've seen especially in imax 3d. the story fits better than the original telling although Christopher Reeves will always be the original superman Henry Cavill does an amazing job filling the superheroes boots.
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,Who am I to say whether you will like this film or not.
"Jun 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,The first hour of the movie dragged on and wasn't interesting.  The action was okay but overall I was a bit disappointed at the whole story plot. I guess I was just expecting too much from it.
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"Enjoyable and entertaining, though the fighting scenes at the last half hour were really an overkill.  Less is more sometimes.  Henry Cavill certainly looks the part  - good looks and all."
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"This must be the best Superman movie I've seen, which isn't saying much considering how all the others sucked. Still, very entertaining. All the fanboys will hate it for sure."
"Jun 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,Fun evening:D 3D action at the end bit of a blur!! But on whole liked!
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,The Best Superman movie to date... Nolan's touch is very much appreciated ;)
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"The best Superman flick in a long time. The best villain of any Superman movie as well, thanks to Michael Shannon."
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,A much better version then 2006. Henry Cavill is very good in this depiction.
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,Just spent two hours of my life I will never get back watching the biggest load of tripe. Superman fought with criminal humans NOT aliens from his planet. Too long and over the top with CGIs. I should have known better seeing Christopher Nolan was invloved! I will never watch another of his efforts again!!
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie has done what every other Superman movie has failed to do which is displaying why Superman is considered one of the strongest heroes in the DC universe. Other movies wasted time attempting to make him human, which he is not. He is impervious to almost everything, he can fly, he has super human strength, etc. This movie does an excellent job of bringing this to light. He is a superior being who must conceal his abilities, not a human who has been granted abilities."
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"The best ever... it's not 1978 anymore, we all know the story about his childhood, and critics are bored.... Snyder does an amazing job with his vision and I am happy with this story and the fight scenes are Awesome... I want more"
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"excellent prequel for Superman.
special effects were phenomenal and I will likely see it again."
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,"When I saw the trailer For ""Man of Steel"" almost a year ago, I was really excited. I thought that since Christopher Nolan was involved with the production of this movie that it would be just fine. One year later, I was shocked to hear the terrible reviews for this movie. I ended up going to see the movie, but realized that I should have read more reviews. The movie was terrible, I knew it was going to stink from the first ten minutes. The movie had; little character development, too much CGI, mindless action, and no humor at all. If you really want to see this movie, I recommend renting it from one of those vending machines at the grocery store for a buck. 
Verdict: (Over rated 0.5/10)"
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,"While much better than Superman Returns and not without interesting aspects, Man of Steel is overall rather dull and without any sort of emotion or characterization from Superman."
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,Good movie. Action from the start. New take on the beginnings of kal el but it worked for me. Good choice for superman.
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,"All superhero stories must need a foundation. We've seen the story of Bruce Wayne/Batman told by Christopher Nolan & David Goyer. And now they've given us a foundation for Superman. However, they've entrusted the direction into the hands of Zack Snyder. The Man of Steel departs from its previous installments by giving us a berserk, ear-splitting, CGI loaded, and recklessly daring graduation of a film."
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie through and through. Though it is a tid bit cliche at times. An enjoyable movie for sure. A one and done though.
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,Beyond epic in my opinion!  Loved it!
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is the sort of superhero movie that I love, a perfect blend between the more conventional Marvel-esque flick with the critically acclaimed Batman series. While the mood definitely does have a Chris Nolan feel to it, Man of Steel is also action-packed and at times hilarious. Snyder does a masterful job at the action scenes, especially the final aerial battle. The movie could be faulted for touching on too many subjects, but I think it is the only way to make the film meaningful and not seem shallow. The themes of Earth VS Krypton and Kal's relationship with his father(s) has been a subject that is as old as the story superman itself, and it is presented solidly in this rendition. I am concerned with how the film will be moving forward, as I can already sense the sequel being about Lex Luthor and Kryptonite once again, let's just hope it doesn't ruin the series completely."
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"The most human recounting of the Superman tale I have seen.  It's basically a back-story to the real action where Superman saves the world repeatedly etc. and nicely done.  He throws his lot in with the humans, which cheers everyone.  Yeahhhhh!!!!!"
"Jun 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This movie drags on. It never moved me emotionally and several times I thought to myself, ""when will this end."" The whole movie was spectacle and no characters were really developed. I never had hate for any of the bad guys and it made me angry how much destruction the lead hero causes. The story is very boring and many times I felt they compared superman to jesus. Plot 5, character 3, theme 3, music 6, language 4, spectacle 9."
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"Snyder has created a visually spectacular rendition of the Superman mythos. Solid cast all round. Would have liked to have seen a little more Clark and Lois interaction, but that is what sequels are for, I guess. The great score, some brilliant framing and editing, and a likeable Superman places this movie above your average blockbuster fare. There's a lot to process in Man of Steel, which is why I will enjoy returning to it."
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,Terrible movie. 'Superman Returns' was better than this movie. There were extended fight scenes between supermam and the kryptonians who were also incincible. They were throwing each other through buildings and nothing would happen to the kryptonians or superman. It was just destruction for the sake of destruction. It was so stupid. I like my superman to be out saving people.
"Jun 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,Superman's big reboot isn't bad but it lacks humor and the mammoth action scenes are too long. The tender drama parts work much better. Hans Zimmer should take a break from hero scores!
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"Fantastic movie.  Well written, good balance of current storyline and back stories.  Best Superman movie in my book."
"Jun 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Not a superhero fan, but this was decent.  Fight sequences were way too drawn out.  I prefer the original story."
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I missed the variety of Superman saving the average Joe and by doing that - he wins the hearts of the people. Also, the Lois Lane relationship was premature. It seemed to be repeating the same battle over and over and over again."
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This movie consisted more of big explosions and smashing then anything else. Yes the CGI was good and Zak Snyder is one of the best at shooting action sequences, but there was very little emotional connection to what was going on on-screen for the audience. Even the character development flashbacks for Superman seem forced and contrived. As far the action in the movie, the last hour is basically the equivalent of a 5-year old kid smashing his action figures together in a city made of LEGOs. It's so over the top that you become desensitized to the awesome action that's occuring on-screen and you go numb. At one point they go up in space and start smashing each other on a sattelite and I'm thinking ""Sure, why the hell not?!"" because I've lost any sense of an emotional connection to the movie and just want to see things go smashy smash. I used to watch The Adventures of Batman and Superman cartoon a lot growing up and this movie is completely different from what I remembered about Superman. It feels like you're watching a sci-fi alien movie, a super hero movie, and War of the Worlds all rolled into one and it's a bit jarring.

I will give credit to Henry Cavill for playing an excellent version of Superman. He had the demeanor, humanity, as well as the look for the part. But there was almost no chemistry between him and Lois Lane who was played by Amy Adams. She did a good job in her own right with her part, but in the end that doesn't make up for bad writing and direction."
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,I really liked how the story was told.  Maybe over-the-top on the fighting / graphics.  Overall much better than I thought.  I really liked the bad guys (good bad guys) and the new take on the story.  I'd recommend seeing it.
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"A movie with great action and a okay plot. It just seemed like I never was able to be captivated by the movie, since every character was static and boring."
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"It was the best loved it, lots of action, from the start to the end, loved Russell Crowe, great actors."
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,"CHEESY writing. Totally unoriginal. Overblown fight scenes with no sense of choreography. How many buildings do we need to destroy before it gets boring? I max out at about THREE. Kevin Costner is, well, Kevin Costner. As is Russell Crowe. But I liked Henry Caville's Superman--this is a more sensitive Superman than what I'm used to, but it serves to make him more adorable to women. :)"
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,Plenty of action awesome movie better than any Marvel movie
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,"bland, boring and ugly. Man Of Steel offers stale acting, overused cgi, awkward dialouge and a superman that we just dont care about."
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie!  The villain was menacing, the action was great for this generation, and Superman was without a doubt super!"
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Wow, and people complained about ""Superman Returns""? What a waste of my time. This movie was so bad, I didn't even want to finish eating my popcorn that I paid $20 (or whatever) for. I love Nolan's rendition of Batman, but ""dark"" doesn't work for Supes. Neither does ""boring"" actually. Action sequences aside, the dialogue in this flop of a movie was about as exciting and mindblowing as that of Superman IV. I'm amazed they've greenlit a sequel. Good luck to u guys at DC/Warner ... you'll need it."
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,"i hated every second of this movie. its nonlinear plot which jumped from krypton to the present to clarke's childhood and around and around made it feel like the film never really got started. i blame nolan for the script and the overload of exposition in the dialog. in 'watchmen', zac snyder managed to combine spectacle with some great characters. here we have a protagonist drowned out in a clusterfuck of special effects and fight scenes. fuck this movie."
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,"It's as if the director looked through the last 10 science-fiction movies made, listed the cons, and compiled them into one bad film."
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,Very good movie if you like suspense- extremely loud though and not good for kids
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,Better than the previous one
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I think this may be one of the worst films we have seen for a long while and reinforces how futile it often is going and seeing these big american blockbusters thinking ""this time it will be different"" - it never is. Unfortunately, no matter how much money you spend and how good the visuals and effects are, if you don't have a good script and story, you don't have a good move. This superman movie simply doesn't make sense. It's not good enough to say ""oh it's just for teenage boys"". Teenage boys will enjoy a movie more (and learn more) from a good script and story. It's disappointing to see something so bad from something with so much potential."
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Lois Lane: So what's the S stand for?
Clark Kent: Special Effects"
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,Horrible in so many ways. Amazing superman casting with no humor and/or soul what so ever. Worst villain ever (yes. Even worst than Bane)
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,A superman movie that skimps out on character development and some important plot details in order to deliver some cloverfield like shaky camera action sequences that honestly gave me a headache.
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,The perfect Superman movie.
"Jun 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,Good movie.   Fight scenes are a little long.
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"a great reboot to Superman, superb casting and good story from birth to his humble beginnings as a reporter :) the story was a lil long-winded but very well done, overall."
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"This reboot of Superman is was needed. This was a great re telling of the Kryptonian. The introduction with Russell Crowe as Jor-El fighting against a civil war and trying to save his race was a great addition to the origin story since it was talked about but never shown. The Superman franchise needed an injection of action and Zack Snyder gave it ten-fold. I'm also glad they did not focus the romance between Lois and Clark as the central story. This needed to be a gritty, modern re telling of Superman and Snyder and Co. delivered. Cannot wait for the sequel!"
"Jun 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Fine acting all around. New Superman actor is perfect. The story was a bit too much action and weak on plot. Better than Superman 3 and 4, not as good as Christopher Reeve's first two. I also thought the last Superman with Routh was better than this one. I would have preferred a sweeter ""coming out"" story for Superman, like Reeves's first movie. But I guess they wanted a more conflicted Superman for a more cynical age, and they wanted the action to be immediately intense. Also, I sat in one of those D-Box moving seats. Honestly, that was nothing more than a d-baggish anxiety inducer. 
I hope they make more Superman movies, and I hope they use the same actors, but I also hope it's better next go-round."
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"For me... epic is a good word, dark (maybe a little too dark, needed a little more humour). But all main players, especially Cavill & Crowe where excellent!, story was good, interesting... but destruction and chaos took center stage... overall, certainly the best Superman in years and I cannot wait for MOSII. By the way, look closely at the scene where Superman flies up to blow up the space ship on the Indian Ocean... he has got Christopher Reeves face... (I heard about it online, and it is true, very visible), watch out for the LEXCORP trucks too...."
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,expected much more. pretty crap
"Jun 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,Too Long and way too much stupid fighting. The story line was actually very good. It got a 3 because in trying to make it a summer blockbuster they the fighting looked like it was just added into the film actually adding nothing.
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,Tis is a Superman movie for the 21st century
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,It was beautiful. they did a fantastic job on the reboot. laid the foundation for future amazing Superman movies
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"It is so massive and superb, its hard to imagine a sequel that will be greater much less equal to it."
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,Loved this movie! So did my wife and 15 year old son...
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,I have always hate it Superman and I still hate Superman
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Pointless useless film that is all spectacle that you just don't care for. It's Superman 1&2 meets Transformers 1 & 2 all rolled into 1 film. It's a masterpiece painting, looks great, sounds great but after looking at all the details you don't care and will forget about it hours later."
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,Fantastic Movie! Henry Cavill's portrayal of Superman is spectacular
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Once you've got past the dazzling CGI, what's left of this film really doesn't pack a punch."
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,Man of Steel is corroded....not stainless at all.
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"The movie was phenomenal, an absolutely great superhero movie. This movie doesn't bore with too much character development (aka talking like dark Knight rises) it instead takes u on a hell of roll coaster ride of the man known as Clark Kent/Superman. The soundtrack, dialogue, storyline, and sequences were all top notch. People who are giving this a bad rating is because they miss the old superman movies feel, well they forget that out of the last 5 Superman movies the last three were terrible. The man of steel is one of the best, if not they best, super hero movie ever made!!"
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,Nolan should remake all the Super Hero movies.
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"Different to the ""Superman"" story I grew up with. 

I loved the fact that for the first time we see his pain and difficulties of adapting to Earth 
and the choices he had to make.

I liked the different role given to Lois Lane and Amy Adams was great!

Henry Cavill's portrayal was superb. 
In my opinion, he's the best Superman yet."
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,I love Superman & finally underwear inside.
"Jun 29, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The challenge of a reboot/prequel to a long running, well known story is to withdraw from the audience the knowledge that they are watching a movie of which they technically know the ending. Man of Steel gives it a shot but just does not manage to pull it off as well as the recent Batman reboot. The film manages to give a couple of twists that mainly work due to the emotion that Henry Cavill gave his role. It obviously tried hard to hit the mark of great story telling, but fell short, instead relying on absurd quantities of collateral damage and fruitless highlights of mankinds' paranoia and xenophobia. The conclusion involved no complaint or mention of the destruction done to the city nor the thousands of lives probably lost and has Clark Kent join society, no one noticing that he is the Man of Steel due to his donning a pair of spectacles."
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,?zledi?im en iyi s√ºperkahraman filmi. S√ºpermen de adam gibi olmu?. 5 kere izlerim!! <3
"Jun 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The hardest challenge in bringing a new Superman film to the big screen was seperating it from the Superman movies of the past. Snyder, Goyer & Nolan to their credit achieved this goal and with strong performances from Henry Cavill, Michael Shannon, Russell Crowe & a show stealing Kevin Cosner this movie should have been so much better. Spoilers from here on out! 

I'll start with Krypton. We've never seen an indepth look at Kal-Els homeworld on film before and to be honest it should have stayed that way. While the CGI was impressive it didnt look like anything we hadnt seen before, looking as though it had been plucked from a galaxy far, far away. Now onto the part of the film that really pissed me off for a good forty five minutes. The flashbacks. One minute we're watching a twenty something Clark working on a ship. The next minute we're watching a baby Clark with his new parents. Then we're watching the twenty something Clark before we're watching a teenage Clark pushing a school bus full of kids out of a river. Then Amy Adams Lois Lane turns up and starts snooping around & then we are watching baby Clark getting picked on in school. 

Im a huge fan of origin stories, but they simply do not work in a flashback sequence & what we are left with is a huge mess where its hard to keep up with whats going on. After discovering a spaceship Clark has a convosation with a hologram of his father Jor-El. Two minutes later Clark is Superman. No questions asked. Even though he actually says to his father that he has 'So many questions' ... And basicly from here on out the film just turns into a stereo-typical action film. The bad guys turn up, start blowing things up & even though Superman promises to defend humanity from Zod and his invading warriors, during the scuffle they manage to wreck half a city and a little town called Smallville (Which they make no reference to). 

The film comes to a close with Superman vs Zod and while their fight is quite entertaining the finale is both shocking & brutal as Superman snaps Zods neck like a twig. Two things bothered me about this. One, Superman doesnt have a lot of big name villans to go up against and killing off his biggest enemy in the first film was a poor choice. Two, since when does Superman snap peoples necks! A hero thats a murderer!? 

Rumour has it the DC Universe has started here with Man of Steel. I hope this turns out to be true and if so this is a good start to their cinematic universe, but there is a lot of room for improvement"
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,entertaining dark science-fiction
"Jun 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Some people just don't know when to stop. Zack Snyder, director of this new Superman movie, is one of those. With films like 300 and Watchmen in his past we can't say we don't know what to expect. A slightly surreal comic book aesthetic, stylised destruction and violence, a lack of humour and a very loud soundtrack with Wagnerian pretensions. I'll be honest: I haven't enjoyed his previous films. Hopes were higher here, though - not least because Christopher Nolan is the producer and co-writer. If anyone could reign Snyder's excesses in, its the man who can handle huge budgets, gargantuan expectations and big stars and still produce something exciting, commercially successful and that's still artistically and intellectually satisfying.

The result is Snyder's best film. To put that in context, it's possibly the worst film that Nolan has put his name to in any form. Granted, in this age of dark superhero reinventions, Superman was always going to present a challenge. He's too easy to poke fun at - red underpants outside the trousers, flying and an enemy called Zod. Seriously.

Snyder deals with this by constantly cutting back to Superman's back story. Whether it's his origins on Krypton born to Russel Crowe or his Earth-bound childhood of self-discovery with his father Kevin Costner these scenes are handled well. Lois Lane is the reporter trying to unearth if the elusive rescuer of people in danger is an urban myth, a figment of her imagination or an alien. All of this works well - it's exciting, occasionally moving, and well handled. Crowe and Costner are especially well cast.

Where the film strays is with a distinct lack of wit and the climactic, seemingly endless battle with Zod. The missing wit and humour is notable because of the two scenes where it actually exists: one brilliant visual gag after a narrowly avoided bar-fight when Superman is still trying to remain anonymous; the other when he teaches himself to fly   - a scene which pops with exhilaration, grins and joy. In the aftermath of those you realise you haven't smiled at all otherwise, and probably won't. Snyder, crashing orchestral soundtrack and buildings together, wants to ram the portentous events down our throats, to see profound parallels, to take it all Seriously. We can't. Because it's too much and too long. The supposedly serious parallels (puberty, religion, identity) are so po-faced they wash over us; the wit so minimal we never have the chance to have fun. Christopher Nolan showed in his Batman trilogy that you can do serious superhero movies and still have fun; if he tried to teach Snyder this, then he didn't get his point across.

British unknown Henry Cavill does a decent job in the lead role; he certainly looks the part and manages to invest the character with a modicum of depth. It's a shame, that for all the bombast and spectacle, that's lacking in the rest of the movie. When an actor of Richard Schiff's skill is reduced to a few scenes where he stands and gawps, you've missed an opportunity. It's not a bad film; there is much to enjoy. It just would have been so much the better 45 minutes shorter and with a sense of control. Here's hoping the inevitable sequel learns the a little less could leave us much more satisfied."
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,"Still the lamest cover for a superhero but I'm glad they did away with the red undies. Also feeling ambivalent about a superhero that destroys most of Metropolis while  ""defending"" people."
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,Hottest superman ever!
"Jun 29, 2013",POSITIVE,I love this movie so much...can't see why people hate on it:
"Jun 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,Action scene way too long... And unrealistic...
"Jun 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I would give this movie a 7/10.  I am glad I went to see it in the movie theater.  I am in my thirties and Superman was my first Super hero.  It is tough to make everyone happy with a story line but overall they did good.  The movie is overdone with action scenes that do not improve the movie.  There is too much comparison between Jesus and Superman, and I wish they would have subtracted that part and added humor.  The movie lacks humor, which is a extremely important human condition that allows for suspension of disbelief.  I do not consider it as dark as some are referring to, but it is depressed in the mood (surrendering to man kind is a lesser evil than surrendering to Zod).  It is not as good as Dark Knight, but it is worth watching.  There are some cool moments in the movie.  One of the most important requirements in a super hero style movie for me is simple I need to love the hero and want to rip the villain's head off, and this movie met the this requirement for me.  The storyline is good enough to support sequels, and I would give them a chance if they use this move as a platform. 

Special Effects 10/10
Casting 10/10
Storyline 7/10
Humor 0/10
Substance (creating feeling/emotion for the viewer) 3/10
Love Story (lacks chemistry) 3/10

"Jun 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,Great fast paced movie.saw it in 3D.loved it
"Jun 28, 2013",POSITIVE,Best superman movie made ever
"Jun 28, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie is to the other Superman movies, like The Dark Knight movies was to the Batman movies of the 80s and 90s including Superman Returns. I know it was a long time coming but was defiantly worth the wait. That is all. (29/6/2013) Cinema."
"Jun 28, 2013",POSITIVE,"Don't understand the people who didn't like it. I am a lifelong Superman fan. I freaking loved this movie. It is a sci fi movie for the first half of it. There was more action in this movie than any of the precious Superman movies combined. It was fantastic. 

Cavill is great as Superman, and although the relationship with Lois was a little rushed, it sets up for what will hopefully be many more movies. 

Don't listen to the naysayers, go see this movie!"
"Jun 28, 2013",POSITIVE,"I am beginning to Lose hope in humanity. All the ""critics"" and people who gave this movie a bad score are lacking color and has begun to revert to the age of black and white. This movie Was A perfect movie, Despite its imperfections. And it's funny how people think supermans first real fight wouldn't be out of control and massive. It was his First fight. And yea, people died but the world survived. Stop putting superman on pedestal in a dark room and shine some light on the fact that In order for Superman To really fight an enemy, his enemy has to be as strong as him, other wise he would simply squash them. Thus, a real fight with superman will not simply destroy one single building and thats it, expect a town to be blown away in the process because that is The reality. And The directors did A good job in pointing That out. Another Thing that is Really Bothering me, is That people compare This superman from This movie to another superman from another movie or comic. Just stop and give this movie The Justice That it Deserves. It gives its own touch to The lore of superman and it Did A good job. Even If you thought This movie Wasnt perfect, it Doesnt deserve anything below 80 percent. That is the truth. The movie Was well down despite its imperfection. The problem is the lack of color. You people are dull. 
(alot of typos, i had to type on my phone. Hope you understand the message though)"
"Jun 28, 2013",POSITIVE,An epic superhero movie that was delivered with an emotional and ominous direction...thoroughly enjoyed it!
"Jun 28, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I kept thinking, this is more like a video game. I didn't see much of a superman story--just a lot of alien combat.  Devoid of emotion. But he looked hot with his beard in the beginning...  The action was too much---not for me."
"Jun 28, 2013",NEGATIVE,Yet another disappointing superman movie.
"Jun 28, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The Man of Steel was the biggest let down in recent deteriorating Hollywood superhero flicks which have slowly become increasingly similar to Bollywood and Tamil movies. By far this was the worst Superman movie. It was overdone, too much of overplayed protracted scenes of overwhelming violence (America it seems keeps reliving 911 in almost every movie these days), weak storyline. Zod and his troupe were falling over themselves trying to act the bad guys part and ""the man of Steel"", well there was nothing steely about his depiction of the role and the role itself missed a great opportunity to reignite the 1978 classic. If you hav'nt watched it, consider yourself lucky. The only saving grace was some solid acting by Kevin Cosner and Russel Crowe. Apart from that, the movie is as windy as the popcorn you need to consume to stay focussed on a movie obsessed with misplaced violence and rhetorical homilies."
"Jun 28, 2013",NEGATIVE,"As a longtime fan of the Superman franchise I was looking forward to the latest flick for quite a long time. I entered the movie hall with a lot of high hopes and was in for a good time.  However I was bound to be disappointed. I found 'Man of Steel"" seriously lacking emotional depth and the plot too was unsatisfying. The entire story of Superman is portrayed from the destruction of planet Krypton (Superman's original home) to his younger days of living as an outcast on Earth and finally Clark (superman) accepting himself and how humans accept him as their Savior after he saves them from an apocalyptic attack. Now anyone who reads DC Superman Comics (like me) or any person who at least knows a little about Superman will know for sure that he is actually an alien; an outsider who does not belong to Earth. This has been a subject time and again for Superman stories making us, the audience, empathize for the young man who in spite of having god-like abilities is plagued with loneliness and detachment from the rest. His superhuman gifts turn out to be a curse for him making him feel like a freak among the humans. And ""Man of Steel"" is no exception. Young Clark Kent discovers that he has superhuman powers and when his dad Jonathan Kent tells him about how he found him, Clark ventures on a journey to find who he really is and where he came from. The tried and tested idea of self-discovery and finding who one truly is forms the core of the story of ""Man of Steel"". Throw in some malicious villains and 3D visual effects and the movie is bound to soar. However the plot has too many flaws and gaps which are hard to overlook. We all know that Superman is a kind of enigma for the people but ""Man of Steel"" has just too many 'enigmas' with a lot unexplained. How on Earth did Clark end up in Antarctica or wherever the unidentified object was which was supposed to be a top secret? How did the ship have a pre designed costume err garment for Clark? If only I had superman like power would I be able to get into the mind of the story writer and get the answers. Unfortunately I being a mere mortal can only wonder and feel unsatisfied. The only back up to the movie was the action which came to life in the second half. However the action too was clique with buildings falling down and the same kind of scenes which I must have seen in almost every superhuman movie.  This makes me think if superheroes are even worth it with the amount of destruction they cause.  Anyways back to ""Man of Steel"" which failed to leave any impact. The bottom line is that the movie just ends up being a blue print to what it really could have been. As I left the hall I felt unhappy about how superman who is supposed to be a symbol of hope had crushed all my hopes of a good movie experience and the only 'steel' to this ""Man of Steel"" was its 3D action but was otherwise hollow from within. 
This I say not as a critic but as a teenager who is a fan of Superman franchise and considers movies as an integral part. Disagree? Feel free."
"Jun 28, 2013",POSITIVE,great retelling of a classic.

"Jun 25, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Man of steel fails as a superman movie. Its Kal-El isn't the clean cut absurdly heroic and optimistic superhero that stands as a paragon even in dark times but a punch-prone building smashing brooding misanthrope in search of his own past. While the 'realistic' reboot isn't as dark and edgy as it could have been it still delves into that modern explosion-prone devastation-ready paradigm that no summer movie seems to be complete without. The beginning of the movie isn't bad, though Lois Lane seems to be jammed into just about every scene on various pretences and the 'history of krypton' bit stretches for way too long. I even liked the flashback retelling of Clark's childhood although, taken together the two narrative threads above tear a big hole right in the middle of the movie's narrative. THerefore, despite the movie being over two hours long it feels quite thin and oddly paced. THis doesn't really help the movie when it starts to go off the rails, that is, in the final 40 minutes which are just one mindless, purposeless action scene after another done with great CGI but no heart.

The movie is held afloat by its cast. Michael Shannon chews the scenery as a tragic Zod, Amy Adams puts her own postmodern spin on Lois Lane, Diane Lane fills the shoes of Ma kent well and there's a host of classic typecast actors that steal the thrilling heroics from under Superman's feet in a Michael Bay-esque fashion.

Man of Steel is a CGI bonanza and a decent, if flawed retelling of the Superman origin. Zach Snyder is a competent director but one has to wonder if here the task just wasn't up to him here. It is still a decent popcorn movie, vastly superior to its PG-13 counterpart, World War Z but it is still a movie that (despite a lot of well camouflaged fan-service references) misses the mark on Superman almost entirely. Let's hope the already green lit sequel turns out better."
"Jun 25, 2013",POSITIVE,It was good action and story line.
"Jun 25, 2013",POSITIVE,"although complaints from others about the cgi, the content of the movie line and the action were great"
"Jun 25, 2013",NEGATIVE,Where do I start with this...well I was very disappointed. I don't know whether I expected too much but it was such a let down. First of all was the way the film was shot looked like a hand held camera or documentary type of filming. To much si-fi at the beginning for me. To much to-ing and fro-ing between different parts of his life and what really annoyed me e most was that Superman caused so much destruction fighting and that just wouldn't happened too many innocents would have got hurt. The one good thing was the special fx. They were amazing.
"Jun 25, 2013",POSITIVE,Great action movie. I had a few issues with the story but it was a nice return to the big screen for Superman.
"Jun 25, 2013",POSITIVE,"Fun movie!  Lots of reckless abandon and lots of destruction!  Everything a movie should be. 
One of the best Superman actors I've ever seen. He really embodied the character."
"Jun 25, 2013",POSITIVE,"Idk why this movie has a shiyty rating, it's by far the best Superman film yet. 
A must see."
"Jun 25, 2013",POSITIVE,"Wish it had more origin and father/son development, but a good reboot that tells principle-filled story and creates a character we can like and believe in."
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"I just joined Rotten Tomatoes specifically to give my thumbs down to the professional critics that essentially expected another reboot of past Superman lightweights that never managed to fill the shoes of Nolan's and Snyder's true Man of Steel. Like Bale's tormented Dark Knight, Cavill's portrayal of the conflicted Kal-El's measured maturation into his role amidst his earthly hosts is particularly credible. Epic battles with powerful nemeses are tempered by his patience, sensitivity, and the natural progression of his relationship with Lois Lane. The whimsical ""fun and romance"" desired by some has no place in Man of Steel. Reminiscent of Joker's query, ""Why so serious?"" I say simply, because it is, and it's just better that way."
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,Great beginning to Kal-Els journey!
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"In my all personal opinion, taking in consideration that I watched the very early superman movies, I must say this is by far the best movie. People could argue all they want but sometimes people need to move on with time as well."
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"An awesome reboot of the legendary superman series that couldn't have gone much better. great action scenes, an emotional back story and good acting. brilliant."
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,Lots of flashy fight scenes.
"Jun 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"First off everyone should be able to agree its probably the 3rd best Superman movie ever,(III, IV and Returns just didn't cut it).  The movie is pretty well written, the cast does a great job.  The needed to lean less on the CGI, especially with 3D it was the first time I've had a headache leaving a movie.  I know some people really upset with the ending and them pushing moral boundaries that Superman wasn't supposed to, but I feel with where this may lead it may have been necessary.  Overall I enjoyed the movie and the retelling of story with slight changes from the story we all grew up with."
"Jun 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,i wouldnt have thought a superman movie would be about an alien invasion. lots of action.
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,Was a great big hi octane popcorn flick.
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"Awesome. Lots of action, great cast, amazing vfx. They redefined Superman and he's much more interesting, flawed, and surprising to watch."
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"Pretty cool movie. It's the same kind of action you expect to see in Nolan's Batman trilogy or Marvel series. I'm not sure if the critics have been manipulated by Disney, but the movie is way better than Iron Man 3 or the last spiderman"
"Jun 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Best body slamming,  fight scenes.  It was great to see Superman fight."
"Jun 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"liked it, few bugs but liked this version, dark intense. (att. not fan of sups.)"
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,I loved everything about it; best movie I've seen in a while. i didn't like Superman but this story makes me love him.
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"A visually astonishing movie that lacks any feeling whatsoever, so your typical Zack Snyder fare."
"Jun 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,"First part was fantastic. Last hour of the movie? Ugh.... how many times does Superman fight the bad guys. Over and over (and over) again, while things explode and Amy Adams gets saved (too bad for the rest of the population of Metropolis). Ugh."
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"A superpowered spectacle that will have you believing that a Superman movie can be great! The latest reboot of the Superman mythos is certainly a fresh and dazzling start for our generation.

Since it is a reboot, the film opens with the Fall of Krypton. Jor-El and his wife give birth to a natural-born son named Kal-El. They must send off the son in hopes of preserving its legacy while General Zod, a once-respected military leader, stages an attempt to rule over Krypton despite its imminent destruction. Once Krypton is gone, Zod is confined in a military prison as Kal-El comes flying off to Earth. The film wisely intersplices his childhood as Clark Kent in Smallville, Kansas and the current events in his life as he grows up to establish his identity (Kryptonian or Earthling?) and become the superMAN he was destined to be. That won't be easy, since Lois Lane is on his trail to figure out who he is and General Zod returns to wreak havoc upon the people of Earth in hopes of bringing back Krypton.
Hands down, there are so many elements that result in this film being amazing! The familiar origin story was reworked in a unique, fascinating way that evokes both science fiction and modern times, all thanks to the abilities of Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer. The direction by Zack Snyder is commendable in incorporating the film's ideas and leaping the film forward, even taking on a more serious and down-to-earth tone that manages to work for something as light and carefree as Superman is normally depicted to be. He even adds insanely kinetic action sequences to put the cherry on top. His efforts are further assisted by a talented ensemble cast, with Henry Cavill as a dashing Superman, Amy Adams as a smart and perky Lois Lane, Michael Shannon as a crazed General Zod, Russell Crowe stealing the show as a wise Jor-El, and Kevin Costner and Diane Lane doing a remarkable job portraying the earnest, loving surrogate parents. Visually orgasmic and viscerally impeccable, this film soars to new heights in blockbuster territory. And yet another amazing score from Hans Zimmer here. What could've been a rote origin story has been fleshed out into possibly the best Superman movie yet (guess what, no kryptonite!). It helps that it has made Superman relatable again, even more so to our generation with the complex, grappling issues that he must take on along with the badguys.

However, it can't be a perfect Superman movie. Our modern incarnation has a fair share of weaknesses that has even divided moviegoers. Some of the cinematography tends to conflict with the sense of clarity it strives towards, primarily in the opening scenes and the climactic battles. It comes off as too serious and grimy at times, though it has a nice sense of humor here and there. The action scenes do tend to get overlong, excessive, and tiring at times, but they are better handled than in some of Michael Bay's films. It is very difficult to still manage the story of Superman in a post-9/11 world, but the filmmakers have made an admirable effort in spite of its limitations and stretching in credibility.

""Man of Steel"" is by far the Superman film that we have been waiting for and that we need. It is amazing enough to wash away the bitter disappointment that is ""Superman Returns"", and so far it manages to be my favorite film of the summer and the year."

"Jun 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This movie was awful. It is almost non-stop CGI destruction, bad acting and characters that do not engage or interest me in the slightest. I kept waiting for it to get good. And then the credits rolled. Save your money."
"Jun 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Worthy attempt, playing up the alien angle. Brought low by terrible pacing (way too many flashbacks) and an ill-conceived and wholly unnecessary attempt at adding a tragic backstory."
"Jun 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,snuck in to see this
"Jun 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,Not as good as I thought
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,The beginning was a bit boring a lot to explain in to little time I guess and the fighting scenes a lot of people got hurt ... It was a awesome movie overall !!!
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,The movie was alright. Deff better than the last one. The problem is that there are so many superheroes movies that are better than this one. The movie took a bit long to kick in. The action scenes were nothing I have not seen before. Cavill did a decent job as superman
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,The Superman movie makes batman look like childsplay. It's the best superhero movie by far.
"Jun 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,Interesting...but not great version of the Superman mythos.
"Jun 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Buenos efectos, y escenas de acci√≥n interesante. En cuanto a gui√≥n, prefiero la historia contada en ""Superman 2"""
"Jun 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The story was good, the special effects are amazing but it was just fun, nothing really special. Loved Henry Caville & Russell Crowe, but the overly obvious Christian allegory was laughable."
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"Wow, to see some of these reviews makes me wonder what did you really anticipate? My review will be very simple.....Great action from the blurs of how quick they moved to the throwing through buildings! The background of Kal-El struggling with being an alien was superb! ""What was I supposed to do, let them die?"" Costner- ""Perhaps..."" Visually dynamic and I didn't see it in IMAX! I refuse to spend $18 x 5....

Caville-Great Superman!
ZOD was acted out greatly, not the classic Shakespearean original but with the emotion and rage of a destroyed Krypton! 
The Krypton scenes were brilliant! The only thing I wish I would've heard was ""Superman? Where is this Superman! Bring him before me, so he may KNEEL BEFORE ZOD!!""  And ""Why do you say these things, when you know I will kill you for it!"" In my Eddie Murphy Raw movie ""Great Freakin Movie!"""
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel, you can ask anyone, wasn't even a blip on my radar for this year's films. I repeatedly stated that I was not remotely excited to see it but I knew I would find myself in the theatre anyway to try to give an unbiased opinion. I was most pleasantly surprised. I don't think I've been riveted to a cinema screen this much since The Dark Knight Rises...hmmm I wonder why. 
My initial discomfort was ohhh another Superman story. Is this going to be some boring reboot for the decades old iconic comic book character? In some ways it is a story of Kal-El's origins in a form that was very well paced, down to the pregnant pauses between Cavill and Adams. Speaking of Adams thank goodness she shed her romantic comedy persona for an assertive Lois Lane. I wouldn't have been able to to handle a flimsy female lead character.
I couldn't have casted a better specimen...I mean actor for Clark. His inner turmoil, life lessons, confusion and soul searching were at the heart of this story juxtaposed with stunning visuals. My favourite scenes involved the mercurial story telling of Jor-El about Krypton's fate and the more macabre Superman sinking and drowning in a field of skulls after General Zod reveals his ultimate plan for Earth. Oh oh and the exotic Faora-Ul's fight sequences. 
I look forward to whatever Nolan and Synder have in store for the future Man of Steel."
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is the Superman movie that I've been waiting for... it's literally the perfect superhero film. Henry Cavill needs to just always play Superman, forever. The action and set pieces are stunning and I can't say enough good things about the special effects. The dynamic between Lois and Clark isn't explored a whole lot, but that's okay. This is an origin story, and it's told in a unique and interesting way. The sci-fi elements really impressed me and I was never bored for a second. There is plenty more potential with a sequel, although I sincerely doubt that will be able to top the level of destruction found here."
"Jun 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I love action, but the end was a bit long."
"Jun 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,I give this two thumbs down
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel



     The Man of Steel has just taken the crown of Superman movies. Well written, acting that is well executed, and a theatrical score that is memorable. I really was not into Superman comics or movies for that matter, but this movie did a great job  making the Man of Steel more relatable and personable. 
     The cinematography in this film is stylized and fresh. I like seeing a new take on sci-fi themes like other worlds and advanced tech. The producer (Christopher Nolan) and writers definetley were creative in their vision of Krypton. 
     The story starts with Kal-El (Superman) being born and the political upheaval surrounding Krypton's demise. David S. Goyer and Nolan do a great job in giving us a quick but detailed overview of Superman's origins, and his character is developed well throughout the movie. I really appreciate the fact that you're not left waiting too long until Clark Kent dons the red cape. We're also given a glimpse of his super powers and heroics throughout his life.
     Action is not lacking in this movie. The fight sequences are really multifaceted. We see Clarke struggling to overcome tremendous odds. Unlike Superman movies prior, he doesn't have the ability to move planets, or lift continents into outerspace. So the intrigue is much higher than in movies prior. It leaves you with that ""how is he going to get out of this one?"" feeling. 
     I was watching closely to the comparisons of Superman to Jesus. I couldn't find any really, at least none that could be considered offensive, so I'm not sure why some people made the comparison, or the outrage over it. Being a devote fundamentalist Christian myself, I didn't find anything offensive about it. I look for the political and religious overtones of movies and this one just turns out to be a great Sci-Fi flick. So take your kids to it and enjoy!"

"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is the superman that we've all been waiting for! My only complaint is that ""Kneel before Zod"" was never said, other than that it was perfect. Keep your eyes open for references to other big names from the DC Universe."
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,Deep and philosophical.. Restores faith in humanity.
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,Worth every penny for the action scenes
"Jun 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Well, the verdict is in on ""Man of Steel"" and it's not good. There were some nice moments but a large part of the film was devoted to simply trying to have the most epic fights and explosions while sacrificing plot, character development and intelligence. I'm kind of tired of Hollywood films that hurl special effects at me with the hope that I don't notice there isn't actually any substance to them. The best entertainment touches your heart, engages your mind and inspires your imagination. This didn't really do that."
"Jun 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Went to see ""Man of Steel"" but felt more like ""Dragonball Z""."
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,Better than expected. entertaining with good special edfects
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"the action is phenomenal and the cinematic production flawless, but the story it self is kind of superfluous. I guess it doesn't live up to the build up of the action which looks so promising. the character of superman is portrayed more seriously than the ones gone before though (love the outfit) and Cavill carries it just like a super hero, of course!"
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,who cares about the story and it doesn't follow the comics .... but finally a bad ass superman and even better NO KRYPTONYTE!!!
"Jun 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Although not as emotionally satisfying as I excpected, it does have an emotional grasp that's marred by a rushed, bombastic third act that will leave you thinking that you watched two movies instead of one."
"Jun 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Zack Snyder's version of Man of Steel has a lot (I mean hell lot) of destruction, visual effects, and body count. It is a movie that contain 1 hour of pure gold and 1 hour 30 minutes of mass destruction, building getting smashed, cars getting thrown, and not to mention, by destroying a space satellite. It is a nice try by Snyder, the movie has the spirit, but the prolonged third act took it away. Maybe it should've called ""Men of Destruction"". It is a good summer blockbuster movie and it is a Superman movie. In the end, who cares?"
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"After all the trailers hype etc Man of Steel came and recieved mixed reviews. some calling it a good pop corn movie. some dumb adaptation of the character. Man of Steel Directed by Zack Snyder written by David S. Goyer staring Henry Cavill Amy Adams Michael Shannon and Rusell Crowe.The movie is about the origin of Superman a boy born in planet krypton a planet in war by General Zod played by Michael Shannon. Kal El superman's father decides to launch his son to earth.Years passed and now superman is now an adult trying to figure out  who he is.General Zod finds superman who wants him to restore krypton.Superman now has to decide were to defend the earth or save his dstroyed planet.I'm gonna be honest I am the minority who thinks this movie is  amazing.Now you have to be thinking ""yeah you liked it because of the mindless action go watch your transformers"" well stranger a film is subjective everyone could have a different  opinion. PROS: IT'S A REIMAGINIG:first things this movie changes a little bit superman's story not  his origin just things that makes different than the Richard Donner's version. It's more bleak. Some elements of the comic are absent from and a fundamental moment in clark's life gets a big tweak the moment is present but the cause of it gets involved with a force of nature. How the story is told although in flashbacks. (that right now are clearly is an overused technique since Memento) are  well told and have a emotion to it even though they have some clich√É (C) s in it. Another thing the movie does good is the"
"Jun 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I definitely liked this movie. This version of superman was really badass! I also liked general zod, it was good casting."
"Jun 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"For some reason superman movies are never epic.  They are good but nothing special.   For this movie to be great they need to have the actor from smallville play Clark.  He did it for ten years, who better to do the film justice.  What made smallville so popular was the good chemistry the characters had and progressive build of our hero.  

This film totally disregards the story line with inaccuracies and pointless explosions  It had it's moments but sadly they were mainly flashbacks of our hero as a child.  The film really does nothing to build our hero into the man of steel we all know and love.  Instead it just drags it out big time"
"Jun 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,"If you've seen the Christopher Reeve Movie then you've bleedin' seen this haven't you?
I mean, what IS wrong with you?
If you haven't seen the Christopher Reeve movie then i feel sorry for you.
A bit of a fuck up.
As a very good mate of mine put it: 'Russell Crowe phoned it in'.
Jeez."
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"Superman gets another shot to save the planet as Snyder adds ""Man of Steel"" to the list.

Man of Steel is not your average Superman movie. It brings in a lot of knuckles and hits you a couple of times straight through the heart.

TRAILER
The film's trailer got mixed reviews, some claiming it ain't enough to increase the viewers' cravings. Nonetheless I think it had just enough mix to set the right expectations for the film. From the looks of it, the trailer tells us that this film will not feature the Superman we are used to. There will be changes, big changes as to the storyline and other stuff.

CAST
Cavill is the right man for the title. No questions on his built, he was clearly ready to portray a steel-like physique. He exceeded expectations with superb acting and that Superman-stare. I wasn't sure at first if Amy Adams can do it, but she did a pretty decent job to play a stronger and fiercer Lois Lane. Michael Shannon may have some overdone tricks but it worked just right for most parts.

EFFECTS
Man of Steel was a roller-coaster ride. CGI played excellently, with every fight scene keeping us from breathing. Though some tracks may be similar to what we heard before from The Dark Knight or Inception, those booming instruments surely helped keep the thrill up.

It won't be surprising if this film will get mixed reviews, but Man of Steel may just be the right stuff to kick off the Justice League. It had the action and the perfect heart pinch to make it one of this year's best Superhero films."
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"This was an incredible movie that was very aesthetically appealing and got enough background and detail that'll keep audience guessing of what's next for Superman, now that he's finally revealed himself not as something against us, but a symbol for something representing us."
"Jun 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Even if it gets ridiculous towards the end, it is still one of the best movies about Supes that we'll get in this day and age."
"Jun 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,If you turn off the sound and just watch the visuals it looks like it could be a truly great film. But the truth is it's Transformers-quality trash with a classy box.
"Jun 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Two words. Train wreck. This makes the second consecutive installment in the franchise that is hard to watch, drawn out way too long, does nothing to add to a story we already know, and fails to make old characters new. 

My favorite part of the film come at the 2 hour mark when Zod proclaims, ""This only ends one way. Either you kill me or I kill you!"" It was my favorite part because it made me believe it would eventually end. Up to that point it seemed like I was watching and endless loop of ships and debris smashing into a city. 

Another moment I was able to relate to (spoiler alert) came when Supe kills Zod and out of frustration, screams. I was doing that one hour into this feature. One and done. I'd never waste a minute watching this craptacular again."
"Jun 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,Man of Steel gets a LOT of things right - this is the most compelling that Superman has ever been on the big screen - but it's bogged down by some sections that ramble or need to be shortened.
"Jun 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,Too much action. Annoying
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"The movie is an okay summer blockbuster, but it`s sadly not up there with: The Dark Knight and Jurassic Park."
"Jun 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I fell asleep in the theater, that's about all I have to say."
"Jun 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It was alright. Not bad at all. Lots of action to take in and same old story with some tweaks to it. I wish they could've added some stuff from the previous Superman movies. I.e, KNEEL BEFORE ZOD! And the old theme song would've been nice to add there too in fact I was bummed that they didn't put it there but I understand that it is a remake."
"Jun 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,Vaaaya chasco me he llevado con esta peli. Est√° mejor el trailer que la pel√≠cula :S
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"WOW!  First off, I have to say that this was an excellent film. The actors were phenomenal, the direction was on point and the action was superb. The back story of Clark is done very well.  And the graphics... wow. Outstanding! The whole movie was awesome. 
Henry Cavill's performance is Perfect... He was born to play this iconic role. No other actor has ever looked the part like him. Best Superman movie I've seen."
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"This was a good movie for a reboot, but had some minor misses."
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,Epic action! Epic CGI and interesting twist in the superman story we have become comfortable watching. Definately a successful reboot and a well spaced story of how Kal El came to Earth. Shows his human side what he had to overcome to become the man and hero the planet needs. LOVE IT!!!!!
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"Let's be real here...if you are a fan of.
 superman...your gonna like it, if your not you won't. The actor they picked was spot on! different story than were used too but all in all its worth watching."
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"it got that christopher nolan's feel into it, but this ride was much better than batman begins"
"Jun 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Some will say Superman has not had the best films, and i would have to agree. I was hoping that this would boost it's stanima in the cinematic world, it would obviously bring in enough green, but i want a Superman movie that is actually good. 


It's funny, most people don't know that Cal (Superman) is really a alien, and they really put that out front in this film. Considering the first 30 minutes is on Krypton, it really becomes apparent who Superman really is. I think that is why this movie worked for me, by that factor it really brought out the obsticals that Cal would face on earth. The first 30 minutes set the tone for me, emotion, story, plot were pouring out and i was getting everything that i wanted. It had a strong emotional pull around Cals home life, dealing with his powers, and his qwest to find out who he really is. The connection was their, Krypton was set as a metaphor for fallen hope, and it had me almost in tears. The first 30 minutes or say first half were outstanding.

Don't get me wrong i still liked the film past its 30 minutes. It still had its moments, but thats the problem. At times it just losses all drive, then for a couple scenes that emotional pull is apparent again, then it gets lost in very long and repetitive action sequence. I did think the action was very impressive and some very powerfull and thoughtfull angles were apparent. Which i loved, but a very impressive action scene can get to long and repetitive, and when  it makes the film lose emotion and turn it muddy with no directon, you really want it to stop.

I loved this film.......... At times. The drive is their........... At times. The charectors had development......... At times. I think we have a film that REALLY works and is SUPER good.......At times. Ovrall the emotion that was their held it up, which i why i enjoyed MAN OF STEEL."
"Jun 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Scenes good, performances good, story idea good.....execution awful.  Shame."
"Jun 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Awful and boring , i was expecting more."
"Jun 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The first half is fantastic! Everything's really well set up, before it lags into a dreary same-old last half-hour."
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"The action keeps you involved, following the characters without the lost feeling found in the Avengers. Surprisingly, it also asks probing moral questions about population controlls like abortion, genetic mannipulation, and contraception while being light footed enough to keep from being preachy. Overall a very enjoyable, albeit serious, film."
"Jun 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The outcome of Superman's first challenge leaves one wondering why in the world we would be grateful for his presence going forward. With the nonsensical plot, unnatural dialogue, and poor grasp on human nature, this movie only works as a satire on Hollywood blockbusters."
"Jun 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Kind of a downer. I expected more I think. I might be spoiled by the recent Batman movies... But something in this movie is lacking. IMO Superman 2 with General Zod is better. This might be a platform movie for better things to come, but as it sits by itself... Wait for DVD folks....and yes I'm a Superman fan. A ton of potential that didn't deliver."
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,It was a good start to the beginning of Superman hope they do more
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great actors in the movie and Henry Cavill is a wonderful Superman with his combination of looks, physique and great acting.  The storyline and how it is told could use some help though.  However, I do like the fact that they give credit to Lois Lane's intelligence by not making Lois ""now know"" Clark Kent is Superman.  If he looks like Superman, has physique like Superman, disappears everytime there is a calamity..then d-u-h...he must be Superman, That always bothered me in the past Superman movies.  All in all, Man of Steel is still a very entertaining movie and I would love to see Henry Cavill back in a Superman sequel movie."
"Jun 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I expected more out of our Last Son of Krypton. Good casting?frankly, Henry Cavill was a spot on Superman?but the plot was lackluster and splotchy and even though General Zod nearly leveled our beloved Metropolis, he and Superman still battle it out in a completely fixed, renovated, and populated Metropolis. We who loves superheroes deserve much more out of our Man of Steel."
"Jun 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"Try not to let your selves be clouded with what you think you know about Superman and accept this as movie for what it is... like we did with The Dark Knight' - the only downer is that its too American i.e.... 'threat to America?'  ....erm what about the rest of the world? ...any way, listen to 'AMC movie reviews' via YouTube - Really Enjoyed it - hope you do too :)"
"Jun 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This was not what I hoped it would be. As far as action films go, I guess it was fine.  But Superman deserves more. So too do the fans.  Without writing War and Peace, what I'll say is this:  I think the film was trying to do too much. It wanted to show Superman's development and keep the superhero-saves-the-day element. it could have done both.  But superman's enemy shouldn't have been Kryptonians but the people of Earth. The film hinted at this as an issue and they could have had an amazing film from that.  As the ending hints at a sequel, I know fans could have coped with seeing less sci-fi/action if they had witnessed true character development which Smallville the tv series did perfectly because they devoted time to it.  As a Smallville fan, this is where I feel let do.wn.  The action was also good but it didn't sit right to me because of what I believed I should have been seeing instead.  In short, the film set out to do everything but managed little. cFor fans of both Smallville and the original Christopher Reeve films, you're likely to be disappointed. On a positive note, Henry Cavill is perfectly cast and deserved a better script."
"Jun 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,"It a boring movies, i expected a lot from this movie it was disappointing"
"Jun 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I had high hopes for this movie, but it was way too long and it has none of the charm of the original superman movies.  I do like the new superman actor, though."
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,Epic film. New Supes for modern times.
"Jun 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,It was just too much.
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome. Henry Cavill plays Superman so well. Love Zod. But every scene is very veey loud. worth seeing in theates
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"Different than im used to seeing but refreshing in that this is the way Superman should be. I like that there is more hand to hand combat and that there wasnt a lot of slow spots like the last one had, it was pretty much action packed all the way through."
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome!!!! And I grew up with the old comic books and Christopher Reeve. Awesome. Edge of my seat most of the time.
"Jun 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Not a bad movie, but, I do think an icon like superman deserves a better effort."
"Jun 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,Thought it could have been better but I liked the Scifi direction that this one took. A ton of action!
"Jun 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,Absolutely horrible movie. Very poorly written and some CGI is just awful. Avoid at all costs.
"Jun 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,It was a good film. But not the best this summer. Star trek was way better.
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed it. It definitely had issues, but I was very intrigued by the story, its characters, and its potential for flowing into a bigger DC universe. Also , Henry Cavill is rather nice to look at. Amy Adams, Diane Lee, Russell Crowe, Michael Shannon, Antje Traue, and even Kevin Costner all did a wonderful job."
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"It hit all the things I needed from an action movie. There were some scenes that didn't match up, but overall it was enjoyable."
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,Great Movie I loved this new version Henry Cavill is awesome in this movie!!!
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,really good. I was left wanting more though and felt rushed through some of it. die hard superman comic fans may not like it so much.
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"A complete cross-promotional fail! Kal-El doesn't shave w/a Gillette Fusion Proglide, or eat a single bacon cheeseburger from Hardee's! ""A good death is it's own reward."" (4 stars out of 5)"
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great Visuals, a nice new take on the Superman series."
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,NOT another Superman movie. Go see it!!
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"Loved this adaption of the story! Despite what I heard going in, not one particular segment seemed too long. Enjoy this story and let the discussion on Part 2 begin!"
"Jun 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This movie felt like watching a sequel, only there wasn't a first movie. Too little character development so I didn't connect/feel for the characters. In the end, I just wanted the fights scenes, and the movie, to be over."
"Jun 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,I can't express how much I hated this movie.
"Jun 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,About the only thing I liked about this is when it was on Krypton. Beautiful planet building. Not a film I would see again.
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"Snyder and company take an interesting direction with the first installment in this generation's Superman franchise. Spending more time exploring Krypton's society and eventual demise, meant less time showing how Clark Kent becomes the iconic figure we all know and I love. But I for one enjoyed the cool sci-fi backstory and personally did not need to see Superman's rise to adulthood told for the tenth time. Overall, cool movie, but maybe a little darker than I was expecting. Also disappointed that they didn't set up Lex Luthor as the villain in the next film. Where was the obligatory post-credits scene?"
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,Good movie but too much CGI... Superman movies will never be as good as the Batman trilogy...
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,Once again this movie was awesome I saw it twice ROTTEN TOMATOES IS ACTUALLY ROTTEN AT CRITIQUING MOVIES! A 56% worse than Ironman 3 are you kidding me???
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"What can you say...It is ""Superman"""
"Jun 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,I was really looking forward to this for a couple of reasons One I LOVED SMR I thought it was great and I don't care what ANYONE says. and two after the successful Batman Reboot by Warner/DC I was hopping this would be in the same caliber and it.. is..A little. the action and the special effects are great and all but saddly the story is..rushed (or at least that's how I felt) it seemed that with in minutes the story was advancing to points that would..well...be...only capable if you where superman(no pun intended) meaning it would feel like the film LEAPED 5 years forward in a matter of Mins but nothing really changed so it was a little disappointing in that aspect. That aside it was still entertaining but..not NEARLY as good as the three Nolan ones that previously started this trend for DC and also(IMO) not as entertaining as Superman Returns which was the reason this film was made. Maybe I'm slightly byis too because I was never really a superman fan and also I was a HUGE fan of Singers Superman Returns but at the same time after the previous batman films I really had high hopes for this especially since the story was written by both Goyer AND Nolan so It had to be at least interesting . Unfortunately it wasn't. Like it was fun and entertaining but in the end the films..climax's and etc all felt generic and could be used in ANY superhero movie and etc. I really hope the sequel improves on the decent groundwork this film has set up(it's REALLY got it set up great for a sequel to redeem this film and make this series great) AND also it would be nice to see DC get another great franchise going after the success of Batman
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"Good plot and casting, some of the fight scenes were unnecessarily dragged out, you'd think they would realise that throwing eachother into buildings doesn't do shit sooner!"
"Jun 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I was bred for this! I was trained all my life to be a warrior! Where did you train, A FARM?

The story of an alien baby sent from a dying planet to a planet of desperate need receives a relaunch.  We watch Clark Kent transition from Smalleville to Metropolis.  Shortly after arriving in the big city, an alien leader from Clark's home planet, Krypton, arrives with threats of world domination if Clark doesn't turn himself over.  Will Clark give up or fight the alien to the death?    

""The world's too big, mom.""
""Then make it small.""

Zack Snyder, director of 300, Dawn of the Dead, Watchmen, Sucker Punch, and Legends of the Guardians, delivers Man of Steel.  The storyline for this picture had a lot of potential as General Zod made a great villain and the cast was very well selected.  The cast includes Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, and Laurence Fishburne.

""You will give the people an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, and they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun. In time, you will help them accomplish wonders.""

This was likely the movie I was most excited about this summer.  I felt this film had potential based on Christopher Nolan's writing and Snyder's direction; unfortunately, this film fell a little flat for me.   The action was awesome, but the story and characters were not as compelling as the Dark Knight characters.  Overall, this movie is worth seeing once, but was not as good as the Dark Knight pictures by a long shot.

""A good death is its own reward.""

Grade: C+/B-"
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,Skips the boring love story to make a beautiful coming of age story
"Jun 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I expected some heart and an overall character arc on why Superman feels the need to protect the people of earth. I got none of that. I got a jumbled narrative and lackluster visuals. Despite a couple cool actions scenes it's a step backward for ole Supes. A big bag of Meh. Oh, and the 3-D is non existent. Don't bother."
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"Best Super film to date, easily! at least as good as Iron Man"
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"Finally a Superman that people can be proud of. It brought back what everyone wanted! His powers at peek, and the emotional roller coaster that is also delivered will leave you wiping your tears. Prepare for a new era of The Man of Steel!"
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,great movie.. lots of action
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"Most people would look at the Superman story and say, ""We're going to tell this story in a linear fashion."" This team did not, and they did it very well. It wasn't perfect, but I was entertained throughout."
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"My favourite superhero movie of all time. I thought they picked the perfect cast. Very enjoyable. Amazing special effects. Not corny, like the previous movies. Can't wait for the next one."
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is a really thoughtful start to what will be a major series of films. We begin with Supermans humble beginning, told in flashback which presents a tortured soul looking to find his place on our planet.
Henry Cavill is excellent as Clark/Superman and certainly fills Supes suit admirably well. But his acting was thoughtful and with distinct quality. A fine actor with large shoes to fill. There are DEFINATELY moments where you see Christopher Reeves thoughtful performance in Cavills acting although this probably just coincidence I found it warming and reassuring as I'm a huge Reeve fan.

Excellent action set pieces with some great super moves.

All in all, I really enjoyed it and watched on a large 42"" LCD with a big surround system it doesn't disappoint.

Very good. One criticism is the fact that Lois knows all about him early on and I would have preferred her to remain unknowing of his true identity but I suppose it's just moving things on. 

Great film none the less, well worth watching."
"Jun 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Visually stunning but an underwhelming Superman movie. The main issue was the very poor script.
The movie was filled with a lot of weak characters, little humour and a storyline that seemed at times flawed. Also the pacing was strange and the lack of real world danger didn't come across on screen at all.

However Henry Cvail (Superman), Amy Adams (Lois) and Russell Crowe performances were decent and save the movie from being a complete disaster 

I'd recommend you wait for this movie on DVD. - An average/decent movie."
"Jun 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"For my first superman movie this defiantly helped me understand the story of superman and where he came from. This movie had excellent cinematography in my opinion, lots of quick zooms for an example which gave it a live look, making you feel there. However towards the end I got rest less with lots of repeated fighting scenes.. So it seemed a bit long. So if you don't like long action fighting scenes that are repetitive then I say pass, but if you like or don't mind them, I say it's a see."
"Jun 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,Eh! Too much destruction.. Cheesy lines.
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,Man of Steel is literally the best Superhero movie of the 21st Century...Screw the critics...the greatest comic book legend just got re-invented...
"Jun 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Man of Steel is way better than the shameful ""Superman Returns"" (2006): restless action (maybe a little bit too much?) and excellent actors. Russell Crowe is marvelous as usual, Michael Shannon is a terrifying Zod,  Amy Adams is the best Lois Lane I saw (smart without being irritating), and last but not least Henry Cavill is definitely a good choice as he truly embodies the Man of Steel.
This movie being produced by C. Nolan, I would say that here Clark Kent is not as charismatic as Bruce Wayne (maybe due to the very nature of Clark who is supposed to be a kind of ""Mister Nice Guy""). Anyway, I enjoyed watching this movie and I think that Z. Snyder/C. Nolan did again a very good job.
It goes without saying that the Man of Steel soundtrack is breath-taking, how can it be different since it was composed by Hans Zimmer???!!!"
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"Cuando vi hace poco la primera pel√≠cula de Superman interpretada por Christopher Reeve, me surgieron muchas dudas: ¬øpor qu√© Jor-El lleva una S de Superman en su traje si se supone que en su planeta es uno m√°s? ¬øC√≥mo era la vida en el planeta Kripton? ¬øDe qu√© muri√≥ el padre de Clark Kent? ¬øQui√©n le dise√±o ese traje-pijama? ¬øPudiendo elegir entre otros oficios porqu√© eligi√≥ ser periodista? A ninguna de estas preguntas consigui√≥ responder las versiones siguientes, ha hecho falta una versi√≥n completamente nueva, original, renovada e incluso me atrever√≠a a decir diferente, para aclararme todas esas dudas.
La primera innovaci√≥n que se destaca es el tema principal de la BSO completamente original, yo y muchos como yo supongo, siempre nos imaginaremos aparecer a nuestro h√©roe con el tema que compuso John Williams, la segunda innovaci√≥n que se agradece es que en ning√∫n momento de todo el metraje se esconde detr√°s de unas gafas, siempre se nos muestra a cara descubierta, la tercera innovaci√≥n los padres cobran m√°s protagonismo en esta cinta que en ninguna anterior, la cuarta innovaci√≥n nos ahorran el romanticismo empalagoso de la relaci√≥n entre Superman y Louis Lane y por √∫ltimo otro detalle importante, los medios de la prensa no quieren saber nada de √©l.
Como ya he dicho en otras ocasiones, este superh√©roe tiene su inspiraci√≥n en el nuevo testamento, aqu√≠ se nota bastante en el momento en que decide sacrificar su vida para as√≠ salvar al resto de la humanidad, sin olvidarnos de ese padre omnipresente que es Jor-El y su otro padre en la tierra un humilde granjero.
En lo que respecta a la pirotecnia, pues s√≠, puede que al director se le haya ido la mano en cuanto edificios, monumentos y veh√≠culos destruidos, pero quiz√°s sea la √∫nica manera de no aburrir al espectador despu√©s de la hora y media de largometraje, de despertar al t√≠pico que acostumbra a dormirse en las salas de cine. Los efectos visuales y digitales como no pod√≠a ser menos en estas superproducciones y en estos tiempos, espectaculares.
Y lo mejor de todo, es que por fin Superman tiene un rival a su altura.
As√≠ que: Yo no te suelo rezar mucho pero si est√°s ah√≠ y lees esto Superman s√°lvame."
"Jun 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,"horrible movie, made no sense"
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,This film has bought Superman into the 21st century.
"Jun 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"After leaving the cinema, I was left with a puzzling thought of whether or not I enjoyed the new Superman flick. So yeah, it finally showcases the 'Man of Steel' in his best light for years but has the emotional depth been lost in translation? The new concept of providing the audience with enough fight scenes, explosions and cascading skyscrapers than they can handle struggles to allow for a fitting story for Louis and Clark. Worth going to see - but see it in the cinema and you won't rush to buy it on DVD."
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,Critics are useless..
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"A loooot better than expected, actually I'm willing to see the next movie of the serie without a doubt. A lot of action, no waste of time telling the whole story of the man of Steel childhood, instead he remembers part of it to show the most important parts to follow the story."
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,Loved it!!!! You know a movie is great when you look at your watch and hope there is a ton of time left in the movie. Could watch Henry Cavill all day. Want to see it again!
"Jun 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,Best superman movie yet!
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"NO CONOCIA LO QUE ERA UN BLOCKBUSTER HASTA VER
23 de Junio de 2013 0 de 0 usuarios han encontrado esta cr√≠tica √∫til.
LO MEJOR: Es sin ninguna duda la pel√≠cula de superman por excelencia ( la que los amantes de superman quer√≠amos ver ), y la pel√≠cula mas grande a nivel de acci√≥n que he visto en una sala de cine. A Zack Snyder lo eligieron por algo, y ese algo se ve reflejado durante todo el metraje ( el que busque otro tipo de pel√≠cula que no sea acci√≥n/aventura , se esta equivocando de film ), Las secuencias de acci√≥n son IMPRESIONANTES y el CGI es ""awesome"" . Henry Cavill es el mejor superman, le da alma, lo humaniza ( esta excelente ). Michael Shannon cumple perfectamente encarnando al genera ZOD.
LO PEOR: El inicio del film, el metraje de ""Krypton"" esta un poco desorientado ( da la impresi√≥n de ser otra pel√≠cula totalmente distinta; quiz√°s sea por el hecho de ser algo que no se hab√≠a visto antes en una pel√≠cula de superman ). La debilidad ( por as√≠ decirlo ) de los kryptonianos esta muy rebuscada ( personalmente..no me convence ). El montaje, exactamente de los ""flashbacks"" termina resultando muy lioso ( aveces no sabes en que a√±o o lugar estas ).
PD: Superman es un supe-heroe con poderes incre√≠bles, por tanto, esos poderes se tiene que ver a lo grande y Zack Snyder lo sabe muy bien y eso es lo que ofrece (el que quiera ver un superman √±o√±o, que vea ""Superman Retunrs"".
PPD: En definitiva, Man Of Steel es el blockbuster mas grande que he visto hasta ahora, y eso lo agradezco.. y mucho!."
"Jun 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,Man of Steel was a letdown for me after watching Smallville for 10 Seasons. Henry Cavill was very good as Superman and the special effects were good but  the general story was weak.
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,best superman iv seen
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome!  Not the kiddie Superman story; it's a grown up version with unbelievable animation.
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,Epic...plain and simply....Epic. Man of Steel...was good. Different from the past Superman movies. Henry Cavill...was a great Superman & Clark/Kal-El.
"Jun 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,"No one in the story uses any logic, which leads me to believe that this wasn't written by people but by a computer. Below are some things that don't make any damn sense. SPOILERS!

Ok, so Kripton is exploding. Why are they saving Zod and e other criminals instead of evacuating? Maybe the hat wearing council are douches, but Jor and Lana seem sensible at least half the time, so why are they abandoning their baby in a pod and letting all of their people die? And don't tell me because of the movie's reason of they've products of the broken system and what not. That's just dumb.
Jonathan Kent raises Clark to think that hiding his powers is more important than helping people? Uh, no. The whole point is that Superman is an old fashioned good guy who has morals and believes in good old ideal cliches. He's not jaded. He's basically Captain America, but with less war.
Pa Kent dies in a tornado? I just...I don't even have the words. He was trying to save Toto from the car and then got tornadoed to death. That's the dumbest thing ever.
Why does Zod want to terraform Earth? Presumably they can terraform any planet, so what's wrong with Mars? Clark would've gone with him willingly. And don't say because he's evil. Zod's whole coup and fight with Jor didn't make sense. I would've thought that overthrowing the Alien Hat Council would be a good thing that Jor would totally support, given the fact that they were douches who let their planet explode.
No one aside from Louis Lane and sometimes Jor had much of a personality.
The Jesus imagery. Kal is in a church (I guess he's Christian?) and there is a huge Jesus stained glass image behind him. TOO SUBTLE! Oh, and all the times he spread his hands like he's on a damn cross.
Kal was like: my Earth dad says I have to hide my powers, even though that means he'll get tornadoed in the face...doh, ok. But wait, now my space dad tells me to go be Jesus and get a job and stop eating Cheetos and gives me a hot man suit...doh, ok. Seriously, Kal had no personal interest in his future, nor did he make any interesting choices. He even became a reporter because it was convenient.
I'm sure other things were wrong with the film, but I can't think of them right now.
I guess it looked pretty. Too much lens-flare though."
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,The Sci-fi in this is top notch. It's also perfectly cast. It's not a flawless film but you couldn't ask for anything more in a Superman film.
"Jun 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It was alright, didn't love it."
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"Phenomenal!

I would gladly pay the $12.50 again to see it a second time!"
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"Very well done, I was worried I would be let down but I was surprised. I was glad they did not create a copy of the superman movies that came before, but went down their own road. I would see it again."
"Jun 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,A turd that looks like chocolate.
"Jun 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,"It's ok, much more better than Superman returns,  but had rubbish ending."
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"As with any movie, there are things we can pick apart and personally deem 'unfit' to be worthy of our expectations.  The Man of Steel is no exception.  With that said, and being an avid Superman buff since childhood, I was awed by the modern day recreation of my hero.  Greatly disappointed in the last 'Superman Returns' movie, I was hoping for more this time around, and I got it good!!  This one actually took the time to tell us Superman's Krypton beginnings and just why he was here.  The special effects were over the top, and I give the producers two thumbs up for picking Henry Cavill for the role.  His appearance is what I expected to see as Superman, and strikingly similar to Smallville's Tom Welling.  Fantastic fight scenes, CGI and character portrayal makes this Superman worth every cent.  The Lois Lane angle was a little weak, but I can be forgiving as far as she is concerned.  In my opinion, super hero's do not always need a romantic interest."
"Jun 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,It was okay. Not up there with the other summer blockbusters but I think all theater worthy.
"Jun 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,Not at all bad - but not great! Watched Superman II yesterday and this doesn't match it. Costner's Jonathan Kent really got on my tits - even more sanctimonious than Martin Sheen's Uncle Ben ... and that takes some doing. If my son had super powers I wouldn't expect him to accept bullying - I'd expect him to pulp all on-comers ... and if I was in a tornado I'd want him to save me ... not be blown away like Kevin Costner's career. That being said Cavill wasn't bad & Michael Shannon gave good Zod (tho not up with Terence Stamp). Oh ... and don't get me started on Lois Lane!!!
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,absolutely awesome. glad they finally made a good superman flick.
"Jun 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Should have called this ""Superman Destroys Smallville and Metropolis"" instead."
"Jun 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Good start, but it's not the Dark Knight and it lacks real anticipation.  The answer to conflicts come way to quickly and way too easy.  Very Michael Bayish..........that's a bad thing."
"Jun 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,"A typical Hollywood block-buster action-packed effort stuffed full of millions of dollars of high end, state-of-the-art special effects - and franky the poorer for it.  Because although this flick leaves one's senses reeling from a stunning full-frontal assault the heart in this 'epic' is sadly lacking.  When one compares this to the original Chris Reeve/ Marlon Brando movie I find myself harking back to the fun, charm and 'heart' of the 1978 Richard Donner classic.  And to be perfectly honest there were times during the movie that I just wanted The Man of Steel to 'knock-out' the baddy and get on with the actual story rather than engaging in a seemingly endless onslaught of frantic crashing and head-bashing causing more damage to the city and its bewildered citizens than 'General Zod' and his dark cold lieutenants ever could! A great 'effect effort' but a dry, dessicated story with little spark and definitely no glow."
"Jun 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,"It was a horrible, horrible movie.  It was very boring, how many times can he punch or get punched through a building."
"Jun 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Awesome story, I would give this movie 5 stars, but it's ruined by too much unneeded, pointless action."
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"so much better than that bore-fest, ""superman returns"" . this movie feels like a combination of the 90's cartoon (action) and the tone of the dark knight trilogy. can't wait to see it again."
"Jun 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It would have been a great movie if I wasn't a diehard superman fan. If you're not, go see it. If you are a diehard Superman fan, wait for the next remake"
"Jun 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Wait until it's on TV, with all its effects original was better :(("
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,This is the long a waited reboot that Superman needs. So damn glad that WB went this route.
"Jun 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,"""Man of Steel"" was generic, boring, and completely unfocused.  The characters had no chemistry between each other whatsoever.  This movie presented viewers with an overdose of CGI effects in exchange for decent screenwriting, elegant scripting, and well-rounded character development in the end.  I know that it's only a fantasy movie, not a biographical story, but honestly - ""Man of Steel"" could have been so much better than this!"
"Jun 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Look alive people, we've got a class-A mainstream comic book movie to load! First things first: did Snyder ""ruin"" Superman and is the movie a flop? The movie's a perfectly fine action blockbuster. Having said that, let's poke at all of the moving parts and inspect what works and what does not. There will be SPOILERS, but you'll survive.

Casting: Spot on! Cavill is a chiseled man of steel, and knows how to emote shyness, frustration, joy, anger, and friendship at every turn. When not zooming about as a CGI blur, he's a great leading man and Kryptonian. Crowe and Shannon play rival Kryptonians surprisingly well, and the movie works best on Krypton itself (am I wrong to wish for a prequel?). This movie strongly risked exhausting audiences with yet another superhero origin story, but between Crowe beating ""Avatar"" at its own game and Shannon's slow tumble into madness, this movie almost doesn't need Superman in it at all. 

Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are the wise, salt-of-the-earth parents in the land of trucks, Jesus, and American flags, and together they form the perfect Sears commercial - I mean, IHOP - I mean, 7-Eleven - I mean, be all you can be in the armed forces. Regardless, the Kent farm is a land almost as alien as Krypton for its sheer isolation and earnestness, and every flashback to Clark's upbringing was like a welcome slice of Malick's ""Tree of Life"" (as opposed to an unwelcome slice, which would feature Sean Penn).

Lois Lane. Talk about a loaded character. Can Margot Kidder be outclassed? No, of course not. But Adams plays Lane as a resourceful, brave journalist, and she fit the movie like a glove. I read complaints that she teleports throughout the movie as the plot demands, but the plot also gives her fair motivations and amounts of time to get from place to place, so that complaint is null. What does it say about DC Comics/Entertainment that I'm proud of this movie for its LACK of cleavage? Adams dresses like a professional at the Daily Planet, wears weather-appropriate clothing in the arctic, and even a flight suit that isn't zipped down to her bellybutton. And by the end of the movie, she's bonded with Superman, but isn't declaring her love or anything, but is still finding her comfort zone. Hand holding, a post-crisis kiss, talking shop with the guy's ghost-hologram dad (but not mom, these spaceships only have enough RAM for one consciousness at a time!), these are the cornerstones of budding love. I would have liked her to have more lines to flex her intellect and wit, but the sequel-baiting ending hints that there will be much more Daily Planet to come than what we got here.

Now let's talk about two really dumb moments in the movie, why they actually work, and then why they're dumb anyway!

The Kent family is on the road when a tornado strikes. Everyone races to an overpass to huddle together, but the Kents left their dog behind (what?!). Jonathan Kent runs back for the dog and reminds Clark that he is to never reveal his powers to others or else the world will go nuts over his existence. He gets stuck trying to rescue the dog and is killed by the tornado. In context, this scene makes its own kind of sense, as there is a crowd of people watching the tornado approach and Kent's death helps justify and motivate Clark's extreme shyness (not brooding, by the way) as an adult. On the other hand, this is still a dumb way to kill Jonathan, and a Superman who's an icon of hope would be more likely to save his dad in a way that satisfies the will to save others and the need for privacy. I dunno, maybe he holds onto Kent's car from below and doesn't tell his dad he saved him. Show me Superman unable to prevent his adopted father's death by heart attack, either in the form of him hearing his dad's heartbeat go weak or Kent telling him during the attack that it's his time. In any case, killing off Kent by putting a promise leash on Clark is stupid and a wasted opportunity to show us how Clark finds hope in hopeless situations. 

The second moment, and the one that really burst an iconic bubble for many fans, was when Superman killed Zod. Zod forced Superman's hand by pointing his heat vision at some people, Superman shouted at him to stop, Zod shouted back ""Never,"" and so Superman broke his neck with sonic boom force before letting out a Vader-esque ""NOOOOO!"" at his violated moral code. Again, within the movie, this kind of makes sense, as Superman isn't completely in tune with his Kryptonian upbringing, and is told by his birth dad that he was intended as a bridge between humans and Kryptonians. This leads to the pain of embracing, if only for an instant, the ruthless murder ""passed on"" to him by Zod, as well as murdering the only remaining member of his species. However, immediately after this moment passes, the movie reverses all momentum in order to get its final scenes in before the credits roll. Snyder, having logged in that an emotional moment happened, wants to keep the story rolling when it should linger, which it would be better at if it hadn't been bouncing all over the place for the past hour. This was not a murder built up over the course of the movie (just a throwaway line), but a ""wasn't that so badass?"" chest-bump. The only worthy payoff for Superman reluctantly murdering someone is if the sequel(s) make a big deal out of it, and even then that's a huge gamble. Remember when Harvey Dent was used as the lynchpin of The Dark Knight Rises? Snake eyes!

But even with all these picked nits, the real elephant in the room is the heavy use of CGI. It's employed brilliantly for the sorts of things that are such spectacles that they need it, such as the whole battle on Krypton and its destruction. But when superpowered people collide, they become action figures bouncing against each other. The Hulk stole ""The Avengers"" by reducing the main villain to a ragdoll, but it happened near the very end because all tension has been released and is only returned by introducing another threat. If everyone's a bouncy blur midway through ""Man of Steel,"" what do they become later? Oh, they keep crashing into stuff until they stop crashing to end the movie, okay. At the very least, I like that Superman is new enough to fighting that he contributes to massive collateral damage. Hey fanboys, you wanted a recreation of the Superman/Shazam fight, well ya got it! 

There are signs of humor in the movie that really needed to flourish. These are superheroes on Earth, let's see some levity! Like that sign that says ""___ Days Since The Last Work Accident"" that gets demolished. We're still on Day Zero, Snyder, but I like where you're headed. Do you plan on continuing to endorse Wayne Enterprises and Lexcorp?"
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,If my wife left me for Henry Cavill I would be very understanding.
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"Very powerful movie, will have you moving in your seat!"
"Jun 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Massively disappointing. Never takes off as a superhero movie should. Never thrilling.....never exciting. Utterly joyless. Best scenes in the film belong to Crowe and Costner. That's a big problem when they don't involve your main character. Terribly irresponsible filmmaking at the end. Overall, a big misfire from start to finish."
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,this was a great movie!!!!!!!!!.
"Jun 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,"As I desperately search for a way to rate this film with less than a half star, I'd be remised to not elaborate on what a truly disgusting, borderline offensive piece of cinema ""Man of Steel"" is. The plot is arbitrary and nonsensical and even fails to address key components of the familiar SuperMan story, like umm KRYPTONITE! The script is laughably bad and the acting from the lead characters is abysmal as it projects ""Second Hand Embarrassment"" onto the viewing audience. Moreover the actions sequences, the moments that should be this movies saving grace, are simply overdone, to the point where they became nauseating to watch. Therefore, similar to the flasher across the street, perhaps if we all ignore Christopher Nolan, he'll go away. Finally Zack Snyder, you should be sickened with yourself. Consider yourself lucky that people were still willing to see your film, however as a man who claims to dedicate his life to cinematography you should be ashamed."
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"An all around entertaining and enjoyable film, the best movie I've seen so far this year1"
"Jun 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"did not enjoy the way it was cut or told. also a lot more violent than expected, would not show to kids under 13."
"Jun 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Better tha Superman Returns, not even close to Superman 1 & 2."
"Jun 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,More like meh of steel
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"This the reboot we've been waiting for. Fresh and full of guts. With proper superhuman battles, with all the collateral damage you could possibly hope for."
"Jun 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"There's a few too many preposterous action sequences and it could do with being a bit shorter, but there's a decent movie in there somewhere. I just wish a film about a man who flies around in a big red cape could have had a more of a sense of fun about it.

One of the better Superman movies, but that's not a hugely difficult achievement!"
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,Nolan clearly needs to supervise anyone who wants to direct a GOOD modern superhero movie.
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"It's a lot darker than any other Superman, but it's still pretty entertaining and has a brilliant cast. If there is anything wrong with it, it's just the fact that the ending completely forgets about all the destruction that happened less than a month (movie time) prior."
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"THIS IS IT!!!! This is the Superman I've waited for years to see! Henry
 Cavill is what I expected as a child from the Christopher Reeve Superman. Great Special FX and accurate Superman story with new minor changes. I love it! Want to see it again!"
"Jun 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,I laughed out loud through most of the movie.  I am not sure that is the reaction they were going for.
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing, they did their homework. Loved Krypton and the cameos of Lexcorp and Wayne Enterprises. Looking forward to more from the DC universe."
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,Hope this turns out to be a great series like the dark knight. love the graphics
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"Absolutely love it! Don't listen to the negative reviews! This movie is awesome! Great screenplay, amazing actors, killer effects and Zach Snyder and Christopher Nolan on board....What else could you ask for? I give it four thumbs up!"
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"The editing and the overabundance of action disrupt the pacing a bit, but it's nothing too severe that wouldn't make it an enjoyable watch."
"Jun 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,I didn't know I could hate a Superman film this much.
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"Super in parts, Weak in Others"
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,Don't care for the critics evaluation of this movie....Saw this and loved it...by far the best Superman movie ever!!! Go see for yourself!!!
"Jun 23, 2013",POSITIVE,It was kinda blah for me and our youngest but the rest of my family like it a lot
"Jun 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It strives for perfection but ends up having flaws in the process. While trying to make a very human and relatable Superman, it went the other way, using a familiar treatment as the Batman movies. Otherwise, everything was near perfect, also considering that we can't compare Christopher Reeve's version as it would be redundant. Overall, it's still a good origin movie. But I would rather have Goyer replaced."
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"I just watched Man of Steel, and I dont understand why it is getting bad reviews. Me and my husband, and a friend who came with us, all loved it. And me and my husband discussed it further when we got home and agreed it was the best Superman anything either of us had ever seen. Although neither of us have seen the Christopher Reeves movies since they came out before we were born, and they are too aged to watch now. But I have no complaints about Man of Steel. Not one. It found a perfect balance between darker emotions and intense action. I witness Clark's journey to becoming the man he needed to be, I witnessed his pain, and I felt his connection with Lois. Even though it was subtle, it was perfectly done. Lois was a strong female lead, the villains were menacing, the action had me grinning and gripped, the backstory was thorough and fascinating, the SFX and technology design were amazing, Cahill was perfect, there were no glasses on/glasses off moments, and corny comic book dialogue was not present. This was the best movie I have seen so far this year."
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,This is the greatest Superman movie of all time!!!!  This is a must see!!!
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"Finally someone can make this ridiculous super hero into more believeable! Epic fight scene here and there and more sci-fi. Really what i expected from a superman movie. Yes it is without a flaw. A lot actually. But this is superman movie we talking for. Hollywood never made it good. Hell even the legendary Nolan can't directly made it and make Snyder done it instead. But they need a better screen-writer. And Snyder still have movie cliches plastered all over his movie. If it'll have sequel i don't think fighting Lex Luthor, a mere human, is good choice. It will be like a spiderman movie again. I mean this godly super-human's villain is one and only alien race. Look at Dragon Ball. Speaking of Dragon Ball, Snyder need to make a Dragon Ball movie. I mean, hey, It more or less the same as Superman if you think of it!

Anyway, the best moment for me is when Kal-El fights Faora-Ul."
"Jun 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The first half of the movie does its job well: it draws the audience into the frantic plight of the Kryptons trying to save their home. The second half, however, is a chaotic whirlwind of gunfire, fights, and explosions. The action sequences are scripted well, but some characters are left with almost no background story."
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Just awesome and I want more.
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie. Very well done
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,A MUST SEE (many times!!)!!! This is one Bluray I will spend money on!
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Totally awesome.  Loved it!
"Jun 18, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Dumb & boring with very little character development. The final battle scene was cool for the first 10 minutes, after 15 we were just rooting for someone ,anyone, to die so it could just be over."
"Jun 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Was OK, but that's about it. Some parts dragged out, it could of been more interesting"
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great comic book movie, only exceeded by The Dark Knight Returns and The Avengers."
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Best superman ever :DD
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"Fantastic cast, great tone and storytelling.  DC, Snyder, Goyer and Nolan finally make the Superman story almost believable and as thrilling as a story about an invinsible man can be."
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"An amazing reboot of a great franchise.  In my opinion, this is the best Superman of all time.  Almost all the questions that remained unanswered in the past Superman movies are answered in this one.  I'm so happy that they focused more on how things unfolded on Krypton.  Cant wait till they make the next one."
"Jun 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Nolan did a great job with the plot, story and character development. Action scenes drug on to the point of being over the top and in some cases ridiculous. The back story and explanation of several plot points was done well without having to explain everything but also not leaving massive holes. Ending had some extremely out of place levity that left me with a funky flavor to finish with. I'd say its worth seeing in the theater if you can, if not, at least a rental."
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Good but still like the original
"Jun 18, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The positive: Henry Cavill really plays the role perfectly.  Some of the acting from Crowe, Lane and Antje Traue are great; everyone else is flat and downright bad.  

A small portion of the special effects are cinematic magic, then, there's just TV-version special effects like when Clark's on fire, it is bad, bad, bad. 

That's it for the positive....for the negative: 

Nothing original from storyline, it's either recycled, ripped off from other blockbusters, predictable (like I didn't see Pa Kettle's death once Clark said he wasn't his real father, oh, and Pa's final let it go, Clark...(corny). 

There's no humor, laughter, cheerfulness.  

Thank god there's tons of endorsers to plug in the scenes (IHOP, Sears, 7-11, Lexs Corp)...how many times can I see an explosion around a 7-11? Too many in this movie. 

The action is prolonged, often just a filler, I'd prefer the movie be 30 minutes shorter if you edit out al the overdone action.  

This movie is ostentatious, takes itself too serious, Clark is really dramatic and metrosexual. 

I still can't buy the whole nobody recognizes Superman because he puts on a pair of glasses.... 

The villain was a joke. 

The transition between scene or storylines was odd, I got bored and often didn't care."
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Really great movie..... Didn't realize that I knew nothing of his story lol
"Jun 18, 2013",NEGATIVE,"It so badly wants to be good, but Christopher Nolan's script diminishes Snyder's surprisingly well formed aesthetic. It throws away a lot of the things that made Superman's origin story so compelling, and replaces it with formulaic cliches. Still very entertaining, but just really disappointing."
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"Never liked Superman movies.  This was AWESOME!  Fabulous father and son movie.  Dads are incredible influences on the young man with strong, trusting Mother's to add support.  Excellent!"
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,it was a good family movie love it.
"Jun 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Riddled with scenes whose only purpose is to move the plot along. Superman just IS superman without having to sacrifice much or prove himself. The soundtrack becomes repetitive quickly. There was nothing really inspirational or profoundly meaningful in this movie that would make me watch it again. Nonetheless, it does provide lots of excitement and visuals, even if the rest of it is not as polished."
"Jun 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It's overlong and it has some problems with the pacing, but if you overlook those problems, you'll find a solid film."
"Jun 18, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Zack Snyder's delivering Superman is eye-catching and beautiful. David Goyer's retarded writing isn't. While the movie is a beautiful looking piece it tries to be bigger than it is with thin ideas and lengthy action-packed CGI while it shows the perspective of characters that don't matter to anyone, not even Superman himself."
"Jun 18, 2013",NEGATIVE,"So close to being good with much promise but no delivery. Great effects and good fight scenes, that should have been half as long as they were. Horrible script with no sense of humor whatsoever. Lastly, how can two invulnerable a try to kill each other for 10 minutes and then have one be upset when he succeeds. Then again, how can one suceed?"
"Jun 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,Explosions. lots of explosions. oh and then lots of awesome special effects. intersting story line. explosions.  explosions. interesting villians. explosions. genocide explosions. Zod. explosions.  and hella abs... a little bloated with explosions among other things. still a classy start
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"It's superman and I loved the movie√É¬∞???
Ooooohhhh yeeee"
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Definitely a Superman that fits well in a modernized era of cinematography. Also impressed with Synder's symbolism throughout the movie.
"Jun 18, 2013",NEGATIVE,"First third was awesome. But then, instead of developing the characters and trusting the story and writers, they decided to go with action movie formula and spend the rest of the budget on special effects. Dissolved into a mess."
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"great movie, very emotional and exceeded every expectation.  - a must see"
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Amazing! Best movie I've seen in theaters for such a long time!
"Jun 18, 2013",NEGATIVE,I wish I would have never seen it.
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"This installment provides plenty of EVERYTHING to satisfy even the most skeptical of believers. This movie surpasses everything else done in the DC universe, everything since the first Superman movie featuring Christopher Reeves."
"Jun 18, 2013",NEGATIVE,It was such a disappointment and over the top. The 1980's version beats this movie any day.
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"storyline could have been better, but the fight scenes are done really well and couldv used more of em. in general its worth wasting ur money on"
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"Despite a few plot conveniences, missed opportunities and the latter half of the film essentially being an excuse for copious amounts of destruction; ""Man of Steel"" is still a soaring success for Superman's return to the silver screen due to a well rounded cast, nice emotional touch and a massive epic scale with plenty of visual flair making this the freshest and most exciting take on the character in years."
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie has renewed my faith in Superman. Don't get me wrong, the first 2 Superman movies were good in their own right and time. And stepping in dog poop would be better than Superman Returns. But this movie had everything they lacked. Henry Cavill pulled off Clark Kent/Superman perfectly. Aside from a little shaky camera shots and some grumbly acting from Kevin Costner, the movie really outdid its predecessors. Krypton, flying, epic fighting, even Jor-El was portrayed great by Russel Crowe. All this and NO Kryptonite. NONE. Zak Snyder did an awesome job at telling this story how it was supposed to be told. I would gladly go see this movie again. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching movies. Go see it."
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,What you would want in a Superman movie.
"Jun 18, 2013",NEGATIVE,TERRIBLE this movie was all action no romance like most superheroes movie!! Ew gross  no never again!!! I don't recommend it for girls!!
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great Superman movie they finally were able to show what Superman can really do, with the movie CGI effects available these days we can all see the power of Superman on the big screen. if your a comic book fan of Superman  I strongly recommend this film"
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"it was an awesome movie. If you can handle a lot of action and explosions, then this is your movie"
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Excellent and entertaining. The critics got it wrong...again.
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"epic, what a reboot! way to go!!"
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"Yea, they took some liberties with the story and it's over the top with the Jesus references, but there are great performances and special effects.  I saw it in IMAX 3D and it was visually sensational.     Not for little kids - most of the kids hoping to see a comic book version had their heads in the mom's shoulder not looking at the screen for most of the movie."
"Jun 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The best part of this movie is the performance by the leading man, Henry Cavill. The redeeming factor that I was expecting to see (and Man of Steel delivered) was putting into question the notion of ""Good"" and ""Evil."" I loved seeing that this story line strayed away from what is right and wrong and dabbled into some gray. The action sequences were incredible! But, the pacing up to act 3 was incredibly snail like. Whether intentional or not, the first two acts left a lot unanswered (perhaps in an attempt to leave more to come in a sequel). By no means was this the ""Dark Knight,"" of Superman movies however, but maybe number 2 will be."
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"I thought this was a great version of Superman.  Those expecting Christopher Reeve's friendly, boy scout-esque Superman will be disappointed.  This is a Superman, at the start, unsure of his place in the world.  This Superman acknowledges he's not human, accepts that, and wonders what his place in this world of humans is.  He is also the Superman that I can see in the Justice League.  Superman is THE powerhouse of the DC universe.  He stops crimes, helps kittens, and is a positive influence because he's, at heart, the nice, all American guy from Kansas.  But when Kryptonians attack, when Darkseid comes a knocking, or Doomsday rises ready for destruction, it's Superman who puts them down, and puts them down hard.   Not knocking the Reeve Superman movies, but I like this aspect of him being shown now.  I look forward to this franchise continuing, and leading into movies for the greater DC universe."
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"I recently saw this a second time and...there were more flaws than I might've noticed the first time around.This is a perfect example of why seeing a movie twice helps form an opinion.The first time around I think I was blinded by fanboyism.The second time,I looked at it with a more open mind.Still though,Man of Steel is a great movie,and I can see why some hate it and some love it.I give it an 8.5/10"
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"an awesome, amazing, reboot of a classic."
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,From beginning to end you are completely pulled in. I absolutely loved this film. Lots of action and an overall great plot. I'd watch it again in a heartbeat.
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"I give the movie a 9.8 out of 10 they did a fantastic job of making a superman movie. They made superman seem more human then that of a all powerful god with one weakness, a hard thing to do considering  superman is basically a god"
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,This is why I dont like and dont trust critics.  This is a great movie.  Fantastic story and phenomenal fight scenes.  Just when you think its over it gets better.  I dont write reviews but I feel this is worth writing about. I saw this in imax 3D and I am proud to say I did.  It is a must see so I recommend seeing this movie on the big scene.
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"OK, so let me start by saying this was the BEST Superman movie ever.  That's just the plain and simple truth in that regard.  In every respect, this Superman *is* the Man of Steel.  The way a comic fan like myself wants to see Superman portrayed on the big screen.  Conflicted, yet pure by nature and nurture, and a good thing too because nothing could stop him otherwise.  This movie really showed the ""Super"" in Superman.  No doubt.

But comparisons to other Superman movie incarnations aside, this was really a good *movie*.  You don't have to be a Superman fan to get everything this movie has to give, and enjoy it like a roller-coaster ride.  If you like a good action/superhero/disaster movie, give it a try.  You won't regret it."
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Better than Iron Man 3!
"Jun 18, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Les d√©cors sont superbes, l'acteur principale (avec barbe) est hawwwwt, la musique est √©pique ! Mais toutes les r√©f√©rences religieuses, le patriotisme am√©ricain, le bad acting de certains acteurs et l'histoire qui tient pas debout g√¢chent vraiment tout le film... Mais √ßa reste un bon divertissement si on oublie les giggles de toutes les filles dans le cin√©ma ! =P"
"Jun 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,Could have done without the long drawn out stories that was told twice!
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"Good action, no more rescuing cats from trees."
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed this movie. But I feel it could have been better 7.5
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"It was everything I wanted it to be, a lone man longing to know his origin, and raised to make the tough choices with a good heart. Not to mention action galore, loved it."
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,The best Superman movie ever made (IMHO) and the best superhero movie since The Avengers...
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"Very surprised this film is getting so many bad reviews. A couple of my friends said it was awful and it was a 55% on RT. I enjoyed it though. Plenty of action and a really good origin story. It's no TDK, but its fun and entertaining."
"Jun 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,It was pretty good lots of action but it was sorta cheesey at parts
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie ever.
"Jun 18, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Beware, I go into spoilers very quickly in this review.  Man of Steel holds a distinction with me, because no other film has ever made my heart sink so fast.  This film had its positives and its negatives and it was feeling OK until Superman snaps Zod's neck and kills him.  This film lost me at that point and will not recover me.  Superman does not kill, that is all wrong.  It is not what Superman is about and I do not believe that they should have had that as the conclusion of this film since it is such a huge contradiction of the Superman character and what he represents.  This single moment essentially ruined this entire film for me.  Now, despite my strong feelings about the climax of the film, there are some good points that I did enjoy about the film.  I did enjoy the action sequences; the fight scenes were well done and it was nice to see Kryptonian powers used to their full potential, since that is something lacking in previous Superman films.  Also, it's a small thing, but I really enjoyed how Superman was flying.  I liked when he was hovering in front of the military base; it looked just like Superman in the comics.  It was a great touch.  I also enjoyed the sequence at the beginning with Clark wandering, trying to find himself.  It reminded me of the 1986 ""Man of Steel"" comic origin, where Superman anonymously saved people for years before he took on the Superman identity.  However, I didn't enjoy the integration of Grant Morrison's more recent ""Superman is an alien, focus on making him an outcast"" theme in the film.  I felt like there was so much focus on making Clark an outcast and an alien that I didn't feel his bond with the other characters or the people he was dedicated to helping.  I didn't like that Jonathon Kent perpetuated this ""outcast"" in his upbringing of Clark; he didn't feel like the Pa Kent that shaped the good hearted and strongly moral Superman of the comics.  I also didn't like that Jonathon was willing to die for his dog and force Clark to watch him die instead of letting him save him.  Pa Kent was the opposite of what I expected of him.  I didn't mind Zod and his Ursa stand in; they were good villains and portrayed well enough.  Amy Adams' Lois Lane didn't stand out a lot to me; she and Cavill didn't have a lot of chemistry, and the story didn't really romantacize Superman and Lois as much as I expected.  The story just kind of forced them together as a couple and it didn't feel organic or classic.  I did enjoy Laurence Fishburne's Perry White, though.  Small part but good.  OVerall, this film was not what I had hoped for a reboot.  It didn't boil Superman to his most classic and fundamental elements and exectued in a fresh and authentic way, something that Batman Begins did so well and I prayed would occur as well.  Instead, I got a drastically different characterization of Superman from those fundemental ideas, and whatever good that was done in the film was overshadowed by having Superman take a life."
"Jun 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Thanks to director Zack Snyder and script by Nolan and Goyer this is by far the best Superman film to date...but not perfect.  Before I get into that I'll start with what is working for Man Of Steel.
The opening of film feels like it's straight out of the comic book and I for one dug it.  I could have watched a full 2 hours with the entire film set on Krypton.  The cast was great and I enjoyed all the performances, especially Michael Shannon (General Zod), that guy has got some serious talent.  The action/fight scenes were handled extremely well and...well, I expected that from Snyder given the specificity to fighting style he brought to 300, so Zack and his team are in fine form here.  Next up is the almost popular debate ""how does one write an interesting story when the main character is all powerful?""...simple, we keep in mind he is an alien.  If you've watched any of the other films you know this to be true but it is interesting how quickly we forget.  Lastly, the numerous messages throughout the film, hope, acceptance, tolerance and working together, to name a few, are all important and good for younger audiences to hear too.
Now the flaws.  I'm okay with letting a few flaws go.  But, the big flaw for me was how fast Lois Lane gets around.  I can live with a few of the cheesy scenes and dialogue to match but feel no need to delve into that too much here.  The pacing was tight for Man Of Steel and if you miss a moment here or there then you might get a little lost...there is merit in letting the audience fully ingest new ideas and connecting ideas but I can also see that being a tricky thing to figure out.
To close, this a fun summer popcorn movie and should not be taken too seriously because it is entertainment.  So sit back and enjoy, I did."
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,What a good twist to an old story of time. It was good
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is a good superhero movie. It's not as great as I wanted it to be, but it's not a terrible movie by any means. The first two acts are stellar and work well, but in the third act, the movie gets a little too caught up in the action. Good performances throughout, especially Costner & Crowe as the father figures in Kal-El's life."
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"Awesome, awesome, awesome! Best remake of all time. Finally!!!"
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Henry Cavill is too sexy for words. cant wait to get it on bluray for instant replay ; )
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"Outstanding movie. Fantastic story, action and it was visually fantastic. He is a perfect superman and great support from all the rest."
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Great rendition of the classic Superman story.  LOVED it!!!
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,EVERYTHING a superhero movie should be!
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,fenomenal...aunq algunas cosas raras...bruuuupp.!!!
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,It's an amazing superhero movie. The best I've seen after The Dark Knight trilogy which Man Of Steel imitates but isn't really as succesful.
"Jun 18, 2013",NEGATIVE,As if the makers didnt know what to do with Superman except make him fly...
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie! these movies critics don't knee SHIT! Action-packed, great acting, interesting approach to the story, and very heartfelt.. You HAVE TO WATCH THIS IN IMAX-3D!!"
"Jun 18, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This dull and disappointing super hero movie has a very small amount of humor, joy, and romance. It literally feels empty. Not to mention Superman never smiles! I think it's casted wrong. Almost forgot the major problem, it goes on far too long, and that said guess who's controlling the film the whole time? Nobody, just loud noises and action. Which is stupid, director Snyder should always know the most important thing about a movie is the characters."
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"Although not as good as The Dark Knight trilogy, Man of Steel is a solid origin story that has a strong philosophical story, spot-on casting, and well-done action sequences. This is a film that I hope gets the praise it deserves as time goes on."
"Jun 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,More a story of the man behind the cape. No cheesy jokes throw at you like other superhero franchises such as iron man. If you want a serious movie you'll enjoy man of steel
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Great Movie Love Supeman!
"Jun 18, 2013",NEGATIVE,a rehash of a mixture of superman 1 & 2 with some minor changes 3/10 would not see again.
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Better than the dark knight rises
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Wow! Quite possibly the best super hero movie ever!
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Vigorous and Entertaining.
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie did not disappoint.  I think they did an amazing job, and loved the re-boot.  Superman was brought to life in this movie!  I don't think it was that violent at all, no more violent than any other superhero movie...loved it, my husband loved it, and so did my kids!"
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie couldn't have been better
"Jun 18, 2013",NEGATIVE,Hanz Zimmer was the only good thing
"Jun 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It accomplishes what needs to be accomplished in order to move the franchise forward. Seeing Krypton in such amazing detail was a major highlight for me. Special effects and action are top notch. Character development, well there wasn't any. Hopefully the next chapter to this story will be something we haven't already seen multiple times."
"Jun 18, 2013",NEGATIVE,Action filled reboot that lacks soul.
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome movie!!  A must see!
"Jun 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,no story I miss chris reeves
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"Thought this was a great reboot of superman and a great way to bring superman in to a more realistic light. Great acting, great visuals and good storyline. Wish they would have given a hint of what part will look like but they didn't. Way better then superman returns......that movie was terrible. Can't wait to next the next one comes out this is a must see!"
"Jun 18, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This is a good movie - a really good movie. It was pretty well ruined, though, by overstated cinematography, poor storytelling (seriously, what's with the flashbacks?) and a director's gigantic, looming John Hancock through which it's really quite difficult to see the actual movie."
"Jun 18, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The ""action"" scenes, especially the last one--were repetitious, overlong, and boring. And there seemed, in the end, no reason for Superman to win. He just did. There were some interesting moments near the beginning, the early history, etc., but not enough to carry the film through the seeming unending fight scenes."
"Jun 18, 2013",NEGATIVE,"For a Superman movie that I was really looking forward to, I was so underwhelmed, bored and confused, along with unwittingly criticising it while watching it... ugh."
"Jun 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Buen giro sobre los or√≠genes de Superman, pero la comparaci√≥n con Jesucristo fue un poco obvia."
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"Mientras la mayoria cree que esta pelicula es un bodrio donde solo hay abundancia de accion y actuaciones planas mi opinion es distinta, disfrute mucho el regreso del abuelo de los superheroes, sobre todo por las nuevas visiones y actualizaciones de puntos dados a la historia, dejando atras otros ya convencionales dentro de este superheroe, aunado a un si existente lado humando de Clark Kent y dialogos memorables dentro del guion sobre su necesidad de coexistir en la Tierra y como inspirara a la gente de la Tierra al ayudarlos a enfrentar adversidades, todo esto junto con un deslumbrante estilo visual, actuaciones de primer nivel y un memorable score, aunque claro esta que perfecta no es."
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"Okay, what are critics thinking?!? They rated Superman Returns 75% of critics liked it. Really?!? Kate Bosworth was a horrible Lois Lane and that is only the beginning of hat was wrong in that film.  Man of Steel takes the cake for best Superman movie ever!! It is a refreshingly new take on Superman's story.  Pretty much everything is new and it makes sense.  The world Warner's Brothers created in this film suits it perfectly.  Now, if only we can get the fan support to launch a DC universe.  Calling all Big Bang Theory fans!!  Seriously though, Man of Steel delivers in a big way.  Good acting, good story line, great action!  I will say the action was a little too much but that seems to be the problem with all action movies these days.  I highly recommend they focus a little more on story line next film."
"Jun 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed the movie but felt like a lot was crammed into it, even though it was ~ 2.5 hrs long.  Due to that, I think it jumped around a little  too sporadically.  The serious of the plot and the imminent threat to Earth was what kept me hooked though.  With that in mind, I didn't mind the ending too much."
"Jun 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"It seems that the critics wanted the fun, romance, and humor of some of the older portrayals in Superman's long history, but I thoroughly enjoyed this more non-linear, realistic portrayal of the man of steel (or as realistic as a storyline can be about a super alien). It seems to be a modern ""fad"" to dim down the unrealistic and larger-than-life energy of these comic book movies, but it is not one I am opposed to or sick of at this point. I think at this point, the world needs a more human approach to inhuman characters, so we can find ourselves not only fantasizing about them but also empathizing with them. I think the non linear storyline of this Superman movie adds to the self-examination that has always plagued many superheroes....especially with Clark Kent/Kal-El. I like that the movie focused on his own journey to figuring out what being a good person means, let alone figuring out what it is to be a super man. Just my two cents."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"The critics might be crying over the lack of comedy in Man of Steel but I could care less.  This is the reboot that Superman needed.  DC Comics and WB should be very proud of this movie along with Chris Nolan and Zack Snyder.  This film brings the ""Action"" in Action Comics to life finally."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Wow this movie was awesome way better than the last one I enjoyed the way the director did the story line!! Great movie go see it!
"Jun 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Don't listen to critics, judge it for yourself. This movie will prove to be ahead of its time...I've seen it twice and I'll proboly go again. BOOM!"
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Epic in scale and played pretty straight despite having Amy Adams as Lois Lane.  Despite the action scenes it is very much a slow burner but the destruction of Metropolis in the films climax was worth the entry fee (although I watched it in 3D, which despite adding some depth to the scenery it doesn't really add much to the film experience)."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel was darker than any of the other Superman movies, but I found it very believable.  Here we see him as a small boy grappling with his unique abilities such as being able to see through people and things, and super hear. We see how it really would make someone who doesn't know what is happening to him act and react. We see him being non violent so as not to hurt anyone with his super human strength and we see him doing good even though it might uncover his secret.  I liked the way Lois Lane was introduced early on in the story and not later on in his life.  The acting was great as were the special effects.  The story was pretty true to the original but much more fun in so many ways. I would recommend this movie for all viewers, except for kids under 6.  I took a four year old. He loved the movie but some parts did scare him. Go and enjoy."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Everything i've been wanting to see from a Superman film. actual ""action"", lots of heart & a pretty good script. Not perfect, but not expecting perfection on a reboot to the origin. Looking forward to part 2. ENTERTAINMENT is a key word, & all I can ask for from a comic book flick"
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie! Can't believe that it's not getting a better score.
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman to date.
"Jun 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Actors were great, but the story was too choppy. Not BAD, but not GREAT. And with Superman, not great is a big disappointment."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"When we get to earth the film slows down for a bit; It isn√¢??t boring mind you, just slower. Snyder effectively weaves foreshadowing, past events in Kal-El√¢??s childhood, and the present existence and nomadism of Kal-El along with Lois Lane√¢??s career and the military√¢??s investigation into something peculiar. Kal-El travels from job to job so that he remains anonymous and so he is never found after he displays his power or ability to save others in some capacity. It is interesting to see some circumstances in which Superman had to hold back his powers as a boy because his father Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner) told him that the world may not be ready for him and that he needs to keep his identity a secret until the world is ready.

Snyder said that in this film Kryptonite would not even be introduced. Superman√¢??s weaknesses would have to be emotional weaknesses, or struggles within. Although it wasn√¢??t clear to see his struggles within, the very few people he did care about were put in danger multiple times. The main targets of injustice were targeted at Martha Kent (Diane Lane) and Lois Lane (Amy Adams).

An Entertainment Weekly story featuring some quotes from writer David Goyer mentioned the effort for empathy for the main character and that if Superman were in a street fight with some aliens and a train, you want the audience to care more about Superman than the property damage. While I agree with that philosophy, the aesthetic way in which the property damage was created was definitely the most pleasing thing for me. The fights between Superman and his fellow Kryptonians were amazing, and now I can see a little more why this film has taken sooooooo long in post-production and visual effect editing.

It almost felt to me like this was two different movies. The first hour was separate because it had his origin, his present, and sporadic childhood scenes or adapting to this new world with his powers, but not a ton of action. The second 1.5 hrs were focused more on the action and Superman having to stop Zod do some crazy stuff to our planet.

There wasn√¢??t much in this movie that didn√¢??t work for me. Amy Adams climbing on a mountain early on to investigate something felt a little far-fetched, Lane√¢??s and Kent√¢??s relationship also was put together pretty quickly, and it didn√¢??t feel intense or emotionally connected, especially when you see the circumstances surrounding it. I also did not love Jonathan Kent√¢??s exit in the movie. He constantly tells Clark to suppress his powers until the world is ready and then Clark is forced to watch him get sucked into a tornado because the old man couldn√¢??t resist the urge to run back and save his stupid dog!?!?  Really?!?! Other than that I thought Costner√¢??s performance and role fit perfectly.

"Jun 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Lots of gratuitous action and decimation of cities and loss of human life that the superman i remember would have never allowed. In the course of fighting one man, Zod, an entire city is almost leveled and countless lives lost. The look was uninspired with hints of both The Matrix, Thor and Prometheus abound"
"Jun 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,Ah It was only good for the action that's all the story was meh and the acting could be better they change pretty much everything and left out things that should never be taken out just another disapointment movie to me they will never get it right stop with the remakes try and think of something new
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,awesome way better than superman returns a really good start cant wait for the sequel
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Good movie didn't slow down, meaty content.   Thought the tenticle fight was a bit over done, but the rest of the fights were off the chain!   I was in love with the female Kryponian."
"Jun 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Man of Steel is the sixth major motion picture adaptation of the seminal and iconic DC Comics character Superman, and the third iteration of that superhero within film franchise history. Superman first graced the silver screen in 1978, with Christopher Reeve donning the red cape and blue suit and Gene Hackman taking on the role of Superman's archenemy Lex Luthor. The 1978 Superman was the first in a series of four franchise films, which include the 1980 seminal classic Superman 2, 1983's abysmal Superman 3 co-starring an astoundingly miscast Richard Pryor, and 1987's ridiculous and oft-forgotten Superman 4: The Quest for Peace. Where the first two Superman films were lighthearted, romantic adventures with a wide appeal and strong grounding in the Superman mythology established by DC, the second two films in this first motion picture franchise lost sight of the mythology and adventure inherent to the Superman story, becoming lost in a mire of attempted pop-cultural relevancy and pretended socio-political consciousness. And yet, Bryan Singer's second iteration of Superman in 2006's Superman Returns didn't fare that much better, possibly suffering from too much of a penchant for mythology and romantic derring-do. With such a history of Superman as he has appeared in film in mind, Zach Snyder's third attempt at translating the great visitor from Krypton in Man of Steel becomes all the more interesting in terms of any hopes of reinvigorating the character with a sense of contemporary relevancy and staying power. 

	Unfortunately, Man of Steel is not quiet the breath of fresh air that Superman so direly needs for his current image in the minds of cinephiles. Snyder's Man of Steel is unfortunately yet another tired, beleaguered, action romp, filled with an over abundance of explosions and dizzying fight sequences sure to send even the most exuberant fan into a state of despondency and queasiness. While certain performances, such as those offered by Russell Crowe as Superman's father Jor-El, and Amy Adams as the infamous reporter and love interest Lois Lane, are fantastic, often carrying entire scenes on the weight of their backs, the film that surrounds them is sub-par and frenzied to the point of near-incoherency. Snyder is more likely than not to blame for this, as his track record betrays him to be a director of comic book adaptations which divorce their source material of any underlying story, opting for the sheer thrill of orchestrating elaborate special effects sequences which are often nauseating instead of thrilling. Regardless of such an opinion, Snyder's relative success with such films as 2009's Watchmen as well as the run-away blockbuster smash of 2006's 300 point to the continuing career and relevancy of Snyder in mainstream Hollywood fare, Man of Steel more likely than not included.

	With such a view of Man of Steel in mind, as well as the current state of affairs in terms of adapting Superman to the silver screen accounted for, one question comes to mind: why is Superman, an iconic figure in his own medium, so incompatible with contemporary cinema? Is Superman, like Marvel's Captain America, simply too idealistic and archaic for the contemporary consciousness to fully swallow? Or is his story too innocent and chaste for an audience which longs for the morally ambiguous and sexy comic book superheroes such as Batman and Iron Man, both of which are characters who have recently made the leap to contemporary cinematic narrative effortlessly and to great critical success. Superman is no doubt the ideal man and hero, but is he the same kind of hero that we want or even care for any longer? As popular American morals and ethics have changed since Superman's initial creation and appearance in 1938, perhaps our interest in him has changed as well, creating a gap between his story and the one that contemporary audiences want to see him take part in; a story, moreover, that he can never hope to fit into, no matter how much Snyder's new film attempts to mold Superman's character to the new American consciousness.

	Zach Snyder's Man of Steel can thusly be seen as being in dialogue with Christopher Nolan's vastly superior Dark Knight Trilogy. Nolan, in fact, wrote the original story for Man of Steel before backing down from the project and letting Snyder take control of the new franchise in his stead. Snyder is obviously inspired by Nolan's dark modern fairy tale that is the Dark Knight Trilogy, and at times Man of Steel comes close to achieving some of what makes that trilogy so affecting. Unfortunately, Snyder's debt to Nolan doesn't progress beyond aesthetic admiration, leaving the film philosophically stagnant and emotionally vacant where Nolan's trilogy was intellectually charged and filled with character and plot driven tension. It's hard to say why Man of Steel should be seen, probably because Snyder had trouble crafting a story for the Superman character that matched the tone and dramatic urgency that flows through Nolan's interpretation of the Batman character. It's also hard to put the blame entirely on Snyder's shoulders, as it might just be the case that the patriotic flair and moral righteousness of the Superman character is just not current enough to match the tastes of a contemporary movie going audience eager to grapple with a world that is fraught with the same kind of moral ambiguity and ethical ambivalence that plagues our own. Maybe we just don't need Superman anymore."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,It was a pretty good movie. It is a reboot and try not to think of the original movie. This seemed more real than the original. The visual effects are way better of course. Henry cavill is a good Superman. When I went to see it I wasn't thinking about the original!
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"I have said it for a number of years. If Warner Brothers and DC Comics wanted to do another Superman movie they would need to do a modern take and really reinvent the character. Man of Steel (2013) did exactly that. With some of Superman's campier aspects noticeably absent from this film (kryptonite, red underwear, spandex in general) Snyder's interpretation of Superman was superior to all other Superman movies. While it may not be as legendary as the Superman Movie (1978), it certainly is more current and more realistic. While Lois Lane and Clark Kent's relationship is a little underdeveloped, Snyder at least gives the audience plenty of spectacle and eye candy. And what I loved most about the movie was its focus on Clark's relationship with his two fathers. With strong performances from Henry Cavill, Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe, and Diane Lane, Man of Steel takes its place as one of DC Comics better movie attempts while never quite getting to the level of the first two Nolan Batman movies. I give the film 3 1/2 stars."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"""You will give the people an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun. In time, you will help them accomplish wonders.""

It's been quite a long time since we last saw Superman. 7 years since Bryan Singer's ""Superman Returns"", the somewhat sequel to ""Superman II"" starring Brandon Routh as Superman. It was...okay, I guess. It wasn't a very epic return, I should say.

Fast forward to the present: Zack Snyder's ""Man of Steel"", a reboot of the Superman franchise starring Henry Cavill as the world's very first superhero (Google it, I dare you). This is pretty much the only chance Warner Brothers has to launch a DC Comics film universe AND a Justice League movie. 

So does this film save WB's chances with DC?

This movie is very much like Superman: it does that and so much more. ""Man of Steel"", in my honest opinion, goes down as one of the best comic book movies in history. 

Yes, it is better than ""Iron Man 3"" and ""The Avengers"". Which basically says DC is about to give Marvel a run for their money if they don't sit down and do a good job with ""Thor: The Dark World"" (at least, that's how I see it if the next DC movie turns out to be just as good as MOS).

""Man of Steel"" is about Kal-El, the last son of the dying planet Krypton. In hopes of letting their child decide his own destiny, Kal's parents send him off far across space to Earth so that he can live amongst them as one. 

Prior to Kal's departure, a hard-headed Kryptonian called General Zod demands the high council to give him the highest power on the planet in order for him to claim the codex, an ancient artifact that holds the former souls and power of past Kryptonians. It is powerful enough to create an entirely new Krypton in order for them to survive, but only at the cost of wiping an entirely different planet to extinction by changing everything about it (yeah, that's a mouthful). 

Without consent, Kal's father steals the codex and drains it's energy into Kal himself, making him more powerful than any other Kryptonian and making Krypton die even faster. Zod is arrested and locked away in the Phantom Zone, a prison designed to hold the most powerful beings in the universe.

Krypton only had Zod serve for a long period of time and by the time of his release, the planet no longer existed to stop him from furthering a new Krypton. 

However, Zod needs the codex in order to do that, and only one thing contains all of it's power: Superman, the Man of Steel. Or Clark Kent/Kal-El, whichever you prefer (The name Superman doesn't show up very often). 

The plot itself is very well-handled, but there are some noticeably weak spots that jump out every once in a while that make you question things, but nothing too big for your brain to comprehend.

Let's start to break things down.

Henry Cavill is the perfect Superman hands down. He has the look, charisma, voice, and body for the role. Cavill brings a very emotional and ""human"" side to Superman, a side uncertain of who he is destined to be on Earth and if he should let someone die for the greater good of himself or others. Something that we can finally relate to in this nearly invincible character and paving the way for new fans instead of always falling back on relating to Batman (who is my favorite hero, but I digress).

Michael Shannon walks the line between hero and villain as General Zod. You understand why he does these things: he was raised to protect Krypton by any means. Very much like dying for your own country, and that is where Zod and Superman come to a brief understanding. It's also refreshing not to see a villain given the Hannibal Lecter/Harry Houdini/trapped-in-a-glass-box-without-any-possible-way-to-escape schtick (ex. Joker, Loki, Silva, John Harrison, etc.), to be able to give the villain freedom in order to fully understand him.

The supporting characters are strong for the most part. The 20 minute scene on Krypton was enough time to show the importance of Russell Crowe as Jor-El as well as pre-recorded holograms left for his son later in the film. 

Amy Adams is questionable as Lois Lane and there wasn't enough going on with her character for me to even show praise or criticism. Sorry folks, that's just how it is.

Kevin Costner shines as Jonathan Kent, Kal's father on Earth. While he is about as much screen time than Crowe, Costner adds so much more to some of the most powerful scenes I have ever seen in a comic book movie. 

I will say ""Man of Steel"" has action you haven't seen since The Matrix Trilogy. It is THAT GOOD and is not afraid to hold back by any means. The sound can be quite jarring at times, but you come to the realization of where you are and what you are watching: Superman. It's going to be really destructive. I recommend not taking anyone who has sensitive hearing because the action can come across as a tad obnoxious when it doesn't let up and you have to wait half an hour so that your ears can rest. Not a huge issue, but it slightly bugged me.

Hans Zimmer, who previously teamed with Christopher Nolan (former Batman director, MOS producer) as the composer for The Dark Knight Trilogy score, returns to score ""Man of Steel"" and it is POWERFUL. Granted, nothing may never be more iconic than the John Williams score, but that's what I love about this: it doesn't try to be John Williams. It does it's job by setting the mood with great harmony and destruction when needed.

The effects are fantastic, and to anyone who says the CGI is way over-used: we don't live in the 70's where we constantly have to string up the actor so that it looks like he's flying. It's Superman and he is a character who needs effects that can't be triggered by a normal man. That's why he's called SUPERman.

All I can say is, Zack Snyder has impressed me again. It started with ""300"", then ""Watchmen"", and now here we are with ""Man of Steel"" (surprisingly without any slo-mo shots!). Snyder has outdone himself as I went into this movie not being too fond of Superman at all and walked out wanting to know so much more. That's how it's done and that's how it SHOULD be done to prove films like this deserve more recognition than they get.

""Man of Steel""
9/10

By the way: don't bother sitting through the credits. This isn't Marvel ;)"
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Henry Cavill nails it like Christopher Reeves did. In fact I enjoyed him just a ton more. Amy Adams was horrible as Lois Lane and they should really think of replacing her. The rest of the cast was really good with Michael Shannon just being MESMERIZING as General Zod. I'm calling him General just in case Faora is reading. There are several nods to Superman 2, worth ones, and there's a lot of kinetic action happening which has left people complaining, but it's Superman. He moves fast and it was epic fights. A little more care could have been placed in Superman caring for the people in the tons of buildings being demolished but stopping the action so he can save a bus or something doesn't add value to the movie. It may have been better they left that aspect out. Overall you will regret not seeing this movie in 3d. Amazing new franchise!"
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,awesome movie. love it. I don't care about if it don't have ebough humor or love. I go to the big screen to be entertain and Men of Steel deliver just that.  so f the critics!
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Fast paced with a great new telling of the Superman story! Lots of nods to the original story while updating and adding information that made more sense! A few very emotional scenes mixed into an alien movie! It was better than I had even hoped! The only downer was, even though I liked the back story parts with Ma & Pa Kent, I found myself wanting more of those scenes! The final fight sequence was amazing and reminded me of the Spider-Man 2 fight scene with Doc Oc!"
"Jun 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The CGI went on and on and on.  Two and a half hour movie which allowed the CGI team to try out absolutely everything they've ever wanted to create.  Well guess what, it took over the movie and destroyed the story.  Turned into a boring movie with a lot of destroyed buildings ( which we knew wasn't real).  Directors! take back your movies.  Tell us a story and use CGI to enhance he story, not bore the audience."
"Jun 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,Yawn! Too long to get started & overall about 45 minutes too long!
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Early reviews of this movie (based on watching the trailers) describe this movie as ""epic"". I stood with those reviews and was pleased to discover that it was exactly that: epic.
A very emotional, dark and story-heavy script with ""faster than a speeding bullet"" action sequences and an occasional ""shaky cam"" look; Chris Nolan has once again turned a D.C. legend upside down. The only disappointing point about this film (and this is VERY picky) is that it did not feel like a Zack Snyder film through and through. I saw elements of his brilliance during the flashback scenes when Kal is remembering his childhood and adolescence (some of the best cinematography I've seen Snyder do) but the rest could have been done by another director and I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference. 

Also, if you are a fan of any of the other Superman films; you may be sorely upset. The opposite applies if you disliked the others: this film was made specifically for your benefit."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,I like the plot changes...
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,I waited a little over 2 years for this film and I was not disappointed.  admittedly different from all the rest it is most assuredly a step in the right direction for a modern day Superman.
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Very good.  It seems a lot of reviewers didn't think the origin story deserved any screen time.   I was glad that enough time was given over to setting the stage and really defining how Superman came to be the person he is and not just leaving us to make assumptions.  It also delivered plenty of examples of extreme ass-kicking.  If you think the Avengers can ruin a city then you aint seen nothin.
"Jun 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,"So Superman gets another re-boot, and they call in the big guns Snyder and Nolan. Pity they never spent a few of those dollars on a script and story writer. 

This film hits the screens with big expectations and anticipation but fails to deliver just like most of Snyder's other films. What we get instead is the re birth of the Superman franchise, which instead of being a genetically modified testube super baby, feels more like a swift Razzle induced J.Arthur and a turkey baster back street attempt at conception. With a plot stolen from the first ten minutes of Superman and most of Superman 2, means the only new thing being Superman's new onesie. This leans heavily towards the Dark Knight Style one colour Lycra job, and no bright red pants. Then again every chav twat walks around now with their trousers around their thighs showing their pants, so Superman needs to have a less dumbarse look. 

So what was wrong with it, quite simply more style over substance. You can never really get into the film or attach yourself to the hero. He's more of a brooding sulky loner than any of the other incarnations and has no on screen presence. This is not necessarily Henry Cavill's fault, he can only bring to the show whatever the director lets him bring, in this case not helped by the paper thin storyline. As for the rest of the cast, Russell Crowe was decent as Jor-El but as we know he doesn't last too long, although his Arnold Rimmer hologram does make a few later cameos. Amy Adams as Lois Lane never really gets going as did Lawrence Fishburne playing Perry White, whose future career is clearly morphing into a combined replacement for James Earl Jones and Morgan Freeman, as the deep voice wise old sage.

Now without ruining the ending for you, but still slagging it off. It is the most overblown load of bollocks my arse has fallen asleep to whilst watching in a cinema. It feels like you are stuck in a room watching some acne ridden 14 year old playing his Xbox and you cannot find the off button. We see more buildings crumbling to the ground than a Fred Dibnah wet dream in a Lancashire mill town in the 70's. Essentially all the budget went on CGI and bugger all on the screenplay meaning a bit of a two hour borefest."
"Jun 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Overdone on action and special effects. Nothing really fun, romantic, or special about the storyline. Very little character development. Made me miss Christopher Reeves. Incredibly disappointing."
"Jun 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,more of an action movie than a comic book movie but great execution. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
"Jun 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The start was a very star wars and quite entertaining, then the rest of the movie happened. They found a way to make a movie involving a flying superhuman very dull. The fight scenes were repetitive and pointless. Wish I watched it at home, at least then I could have talked during it there. Thank goodness we didn't shell out the additional money for 3D."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Great action and a great starting point for the Superman reboot.
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,loved it and he was sooooo hot
"Jun 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,It is a cool film. I enjoyed the history lesson on his parents and planet. Christopher Reeves is not forgotten.
"Jun 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,It was way to serious. Some bits felt like I watching a video game
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,The best Superman ever made loved all the action from the start till the end loved it so much I watched it twice
"Jun 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,"An excellent setup for future films, both MoS sequels and other DC character tie-ins...it's not a perfect film, it drags on a bit too long toward the end, and it's nowhere near as compelling as Batman Begins was....but it's still an entertaining relaunch of a character around which all others revolve. The backstory with both Jor-El/Lara and the Kents is very well done...and I loved Costner as Clark's dad. I can't wait for the next one...and for a JLA film!"
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Don't be put off by the critics, best superhero film of the year. I loved every minute of it"
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Seriously what is with this rating? This movie was spectacular.
"Jun 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I know from the comments below that the movie is extremely polarizing for fans of the Superman mythos and genre. Here's my two cents. (Spoilers abound in this critique).

From the time I saw Donner's Superman at the age of twelve with my father, I was hooked on the character. That irrepressable goodness and saint-like quality. Truth, Justice and the American way. The whole concept of him being an alien with unbelievable abilities combined with a remarkable humility that perhaps you'd have to be alien to possess these days.

And yes, the character stumbled through films. S2 fantastic and better than S1 in my humble opinion. S3 and S4 being movies you would love to forget. Superman Returns an admittedly confusing film that just exuded sadness and a seeming inability for an established superhero to fit in (Krypton being dead and Superman having seemingly abandoned the Earth). I've loved much of the 80s in the comics during John Byrne's reimagining of the character. I also relished Tarantino's somewhat out of place analysis of Superman in Kill Bill 2, recognizing that Superman is somewhat unique as origin stories go in that he is always Superman and Clark Kent is his disguise to pretend to be normal and blend in.

Now we have Man of Steel, which truly does feel as a few fans have remarked, more of a sci-fi film than a comic book. There is nothing wrong with that in my opinion. I loved the retelling of the origin, although it was more militant than it probably needed to be. Everything with Snyder seems to be militant and evisceral. And yet, he captured for me the essence of Superman. A fear of discovery despite being invulnerable. A desire to belong even though he couldn't really belong. A desire to find a destiny when you don't have the answers.

I suppose every superhero film needs to have protracted violence through a villain/anti-hero/whatever. Honestly I probably could have sat through two hours of Superman doing remarkable things like the oil rig etc without a protagonist, but to each his own.

I loved every minute of the film until the scout ship. Did I miss something about them sending him to Earth because there was a scout ship there? Why didn't Jor El put information into the actual ship that sent Kal to Earth? That was odd. The whole scout ship thing was too convenient and unneccesary to me, but ok.

Onto Zod. I think Michael Shannon is a phenomenal actor. Why he had to be so 2D in the film I am not sure. I would have thought such an intelligent individual would have made far more of an effort with Kal El than he had before locking him up etc. I suppose you could be that arrogant and self absorbed, but after witnessing the end of your planet, perhaps a change of heart could have occurred and made Zod more complex and likeable.

Well after that we just get all the senseless violence and ""splosions"", and Kal/the audience doesn't even have a chance to assess his choice of genocide for Kryptonians because we learn nothing of what Kal discusses with his father really. We just see him fly away with the ship and then Zod is on the scene. That was a great opportunity lost to develop a conflict for Kal El.

In any event I digress. The gratuitous and seemingly endless violence suggests that Metropolis is all but destroyed and Superman's place in the world is unsettled. That would I suppose be the end product of everything but I wish there had been even five minutes of movie time devoted to the fallout. There is none. I loved the character's remorse at what he had to do to save everyone, but the remorse was misdirected at the one life he had to take vs all of the lives probably lost as a result of his decision to keep the fighting local to Metropolis. Clark just jets on the scene? Really? Very disappointing. But then again, Very Snyder. I hope there was some cutting room floor on this. I would have loved to have seen Superman flying around Metropolis doing more in the aftermath than saving Lois and a few frightened citizens.

Kind of reminded me of the neat and tidy end to the second Star Trek movie (which I won't spoil in this thread of course).

In the end, I can live with the fact that this is a Superman for our times. It may not be the Superman we loved from the various prior imaginings, but I for one would rather have these films to enjoy than to see the genre dead and buried.

Here is to hoping WB can pull off Justice League. Man do they have their work cut out for them."
"Jun 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Oscar worthy visuals that are worthy of a nomination, but that's about it."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"an excellent reboot focussing more on Superman's past and his heritage which, for a family historian, is a great story."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,best movie of the year
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,great movie and awesome story as well as the characters being portrayed.  let me on the edge of my seat..
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"for all the action, it was a bit boring"
"Jun 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I know the audience loves action and to see the man of steel fly at Mach 1, but honestly I thought the film only focused on Superman and his role on Earth as a regular man. In fact I really did not like the orange hair girl playing the role as Louis Lane, and I honeslty thought they could of picked a better woman. Other than those those cons the action scenes were pretty cool."
"Jun 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The problem this movie had is that it couldn't commit. If you're gonna make Superman complex, then you can't cater to the entire mythos.... no Lois, no Daily Planet, Just a man and his dilemma. It had some really great moments but in the end, It was so hard to care about the Metropolis characters, and so it became boring. If they had just focused on Smallville, Clark, Jor El, and Zod it could have been great... instead too long and boring, and no development of any characters beyond the Kents and the Kryptonians. BTW Crowe, Costner, Lane, and Cavill were outstanding. Lois should have been left out of the story entirely... Amy Adams was awful (surprisingly because she's usually great) and I was actually hoping for Lois to die by the end.... that's how bad this movie is."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"It's not the Superman movie we deserved, but the Superman movie we needed.  Dark as in serious, with little room for humour.  Action packed, with solid acting throughout.  Cavill makes the role his own, with no disrespect to Christoper Reeve.  

If you wanted to see Superman kick ass and get his ass kicked, this is the movie for you.  For all the Superman 2 fans who wanted to see the fight recreated with modern technology, your wish has been granted.  If you were expecting Twilight with Lois and Clark, prepare to be disappointed.

Some negatives were the movie was tuned a little loud for my tastes, and the action in the end was a bit much.  On a second viewing it did not feel longer, and the chaos at the end makes more sense (it really sets up Superman's Kobayashi Maru at the end of the movie)"
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"I love this movie an jus abt everyway. The action, an the story. For all of you ppl tht was looking for a love story. This isnt gone with the wind. Stop looking for your 1970's superman. Catch up with the times"
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Great Movie! It showed a realistic view of Superman's personality from his adolescent years to his adult years.
"Jun 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The last 25% of the movie was wacko, but I really enjoyed the first 3/4.  Still, I'd say it was the best Superman movie."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"It's abundantly clear that movie critics are WAY out of touch with the moviegoer. Great, fun movie, NOT worthy of the low 56% rating. The 82% is much more accurate. Never trust a critic.....sheesh."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"In my personal opinion this is truly an epic superman film. It brings a seriousness and realism to the whole series. I am actually quite surprised with the negative reviews on here. I mean what were you expecting when you saw this film? A family friendly happy kid movie with jokes and laughter? Are you serious? Would you have liked it if general Zod had a rousing musical number? Yeah I don't think so. And to all those who seem to think there is symbolism or some lame religious tone to the film YOU ARE WRONG. You obviously went in from the start hating this film as this is all about a man sending the first natural born child and sole survivor of his dying world to earth to be raised with better moral values so that his dreams can live on. Christopher Reeves is dead ok! Of course no one can replace him but remember his superman was in the 70s and to be honest those are WAY outdated . Henry Cavill was indeed a good choice for the role of Kalel and as a whole this has got to be the best reboot of a franchise I have seen to date. That is all. If you don't like this film I don't know what to tell you. It has sadness, emotion, action, and a villain with a all to familiar motive albeit twisted. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would."
"Jun 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Whilst certainly entertaining and visually impressive this is not a film that I can see having a lasting impact. Apart from the scenes involving the Kent family there is a lack of emotional involvement in the picture. Michael Shannon is a little miscast here, usually impeccable as a loner or outsider he is not quite believable as a leader of men."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Good flick, for entertainment purposes only. Dont expect a black knigth kind of profound story."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Okay My Superman Review. I'll keep the spoilers out as much as I can.

Just to save you time, I like to give you the verdict before I give a lengthy review. I give it a B- which usually ends up in my collection worth re-watching, and visually stimulating. Now you can read my personal review.

As you know Superman movies are a hard thing to make A.) Relatable B.) Avoiding becoming campy. This movie was action packed, and well delivered for a Modern audience. As you seen with many old franchises they put a level of detail that is border on the insane, as well set pieces that put you into the world of the characters. First I'll say the Effects were Stellar, Krypton has its own feel. Very Art Deco with a flare of Flash Gordon mixed in. I was surprised that this worked as we know with ""Alien"" races in other movies, they always go with a 3D Hologram, neon light show. It was nice to see this look and gave it a unique feel from Earthlings native habitat. The CGI blended well with the action as forces collide on the big screen showing that you can do an over the top super-battle and have enough realism not to take you out of the movie like some films have done. Zack Synder went all out and tried to make this memorable. From The Fall of Krypton to Smallville and Metropolis and back. 

Now the Story was an origin story. Now as I said this is a Goyer/Nolan script so they are lifting from multiple stories from the original comics/graphic novels and smooshed it into a workable 2 hour and 24 minute movie. Now I didn't feel like it was 2 hours which is actually a good thing for a film. But at the same time some characters weren't fleshed out over this time. Lois was a notable problem as we learned not a lot about her during the course of the film. I do feel that her character scenes were probably cut for time but Goyer really doesn't right strong female leads. It would have been nice for a little scene or two about her and her budding relationship with Kal. Hell I would have liked more interaction between Zod and Jor-El since it didn't feel for me like a close relationship as it was stated in the movie. So for me a bit weak there but I think they mindset for this movie. Don't Suck like Superman Returns story wise. Focus on the Action and the origin. Don't Suck, which it didn't I am glad for that.

Music which is important to every film was great. Now many of us who lived during the Reeves Era knows this theme and everyone tries to emulate it. In this movie it's not present and has its own theme that fits the overall narrative. Hans Zimmerman's track you can hear power behind it, something raw and forceful. But at the same time it can be soft, gentle and intimate. It doesn't drown out the scene but builds on them. From the subtle piano when the Kent family together to the thumping of war drums when Zod and company are destroying everything. Which for me is something I want, that fills in the void and not a generic carbon copy of the great John Williams theme. 

That is all I have to say enjoy action superhero movies, you're going to like this movie."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Critics need to understand the genre and actually spend time reading the comic literature before critiquing the film.  Man of Steel is the best representation of comic source material since The Dark Knight.  This film has to be viewed from a different lens in order to truly appreciate what Zach Snyder and David Goyer have brought to us this summer.  Absolutely loved this film and will be watching it multiple times!
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"I saw this movie twice in 24 hours...once for free.  After the first viewing, I felt a little disappointed, but I did not know if I thought it had a little too much action, or if the new vision of this franchise I had waited 32 years for just did not match my old ideas of who and what Superman is/was.  However, after the second viewing, this movie is awesome and is a great start to what this fan is hoping is a lengthy rebirth of a superhero icon.  Although he was great...it is time to say goodbye to Chris and say hello to Henry."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"The 44% of the critics who disliked this film were WRONG!  Finally a Superman movie with a good villain who has a logical reason for his actions instead of villains who are nothing more than cartoon characters.  Finally a Superman movie with real action!  Finally a Superman movie where the world is initially afraid of him and he has to prove himself!  Finally a Superman movie where he has to make a tough moral choice.  Finally a Superman movie with good writing instead of huge plot holes that rely upon ""deus ex machina"" plot points to save the day (Time travel? Amnesia kiss? Throwing an entire continent into space?)  I saw Man of Steel twice, and it was even better the second time."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,just saw it and loved it. I loved how they went into detail in how superman came into earth.
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"As a comic nerd for the past 43 years I was amazed at the job done with the Big Blue Boy Scout. The tweaking of the story brings the great history up to date. Finally Lois is not just a damsel in distress. She was portrayed as a Great Reporter. Superman/Clark Kent showed his turmoil and fears. These have always been in the comics and has always been viewed as a weakness. The world today is as fearful as ever, and as a father I related to Jonathan Kent's fears for his son. I've read a lot of people expressing disappointment with the death of Zod, I must say I was shocked. Superman did not want to do it, and his pain and agony are shown in his grief and disappointment right after the killing.  Zod left him no choice, and in so doing Superman did what any policeman, soldier, or hero would do to save innocent lives. The action was very fast and spectacular. I tend to lean towards Batman, and this update gave Superman more humanity. In so doing made him more relatable he was not a god on high, but a man with a soul and heart. Job well done!"
"Jun 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,Great special effects but it was the Transformers plot all over again.  Two aliens battle over the source of their world and destroy a bunch of buildings along the way.  Kinda lacks the original superman feel.
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,how can you say this movie was bad in any way. all the critics on here dont know a good movie if it hit them in the  face. This movie was highly entertaining from beginning to end with a great story.  i will no longer use this site to get movie reviews as the critics clearly get paid off. how can anyone say iron man was better than this.
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,I thought it was an amazing interpretation of Superman's story. It is very challenging to make an interesting Superman movie and they definitely pulled it off. I give it a 7.5/10
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,just saw the movie and I don't understand why all the bad reviews never will it compare to the original with christopher reeves that will always be the classic but the new one was just as good if not better with keeping up with the times I think the second one will be even better can't wait long live superman!!!!
"Jun 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Man Of Steel is an undeniable visual feast, but suffers from a messy narrative, a lack of real focus and an uncertain tone. It's seeded with promising ideas that never grow to their full potential, opting to emphasise more on multiple action set-pieces that ultimately bog down the third act."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Awesome action with the right amount of build up! As a longtime comic book collector I throughly enjoyed it. This movie is what I love about comic books and it was brought to life on the big screen. Now whose job is it to clean this mess up, Metropolis look like it needs some work."
"Jun 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Boring pretentious with a horrible script, such a shame..."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,great story and direction! excellent job of cast and production! deff a must see for the summer
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Oh my goodness...Im such a critic when it some to new ""supermans"" cause Im such a Christopher Reeve fan! But I must admit this was an awesome movie! This dude in it, almost resembles a young Christopher Reeve, if you look close enough he almost looks like they could be related...but the story was told awesomely! Everything about it was amazing! I hope they make another one, cause I would love to see how they take this new superman to the next lvl!"
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,I don't care about the okay reviews I thought it was brilliant
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,I don't understand all of the bad reviews on this movie. I really enjoyed this movie. It is the first superman movie that I have wanted to see again.
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,I don't understand all of the bad reviews on this movie. I really enjoyed this movie. It is the first superman movie that I have wanted to see again.
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Superman done right!
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Loved the remake, very gritty action packed film."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"The long awaited, and much anticipated reboot to the Superman franchise has finally been released to the world. Man of Steel has been hyped up since the first teaser trailer was released a year ago, and the hype kept building with each incredible trailer that was released since then. Warner Bros. made every effort to make sure that the people knew from the start that Christopher Nolan (producer) was involved with this film, as most fans know him as the God who revitalized the Batman franchise. Although Christopher Nolan did have a say in the making of this film, this is very much director Zack Snyder's film as he converted the writing of David S. Goyer into a visual masterpiece.

Before I continue with my review of Man of Steel, let me address a couple of things that I keep reading from critics who are not pleased with the film. There are a couple of points that the critics keep throwing out there that seemed to have ruined the movie for them. The first is that there is too much action. Too much action, you say? Please. After years and years of complaining that the previous Superman films didn't have enough action, the critics have the nerve to now ask for less? The critics and the fans have been craving for a Superman film that would allow us to see what power he's truly capable of displaying. Superman is, well, super human, and any confrontation that he has with a being of equal strength will certainly be a violent and disastrous encounter. Superman versus several super villains? Even more destructive. What the critics don't seem to understand, and what Snyder, Nolan and Goyer have been telling people since day one, is that this is a ""what if"" movie. What if Superman appeared in a realistic world and had to fight off a super army in order to protect mankind? Would there not be destruction and death? Of course there would. Superman can't save everybody, and as much as some critics like to think of Superman as being almighty and not letting a single soul perish, the reality is that in the heat of a battle, it's just impossible.

The second thing that I keep hearing from critics is that it's not wholesome and campy like the Donner film of 78. Well, duh! This isn't a Donner film; it's a Zach Snyder film and his take on this legendary superhero. This is its own movie. Any comparison with this imagining and the Donner film is just ridiculous and should really be ignored. Again, you wanted action? You got it. And now that you got it, you don't want it? Hmm, I'm so confused.

Snyder makes use of visual effects very well, and completely immerses the viewer in a world (Krypton) that completely awakens the imagination. This new depiction of Krypton is something I've never seen before (besides a couple issues in the comics), and really captures some of the culture and technology of the Kryptonian world. One could get the sense that Krypton could really exist in our reality, and that perhaps Earth may look similar (in terms of technology) one day in the future.

The story is told in a non-linear fashion as it uses a great deal of flashbacks, and this works perfectly in getting the story of Superman across to the audience. It allows for a certain flow to the movie that prevents it from dragging and helps keep the viewers to follow along in its entirety. It's a creative and refreshing new way of storytelling for a superhero movie.

Man of Steel is full of suspense, drama, and of course it packs a lot of action into the two and half hours of film time. The action, as I mentioned, is a welcome addiction for any hardcore Superman fan that's been drooling at the mouth for a good Superman fight for decades. With Superman Returns leaving much to be desired, the fans have finally received what they've been asking for. Superman takes on Zod and his army all by himself, and takes a pretty good beating in the process. A couple of times throughout the movie, he takes on three of Zod's soldiers at once and gets punished for it as a result. The destruction that ensues during the fight scenes is exactly what one would expect to see when God-like figures do battle on Earth. Sorry critics, buildings aren't made of rubber. There's mass destruction, so deal with it.

There are a couple of moments in the film that seemed awkward, or forced, but it's nothing too bad and definitely doesn't take anything away from the film. Overall this is a very solid Superman movie, and definitely a great way to start the new franchise. The potential to build from this movie is so great that it's exciting to see what they do next. Rumor has it that both Snyder and Goyer have already signed on to do the sequels, so that's definitely great news.

I give Man of Steel a solid A."
"Jun 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,"David S. Goyer, the writer of this Superman reboot, has stated that the 'world needs this right now.' With that, he has written a dark and somber ""real world"" origin story in the same vein as his previous franchise, Batman Begins. Whereas then he had the craftsmanship of Christopher Nolan (now acting as Producer) behind camera daily, he now has action-centric Zack Snyder serving as director. Snyder is good at making visual effects 'work' on camera, but storytelling and the nuances of pacing has never been his strong suit (and if you're making a 2  1/2 hour film, that matters). It could go down to script or directing, but this film just never takes off. There are moments I enjoyed (everything with Russell Crowe), but when you get down to it; this movie is very bland and forgettable. If this is Goyer's interpretation of what 'the world needs right now,' then get ready for The Age of Unsubtly, where gray is the color of hope and explosions the chorus of applause."
"Jun 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,"They should stop making films this boring, because then people get bored. Logic."
"Jun 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,Everything was there except a better story..
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"""Man of Steel"" 10 Scale Rating: 9.0 (Amazing) ...

The Good: Superman is finally updated and made relevant to the masses. Is it an exact interpretation of the comic book character? No, it isn't. It is a modern Superman for a modern world and is extremely well done. Well acted, especially Cavill, Shannon, and Crowe. This is how a super hero franchise should start and I was impressed with the depth of the script. The flashbacks were extremely well done and helped move the movie along by skipping past yet another origin story in the opening act. The sci-fi elements and stressing that Superman is indeed an alien was a good call. Clark is isolated and alone, which was far more realistic than one would expect. Exceptional fight scenes that put the sheer magnitude of the powers involved on display. 

The Bad: During the final battles, the sheer amount of damage done and death was dizzying. It got to the point where I actually said aloud ""Why is anyone still in the area?!?!"" Some people are annoyed that Superman didn't save everyone, but that was sort of the point ... he can't save everyone. Shannon was up to the task and Zod was very cool, but came across as more than a little ham-fisted at times. I would have liked him to be more of a combination of wits and force instead of relying almost solely on power."
"Jun 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,The most appropriate thing about this movie is that it isn't called Superman.
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome movie whats wrong with the critics these days?
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"First off, this is NOT a Superman movie, it's a FAN FICTION based on the world and characters of the Superman world, but has nothing to do with the canon, so treat it as such and don't judge it as a genuine Superman story. 

With Nolan on the credits I had pretty low expectations for this movie, being the most overrated director of our generation, with a filmography full of halfassed movies ridden with atrocious plot holes and elementary characterizations with a certain mix that appeals to the simpleminded and makes them feel smart. But I'm glad to admit that I was pleasantly surprised, the Nolan effect was probably minimal -except for the parts where the story tends to shuffle beyond logic for absolutely no reason- the story was not a Nolan faux dramatization, it had hints of Snyder's style of drama, with some outside influences. 
The movie uses characters and details of the Superman world, but just goes on a totally road with them, creating their OWN version of a disturbed, loner, and actually a little bit sleazy Superman, probably an attempt to humanize the character, and focus on this whole ""Alien"" thing the movie so fondly put up at the center of attention, which was never as prominent in the Superman world before. 

The Script itself had some weak spots, and mainly this weird shuffling of falshbacks and cutting to unrelated events was mainly strange, plus, the characterization had some depth problems when it comes to the characters, which is still forgivable for a comic-book movie. 

Directorial style was a mix between faux docu-drama with those snappy zooms and stylized action, which surprisingly, for an action hater like myself, was just the right amount, and done with dignity and style and in good taste, unlike the other meaningless, headache inducing crap -especially the final 30 mins of Inception-."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel is a step up in the right direction for WB/DC Entertainment. The rebooting of Supes story is Miles away better than Bryan Singer's misfire ""Superman Returns"" for those who want the bright, campy feel of Richard Donner's Superman you not getting it from Man Of Steel. Henry Cavill's brings some sort of wholesomeness with Clark Kent/ Superman and Amy Adams gives a tough, smart and confident Lois Lane. The visuals in the film are at times jaw-dropping and effects are the big show stoppers but, the flaws started to show especially during the final battle between Supes and Zod. It's was during the Smallville battle that the fight was incredibly too long and starts to bog down the story in the climax it was the same thing. the other thing was how some of the characters in the film didn't have enough screen time (To me). A lot of nods to the rest of the DC universe in the film, besides the two hiccups it was an enjoyable film 4 stars"
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"This was a solid movie. It was not perfect, but far from poor. It was entertaining throughout. I did feel it was a bit more death than there should have been for a superman movie, but thats the way the cookie crumbles."
"Jun 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,Superman is a man's man! This whiney little pansy sure ain't Superman!
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,I LOVED IT! best superman movie to date!
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,man of steal is awsome I love him better thatn batman
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"It didn't quite stand up to Nolan's other works, but Snyder and Cavill pull together an admiral movie. I like the look, and the darker side of superman that is revealed. A few laughs are thrown in as well. Overall, a success."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Very nice long fight scenes are the big draw of the movie.  When I felt the movie was at its end there was still more.  I felt it did a great job of telling enough background on Krypton and just enough of Clark's childhood to get the teachings of Jonathan Kent which is what makes Superman who he is.
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie is so damn Epic !!! A masterpiece and a must see !
"Jun 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,"To sum it up, I would say Man of Steel was cool but not good."
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"I was surprised to see that the Rotten Tomato critics gave it a 56%. the movie to me was great and expected it to be rated in the low 90's high 80's. I loved that we got to see more of Kripton and Ger El, as well as great character development. The action scenes blew my mind. I wanted to super powered beings fighting and I got it. Super man was the Super man I grew up with as a boy and I got that. The critics must be tired of seeing comic book movies doing so well."
"Jun 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The story is there, but I feel like it could've been presented better and more clearly. I blame this solely on the director who I always felt would hinder this film because of his style. But at the same time he's probably the best guy to show moviegoers just how cool Superman can be visually. He packs plenty of action that has always been missing in past Superman movies. At the very least it keeps you entertained."
"Jun 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,No humor and too long
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,It was an enjoyable movie.
"Jun 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,Dissapointed....not the best Superman movie!...:-(
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Great film. Very good fight scenes and a great sound track to go a long with it. A great reboot to the Superman series.
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,amazing visually and the storyline was consistantly great.
"Jun 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Zack Snyder is a visionary. I'm not a big sucker of CGI, but Man of Steel definitely makes Avengers look so trivial. We all know now that Snyder has mastered the art of graphic imagery in films (may be Rodriguez is close; imagine if Snyder & Rodriguez pair up, holy shit!), but the way he showcases the sheer power of superman makes Ironman look so stupid. And Cavill is a fine lad, no I'm not missing Reeve here while Russel Crowe delivers a fine performance after his equivocal character in Les Miserables. Hans Zimmer is brilliant as usual. And Snyder is a clear winner here. I agree what the film lacked was some humour, but it wouldn't have suited the theme, this is no IronMan and isn't supposed to be funny alright. I'm just hoping the Nolan-Snyder pair come up with more in the series. And it was one of the best non-IMAX 3D experiences for me! Bravo Zack!!!"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie is one of the best I've ever seen.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Good movie, not a huge Superman fan but this was pretty good. Definitely worth seeing on the big screen."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,Omg Clarke is soooooo hot and amazing!! I loved this movie!!
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"I really don't like Superman, but I loved this movie, so that should tell you something. Yes, it has its flaws. The CGI is definitely overdone... but it sort of needs to in order to depict the kind of fight scenes people have always wanted from a Superman movie. Decent enough acting, fun plot, the kind that none of the movies have really had before, and great action all added up to a great movie for me."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"""Man of Steel's"" first 90 minutes are some of the best pieces of film I've ever seen. The character development, the storytelling, the soundtrack, and the visuals collaborate together perfectly not only to evoke massive emotion into every viewer, but also to make them think - a bold strategy seldom employed by screenwriters and/or directors. The team of Snyder (300 and Watchmen) and Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy, Memento) prove to be successful, and thoughtful. The score, while not to the calibre of Star Wars, Jurassic Park, or Lord of the Rings, stands on it's own as powerful, rarely tender pieces that fit the film perfectly. The Cinematography seems heavily influenced by Nolan being on the team, resembling a Noir-esque feel at times with harsh shadows and singular light sources often employed. Snyder understands the flaws of the original film, and its sequels, correcting many of them with the opening sequence. Unfortunately, Snyder's vision does not resemble a Feature Film at all, but a pseudo-documentary, almost as if detailing Superman's life as a Second-Person observer, involved in the events, but ignored by everyone else in the film. This is solidified by the fact that the shadow of one of the cameramen can be clearly seen during one of the flashback sequences, which, to me, made the film more like a documentary, or a homemade movie.

What absolutely kills ""Man of Steel"" is the shaky-cam zoom-lens combination; apart, not necessarily bad things - for example, Hitchcock and Scorcese have both independently and effectively used a counter dolly zoom to achieve a dramatic effect and films such as Cloverfield and even portions of The Dark Knight have employed the shaky-cam to a varying extent to increase dramatic tension or recklessness. In ""Man of Steel,"" for the first 20-30 minutes, depending on the person, it feels out of place, nauseating, and reckless in a film driven by order. This isn't a horrible feature of the film, and it certainly doesn't mean you shouldn't go see it. What it boils down to is that prime lenses have been the Hollywood standard since the creation of the camera, and every invention for camera movement has been to prevent shaking or excessive motion (steadicam, crane, dolly, etc.) What Snyder's Director of Photography does here is separate ""Man of Steel"" from Hollywood completely and make the look of the film similar to a home-video. This will either enhance or detract from the film, depending on the viewer, and is something, again, that each viewer will adapt to on his or her own terms.

Above, I spoke of only the first 90 minutes, basically, until the action starts. I am the first to say I love action films; there's something about crap blowing up that's wicked cool. That being said, the 45 minute long action sequence bored me and left me wishing that 45 minutes had been re-allocated to character development of either Zod, Martha Kent, Johnathan Kent, or Lois Lane. This is the only pitfall in terms of the pacing of the film. I hate to do this - I really do - but what I equate that whole sequence to is the final fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan in Revenge of the Sith. The sequence is flashy, well-produced, and action packed. The problem that both share is that they're long, drawn out, devoid of emotion, boring, and tensionless; No spoilers here, it's a bunch of nearly indestructible Kryptonians duking it out leveling Metropolis. Ironically, the minute long sequence (you all know what I'm talking about) with Zod and Superman standing still, instead of flying all around the city playing tag, is more entertaining, engaging, and emotional than the rest of the mind-numbing action. Is it cool to watch an entire city leveled? Yup! Does it make for great film? No.

No complaints on the cinematography, or the score for that matter. I will say the Trailers' scores are better, but only just.

Clark's and Jor-El's character development are fantastic, 10/10. The flashback narrative and the opening 15 minutes are worth the ticket price alone. I do wish Snyder would've spent a bit more time on the Kents however, but that development suffices for what the film is.

There are one or two minor plot holes that don't impact the film too significantly, so I won't discuss them in depth.

Overall, a solid summer blockbuster sure to rake in the dough and please audiences. 8.5/10"
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,Masterful in the cinematography and art direction. Three- fourths were flawless with the last quarter turning into a CG tech demo. Excited for where this new Superman is going.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,i expected more but oh well cant do much. good fight scenes.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"I honestly have never liked superman because he was too super and too perfect. But I absolutely loved this movie. The first 30 minutes felt different because of the style they chose to put the film together, but soon I grew to appreciate it, especially since it almost felt like the plot was stitched to flow just like a comic book. Excellent movie."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Disappointed. Superman Returns was far better than this new one. Henry Cavill was okay, but the story was
 disjointed, there was no character development and the endless smashing of buildings got boring. No iconic music, none of the traditional Superman hallmarks. It was just like any other action movie, only with less story because the makers assume you know
 everything going in. Meh."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Go see it. Epic film. Don't listen to the critics. If you're expecting a great Christopher Nolan film then this film delivers, and then some."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Must See!  Great movie - love they way the condensed this down - nothing short on action and I love the twist on Lois Lane -   This is an easy re-do movie - I could watch it again.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"I find the people get movies more accurately than the critics.  I understand that a particular movie might appeal or not appeal to someone.  I personally did not think Iron Man 3 was as good as the critics thought it was not the people..... but it was still good.

Man of Steel is an excellent origin story of Superman.  How any critic can think this movie was terrible is beyond comprehension.  I think they are still holding on to the Christopher Reeves style of Superman which was excellent in itself.

Some said there was little character development.  One can say the same about Star Trek, so what's the difference?  I think there was the right amount of development not to overwhelm us with a story and characters we already understand.  There were no loopholes in the story line, it was spectacular to watch, the villain felt real, with a purpose, and not an idiot. Henry Cavill was an excellent choice for the role.  And the superhero battles were quite amazing.  You really got a sense of how powerful Superman is and how helpless any normal person would be against him."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,Esta pelicula tiene muchos mas errores que el solo hecho de que existan mas explosiones que verdaderos personajes.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Though its grounded in sci fi roots it still maintains an earthy realistic tone.  You can feel Superman's struggle.  Slight changes in story give you mixed emotions for the fan boy in me, yet the spirit of superman was captured well.  Great action scenes and superb acting."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Compared to the 1978 version, it is humorless.  too serious just like another Batman movie. It really is just another big action big CG movie. And what is with Lois knowing Superman's true identity from the start? This Superman looks like he spends a lot of  time lifting weight in the gym."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,Better than the previous superman movie. The movie was too long both at the start and at the end. The high point were the fight scenes that were like a live action Injustice: Gods Among Us video game.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This is... A Superman and its good, but thats not to say its without problems. One huge one being no theme music!!! I'm just saying the greatest music score in the history of movies and nope... Not one note! Kill yourself! Superman is good. Why is Louise everywhere in this movie, but no romance? Why... OK I wont ruin it for you, its a good movie overall go see it."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,When in with an open mind. No matter what anyone says- go see it and come to your own conclusion. This guy is Supes- no doubt about it! As for Zod? That's another story as I wasn't sold on him or the actor playing him- period! The reason I rated 4 is because I didn't feel Supes mother on Krypton wasn't believable- but that's just me. Its totally a darker tale of Superman but totally acceptable with me. You get bored of the same formula after awhile so a change is welcomed in my eyes. Lois Lane was/is sexy- hell yeah- finally!
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,best superman movie ever
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,... Greatest movie I've seen in quite some time.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"When watching Man Of Steel, you are reminded of other movies that came before it. The opening, as the camera tracks its way through the inner caverns of Krypton, you can see the definite parallel with the opening of Tim Burton's Batman. This simultaneously shows what is good and not so good about this movie. While trying for the things other super hero movies did right, it looses a sense of uniqueness; but when it does do something completely different, it falls short or even overcompensates, loosing something else all together in the process.
I did like this movie. It's a definite step in the right direction. The action was right. The threat was appropriate. The differences were dramatic and does make its own statement. The loner angle was appropriate, and felt right for the character. It's very good. Still however many steps this movie makes up, it never reaches the top of the staircase. 
1. The editing. This movie is pretty much separated into three parts. Krypton, Story, and the Action. The Krypton parts were shot in order, and for a precursor to the main story, was rather long. Too long. For a movie about Clark Kent / Kal-El, a lot of this movie happens without him. 
The second part, which is the basis for the rest of the movie and sets up all the conflict and missing parts of Clark's story, is told out of order. The story goes back and forth, between present day, and flashbacks to different parts of Clark's childhood. It's not the way I would have done it. It feels disjointed, jumpy. You loose investment in what's happening, even if you do flash to a childhood story, it kills the moment, so you can focus on another moment. If it was more sequential, I feel that there would be more emotional investment in the individual scenes, and give you more of a chance to get involved in Clark's life. 
The action portion, which takes up most of the final third of the movie is what this movie will male its big impact. Visually, you grip the power a Kryptonian has on earth. IT's a remarkable thing to watch...for awhile. The more you're exposed to the power of it, the more you get used to it. It looses its power and punch. In the end, it was just too much, even though it was good. 
2. Zod. This was not the performance this movie needed. Faora, the second in command, was the real standout in this movie. She will go far in the future. Michael Shannon, sadly, did not measure up to the name. He was good, but not menacing, not scary, just not enough. 
3. Lois Lane. I didn't feel her personality was strong enough. She did not feel like the go getter reporter in this movie. She felt like the one in the wrong place at the wrong time. It's like they chose to highlight the damsel parts of the comics and not the hard nosed ,proud, pugnatious Lois. She has more personality than this. 
4. Not enough Clark Kent. Just, not enough. 
5. The music. The music was great, but there wasn't enough of it, at least not enough variety. There are only so many times you can hear that theme before you want to hear something else. It's a shame too. I really like the theme, just not enough to hear it 5 times in the same movie. 
I have no problem with the tone of this movie. It understands the weight of all the topics it touches. Alienation, loosing parents, destroying the earth, trillions dead...how can any of that be taken in a positive way, other than overcoming those obstacles. 
It's a B- for me. C+ if you're in a bad mood. I consider it a fresh tomato, only because of its brand new take on this character.
Would I spend ten bucks to see it? I don't know. If it comes to IMAX or 3-D, no. I'm not sure if I'll buy it on dvd. I won't on blue ray. It all depends, as always, on you. Your mileage will vary. 
The amount of times the world has been saved by people in funny looking outfits now takes away from how special a movie like this can make you feel. Superheroes are everywhere. Constantly looking out for us on celluloid. Having fun or brooding, inventing new gadgets or throwing themselves in more and more dire situations to save the innocent and greatly numbered people of this planet. Bombs, invasions...the list grows at the number of ways we are put in danger. Out of all the men and women who put on a mask to save our hides, the question must now be asked, what is so special about Superman, now? 
This is what this movie tries to show you. His ablities, his personality, his upbringing, all point to the service of protecting us. He's an alien, but that's nothing we haven't seen before. He had a troubled childhood, but Bruce Wayne has put into perspective just what the word troubled means. The world is faced with a crisis, for the thousanth time.  The good guy wins in the end...but who would guess that? I comes at a price, but what doesn't? So, why this story? Why Zod? In the end, it comes to this, tying up loose ends. Clark's kryptonian roots had to be synched, to make way for greater stories. This, however, is no real reason to make a movie. 
The real overall tone and point of this movie is alienation. It really does make him feel isolated, and gives hope by the end of the movie that he will finally connect with the people of earth, even through the flimsy and beginning relationship with Lois.
This movie has promise. I would edit it differently, but that's just me. It will return interest to the character, and bring kids back to the first super hero. Is it good cinema? It's fine. Just fine. However, fine doesn't make for memorable, which is a shame."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,NOT the Avengers. Sorry. Over complicated and over elaborate narrative. It goes on and on and on like a history recital or sumthing. Terrible story. Good graphics.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Critics are stupid. Half a star gone for the kill and other faults.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Really good movie the action was great the actors were awesome and the special effects were insane.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Much of the criticism of this movie was accurate in that it was not the Christopher Reeve Superman. The old superman had Clark Kent a character that you may remember from Kill Bill was a condescending way for Superman to blend in. Clark was a bumbling stuttering coward because that was the old superman's idea of what humanity was. The new Superman was not Clark Kent at all he was Kai-El a sad and lonely Alien who was sent here by his dad to decide if we are worthy of saving, sound familiar? The fight scenes were tightly shot and a little shaky which did not work as well for 3D, I guess fist fights between indestructible beings can get a bit tedious. But I like this Superman and I like this movie everyone did a good job with their parts, With Russell Crow, Michael Shannon and Diane Lane leading the way. Krypton wasn't just an ice ball this time instead it was a rich in culture with very cool technology reminiscent of Dune with a bit of H. R. Giger. You are going to hear a lot of stuff but know that Man of Steel is a pretty good Sci-Fi movie about an alien who people think of as a superhero. And oh yeah it is really loud."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Didn't care about the fist fight scenes (I guess it's a must for superman).  But the opening scene with Russel Crowe was awesome.  He proved that he still got it!  Reminded me of Gladiator.  He was the star for me even though he was in a supporting role.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Thank god we have our own opinion . These critics got it all wrong . This was finally a dark superhero movie that didnt take three hours to show us how he or she becomes or developed`s  to save the day . No humor . Ya right . You all have personalities like house plants . So tired of the kid verson of superhero movie`s where nobody dies its boring, predictable, but still spit them out like broken records  . This movie is fast paced, action packed, and an original story line. If you v been waiting for a dark S.Hero movie . This is IT!"
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"While MOS wasn't as good as any of Nolan's DK  films, I did enjoy it a lot. It was a quality film, but not a classic."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Relentless. This isn't your fathers Superman and I guarantee you haven't seen a live action krytonian like this before. Fast paced and serious in tone I enjoyed every minute. My only concern is that Sndyer presented such an epic tale one might wonder what is left to tell. I go see it but not sure how a sequel bests this story. A must see in the theater!
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"AWFUL! 95% special effects, with only tiny bits of story sprinkled in to justify it. Obvious product placements! Wanna save 8 bucks? Here it is: baby born on planet with everyone blowing everything up. Gets sent to earth. Bad guys from home planet show up and start blowing everything up (including IHOP, Sears, 7-11, and a UHaul van you can rent for $19.95!)"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"If entertaining is what you need, this is the movie you should go and see"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,A great start to the summer movie season.  Loved to see this new version of Superman and can't wait to see where they take him in the future.  Henry Cavill is a great Superman.  How long till the next movie?
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Wow!!!! Highly recommended ..../ √∞???
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,I HOLD MY PEE TILL THE END OF THE MOVIE!!!
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Nolan and Snyder finally do justice to the greatest superhero story of all time.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"56%  lol yeah, I'm sure This is the End is a better movie (sarcasm).  This movie is really awesome.  There are some great moments that to me help you get a better understanding of what happens to Krypton and exactly what kind of man Jor-El is.  I also love that we finally see a superhero movie where the power level of the hero feels right, almost the whole time.  Don't listen to the Tomatometer.. that thing clearly doesn't work.  Go see it and if you can, see it big and 3d.  Will be going back for seconds, that's for sure."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,alot of action and awesome visuals. i loved seeing it in imax 3d!
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I was really looking forward to Man of Steel because I love the Superman character and what he stands for.  I am left disappointed yet again.  Not as disappointed as I was from that abortion of a movie that came out a few years back but still I am left wanting more story and character and less CGI crap.  I liked the movie for about the first two thirds and then it collapsed into yet another boring let's destroy everything CG battle. I hate to say it because I never want to sound like an old man yelling at today's kids about back in   my day but the first 2 Christopher Reeve Superman movies are still the best. I don't feel like that old man because my 5 year old son turned to me at the end of the movie and said ""that was just ok Dad"". You're right Dec, Man of Steel is just OK and Superman  deserves better."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Saw MOS tonight.  Really enjoyed it.  Don't know what the film critics were watching.  Emotionally I could identify with the question of Clark's search for acceptance.  Some critics seemed anoyyed with Jonathans and Martha's concern that he be outed as a alien.  In reality this would undermine our religions and cultural superstructures, and he would clearly be feared and probably hated. As Goyers dialoged"" we fear what we don't understand and cannot control.""  Others focused on the amount of mayhem unleased in Smallville and Metropolis in the final act.  While it was a little over the top it addressed two things that needed to be included in this film.  First it is common comic icongraphy that Superman and whatever super villan get thrown though building.  It's just expected and that's what we got.  If you leave if out, it would have been missed.  Second, in my opinion one of the main problems with Singer's Superman was almost nothing happened that was super except for catching the plan and pushing the fake continent into space.  While, Herculean it felt like a paucity of superness.  Synder's Superman has ample opportunity to show super ability.  I also like that this superman is ""year one"" and has yet to mature and master is powers.  I'm looking forward to seeing that superman."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Not a traditional depiction of this classic. Yet spin and liberties make it a worth wild summer movie. It is a little overboard on the action giving the audience a sensory overload. 

Would not recommend they make a sequel, but knowing the Hollywood Executives they will and it will more than likely fail."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,6/16/2013 Mr. Snyder ushers in the end of the serious superhero movies.  Exhausting and no fun.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,the action and acting was amazing. a must see movie.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"As a HUGE superman fan I had very high hopes for this movie. While I wasn't blown away, I was not disappointed."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"As a lifelong fan, this is the movie I have been waiting for. The settings, the plot, the music, the ethical dilemmas and resolutions, the strength of character are all there. The acting is solid throughout. While there were one or two plot points that were confusing, they weren't enough for me to detract by even one star."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"I am almost always in line with the critics on movies. This time, they are just wrong. I read the reviews saying ""Man of Steel"" has no humor or fun factor. I agree. This time, they take the Superman story seriously, and it is dark, gritty, very sci-fi, and feels like the kind of reboot the film makers failed to do 8 years or so ago. 

Super hero movies are changing. They are being taken more seriously, and the characters are becoming real, flawed, and human (even when they are not). DC has only been able to do this with the Nolan-era Batman franchise until now. 

Man of Steel is not just DC's answer to the 2013 summer blockbusters like Iron Man 3 and Star Trek, it feels like a direct response to the Avengers and the beginning of something great for us, the fans.

I am happily going against the critics and recommending ""Man of Steel"" with flying colors. It is a bit dark for the young kids and doesn't have the humor of the old ones at all. This is a high budget action drama similar to the recent Batman films. 

Go see it in the theater. I opted not to see it in 3D. I'm still ok with that decision. I would have rated the movie higher if the resolution of the story was a little less rushed and muddy.  I feel like lots was cut to fit it into a lengthy, but satisfying 2.5 hours.

Bring it on Marvel, DC has some ammo in their cannons."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome movie I don't know what the critics are hating it for amazing u can see the dark like dark knight amazing can't wait for the next one good job Zack and Christopher
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,intense blood rushing extraordinary! only fault is that it didn't follow the original story line! but still good
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, loved everything, only flaw i found was that Lois Lane's romance was forced but other than that it was awesome, saw it twice already!"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Don't anyone in their right mind believe from any critic, website, or person for one second that ""man of steel"" is somewhat a good movie, or that it's just ""ok"". The truth is that it is one of the best ground breaking, and just magnificent superhero movie since the first superman movie starring Christopher reeves! Not only is it the perfect dc/hero movie, it's just an awesome movie in general for audiences who aren't really big DC or superman fans. It really has everything that you wish to see in a movie, great effects, great stunts, heart felt moments, action packed, funny moments,top of the notch acting, with an awesome list of incredible actors! Character development was not really an issue for some since we all kinda seen that many times from past superman movies, but even for first tuners, it's really easy to grasp the essence of all of them, whether it a person who is from another planet, confused and never really fit anywhere in the world(superman) or from a hard working journalist who is very passionate at her stories(Lois Lane). I recommend this movie for anyone and everyone! Man of steel has marked a giant milestone for theatrical success and has certainly raised the bar for all of the superhero movies to come."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great movie but do not take young children.
Very intense and graphic!"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"BOO to all of the nay sayers!  I say CHECK IT OUT!  It has action.  It has some humor.  It has great actors who actually fit their parts.  I will always love Christopher Reeves and his first 2 movies, but this is for a new generation and I feel it delivers!"
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,Very entertaining but a bit long on the crashing Into building after building after building in the fight scenes at the end of the movie.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"For being a superhero movie, its a very well done superhero movie of immense proportions and stunning visuals. Plot was not too simplistic, and added to the movie rather than leaving the visuals take over completely."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of steel leaves you with the feeling of going to an awesome rock concert despite it's minor flaws. The bottom line is, this is a realistic tale of what it would be like if superman existed during our time. Now, critics will tell you that this is not superman... but it is. Let's face it, we can't rewind the clocks back to when it was Christopher Reeves at the helm. We can only look forward to the future, and that future is Henry Cavill. I went into this movie knowing full well what to expect, and regardless of what critics have said, I found this movie to be quite entertaining. Where rumors have led this movie to portray a more serious version of superman, though true, the man of steel does provide moments for laughter. As for the plot, we all know the story. This is an origin movie of superman that goes into deeper territory that we all have yet to experience. We now get a deeper look at krypton and understand the motives of each character in this movie. That being said, the movie in its own way does take off at a speed of it's own. Kal-El is born, Zod faces his people to save his race, and Jor-El ensures his son's safe departure to earth. Only soon after we are sent 33 years into the future where Clark is now a man reflecting on his past. Man of steel uses a flashback way of story telling to move and connect the plot towards Clark's journey in finding out who he really is. This being one of the most criticized parts of the movie is understandable, but it at least gives us something new. We now have a more in depth look at who superman is. While having it's moments of passion, dialogue can be bland at times. One thing is for sure, the movie stands alone as one of the most action packed and visually stunning movies you will ever see. Almost too action packed. However, the man of steel finds a way to balance it's somewhat clunky plot and ongoing action with just the right touches. In the end, the man of steel leaves us wanting more, but a movie that covers oh so much can only give us a brief picture of what superman can be: a sign of hope. Let's face it, we can't all be saved. Especially when 2 gods have to settle their differences for the fate of the human race...on earth that is. 4 out of 5 stars."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,I very much liked this take on Superman.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie made up for the last Super Man and gave a whole new meaning to DC Comics
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"If you've never seen superman or herd about him or read any comic book or seen any movie this will be tolerable... If you are a superman fan at all you will want to pluck the directors eyelids out With a Shovel!!! 
    The best way to describe this movie is aliens Crossed with Star Wars, How to Train My Pet Dragon, Space Ball's, War of The Worlds.... With a man flying around with ....
   The lead of Superman was well cast, Lois Lane was okay, Superman's fathers were Both great actors, it is just a shame that everything else could not have been worse....!!! The whole movie was space ships, aliens and Star Wars type fighting... It was everything except for Superman! And again our hero gets beat up for most of the movie.... For Four which about 37 minutes of the movie was him getting pushed through the cement over and over and over and over again nothing creative or different.... The people that put this trash together should be arrested at best!!!"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie!  Finally a Superman we have been waiting for!
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,Far from the original...Superman.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Visually unattractive and mediocrely directed, ""Man of Steel"" hangs between its poor narrative and boredom. Maybe it's the bad writing or the lack of thrill, but this Superman never takes off. 
And no, the 3D doesn't help."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,Painfully boring to sit through.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"No point in writing my own review when this guy's review is so SPOT ON:

http://www.imdb.com/user/ur13518369/"
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"""Man of Steel"" has wiped the aweful Brandon Routh/Bryan Singer Superman from my memory but in my heart the only Superman will always be the late 1970's/early 80's Christopher Reeve films. ""Man of Steel"" is a decent reboot. Told mostly in flashbacks begining on his homeworld and then glancing back occassionally on Clark Kent's Kanas childhood. Overly long and long on things blowing up and short on heart and humour."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,I'm thinking this is a good start to a fine trilogy but on its own it fall a little short.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"A movie mainly designed to re-introduce the man of steel.  A lot of action and a bit too much jumping around in time throughout the movie but, a very well done film.

Great film!"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Easily the best movie of the year.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"After years of wishing they would make a Superman movie where they gave him 'something to HIT' they finally did so and I found myself bored with the experience.

A real shame.  The action scenes taken individually stand as some of the best live action representations of what super powered hand to hand combat might look and feel like.

But these scenes were too long, too stacked one on top of another and ultimately pretty boring and tedious because the work of establishing these characters and giving the audience a reason to care about them was not done by the writers/director of the film.

The opening sequence on Krypton was new and somewhat cool.  But like most of the rest of the movie ran too long for no good reason other than its own cool-ness.

The movie really had a chance to be GREAT.  The scenes of young Clark growing up in Kansas and the performances of Diane Lane and Kevin Costner (as well as the young men playing young Clark) really gave the audience a connection with the characters.

But once the ghost of Jor-El gives his son the Superman suit and Clark instantly accepts his role, shaves and styles his hair to fully look the part (?), it is all downhill.

Michael Shannon over-acts as Zod.  No choice but to compare him to Terence Stamp's amazing and timeless performance in the otherwise dated Donner films.  

Henry Cavill looks enough of the part but he didn't inhabit the role.  He and everyone else seemed embarassed to be there;  always a problem that brings down the worst superhero/comic book adaptions.

Maybe that wouldn't have been so obvious if the writing had given them more to work with but overall this was lackluster and disappointing despite having more action than any Superman movie (and maybe any other superhero movie).

Some trilogies start slow and hit their high point in the first sequel.  Perhaps this will be the case here.  But with so many glaring flaws it is hard to imagine this same creative team will really bring much more to the table.

For the record, I am a lifelong comic book reader and Superman was the first superhero I enjoyed as a kid (though the comics were never really very good as it is so hard to present a challenge worthy to his power level;  the best Superman stories thus were the ones that demonstrated that despite his godlike standing among the humans of Earth he was among the most human of us all thanks to the values he was brought up with in Kansas...maybe the makers of this film should go back and read some of those stories).

The Donner films are trapped in their age.  They were perfect for the time but as Singer and company learned we do need a modern Superman.  

But there has to be the middle ground.  As some reviewers note the last 30 minutes of the movie felt like a Transformers movie with non-stop explosions and a human death toll that we never saw and never cared about.

Very disappointing.  When I saw the bad reviews coming out I was hoping I would reject them but I'm forced to mostly agree.

This is mostly what I feared when I first heard that the WB execs were bringing in Nolan to make a darker Superman.  This is what I feared even more when Zack Snyder was brought in to direct (make no mistake:  this looks more like Superman than any other when he is doing super-things;  it just doesn't feel like the character at all)."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Solid re-do of Superman after the last disappointing outing that is filled with amazing special effects, a great cast, and it felt epic! Unfortunately it's not the colossal success I was hoping for with redundant fight sequences, Michael Bay-style action scenes where you can't even see what's happening, and an unnecessarily long runtime. It is a straight-up summer blockbuster, but it's a step in the right direction and here's to hoping that the next entry calms down a bit and delivers ALL the goods."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A loud, action-packed summer thriller with all the twists and turns in all the places you've come to expect. With Zak Snyder as director, expect a nearly continuous sequence of big-budget, CGI-laden disaster scenes. Beautiful special and digital effects, however, don't make up for the lackluster story that is well short on surprises. A fun flick to pass a few hours with, but don't expect to be blown away."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This movie, though uniquely groundbreaking in some respects, strayed a little too far from the origins of my favorite super hero for my tastes. I miss the fortress of solitude, keeping Lois Lane in the dark about who Superman is for her safety by Clark Kent, Jonathan Kent passing away of a heart attack, solid dialog.. There was so much FX in the film, explosions, destruction of multiple parts of the earth the characters seemed to get lost."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,The best Superman movie by far. Man of Steel is the first Superman movie to get the character right. No goofy fluff or unnecessary secret identity hide and seek.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome!  Love this new installment.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Best superman movie of ALL TIME!  An adult film which captures the magesty of the 
Superman legend without cliche.     Leave the film with this director, producer and cast and the franchise is in excellent health for the forseeable future."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The makers of this film do get one thing correct, and that is the epic spectacle that is Superman. The action in this movie are at some points jaw-dropping. I found myself constantly being pulled in to the screen when I was seeing Superman smack around the bad guys. As a fan of action films, I was thoroughly satisfied with this film.

Now there is not much here in terms of plot, but I could let that go since I went into this hoping to just have a good time. In the film General Zod wants to take over earth in order to bring back the fallen Kryptonian race. When this starts to go down Superman must rise to the occasion and stop them. Michael Shannon does a fine job of playing General Zod, occasionally making his performance a bit campy but it works. Henry Canvill is a little stale here as Superman, but when you see him standing there in his suit you totally believe that he is Superman. Amy Adams does a great job here as Lois Lane. I do however think that Lawrence Fishburne was wasted in this film. If you have someone of his caliber in this film, then have him doing something other than running around while the city falls apart. The rest of the supporting cast does ok as well.

My biggest problem with the movie, was the scenes in between all the action. They are dull. I found the constant flashbacks to Superman's time in Smallville so distracting. I was taken right out of the film every time it happened. I never found Clark Kent's story all that interesting, and this film sure as hell did not help it. But besides these shortcomings the movie does succeed as a summer blockbuster. So yeah...not bad.

Also that rousing score every time Superman went into battle was really, really, really good."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I was never a Superman fan, but I really appreciated the little touches of humanity this looong remake/reboot brought. I think the critics are being too harsh on the story, which has its base in some of the older comic's story arcs. They want a silly and campy 1970's/1980's Superman, but that would not fit with the gritty ""Dark Knight world"" Superman now lives in. I'm not kidding when I say this movie felt long (just like the Dark Knight Returns), and it had so many blur-zoom effects that I felt like I was in the middle of a Clone Wars battle, but I think this was a very good DC movie."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,very good superman movie!!! loved it
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Best Superman movie to date.  Love how it played out.  It's tough to make this character interesting and this movie managed to do so.  It was also evident it was made in a manner to set up further story lines both with this character (Luthor, Braniac, possibly even a Doomsday angle) and other DC characters (especially Batman but also Wonder Woman)."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,movie was good from start to finish.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,It was all special effects and action. I would have liked to seen more character building. It was disappointing.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Fantastic reboot. So many great themes. We spent days dissecting different scenes. A bit slow during the fight scenes but the rest of the story picks it back up.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,This is about the fight between Superman and Zod. Nothing else. No real story. It went on a lttle long.  Saw it in 3D. No big difference. Christopher Reeves and Smallville Superman much better. Did not enjoy seeing tall buildings fall down.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"I don't know why the critics hated this movie? This movie is a great return of the greatest superhero of all time. The action were over the top amazing and realistic, the cast was great especially Russel Crowe and Michael S as zod which made Zod an great villain since bane from dark knight rises. The story was well-told with strong developed characters. The soundtrack blended perfectly in the action. In the final verdict of The Man of Steel deceives an 9 out of 10."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"The way superman should have always been, more human."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,Exhausting.  I did like the extensive back story. Lois Lane is now her own super hero.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie was awesome!!!
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"strong, awesome scifi action packed super hero movie!! action is at a scale of avengers and as grounded as the dark knight that only superman could do!!"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel speaks for itself. The numbers and audience ratings lead to one conclusion. That this movie is outstanding and that leaves us scratching our heads at the low rating that a small minority of ""critics"" give to Man of Steel. Clearly, they are woefully wrong and thus there are no debates on landslides. Whatever imperfections anyone spots will be quickly forgotten in just about 8 seconds... Go see this blockbuster, it rocks!"
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Boom, boom, bam, superman sucks."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Spoiler-free

Best Superman Film so far! PERIOD.

Pros:

-They made me feel for the Superman character, as opposed to me not caring about him much going into the film. They changed my perspective on him. That SH!% impressed me!

-They made Superman meek not weak in this film. The ending with Zod defines that side of Supes well.

-They accomplished what they set out to do! Base Clark in the real world. Some may mention the movie having pseudo-science plot holes/ flaws, but if you read the comics they are perfectly justifiable.

Cons:

My only gripe is the script needed some work on the levity-and-witty aspects, but no script is perfect. 
Expected this thanks to the other spoiler-free reviews and it was also one of my concerns along w/ many others going into the film.

Overall the script was well-structured, no doubt, thanks to Chris Nolan. But I give thanks to Goyer, Snyder, the admirable cast and crew for bringing it together.
8/10* and being considered for one of my favorite superhero origin stories brought to film after Batman Begins and Iron Man, respectively.

Bring on the sequel and DC Studios' DCCU!!!"
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,As superman movies go this was one of the best.  The problem it is hard to make an invulnerable man vulnerbale.  I did not like the actor cast as Zod.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Incredible movie. 10/10
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"I loved it, it was a grown up take on superman with a thorough backstory that makes sense in the context of the universe. The villain was perfect, and made logical sense. The story was perfect."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Seriously screw the critics, to me this is one of the best movies of 2013 I may even go as far as saying its THE best movie of 2013. It has one of the best movie opening I've ever seen and really gives you a great feel of superman's origins. This movie topped any expectations I had And honestly have nothing bad to say about the movie, great action, great story 5 of 5"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,it was awesome I would literally watch it again
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"As an origin story intended to introduce a DC universe much like Iron Man did for Marvel, there's a lot to like about Man of Steel.  We finally see a modern day effects Superman use his full strength and in that regard it's pretty breathtaking although it eventually devolves into a city-wide MMA match.    The film does a fantastic job introducing Superman and how his Earthling and Kryptonian father informs his character and his decision-making.  Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe's performances aren't mere cameos but are fully fleshed out and loom large throughout most of the movie.  A few primary Superman characters, Lois Lane and Perry White, are short-changed in this film but are featured enough to well-establish their characters for future films.  I actually ended up not minding their small parts so much, although I wish Cavill and Adams had more chemistry together.   What this movie ultimately misses out on is humor.  Even The Dark Knight had levity and the fact that Man of Steel doesn't, until its closing moments, is what prevents from being a great film.  That said, it's still better than any of the films in the Marvel universe, the Avengers included.  You can tell that DC cares a lot about the quality of the final product and doesn't just cobble a bunch of random elements together so they can serve their bottom line in future installments.  I'm really looking forward to see where Bruce Wayne/Batman and maybe eventually the Justice League can fit in this universe."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Second best movie I have seen this summer.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"So, I really don't care about Superman. 

That isn't to say that I don't enjoy movies about him, or that I didn't watch the heck out of Smallville (for five seasons, anyway). I just have no particular attachment to the character or his backstory that would leave me frothing with rage about any changes that a reboot like this movie may make. Therefore, the criticisms that compare this movie to the old classic Superman unfavorably just make me shrug. I read several critical pieces which called the movie ""joyless,"" which I'm not sure I understand. If by ""joyless"" they meant ""devoid of cheesy one-liners and really bad special effects and a jaunty soundtrack"" then... okay, I guess. But I have to say I find plenty of joy in the type of selfless love that is upheld as an ideal in the latest Superman reboot.

I had two critical pieces of advice for the movie-makers upon leaving the theater: less pointless action, and write a better script. The dialogue suffers especially in comparison to its fellow summer blockbusters Iron Man 3 and even Star Trek: Into Darkness. I give Man of Steel a solid B+."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"The movie was great , I really enjoyed it."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,2 1/2 hours of my life I'll never get back. Totally changed the story of superman. Epic Fail.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This movie has moments of greatness, and is at times very entertaining. But the film has the wrong tone for the character of Superman, it seems to rip off other (better) science
fiction films, and the action scenes (while starting out fun) go on for too long and almost become too explosive to enjoy. Still worth a rent."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Un buen ""renacer"" al cine para Superman, con bastante acci√≥n y excelentes efectos especiales, pero con algo claro, nunca ser√° mejor que Batman!"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,no need for character development for a character we all know so well. americas greatest superhero is back. even if he's being played by a brit.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This was an action packed extravaganza, but thats pretty much were it ends two and half hours seemed drown out"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,I don't understand all the indifference to this movie. It was an amazing spectacle of a movie. We asked for more action in a Superman film and we got it. I loved the hell out of this movie. 58% it should be 158%!
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"good restart to the franchise. like all 1st in a series this one sets the backstory so it spends its time setting up characters for those who didn't grow up reading superman comics or watching the campy Tv series.
the second in this series should rock (kinda like the 2nd batman with heath ledger). a good strong start. skip the 3d though√¢?¬¶it really doesn't add anything to the movie...except to the bottom line."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie yet!!! Def must see!!
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,the story line is crap...
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Many will compare it to Nolans Batman Trilogy which is a mistake... Compare it to Batman Begins...the Movie is solid. It goes back to the origins Template but has Snyders unique style matched with Nolan-esque paced story telling to really bring Superman to a current incarnation that works better than previous tries. Most who would realistically compare Man of Steel to Batman Begins would see a great begining to a franchise that could really be super.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,I think Man Of Steel is a step in the right direction for the DC Universe... having said that there is still ways to go. I found unable to enjoyed the movie fully.  I stilled enjoyed MOS enough to give it three and a half stars...
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,The movie's character actions were absurd and did'nt make sense. Why was Lois asked to come along with superman in the superman surrender scene? The Dad was killed by his need to save his damn dog and from him refusing the help of his son. This doesn't male sense because he would have been alive if not for that.The combat was repetitive. General Zod wanted to save his planet while politicians just sat and did nothing to save their dying race. Overall stupid.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"A fantastic special effects bonanza action movie with a liberal dusting of humanity, if you walk out of this movie unhappy you probably intended to from the start. The problem I've always had with superman, in comics and movies, is that he's such an insufferable goody two shoes. It makes it hard to connect with the protagonist in any meaningful way, but Man of Steel? Much better. Superman is finally, for lack of a better word, human. If you don't understand by the last major action sequence of the film then you never will. 

Is it a perfect movie? Of course not. Are there minor holes in the plot? Yes, but honestly they're smaller than most in movies detailing an alien who grew up on Earth that can fly and bench press tractor trailers. Go watch the movie, Citizen Cain it is not, Superman, it is!"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Great Movie. I loved it!
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Critics are asleep at the wheel on this one. It's an incredible movie, especially if you're a Superman fan. I see a lot of smear going on with this one, and it's ugly. Plain and simple."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,A thrilling adventure with a solid emotional core.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Best super hero movie! Best story line
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,The BEST Superman movie.......EVER!
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"The first thing people going to see this should know is that this is more of a SciFi movie than a superhero one. For those who know the various stories of Kal El over the years, this is the best version ever brought to screen. Superman is a tragic character at his core. He's not a mom and apple pie, well adjusted mid 30's superhero. He's alone. He's the outsider trying to fit in, but knows deep down that he never will despite falling for a human. This movie captured his decision to use his great power to help and protect wonderfully. Those going in to watch it expecting something campy will most likely rate this poorly like the film critics who know nothing of the comic character. Snyder's visuals were top notch. And with Nolan on board to make it grounded in more reality, it was just that. It wasn't the campy, albeit, fun Reeves version. It was an up to date realistic take on the lonely hero, in the same way Nolan showed Bruce Wayne to be the mask that the focused sociopathic Batman wears. While this may not be as perfect of a superhero movie that the Avengers was, but not many will ever be that."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,A slightly decent action movie. Too rowdy.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"When I went to see Man Of Steel, I was very excited and intrigued. When I saw that Christopher Nolan was involved with this movie, that's when I made the decision to go see it. Uunforunately, Man Of Steel didn't deliver the intensity I expected. With it's fast and very powerful action and a score that gave me chills the first time I heard it in the trailer, Man Of Steel is unable to bring that same intensity when it comes to characterization. One thing I noticed about this movie was that when the characters had to be dramatic, the seriousness didn't really stick and it was kind of akward. Also, the way Superman killed the General was kind of a buzzkill. Although, with it's flaws, Man Of Steel was able to entertain me at a good amount, and is definetly worth wacthing a second time."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Go see the movie and see if you don't enjoy it! All of these critics don't know what they are talking about.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Amazing Movie!!! Loved it!!
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,liked the story a lot. yet another serious super hero movie without all the childish humor .....loved it!!! everyone will forget the super man returns movie made awhile ago for sure.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great Superman movie!!!!  The best of the bunch!  I miss Chris Reeve but Cavill played an awesome Kal-El.  I do not understand the critics saying the movie was bad, especially that one complaining that there was ""too much action"".  The action sequences were filmed with such a neat and creative angle, something I've never seen before.  A great, new take on the origin story!!  Super-movie! (pun intended)"
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A strong, well made movie.  Wasn't everything I thought it would be, but very entertaining.  Seemed longer then it needed to be and was crazy violent.  guy that played Superman was the best one ever.  Looking forward to see where they take this story line."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,AWSOMEEE EPICCC SOOOOOOO SEEING IT AGAIN>> AND HENRY! OMGGGG AM GONNA DREAM ABOUT THIS MAN FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE LOL
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"It has a solid story, heartfelt moments and LOTS of action. However, I see why critics attacked it. This is not the 1978 Superman and it makes absolutely no homage to C. Reeves. So, anyone expecting that remake; would be disappointed. This also isn't the fun-in-the-sun cherry Superman with lots of laughs. It is an alien sci-fi movie using Superman as a backdrop. I liked the new structure. It needed this and I'm waiting to see what they do with the next 2 films of the trilogy."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Much better than I expected. Despite being a dialog-lite script, I cared about the characters. It was a fast 2.75 hours as well."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Even though Man of Steel was action packed and had great visuals, it suffers from plot holes and poor story progression. The beginning felt rushed, and the end felt drawn out. Some of the characters roles even seem a bit off. Superman's character also feels very one sided and not very dynamic."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Superman doesn't get any better than this. A modern, realistic take that lays the foundation for the DC cinematic universe perfectly!"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,epic the best superman movie ever
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Amazing! By far the greatest Superman film thus far.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Saw it today. Loved the movie, don't listen to the ""critics""!"
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,A solid film with a different but interesting take on the idea of Superman that is a little more grounded in reality.  A much better outing that the failed Superman Returns even though RT gave it a 75% for some reason.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,Too many liberties from the original... Bummer was so looking forward to this
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,It strayed too much from the original plot and the violence was over the top.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie good action
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,im over superheroes i guess
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Awesome, action packed movie!!!!"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,best fathers day movie ever!
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,It was made for the younger crowd. There was a little too much fighting and not enough storyline. The movie had a dark overcast to it.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie for people of all ages!!
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is by far the best interpretation of Superman to date.  Roeper and Poland have 0 clue as to the basis model of a great movie.  These two ""critics"" use their reviews to make money.  They can't be objective because they owe their loyalties to artsy/subjective films.  Now, for Man of Steel review.  If realism is what your looking for with character depth, look no further.  This film was written with beautiful orchestration by David Goyer, and directed perfectly by Snyder.  Each act of MOS serves as a building block for Superman.  The emotional journey we go on coincides with the decision making process of a man with incredible power and a conscience to match.  The epic structure will make forget Donners Superman, and get behind the personal Man Of Steel we've been searching for.  A must see for all!"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Not bad. Was worried that it would be cheesy but it kept my interest and the kids thoroughly loved it.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,I liked it. Felt it could a been really good  if a few scenes were chopped down a bit.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Falling down a flight of stairs is would be preferable to sitting through this plott-free, character-free, ear-splittingly loud special effects meat grinder."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Didn't disappoint me
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The great cast and a new leading man makes this Superman reboot almost passable. A decent first hour is squandered by a messy second half that substitutes story with badly shot endless action scenes that will leave you exhausted rather than excited. The out of order flashbacks only add to an already bland story and this Superman is less a symbol of hope and more a symbol of destruction and mayhem. 

Grade: C+"
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I have immense respect, but also feel incredibly sorry, for Zack Snyder. He is one of my favorite filmmakers and he always manages to take on the most difficult of stories to bring to film and has consistently pulled them off (in my opinion) despite being mercilessly scrutinized by audiences. I would argue that since he takes on previously existing stories that people hold such strong opinions and biases about (such as Watchmen, 300, Dawn of the Dead and Superman) that his films are held to a harsher standard than most and it is hard to find an unbiased critical opinion on them. That being said, perhaps I am biased because I love every single one of his films, I'm not even a Superman fan but if there was one filmmaker who could make me go to the theater for it, Snyder would be on the short list. All in All, I believe Man of Steel is not as good as the rest of his portfolio, but he did succeed in making a decent film about Superman. 
Superman is a difficult story to bring to the screen, as many tries in television and film have proved. I would also argue that it is mostly because there are so many strange aspects to the mythology that it is almost impossible to make a Superman movie that can be taken seriously (an all-American alien who fights crime in a skin-tight suit and a cape that can mask his identity behind glasses?). This latest effort however is grounded, entertaining, eye-catching, and keeps the incredulousness to a bare minimum. Cavill as the hero works fine, he had enough charm, ruggedness, and even a little brooding. Zod was an excellent villain choice with great evil zeal and Shannon was as excellent as I hoped he would be, as well as the equally badass Faora.  Lois Lane wasn't as helpless as you think she might be, and Adams was not as girly or frail as I had feared. Both sets of parental figures were also very strong.  There was enough back story, a large chunk of action, and a hard-fought climax. My only complaints are that there was one huge fight scene too many, it felt like it needed just a hint more of character development, and I don't think I've been bashed over the head so hard with product placement in a film before. People are most likely going to compare this film to a lot of things, the top two being The Dark Knight trilogy and the previous Superman films and this is a hit-and-miss. Is it better than the previous Superman films? Most definitely. Is it better than The Dark Knight trilogy? Not a chance, but few films are, so it's an unfair comparison.  This is not a perfect movie, this was never going to be a perfect movie, but it's very decent and we should all be happy that this is what we were given because it's extremely doubtful it could have been better than this and we could have all been stuck with Superman Returns as the final word on the matter. Just go see it, you know you're going to eventually."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of steel is an awesome movie, it gave a great origin story about Clark Kent that we haven't really seen much in past Superman renditions, and there is plenty of awesome action in this movie that Superman returns didn't have!"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,great lead in for a reboot.  I enjoyed it!  can't wait to see if they would ever do a superman and batman movie!
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Great film. I will see this again.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie and everything about it made the fangirl in me cheer for joy! Henry was AMAZING in this role and everyone just brought their A Game and gave me goosebumps. If they are all like this I'd love several more just like it, Thank you Mr.Cavill for saying yes and to Zack Snyder for doing it right! I loved loved loved this movie!"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Kinda stumbled a bit on whether to give this film 3 or 4 stars out of 5. I've gone with the latter; the main reason being that, despite its noticeable plotholes, the dragging of the story in the second act, and the silliness of its action sequences in the third, dammit this movie was FUN! The epitome of a true popcorn blockbuster spectacle - and that's just a regular screening. Seeing it in IMAX made it a lot grander, and an even bigger marvel to behold (3D was so-so, though). If you're just  looking for a great time at the movies, then I have to recommend it on that alone - you will surely not be disappointed."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,VERY good....extremely long but great movie!   completely different from prior superman movies!!!
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This was an entertaining movie, just not the brilliant epic masterpiece that many was expecting, especially after the amazing trailer at the start of the year, the pacing was a bit slow for my liking, it didn't really pick up till the last hour, but the fight scenes were incredible, still, I was expecting better, hopefully the inevitable sequel will right some wrongs"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Was a great movie.  All you need is minimal knowledge of Superman to enjoy it, as they give you a new origin story to observe and take in.  Things you need to remember is this is a movie adaptation and it should not be related to the comic stories; it's their on interpretation of a comic hero.  The fight scenes were done really well, for how powerful the combatants were.  A few hiccups, but like I said it's powerful beings and you can't expect some things not to happen."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I give the movie a passing grade. It wasn't the great masterpiece everyone was hoping, it has too much shaky cam and the pacing was a bit reckless. However, it gave the franchise a much needed change. This is a Superman that Superman Returns should have been. Overall, it was entertaining and made me care for Superman and his family, both on Earth and in Krypton."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie kicks ass
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"I am really surprised at all of the bad reviews.

This is my first review, and I'm posting this only because critics aren't doing it justice. While it was not as good as the Dark Knight trilogy, it was still a great movie. It surpasses all of the previous Superman movies, blowing the most recent series out of the park. It balances action and storyline beautifully, as Batman Begins does.

Do yourself a favor and go see this movie."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved it, superman will always live on.!!!!!"
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,Amazing special effects and Cavill does a stellar job. However...what was up with the cliche/corny lines in certain parts of the movie? This film could have been epic (like Batman with Bale)...but I lost count of the number of times I found myself silently groaning and wanting to curse whoever was in charge of character's lines...it ruined a good movie and I walked out feeling irked and disappointed.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"There's a lot of joy in seeing a Superman movie that does justice to the dynamism of the character, and shows a man stepping into the light, and using his abilities to the fullest."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Looks like audience vs. critics on this one. I am going to go see it again! Loved it.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Wow, I know it will be tough for people, but a change had to come-could have had lil more romance, but I'm very happy with man of steel. They had to cram a lot in and the action was wild. Love the way Nolan and Goyer put that darker spin on things. Shannon was alittle funny sounding at first and got darker as time went on. Cavill looked great and nice even ground for men and women among the dying age of macho men. Mrs. Traue was a beast sexy and strong. Can't wait for the next one-everyone else did a wonderful job."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"My review of ""Man of Steel"" 
*NO major spoilers

I will start by saying I am biased towards the character of Superman. Which could be a bad thing considering I'm sort of a purest when it comes to the character of Kal-El/Clark Kent. With that said, this was one of the BEST movies I have EVER seen in a theater. Sure, there were major changes to the character of Superman but they were good and much needed changes. And yes, I had my share of complaints which we will look at this towards the end.

""Man of Steel"" was directed by Zack Snyder and it was superb. The movie starts off with Clark grown and uses flashbacks to tell what was needed for THIS particular story. He created a flashback scenario that would lend very nicely to continuing them in the following films.

It was written by Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer who were the team that brought us the Batman Trilogy. So, in other words, it tends to be much darker and more real life than the previous 5 Superman films. But then again, we are talking about an alien with superhuman strength with no weaknesses (other than Kryptonite). Well... as real as that whole story can be. 

The acting was top notch. Henry Cavill brought a much more solemn take to Superman than we are used to, but it was what this story needed. Not to say we don't see glimpses of the Superman we know and love but he hasn't yet embraced that side of himself yet. Amy Adams take on Lois was a breathe of fresh air. She brought a tenacity in real life situations that her character needed desperately. Gone are the days of Lois screaming ""You've got me? Who's got you?"" Russell Crowe was powerful as Jor-El the father of Kal-El/Clark bringing strong dialog and acting to the role as he always does. But the standout actor was, without a doubt, Kevin Costner as Pa Kent. Almost every scene he was in was emotionally moving. AND his final scene will bring on the tears.

Unfortunately I have seen so many critics with negative reviews. I don't get it. I ask myself what were the critics smoking while watching it.  The only thing I can see is that Superman's origin story is changed in this film. I won't say how but it is significant. BUT the changes which were made are good and much needed. Sure we love the originals but it has been 70 years since the creation of the character and certain things don't work now. I honestly felt that Zack Snyder (Director) and Chris Nolan (Writer/Producer) made so many brilliant moves in creating this movie. I don't take lightly saying that IT IS not only the BEST 'Superman' movie to date but quite possibly the best superhero movie ever. 

I have heard some complaints such as ""It was to over the top"" and ""There was no character development."" I just don't understand that at all. As far as being over the top... Superman has ALWAYS been over the top. That is simply who he is in the comics and the cartoons. And as far as the character development goes. This movie gave more character development than all 5 previous movies combined. For the first time we saw Jor-El for a length of time and heard his story. We saw 30min of Krypton and its inhabitants. We saw General Zod developed which has never been done in this fashion. Not the mention we followed Lois Lane through her discovery and watched her character change throughout the movie as well as she became apart of the story of Superman rather than a damsel in distress as she has always been. AND Kal-El/Clark Kent... his character has NEVER been more fleshed out. They created a character that was both understandable and compelling. AND people keep forgetting that this is the first Superman movie in this storyline. So, obviously Clark doesn't become Superman until the end of the movie. So the Superman we know and love will be seen much more in the following films. This movie is his origin story. 

Thats not to say that the movie was without its flaws. I felt that some of the visual effects were so overpowering that you lost the characters and the story a bit. The sound at times was incredible loud drowning out what you were watching. The beautiful composed soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, though moving, was a bit loud at parts. It felt as if Zack Snyder was intentionally trying to force you to be emotionally charged from the music. 

As far as the question ""Should I take my kids to see it?"" I will say there are quite a few intensely violent scenes as well as some language. No bad scenes other than a lingering kiss between Lois and Clark. I would place it as equivalent to the Batman films as far bad content (language/innuendo). For a overview of the content I will refer you to www.pluggedin.com/movies/intheaters/man-of-steel.aspx.

But with that, I will say, it was the most exhilarating movie I have possibly ever seen. Oh yeah, and I'm going to see it again on Thursday and will most likely enjoy watching it more the second time. Yes, I'm a nerd. 

I hope you enjoy it also."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Nolan and Snyder have made an interesting and different film especially within the super hero genre. Its pacing and rhythm is very unique, with its self contained and rounded story working for superman who does not come across as just a generic super hero. Krypton is amazing, with some of the best designs on film for a very long time. The cast are great with Cavill, Adams and everyone else really becoming the characters. Earth is portrayed in a very inspired, galactic way, which makes superman all the more believable and respectable. The story and weight of all these characters and their threats are really huge with the film pulling it off well, while the flashbacks can some times be distracting they are also quite original. Overall this certainly is a film to admire and be wowed by, but its different tone and set up may prove it less enjoyable for some."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Lots of VFX, not a ton of dialogue. Some good, some not so good. Decent but not spectacular."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,I felt like I was watching a bad SciFi movie that occasionally had a cameo from Superman. failed attempt at revamping Superman and starting a new DC Universe
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,I love this movie!! Warning you will cry
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie! It moves a bit fast in the beginning, but overall amazing superman movie! Best superman movie yet!"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"'Man Of steel' is a Superman movie unlike any seen before, I fully expect there will be a tremendous amount of dislike for the film (during the first ten minutes a couple walked out of our viewing I must note) but I largely put this down to the misunderstanding of who Superman is more than anything, he is an alien and always has been, not a super 'man', which for the first time is fully fleshed out in the Superman cinematic universe to Snyder's credit. I think the best way to appreciate the film would be as someone familiar with Superman's comic origins, someone not familiar with any version of Superman, or simply be of the attitude to take on the film on it's own standing without any preconceived ideas.

I think because this alien origin plays a key part in the film that it's fair to discuss this a bit more, many people are probably less familiar with this Krypton heavy version of Superman having been brought up on the Superman films of the past, which only dip their toes briefly into the alien aspect of Superman. Snyder explains the alien origins excellently in a fully living and breathing Krypton that includes creatures, architecture and ideology. Most of Superman's powers are explored in a practical manner, whether it's the earth having weaker gravity enabling Superman to fly and have a greater amount of strength or Kal-El (Superman's birth name) adapting to Earth's environment, be it air quality or attack on the senses.

I've found a lot of the build up to the film has unfairly dumped the negatives of the early snippets of the movie at Snyder's door while giving the praise and positives to Nolan. If you know anything about Zack Snyder's films you will find it hard after watching this movie to call it anything other than Snyder's vision, it has his visual eye everywhere, some of the shots in the film are so artsy they would not look out of place in a Terrence Malick directed film.

There are some scenes in the film that reminded me of Snyder's previous work of 'Sucker Punch', 'Watchmen' and '300' this was not a bad thing as he was using what had worked well previously to good effect. 

What 'Man Of Steel' is more than anything is incredibly brave and daring, this is a Superman film where large amounts of people die  and aren't saved, we are talking perhaps thousands die, at no point do you feel the characters around Superman are safe, which is a refreshing and engaging approach to a superhero movie. One immensely brave decision for a big budget blockbuster film was to tell Clark's back story in a nonlinear fashion, something that isn't exactly common in films of this size, I for one found this refreshing and executed really well, although those unfamiliar with this method of storytelling I can imagine could perhaps take issue with it, due to unfamiliarity.

The acting is excellent for this genre of film, Kevin Costner plays a believable Jonathan Kent that really anchors the development of Clark, which in turn makes you really understand Superman's motives, beliefs and desire to protect earth. Russell Crowe is also another actor that is on top form for 'Man Of Steel' as Jor-El who really conveys his wishes for his son to become something more, a symbol of hope.

Henry Cavill does a credible job as the man in the red cape, his performance is subtle and believable, Clark isn't just a goody two-shoes, sometimes it is evident he wishes to react, but has had to control his feelings and be the better person. While Cavill's performance is a subtle one, I think it's perfect as a platform to really develop the character and explore more in the sequel which is hinted towards the end, we may see more of Clark at the daily planet.

Zack Snyder shows his masterful ability to direct visually thrilling shots time after time, 'Man Of Steel ' is no different, this time Snyder ditches his often noted Slow-mo and instead brings visual scope and scale to the movie that we haven't seen in a Superman film previously or even his own work. As a last note the 3D work is handled to a great standard and benefits the film, the 3D isn't in your face but definitely adds to the enjoyment and aesthetic of the film.

This was a fantastic and much needed reboot to the Superman movie property, I more than look forward to re-visiting this on blu-ray later in the year"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Great action and plot! A little too scary for kids. A couple of curse words and a birth scene! Kayli thought it was okay.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,Same story with tons of CG and destruction. More time was spent destroying metropolis than building a great story.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Probably the best Superman film to date (though that's not an entirely difficult achievement in my opinion).  Snyder does a great job staying true to the mythos of Superman, yet still makes it his own with plenty of moving character development and great action sequences.

Cavill makes a pretty fantastic Kal-El; he's buff, handsome, and caring.  Adams and Michael Shannon do a good job too, but it sure does make me miss the performance of a good Lex Luthor.  Probably my favorite aspect of the film was Krypton and everything from that world.

Some people will argue it is lacking humor or romance, but I think the serious tone works well for the subject matter.  Although I wouldn't put it above a film like Batman Begins, it's still very enjoyable and satisfying, and will satisfy audiences from every generation."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"The movie was great, except for one thing.  The final action sequence was so long, that I basically zoned out from the endlessness of it all."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"A heavy and dark superhero movie when compared to others. I have a feeling we will be seeing more of this from DC and Warner Bros. going forward to counter Marvel's ever growing universe. Personally, Marvel is still ahead by a mile. Save your money and wait for this to go to Redbox."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"It was a well told story, I enjoyed the movie, expecting more to follow."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great movie. Well done! Pay attention to the end action sequence, contains 2 easter eggs..."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Shows a worthwhile mature version of Superman;Cavill maybe is not like Reeve but it¬¥s a breathtaking rollercoaster of 147 min.Stupendous score by Hank Zimmer.Deserves a chance.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The first few minutes of Man of Steel were interesting, and the last few seconds were charming.  Cavill has possibilities--looks, a certain charm--but the rest of the movie is unnecessarily grim (what's with the color palette??).  This is the basic story--Guy trying to find himself. Zod arrives. Guy finds himself. BOOM, BANG, hit, hit, expLOSION, explosion, crash, band CRASH. Guy saves the world and becomes a reporter. Oh, yes, Lois Lane (Adams) is thrown in occasionally for good measure.  No Jimmy. (WTF?)  I could tolerate the vergining from the original story, but it seemed fairly pointless. Crowe (Jor-El) sleepwalked through his role.  I have really low standards when it comes to SciFi (basically, I'm ok as long as I don't see the wires when they're flying), but there's WAY too much CGI fighting going on and WAY too little storytelling. The charm of the earlier Superman movies is completely gone--well except for those last few seconds.  I'd throw this out and start the new version where this one ends."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Lot of gun blasts, explosions, and actors with crooked bottom teeth.  I've had enough of superhero stories.  Nothing to learn here."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,It was so cool in 3D
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome movie. I loved every second of it.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Absolutely loved it!
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Okay, I've read all the critic reviews of this movie and I have to say I'm surprised.

Firstly, let's take a look at Superman Returns. It received 76% critic and 67% audience rating. Man of Steel is 56% critic and 82% audience. What does that tell you?

Superman Returns (although I thought it was an okay movie myself), didn't have any origin history at all in the movie. It just left off after so many years of his absence. Considering the last Superman movie before it was 1987, nearly 20 years prior, don't you think it should've had an origin if it was an attempt at a reboot? So, if it didn't have one at all and Man of Steel does, why such harsh criticism? Also, I read critic reviews saying how once you get through all the origin bore in the first hour and a half, you finally get some action, then turn around and say there is no character development either. So, what was expected then? Were you expecting Henry Cavill narrate his origins while punching Zod for 2 hours straight? Seriously.

I myself thought the movie was awesome. Sure, some things were done differently and I can understand some fans being a little upset. But, at the same time, I think it put a fresh perspective on the greatest superhero in a new era. It's this generations Superman, and I think he arrived just as he needed to.

The action was beyond belief. It wasn't over the top. No more than Avengers and give the fact these are God's fighting on our planet, what would you expect it to look like? The detail put into the CGI and action sequences was great.

Again, with what I said above, just go see the movie, it's worth it and then some. Given that 82% of the audience feels the same, I would think that means we're on the same page."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,I thought this movie was pretty good. It was slow in certain parts but what movie that's the first of at least a trilogy not? Lol
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,Great Special Effects.... Everything else is horrible... horrible writers... HORRIBLE STORY-LINE
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Don't know what the critics are hunting. I loved it!
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,kudos to the directors in this fresh re-launch of the superman franchise.  The movie gives you more fresh looks at the story and though sometimes feeling a bit detached it merges the story lines of S1 and S2 to make it a fun ride.  Plenty of liberties are taken with original story line from the comics but its worth it.  Its fast and furious and leaps and bound from the last superman movie and Calvill is believable as Superman an alien.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,was long for no reason. ... just wait for it in dvd at walmart.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Wow, I heard that this film gets to be a bit conventional as a blockbuster, but for goodness' sake, I had no idea that DC would stoop so low as to go this far with ripping off a Marvel, to where you get, not an Iron Man, but a man of steel. Man, I hope comic book geeks are reading this and getting livid over that joke, unless, of course, they've already lost faith entirely over this project, based on the fact that it's directed by Zack Snyder, and isn't scored by John Williams, and doesn't feature Superman wearing panties. First off, forget y'all, I love ""Watchmen"", and if that isn't enough evidence to support my not caring what comic book fans say, then you should hear the stuff that I wasn't shamelessly proclaiming to the world when all of the talk about this film was starting up, because I've always had a little bit of a fear of coming out, say, once the new suit was unveiled and saying something like, ""Yes, this is smart, because it actually looks like royal alien armor, but, [b][u]if they could just get rid of that stupid cape then this would make perfect sense[/b][/u]."" I know it sounds silly to think that I should be afraid of saying that, but as superhero action films through the years have taught me, nerds have a surprisingly awesome taste in cool action sequences, so one can only imagine what they're holding back, especially if they've got Russell Crowe on their side, because as if Marlon Brando wasn't grumpy enough, this Jor-El can throw a phone faster than a speeding bullet, which is probably why he has random appearance throughout the film, seeing as how no one is giving Rusty Crowe a bit part, especially when the inspiring father figure character who you could see more of is Kevin Costner. Don't get me wrong, I like Costner and all, but you can see where Superman really gets all of his charm, as well as a commanding presence as a man of power in an unusual world that looks down on him until it is saved by his struggle to uphold justice. I was waiting for that one scene in here in which Superman pins General Zod down, then looks around and proclaims, ""Are you not entertained?"", only to realize that he had pretty much killed everyone in Metropolis, seeing as how this film gets to be a little bit carried away with its action sequences. Hey, if you ask me, I'll gladly answer Superman's question regarding entertainment value with an emphatic yes, as I, unlike annoyingly bias comic book dorks, was adequately satisfied with this film, in spite of its flaws, of which there are quite a few.

The film promises to be a more down-to-earth and dramatically sharp interpretation of a conceptually rich superhero who has, time and again, been associated with camp and over-the-top tone, and sure enough, if you're looking for a ""Superman"" that keeps things about as real as it can, then you came to the right place, though not exactly the perfect place, because as genuine and smart as this film is in a lot of ways, subtlety lapses at times, whether it be within the overdone sci-fi (Forget suspension of disbelief, this film is telling to take a lot of bull about Kryptonians), or within certain dramatic beats that go backed by slightly histrionic dialogue and mildly questionable characterization. David S. Goyer knows how to put together a compelling story, but what the annoying disagreeable fans of ""Batman Begins"" neglect to realize is that the man is just not that good of a screenwriter, thus he, regardless of what the also annoying disagreeable haters of Zack Snyder, is this film's biggest problem, and not just because of the subtlety issues that you can get over just fine (I think it's safe to say that Christopher Nolan was the one behind the logic in the ""Dark Knight"" trilogy, even though he couldn't quite sell me on the logic behind everyone's loving the series so much), as opposed to the pacing structure issues that really hold the final product back. This film is by no means the structural mess of an origin story that was ""Batman Begins"", but the pacing is still uneven, keeping you from gaining all that firm of a grip on the direction of this narrative, and being bookended by considerable extremes in pacing that betray my excitement over the lengthiness of this epic character study with padding things out with anything from excess material to overlong action sequences that give you a bit of time to question the fate of the civilians that Superman wants to protect, yet is fighting around, followed by a making up for time put on through a limited exploration of the full depths of this story, which is fleshed out enough to compel, sometimes thoroughly, but lacking in the punch I was hoping for. There is an abundance of potential to certain areas of this film, which held the potential of being the next ""Watchmen"" (Forget you all), yet Goyer, sometimes backed by that somewhat awkward overambitious atmosphere by Zack Snyder that even worked its way into ""Watchmen"" at times, does not give this storytelling the scope and depth that it deserves, and would need if it hoped to stand a remote chance of obscuring the conventionalism. Earlier, through some lame ""Iron Man"" reference, I joked that this film was more derivative than I expected, but really, I was not prepared for this, because whether you look at it as a sci-fi film, or a superhero film, or a dramatic character study, or a blockbuster, the film is consistently generic, hitting trope, after trope, after trope until predictability is left standing as rich, while you're left to struggle to find something that is genuinely notable in this film, including the aforementioned flaws that glare and drive the final product just short of what I was hoping it would be. The film's opening Krypton segment offers an excellent hook, and regardless of what everyone says about there being too much style or whatever, I found the third act to be truly outstanding in its brilliantly seamless marriage of spectacle and resonance, but between these glimpses into what could have been is a body that, while compelling, fails to cut as deeply as it should, breaking up limited expository depth with blockbuster superficiality and keeping the final product from becoming the excellent revival of an iconic series that I and it wanted it to be. Nevertheless, the film still rewards, for although this story stands to have more meet, as well as a sharper execution in the writing department, it does enough right to compel as a strong comeback for a timeless blockbuster saga, as well as yet another showcase of a certain someone's musical brilliance.

For whatever reason, people are so biased about this film that they've gone to far as to give heat the score work, calling it overproduced, unmemorable and, apparently worst of all, not by John Williams, and sure, the film's musical aspects get to be a bit formulaic, and don't really deliver on the hook that made the theme from Williams' also generally formulaic score so iconic (Of course, even then, the theme sounded so much like the also iconic themes to ""Star Wars"" and ""Indiana Jones"" that you can just barely distinguish it, like plenty of other John Williams scores), but we're still talking about Hans Zimmer, the best in the modern film scoring business, as he continues to tell you through this film by topping most every other ""Superman"" score (Sorry, John Williams fans) through immersively stylish, thrillingly intricate, resonantly dynamic and altogether consistently fine compositions that both help in defining the film and entertain thoroughly by their own right. Zimmer does not disappoint, livening things up time and again with a gorgeous musical style whose sharpness goes matched only by the film's visual style, for although Amir Mokri does not quite deliver on the consistently stunning imagery that I was kind of hoping he would, considering that he's bringing life to a visual style by someone as artistically tasteful as Zack Snyder, his cinematography's clever lighting, rich coloring and exceptional definition give the film a striking and versatile look that is never less than handsome, but has more dark-looking moments that are ruggedly gritty, and more lush-looking moments that are borderline stunning. Fine technical competence powers the film's good looks, and when technical proficiency is also found within the visual effects, there's no turning away, because if nothing else about this film is as outstanding as I expected, it's the dazzling effects whose seamlessness, audaciously elaborate intricacy and spectacle range from outstanding to awe-inspiring, particularly when they bring life to the action sequences that may outstay their welcome a bit at times, but thrill to no end with their dizzying staging - complimented by David Brenner snappy editing - and immersive filming, complimented by Nerses Gezalyan's detailed sound mixing and Scott Hecker's and Eric A. Norris' thumping sound editing. The film's action sequences are never less than intense, but the thrills grow greater and greater, until it all comes down to a duel between Superman and General Zod that is so mind-numbingly gripping, exhaustingly dynamic and, yes, at times, even inventive that it marks a satisfying capper to a showcase of awesome blockbuster spectacle, something that this film is if it is nothing else, thus making it kind of understandable why certain people would interpret this film as one big practice of style-over-substance, but not to where I can deny this film's putting plenty of attention to its core, even if such attention stands to be more thorough. This film's story concept is not as meaty as it very much could have been, and the effectiveness of its execution is all too often undercut by D. S. Goyer's uneven and borderline trite script, so don't go in expecting this mini-epic to be the movingly inspired exploration of the full depths of a classic tale that I certainly hoped it would be, but do expect this story to be inspired enough in its craft to compel, with a tone and audaciously raw spirit that couldn't be more different the more campy and fluffy tone of previous cinematic interpretations of ""Superman"" (Of course, ""Superman Returns"" had some effective dramatic beats, regardless of what the annoying comic book geeks say), and is brought to life by areas in Goyer's script that offers well-rounded characterization, which is itself brought to life by across-the-board memorable performances throughout this star-studded cast, whose standouts include the endearingly charismatic Russell Crowe, a convincingly concerned and human Kevin Costner, a commandingly effective Michael Shannon and, of course, leading man Henry Cavill, who is not asked to capture the colorful charisma within Clark Kent/Kal-El/Superman (What's with all of the names?) that made Christopher Reeve and, to an extend, Brandon Routh so memorable, but compensates with a subtle dramatic range that captures the essence within the icon as a flawed, but extraordinary soul searching for his true identity, not necessarily as a human or Kryptonian, but as a man. Cavill shows promise as this refreshing take on the iconic Superman, and breathes some life into the depths of this character study, but at the end of the day, I can't help but feel as though the performance that gives us the richest glimpses into what could have been is, as irony would have it, by the very man who everyone, with the exception of myself, had been worried about, for although Zack Snyder's direction cannot obscure the writing mishaps, and sometimes feels kind of overambitious, his underappreciated fine control of tone keeps the film consistently lively, with emotional breaks that range from engaging to resonant enough to cut through all of the subtlety problems within the writing and truly move, whether it be within the heat of the tense action, or within the depth of the more dramatically meditative moments. I wish I could say that more often than Snyder carries this film to the exceptional heights that it achieves at times and could have retained throughout the its course, but Snyder further proves his skill as an underappreciated storyteller with thoughtful substance to compliment dazzling style, and while that's not enough to make an excellent blockbuster, it crafts a film that engages through and through, with enough spectacle, depth and range to keep you thoroughly entertained and fairly compelled throughout this first taste of a new life for the ""Superman"" film franchise.

When it's time to hang up the cape again, at least for now, you look back at a film whose subtlety issues prove to be a bit offputting, and whose uneven pacing thins out a sense of direction within the narrative, while leaving this also highly formulaically-told to not feel explored enough to deliver on the excellence I was hoping for, which isn't to say that we're not still looking as a rewarding blockbuster, rich with excellent score work, lovely cinematography, dazzling visual effects and spectacular action sequences that color up the inspired telling of this generally compellingly well-crafted story - further powered by strong performances - that makes Zack Snyder's ""Man of Steel"" an entertaining and engaging superhero drama whose excellent heights are few and far between, but still bridged by plenty to enjoy.

3/5 - Good"
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It strains itself at a 6/10. The graphics and sequences where all there, world class in fact Almost every element present for good story telling, but it was way too choppy. Plus lets be honest this is the guy involved with The Watchmen, one of the few films I have ever walked out on in my entire life. Somebody who compares this to Batman Begins is crazy. Begin's has such an emotional element that quickly outclasses this film by leaps an bounds. Almost half the audience at my theater where upset. No character investment, Ms Lane falls suddenly in love with superman, and delivers a cheesy one liner kiss scene, I have seen more depth in an evaporating 2 inch puddle in the sun. The intangibles where all missing and its frustrating to be that close yet somehow miss the mark. This film is like Iron Man 3, it might be a commercial success but it has some serious cracks in the story. Cough...NO FREAking Mandarin, and then make joke out of it? The one thing I am grateful for is the introduction of Krypton's home world, which you can see some real effort. But huge detractors are SPOILER ALERT:::::::: NO FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE. Are you kidding ME? Mr Kent Dies in a Tornado while Clark watches.....are you kidding ME? His parents, especially his father show much more elements of fear/not caution which then reflect in Clark's character...are you kidding ME? Clark has a transient stage that mimics BAtman Begins=lame copy....ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Superman has been soaking up the sun for 30 years and all the Kryptonians are just as strong as him when they arrive within two days.....ARE YOU KIDDING ME. Zod is a military man so there is some credence of technique over brute strength...but still.This movie tries to show to much and ends up showing to little. Pacing was a huge issue for me. Miss Lane needed more time in a relationship and less time saving the world. Her and Clark's relationship has the least meaning and depth I have ever seen in a Superman film. She is supposed to be one of his anchors....what we met three times and we love each other...that was amazing=sarcastic The sad bit is that I like Superman more than Batman, but Batman Begins is an infinity better film. I watched this at my New RPX theater which was amazing. That's what I take away from this experience is that I can watch other premiers at this new facility. I can just give up on every seeing The Justice League which is even more upsetting considering that it possesses much better Character material than The Avengers. Superman needed to be that catalyst and I just don't see it happening now."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"To call the movie flawless would be ridiculous, but the cast is as top-notch as you get, the score is booming and the effects are awe-inspiring."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Man of Steel can be summed up in 3 words: What a disappointment. 
The opening sequence with Krypton showed so much promise and was one of the coolest, and probably the best, interpretation of Krypton ever. Sadly, right after the that, the origin story is told in a choppy manner in the span of probably just under 40 minutes, followed by a whole lot of nothing. I never thought my mind could be numbed by so much boring action and explosions. This whole movie is topped off with a slew of corny dialogue and was severely lacking any character development. I will say I loved the soundtrack of the movie, the beginning with Krypton blew me away, and the first fight in the movie was cool to see, but with so much nothing in the span of a two and a half hour long movie!.. why bother?"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie was great! Of course there will be people that will nit pick at everything and give it a bad review, but hey if your a fan of superhero genre movies then you should enjoy this one. Cant wait for part 2."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,FANTASTIC MOVIE!!!!!
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Critics today need to get a betyer job. this movie was epic and 100 times better than the original!
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"There were some elements of the movie I liked, but at the end of the day, it doesn't rate much better than above average.  The fundamental problem with Superman movies is that since he's unbeatable, you're left with protagonists that are movie-worthy.  Worth a watch, but if you're not a fan-boy or a fan of the genre, I could see waiting on it as well."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Despite receiving mixed reviews, really enjoyed this. Good reboot movie!"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,A lot of action! Definitely better than the previous one . A little long but it was a good entertaining movie .
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I was so excited and looking forward to this movie only to be somewhat let down.  The cast was wonderrful and everyone played their part to perfection.  Unfortunately the didn't have a lot of acting time on the screen.  The movie was largely a series of battles, fighting, punching, building being destroyed, destruction, more fighting and then more fighting.  Actually started to doze off through some on the relentless battle scenes."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This is one of the biggest disappointments of the year. The film is poorly paced, the acting is subpar, and the plot holes are bigger than this movie's aspirations. Just some explosions and a horribly put together story."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,As usual Zack Snyder creates some visionary candy. :)
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This film was infuriatingly bad.  Making films that will 'play well in China' leaves them void of any cultural relevancy.  Yes, people in China probably respond to explosions the same way everyone else does -- but it's destroying American filmmaking.  I've held my tongue long enough -- if you liked this film, you have very low standards for storytelling and are genuinely not too bright."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,A good looking but throughly hectic take on Superman. Totally humorless and devoid of emotion which is particularly surprising considering how hard they appeared to be trying to do the opposite.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,I don't know what the critics are talking about. I was amazed by the retelling of Superman. I loved it. It was very good.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"I went into this film with low expectations and well, I was surprised. It had emotion, depth, and a coat of freshness. Some of the action sequences bordered on CGI overload but still looked amazing and were very well done. Overall, Henry Cavill is the perfect Superman (and hottest) and I'm eager to meet him again."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,The constant shacky cam is really annoying at times and its editing is rather disjointed.  This hurts the movie but it still delievers with a good script solid preformances by every actor involved and oh yeah some of the biggest kick ass action sequences EVER put on the screen that give The Avengers a run for its money.  Man of Steel is my favorite Superman movie yet and I hope will open up a new DC cinema universe
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Henry Cavill is sooooo hot
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Man of Steel is a perfect example of a summer popcorn blockbuster. It's a story we've seen before updated with modern visuals. The parallels of superman and a Christ figure remain but is handled in a less heavy handles fashion when compared to the previous entry Superman Returns. The narrative introduces us to a young superman through the use of flashbacks which serves to break the action and provide heavy doses of narrative. Forgoing the squeaky clean image this Superman has some grit while still remaining a wholesome figure.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Mind-numbingly awful. Would've walked out after the first 40 minutes or so, but I didn't want to make my husband feel bad for talking me into going."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Made me like the hero.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"First of all, let it be said, let it be written, that I grew up with Superman. He is my favorite superhero. I've seen every incarnation of him through the years. Loved them all. With due respect to Christopher Reeve, Henry Cavill is the best of them. He's a serious actor who also happens to be drop-dead gorgeous.

But this film may not be what you expect. There's a different relationship than usual between Lois Lane and Clark Kent, and I don't know how that will work in sequels (and they have set it up for sequels; here's hoping). This Superman, across his childhood and into his adult development, is still learning about and being startled by and confused about his superpowers. This film expands the mythology a bit and takes some liberties. Plus there's not much levity in this film. No banter in the newsroom.

All of the actors are well cast. Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner as the two fathers (Jor-El and Jonathan Kent, respectively) are particularly effective. Michael Shannon as General Zod makes one of the best villains in film history.

I could have done without one of the ending battles, particularly the one that creepily made me feel like I was watching 9/11 all over again. The last individual fight between Kal-El (others call him Superman; he doesn't) and Zod is visually amazing and presents the crux of this morality tale. Remember, Superman doesn't kill. He saves.

I identified with Clark's search for identity in not really belonging to the society you find yourself in. So his emotional journey rang very true to me. In fact, I was fully engrossed in it."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Excelente pel√≠cula que nos hace olvidar por completo el bodr√≠o que realiz√≥ Bryan Singer hace unos a√±os.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,AWESOME. Amazing film
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,A little slow in the beginning but overall a great film that showed the other side of the Man of Steel.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"yes its the same story, but its a great story. Superman looks better than ever maybe we will see a sequel!"
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,No lo que esperaba.... Pero si estuvo entretenida
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Definitely my favorite DC film, and possibly my favorite superhero film. This is what the Avengers should have been."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Loved it! Romance, action, new plot...everything a Superman movie needs."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie. Loved the modern take on Supes.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,Way better than the last Superman.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"fantastic movie !!! probably the best movie I've seen in two years! ( I see a lot) Its on par with the batman remakes with Christopher nolan . lots of action , great story and the best boss fight I've seen in any comic book movie that's been produced!!! Best movie of the year I'm saying and probably from last summer too!!!"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,This was by far the best supper man movie ever made
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Ignore the critics. This was a great movie, visually stunning!!"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie ever.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I honestly expected this film to be one of the greatest movies ever made! And I'm on team batman! The movie was hyped up to be extraordinary! Although the action scenes were second to none and Henry cavil is the best superman, there should have been a more different approach to the film, they tried so hard to make the movie look good that they clearly forgot to make the movie... Any good, but that's zack Snyder for ya!"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,This was really good . Enjoyed how they changed things around and the action was great. Looking forward to another one.....lol.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Moments of sheer awesome, scattered through bobbo. It's a colourless and humourless mess that leaves you without any feeling for, or real investment in, the main character. Yes, it looks beautiful and the new origin is interesting, but the dialogue is laboured and the battle sequences flog an entire stable of dead horses before a (seemingly) poignant conclusion that the lead character seems to learn nothing from. For me, the highlight was probably the hot dog while the Pearl and Dean music was still playing - I probably should have left it at that."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Good plot. An introduction to Superman that makes more sense. Out of this World special visual and sound effects. I can't wait to watch the next one!
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,best superman movie seen in years.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"After I endured MAN OF STEEL I felt sick inside. It's a wolf in sheep's clothing. It says it's a down to earth, realistic Superman movie but Zack Snyder can't let go of his CG special effects, essentially burning millions of dollars as if he were the Joker. Then Snyder stupidly forces Superman into a moral corner and makes him do something he just doesn't do. Also the film is very long. This is evident by how bored I was. Zack Snyder makes style. Not films."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"3 words: big Big BIG!
This new superman movie was the best superman movie I've ever seen (That's not hard to do). I liked the some changes to cannon. There still were things I screamed in my head ""no no no."" But they're forgivable. I have no idea how they will top themselves next movie.
I think they made a bad choice with the over blatant product placement. Sure, show a logo once but don't have it in every shot. Product placement destroys your movie from being timeless."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I'm surprised they did a remake of ""Matrix Revolutions"" so quickly.   Some of the same actors, same special effects and fights, same heavy-handed references to the main character as Christ..."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"i had an incredible amount of fun watching this film, enough so that i can honestly say that i enjoyed it despite its flaws.  unfortunately the flaws in this film were endless.  the acting was great, the music wonderful, and the action suspenseful, but for all of the flare of zack snyder films, he has proven to me once and for all that his films are incapable of going deeper than the very surface of its characters.  im still waiting for that future great superman movie, but ill have a lot of fun watching this one until it comes."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Possibly the best film I have ever seen!
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Good superhero movie.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"One of my favorite super hero movies today!!!
Great Job Christopher Nolan & Zack Snider! 
Picked a great Superman in Henry Cavill..."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Loved it! Good to see Supes back on the big screen.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,Dragged on forever. Intro was confusing. Fight scenes repetitive.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,I believe they actually found an actor that can play the part. Christopher Nolan has also done well to make a great movie. Let's keep the formula and see a few sequels now.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"altho the best and most human of all the superman films, still sadly full of cheese"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,I've grown up watching the old super man movies with Christopher Reeves and have always enjoyed them. This movie I think would make the old superman proud. I don't know why the critics are being so harsh but maybe they are die hards to the originals. I know a great movie when I see it and this is one of them. Kevin Costner and Russell Crow where perfect for this movie. The entire cast was spot on and I hope more movies are to come.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,One of my best super heroes movie!! Loved it!!!!
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed it. Cavill is looking good as the new superman. Both dads were the best part. Last fight between Superman and Zod was impressive but if it was so easy to kill Zod, why no body thought about it earlier. Overall, its a treat."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,Watched it with my Dad and family.  Some really awesome action sequences. It really does a good job of showing the human side of Superman as well.  One thing I also enjoyed about the comic books.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,Wow. The Rotten Tomatoes critic list is really disconnected. Why do we keep trusting them? 82% of us regular peons liked Superman (with Jesus imagery and all)! Even I liked it!
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This movie does take it's time, but most fans will really get into the give and take between Superman and General Zod, etc."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,I couldn't help thinking I've see all the elements of this superhero/villain drama played out before from Hollywood. Some tense action scenes did catch me at times. It's not a flop but definitely middle-of-the-road.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,the fight scenes are better than expected would see it again
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,The best Superman. Ever.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I liked the retold story and the lessons learned by young superman. However, I felt the action sequences were a little too long and the CGI was actually hokey/clunky. Henry Cavill was definitely a better superman than Brandon R, Amy Adams was a bit restricted (it seemed) in her range. Definitely better than S-Returns but no where near the ""masterpiece"" that was the Batman saga with it's related staff. Michael Shannon was NOT Terence Stamp, but did a decent job of Zod. Overall, not a bad flick, no where near Superman II and won't compete with Iron Man 3 for the summer blockbuster"
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Great action. Weak, weak characters."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,sorry never thought I would say this....but this movie blew avengers away.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"So... We revisit a once deceased franchise that a great many (perhaps one-too-many) have speculated cannot not be resurrected, not even by the great Mr. Nolan.  Oh how wrong you all are. Despite the lackluster rating provided by this site, I would like to assure you - Man Of Steel is worth every penny you would hope to spend on a modern motion picture. Certainly it has its faults - most films are want for something.. To name a few: 1) No real witty dialogue  2) CGI Intense  3) It feels very rushed.  Now lets address those issues: 1) If you were hoping to see Superman ala Robert Downey Jr - go shoot yourself in the face. Seriously. Superman has never been about witty dialogue. Sadly, he was always been more campy than witty and this story, which considers a decidedly ""human"" view of the extraterrestrial uber-Boy Scout is...well...refreshing. Perhaps a ""darker"" vision - a more realistic vision - of our favorite good-guy might be the right approach to speaking to contemporary society (i.e., in this world of faux reality television, maybe we can afford to infuse a little more reality in our myths).  2) Yes, it is CGI intense, but honestly - the stuff this guy can do can't exactly be replicated with a REALLY TALENTED actor people. I've seen much worse done with much more (caugh- ""Transformers 3"" - caugh) and still do alright at the box office. Not to demote Mr. Cavill - I was overwhelmingly surprised by the depth this Britain brought to an American legend. Sir - you are my Superman (sorry Mr. Reeves, while you will enjoy an everlasting iconic status, you are a Superman of a different time entirely).  3) It does feel a bit rushed. I cannot so easily account for this choice in story telling. I might have opted to spread a bit more of 'Supes' background between two stories or more. That said - we all know this was a pass/fail film; cram what you can into one solid blockbuster and pray it passes the fanboy muster enough to see a sequel (or, heaven help us, more movies still) - as there may never be another chance to tell Superman's story.  All in all - it was a daring endeavor to try and reboot a character the world seems to have left behind... An epic superbeing that embodies everything America, hell - every decent human - should be about (and thus reflects everything we know we are not)... Superman fails today because he is beyond our reach. This story, as told by Nolan and crew, brings him closer to our grasp...if only we might dare to believe in legends again."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Best movie in a long time! One of my top 3 Superman movies ever. I put it right up there with Superman 1 and 2 with Christopher Reeves. Did not know what to expect going in as I had not seen much or hear much about it but was very pleasantly surprised at how much me and the kids liked it. I watch a lot of movies and have good taste, so you can trust this review. Tons of action and special effects, great acting, and Sci Fi and great story. Only thing not good about it was the same thing wrong with any movie these days which kids can potentially see is that there were a few curse words in the beginning. Hollywood needs to learn that the movie is better without them and more kids will see it and benefit from it not having the curse words."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,Wasn't a thrill to me
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I am so, so tired of CGI. Well-cast, and with a handful of real Superman moments, maybe this reboot will be improved by the sequel."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Loved the relationship that Superman has with Zod. Very well done to reboot the franchise in today's world. Most critics need to stop comparing it to Christopher Reeves, Superman franchise. I loved all the old Superman movies as well the issue is they need to see how Superman would be dealt with in today's world. I liked the flow of the story as Lois uncovers his past and why he does what he does just to run and hide again. Is a must watch and a new breath taking story telling of the Superman story."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Putting aside my geek side I would say this is such a fun and wonderful film, enjoyed every minute of it, the film runs for 2 1/2 hours but the time goes by faster than a speeding bullet. Geeky side of me hated the fact there was no Metropolis, Smallville or Superman's sanctuary in the story, it's New York! The other side of me thought though lots of time was spent on Clark's and Zord's storyline making it very strong they spent no time on Clark and Louis Lane's, they meet for 2 seconds then automatically they're together, was a bit dumb, this aside,going to be a great film to watch over n over again"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Excellent casting, solid story. Could have used less explosions and more character development. The 20 minute opening could have been 5, and minus one Russell-Crowe-riding-dragon-lizard-thing. Excited to see where this franchise takes us."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Nearly perfect movie. Why do all critics compare the film to previous movies or the comic book character? This movie is about a superman who is torn, alone, and unsure of his place in the world. How would any movie exploring a character like that be completely joyful and upbeat? All the reviews have made me sick and anyone interested in seeing Man of Steel should ignore any review that mentions previous movies or the comic book while negatively comparing the new film to either of them."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Hopefully they keep him for future movies , great stuff"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie was awesome and you need to see it and its funny in ways
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Does what it needed to do. Re-boots without trending on old ground that we have all seen before. If they'd done that people would be complaining of no originality I stead of a heartless film (which I disagree with). Visuals are epic as they should be with a near invincible 'Superman' and the flashbacks work very well. Costner and Crowe are excellent and Cavill is a brilliant Superman. Very enjoyable film and looking forward to the sequel and Justice League(if that ever happens)
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie I'd what it was supposed to. Make the superman story believable! It delivered. The actors don't really have time to develop despite the movie being 2.5 hours long. Regardless, this is a ringer!  I will see it again!"
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,Action packed and lots of destruction. Storyline similar to Batman Begins. I wasn't into the comics and was too young for the original movies but I really liked this movie.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,What a disappointment this movie was.  Nothing like butchering a great story.  It dragged on and on too.  I thought it would never end.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Battle scenes in Smallville and Metropolis are  gratuitous with no point but destruction.  New twist on old story are ok.  Generally, an enjoyable action flick."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,As someone who is old enough to have grown up watching the original superman films and thinking they were awesome this new reincarnation has big shoes to fill which it does in spades :)
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie. It was one of those movies that you cry with and punch the bad guys along side superman. The action was non-stop. And even when it seemed like it was over, it started up again. But as a colleague of mine made me realize, the fighting scenes were kind of repetitive. But I loved the movie. I thought it was fantastic."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Buena historia, desarrollo algo desproporcionado, actuaciones geniales, efectos asombrosos, las escenas de acci√≥n son las mejores que he visto en alguna pel√≠cula de superheroes y m√∫sica excelente hacen de esta una pel√≠cula m√°s que buena. Tendr√° sus errores, como la direcci√≥n de c√°mara, el desarrollo de algunos personajes, la acci√≥n excesiva y el gui√≥n puede resultar algo soso . Pero en general es un buen reboot. Superman ha regresado, perras, y regres√≥ para quedarse. No es la pel√≠cula de superman que mereciamos, era la que necesitabamos."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie and the way it was told. The new Superman is excellent. Loved him in the Tutors as well. Last battle went on a bit long, but overall a lot of fun. PS. Zod was great - I hated him. Even Jor-El was good and not always a bit fan of Mr. Crowe. But they all came together in this one."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Saw the movie. Awesome movie. Critics don't know what they're saying. Don't listen to them.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Don't listen to people who love dumbed down movies! This was a really good movie
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie is the best superman movie evere. Great scenes , The fighting is surreal I felt like I was in the movie watching  the man of steel kick ass. A few easter eggs, made me crazy with excitement of what WB can do to stat the DC Universe."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Not a perfect movie by any stretch but its certainly entertaining.  and draining.  its a non-stop action movie with great special effects and an interesting story (esp to a non-comic book guy like me).  the movie is too long though as the fights lasted too long esp considering most of them were ""even"" fights. lol at how the bad guy gets killed...how does that not just happen in one of the random fight exchanges?  the movie was, in zack Snyder fashion way over directed but it didn't kill the movie.  I don't think i'd want to see this again, but its worth seeing once."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"OK.  NEVER listen to the critics!  This movie was awesome.  Everything I expected.  If you are not entertained by this move, you are brain dead.  And the critics are brain dead."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,Please stop making superman movies. Dude is just wack.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Just great.. Awesome movie
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I really hate CGI! Ok, it's Superman, and it would be difficult to build a city and destroy it, blow up an oil-rig, etc., but it just looks fake and is well overused in this film! In parts of this movie, I had no idea what was going on! Maybe I'm getting old!!!"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Fun flick with some nice small nods hidden setting up what I hope is a start to a grand DC movie universe.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,The movie was mainly about the effects.. Though I thought they did really well with the casting. What I didn't like was that it wasn't the classic superman tale. Still worth seeing in theaters
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"General Zod did not turn out to be a drug addict actor who was hired to fool the world and the writers did not bother to add any jokes into the movie. Overall, without a laugh track and the cast of the Big Band Theory as the supporting cast, it felt very fake and poorly made."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"not too bad, good 3D experience, you feel as if your flying with him!!."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Michael Shannon: 100%
Rest of movie: 20%
Balances out to: 60%

Shaky cameras, poorly strung together scenes, the most up to date special effects, eh. I appreciated the back story, but like I said, eh.

""Are you F'n stupid"" (exact quote)

^ Hollywood what the fuck is wrong with you?"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"David G and Christopher Nolan did justice to this movie. For those who want to see action and fighting and all those things that Superman is capable of doing, please go support this movie."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Incredible movie from start to finish. At times the CGI got a bit overwhelming but overall one of the best movies of the year so far. I'm not a Superman fan but this movie made me a believer.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This was bad. I wanted to like it to other super-hero movies that go slow and have comic-book-like development but it just wasn't. It was Silver Surfer gone bad with stupid violence scenes, a villain storyline that tried to be complex but was really just drawn out so much you don't care.  Loved Amy Adams but she could have been so much more! This is not an alien film, it is a human film. Get it right next time Warner Bros."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Not sure why the critics are hating on this one.  I loved it.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,Man of Steel provides a satisfyingly serious Superman origin story before being overcome by the excessive action that consumes the last 45 minutes of the film. It would have benefited significantly from fifteen minutes more of character development. The movie assumes the viewer will accept the relationship between Clark Kent and Lois Lane and settles for never developing this chemistry.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I couldn't believe how bad it was. I didn't give a crap what was happening. Make me care next time! No character development. Blah. Next time let the trailer editing guy edit your movie. Had such high hopes, loved Watchmen."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,OUTSTANDING.  I don't usually care for superhero movies but this one was terrific!
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,The first superhero is back for a new generation and makes good on the promises it made. Cavill is this generation Superman. Can't wait to see what happens in the sequel. I just hope for a worlds finest movie now. Superman has returned
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Great cast and the movie had a good pace. Makes me wanna wear the S on my chest!
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Really enjoyed the first 2 thirds of this, particularly the stuff with Kevin Costner, found the end a bit boring despite the noise,fights etc."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,makes me want to give Superman a second chance
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,if you dont like this movie then you are a terrorist
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,This movie was completely over rated. I miss the days of Christopher Reeves wearing the blue suit. Henry Cavill was ok but the story was horrendous and there was way too much CGI for this movie to be believable. Do yourselves the favor of saving your money and wait till it comes out on DVD. Other than Superman IV this is by far THE worst of all of the Superman movies. Watch Superman Returns over this mess.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie, how all action flicks should be!"
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Kind of a hot mess. I liked it way better than the last Superman movie, but that's like saying I liked sleeping better than being in a coma. There were some things that were cool, but others... Hope it's not too spoilery, but as much as I liked Kevin Costner's portrayal of Jonathan Kent, the character himself pissed me off. And I know they were playing his death scene for pathos, but it just made me go grrrrr. Amy Adams was good. Russell Crowe was good. Zod was useless as a villain...his hot lieutenant, Faora, was much more threatening. So, overall...meh."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie was fantastic in every sense of the word. The acting fantastic. The action fantastic. The story just fantastic. Henry Cavils superman is spot on he is serious and a Boy Scout. In the comics he has always been a serious character and finally for a director not to make him funny just because that is what people expect from superheroes now a days. His acting and realism of trying to find who he is on this planet is felt from every moment he is on screen. Shannon as Zod is electric on screen I can feel his anger and his reasons for who he is come out from every pore. Cavil and Shannon were a dynamic duo on screen as hero vs Villian. Not to mention Kevin Costner and Russel Crowe ability to own there characters and be the bases of who Superman is today. The actions scenes can be a little too much at times because it is a non stop CGI collage but not so bad. Actually watching the action scenes made me think to myself that it is just so unbelievable how far our technology has come to make such realistic scenes. The love story between Lois and superman is barely there but really in this origin story they really don't need that to interfere they have the sequels to do all that. The movie all on all was a fantastic movie a superman tale we have been waiting for since the 1980's. I can't wait for a sequel and for this to come out on bluray! This move gets 5 stars from me a 9/10. Hope everyone sees this master piece from Zach Snyder and Christoper Nolan!!!
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"it's superman! I actually thought it was ok - and the way in which superman was acted, was better than the wet, comic strip way that is normally rolled out."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel brings a brilliant and dramatic take to the Superman franchise.  A deeper contrast of Krypton and Earth forces a more interesting moral choice for Kal-El as he struggles to weigh the interests of the failed civilization that gave him life and the adopted home that he fears will not accept him.   

Having Superman back makes you wonder why you wasted time with all of those lesser comic book heroes. This film is a must see in the theaters, and is destined to be a signature piece for the franchise."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,great action and back stories but little humor.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The acting was great, effects were great, the script was not. I don't know who they were writing this for, but it was obviously NOT Superman."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,I don't see another Superman ever being made after this. This film is exhilarating from start to finish!  The effects are top notch and there is never a dull moment.  Just see it!
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"What can I say, other than how disappointed I was in this movie.  I laughed at times that I'm pretty sure were not supposed to be funny and all I wanted it to do at a certain point was to end.  The story was weak and completely full of holes.  So many scenes were just completely ridiculous, especially involving the extras behind the action.  The only redeeming quality in my opinion was the acting was actually pretty good.  I liked most of the actors and the roles they were playing but the overall story and plot was just not was I was looking for.  I know they are going to make a sequel and I'll probably go see it as well, I just hope it is much better."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Loved everything about the movie! The visual effects are breathtaking! Snyder has done a great revision of the story and I like the new, marginally darker tone."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Much better than the critics are saying although it does lose it about 2/3rds of the way through , recovers well though:-)"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"The response from critics has been tepid, while the reception by the audience is anything but. Where the Dark Knight trilogy identified with the ruthless cynicism of our times, the Man of Steel directly confronts cynicism with a resurrected and suprisingly palatable idealism."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,A good solid effort to build on for the coming franchise.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,This does NOT deserve a 56%
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Thank YOU Warner Bros. David Goyer / /Christopher Nolan and ZACK SNYDER, DC Comics for getting it right time! This was by far the BEST Superman movie. YES the best, Acting, Script, Cinematography. More importantly, you get to see some history on  death of the Star known as Krypton. Henry Cavill portrays Clark / Kal-El wonderfully. He also happens to be the largest Superman I have ever seen. . Marvel Comics is getting a run for their Super Hero's movies now. I would like to see the full back story on Jor-El and General Zod! Only if Russell Crowe will be Jor-El again. This is a BIG return to a favorite Super Hero. Wonderfully done, it's long 2.5 hours, not once was I looking at my watch. Enjoy!!"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Considering the last four stunk this one was very good.
It is a great summer movie and even a more realistic Superman in this one."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,the best movie ever!..awesome!..amazing!..im speechless!
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Not perfect bit an enjoyable comic book flick
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Considering I saw this in Imax 3D it did nothing to improve the 1D personality of Henry Cavill as Superman. Dissapointing because the rest of the cast are first class, especially Russell Crowe - the special effects are outstanding and the plot very good.
Fact is, I'd go for a pint with Wolverine and expect to have a good chat - but not with this bloke, who has had a charisma by-pass."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,Yes it was good and the action was beyond amazing BUT i just wasnt satisfied
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie was absolutely amazing have seen it three  times this weekend I recommend it for everyone. Superman is back!
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Loved the origin story, action scenes, and characters. This is easily one of my new favorite superhero movies, up there with Avengers and Dark Knight. I prefered the more serious tone, instead of the ""joyful"" tone the critics wanted. The danger felt real and the fights were SUPER."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"I've seen every Superman movie ever made. I always loved Christopher Reeve as Superman. But...
""Man of Steel"" is, in my opinion, the BEST version of Superman yet to hit the silver screen, and, simply, is an absolutely MUST-SEE, awesome film.
The well-known story gets a much-needed reboot with a serious tone, minimal humor, and a dramatically different, sometimes dark, take. Henry Cavill nails it as Kal-El/Clark as well as Superman, and Michael Shannon delivers an amazing, sometimes terrifying performance as Zod. The movie has the action we've wanted to see, the devastation and deaths you would expect to see as collateral damage when super-beings battle each other, and the true menace of enemies who are nearly invulnerable and who can pitch humans around like they're ping-pong balls. Amy Adams makes a great Lois Lane, and is refreshingly not the creampuff we've often thought Lois to be. The plot is excellent and the pacing terrific. ""Man of Steel"" delivers. Heartily recommended!!"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,By far the best film I have ever seen. No boring moments!  Action from beginning to end.  This is a must see this weekend!   Superman is hot as hell too.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,Man of Steel may be visually stunning but is missing the fun of being an exciting movie.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Best Superman movie since Superman 2. Like Cavil as Supes, Shannon as Zod, the reinagined Krypton & the special effects. However the movie is too long!! The fight scenes become repetitive & EVERYTHING dealing with Lois Lane & The Daily Planet stinks up the joint!"
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"With it's overly complicated story line, it's almost like seizure fight scenes and barely explanation of story it's hard to review this film. Even more when they got three huge things correct that they didn't in the 2006 ""Superman Returns"". The Two main characters ( Lois Lane and Superman ) which were played beautifully by  Amy Adams and Henry Cavill because honestly i can't add Clark Kent for the reason that he appeared for less than 2 minutes in the film and the affects which were spot on and realistic But with it's lack of romance, lack of explaining anything in the film, lack of showing it's audience what a ""Superman"" film should be it's safe to say they were lost while writing this movie forgetting who it was about. Only showing us it was a superman film halfway threw the when he shows up in his suit. Disappointing and dead as a superman film personally to me."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,Action and story is very good. But just too sci-fi.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,The Chris Nolan Batman movies were a bit more grounded.  This was far closer to a comic sci-fi movie.  I enjoyed the ride up until the end.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Not a bad movie, but by no means up to the standards of other recent comic book franchises.  Shame I had high hopes for this one."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"I don't know why this movie received so many bad reviews. It was fantastic. I only wish we could've spent a few more minutes on Krypton, which was portrayed amazingly, as well as the flashbacks to Clark's childhood."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,Better first half then second and a bit formulaic (as are most superman movies).  But who knew that Lois Lane and Mary Jane Watson were the same person?  That girl must have a thing for superheroes!
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"The movie was great fights much as the game ""mk vs. dc"" story could be better. Overall great movie and hope you enjoy it."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"As an action-packed alien-invasion movie this is great.  However, if you wanted to see a Superman movie you will be disappointed.  This felt like a series of epic-battles (and come on, not EVERY battle can be ""epic"") strung together with a few flashbacks.  Characters felt under-developed while the story line left a lot to be desired. I was especially upset when the Man of Steel crossed a line no other Superman has ever crossed and forced me to question if my boys should be seeing this rendition of our favorite superhero ever again."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Unwatchable! Transformers all over again! Shakey cam! CGI overload! Terrible framing of action...I kept wanting to pull the camera back twenty feet so I could see what was going on. Action shots so overloaded with lens flare, shakey cam, and motion blur that you can't figure out where the focus is supposed to be. What an incredible visual mess that sinks an otherwise well written story."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Not sure what the critics are smoking. Lotta fun to watch. Great action. Exactly what you want from a Superman film.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Pretty good movie.  I think this movie caused the most damage in any movie I have ever seen!
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The acting, visuals and story is decent but the film is too slow and too cliched to be a good film."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie for superman. Henry cavil nailed the part as superman. Have no idea who choose Amy Adams for Lois Lane but they should be fired. She had none of the physical or personality traits of Lois and it was not very practical for her and superman to get together. Not that Amy its a bad actress just the wrong choice for the film.  Makes more sense to be Ricky Bobbys girlfriend not supermams. Also I thought I was watching star gate in the beginning. To much scifi. Other than that very well done!
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,The action in this movie is how superman action sequences should be!  Absolutely epic!
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel opened to towering expectations, and putting aside the invalid complaint that the film doesn't feature the ""aw-shucks"" Christopher Reeve Superman (or Brandon Routh imitating him), it mostly lives up to them. Most importantly, it corrects almost every major issue from the previous films. No more underwear, no more blind and oblivious Lois Lane, and an in-depth explanation of the motives, meanings, and biology behind Superman that were shady at best before. This time around the audience is able to actually develop sympathy for Krypton, and even General Zod (with the help of Michael Shannon's intensity), through a thorough understanding of what led the planet and it's people to ruin. The Kryptonians had exhausted their planets resources and turned their society into a class system based off of what role children were bred for. This alone makes Kal-El more compelling, the fact that he was the result of his parents asking: ""What if a child dreamed of becoming something other than what society had intended? What if a child aspired to something greater?"" and believing that their son was the last hope for Krypton.

The question that I ask critics, who have been tearing apart this film and accusing it of not being funny and lacking joy, is this: What if a superhero film dreamed of becoming something other than what audiences had intended? Finally we have a film that embraces the tone of the comics, and Snyder, known for pleasing fans with faithful adaptations (Watchmen, 300), has given us a truly honest portrayal of Superman with Henry Cavill filling out the role more convincingly than anyone else before him. With the Marvel films having perfected the ""just don't screw it up"" formula, Man of Steel, as have the previous Dark Knight films, aspires to something greater. The purer archetypes of the DC universe require a much different tone than the Marvel films, which at this point are becoming stale. Although Man of Steel doesn't quite ascend to the heights of the Dark Knight films, it inherits an even bigger heart through its beautiful flashbacks of Clark growing up and the touching portrayals of Jonathan and Martha Kent by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane. The standout performance of this movie, which already features a stellar cast, is Russell Crowe as Jor-El. No disrespect to Marlon Brando, but Crowe lays waste to the previous portrayal and steals every scene he is in as Superman's charismatic biological father.

This film is not perfect, and where the issues creep in is through the occasionally jarring shifts from delicate character moments to major action set pieces. Other complaints have been leveled at Snyder for having too much enthusiasm about big explosions through all the collateral damage that occurs in the film. But I think that complaint is forgetting the entire fact that General Zod brings along a whole group of Kryptonians with him and attempts to terraform the Earth. Let's just face it, there was going to be some destruction. 

Snyder has finally given us a film that shows us all that Superman is capable of, and consequently his best one yet. His hand-held shooting style suits Man of Steel perfectly and breaks the mold of his previous slow-motion heavy films. Almost as if channeling Terrence Malick, we see close-up shots of butterflies, clotheslines in the wind, and the Kent's dog panting in the yard; images that we simply don't associate with seeing in a superhero film. Along with the help of Hans Zimmer's humble and impressively rhythmic score, what could have been a bland origin story turns out to be a multi-faceted tale about the Earth's first contact with an alien that has lived his life in America's heartland and grows up to be a man who is searching for his identity. In this way, we get a more intimate understanding of the character than what we have seen previously, and an incredibly compelling narrative.

There is a scene near the end of Man of Steel where Clark says to his mother that he wishes his father could've seen what he had done and what he had become, and as we flash back to Jonathan and Martha Kent looking on as Clark dons a red sheet on his back as a child, she says that he already did. Now, thanks to Zack Snyder, David Goyer, and Christopher Nolan, so have we."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,Hollywood needs to realize that action does not make a movie.  I don't know how this movie was 2.5 hours long when barely anything happened!  There were several interesting concepts but they either fell apart or didn't really go anywhere.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"A great movie, if you love Superman, you will love this movie. It was Nice to watch it with my kids, reminded me of when I watched it with my dad. Happy Father's day!"
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"On Krypton his symbol represents ""hope."" On Earth it stands for ""stay away from yet another train wreck of a Superman movie."" 
Beyond disappointing. Terrible dialogue, delivery, and direction."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"the action scenes were sub par,  fast and furious could have truly helped in that regard."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"MoS is, for better or for worse, an action packed ball of serious melodrama; and in a way, it's a breath of fresh air for the genre.

Where Marvel keeps pounding us with heroes that don't have over-the-top impressive powers (aside from Hulk, I suppose) and marrying it to constant ""witty"" humor to keep viewers from taking it too seriously. Superman instead, makes the daring attempt of becoming a heavy drama mixed with ludicrous amounts of flawless action.

And you know what? That really worked for me. I'm so tired of Marvel's formula and seeing them treat  this film with a degree of elegance really suited Mr. Kent.

I also found a lot of love for main characters, Clark blundering from adolescence to adulthood and making the hard decisions he had to, Lois for being an in-your-face get-out-of-my-way reporter and Zod, for being a man born to care for a world that was meant to die. (YOU STOLE HIS SOOUL)

Granted the film's not perfect but a lot of it is forgiveable. The melodrama feels heavy handed somewhere down the road after the 10th flashback or something and I'm going to assume critics are going to complain about the overuse of jello-building-action.

People may also complain about a lack of romance but at what point of the story did it feel like romance was necessary? Or even at the top of anyone's mind? IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD.

One last thing I have to mention again though, because I absolutely loved it, was the action. Every scene with Faora had me jumping with glee and every fight had me on the edge of my seat. It's a shame very few critics have an appreciation for visual mastery. They see violence and explosions, then automatically assume a shallow product. I'm embarassed for them."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Looooooove it!!!!!!!
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"I don't understand how a single human being could dislike this film.  This is one for the ages, one of the greats of all time.  And I've seen over 1,100 films."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great story, awesome action. Will go see it a few more times in the theatre I am sure. For any hardcore superman fan, this is a freshingly awesome movie. The ""critics"" are insane. This movie is great."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Everything about the story went to fast, but it wad still a good movie. They just have to work on the characters."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Enjoyed the movie. Fight scenes went a little too long and became boring. Although at the NYC never looked better.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Much better than expected, a really good film, very enjoyable"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Absolutely brilliant film
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Couldn't have asked for more for the first instalment of the new Superman franchises. Looking forward to the next films to see how Supes progresses and perfects his skills.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Wow. Quite possibly the best superhero movie I've seen in a long time.  Diane Lane and Kevin Costner played the Kents so well, I teared up.  Unlike some. I enjoyed the re-imagining of the Krypton origin story.  I caught the Lex-corp and Wayne company logos.  Hinting at a sequel and possibly a Justice League movie.  I can see how the are people who don't like it.  I'm not one of them."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,If I wanted to see Man of Steel I would have played a video game. I totally get why the reviews are so low. It's Sucker Punch with a cape: bloated and manipulative.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome movie....will see it again.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,great movie great story line .loved it .
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I've never been a fan of Superman, but for a Superman movie it was alright. It had some good action scenes and paid a lot of attention to the backstory. However, there were a lot of corny scenes, which is to be expected with Superman, and some abruptness in the story progression. Overall it was better than I expected... I was going in with very very low expectations."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great action, good acting and lots of eye-popping scenes. An enjoyable film but not without its flaws."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Yes, Superman is the Man of Steel. Steel that's used  as a wrecking ball to destroy or damage every building in Metropolis and Smallville. The end. Seriously. That's all that happens. A waste of time"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"The man of steel, the man of tomorrow, the last son of Krypton; call him what you like, Superman is a cultural icon that deserves a modern yet prestigious re-imagining on the big screen. 'Man of Steel' certainly delivers this, and like Supes himself, the film soars. The combination of Snyder's elaborate and expansive action sequences, with Nolan's and Goyer's inherent ability to manipulate narrative structure, makes 'Man of Steel' a dream for any Superman and comic book fanboy (like me), but also the average cinema goer. Cavill is more than convincing as Supes and the rest of the cast certainly add to the distinction of the whole picture. Zimmer's soundtrack is immense, his best work in my opinion, and it accentuates every scene with emotion and intensity. Overall, 'Man of Steel' has set the precedent for DC Comics alongside Nolan's 'TDK trilogy'. Whether 'MOS' will set up another successful DC trilogy, eventually leading to a 'Justice League' film, is pure speculation however, one thing is for certain; 'Man of Steel' is the film that both we and Superman deserve."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"This seems to have mixed reviews but I thought it was great. It didn't drag, was an interesting take on the traditional Superman story, and was very entertaining. The music was excellent too. We saw it in 2D and didn't regret it."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,very interesting lesson in the history of Superman.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Action Filled, well defined and with a few boringly paced moments, it's a great Action movie, and a perfect kickstarter for New Superhero Saga."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Loved the focus of the story. Visually impressive with incredible fight scenes. Henry Cavill did a good job playing Clark Kent.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"While I thought at parts the movie was a bit over the top it delivered on what it was, the origin story providing character development and stayed true to what it is, a super hero action movie. Only so much can be covered in the first movie and they crammed a lot of information into the first one in a powerful way leaving the subsequent films to further the story between the characters and villains to come. It's an action and sci fi movie that delivered a realistic telling of how it could happen now and also integrated designs and story elements from a few contemporary Superman stories/artists. Instead of an over analysis on what it didn't have such as in romance, humor etc just take the origin tale for what it is, a comic book."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,this was not a fun summer film. The actors weren't great and the story was lacking in so many things. During the very very long fight scene at the end of the movie I was ready to go home. Very disappointed.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A perfectly satisfactory reboot. So many movies of this genre today try too hard to top the original and end up falling short as a result.  To my knowledge, Nolan's ""Dark Knight"" series is the only modern example of the reboot  surpassing the original. Snyder's ""Man of Steel"" does not top the Donner films of the late 70's, but it does stand shoulder to shoulder with them. Henry Cavill is no Chris Reeve, but he gets the job done. Not surprisingly the strongest  performances were delivered by Russell Crowe as JorEl and Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent. Amy Adams does Lois
 Lane justice, but hardly the performance of her career. All in all, it's nice to know that DC now has something up its sleeve besides Batman."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"While the casting, cinematography, score & special effects were exceptional, I was very disappointed that the talent of Christopher Nolan, David Goyer & Zack Snyder couldn't create a smarter story, more interesting characters & wittier dialogue. As a result, there was no one I cared about, no dramatic tension, no fun & no memorable moments that make me want to see it again, much less recommend to others. C'mon guys...you can do better! Next time.












While the casting, cinematography, score & special effects were exceptional, it's very disappointing that the talented trio of Nolan, Goyer & Snyder couldn't craft a smarter story, wittier dialogue or characters that we care about. As a result, there's nothing compelling or memorable to motivate me to return or recommend the movie to others. C'mon guys...you can do much better. Next time."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"I don't see why some of the critics jumped on the back of this film so much. ""Lacks humour"" one review read! Why is humour so necessary in a film like this. As you would expect, this is more of a 'comic' type graphic novel adaptation along the lines of Avengers Assemble -  big on CGI, big on set pieces, big on catch your breath action. There is much less of Nolan's brooding, moody Dark Knight visible here. 

Cavill makes a great Superman and you really feel the conflict within him as he reluctantly comes to terms with his fate. It is predictable and contains some plot holes. The Louis/Superman relationship could also have been built more solidly. All in all, some flaws but a solid enough summer blockbuster."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies I have ever seen, a lot f people don't like it though."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,EPIC!! Finally they got it right - Loved everything - Perfect!!
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Loved, loved, loved this adaption of Superman!!!!!!!!!!"
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"So a final worthy reboot to superman? Not quiet.  Zack synders take is very different to ones we've seen previous I.e. Richard donner. The opening sequence sets forth a great start with krypton like you've never seen before. Russell crowes Jor-el is simply mesmerising.  The rest you already know.  Flash forward and Clark kents story is one of an outsider, a loner his childhood told in effective flashbacks.  It's this point we see that he indeed is an alien making us which
Previous films have never done.  This Clark Kent/superman is far too serious and that's the tone of the whole film.  It never lightens up.  The action sequences are great but nothing you've not seen before.  Dare I say that this superman is pretty soulless.  On the plus side all actors bring their a game. Henry cavil is a good superman but just not a great one.a solid entry into the superman franchise, I just wanted more"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Phenomenal movie. I have no idea what the hell the critics, who have this sitting at a 56% fresh rating, were watching."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,I don't care what the critics say it was a great start to the new modern day superman and can't wait to see what happens next. I hope the sequel will show a more pure hearted superman and not a Lex Luther
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"I don't know what movie the critics saw, but this movie was great! Worth every penny."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This movie in no way resembled any Superman franchise I have seen including the old series with George Reeves. It was disjointed, long and loud. Absolutely awful."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Best incarnation of Superman thus far, thanks to stellar casting and the close shepherding from Goyer, Nolan, and Snyder. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because some of the fight sequences are too blurry and sometimes the editing is a little choppy."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,While not the best Super Hero movie I think Rotten Tomatoes was way to harsh on this movie.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"the movie had me routing for Zod, the movie was action-packed and it funny moments too,
the only thing that would ruin this movie is if they make a video game like superman 64."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Nice to see the original storey again. In the imax 3d the sound was the best part, CGI was great. Downside was way to many people crashing through buildings."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Painfully boring.  The fight scenes are pretty, but there is nothing holding them up."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Very good indeed. Great direction, good performances throughout + crazy badass effects and insane action."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,with out a doubt the best Superman movie yet. The movie kept me entertained all 2 hours and a half of it and once it was over I wanted more.
"Jun 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I'm afraid the movie was a bit of a mess in my opinion: clumsy romantic scenes and disjointed story, glued together with superficial pearls of wisdom from 'pa. An overindulgence in fight scenes and special effects eventually left me numb to it all."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"I never was a huge superman fan... Actually come to think about it I disliked him because he was so perfect. I watched this movie because of the convincing trailers and due to the cast and team behind the movie. AMAZING MOVIE!!!!  It's more science fiction than straight up superhero flick and that's a good thing. Snyder really had you thinking about how superman isn't human, he is a alien and is trying to fit in. Sure the story isn't a masterpiece but it works great. What really pops is the action, the devastation to metropolis is far greater than the destruction to New York In Avengers. Don't listen to the critics because this is a great movie and I hope it does really good at the box office because the future of DC movies rests on Superman's shoulders."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"probably the best superman movie to date. there are a few flaws here and there, the forced relationship with lois, and a couple other things, but ultimately, the good outweighs the bad by far. Cavill does a solid job as Supes, but Crowe and Costner kind of steal the movie"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"This was well worth the time!!

To all the haters who think this did not have enough plot or Superman was too gloomy and brooding do not know your history of Superman! Consumed by his loneliness and always feeling like he is in a glass house!! Superman is the most moody dude in the DC universe. 

This was a good film. I did not wanna go see Superman save the world from nuclear weapons or pull cats from trees. I wanted to see a guy powered by the sun (which puts out more energy in one minute then we have in all our existence on earth) pummel some shit..nuff said! Superman delivers a good romp. If u want a good plot go watch Terms of Endearment! If u want super-powered beings tearing some shit up on a epic scale..go see this move. 

This was a rare chance for me see a Superman doing what I have wanted to see him do for years...not pull any punches! Lets get real folks...u invulnerable to everything, can fly and some bald half pint executive is your arch-enemy? I just hope the sequel pits him against someone who gives him the challenge Zod does. Cuz if its that cornball Lex Luthor, I will skip it! 

This movie only gets four stars cuz I did not see a hint at a sequel."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Man of steel is an attempted Science fiction movie by a team that doesn't know elementary physics. Recent cartoon movies by DC comics seem to be scientifically more accurate and better plots. Director has created his own version of superman. This is not the superman I am familiar with!!! I m not convinced by how superman's power fluctuate depending on atmosphere, while according to conventional superman model, his powers are mainly due to Earth's weaker gravity and yellow Sun. In this movie, atmosphere changes and superman is weaker than everyone. 
One more thing, Gravity increases, resulting in missiles changing directions and even jets falling, but humans have no problem and are running as if its normal(gravity). And while everything is being sucked into so called black hole(didn't behave like one) gravity turns negative as rocks etc. start rising towards it, but Lois keeps on falling as if under normal gravitational field!!!!
But credit where due, this movie has breathtaking graphics and action. And I also like the modifications to the original story line. Plot build-up was not bat either. It were only some scientific inaccuracies that are ticking me off!"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,It is a great way of telling the story and how it could blend with the world today. 100 day accident free. lol
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie was awesome. The problem you encounter is with people who went in expecting some emotion filled love fest superman that has been featured in every rendition since the 70s, (ESP thanks to 2006 superman returns and it's underwear model star). This is a superman for the modern age. The focus is on being an outcast and trying to find his place among us. Very real, very action packed very awesome!!! Best superhero movie since dkr and avengers"
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"fue buena, buena accion, pero le falto"
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"The biggest problem with making any Superman movie happens because Superman has been around for so long that everyone has a favorite quirk about the hero that they love.  This poses an impossible problem for the filmmaker, because the movie can't be everything that everyone wants to see. I found Man of Steel to be very well put together, with a clearly edited and straightforward plot, and found it to have no self contradictions.  This puts it miles ahead of most comic book movies.  The acting was very good, there were no idiotic characters doing idiotic things, and I found the character development to be clear and precise.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie as a very solidly placed anchor for a new series of updated stories about a Superman for today.  I did notice quite a few 5 to 7 year old kids in the theater, and the movie earned that PG-13 rating by being more violent than these parents might have expected.  Some caution should probably be exercised in bringing small children to this movie. Overall, this was an excellent, entertaining, and solidly constructed science-fiction movie that I might need to see again."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"56% from the critics on rotten tomatoes when the rest of the world seems to be rating it 80%+ is just another reminder why sane people don't listen to movie critics. They put forth complaints that the movie was too serious, had too much action, didn't have enough back story. How are these criticisms! The world asks for a darker, serious spin to get away from the cheesy superhero movies, and this delivers and then you complain it isn't cheesy enough. It's an action movie and you complain that the action was too exciting. And it's the superman story already, one of the most well know stories in the world, and you complain that there wasn't enough character development! Seeing this 56% show up on Rotten Tomatoes just makes this site look ridiculous."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,I loved it. Hit all the right notes.
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Had low expectations due to the number of poor critics reviews. As per usual poor reviews from the critics are normally a good indication the movie will be worth seeing. And so it was the case with Man of Steel. A tad long perhaps and the battle scenes suffered with over the top effects and a bit hectic. But other than that we loved it. Enjoyed the way his younger years were mixed into the main story so we didn't have to go through the whole story again from scratch. The baddies were suitably bad, no messing and they actually killed. The General was excellent. And Cavill was superb as Superman, although i thought i was watching the new Wolverine movie at the start. Looked very much like Wolverine saving the riggers, not Superman.
Forget the critics, they know nothing. Look at the audience score, 82% vs 56%."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie is criminally underrated. In what world would critics actually rate spiderman 3 higher than this movie. Granted it has flaws. But the critics are so attached to christopher reeve superman and they're so out of touch with what the people want they can't give valid opinions anymore. The movie isn't anywhere near perfect, but it was a great start and should have ranked at least in the high 70s for percentages."
"Jun 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It was a good film, but too much product placement, and some elements weren't dealt with well."
"Jun 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Likes : Henry Cavill was perfectly cast. A year ago when I had first heard who was going to portray the Big Blue Boyscout I was a little worried. Not because of his acting chops but because he didn√¢??t look like the Superman I know and love. All of that became null. And Suoerman punched things√¢?¬¶ a lot. Story was strong playing on the heartstrings of belonging. It also had a clear, easy to hate villain with Michael Shannon playing Zod. Also, the 3D conversion in this film was fantastic!

Dislikes : Amy Adams. I was a big fan of Amy Adams in almost everything else. However she wasn√¢??t the boisterous, loud and confident Lois Lane I would have cast. I would have liked to see either Olivia Wilde or Milan Kunis cast in the role, regardless of whether they were up for the part or not. I√¢??ve droned enough about that though. Some of the sound design was lacking. And finally, I never felt like Supes really got grounded in humanity because all he faced was rejection from mankind except for with his mom.
Overall, I give it a 92/100. This is the Superman movie we√¢??ve been waiting for. Stay tuned for a full review tomorrow afternoon. I√¢??m gonna go watch it in 2D now."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie yet!
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Loved this movie, mainly because Henry Cavill is perfect casting and Amy Adams is a great Lois Lane. The movie itself was a good Summer action movie, rather than a great Superman movie."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,I wanna c this movie it looks awesome
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"It's superman, epic in every way, fun, and action packed."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Best superhero movie I have seen, second would have to be Spider man 1 and Dark Knight"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,All happens rather quick but he does throw punches.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"I loved it!  Great acting, the soundtrack is amazing, visually stunning, and I really liked the backstory.  The opening scenes on Krypton are great.  I felt there was a little too much action in the latter half of the movie, but I think it set up a very strong base for the future of the series."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"I'm no critic, but something needs to be said about this movie. Almost all the time, if a superhero movie is taking a epic, realistic-ish approach to the hero the first movie is pretty dull. Batman begins in my opinion was pretty bad. The squeals in the dark knight series however where spectacular. I liked this movie a lot, but i can understand wahy some may not. For those people just keep in mind the ""stupid back story part"" has been dealt with."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"This was a excellent version of the original. While keeping the same story line they enhanced it towards modern story that fits now.

There is no extra scenes after the movie so don't waste your time waiting."
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Although Man of Steel completely neglects all of the Superman story lines before it (even leaving out Kryptonite and Lex Luthor)  I could be ok with this movie if it at least had somewhat good directing or writing. There was very little character development so by the time the 1 hour long action sequence came I didn't care whether any of the characters died. I was not at all invested into their storys because I had little time to actually get to know them or even like them. The movie and the actors were so emotionless I was hoping that at some point Superman would die so I could see some emotion out of someone besides seriousness. No, I do not want the movie to be as silly and ridiculous as Iron Man tends to be but at least give me some wit or charm so I can find interest in the character before I start watching him repeatedly (very, very, repeatedly)  tackle people through buildings. This movie is a severe disappoint and definitely not worth the money to see it."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"After watching Man Of Steel for the third time, I must say it is still just as great as ever. This film ranks with the original Spiderman as one of my favorite superhero movies of all-time. Such a great movie."
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,It really seemed like I was drunk the whole time or something
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Epic scale. Great storytelling. Falls short in one aspect is the only reason it's 4.5 instead of 5.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"I don't understand the critics issues with this movie, It was the Superman movie I always have wanted to see. I thought the special effects were awesome. I like how the story was told. I would recommend people go see this and ignore the critics."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,amazing. good story line. a little predictable but it was awesome.
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"¬®You just have to decide what kind of man you want to grow up to be, Clark. Whoever that man is, he¬¥s going to change the world.¬®

There is no doubt in my mind that Man of Steel is a far more superior movie than its predecessor: Superman Returns. The franchise has gotten a positive reboot with director Zack Snyder at the helm and Christopher Nolan as one of the producers. I know this isn't a perfect film, I thought it had several flaws, but compared to Superman Returns this is a masterpiece. What surprises me is that even though most critics acknowledge the fact that this is a superior film, in Rotten Tomatoes this film was only recommended by 57% of critics, compared to the 75% that recommended Superman Returns. For those of us who have seen both movies we know that is a tremendous flaw and most critics would agree that they gave too much anticipated love to Superman Returns which was a really mediocre movie. I can understand why they disliked this film because I think the film suffers from an action overdose. There is just way too much action in this film and it grows repetitive and tiresome. Snyder goes overboard with the action sequences and there is just way too much destruction that goes unaccounted for. I mean the entire city of Metropolis gets completely destroyed in this film and there are far too many 9/11 references here. That is the major issue I had with this film. Other than that I thought the movie had a great cast. Henry Cavill made for an exciting and near perfect Superman, Amy Adams nailed her role as Lois Lane, and Michael Shannon was a convincing villain as General Zod. Besides the cast, I also thought the flashback scenes involving the young Clark Kent were the strongest moments of the film. It was those quiet moments that I enjoyed more than all the loud action scenes in which Clark Kent was struggling to find his new identity. Those scenes worked really well for me and I thought Kevin Costner and Diane Lane were wonderful playing his Earth parents. I wasn't a big fan of the opening sequence in Krypton, but thought Russell Crowe also was convincing as Jor-El. 

The film opens in Krypton where we see Jor-El (Russell Crowe) help his wife give birth to his son, Kal-El, the first natural birth in the planet in a long time. The planet is at the verge of being extinct and Jor-El finds hope in his son, although General Zod (Michael Shannon) has different plans for his people. Despite Zod¬¥s efforts to stop Jor-El, he manages to send his son to Earth where he can survive. At Earth he is adopted by Jonathan (Kevin Costner) and Martha (Diane Lane) who find him in their field in Kansas. The film centers on Clark (Henry Cavill) as he struggles to find meaning and purpose for his life. With the help of his parents he begins to deal with his powers, but is reminded that he should use these abilities as little as possible because the world isn't prepared for someone like him. The scenes involving Clark¬¥s childhood and his upbringing with his parents is told through a series of flashbacks as we see a much more mature Clark searching for the meaning of his existence in one place after another. He finally finds some answers when an ancient craft from Krypton is located on Earth and that is when he also runs into journalist, Louis Lane (Amy Adams) who discovers Clark isn't a regular human being. His secret life is shattered when General Zod makes a theatrical entrance in his spaceship along with his crew and asks mankind to surrender the alien. Of course Zod has other intentions for the planet and doesn't really settle for Kal-El. This is where the battle and destruction on Earth begins, and Clark Kent ironically remains the only hope for mankind.
 
Man of Steel delivers and fans of blockbuster action films will love this film. I thought the action sequences suffered from too much overload and repetitiveness. The scenes are extremely exaggerated and they grew tiresome after a while. I loved most of the film, but the last 45 minutes took a toll on me and made me enjoy this film less and less. That doesn't mean I didn't like this and of course I would rather sit through this than watch Superman Returns again (a film that critics seem to have enjoyed more). The problem is that after so many great superhero films, Man of Steel does fall short to other films like The Dark Knight or even Iron Man. It is probably at the same level as Thor, but I wouldn't say this is a great superhero film because it is inferior to the bar that the Batman franchise set. I even think Iron Man 3 was a better movie than this, but Man of Steel did have its moments and I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people really like this blockbuster film considering the excellent cast and the wonderful performance from Henry Cavill as the new Superman.

"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,I saw it yesterday and I loved how you got to see more of the planet kripton. I was amazed on how much action it had for one movie. defiantly beats the action that Avengers had. I recommend watching it. p.s Cavill is superman!
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie delivered for what it is suppose to do and what everyone was asking for out of Superman. There are plenty of flaws to point out but none that take away from the film overall. Although Amy Adams is a capable actress I found her casting as Lois Lane odd, but she did a decent job. The special effects are outstanding throughout the movie. Many reviews continue to compare this movie to all the wrong material. It isn't Marvel, Disney, or The Transformers. The DC Universe does not play the same as Marvel and never will. If you were looking for comic relief then this is the wrong universe to travel in. As far as the destruction of a city, I have yet to see a blockbuster comic book movie over the past five years that doesn't have some sort of chaos in it. So if you really want to see Superman be Superman then this is the movie for you. If you want a bunch of one liners and romance between Lois and Clark this isn't. Take for what is is and have a good time."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"was freakin awesome. been waiting for this since the news broke of a remake.  I hope they spin off and do a few awesome things with this and these people.  a movie focusing in deep on the back story ( smallville), and a future movie about his  life in the public eye (superman). this could go somewhere big and follow all the great trilogy. like hence the wolverine franchise and Batman. that's what all the superman movies lack. time with the character.. ."
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Man of Steel is the most hollow and miserable superhero film I have encountered to date - if one could even call it a film. There is barely a vague semblance of plot and character development buried amidst the 150 minute slew of consistent explosions, screeching noises, and incomprehensible camerawork that refuses to sit still for even the quietest of scenes. Watch Man of Steel only if you wish to induce a migraine and seething anger."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"I've been a DC Comics fan 32 of my 38 years alive, the short version of what I'm going to write below is: if you want to know how Superman is on the media for what it was created, this is the best adaptation of a comic book on an hypothetical ""real-life"" setting.

I'm a musician, music producer and have a degree on dramatic arts. One of my earliest memories is about DC Comics, so I'm very familiar with the characters, their dynamics, conflicts, etc. This movie must be, along with The Dark Knight, one of the best pieces done in cinema for a contemporary comic book character from beginning to end. The acting is convincing, the story within itself makes sense and you are given enough information in order for you to figure out the emotional travel of the people that is important for the plot to flow in balance with the very well crafted action scenes that looked pretty close to what I'm use to read every week. Even for the more romantic comic book fans, he doesn't immediately fly, he ""jumps as high as the tallest building"".

In conclusion, this can be clearly the start DC and Warner Brothers needed to do a cinematographic reboot to his franchises, making of both Man of Steel and Henry Cavill a way more appealing Superman than a dated Donner film or the horrible ""Superman Returns""."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Hans Zimmer's music is great, Snyder does a good job in the director's chair, Crowe, Adams and Fishburne are perfectly cast, and the action is breathtaking, however, the film isn't edited in the correct order. Otherwise, it's great!"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Good movie I liked the Christopher Reeve look they did a few times.
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I was hoping for more than what we got. The first half fleshed out Superman's back-story and I kinda liked that part. I thought Costner was thoughtful and loving and very believable as his earth dad and Diane Lane was good as his mom.
Russell Crowe was also good as his real dad.
 But for me, the special effects just tried too hard and got in the way...all the way throughout. It was almost a chore to keep up with what everything was or was supposed to be.
The 2nd half was today's version of super hero film...fighting, explosions and special effects ad infinitum. The last half hour to me was tedium. At one point I said, Oh please someone just kill someone and end this.
I think it was well cast and had some nice moments but to be honest, I thought the role of superman (not the acting) left him devoid of personality. He had not fire or playfulness. He looked awesome though.
So I liked it but didn't love it which is sad because I was an extra in the Metropolis bombing scenes and I soooo wanted to love it."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,ESPECTACULAR. NOTHING LESS THAN THAT.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Pretty amazing superman origins movie.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"The storytelling of the back story is completely devoid of emotion and some of the whole plot is just completely implausible. However, when the film picks up its pace for the last 45 minutes or so, it's ferocious fighting dazzles and some emotion does eventually seep out."

"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,great move plenty of action
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"The critics can go eat their face.  This was a great superman movie.  Well filmed, good acting, engaging story, good music (Hans Zimmerman), and leaps over the major hurdle of all superman movies which is verisimilitude.  The alien element allows the superhero element better to be swallowed.  Though the ending could have been better, it's still exactly what I want and have wanted to see in a superman movie."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Total reboot!  forget u ever saw a Superman movie!  go with an open!
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This was by far the best adaptation of Superman for the future of this franchise. It had big emotional scenes as well as big action sequences to excite the superhero fans. If you go in expecting a Dark Knight quality film, you will be let down. This is not a picture perfect movie, but it is by far the best Superman live-action film so far. It holds it's own and if you love the originals thats fine!!!!! It's not meant to replace them. It's a new step toward a future of the DC universe. If you love Superman and you love big action and visual spectical. Than this is the movie for you! 5/5"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,the best superman ever ..kick ass ..bye bye ironman
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,solid comeback for superman.  not perfect but pretty dam good.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Was very good. Just a little to long. Much better than Superman Returns!
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,All I have to say is the same critics gave Superman Returns 75%..... enough said.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,A cinematic masterpiece wlth a storyline truely fitting of a great all American super hero that none of the other superman movies could even come close to. Man of Steel was dark and gritty but heart warming and powerfully uplifting showing the type of person that we all strive to be.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"An epic amazing Sci Fi action movie!  Although it does not have a campy ""superhero"" fell, Zack bring a very realistic feel to this amazing film.  The complaint I feel out there come from those who don't really know Superman and wanted to see more jokes like in the Avengers.  Bottom line, the movie is amazing, great story, killer action scenes, and a new established vision of the Man of Steel."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Man of Steel is the Superman movie I've been hoping someone would eventually make. This is awesome popcorn entertainment that doesn't neglect substance.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is the Superman movie we've been waiting for.  While not without its flaws, this film is epic, serious, and emotional.  It is the perfect blend of the styles of two visionary directors and producers Christopher Nolan and Zach Snyder.  I especially enjoyed the touches of Zach Snyder's style in the ""History Lesson"" given by Jor El to his son in the fortress of solitude, Zod's arrival announcement, and in the ""hallucination"" scene aboard Zod's ship.  
And finally, for me Hans Zimmer brings it again.  This guy is a musical genius and his score perfectly frames the tone of the film.  

Regarding the character's, for me Henry Cavill IS the Man of Steel in both looks and personality.  He is also a character that throughout that I personally found myself caring about and cheering for thanks to hour his character is fleshed out through the use of flashbacks.  Seeing Clark Kent as tortured and conflicted serves his overall character better than the bumbling fool he was in films past.  Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are perfect as two humans doing their best to raise in instill human morality in something that is far from human. Russel Crowe's performance brings some redemption from the awfulness he brought to his last film. Micheal Shannon's General Zod is ruthless and serves as a nice bridge in the origin nature of the story.  Amy Adams is an OK Lois Lane.  I personally thought she could have brought more to the role as its not exactly like she had huge shoes to fill.  I actually think that Kate Bosworth did a better job in Superman Returns even though the role in that film was not nearly as well written as in Man of Steel.  

I have read a number of professional reviews and I am shocked at some of the criticism this film is getting.  I think some of the greatest criticism given by the critics for me were strengths for the film.  I particularly really enjoyed that this was a serious movie, not one with campiness or silliness.  I often finds that comedy takes away from the ""Superhero"" franchises.  Not only that but I can't recall a whole lot of humor in the Nolan Batman Trilogy or Zach Snyder's The Watchman, 300, or Sucker Punch.  I think this seriousness is why this Superman film will endure longer then those that came before it.  All in all, check your preconceived notions about the Man of Steel at the door, buckle up, and enjoy this ride.  Looking ahead at the other summer films I think this one is going to be difficult to top."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"best superman ever. darker; bleaker , deeper."
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,I have confirmed that I am not a Superman girl.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,I'm a true fan of the Superman legend!
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Flat and boring. I found myself yawning at the action sequences and laughing at parts that weren't meant to be funny. Superman found it too easy to be super, and didn't have many human qualities. He instead was an overbearing, and even creepily nice Kryptonian with a will to save Earth for some obscure reason."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"A pretty good movie. Took my wife to see it as our last date. Not sure what my expectations were going in but i was very surprised at what they were able to do with the origins story of one of the most iconic comic book heroes. Well told and visually stimulating it is worth the preorder when it comes out on video. 


Overall though i still have to say that iron man 3 has been my favorite movie so far but this is a close second."
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"""Man of Steel"" was an epic flick filled with lots of sci-fi & comic style action. Henry Cavill is a pretty damn good Superman! Finally a guy who ""looks"" like he might be ""super"" after all  with muscles and hirsute chest to match ;) Superman purists are upset with the end of the movie - but really what is the big deal? I could have lived without so much Russel Crowe - thought his character became a bit cliched & redundant. I love this new ""Man of Steel"" and hope to see more hunky Henry Cavill wearing the cape...maybe minus the shirt :)"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"After the complete dead end that Bryan Singer's 'Superman Returns' mysteriously led us to, this is without a doubt the reboot the character needed.
Henry Cavill is the perfect Superman as is Amy Adams the perfect Louis Lane... in fact it's pretty much a perfect cast with superb performances from Russell Crowe, Diane Lane and Michael Shannon as General Zod. 
Forget every Superman film you've seen before, it couldn't be further away from the  Christopher Reeve classics, this  is a special effects driven juggernaut that stands proud alongside the likes of Avatar and the Star Trek reboots.
There is no denying the film  is about 20 mins too long,  the all guns blazing, final act may feel a little drawn out , and theres also very little humour, but there's still plenty to enjoy here and with part 2 already in the works, this could shape up to be a pretty awesome franchise."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,great movie worth seeing outstanding music much needed reboot for superman stop comparing it to other superman movies this one is different in a good way
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Am a big Superman fan. I love the comics and the old movies, and man of steel is the Superman movie I've been waiting for since Returns hit theaters. The movie has some pacing issues, but the action is awsome just like the comics and animated movies."
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"A ponderous and over-reliant on flashbacks first half, followed by an hour of non-stop cgi carnage, pretty much. Still, the film isn't without some merits. It's generally well cast, although the material rarely gives its actors a chance to shine. Henry Cavill makes for a fine Superman, but Michael Shannon's Zod is a lackluster villain. Despite really trying for it, 'Man of Steel' doesn't have the emotional resonance of your better superhero flicks. Worth seeing for some of the spectacle, though."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Warner Brothers listens,Snyder grows up,and The Superman franchise comes out from under the shadow of Reeves.

Man of steel is in a word amazing. Yous should go see it,it is the one movie so far this summer that is worth the money and I am going to say something I never say. If you can get to a 3D or Imax showing see it there because there are some very impressive shots that are just a lot of fun in 3D and I can't imagine how good they would look in Imax,this is the must see movie of the summer. Word of warning to old school Superman fans,don't go in expecting this to have the same feel as Superman the movie(1978),because this film is a completely different animal and that is what makes it so great. Now don't get me wrong Superman the movie is number 5 on my list of all time favorite films so I am not putting it down but this film has nothing to do with that film and is the better for it. There is no denying that Superman Returns was a failure in part because it was so slavish to the 78 film and because of that it really didn't bring anything new to the table. This film creates it's own superman universe and that is what makes it so good.

I don't want to get into the plot because that will spoil it but I will say that Warner Brothers seems to have listened to an addressed every complaint about that movie with Man of Steel. It is origin story but it is one that is pretty much packed with action from the first minute and doesn't let up yet it still takes the time needed to let you get to know the characters.  It is very good looking film and as always Zack Synder brings energy and just a great eye for what looks good on camera. In the past I have have always enjoyed the look of Synder's movies but have found them lacking in the story and character department,well teaming him up with Goyer and Nolen seems to be the best thing that could have happened.  They have come up with a great script that gives all the characters something to do and with Nolen as producer Synder seems to have grown up and this film has a maturity and brains too it that his over movies don't have and I hope he continues to work with this team because his images teamed with a script this good produces something that is just a joy to see on the big screen.

I would just like to say that this movie also features the most mature version of Superman and Lois Lane I have ever seen. They both act like adults,have brains,work well together,and just get along in such a way that they both feel like strong characters who are more complete together. In other words this movie made me care about the love story between the Superhero and his girlfriend and that is something most movies of this type fail to do. So I take my hats off to everyone.

The whole cast is great but I will single out Henry Calvin and Amy Adams for praise since the movie rests on their shoulders and if they didn't work the whole thing would fall apart.

Calvin is great. He plays Superman his own way but feel just like Superman. He is not Reeves but he doesn't have to be because every time he was on screen I believed he was Superman. Superman is one of the hardest characters to play because an actor has to projected a commanding presence,compassion,a sense of joy,and the idea that Superman know how much is riding on him all at once. Then in the scenes with Lois he has to convey that despite being so close to perfect he really does love and need her and Calvin does all of this.

I have to admit I was dead set against Amy Adams as Lois Lane. She seemed wrong for the part to me and I was sure it was stunt casting but let me tell you crow has never tasted so good. She brings everything to the role. She is a hard ass when she needs to be with out becoming unlikable. She clearly cares about people and she has chemistry with Calvin and she never is just standing by and doing nothing or just getting into trouble. You really believe that she is a smart caring woman who Superman could fall in love with but the great thing is she doesn't play it as so many others have as a schoolgirl crush. Both Adams and Calvin play it very real and the movie is all the stronger for it. Even when she wasn't directly involved with Superman's life I found myself caring about her part of the story and that is all down to how well the character was written and just what a great job Adams did playing it so I take my hat off to her.

The action is of course amazing and as I said this is well directed and it is a fun film,you really feel like you have been on a ride at the end. Is it perfect? No but no film can be and this is about as perfect as a super hero film gets so if you can get over the fact that this doesn't continue the Reeves series I say go out and see it now as far as summer blockbusters go this is so much better then what we normally get. 10/10.  

Go see this movie and make it a hit because I want to see where the story goes next!!!!"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Action is good but film longer than needed to be & no need for 3D as it added nothing. Good job it was free as I would've been very disappointed paying extra for the 3D.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Best movie of the summer. Perfect cast and even more perfect Superman
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Just came out of the cinema watching this and I am exhausted! What a film! You all have to watch this! Best action film I have ever seen, seriously you have to keep remembering to breath!"
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Awful! If you go, I warned you."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,above expectation! a must see - Superman as we would expect!! epic
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"i really enjoyed most of thr movie but the last part felt so lost in special effects explosions and cgi that it seemed just like so many other special effects movies i have already seen, the cast was great. and most of the movie was really good up until the last 40 minutes or so and it kind of fell apart for me just reminding me of a dozen other movies with just a lot of special effects, and action tha went on an on. you could have substituted superman in the end and never would have known it was a superman movie. but this is the problem with a lot of movies today, but that is just my feelings..."
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I have no clue what's wrong with all these critics. This movie was inventive, exciting, and a fantastic interpretation."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Bloody brilliant! Another great performance from a Brit playing a yank!!
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"this is a good movie, good acting all way around"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"(5 Stars) It's possible to love both Richard Donner's colorful Superman and Zack Snyder's solemn Man of Steel; they're different takes but both do what they do beautifully. For some, Man of Steel is the Superman movie they have always waited for. I admit fearing it would be overly gritty and dark, being from the director of Watchmen and Christopher Nolan producing, but that anxiety quickly went to rest. I really, really like this film because it has a great cast, inventive action scenes, solid special effects, and it has splashes of Americana (like simple images of children playing in the front yard and hung laundry blowing in the wind) that remind me why Superman is a great American hero.

Henry Cavill's Kal-El isn't like Christopher Reeve, but he's majestic as a new Superman. Imagine the switch in James Bonds, from Pierce Brosnan to Daniel Craig. Both are fine Bond actors but would seem out of place in each other's worlds. Lois Lane (Amy Adams) does way more than most females in superhero movies. Michael Shannon is an ominous General Zod and I swear surrogate parents Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) steal every scene they are in. This is a superb cast.

I'm sure there MUST be something I have to complain about because critics love nitpicking blockbusters to death. Fine, I'll give you a couple... I miss the John Williams soundtrack. To me, the Superman theme and Superman himself are one in the same. And I'm sure everyone shares this one with me: how come the public can't seem to see that Clark Kent is clearly Superman? It's almost a joke in this film.

But I love Man of Steel... as a summer blockbuster, as a graphic novel movie, and as a Superman film. It's unfortunate that some are calling it city-destroying porn. I think it's just that we're fatigued with it since the majority of superhero films end this way. But this film rises above it."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"If you know me you'll know that I am not that big of a Superman fan, before Man of Steel was announced I had no interest in the character. When Man of Steel was announced I was interested because Zack Snyder was directing the film, Christopher Nolan was producing it, and David S. Goyer was writing it. I decided to prepare for Man of Steel by watching all the previous films because I haven't seen them and it turns out that I actually really enjoy the first two films. The third and fourth film are just garbage and Superman Returns was just decent. I actually got really excited for Man of Steel because the trailers looked great, the film had a lot of talent behind the camera, and the film has a fantastic cast. Well ladies and gentlemen, Man of Steel is finally upon us and I have to say that it met my expectations. To me this was just an awesome summer blockbuster but it was also a great superhero film as well. Everything I would want from a superhero film was in this movie and it all worked out very well. Man of Steel is another origin story of Superman and I thought that it was extremely well done, the screenplay by David S. Goyer was just amazing. I thought that this movie told a fantastic story of Superman's origin and was a great first entry of this new Superman series. I even thought that the story in this movie was an improvement from Superman and Superman II. Goyer also manages to put in quite a few emotional scenes in this film, many people may disagree with me on that but I thought all those scenes worked out perfectly. Before this movie came out lots of people were saying that this would be more of a Christopher Nolan movie than a Zack Snyder movie, those people are so wrong because this is definitely a Zack Snyder film. I'm not the biggest Zack Snyder fan but I thought his style worked perfectly for this movie. One thing Snyder did a great job at was pacing the movie, this movie is two and a half hours long but it just flew by for me. Overall I thought Snyder did a really good job. This movie is just absolutely beautiful to look at, Amir Mokri's cinematography is just so beautiful and the visual/special effects are just mind blowing. Lots of people, such as myself, where really disappointed that Superman Returns didn't have that much action; well, Man of Steel definitely makes up for that. There are so many awesome action sequences and they are all done extremely well. Like I said earlier the visual effects are just phenomenal and it just makes the action sequences look amazing. Speaking of amazing you also got Hans Zimmer as the film's composer and his score is just magnificent, every scene had the perfect music going on in the background. Now it's time to talk about the acting. Henry Cavill is the new Superman and I didn't know what to expect because he hasn't done that much acting that I was aware of, I saw him in The Cold Light of Day but that movie was terrible. I can proudly say that Cavill is a fantastic Superman/Clark Kent, I believed that he was both Superman and Clark Kent because he could portray all the emotions of those two characters. He was also physically built for the role. Amy Adams plays Lois Lane and I thought she was great, I believed that she was this determined reporter and she definitely had the look for the role, I mean she's beautiful. Many people say that Lois Lane's and Superman's relationship was rushed but I disagree with that, I thought that Amy Adams and Henry Cavill were great together and had a very good relationship. Every superhero film has to have a great villain and this film has Michael Shannon as General Zod. I thought Shannon was brilliant as General Zod because I thought he was so menacing and I liked his character a lot because his character had a reasonable motive to be the way he is. Russell Crowe is great as Jor-El and Kevin Costner is great as Jonathan Kent, both play great father figures and both are very good in the emotional scenes. Personally this is my favorite Superman movie because it has everything I would want out of a superhero film. Man of Steel is an awesome film and is a film I would highly recommend, you may not love it as much as I did but it's definitely worth checking out. If you do decide to see it than see it in theaters because I can guarantee that it'd be a much better experience than watching it at home."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"I'm not sure what film the critics were watching, but I also don't go into a Superman movie expecting a romantic comedy (which I assume is what some of these reviewers wanted based on their complaints). As a lifelong fan of the character I can honestly, albeit a bit biased, say that Man of Steel delivers the type of Superman movie we have longed to see since the inception of the character. The character portrayals were virtually all spot on, with the exception of Amy Adams as Lois Lane. She did better than I expected, but I still didn't believe she was Lois. She lacked the brash attitude and the chutzpah that has been the iconic marker of her character for 75 years. Cavil as Clark Kent/Kal El/Superman delivered a superb performance. Like Heath Ledger's Joker, there was not a single moment when I thought, ""Hey this guy makes a good Superman."" He IS Superman. As far as weaknesses go, yes the action sequence was long, but what can you expect from superhuman aliens that don't tire like the rest of us mortals? The flashbacks to explain Clark's journey kind of messed with the pacing, but I think given the story they were handled as well they could have been. The only real complaint I had was the kiss shared by Lois and Superman. It felt forced and pointless. Their relationship had developed throughout the film, but not enough to warrant a teenage hormone driven make-out session in the middle of ground zero with all the survivors watching. It was weird. Had it not been for that and Adams' weak Lois Lane, I would have given it 5 stars. As it is, 4 will have to do. Can't wait to see it again!"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Awesome! Critics are out to lunch! I am a loyal comic fan, and yes there were some small changes but it really helped with the story and flow of what Zach Snyder was trying to portray!"
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,WTF who man this bad movie?
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,One of the best superman movies made I loved it I am a huge superman fan I would pay to see it again!!!!!
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,A must see for all ages...WOW!
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Utterly joyless. Superman is the moral compass of the D.C. universe, and his character demands a more optimistic, light-hearted nature. You can't make Superman another Batman and have it work."
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,Disappointed. The movie completely lacks of emotion and depth. It wastes so much time for the pointless fight in the end. Everything in this movie is shallow for me.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie ever...and pretty good movie overall.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Take it for what it is, a God 
like character needs to be over the top!"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Great action and left me excited for a sequel.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Really lots of action. Perfect actor for Superman. Good storyline and I liked the way they took the time to begin at the beginning. Was a ""tad"" long in one part but otherwise great"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Now THATS a Superman movie! I actually care about the character in this one and sympathize with him. Everything they did in this movie was great.
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"the film is good but it has flaws, 
its a film is fill with really deep views about  capitalism vs communism and  a controversial statement that Jesus actually fail save its own people... that is for everyone  that understand  semiotic and rhetorical language in films....  but for general viewers  the film has a lot of flaws, film fail to transmit what the character are going through in many scenes  .. the ideas seems to be there but  film fail to transmit them to the viewer.. is not a film for everyone but the film has more thought put into it than most viewer give it credit for"
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Not a Superman Fan!!!
But, I will see it!!!
Just to See how it is!!!"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"The plot is unbalanced in places and some of the CGI is iffy, but Man of Steel is without a doubt the best Superman film to date."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Snyder has done it again since Watchmen and with a help from Nolan, this was a great re-imagination of Superman introducing to the realistic fashion. The story was good, the performances were decent and the score was astounding! I felt kind of iffy with the ending, but I felt happy with the final result. Man of Steel was just the beginning. This was just the first phase of the DC Cinematic Universe. Justice League is on the way! As much as I thought that Superman with Christopher Reeve was a classic, Man of Steel is a great reboot to the series. As well as Batman Begins and The Amazing Spider-Man. 4/5! 7.5/10!"
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,An ok storyline could have been better. Lots of lens flare. Question is: will there be a sequel or a reboot of a reboot of a reboot? :)
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"New version of the Superman origin story... this one changes things up a bit from the standard telling but sticks enough to the basics. Some good action sequences and the film is generally good. Henry Cavill plays the lead role and while he looks like Superman he is a bit too stiff as an actor and doesn't really have the chemistry with Amy Adams to make the love story spark.. Adams does make an appealing Lois though. While I liked much about the film there was just something a little off about it... part of that was Cavill's performance but the direction seemed off too.. scenes were played at odd angles and editing choices hurt the flow of various moments. Probably too much time was spent on the Kryptonian backstory, while i would have liked a few more moments of his smallville upbringing.  The huge fight at the end destroys most of Metropolis and probably kills millions of people.. but our heroes have time for some romantic moments amid the chaos?  The thing that really bugged me was the final moment between Superman and Zod where our hero makes a choice that is totally against his basic character.  All in all, I did like the movie despite it's flaws."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Ready to see it one more time. Henry Cavill in the Superman uniform.....enough said.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,best movie of the year
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"In terms of Superman movies, this one came out pretty good. While we all know the back story, and we don't need to have it completely retold to us every time, it would have been nice to keep some of the mystery. Parts were a bit cheesy, action was on full throttle, but isn't that how Superman should be?"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,For this version of Superman Man of Steel did a hell of a job it put an extremely new twist on Superman I'd also like to add that for those of you that are old enough to remember Christopher Reeve version of Superman all four  movies go see Man of Steel it's worth it great movie great action
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,this movie is a very good movie i love it i think this is one of my new favorite movies !!!
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"building crushing, debris flying, cars flying, people running, and the more building crushing and collapsing everywhere, hole punched through building... lots lots of them...
Superman looked latinos, very ripped indeed. This is superman that have nothing to do with the comics."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"A powerful, impressive film. The action is so overwhelmingly spectacular, story so compelling, that you'll forget that it's overly serious."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Critics don't know anything go see this movie it is awesome now we have dc movie lift off.... hero's come forward  to build a dc movie universe  we have all been waiting for....justice league any one???
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,A bit more character development needed but overall a very nice film.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Thank you Zack Synder, Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer for delivering a fantastic Superman film that Bryan Singer failed with Superman Returns. Unlike the last film, this focuses more on Superman's origins and far less on the love between him Lois Lane. Amazing action sequences plus great performances by everyone! Hopefully we sequel soon!"
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,I was sorely disappointed with this film. I felt as though it lacked the 'heart' of Superman that made him so great. The excessive amount of male primal screaming aside. The director and producers tried to rectify a lack of plot by bombarding you with too loud and too much special effects.
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,Bon...bah on va aller revoir le Superman de Donner pour la 124ieme fois...
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel is beautifully written and artfully executed. Contrary to the fool's notion of ""lack of fun"", this movie draws out clearly how hope is made - in times of deepest despair. The fighting was essential; what else would Superman do?! Fall in love?! Your average-Joe could do that. Making a movie revolving around that is pure fluff and is not super at all. Man of Steel is exactly what it was meant to be. It was a heart string tugger and to not be able to appreciate such a masterpiece is an embarrassment."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"I really don't understand why this movie is being criticized so badly for not having enough light-hearted humor? I mean come one its Christopher Nolan he produced Dark Night and Inception what exactly are you expecting? This was by far the best Superman movie ever made, it certainly wasn't perfect but the story was good, the graphics were amazing and it just wasn't the same old cheesy superman you are used to which was nice. Go see it."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome origin story
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Slow start but EPIC finish!
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Okay I have a DC bias and superman is one of my favorites....this was one of the best superhero movies I've ever seen!! WOW!!!!
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"a worthy comeback to the first figurine of the DC universe , Snyder delivers and left me pleased with the return on my expectations"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Some of the action gets tiresome, but regardless, Man of Steel is a masterful retelling of the iconic hero. I had a blast."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great movie. A lot of action, a m"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel is flawed, but has some great, memorable aspects to it too. First and foremost, the casting is on spot. The most surprising thing for me was how effective Kevin Costner is as Clark Kent's human father. Watching it made me miss the Kevin Costner of Field of Dreams, and I may have to watch that this weekend now. The relationship between father and son is really, really touching. Russel Crowe as Superman's father is also very effective. Henry Cavill is made to play Superman. He has the looks, of course, the charm, the sensitivity, and in this one, the moodiness to carry it off. The screenplay doesn't allow Henry Cavill to show off all his talents as an actor (and we know he is talented through The Tudors), but I'm looking forward to the sequel where Superman gets to move on from such anguish and put on those quirky glasses as Clark Kent. 

The ending seems to drag on for a bit, even though the CGI effects are stellar. At the end of the day though, the best parts of the movie are the flashbacks to Superman's upbringing in Kansas. They don't happen linearly, but somehow work extremely well and are the most touching and memorable moments of the whole film. I think another critic put it well: The super in Superman isn't too super, but the man in Superman is super."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"A solid performance from all cast members. It's a darker version then the last Superman reboot, but no so much that your kids can't watch it. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The action sequences were long and suspenseful, and it helped reintroduce Clark Kent into becoming Superman. A very good film, and I hope everyone who reads this will go see it."
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,This movie needed a whole lot less disaster porn and a whole lot more of Superman actually representing the hope and inspiration Jor-El kept saying he would represent.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"81%
Man Of Steel provides exhilarating action sequences, brilliant CGI and a dark, brooding performance from Henry Cavill for DC fans and viewers that are maybe unfamiliar with Superman."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,critics are not good in judging this one. :/
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"As a movie, it was excellent. Cavill's portrayal over superman is the best we've seen since Superman 2. However, I am not sure that the tone and atmosphere of the film really captured the Superman that many of us have in our mind's eye as fans. What we have here is an excellent story about the Man of Steel, a creation of this director and this cast. I'm not sure we have a story about Superman."
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,Another Superman movie. A few twists on previous incarnations but more attention paid to destroying the world one Sky Scraper at a time than to explaining questionable pseudo-scientific mythology.
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Pretty enjoyable movie honestly. They took the story in new and interesting directions and overall the acting was solid...oh and the Kryptonians were pretty badass...coulda done a whole movie just with them and I would have been pleased.

Biggest complaint I heard from the audience was that it was too 'sci-fi'...come on now, he's always been a freaking alien! We've just never really thought of him in that way to this degree before."
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Although I enjoyed MOS, it has some flaws. The pacing and rhythm of the film are off, which can lead to some very tedious moments. The relationship between Lois and Clark is also not as developed as it should be, and a lot of the dialogue is hokey and generic, when it should be playful and witty, such as in The Avengers or Iron Man. The action sequences are amazing, and it was great to see Superman actually fighting worthy adversaries.
Henry Cavill does a good job capturing the conflicted spirit of Superman, as he wrestles with his role on earth. All of the actors do a good job, but it needed a better script, and scenes that flowed in a much sharper way. The score was also good, but it wasn't as memorable or uplifting as the original. I was entertained, but I hope they get new people to make the next installment."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Henry Cavill ""Man of Steel"" embodies all of the characteristics that made Tom Welling so successful at playing the same role in ""Smallville."" Cavill demonstrates a great deal of depth and emotion. This movie peels back a lot of layers and tells us parts of the story never seen before. Did anybody see the LexCorp truck or the Wayne Enterprises satellite? Lots of Easter eggs. I might have to watch again to find some more.. :)"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,The best superman movie ever made.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Probably the best Superman movie I've seen, beats the hell out of that crappy reboot a few years back"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Pretty damn cool... Worth it in IMAX
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Slightly baffled by the reviews, this pretty much has everything you'd want in a Superman movie. It benefits from an incredible cast and some stunning action sequences, although I found myself missing Snyder's usual touches. Tonally, there's room for improvement. Seriousness works for Batman, not so much here where the absurdity should be embraced. I hope this kickstarts an exciting franchise."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Justice to the Superman Mythology. Its imperfection constrained by the most super expectations but its beauty lies in the earnest struggle for the Ideal Good. The lack of humour does not for once hamper the masterful performances by the awesome cast. I am definitely looking forward to the next level.
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Mildly entertaining, but lacking in terms of character. This gritty, ""real"" tone may have worked for Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, but Zack Snyder doesn't really seem to understand Superman, his character, or his supporting cast beyond the basic details. If you enjoy loud fights and mass destruction, then you will probably like the film, but as a long-time Superman, I feel that Man of Steel doesn't really capture the idea of the character well and is a stumble as DC's first entry into building a cinematic universe."
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Everyone know how well Nolan's films are made with a humane nature touch for the superhero & interweavings between scenes & characters.Everyone including me loved the Batman series reboot along with Inception & The Prestige,since it's one of kind of Top notch Films made in Hollywood.The trailers provided much hope for me to watch the film,since I believed that it could have a quality like the Nolan's films earlier had.Watching ""Man of Steel"" in First day,First Show,I realized that all the gimmicks thrown out in the Trailer is better to watch than the Original movie.

ie,Trailer is the most comfortable to watch than the whole Movie.In a nutshell,""Man of Steel"" is a Superman movie episode,with Transformers 3_The Dark of Moon climax plot with some expansion of his origin ,with a confusing Nolan Touch.

Most Superhero movies made recently like Ironman-3 & The Avengers are like a regular blockbuster movie with thrilling Special effects,Actions & a simple story thread.I know that with Nolan on Superman side,I could never expect such a thing here & I don't but the product I saw was a totally confusing ,boring as well as Dumbest Film I have seen recently.I  expected the confusing element would be there,there was only confusion & nothing innovative or smarter things are in here.

Bad cinematography as well as confusing editing & bad performance from actors make this movie,you should avoid watching anytime soon.Editing is done in such a way to provide more depth to the movie & it was an utter failure.Cinematography was below average for such a massive budget superhero flick & is very ordinary.

Henry Cavill as the Man of Steel is one of sorry figures of this movie.His presence as the Superman is not convincing enough for me & has a emotionless face everytime you see him.Initial scenes including Russell Crowe provided some thrills & it ended there.Michael Shannon has a rude face from the Beginning to End & I don't know how his performance is praised by some critics as Top Class on other reviews.Amy Adams has a smiling face for major period in the Film & worthless to watch.

Some special effects are worth to watch & it is only thing that Man of Steel can boast of.

I could say Christopher Nolan tried to elevate The SuperMan similar to his Batman series reboot but the end result was that of boring & worst movie you would expect.If you don't know the SuperMan before,you could have some fun but even if you know,you should never leave the eyes & attention of screen .If that happens,you can leave the theatre failing to understand what the hell just happened in front of me.."
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The dialogue was terrible,  and the acting worse. Superman nerds will appreciate the bland superman character,  but as an adult I wouldn't recommend this movie to other adult movie goers"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!! This is everything that I was hoping for in a Superman movie! It's a must see!
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Euphoric. I keep on using that word a lot when describing this film, but that's how I felt while floating out of the theater after the end credits. No matter how divided opinions are in regards to Man of Steel, it is, for my kryptonite, the absolute best film of the year so far, and one of the best {superhero} films I've ever seen. It's an exhilarating and touching sensation--a reminder as to why I love going to the movies in the first place. Flat-out wonderful!"
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Third best Superman.   Great action, very good acting, and good story.  Most see for Superhero fans, and sci-fi fans alike."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Man of Steel is the modern day version of Superman and keeps you intrigued throughout the whole film!
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I took the family to see Man of Steel yesterday.  I enjoyed the film, I thought that the casting was extraordinary.  Overall a very enjoyable film, hopefully setting the stage for a sequel that would allow for the Clark / Lois relationship to play a larger role, and offer more opportunity for humor.  If you are a Superman fan, I don't think you will be disappointed."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"The Superman movie people were waiting for. Great action, beautiful filming, and a non traditional storyline. The movie took the character and story in a serious way which some didn't like and there were some lame moments which didn't detract from the movie too much, but overall a GREAT movie."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"One of the best superhero movies I've ever seen in a while!!! It got the best effects ever with a decent storyline. Superman returns and this is his best time. An enjoyable blockbuster if you don't care about the plot, just let it burn your eyes!!!!"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"As much as you want the past to live on - clear down to your DNA - one must adapt to change.  This concept is the central core of Man of Steel... and quite possibly a message to all the critics who hate this film.  As the applause ripped through the packed theater friday night and I regained my composure all I could think was ""how did this get such bad reviews?"".  Then it dawned on me.  Superman Returns was such a bad movie (My 12 year old son and his friends call it just plain boring) that the standard for another remake are impossibly high.  So the critics want the Donner film to time travel to 2013 and set the DC universe right.  Some of what I read were comments about there being no John Williams score, not enough pithy one liners to make Superman funny and too much CGI.  It ain't 1978 anymore people.  My son and his friends couldn't stop talking about the film all the way home from the theater.  They're breathing the air and feeding off Earth's sun.  The critics are General Zod and they are pissed at Snyder and Nolan for making a few tweeks to adapt to a modern day audience.  But beyond the amazing action and CGI effects is a solid story that I connected to.  Did the Avenger's have a father son story that brought tears to your eyes?  Man of Steel did for me.  Avenger's is supposedly the best ""Super Hero"" film ever made and I don't remember having one single emotional response throughout the entire film.  The Superman origin story is the strongest one of its kind.  It is literally bonded to the baby boomer's collective unconscious's DNA.  When there is a mutation to the story line they get all Zod on us.  But the future rode home in my pick-up last night.  I loved it and so dose everyone else.  Stop trying to destroy it critics.  This is madness!"

"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Too long, too much CGI, and reminded me too much of Matrix Revolutions.  I cant say I didn't enjoy some of it, but 2 1/2 hours with a talented cast and a popular story cannot be all bad.  The lead is ripped and handsome and emotionally dead.  Left me disappointed overall.  Check this video review of it (no spoilers) - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOsb4sVlEFc&feature=player_embedded"
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Exagerada en peleas, los efectos mega chafas,  buena fotograf√≠a, peque√±os destellos de mensaje, movimientos de camara rapidos para hacer sentir ""m√°s emoci√≥n"" un guion que por querer ser original en su forma de narrar la historia al final acaban siendo puras embarradas con poco de mucho, palomera/dominguera, se esperaba much√≠simo m√°s!"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,The power of Superman demands respect and the tone of the movie gives you that. The story telling draws you in emotionally to the film and accurately portrays how Superman would be treated if he existed in today's world. Great film and can't wait to see Superman on the screen again.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Fab fab fab, special effects and music were amazing!"
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Cheeky, cliche, cheap campy sci-fi, disconnected acting, poor dialogue, & tries too hard to be artsy and symbolic. Donner's film may be dated, but it is far superior."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Action packed. Loved the background story addition of Krypton. Excellent cast of actors.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,It's the Superman movie we have been waiting for
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"FInally we were able to see a Superman with true raw power, something akin to his description of being super but something that was never fully realized in previous movies. Cavill makes a wonderful Hero"
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I guess they can't all be like The Dark Knight but this one doesn't even come close.  After seeing the trailers for Man of Steel I was skeptical if one could create a dark, edgy Superman and after watching the new Superman reboot I still am.  Henry Cavill definitely fits the look of Clark Kent/Superman but his portrayal was so stiff that his character has virtually no personality.  However, that might not be entirely his fault as the movie jumps from one overblown CGI sequence to the next with barely any transition in between to get to know these characters.  I was hopeful with such an impressive cast (Russell Crowe, Dianne Lane, Kevin Costner) that there would be enough emotional substance to feel invested in these characters but no such luck.  Unlike the dark knight series which did an amazing job of fleshing out the main characters emotional conflicts and motivations, this movie just resorted its characters to 2D versions of themselves.  I guess since there are so many superman incarnations that came before this one we are just supposed to automatically know how these characters tick, but for a movie that portrayed itself in its trailer as being something deeper than the Richard Donner superman that we have come accustomed to, Zac Snyder really dropped the ball.  I believe that this movie had potential, but since the biggest complaint for Superman Returns was there was too much substance and not enough action, I guess it doesn't surprise me that this movie deteriorated into a 45 minute video game sequence by the end of the movie.  That seems to be the problem with always needing to up the ante for action sequences.  The more time you spend infusing more/better CGI battles than the last super hero movie, the easier it is to just become desensitized to it and stop caring about the movie all together. I have to say that all though Superman Returns was far from perfect, it at least made some bold choices in the storyline that caught my attention and kept me invested (many purists will disagree with me on this one but, SPOILER ALERT FOR SUPERMAN RETURNS, I thought it was an awesome/original choice to have Superman with a bastard child that he didn't even know about).  As far as bold choices for this new Superman, all I can think of is that they choice to give him chest hair this time around.  All in all, I thought this latest installment of Supes was a mess and if they continue with this reboot, which I assume they will, I hope they either take more notes form the dark knight or actually make Nolan direct it instead of just producing it."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Saw Man of Steel last night. Theater was packed  and had to sit in front row. Show was great!  Outstanding special effects, great story.  Russel Crowe was outstanding as Jarel and the man of steel himself lived up to his name emphatically.  Best superman movie to date!"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is the Superman movie the world needs right now....great performances, a well crafted story, and a completely different way of relating an origin story to an audience make this film one to see."
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"no es tan mala pelicula, el caso es que, en vez de ser de superman,  parece mas un remake de ""independence Day"", sii, aquella movie del 94 con will smith ... a pesar de la buena accion me hizo bostezar mas de una vez .."
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Much better than SUPERMAN RETURNS, but lacking any soul. Too much destruction, not enough heart. Too much product placement; there is a fight scene in an IHOP AND SEARS! Really? Not enough Russel Crowe or Kevin Kostner. The movie leaves you with nothing to think about after. A hollow summer popcorn flick."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie was action packed, emotional and fun. A must see, don't listen to the professional critics they are way off on this one."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,It was what I expected of superman good job
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,No better then the last Superman reboot. Great cast but poor writing/story
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Family enjoyed it! Special effects were great, sometimes too much. Cavill did the role justice. Lots of character driven scenes too. And, fights were sometimes a little long and pacing a little slow...its a good balance of fun, superhero and heart."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"what a fantastic movie, it was well written and surprisingly well directed, Henry Cavil was a spectacular Superman he's at Christopher Reeve standards, just like Superman the Movie I think the film is a masterpiece, it was Defiantly worth the wait."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Different view on superman.  Some questionable things but overall fully enjoyed the film Start to finish.
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The effects and storyline were great. It was nice to see superman as a relatable characte. However, the acting needed a lot of work. Many times superman had five (or less) word sentences. The only thing the audience can really percieve about Superman's character is that he likes to help people; nothing more. 
Overall, the movie was interesting and at many times gripping, but the acting brought down its ""wow factor"". it set up a sequal beautifully so viewers can anticipate that."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Best superman movie to date!! Better than the Avengers!
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Fantastic! Loved it! Ignore negative reviews and just judge it for yourself.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is a great movie, don't know why the critics don't like it?, go watch it!"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Don't listen to these movie critics dudes and dudets. 58% rating smh. This movie inspires to look for the good in man kind even through all of it's grey. I would go on to say that this Superman movie is the closest to a relatively realistic story as we're ever going to get. I will give it a B+ overall.
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Plot holes, no romance between the leads, and a Superman who is not all that inspiring.  Some good lines, well-delivered, but they seemed out of context in a disjointed film."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Critics say it's too dark and not like the original films. That's what superman returns tried to accomplish and it wasn't that good. I love the look and feel of man of steel and think it's one of the best, if not the best, superhero movie out there."
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,was too long and more sci-fi than the older superman movies. They changed this too much from the original.
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Worst rendition of a superman origin story ever made... Not to mention... Allergic to air... Really? If you have any appreciation for the superman lineage you should not see this film... Warner Bros goes on to ruin another well known comic story. 

Even as an independent movie this film doesn't have much ground to stand on... Apparently newspaper reporters are also fantastic rock climbers... There isn't much continuity going on here either. And it just so happens that superman and whoever he's fighting keep ending up back right in front of Lois and the gang even having left the atmosphere at Mach speeds several times..."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Let's give a big shout out to Zack Snyder, David Goyer and Chris Nolan for completely crushing it with Man of Steel, SUPER refreshing!!!"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Mixed reviews from the critics, but don't let that stop you - they also gave Fast & Furious 6 a 70% rating :-)  This is Superman like you've never seen him before.  Though it breaks with tradition in many ways, in all the important ones it stays true to its roots, while reimagining Supes for a new audience.  It's big, it's bold, and between gigantic fight scenes that dwarf those in ""The Avengers"" there's enough humanity and warmth to keep things grounded.  An absolute must-see!"
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"With all the badass action sequences, dazzling effects, some strong powerful subtleties    resembling Malick's shots of objects, it can't be helped to spot some cheesiness galore; especially through the dialogue and some scenes with Lois Lane."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Overall I think it was pretty good.  All this talk I keep seeing about not enough character development is ridiculous!  Do they want they movie to be 4 hours long???...then there would be complaints about that.  I give it a thumbs up, just don't go into it with unrealistic expectations."
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"While I would normally consider a superman tale without mention of Lex luthor or Kryptonite or John Williams' score to be blasphemy, this remake of Superman gives an adequate third dimension to the American icon, figuratively and literally. It is a testament to the new generation's developments in special effects and emotional storytelling"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,best Superman movie!
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Critics who did not like Man of Steel would like to see Gary Marshall direct a Superman film. It seems that these critics who are self-proclaimed masters of the film industry think that there's no joy and no fun in Man of Steel. Let me prove them wrong by the following facts:
Fun and Joy Moments in Man of Steel (Warning Spoilers)
1.	Jor-El almost incapacitating General Zod in Krypton during the Prologue (Russell Crowe was in Gladiator mode for the record.)
2.	Superman fights Faura and the Giant Kryptonian in Smallville.
3.	Superman shows enormous strength by flying through and destroying General Zod's world engine.
4.	Superman fights General Zod in Metropolis.
I understand that the critics were seeking more of Superman saving people from accidents and a love story between Clark Kent and Lois Lane but this scenario has been shown already several times in films and television in the past. What lacks from past adaptations would be the side of Superman where he fights villains as strong as he is and what would it look like if it is to be shown in film. This was the demand that people would like to see and Zack Snyder successfully filled that demand. 
If these were not fun and joyful moments then these critics were looking for Princess Diaries!!! 
Imagine what Man of Steel would look like if David Goyer, Chris Nolan and Zack Snyder followed the fun and joy moments these critics are looking for. It would be watching Clark Kent being groomed by Julie Andrews.
Too much? Too Big? Were the fight scenes exaggerated? Obviously, these critics do not know Superman. For your guide, this is how Superman fights his enemies. They crash to buildings in Metropolis. They engage fast power haymaker blows. They fly with such incredible speed... And for the very first time these fight scenes were put to film accurately by Zack Snyder. Have you seen Superman 2 where Superman (Christopher Reeves) battles General Zod (Terence Stamp) and the 2 Kryptonians. See how they fly? A bit awkward isn't it. It's a great film though but the point is Visual Effects in Man of Steel are legit. These improvements are always neglected by critics. They don't even know basic sketching. Instead of giving deserved credit to today's film Visual Artists, they are being neglected just because of an opinion of an incompetent critic who fails to appreciate how far Visual Effects today have improved and developed against visuals in the past. 
Too dark? Critics who did not like Man of Steel just don't get it. This film showed Superman's struggles on what it's like to live, to grow and be like a human being. Unfortunately, these critics are arrogantly in denial that all of us go through the same struggles in life. The fun and joy part of that is how Superman pulled himself up despite the struggles.
Man of Steel is a visually stunning action-packed Superhero film filled with realistic struggles. It's not too much, too big nor too dark. It's simply the best Superman film adaptation we've been all looking forward to see. And as far as the critics who don't, ""they just need to take a leap of faith first. The trust part comes later."""
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It was like Zack Snyder improved himself after ""Sucker Punch"" (2011) by learning from the best of J.J. Abrams's lens flare & Michael Bay's crazy bombing, but it's sad that he didn't learn anything from Christopher Nolan. However, I wowed at some action moves, the world engine, and how they created the epic production design. I'm a big fan of Superman, feeling disappointed by the ""Man of Steel"" story. It's not supposed to have so much more Kal-El than Clark Kent who is the right one to be called Superman. And the way they ruined the secret between Clark & Lois is bad if they want to keep this bittersweet couple in the sequel. To me, this Summer's blockbusters so far sounded like they all were made from a short story, then added illusion pictures to finish as a feature film. ""Man of Steel"" was lucky for this point of my rating because of the brand superhero I love. Henry Cavill was good also."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie, a must see for Superman fans!"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Fantastic film loved it! A fantastic take on my favourite superhero. Really hope they do another one.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,We will be seeing it today!
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,I had a love/hate relationship with this movie. Loved all the action scenes but other parts of the movie had me yawning and wanting to get up and leave.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome fight scenes!
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"As someone who works in a comic book store, I have a lot of discussions with hardcore fan boys on just what is or is not up to snuff. This movie more than delivers on its promise of being the best Superman movie to date."
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It was quiet not what I expected, it was actually a good movie. I'm glad David S. Goyer, and Christopher Nolan wrote the script and thank god Zack Snyder did not wrote it or i would be cursing it."
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"My girlfriend and I received 2 tickets to see this a day before it opened world wide. The film started off ok focusing on Superman's back ground a little more, which was pretty decent. Where it skewed off the rational thought road was when he made it to earth. It seemed as if whomever edited this film just cut and pasted this together. It had an awesome cast or so I thought. There was absolutely no emotion in the characters whatsoever. When Lois Lane and Superman kiss it kind of made you feel like..""why are they kissing?"" Mainly because it didn't build up any connection in the story line. The action sequence in Smallville had to be the only decent fight scene in this movie. The last battle royale at the end was boring. They fly back and forth through building pummeling one another. The flashback sequences made the film lose track as well, if there was something going on that started to build the story up, cut to flashback! I have this 1 1/2 stars just to be generous. If you are a small child or suffer from attention deficit disorder you will love this film!"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Loved it! The best superman of all. Just an awesome movie.
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This is most certainly the Superman movie I've been waiting for. Could have used a few less serious moments from Cavill, and the shaky cam was a bit excessive at times. (see JJ Abrams' ""lens flare"") Overall, a great starting point to a new Superman series."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,This is the Superman movie we've been waiting for! Henry Cavill was born to play Superman. This is a great ride! Go see this movie!
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,The best superman story !
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,It was good- could have been better if the fight scenes (especially the last one) were not so long!
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Great visuals style, sequencing and an a fresh take on retelling an origin already well tred, but grim and not inspiring  It will not make the inner child feel the awe or want of becoming  a superman, nor a man of steel."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Vi esta pel√É?√Ç¬≠cula y estoy impresionado. √É,√Ç¬°La mejor pel√É?cula de superman que jamas he visto!"
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,To many city busting scenes but overall great remake.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"It adds Snyder's darkness into it and adds a bit of Nolan moments in it as well. I know the origin is long, but this gets me hyped for a sequel and Snyder's 300 sequel. And for that, I give it a 4 and a half star rating."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,By far one greatest movies ever.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Ignore the Critics - The Man of Steel Is a Must See!

Personally, I can't stand critics. Screw 'em! If you are a fan of movies, you owe it to yourself to see Man of Steel!

Granted I am a huge fan of Superman, but Man of Steel may very well be the best movie I have ever seen! Considering movies like Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"", Peter Jackson's third installment in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, ""Return of the King"" and Whedon's ""The Avengers"" top that list, that's saying a ton!

What Zack Snyder has done with this film is ""genius""! This is such a grand movie, yet nothing feels forced or exaggerated. Everything is given to you in exactly the right dosage. You aren't force-fed action like in other summer blockbusters. In Man of Steel, the action feels natural as if it is part of a story being told. Imagine that!

The origin story is there, but it isn't too much that it bores you tears and Snyder goes about it all in precisely the right manner through flashbacks. This way, you get the gist of how Clark came to be the man he is, without the movie needing to be longer than it has to.

All the actors/actresses do a fantastic job in their particular roles and help the movie to do what it is supposed to do: tell a story. While I'm still adjusting to a fair-haired Amy Adams in the role of Lois Lane, I can say that I left the theater content with her performance. She really grew on me by the time it was all said and done.

Growing up as a huge Smallville fan, I was convinced that nobody could do the role of Clark justice after Tom Welling. While Brandon Routh fit the role physically in Superman Returns, he was just too stiff and too much of a Christopher Reeves knockoff to leave me satisfied. I'm not saying Reeves was bad in the role (quite the contrary), I just would have preferred it if Routh had brought something he could call his own to the role.

That's where Henry Cavill comes in! The best way I can put his performance is this - he owned the role!

You know how it goes. Often times you've seen an actor or actress star in an iconic role, only to be dissatisfied with the choice after seeing the movie (or perhaps before and after). With Henry Cavill, I can say this, ""Henry Cavill is Superman!""

The whole time while watching the Man of Steel, I felt as if Cavill was truly an outsider from another planet. And, I mean that in the highest regard! Movies are often about the suspension of disbelief and we as moviegoers sometimes need a little push in the right direction. Cavill's performance did that for me. The fact that the guy looks like he trained day and night nonstop tells you all you need to know about his dedication to the role. Kudos Henry!

The special effects didn't hurt either. As far as cutting-edge special effects go, this movie has it in spades! By far the best special effects I've seen in any movie to date...hands down! Better than Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean, Matrix, Avatar or any of the Marvel movies, including The Avengers! Words cannot describe them, particularly the Metropolis battle scene! Truly epic!

Speaking of battles, the fight between Supes and two notorious Kryptonians (formerly seen in another of the Big Blue Boyscout's movies) was in essence, borderline orgasmic!

That battle seen alone was worth the price of the movie's admission!...And Man of Steel still had plenty left in reserve. By the time the movie is finished, you will feel like a Kryptonian who's just learned to adapt to the Earth's yellow sun for the first time! And, I mean that as a compliment!

Let's face it; we don't go to movies about comic book heroes to be bored to death by dialogue. We want action and suspense to go along with a good, relatively fast-paced story. In Man of Steel you get that!

It currently is and will be by summer's end, the biggest and best movie you will see this summer. Mark my words!

So do yourself a favor and don't walk, run to your local movie theater! You need to see this on the big screen. I promise you, you will not leave the theater disappointed! If you do, then you're either dead or worse, a critic! ""Gasp!"""
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Good special effects, but too doggone long. And apparently I'm one of the few that likes Henry Cavill.....I thought he made an excellent Superman."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Very entertaining and maintained a good pace from the beginning till the end.
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Long before the release of Man of Steel, people talked about why marvel superheroes even not being cultural icons like superman were successful, they said they could relate with the marvel heroes, because of their flawed personalities which wasn't the case with DC heroes....they've wanted a more 'human' superman, who has his own issues.....well they've got one with the Man of Steel, here Clarke Kent is learning to be a superhero, rather than being born with his superhero-ness. He's confused whether he is doing the right thing, whether to trust humanity even if humans don't really trust him.....maybe that's what happens when you know you are an alien and all of a sudden you are your worlds' (both earth and krypton in this case) last hope for survival. As far as the pretty controversial end goes (****SPOILER WARNING****) he snapped Zod's neck out of a desperate attempt to save the poor humans who were in danger to be fried by Zod's heat vision...may be any 'human' would have done so to save them and then scream with horror on their face when they realize that they have ended a life. This wasn't just another 'This is a job for superman' adventure it was more of a learning experience for Clarke on his way of becoming the world's greatest superhero. Maybe if there is a sequel to it we will see a more mature and resolved superman, but until then this is what the fans wanted too see - A more 'human' (flawed) superman which they can relate to, so why miss the 'boy scout' superman of the old times all of a sudden?
Personally I think the movie is great, one of the best superhero movies, though it has room for improvements but then again, nothing is perfect."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Surprisingly good, but I didn't totally buy Henry Cavill as Superman. The visuals and cinematography were typical for Zack Snyder, but that isn't a bad thing at all. Amy Adams' performance was also superb."
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This movie was by far my most anticipated film of the year. As a fan of most comic book movies, I feel torn on how to review this film. I just read that the film will make an est 125 million this weekend alone, which will ensure a sequel, and allow me to present an honest critique of the film. This film started strong. We were shown fantastic images of the doomed planet Krypton, and the fierce battle between General Zod and Jer' el. My problem with this film occurred after this fantastic opening. They tried to portray Superman as an angry man who would rather hitch hike than use any of his powers. This was strange to me. They used flash-back sequences to illustrate the origins of his youth. This was done poorly. Whoever edited the film did a poor job, and many scenes were left to die, they went nowhere. Action was great and the fight scene in Smallville was worth the ticket price. I didn't like Mike Shannon as Zod, he did not own the roll. Overall it was decent, but not as great as I had hoped."
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"With me officially being considered ""old"" now all I kept doing in the beginning was reminding myself of watching the Christopher Reeve movies I watched as a child. Huge mistake as you CAN NOT go into this movie doing so! Its so totally different that it will ruin the experience. After I stopped doing so I started to enjoy it. The fighting scenes at the end of the movie are incredible. Although its a bit long, I think the new Superman is very cool and they did a great set up for part 2!  Nothing will ever touch the old school Reeve versions but then again it goes back to me being old and what I grew up with."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,ignore the critics. super movie.
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Man Of Steel, carries lots of hope, heartless hope, emotions, which lack feelings and lots of cgi destructions, which didn't hurt and kill any citizen or people in this movie, it definitely let me down as a DC comics and superman fan, it almost made me believe, Zack Snyder is still not ready as a director to make Justice League or sequel of superman or any super hero movies. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane's disappointed acting and Henry Cavill and Amy Adams are just OK. The only thing which impressed me was Russell Crowe's performance and first 10 mints of the movie, almost made me believe, that first 10 minutes must been directed by some other director, may be Christopher Nolan. I hope it's sequel will be better than this...."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,A stunning Superman origin story.
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Apparently darker and edgier means Superman now has to be a murderer. This movie was boring, badly edited and had scenes from past failed scripts shoe horned into it for no reason. This was disaster porn at it's worst. This was not Superman. It should have been called Hyperion."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,One of the best super hero movies ever!
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of steel spells epic, awesomeness and greatness. This is the Superman movie, we all deserve."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,One of the best super hero movies ever!
"Jun 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Man of Steel...si tuviera que resumir mi reacci√≥n, dir√≠a que es un buen reinicio a la franquicia de Superman, pero...aun as√≠, como pel√≠cula, tiene muchas fallas en el punto de vista cinematogr√°fico. Algunas cosas se sintieron forzadas, el ritmo a veces se perdi√≥ y sobre todo hubo una falta de progresi√≥n en los personajes, en especial de Supeman, hubo un cambio al final de la pel√≠cula trascendental para el personaje, pero fuera de eso, despu√©s de una serie constante y (en ciertos momentos) frustrante de flashbacks, Man of Steel se centr√≥ en gran parte en explosiones, CGI, destrucci√≥n y no tanto en el hombre. Como una ComicBookMovie, es grandiosa. Tiene secuencias de acci√≥n y peleas impresionantes. Sin duda, de lo mejor en el g√©nero. Quiz√°s, el m√°s grande error es que la historia va creciendo mucho pero se queda ah√≠, con multiples finales y sin un Superman que se vea realmente puesto a la deriva tratando de salvar la mayor cantidad de personas (exceptuando a Lois Lane). Finalmente, a√∫n no puedo concebir a Superman siendo el primer super h√©roe en muchos a√±os (no recuerdo cuando fue el ultimo) en MATAR a sangre fr√≠a a su enemigo...simplemente no, ese no es el mensaje que debe mandar el m√°s grande de los h√©roes de c√≥mic.
Espero simplemente que los escritores hayan tomado estas decisiones para poder hacer una buena secuela, sin el peso de repetir el origen del personaje.
Aun as√≠, las actuaciones de los personajes de reparto fueron sobresalientes, siendo el m√°s, Rusell Crowe, dando a un Jor-El impecable, desde mi punto de vista.
Ojal√° y sea un √©xito para que podamos ver en unos a√±os una Liga de la Justicia, WB, por favor...no sean cobardes. Tienen un √©xito en puerta. En √©ste mundo pueden existir todos esos personajes. Mi veredicto: 3.5/5"
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"As with a lot of stuff people love to compare. This isn't the 1978 movie. When I was a kid I loved the CR movie. This superman movie is for this age. When people know more, and expect more. I think the reason some people give it a low score is because they want it to be a CR movie, fun and far fetched. They had that with returns. Now accept that this is a new start. If your planet is dying and you had to send your new born baby to a different world. I don't think it's time for a joke. This is a great movie /start to something special."
"Jun 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This might just be one of the greatest disappointments of the summer.  It's a bummer this movie just focused on pure action, and went out of its way to make sure action is number one, and the story and reason for its being there is just hardly there."
"Jun 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Just like many children of the 1970s, I had a hard time accepting what I saw in the first trailers for ""Man of Steel."" How dare someone come along and try to tell me someone else could be Superman besides Christopher Reeve! I do love those movies with all my heart (yes, even the third and fourth ones), but it's been 35 years since we've really seen a new and truly unique vision of the world's first super hero. As much as I protested, the time had come.

Let's be completely honest going into this review. Both ""Superman Returns"" and ""Smallville"" rested on the concepts made popular in Richard Donner's 1978 movie. For all intents and purposes, ""Superman Returns"" was a direct sequel to ""Superman II."" Brandon Routh completely channeled Christopher Reeve and while Kevin Spacey added his own flare to the role of Lex Luthor, he still fit into the same character mold Gene Hackman created. ""Smallville"" had numerous cameos by the stars of the original films and set designs and music were even used for the hit TV series.

Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) has known since his early childhood that he's endowed with super powers and an orphan from another planet. As he grows into manhood, he begins to drift from one job to another on his journey to discover who he is and why he's here. When the Earth is threatened by an extraterrestrial invader, Clark must embrace his destiny to save mankind from certain doom.

""Man of Steel"" does its very best to stand completely separate from anything done before. There are no glowing crystals, no familiar score, or anything visually reminiscent of the past five films we've seen. The Clark Kent we get here is one drifting around looking for the right opportunity to show himself to the world. He doesn't act clumsy, inept, or na√Øve. Instead, he's a working man who uses his powers when it's absolutely necessary and then disappears afterward. That's really the biggest difference in character portrayal you'll see between the Clark Kent / Superman of Richard Donner's and Zack Snyder's films.

I have to give Director Zack Snyder and writers David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan credit for taking on the responsibility of rebooting the Superman legend. It's a task that could quite frankly destroy a filmmaker's credibility in the world of comic book movies and geekdom. Thankfully, all their hard work paid off with ""Man of Steel.""

Instead of ""Man of Steel"" just being another retread of the character's origin story, it revisits his past and childhood through flashbacks much like Bruce Wayne did in ""Batman Begins."" It isn't mapped out from start to finish like ""Superman The Movie."" This works perfectly for the fast pace Snyder and company chose to take. We're thrown directly into the action in the film and get the backstory as we move along.

Although there are absolutely no direct ties to the 1970s and 1980s ""Superman"" films in terms of the visuals, one could argue that ""Man of Steel"" is an upgraded version of ""Superman II."" There are a couple of definite parallels between the two. General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his army first destroy Smallville, much the way they destroyed the little town in Richard Lester's 1980s classic. They then move on to Metropolis, where Superman dukes it out with Zod's cohorts. 

I also found it interesting that Superman mainly battles two individuals in Smallville. One is the female Faora-Ul (Antje Traue) and the other is an unnamed giant of a being that pummels our hero and tosses him back and forth through the town's streets. Comparisons could be made to Zod's partners-in-crime, Ursa and Non, in ""Superman II."" 

One thing that bothered me throughout the film was a seemingly lack of concern over what sort of havoc and destruction the battles between Superman and the Kryptonians were wreaking on both Smallville and Metropolis. It didn't seem like our super hero was giving much thought to who he might be injuring as he pummeled and pounded through buildings and other objects and they fell to the ground on innocent bystanders. I tried to explain it away in my mind that it was out of his hands and he was just trying to do his best to end the battles quickly with as little collateral damage as possible. All I can think about is a scene in ""Superman II"" where Christopher Reeve is concerned with moving the action away from populated areas so no one is harmed.

Hans Zimmer's score for ""Man of Steel"" fits the movie's somber and explosive tones. However, it never grabs you the way John Williams' iconic theme for ""Superman The Movie"" does. Instead of having a life of its own, it's really used primarily as an accent to what we're seeing on screen.

The CGI and special effects in ""Man of Steel"" are incredible. There were a few scenes on Krypton that still had that animated feel, but this is more than made up for in the incredible action sequences and battles in Smallville and Metropolis. I would almost go as far as to say that the boundaries of human interaction using CGI excelled with this movie. The fight sequences between Superman and Zod literally had me stunned with mouth ajar.

I appreciated all the ties to Christianity screenwriters Goyer and Nolan brought to the film. I think Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster would have been pleased. We're talking about two guys who originally named the super hero's parents Mary and Joseph before they were changed to Jonathan and Martha.

There are a few examples of this. Clark goes to a church to get advice from a priest while an image of Jesus Christ adorns the background. He basically states in one scene he found his calling after 33 years of searching, which was the age of Christ when he began his ministry. In another scene, he asks his earthly father, ""Did God do this to me?"" He didn't question whether God was real, but insinuated that he knew He was there and wanted to know if He gave him his super powers. Of course, we also get the legendary arms outstretched as if he's on the cross as he dives back to the Earth to save mankind.

""Man of Steel"" successfully brings the iconic super hero into the 21st Century. With the relaunch of the entire DC Universe on the printed page, it was the perfect time to take Superman in another direction. It's a great foundation to build on and has a likable and believable actor in Henry Cavill to help carry it along for as many films as he and filmmakers want to make.

"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,I really don't care what critics are saying. This movie was everything I wanted it to be.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Especially fond of the fact that it was more serious than Marvel movies, but less serious than Nolan's Batman. A little Superman existentialism and philosophy mixed perfectly with grade A sci-fi and action."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Rooster really liked it !!
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie was AWESOME! Finally a Superman movie that comes close to nailing the Bullseye! A MUST SEE FOR ALL COMIC FANS
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie yet! Well worth the money opening night.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I was gonna give it One IHOP out of Five, but the IHOP was half-destroyed."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"No matter what all them CRAZY HEADED critics write or think... I was fed up of LEX-LUTHER and after QUEST FOR PEACE a REBOOT was really WHAT WAS NEEDED.
Chris Nolan & Snyder did an awesome job... Russel Crowe, Henry and Shannon were CHARMINGLY Great at WHAT THEY DID on Screen... I'm happy that

Finally.... SUPER MAN IS BACK..."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Much more enjoyable than the last Superman, there was almost too much action as by the end you kind of got lost in it but that's a pretty small complaint to make. It was a much more serious take than older material which is probably why it's getting panned by some critics but make no mistake, it's one of the best superhero movies to come out in the last decade. Better than the Avengers, Better than Spider-Man, on par with Iron Man. It's no Batman though."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"An unparalleled bore, where Snyder wants the spotlight so bad, to show off his style so much that he takes Superman's own film away from him by turning in the most expensive demo reel ever produced....... and did I mention that it cures insomnia."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie had the best superhero action I've ever seen. The story didn't have much depth but I'm ok with that. They can have that in the sequel. This movie delivered what Superman fans have been waiting for. It's obvious that critics hate it but the people love it. I would give this an 8.5/10
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,to hell with the critics... they need to take a time out.  this movie was amazing.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I can see where it might have been good, but it's missing something"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Very entertaining reboot. Crowe and Costner were great. Krypton was amazing.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome special effects!  loved the new Superman

"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is not a review, but I just wanted to say that this movie was very good, really don't understand all the negativity."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Epic Everything I wanted as a 20 year's plus fan of DC comics.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Everything I've ever wanted to see in a Superman movie. The father son connection in all Superman story lines has always been special to me, and they really told it well this time 2x! Saw it in IMAX 3D and it blow me away!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Overall, i enjoyed this movie.  However, I found the camera work to be really shaky.  I got a headache from all the movement.  The story and action was fun.  Cavill plays a great superman."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Definitely a good movie!!  Had the perfect ending, too!!
~Henry Cavill (as Superman) is pretty damn hot!!!   :)"
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Special effects has really improved in comparison with 1978 Superman , but after watching the movie i still feel a gap. And by the way Clark Kent not being all nerdy is just unacceptable or Lois Lane not having that kind of bitchiness anymore."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"If you like movies without any characterization, a barely coherent plot line,  and 1 1/2 hours of buildings being destroyed then this is the movie for you!  Now that Zack Synder has announced he's making a Superman and Batman movie next, we can all wait with bated breathe to see how he destroys Batman in the same way he has destroyed Superman."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Man Of Steel is a big, loud, extravagant sci-fi epic that has a lot to pull off, considering the character has been around for 75 years. This movie wants so bad to be a complete reboot from any past Superman stories, that it kind of forgets that magic quality that makes a Superman story fun. It checks off all the required boxes, (Krypton, Smallville, Daily Planet) but once Clark puts on the cape, I feel he gets lost amongst the, unquestionably, AMAZING set pieces. Making him darker and more realistic is great and all, but I don't think they nailed the whole ""hero's journey"" that a first	 chapter deserves. 
That being said, the cast, the effects, and the music was awesome. I do miss the Red undies, can't help it. Looking forward to what's inevitably going to be a better chapter in the Superman saga."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,just great all together
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,A+ for visual effects but everything else kind was just meh
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,this movie had great action from start to finish. great story line. placed in the perfect order. you will not regret seeing this movie.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Esta es LA PELICULA de Super Man. Por fin hicieron algo bueno con el hombre de acero. No es perfecta, pudo haber profundizado en la vida de Clark y exagera en el uso de la pirotecnia y efectos especiales, pero si eres  fan de esto sera perfecta"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I really liked this one.  if you are a fan of the character, then ignore the critics.  ""Superman"" was my favourite film as a kid and watched it many times...this very is different, but enjoyable.  i could see the imprints from both Nolan & Snyder, but I like both.  Cavill is excellent as Superman, and surprisingly enough, Kevin Costner was one of the highlights.  The VFX were good and I was entertained throughout.  Looked great in 3D.  Check it out for sure!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Yea best movie so far!!!!
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,loved this movie. lots of heart soul and power to it
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,A great plot with a new spin on Superman. It is a little too sci-fi with too much CGI. The CGI disappointed me coming from Christopher Nolan. It did not seem as if his heart was in this film as much as the batman film which he has done.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Man of Steel is no Dark Knight and features many, many faults, but doesn't fall short of thrill, fun, and entertainment all the while updating (albeit in minor capacity) the origins of one of our most cherished and beloved superheroes. 
In terms of superhero flicks, Steel barely sets a bar that keeps it at pace with Marvel. Honestly I enjoyed this equally with the Iron Man films and the Avengers, and loved it so much more than Spider-Man's awful reboot. 
Among the faults Steel carries with a heavy burden is Snyder and Goyer's inability to truly capture a sweeping epic and the gravitas behind the spectacle are merely dazzling images and ingenious concepts with no real substance or real world severity. Case in point is the climax of the film as the world generators gravitational effects are pulled off visually but lacks true consequences (and lack of remorse) to human tragedy and loss of lives. 
Acting was slightly off-key as well that kept me from fully immersing myself into this world. The random and sudden flashbacks laced throughout made the film feel disjointed overall and was constantly pulling me away. With that said, what was shown in these flashbacks however was decent and relevant, but their placement and odd cutting resulted in far less impactful moments than what was desired. 
Some occasional continuity errors and unbelievable events/circumstances were a bit jarring as well. On the plus side, the story and, as mentioned earlier, the concepts of this new Superman were highly ambitious and well executed, such as reimagining the demise of Krytpon, the reasons and impact of Jor-El's decision to jettison his son from a doomed fate, and Zod's backstory and endgame were nice new touches while still being familiar. These elements open many doors to potential sequels and set up various key characters in Superman's mythology that leaves me eager for what's to come. Other small Easter eggs such as Lexcorp and Wayne Enterprises were fun to spot throughout the film. Of course there is Superman himself, whom the filmmakers executed respectfully, and Henry Cavill was downright perfect. Cinematography was top notch and effects were sharp. Last but not least is Hans Zimmer's hope inspiring score which truly encompasses and embodies Superman and heroism. 
Overall, the films story was a shining moment but within that there were obvious mistakes that kept it from achieving its full potential but won't alienate most watchers."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"If you have a 13 year old boy mentality that likes to see things destroyed just for the sake of having things destroyed, you'll probably enjoy the movie.  To me, this felt like a very ambitious undertaking - and it fell quite short.  There was no heart.  There was no real character development.  The movie focused more on the special effects and cinematography rather than developing the infrastructure of the movie.  The sub-plot from Krypton was weak and distorted.  The fight scenes too long and wieldy.  If you enjoyed all the fighting/destruction from Transformers - this felt much like a repeat from that movie.  I almost feel sorry for today's kids if this is going to be the format of movies going forward - all pretty pictures but nothing to sink your whole being into to enjoy."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie by all standards, proving to us all once more why critics don't matter."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,I don't know why the critics didn't like this. I enjoyed it. it isn't the normal Superman story but that didn't mean I didn't enjoy it. bring on the sequel.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Love the movie and I must say our boy pull it off well being Superman.  I think Christopher Reeves would have been proud.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,Had potential but didn't live up to it. Disappointing.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,This was a great movie! Don't know why such poor reviews. Loved every part of it!
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,it was the best movie i have ever seen in my life.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Finally ends the streak of terrible Superman movies. I still don't know if it can beat the original two though. Lots of action and cool scenes. I hope they make a sequel
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I went to see Man of Steel a second time and upped the rating slightly (on a Rotten Tomatoes scale I give it 74%), I still think the second half is TOO busy (though lots of action) and the first half of the film could have been cut about ten mins (loved the Krypton scenes though). Worth a look, but not the best Super Hero flick!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,I don't know what these critics/fan boys are thinking when negatively criticizing man of steel. This is by far the best adaption to the most iconic hero of our time. Henry cavill is superman!!! He and the rest of the cast did an outstanding job on making this masterpiece come to life. It's ridiculous how critics give it a bad score saying that the movie was cgi for the most part but give ironman 3 great reviews when it's basically using the same amount of Cgi if not more.. Ironman 3 was a flop it's embarrassing how Ironman couldn't get the job done and pepper had to take down the bad guy in the end. Never put a women to do a mans job.. Snyder's storytelling was phenomenal with that being said I will gladly spend my hard earned American dollar to watch this movie more then once while in theaters. Movie of the year hands down best hero movie hands down if u do t agree then that's your problem. Suck it critics
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Loved it! A smart, twisty, explosive reboot. DC & Warner Bros have their mojo back!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Thought this was a great reboot of Superman. Don't know why the critics are scoring this one so low. I'd put it right up there with the Dark Night, Iron Man, and the Avengers. Great superhero movie. Henry Cavill played a great superman and Micheal Shannon did an amazing job as General Zod. Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner also didn't disappoint in their roles as superman's father figures. So far the best movie I've seen this year!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Don't believe the critics, I'm not sure what they like to see in a movie, but they got this one wrong... really wrong.  Man of Steel is the Superman movie fans have been waiting for.  If you like super hero movies at all, you owe it to yourself to go see this one."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"While somewhat flawed, Man of Steel delivers on the promise of a Superman movie with more emotional depth, and the super-powered smackdown we've been waiting to see in the modern era.  Zack Snyder and co gave us a Superman that's more relatable and realistic for our time.  It would have benefit from a little more humor, but this is made up for by the cast and their performances

"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Best comic book film ever made.
Not exaggerating. Loved it."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great movie  it had a fresh take on  superman focusing on the whole alien aspect. I loved the story and character of him, even if they didn't focus a whole lot on the substance like in superman returns, and went a little too fast in some parts for my taste. I don't think was as bad as some the critics say and I don't know why they didn't like it. I look forward to any continuations of this series,"
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,Great job with creating the world of krypton.  The characters are well developed and this version of Clark Kent's childhood seems more believable than the other campy versions.  There were a few minor flaws in the story but it was minor.  It has to have serious tone to it otherwise viewers will not take it seriously.  It would just become campy and jolly.   I would save that for the cartoons.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"""There's very little humor or joy in this Superman story.""
You sir, have seen too many Marvel movies. 
Man of Steel it's great. a True DC movie. Emotional, realistic and dark."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A good reboot, with a good reimagining of the character, but not much else."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"So according to Rotten Tomatoes ""Critics"" are saying that Superman Returns (75%) is better than Man of Steel (57%). 

Are you kidding me?!?!  

Man of Steel makes Superman Returns, which already goes down in the Superman history as ""meh...,"" look like a made for ""TV"" movie.

Man of Steel is FANTASTIC!  It reboots this iconic superhero, if not THE most iconic superhero, in an engaging way that makes you see and care for him for the first time as a person.  As the Dark Knight trilogy stripped away the mask and made you root for Bruce Wayne, Man of Steel has you caring for more than the ""S"" and the red cape.

The casting is spot on.  The character development in this first installment of the trilogy is focused exactly where it should be, on the relationships between Kal-El, his Kryptonian parents, his earth parents, Lois Lane, and Zod.  Russel Crowe shines especially as Jor-El.   

The pace of the movie was not frantic.  The critics loved Star Trek Into Darkness and I really like it as well, however, I thought that the negative w/ that movie was that it barely breathed to give you a chance to engage w/ the characters.  Zack Snyder has done an excellent job of balancing the action (perfectly used CGI) and storytelling, which, allowed you to care about the characters and have fun!

So, why the 4.5 stars and not a 5?  My .50 negative is that I am still trying to wrap my brain around the mass destruction of Metropolis.  It's realistic from one point of view and over the top from another.  Could a happy medium been reached?  That is what I'm not sure of yet.

Bottom line, while Marvel will continue to give of us enjoyable popcorn movies that we can laugh too, enjoy, and use as an escape for two hours, Warner Brothers, Nolan, Goyer, and now Snyder give us superhero movies that entertain, engage, and have us thinking about the story & characters long after we have left the cineplex."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,I've seen this movie.WATCH IT TRUST ME. I've been a fan of superman my whole life and the fact that i haven't seen this side of him makes it all the more exiciting. It has visually stunning effects i haven't seen in years.And ZOD is a PERFECT villain for those seeing superman for the very first time.WATCH THIS.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Man of Steel, great acting, special effects, and an interesting look at our American made hero. We get a Sci-Fi Epic and a superhero film."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I liked this movie.  The scenes up until General Zod's appearance seemed jumbled and fast.  However the action scenes were spectacular and Henry Cavill did a great job as Superman.  He was much more serious than previous versions, but I didn't mind.  And while we didn't get a ton of emotional development in the first half of the film, there was enough in the second to balance it out."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,Ok smallville .  Fans hold on Ur Hat the man of still was  a 3 out of 5 stars. Is the Dark night Raises all over again . Why they did Plaguerism
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Best Superman movie by far. The new origin story was refreshing, the flashbacks to Clark growing up were well placed and effective and the fight scenes were great. Don't listen to the Critics on this one!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie does for Clark Kent what ""Batman Begins"" did for Bruce Wayne. Everything about it is a setup for a sequel, which will doubtless be a knockout. That is not to say that this movie wasn't enjoyable. In fact, some of the most dazzling scenes that the big screen has seen in a while combined with the natural, albeit chemistry, between Cavill and Adams, the movie has a charm all of its own. The casting for this movie was impeccable. Russell Crowe has re-defined the role of Jor-El and Michael Shannon embodied Zod and made it clear that he was not your stereotypical tyrannical, power-hungry villain.
The dialogue was lacking, and for most of the movie, simply not present. In fact, I think the movie could have worked just as well as a silent film; Zimmer's score and the acting itself speaking volumes.
Some relationships did not seem as fleshed-out as the movie seemed to want them to be. E.g. Perry White with whoever that girl was as he tried to save her from being crushed after a skyscraper collapsed.

The story this movie told was that of Clark Kent/Kal-El becoming the bridge between humans and Kryptonians as he decides what kind of man he wants to be, under the guidance of his two paternal figures, Jor-El and Jonathan Kent. Besides that, it doesn't do too much n terms of light-heartedness and the angst and romantic tension we've come to expect from adolescent Clark (Smallville) and adult Clark in some of the older Superman films.
All in all, I absolutely recommend this film to any long-term Superman enthusiasts who felt that previous installments in the franchise left them wanting more, and I recommend this movie to anyone else who has any interest in an incredible score and some glorious action scenes."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"It was great!  Dark and serious, but then that is more like the real world we live in now vs the cheery happy go lucky world previous Superman installments were delivered into in the 1980's and before.  I would have liked to see the fight scenes reduced enough to invest that time for more character development of Clark, and romance development with Lois.  After 33 years on Earth, he should not be looking around like he just got dropped off and is still trying to find himself.  Not entirely anyway.

What shined in this film was the cadence of unfolding the story.  Instead of the predictable linear process of baby, boy, teen, adult, hero, this did a great job of getting things going early and mapping his experience back with reflections along the way.  In fairness, this is how most of us think and associate experiences in our lives, so it worked well to tell the story.

What was lacking was the ""why"" would he care for Lois or other humans which didn't get developed due to extended fight scenes that seem to be the ridiculous standard today.

Finally!  Lois (a great investigative reporter) gets to act like one, and knows Clark's secret.  This will help them bond going forward.

I have hopes that the next installment will bring Lex Luthor, and that Clark and Lois will enjoy humor and romance to build out their characters and relationships.  I wouldn't mind if Chris Rock is cast as Jimmy Olsen, and Kevin James as Otis (Luthor's sidekick) to lighten things up now that we have cleared the darker alien introduction hurdles.  As for Lex Luthor casting, I'd LOVE to see it be Michael Fassbender!

Reboot success!  NEXT!!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Great relaunch of Superman. A more realistic and plausible approach to comics number one icon. Definitely on par with the Dark Knight Trilogy. Should in time become the accepted adaptation.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"You wanted him to punch people? You got it. There's plenty of action (a little too much in fact) in the new humorless installment of Superman. So that's not the problem. The cast is all very capable as well. Cavill does in fact make for a great Last Son of Krypton. The music is phenomenal, the special effects amazing. At the end of the day, there are many amazing and wonderful things about this new Superman. The problem? It's so serious and dark (I guess we would say) that any of the light and plucky humor of the Superman I personally love is gone. This is a very different Man of Steel, setting up it's own mythology and character interaction. And honestly in the long-term that may work out just fine. By the end of this first film all the pieces are in place for a franchise I would want to watch more of. But for a first installment, as a stand-alone feature, Man of Steel was just Good for me. I'll still buy it. I'll still be waiting with baited breath for #2. But if I'm being honest, I wanted and expected more."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,I really liked this movie - it's being under rated by the critics. Cavill is the best Superman by far!
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Loaded with special effects and too cheesily dramatic. Also lots of plot holes and pointless scenes that could have been done away with. Chemistry was forced between clark kent and lois lane leading to less than romantic moments. Also did not like the random zooming in which should create a more realistic documentary feel to the film, but the crazy amount of overly dramatic special effects cancelled that. Cinematography was pretty good in some scenes and i liked the score, but that is about it."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"As a testament to Synder's resume, Man of Steel is packed with electrifying special effects and magnetic action scenes. And, perhaps, for the first time, we not only feel the dismal ordeals that Kal-El endures in his attempts to blend-in and earn the trust of earthlings but, the narrative earnestly explores the mere fact that he is, primarily, an alien. Little screen time is, however, allocated to character development, while a larger chunk is apportioned to action. Despite, its few wrinkles, this reboot was largely successful and deserves kudos, as well as a sequel."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome interpretation of the original with a twist. Must see.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Awesome opening deceived me into thinking there was soul in this movie, but the rest was one protracted battle scene. Think a million punches too many and a Superman who lacks the concern for collateral damage that made previous incarnations of this character great."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Writing, acting, story was awful. Too many explosions. Felt like an alien invasion movie that just happened to have superman in it. Very disappointing."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"My first opinion of this movie wasn't good. I went to the midnight showing and there were a group of loud mouth commentators in the back row. Nothing makes me more angry! I went and seen it in IMAX 3D the next night. WOW! I don't think I've changed my opinion more about a movie than this one. Although there are things that still bug me about this movie, I finally walk away satisfied and excited more now than ever for a sequal. I recommend if you're a Superman fan and didn't like it the first time to see it in a different format the second time around. made all the difference to me. plus the. second movie crowd was relatively more  courteous than the first. Don't give up on the Man of Steel!"
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Bland rehash of a well known origin story. A lot of stars standing around waiting for something, anything to happen.  Nolan heavy handedness felt throught film with Bat-noir elements between very, very CGI heavy action scenes. Would rename it ""Man Stuck in Steel if I could. Cavill plays Supes like he's a block of ice. Adams was unconvincing. Crowe did a poor man's Brando. Shannon was the best of the bunch, he had me at times feeling sorry for the character and his cause. 
If this was meant to launch DC film universe ala Marvel; it wasn't a well spent $220 million. Green Lantern, strike one.  Man of Steel, strike two."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"If you ever read a Superman comic, go see this movie!  It is different, but in a good way.  I was waiting for a ""kneel before Zod!"" moment, but instead there was a knock down, drag out fight.  I can hardly wait to see what's next....oh ya...hello JLA!!!!!"
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,Too much Fight scene!! :)
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie, must watch. Look and feel of the movie seems like Superman. Great camera action. Great showing how Superman became. Casting IM not so fond of for some. Overall, worth watching."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Loved it finally got it right
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Super awesome! Very Well done! We finally get more than a glimpse of why Kal El was sent to Earth. A must see summer grand slam!
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This movie was packed with action and high profile actors who all did a good job. There were three things that kept it from greatness. The lack of comic relief, the lack of romance and the non stop -- almost monotonous -- violence for the last third of the movie. I'm really exhausted by directors destroying New York and deciding our superhero stories need to be dark and gritty. There was no chemistry between Lois and Clark. In the end, it ended up good, but not great."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"There's plenty to like in Snyder's hectic, rowdy film. But by the time we reach the bludgeoning excesses of the last half-hour it's hard to shake the sense that this was an opportunity at least partially missed."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Screw fun! This is the first Superman movie that was for mature fans. Like ""campy"" want ""funny""? Rent the Christopher Reeves versions. But there was almost too much Lois Lang. She seemed abit forced."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome reboot of the series.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Man of Steel is the best live action Superman movie out there. It is an original interpretation and explores aspects of Superman that were previously neglected.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,the critics are sucking on kryptonite that's what.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,It was awesome.  If you like Superman this is a good movie.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,This movie was painful to watch.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,A super hero movie that actually has a story attached.  And Zack Snyder is slowly but surely proving that he's the best action director out there.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A mixed bag.  There is a very interesting film lurking around in here, surrounded by what can only be referred to as ""mayhem porn"".  The actors, top to bottom, all do admirable jobs, but the characters seem thinly realized or established (either a script problem or an editing problem).  There's plenty to look at that's jaw-dropping and amazing, but there's precious little to care about.  I would say see it, but then go back and revisited the elegant and graceful 1978 masterpiece.  That's the Superman movie to see!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,The technology paradigm that Man of Steel offers is magnificent. what's Star Wars?
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I think half the critics and ""attendees"" have been paid to put out negative press for this film because the competition is truly scared! The acting is brilliant, action is stellar, story is fantastic and topical and Cavill is  badass Superman with tons of heart!! Decide for yourself my friends, this meter is way off true calibration in my opinion...can't wait to see it again!!!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"This Superman was much more complex than previous iterations. He was very human and we were able to see a Superman who had weaknesses other than kryptonite. This version of Superman remains very true to the Superman we all know and love and yet, Christopher Nolan and Zach Snyder completely made it all their own.

I felt like a kid and that doesn't happen to me often."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Loved Richard Donners movies and loved this one best reboot since Star Trek.  A must see this summer i missed the Superman theme but not till the end.  Good story great cast.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Popcorn film, enjoyable, dazzling but just not moving. Will lay a good foundation for films in the future, however."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Had some slow parts, but overall a great movie."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,I...... had issues ....
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Saw the movie with a horde of late night Superman enthusiasts at an IMAX 3D in Lisle, Il.last night at midnight.  The movie was AWESOME and Henry Cavill is the right man for the 21st century Man of Steel. The supporting cast is a who's who of A-listers and Michael Shannon was an inspired choice for General Zod. No great superhero movie works without a great villian, and Shannon's Zod fills the bill.  Amy Adams is a beautiful and intelligent Lois Lane, who,is sadly under-utilized in this action blockbuster. But, the table is set for the next course when the inevitable sequel comes out in (my guess) less than two years. This is a marvelous retelling(make that reimagining) of the Superman origin story and Russel Crowe as Jor-El is another bit of inspired casting. Don't walk - run to see this movie. It is fantastic!!!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Just awesome! My son and I loved it!
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Casting d'exception, action et emotion sont au rendez-vous. Bemol sur le trop plein de destruction dans la finale. La facture va a qui ? ;-)"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,4 stars for very well done and drawn out. Choosing humans over his own people. No last star for the SPOILER!! thing that Superman would have never done.  very well played.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,The best superhero movie ever made hands down!!!!!
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,I was raised on Superman and this movie was pure garbage!!! ESPECIALLY towards the? end!!!!!! as a TRUE superman fan this movie was garbage..Superman would never do what he did.... PERIOD
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,So so so so perfect !!! 100% =) !!! Awesome Day !!!
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,this was a good Superman movie! better than Superman Returns! don't believe the 56% from critics!
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Zack Snyder's Man Of Steel,is very much a summer blockbuster in every sense,but does that make it a good film?Sometime's a film can get lost in all the explosion's and fighting,Man Of Steel,stays right on the edge of that cliff.While bye far the best Superman to date (that's not saying much) I feel with Nolan's Dark Knight series that he started this dark age of comic films,comic films over the last couple of years have tried to darker some work (Batman) some do not (Spiderman) but Superman does.While not in the same league as Batman,Spider-man,Avengers, or Iron Man,Man Of Steel is a huge leap in the right direction.While I still feel 300 is Snyder's best film,this come's a close second.Great acting,special effects,I am really curious to see where they take the series after this..."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I saw Man of Steel at a midnight showing last night. As the credits began to roll, a friend turned to me and asked me what I thought of the movie. All I could say was, ""I'm still processing,"" and as I sit down to write this review, I still feel the same way. Christopher Nolan, director of The Dark Knight trilogy, certainly had his hand in making this film. I absolutely love his Batman films, and there were several themes from that trilogy that certainly carried over to this movie. This movie was very existential, or at least it was when something was not exploding on screen.

This is Superman's origin story, and a lot of Clark's emotional struggles centered around who he is and why he is here on earth. The theme that I could find in this film is that the choices we make define who we are. Jonathan Kent tells his son at one point, ""One day, you're going to have to make a choice. You have to decide what kind of man you want to grow up to be."" Or, as Clark's good friend Bruce would say, ""It's what we do that defines us.""

The problem with Man of Steel, however, is that as soon as the explosions start, the themes and character development go crashing down in flames.

There are two sides to Superman. One is Kal-El-Superman-the alien who uses his extraordinary abilities to save the world. The other is Clark Kent, a farm boy from Kansas who struggles to fit into society and find his place in the world. There are scattered but poignant flashbacks to his childhood in the first act of the movie that focus on Clark's turmoil growing up as he works to gain control over his powers and keep them hidden from the citizens of Smallville. As an adult, Clark still struggles to fit into society, highlighted by the fact that he is basically a drifter, moving from town to town in order to keep his abilities a secret.

Anyone who has been through adolescence can relate in part to Clark's struggles and angst as he tries to find his place in the world. These were the most moving scenes in the film, as they focus on Clark the man, instead of Kal-El the alien. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane were superb as Jonathan and Martha Kent, loving parents who fiercely protect and encourage their son. The scene with the tornado was incredibly powerful, in which Jonathan Kent makes a choice that defines his life, and should set up the choices that Clark makes later in his life.

The problem is that as soon as the action starts and General Zod comes to earth, all of character development set up for Clark earlier in the film evaporates. The flashbacks and the scene with Jonathan Kent set up Clark's inner conflict and the choices that he will have to make later in the film. In the final act, however, Kal-El takes center stage and, pardon the pun, alienates the audience because all of the action drowned out Clark's inner conflict. Besides the explosions (have I mentioned how many explosions and fight scenes there were? I thought I had stumbled into a Michael Bay movie, which is never a good sign), this was my main problem with Man of Steel. Kal-El lifts cars and leaps buildings in a single bound, but he is propelled through the final act (and through about twenty buildings) by General Zod. He never takes action. He is always on the defensive and reacting to the actions of the villain. He does not make choices. He reacts to the choices of others.

I thought that the flashbacks were great. Amy Adams as spunky Lois Lane was great, and I love that this intelligent woman was the one who tracked down Clark. But as soon as Snyder decided to focus on Kal-El and epic battles between aliens, he lost me as a viewer. While I was invested in Clark's story, as soon as that vanished, I was pretty done with the movie. I went into the film hoping that the idea of Superman as an ideal, as the boyscout to Batman's brooding badass, would be shaken up a little bit. I hoped that they would focus more on Clark Kent, the human side to the man of steel, just enough so that the viewer could have empathy for the character and his situation as he struggles and grows. Instead, Zack Snyder gave us a convoluted film that tries to uphold Superman as an ideal, but is never fully able to reconcile the human and alien sides of Superman."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,This movie was terrible.  It would have been better if Jim Carey was playing Superman and it was renamed Dumb and Dumber.  Just terrible.  Worst superhero movie I have ever seen.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,The BEST SUPERMAN movie of the CENTURY ! very realistic. ! critics GO HOME! for d kind of movie ul seem to want i think the cartoon will do just fine!.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Simply extraordinary.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,I don't know why this was criticized so harshly but it was a fantastic movie. It was overblown as being all about explosions but the best scenes were conversations. For any superman or comic book hero fan this was an excellent story played out by a great cast. I plan on seeing it at least 1 more time in theaters.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Shaky camera, undeveloped characters, plot problems, some scenes should have been directed and written in a better way like the tornado scene and the final scene with Supes and Zod, not enough chemistry between Kal and Loise, and we can go on... but who cares the movie is AWESOME! FLY AWAY CAVILL TO THE SEQUEL.. PLEASE!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Forget what the critics say and formulate your own opinion. Go see it.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Very Good Action movie.  They got it right this time.  This movie is far better than you can imagine and worth every dollar, a must see for the summer but do not pay for 3D.  It is a bit long, 2:28 run time, and not for small kind...so don't bring them.  Go out and enjoy Man of Steel."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Aside from strange dialogue at times this movie is exactly what the modern era needs in a superman movie. The fact that Spider-Man 3 has a higher rating than this movie however makes me wonder if there is hope for the world of critics.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"The new film about one of, if not, the most famous superheroe of all the World. Man of Steel is a thrilling experience, Director Zack Snyder takes an interesting trip into the mind of the Man of Steel, one that will make you both laugh and cry over the situations that this ""Not So Super"" Superman must deal with... also the fighting sequences will surely blow your mind."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"""Man of Steel"" was a mix of the matrix, the avengers, avatar, alien, etc. the CGI was overpowering, and it missed several key details from the original ""Superman."" Many things were changed and it was mostly pointless fight sequences. It had some cool ideas, but overall was a disappointment."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed the movie very much, the fights were incredible."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Fantastic movie. Really lays the foundation for future man of steel movies to come.  This ""lack of story line"" garbage is ridiculous.  Or the ""too much action"" non-sense. That's like saying, ""it's just too much fun."""
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Omg, this was the superman movie we needed. Thank you for making it, please go see it   :-)"
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,Maybe I went with the wrong hat on. Christopher Reeve can rest in peace knowing that yet another remake has performed poorly and is presented in a bad manner for all film buffs.  Over complicated and a story line that doesn't fit within the ideal that is Superman.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome ground work for the future. A solid beginning fitting for the man of steel..
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,The most boring movie I have seen in a very very long time
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"honestly to everyone who is saying that their is to much action, why the hell is he called superman then? that would be the most boring movie ever. ""but i wanted a more joyful superman and i didnt like the fighting"". STFU! Zach Snyder killed it!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Despite some sometimes awkward pacing Man of Steel delivers an epic heartfelt story that will both make your eyes tear up and get your adrenaline pumping. The biggest downside is the inability to truly gauge the leading man's performance. Despite being a film centered on and around Superman, the adult superman has surprisingly few scenes where he actually has engaging and long conversations. Instead the majority of the character developing scenes and emotional monologues are usually shown in flashbacks of Clark/Kal-el's youth. Despite this the film has a very serious and emotional tone that oddly couples well with the raw brute force of the sometimes over the top action scenes."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"The critics are trying too hard to be relevant. This is a fantastic and fun movie that is everything it is supposed to be for a superhero movie. Go watch, ignore the reviews of others that are trying too hard."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I enjoyed the ""very"" alien and sci-fi aspects of the Kryptonians in this film. It was quite refreshing to watch. But this movie had too many problems. Henry Cavill is a great choice for Superman but it's a shame he didn't have more dialogue. The main problem for me in this film was the very obnoxious action, especially in the last hour of the film, and when combined with Zimmer's overbearing score it was an ear sore just as much as an eye sore. Don't even get me started on the product placements in this film. Without spoiling too much, there is a scene in the film where Cavill's Superman is battling a Kryptonian in an IHOP restaurant. It was actually quite laughable in my opinion and it really took me out of the film. IHOP, 7-Eleven, and Sears are the main offenders in this regard, but I believe Nokia and Budweiser placements can still be seen. There are still a good amount of positives in the film, I especially enjoyed Crowe's Jor-El portrayel as well as Traue's Faora, but this film should have been much better than it was. The childhood days of Cavill's Superman are told in flashbacks throughout the film. I'm not a huge fan of this type of storytelling and unfortunately the flashbacks hurt this film more than helping it. Not to mention the flashbacks were shown in a nonlinear format throughout most of the film. Give this movie a watch and decide for yourself. Man of Steel should still be seen on the silver screen."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I think that this movie got such bad reviews from critics because it was revamped and told from a different angle. Most die hard superman fans weren't used to this but it had to be done after superman being botched and messed up so many times before that they had to be original and make changes, change minor details, and give you something very different than you have already seen before. I went in not really feeling either way about this movie but it was really good!!!! Where some people didn't like the flashes back and fourth through the story and the high to low intensity scene to scene I thought it was very interesting filmmaking and it kept me interested the whole time! Awesome action, back story and best played superman hands down!!!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Superb,  brilliant Fantastic.   Loved it!!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,I just want to see Superman punch something... and he does.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great movie!! Amazing cast, best Superman movie yet!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Anybody that writes a negative review for this movie deserves to be dragged out into the street and shot!
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I don't get all the negative reviews, this movie is awesome"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I liked it, i wanted to see superman just let loose and thats what you get, villains that can take it and dish it out, equaling an epic and destructive fight, like you'd expect. its hard to relate to kal, unless your an alien trying to fit in to society, but you understand why he hides himself. the smallville and krypton scenes are great, its not hard to see where zod is coming from either. for me its not perfect but it pretty good and what i wanted, its no dark knight but its within my range"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,There is more of Krypton &  more of Superman as a young boy.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"It was an amazing movie made to recreate Superman for this generation.

The bash from critics is understandable, but I don't agree with it. I still think that many people have put the Donner's movies on a pedestal and believe that Superman is that, when the character mythos has changed a lot over the years.

This movies talks about what is to wear the blue and how do you become Superman. Its's the building of a character. The dialogue is not the strong point I agree, but it makes sense since all the humans in the film are merelt the scenery from what happens with Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) and his turn into Kal-El and fianlly into Superman.

The relationship between Lois (Amy Adams) and Kal-El is not without chemistry at all. It's real as it gets, people tned to forget that Clark was always an outcast, unable to maintain relationships and trust with anyone besides his adoptive parentes Jonathan Kent (Costner) and Martha Kent (Lane). So they way they build up the trust and go step-by-step with the relation between Lois and Clark it's pretty believable from the standpoint that he doesn't know how to do it.

In therms of rhythm, the film is long, but it's packed with action, way higher than a Transformers movie. It's fast, but you can understand everything that goes on the screen thanks to the character being people and not machines. I think the action was amazingly well done and we have to congratulate Snyder for being able give us so much.

I know lot's of people my don't like it. It's a film that you can nitpick if you want, but it was better done than Avengers or even TDKR (the first one loses itself in humour when should have drama and the second is a huge plot hole). Superman is by far the hardest character to work from the comics. He has a look on us like a god and questions himself constantly: ""Should I act? Should I don't? What will happen with humanity if they get dependant on me?"" and that questioning is exactly what makes him a character hard to relate and a protagonist, because he is infinitely better than us in every aspect. Because of that he is a very interesting and different character that well portraied by Henry Cavill. He hid an excellent job of making a Superman for this generation and I won't even compare to Reeve, since the type of character was completely different.

The film is great. In the same way that Batman Begins changed how we perceived Batman on the movies, Man of Steel does the same. What they make from that can become the greatest  odissey on the genre that ever happened, as good as the way Nolan made the Batman trilogy about crime-and-mob (pre-TDKR).

Worth every cent."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"this is what happens when you get over ambitious with a super hero subject. Nolan and Goyer got it right with Bruce Wayne....but Clark Kent sore a way too high. A simple good versus evil plot, ofcourse Superman does not provide you with much if plot progression. A drastically failed attempt of fitting a Batman like skeleton, in terms of plot development and motive justification into Superman. Apart from amazing special effects....nothing more lives up to the expectation. thoroughly disappointed."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Good, not great. But better than the last attempt."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,epic space opera. great.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Pretty good though some actions scenes were a bit much. If there is a sequel I will hope for some more character development and hopefully a suburb villain fitting a Superman.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Man of Steel delivered everything I expected from a modernized Superman story, and even threw in some surprises. Zack Snyder's influence on  the film is felt heavily, however, as Krypton looks to me like a location from his previous snore-fest, Sucker-Punch, as well as the ""look at the camera zoom in on the action"" shots. Some CGI shots look great, such as Zod's weapons and ships; while others I couldn't get into, like the animal life on Krypton. Cavill does an incredible job as Superman, having his mannerisms down to a T. I was very impressed by Shannon, Fishburne, and several other cast members; they made the setting truly believable! I wish they had spent a bit more time developing Clark when he was younger. His farm-boy morals that we're familiar with are hardly touched upon. While some action drags on, none of it felt unnecessary to me. Every scene seemed to serve a purpose and overall, the film is very fun and exciting. I will definitely be seeing it again."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Man of Steel had great action and emotions throughout the whole movie but was nothing like the old Superman movies as it didnt have the same light heartedness. But if merited as its own movie I think it was a success.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Superman is all about hope! Birthright story arc(adapted in Man of Steel) is very exceptional and intelligently scripted but the overwhelming impression I get from Man of Steel, the latest cinematic reboot of Superman's origin story is that someone, somewhere along the line, thought that the core concept of Superman needed to be souped up: made edgier, darker, grittier, more violent, more explosive. Every change in Man of Steel serves that end rather than the story, or even a plausible reboot of the character and continuity.
I was hoping that Man of Steel can kick Marvel's Ass but here we see something different, something completely unacceptable and shitty after Donner/Lester Saga, 1996 animated series, Smallville and that cheezy episode by Bryan Singer(Superman Returns). This is a second-tier, third generation Nolan - Goyer flavored neo superhero material. It's really hard to make a good Superman movie. The bar is high, and well-established: Richard Donner's 1979 Superman the Movie and its 1981 follow-up have, thus far, proven timelessly definitive in a way no other Superman film has been able to touch.

It's worth noting that there are lots of superhero characters who grit up well. Batman is one of them: He's a fundamentally dark character with a dark premise, a man whose humanity has been utterly subsumed by his mission. Grim and gritty are part of the Batman base set. But apply the same formula to Superman, and he stops being Superman in any of the ways that matter.
Superman is about hope. Superman's all about finding-or, in its absence, being-the light in the darkness. He's the hero the other heroes look up to, not for his superior power set but for his unflagging decency and compassion. And-the best, most definitive Superman stories are about his humanity and here is the story where Superman Kills people. This isn't to say that it's impossible to tell a dark Superman story but it take more nuance than standard grim and gritty surface treatment. Superman straight-up kills a guy in Man of Steel. He also pretty much commits genocide, or at least heavily and knowingly does it during the third act, but its not more significant than -spoiler-snapping the neck of his Kryptonian nemesis, General Zod.
I was expecting this from Nolan, like all film makers he and his trusty screenwriter bound themselves within their limits, but its completely on Snyder's shoulders. He is all flash and no substance. This is the guy who felt the need to add rape to a Frank Miller story, and played Rorschach in Watchmen as an unambiguous antihero. (I'm not even going to touch Sucker Punch.) And somebody decided it was a good idea to give him Superman.
Well they got what ordered,spectacle and gore at the cost of resonance. Superman's father, peaceful scientist and politician Jor-El, is replaced with a dragon riding, gunslinging badass who can outgun trained soldiers, and the destruction of Krypton takes a distant backseat to Zod's abortive, nonsense rebellion. Superman's adoptive Earth-Dad, Jonathan Kent, changes just as dramatically. Remember the dad who was proud of Clark no matter what, who coached him on being a good person and true to who he was, Remember how crushing it was when he died, and how significant it was that he died of a heart attack-the one thing his son couldn't have saved him from no matter how hard he could hit or how fast he could fly? SUCKER. Heart attacks are for chumps. Spoiler: in Man of Steel, Jonathan Kent is killed by a suitably cinematic tornado, twenty feet from his adopted son, who simply stands by and watches. Why doesn't Clark save him? Pa tells him not to, because people are looking.
And still, all of that might be forgivable if Man of Steel were otherwise a well-made movie. It's not. In the rush to make everything exciting, Snyder has forgotten to make it interesting. The fight scenes were so long that I stopped caring who won-I just wanted them to be over. Ditto, lovingly-shot sequences of Superman flying, and then changing the position of his arms, and then flying some more, and then flying toward the camera, and then flying past the camera, and then flying toward the camera again.
The film lacks the very things we expect from a Superman film, especially one telling his mythic origin. ¬†There is no joy, no sense of discovery, no sense of wonder or hope. The film is so plot-heavy that is lacks basic character interaction, leaving only big-scale spectacle which can only be enjoyed if one turns off their moral compass.
The First act starts strong enough, with a Crowe in Krypton looks like he is been completely wasted, the film gets choppy and unfocused for the rest of its running time as nonlinear flashbacks of Clark's childhood are intermixed with present-day journeys which leads directly into a third act that takes up the entire second half of the film. ¬†The flashbacks themselves are fine and occasionally moving, as Diane Lane and Kevin Costner make a terrific Ma and Pa Kent (kudos for keeping Ma Kent at the center of the story throughout), but the flashbacks seem randomly inserted into the film, with no rhyme or reason.
David Goyer's screenplay lacks a genuine second act, a middle portion where the choices of the first act pay off as lessons are learned that give way to the finale. ¬†The movie goes straight from introduction to protracted action climax. There is shockingly little actual character interaction, with much of the dialogue occurring in the form of thematic monologue by either Clark himself or his two fathers and his would-be nemesis General Zod.
The acting is fine among the large cast, Henry Cavill makes a frankly terrific Clark Kent/Superman when the film actually lets him act. ¬†But this is a a film almost completely lacking in scenes where characters actually talk to each other. ¬†The emphasis is on over-complicated plot. They totally wasted the Birthright Storyarc!
I take no joy in expressing disappointment in a film like this. I grew up as a DC Comics fan and have wanted another great Superman film for as long as I can remember. ¬†I am a fan of both producer Chris Nolan and director Zack Snyder, so it gives me no satisfaction to see them so painfully botch what should have been an easy win for the unlikely duo (screenwriter David Goyer is hit-and-miss). As far as superhero films go, Man of Steel is the most unexpectedly disappointing big-scale superhero film since, well, Superman Returns. It doesn't soar but rather crashes to the Earth like a lead balloon."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,awesome awesome awesome
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie special effects are outstanding, good story a must see"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I predicted that Man of Steel was going to be movie of the year and I believe that the movie does live up to that. With that said, there were a few parts in this movie that I felt could have been better. Zack Snyder is not necessarily my favorite director. I feel that he does a wonderful job accurately (or close to it) depicts fighting sequences the way they are or could be with right portion of destruction, explosive, etc of which he does very well in this movie. Some claim that there was an over kill of cgi used but honestly think about it how are you not going to use CGI with Superman and General Zod and crew? I mean these people are from a different planet and do things that normal humans can't. Also depicting skyscrappers and parking garages falling just isn't going to happen with a real life event so to those people you are just looking to pick a fight (seriously the movie needed to play out in the city that is where the Supermans are filmed so the need for what Zack did with CGI wasn't overkill it was necessary). The only thing that really drove me up the wall was the lack of what Zack isn't so good at and that to me is connecting the audience on a deeper level. I felt that the wisdom from Christopher Nolan was seen throughout the movie to try and give it the dark feeling of which all of us can relate. I know the main early theme of this movie is to connect us to how at one point most of us are just trying to find our place and the individual scenes of Clark finding his ships, his childhood, etc. was a great approach. However Zack was poor at executing it. What I mean by that is I felt we would have a stronger sense of connection and plot line if we went in a more linear line of events from Clark's birth to the fighting with Zod, However Zack's plot was all over the place with his flash backs. I am not saying this approach is undo able for a good movie but this one plays out with flash back from different times. The main plot line is with Clark as an adult trying to figure out who he is and Zack gives us doses of his childhood on earth and small segements of the fighting that occured back home. He also lays it on thick which makes it difficult to feel attached to the movie or emotion/connection with Clark because the scenes keep changing and are unable to build up. Overall don't miss this movie I felt that the approach could have been better but the plot itself was good and Zack did a good balance of fighting, introduction, etc that he needed to bring this franchise back onto its feet."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Man of Steel sucked ass, over hyped movie with poor special effects and and even worse story line which was not even put in a coherent time line. It felt like the movie was rushed and they tried cramming to much in one movie. The acting fell short and felt like I was watching a soap opera. You have failed yet again DC/WB the only good product you have produced was Nolans Batman series. Blah...."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel is at times a story about a kid that learns there are consequences to being different. At times it is a spectacle of unimaginable feats of superhuman ability. Sometimes it's even about a guy in blue spandex and a cape fitting in with humanity and falling in love. None of these stands particularly well on it's own, but together they form an interesting, if sloppy, feast for the senses that is enjoyable, and even fun now and again. Also, Faora is a badass."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,I dont know whats going on with these negative reviews I'm starting to question if myself and others were watching the same movie I thought this movie was great best superman movie I have ever seen returns was awful and the others are either dated or terrible I personally thought this movie was great from beginning to end I feel whether your a fan of superman super hero movies or just film in general you will enjoy this movie
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Everything I was hoping for! Very good back story and lots of action. Henry Cavill does a wonderful job giving Clark/Kal-El human emotions while trying to figure out who he is and why he's here. Russell Crowe (Jor-El) and Kevin Costner (Jonathan Kent) both do tremendous jobs as his two fathers, and for the first time I liked Lois Lane (Amy Adams). I just don't think that Michael Shannon fit as Zod though."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the critics, it was great"
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,Tons of action and great casting.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"In Family guy, there's an on going skit about Peter Griffen fighting a Chicken that lasts half the episode and half way through you're like ""damn it, just kill him already!"" That's what this movie felt like.....
Cool effects but there came a point were it was an over kill. The story telling was off, acting was off - it was hard for me to really connect with any of the characters."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The story progressed too rushly in many points while the last half was nothing but explosion.
The good side of this movie was its concept and theme, which feel some smell of Christopher Nolan."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,different from usual superman movies but good nonetheless
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"The Best of the Best!!!
Es el mejor Superman de la historia"
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"It just goes to show how greedy movie audiences have become these days, that they can't at least appreciate the efforts made in this adaptation of superman. Could it have been better? YES."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it. However my review is biased as I am a huge superman fan. I think there were alot of plot holes and rushed sequences as well as some long drawn out fighting that got me checking my watch. Overall it was entertaining but I recommend avoiding the 3D...just seemed like a waste of useless floating crap.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Though highly entertaining, the movie fell below expectations.  A few cases of plot stupidity and a pace even superman would have a hard time keeping up with."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I had little hope for this movie, but man this movie rock!!!"
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"If you utter the words Superman, Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan you expect a feast of a film. However, unfortunately Man of Steel despite the hype and the positive critics reviews failed to hit the right spot. The film is very choppy and attempted to cover too much ground at once which meant the film was all over the place and sometimes was difficult to follow or stick with. One minute you were one place then in the past and then in the future. It got the stage where the story went out the window and the main focus was on the fights and the trail of destruction. The film did not bring anything new to table and it could be argued it was very much a parody of some other Superhero movies such as the smash hit, The Avengers or the more recent Iron Man 3. Particular elements of the film do have close similarities with these films but I will not name them as it will spoil the film for cinema-goers. There is no doubt this is a big budget, CGI filled event but it was the latter than ruined the overall feel and tone of the film. The CGI was too intense and like other superhero films such as The Amazing Spiderman, the overuse of CGI spoiled the film. Yes people will say 'well how do expect superman to fly or show superhuman abilities? Simple mix CGI with some stunt work. Its not fair to say the CGI was poor but in some action scenes such as Superman flying between buildings, the movement and the body design did look particularly ropey and cheap. Apart from that the cast was solid. Stand out performances would have to go to Michael Shannon, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane and Laurence Fishburne. As for the lead, I did not really connect with Cavill's interpretation of the role. He was very wooden and too serious all through the film. He was desperate to appear human but did not show enough depth in his human qualities and emotions. The film is not necessarily bad it is just an average reboot. I am not saying don't go and see it, go for the the experience but it is not the most amazing Superman film to date. There are talks of a sequel leading to a possible trilogy like the Batman films. I personally think it is time to put this franchise to sleep until something new or inspirational is thought of to truly revitalise this cornerstone film series in the future."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"best superman movie ever, amazing action scenes. just what we needed from superman"
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Wanted to love this film, but came away just liking it. Some awesome action scenes, but ultimately a lack of character development spoils it somewhat."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I don't understand the terrible critic reviews.  Maybe they hated the fact that Superman declared His pride in being American.  Since we know they hate patriotic pride.  Other than that great job on the story.  They didn't do what you would predict with Lois and Clark.  I know why movie critics hated it. 
One Jor-El speaks how cruel artifical population control was.  

Two.  The purposefully overt Christ parallel. 

Three.  He has pride in growing up in Kansas and bring an American. 

Four.  He destroys a drone right in front of the general.  Loved it.  But by critics loving any of this film they may find themselves looking for another job.  But they loved the previous one where the writers vomited all over Superman.  Where it's ""truth,  justice, and all that other stuff."" Bottom line they love progressivism."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome fight scenes!!! Best action superhero movie in awhile. It seem fresh and new compared to some of the recent movies.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,All I know I'm going to see it again. Saw it at midnight and it was a well written well directed movie. Jumps into the story feet with both feet in. I'm so glad they didn't make it about the daily planted and Clark Kent hanging around Louis. You don't need all that imput because its been done before and it's the worst part of Superman. I love how the movie sticks on Superman more and his villain which is an equal match.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,Expected more of storyline from it than action. Action wasnt bad but little more of the talking part would better
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Goosebumps all over the place, the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie was nothing short of a masterpiece. I can't even describe how amazing it was. Lots of action so be prepared...breath-taking fight sequences. I'm afraid for Thor to come out....
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,The worst most dissapointed story ever told about the man of steel. The MOS is about hope feeling protected. This was everything but that. It spent over half of the movie on a fight sequence. The supean image as we knew was lost from his mild manner character to his look to his most loved outfit. The superman inspiring song was also missing. I walked feeling very much empty and sad .
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,Starts well but is far too long and lacks heart and humour. Too many explosions and buildings collapsing - it makes Avengers Assemble feel like a period drama.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"The critics will moan as they just want you to read their article. This is in one word epic. Whilst watching it I was blown away, however once it had finished I wasn't left with anything in the way that the dark knight trilogy did. I think that's the only critique."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great restart of the Superman story. Excellent mix of Science Fiction and Comic book story telling. This movie is more serious than all the other versions as it should be. The flashback format of his childhood, allow the movie to get the action stated early on in the film. The Father/Son relationship is pivotal to the storyline and Kal El becoming a hero.  This film does a great job depicting Kal-El as a man, who through adversity becomes a hero....the man of steel."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie! It's worth seeing twice.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The action is solid, nearly the whole cast is spot on, so why does this movie just seem okay? There's no heart. And Amy Adams portrayal of Lois lane is baaaaaaad."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,den er bare suuuuper fed!!!!..I har gjort det igen Zack Snyder og Christopher Nolan...
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,Too alien.... too destructive. Where did the hero part go in super hero?
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Really solid origin movie that strikes a good balance between the traditional all powerful boy scout and a new updated take on Kal El. This is more a movie of discovering who and why Superman is through his two fathers. We get a sense of a destiny to make amends for his people, blended with American heartland pride and values. In the end Kal/Clark discovers himself from the values passed on from two loving fathers. We also get a sense there is more to his powers than a traditional Superman.  He is not only Kryptonian, he is ALL of the Krypton people specially baked in our Suns radiation. And the limit to his powers are to be discovered. He is a Kansas man with unbound power. This is a new and very intriging Superman."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"let me start by saying I am a comic book fan. the changes from the comics did bother me. but..... the movie was pretty good. entertaining. lots of action. def a darker superman than we are used to. and I can say if I didn't have preconceived ideas from reading the comics back in the day this movie would be perfect. typical loopholes like how the heck did she get there that fast when she was over here? and similar issues found in action movies taint this but other than that, I think this is a great output from dc comics. marvel still is better lol. no need to stay after the credits for extra scenes, booooooo."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,This movie was paced weird and the actor who played superman would go from being this awesome down to earth guy to a pretentious douchebag. He was like one of those pretty girls who is very aware that they are pretty. Other than that the movie was pretty alright. Fight scenes were incredible but with all the other fantastic superhero movies out I think that this one will be forgot when talking about the best superhero films.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Despite what many critics may want, this is a movie for the fans. Intense real time action sequences and an in depth look into a rebooted origin allows this movie to stand tall above its predecessors. Focused solely on superman and his evolution as a hero, this movie doesnt waste much time on sub-characters. Its a superman comic brought to life without a doubt. Jaw dropping heroics, and amazing portrayals of power make this movie a constant spectacle. The actors performances are decent but are vastly overshadow by an amazing plot and breath taking scenes, with the exception of russel crowe as jor-el. This is most definitely the superman movie we've been waiting for."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Lot of action, plot and character develpment lacking"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Man of Steel is the Superman of the 21st Century and the Superman that the big screen always needed - he's an ass-kicker!
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"""Man of Steel"" follows the path that Zack Synder continues to pave for himself by delivering a CGI overloaded film with an incredibly weak narrative."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"full of great ideas that never quite work, Man of Steel boasts some fine supporting performances and solid direction but lacks a gripping lead performance and is a little too long"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"A wonderful retelling of a story most people already know. Zack Snyder makes the experience feel new and fresh, and I loved the new take on all the characters. The casting really adds so much to this movie. Henry Cavill is a charming, serious and extremely cool Superman that brings the presence Superman deserves. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and without revealing anything I would highly recommend you see it."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is the Superman movie that I've wanted to see for a long time. There's a perfect balance of drama, sci-fi, and action to keep anyone entertained. Speaking of action, this is one of the most action-packed films I have seen in a long time. Unlike previous installments, it also shows how powerful Superman can be. Screw the critics, go see this movie!!! COMPLAINTS: Not enough romance between Lois and Clark (yeah, this dude said it) and (MY GOD!) the product placement! I was very distracted during a major fight sequence due to the words IHOP, SEARS, and 7-ELEVEN flashing in front of me."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This was one of my most anticipated movies of the year. Every trailer and tv spot kept building up my expectations. We see young Clark Kent adjust to his powers and struggle with his identity through flashbacks. I liked the character development but that part of the movie felt rushed and could've been focused on a little more. Then we get the crazy long action scene. We pretty much get the same fighting sequences over and over. I love long action scenes, but they should've changed it up. I have no issues with the cast. Overall, it didn't live up to my expectations."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie EVER
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"After thinking about the film, I choose to restart my review. This film is good but it's not the best super hero movie of all time. The first hour was amazing but it changed to a different movie after the first hour. If you're a Superman fan, you might love or hate it. Same for comic book fans.  If you love action movies, you'll love it. But if you love film as much as I do, you'll hate it."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Simply amazing! Exceeded our expectations.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"An intelligent Lois Lane, meets a determined orphan who happens to be Alien looking for information about his homeworld.  But really, beyond a few pacing problems and a little to much voice over for my taste, this was a reboot worth the wait.  I loved the connection between the leads.  No love sick flights, no forced revelations and best of all no magic memory-be-gone kiss.  We have two people very much wanting to do the right thing and figuring out how to do this.    I also loved all the details, Lexcorp trucks... Brainic-esk tech...  It wouldn't have surprised me to see Wayne Enterprises on those satellites you-know-who knocked out of the sky.  :)  Perry White was also very much the Editor/Father figure all his cub reporters need.  And Lumbard surprised me by not running off to save his own life first.  This movie has earned a spot on my all time high list."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Superman finally gets the epic treatment he deserves in today's cinema. Henry Cavill fills in the red and blue suit perfectly. Amy Adams does well in showing Lois Lane's ambition without being cloying or annoying. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner tug at the heartstrings as the Kents. Michael Shannon does Terence Stamp proud with his menacing and ruthless portrayal of Zod. And Russell Crowe as Jor-El... just fantastic! Snyder obviously wanted the fight/action scenes to be brutal and uncompromising - and did he ever succeed! I found myself holding my breath a couple of times... The action is that good.

There's so much else that could be said about this movie that was obviously made with a lot of care and affection and utmost respect to the Superman mythos for all involved... I would put this one on the same level as Avengers and Dark Knight... Yes, it's that good/epic."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Most of the emotional parts of the film were rushed but all in all I liked the movie
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"The cape, the face, musical score, a menacing villain, chaos, destruction, breaking canon, goosebumps. A satiated fanboy."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"It all started with a misleading trailer; the most artistic images from the film are in it. The entire film is full of lousy and cheesy dialogue which makes it harder for the actors to be realistic about their characters. Nonetheless, there is a never before seen portrayal of Krypton that shows a nice background for things to come. We see a Jesus-like young man, struggling to understand why he has to hide his superior lineage from humans. Russel Crowe was mostly a fitting match for Jor-El and Cavill showed us a Superman with human flaws, for once we see the vulnerability of The Man of Steel beyond kryptonite. Amy Adams was a no-no, though. Action-wise: it is good; above average at most. Oh, and it's too long where it doesn't need to."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"""Man of Steel"" is dark but its much more relative and realistic than any other superman film. He's not perfect which is what makes this superman movie better than the rest. He does things that you and I or any other person would do if we had all this power and asks himself the same questions we would all ask ourselves, in other words he's more human. This movie was amazing and I can't wait to see what Goyer and Nolan come up with next."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Bullshit reviews. This movie was awesome.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Although the movie got mixed critical reviews I really enjoyed it. There was lots of action and plenty of back story for me.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,The superman movie you've always wanted to see!!!!!
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Finally got it right
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The plot was all over the place...corny moments, confusion, and terrible acting was all I saw"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"The Superman Movie story for this generation. Man of steel has pulled what other Superman movie has never done  this movie has shown us the core of the character and what he can do. Emotional and action packet, this movie has it all and I can't wait for the sequel of this movie. Thank you God for NOT giving us another campy Superman movie."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,Wish there was for fighting and the story line wasn't really clear. Expected more from DC.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"A solid summer blockbuster, but not much more. Sadly this movie only felt like an enormous sci-fi film, rather than a character focused origin story. Still a great movie, but not what I expected."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It was good ... Not great.  Much better than Superman returns with Brandon Routh and Kevin Spacey. Henry Cavill was great as was Amy Adams, Crowe, Costner and Lane. Michael Shannon was an awesome bad guy - he's going to be a monster star. The flying was amazing. And Christopher Meloni steals everything he's in. It should have been a slam dunk but I thought the story was flat. Kryponian artificial insemination as a major plot point. Ewwww.  Superman needs a better story. Maybe Darksied in a JLA movie. We will see."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I have a few minor problems with the film.

The camera is really horrible. It's like Superman wants to be Jason Bourne or something.

The plot has potential to be in depth, but that's where it ends: potential. Also, I feel it is not original.. I felt that some of the plot and scenes are ripped out from other movies. In fact, now I understand why critics compare it to the two old movies, because the story is somewhat similar, especially Superman II.

But other than that, you are in for the Snyder visual ride that feels like it will never end, even if you want it to end, with Hans Zimmer's somewhat genius as the score.

My conclusion is this: every aspect of the film seemed like it's peaking up towards something satisfying, then it stays there..

P/S - That said, critics need to understand that this is a Superman for this generation ;)"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Despite being 2.5 hours, I never felt like the movie was dragging or boring.  This film, not surprisingly, reminded me of Batman Begins.  It's impossible to ignore what the real world reaction would be to an alien walking among us.  ""Kal"" essentially hides who he really is until Zod demands he show himself, and then ultimately defend his second home.  It was hard for me to get past a redheaded Lois, an earring toting Perry White, and no Jimmy Olsen.  But this film is definitely worth seeing more than once.  I saw it in 3D, and just like The Avengers, I won't do that again.  Didn't add much to the experience.  The sequels will have a lot to work with, and will set up a Justice League movie nicely."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"The first super hero movie worth seeing this summer.  It gives viewers a deep exploration into the Superman character, before delving in the expected action sequences.  While there are some holes (especially towards the end), it's more than an enjoyable fare and a great reboot for this franchise.  If you want to see mindless dribble than Iron Man 3 is perfect.  If you want to see an interesting take on a super hero that treats you as an intelligent adult go so Man of Steel"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,GOOOD!!!!! From beginning to end it was all that it should have been and more!!!!!!!
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Wow. Mucha acci√≥n y mucha destrucci√≥n
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Amazing movie .Best Superman ever
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Here's my review. Its too long to put here. This movie was depressing. Great spectacle, but pretty run of the mill: http://reiddesigns.tumblr.com/post/53593082422/man-of-steel-review"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Mr Nolan's touch is certainly evident with the darker side of the story and thankfully the well known backstory wasn't used, bring a fresher re-work and hell Henry Cavill is hot!!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,truly amazing. critics giving this movie a hard time for nothing... yes the action was a bit bloated.. but the overall synopsis is a satisfying and engrossing counterpart.. which will lead to what is a positive future for the man in blue and red
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Not going to lie that I am a huge Superman fan & I enjoyed the film a lot. That isn't to say that it couldn't have been better in some aspects. There were some flow issues and at times if gets caught between Snyder & Nolan's contributions to the film and doesn't move as well as it could. 
But in the end it was more of the Superman I had been waiting for since 2006 & beyond. Cavill is going to be a great Man of Steel, he did an amazing job and I expect more to follow! Definitely worth going to to have some fun & get to watch Superman have an epic rumble for once!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Movie was good.. Not that bad.. Idk why critics would hate.. Good enough story and action.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I really liked the non traditional more realistic view point this movie took. Not everyone would so readily grasp an alien being able to fly, shoot lasers from his eyes, being abnormally strong, and able to move at super sonic speeds without assuming they want to take over the world."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Good, but not great at all. Through the skin of their teeth DC has pulled out a decent Superman movie. The action was WAY over the top, and the story was slightly lacking in some areas, but if you're willing let go of reality and have fun for 2 and a half hours, go!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Now THAT is how a Superman movie should be done. This was everything you asked for and more. Can't wait til the next one!
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"exactly what I hoped a superman movie to be ""Action Heavy"" and boy did it deliver."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I loved this grown-up, non silly or campy version of the boy in blue. Krypton flashes to the screen as epic from the word go, and the writers deliver us a gritty and modern version of the story. The characters have depth, and more substance than you would expect from the usually cartooish one-dimensional villains  the Supermans of old faced."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie ever made.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Excellent version of Superman. Finally brings the entire story to life and makes it more relevant and up to par with The Dark Knight. Not an action packed, constant roller coaster. Instead, it is a full story with all the necessary elements of a good, epic-like movie."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,count me out of this fanboy club.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,I was skeptical about Man Of Steel going in cause there hasn't been a good Superman movie since Superman 2. I am happy to say that Man Of Steel is pretty damn awesome! Yes Superman is kicking much ass in this one! Trailers truly mislead you. Tons of action and a solid villain. I'm sure comic book nerds will have their gripes and issues with it but in my opinion this is the best Superman movie to date. I was surprised at how awesome it was and I was glad to have seen it.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,I saw it last night and it was awesome
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Great sci-fi storytelling and big action! Loved it -- beginning to end.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I'm surprised it's not doing well with the critics, but that's ok because the fans like it. Pretty good.. a little long for my taste though."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Over the top action, a Dark Knight-esque gritty feel, and only one or two silly jokes make this the Superman I was hoping it would be."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"If you watched the same movie I did, you're also wondering what movie the critics wandered into that earned Man of Steel a negative review. It was everything it should have been. Solid action movie, subtle-but-not-always humor, more background into the last days of Krypton and Kal's struggle to find out who he is and the burden he faces as he begins to understand the impact of answering one of the most enduring questions humans ask.. Are we alone in the universe. Henry Cavill plays a splendid Superman, and all the lesser parts fit together like a fine Swiss timepiece. The human struggle Kal faces, the action sequences and satisfactorily explaining how his suit seems as indestructible as he is all made for a thoroughly enjoyable and impressive reboot that is different enough to almost not be a reboot at all."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"The dry relationship between Lois Lane and Superman is easily forgiven due to a outstanding job on his orgin story, stellar perfomances, and stunning action sequences. Critics who complain it was too ""serious"" or ""too much action"" must have forgotten this is not popcorn Marvel movie. 'Nuff said."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Awesome
The way a superman movie should be."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"stellar cast, great performances, a truly believable movie with amazing effects. it really made you 'feel' for Clark and how being Superman isn't an easy thing.  Cavill gives weight and gravitas to the character. this is a fantastic reboot."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"These critics who think they understand a movie have it wrong. This movie was outstanding and provides a platform for a trilogy similar to batman begins. It was everything a superman fan would want from an origins story, enough said."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"! Amazing action! Below average story! Too much melo dramatic music scores! Too many liberties with the superman character ! No kryptonite! Still ammaaaaaaaazzzing action which makes up for all the negatives! Better story should make 
sequel untouchable"
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I wanted to like it so much more than I did. MOS had a lot of great elements, but Snyder just couldn't bring it together. It was like an overly-excited boy's first sexual experience--Rushed,  fumbling attempts at sentimentality before rushing into the big finish resulting in premature explosions. It seems Snyder was more interested in making things go boom, than creating any real depth or emotional sincerity in which we would care more for these characters. Goyer's script was really undercooked as well. Some awfully ham-fisted dialogue, weak story points and bouts of exposition to explain what was going on, were saved only by the terrific cast. If only they'd had something more substantial to work with in order to build some character development. There were fleeting moments of earnest emotion that I found myself craving more of, amongst the chaotic action. And the action... my god... just insanely over the top. I rolled my eyes more than once at the relentless barrage of effects-heavy destruction. Speaking of eyes-rolling... the thickly applied Jesus ""The Savior"" Christ references were just ridiculous. Now, none of this is to say that I didn't enjoy the film. Not at all. I quite enjoyed it! In fact it was very close to the Superman film I've always wanted to see. I was just expecting too much maybe. Good, not great."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,Meh. Lifeless story with transformeresque action scenes.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,best summer movie this year. good job Snyder and Nolan... thumbs up!
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"If you don't like this film, you will never like a Superman Movie ever! Great origin story, great villain, brilliant action."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,A little slow in the morning but otherwise not a bad movie.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"okay Superman or rather ""Man of Steel"" was a solid 9/10 movie. While I think it will be overshadowed a bit in memory by Star Trek, it was still a great movie. It is a fairly long movie and takes awhile to gain traction, but they had a lot of story to cover. The action picks up ten fold towards the last 3rd of the movie. As for the villain, general zod is everything he needed to be. I'd highly recommend this movie!"
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Wow not what I was expecting really. I guess you can have to much action and the rest story line character acting just doesn't fit in?  
e on"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is visual effect to the next level! I don't know how I can praise it enough, I adore this movie! By the way, I watched it on IMAX in Lincoln square amc, I think that's the best you can get in the United States."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel is a great movie despite the critics best efforts to keep Marvel on top. The piece has a lot of heart, and although there were a few cracks in story line, it deserves at least an eighty. Cavill and Adam's acting were both sharp and emotionally people can relate to them. I do not understand why critics keep giving reviews that are so negative, I don't see them producing anything better."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Best superman movie I've seen yet! Zach Snyder really brought this story back to life!
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,The best movie !!!!!!!!!
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie ever.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This movie is the one that finally made me give a crap about Superman.  The action sequences were really fun, but the pacing was very awkward in the moments leading up to the action, making the film seem a little disjointed.  Plus the overuse of zooms and relentless score made for an aesthetic that got a little annoying as time went by.  The performances and casting were all good, though pretty much everyone in the principle cast as at least one over the top moment.  All in all, it's no Dark Knight or even Batman Begins, but it's fun to watch Supes beat on the baddies, and its strengths outweigh its weaknesses."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Thank you Mr. Snyder!  You got it right.  You're going to have people complaining that there wasn't enough fighting in this Superman (Superman Returns), or not enough story in another...blah blah.  This Superman is exactly what everyone has been asking for out of a Superman film.  It gives Superman a good origin to stem off of to become who he is, and it shows why he is the way he is.  Don't really care what the critics say... Not to be rude, but giving this movie a 59% is a slap in the face; especially when you give movies such as The Life of Pie such incredible reviews... Don't pay attention to the critics, it's everything Superman, and a summer movie should be!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"it serves more action than just lifting or throwing heavy things. it also gives a deeper perspective of a Superman. a human side. that somehow we missed in Superman Returns. Christopher Nolan successfully brings something the 'dark'  to the plot. the only thing it missed : Henry Cavill is capable enough to deliver the character if he's given enough dialogue than just body show off. My friend couldn't stop to comment about Cavill's muscular body for almost the whole movie. And it has fantastic casts. who can play a better villain than Michael Shannon? but this time, he didn't scare me at all"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Enjoyed the movie..a different take on Superman...
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I'm honestly not sure if some of these critics watched the same movie as I did last night.  I can't fathom anyone leaving the theater after seeing MoS and not being completely satisfied.  It's the best Superman movie to date and has all the necessary ingredients to rival its stiffest competition in ""The Avengers"" and ""The Dark Knight "".  Cavill is a superb choice to don the cape and Shannon as Zod was as perfect a choice as Ledger was for the Joker.  It was everything it should be and more and will most likely be the measuring stick for superhero movies in the future.  Snyder's take on Krypton and Kryptonian technology was amazing.  I thought the CGI was done  in a way that very rarely felt CGI'd, and with the lighting and method of filming, there were several times throughout the movie that I caught myself imagining this could actually happen in real life.   Thank you for finally producing a Superman movie worthy of being shown on the big screen."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Finally a superman film that actually makes sense! Its more of a sci-fi film than a superhero film, which isn't a bad thing!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"It wasn't perfect compared to other attempts to darken up these comic book Hero's and Villains like the Dark Knight series but definitely better the other Super Man attempts and overall a pretty good movie with all the dramatic cinema elements, soundtrack, and character development. Henry Cavil is likable and believable as Superman similar to Christian Bale as Batman.  I left exited for more unlike previous attempt to reset the series."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Stay home and eat pie if you don't like it
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of both DC and superheroes. However, I've seen many DC films I have not liked so my opinion is not biased toward them. I'm not even a Superman fan (although I know everything about him). I am more partial to Batman. This film was everything I wanted it to be and more.

I think a small fault in the Nolan's stories for Batman was that the films focused too much on the messages and too little on the character. This is a perfect balance between the too. You get Superman. You learn where he comes from in a timeless yet fresh new way. The opening sequence blows you away while informing you of his alien origin. 

He struggles with many major themes. From betraying his kind, to determining where he keeps his allegiance. He is still the Superman you love. He was still raised in Kansas so he has those good, old values he grew up with. But at the same time he struggles with his powers and being different. 

These struggles are weaved throughout the story so that you never feel bored by them. So on the delivering a larger message, the film succeeds.

Now let me get to the action. The fight sequences were intense. Destruction, chaos, agility, strength, and powerful emotions all were displayed as our hero combated the various villains throughout the movie. I was afraid to blink. I didn't want to miss the awesome visuals as they clashed through cities and fought just as fiercely and smoothly as you could imagine on your head. You were barely aware that the images were CGI. 

Not sold on the story or the action? How about the acting? Henry Cavill is Superman. Every nuance in his facial expressions and actions prove that. The supporting cast all offers their talents and bring together a thoroughly well-acted movie.
Go see this movie and decide for yourself. I was disappointed when I read the reviews prior to seeing it because I thought it would be another failure. How wrong they were."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"As a Superman fan, I was skeptic, I didn't watch all the trailers, I tried not to read a lot about this movie, I wanted to make my OWN opinion and not what the critics are saying.   I must say this movie blew my mind.  It is great, it does have a few moments that I don't agree with, but over all, this movie is great.  Don't listen to the critics!  If you are a fan, this movie was made for you, not the critics.  I will watch this movie again and again."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,I thought the movie was ok. Something I didn't like was that the it was going to fast.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"The film had a lot of heart, and the acting was great throughout.  The action scenes were amazing!! Its an awesome movie and I can't wait for the sequel!"
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"'Man of Steel' was marketed more as a man's struggle with his duel life and how to bridge that gap. What was given to us was a about five mins of that, with nothing but explosions, gun fire and lots of property damage to follow. The pace was far to fast to build any depth to the characters or their relationships to one another (that kiss was not deserved at the end of the film). I wanted more about who Lois Lane was and not expository dialogue like ""I'm Pulitzer Prize Winner Journalist, Perry'. I wanted more of Clark battling with this identity crisis. I wanted more from this movie other than a popcorn flick. I expect more than just a popcorn flick."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Disappointing climax others still alright...  :-D
Overall still Pass..."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"go check this one out, its a fun movie with some massive action.  there is room for improvement but in all it was good.  do not wait until the end of the credits for any teasers you will be wasting your time.  Batman still holds the title for best DC movie and Marvel will not have a problem holding thier franchise lead."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"In the end the movie was what I had expected, an over the top visual effects movie on the most beloved comic book heroes along with the strong soundtrack of beloved Hans Zimmer.  Comparing the film to Superman Returns, this is a strong improvement, the story is a lot clearer and the villain has a greater script. I really did enjoy the cast, Henry Cavill did a good job at Superman, and the supporting cast like Russel Crowe, Michael Shannon, and Lawrence Fisburne were all amazing. However I don't think Amy Adams was fit for the role of Lois. As for the plot, it doesn't treat itself as really a superhero movie but more of an alien adapting himself to earth which I really appreciated since it took a different turn from the formulaic scenes. I must say there are some points in the film such as the destruction scene of Metropolis where you just know you've seen it too many times, in a way it kind of reminded me of Transformers 3 except it was done right.  Man Of Steel is obviously the type of movie that is the first in a trilogy, I'm just hoping that the second one is a great success like the Dark Knight with the Batman Trilogy. Therefore Man Of Steel gets a 9/10."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie has great potential as a starting point for a series of movies. While I've read some of the reviews about the lack of character development and while I agree to a certain extent, please, this is a super hero movie, not a drama. It's supposed to be fast paced, gritty and FUN. This movie is all of that and more. You are drawn into Clark's family both Earth and Krypton, caring for his Earth-bound family a lot. I would have to agree that skipping 3D is a definite. I think it lost a lot of the 'brightness' due to the process. No matter what you think or hear it's a fun ride. Enjoy it!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"movie was insane, best superman movie ever"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,There are so many good things about this movie that I can't not like it. Of course the action felt a little too huge. But he is SUPERMAN. We should expect him to have a huge task ahead of him action wise. I actually thought they could have had more action that the story could have demanded but they opted to get through it swiftly. This is a stinking great movie. I don't know how people can't like it.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Like him or hate him its one thing zack snyder knows how to do and thats make a superhero movie. No its not the perfect movie, but it is the superman movie fans and me myself alike been waiting for. you can't compare this to the 1978 version that ah just be rude, it stands alone and does it very well."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie has done for me what I thought was impossible. I thought it would never be possible to supplant The Dark Knight as the pinnacle of comic-book movies.   Man of Steel has done this... It has re-told (yet again) the origin of one of my favorite Superheroes in such a fashion that has brought him into the world that we know now.. a world where people are afraid of what they dont know.  this movie has done that gracefully and masterfully.   The supporting cast in this movie, particularly the 4 parents, were spot on what i've always wanted to see in the parents.  on the Kryptonian side, they   seemed to really want their child to survive,  the fact that they imbued him with the DNA of his entire race...wow...  On the human side, his parents knew what they had all along... They did not know what he would become, they just knew it was something special... so they imbued him with normal human values.   In any case... back to the review... this movie was great all around...the pacing was great... the action while a bit over done was good... the villains were believable not only as villains but beings with a purpose, albeit a twisted  purpose.  Great movie all around... 5 out of 5 stars"
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (out of four)

A far better version and a vast improvement over the last three ""Superman"" movies.  It is a bit cluttered with over-the-top action and less character development.  Some critics complained about it serious tones and less joy and playfullness, which I am fine with.  I don't need my comic book films to be comedic.  I liked the dramatic telling and the films does take the man of steel to new emotional heights.  It shows just how sophisticated the film industry has becomes when dealing with comic books.

Henry Cavill is the picture perfect version of the role of Superman.  He does look the part, with his tall, dark good looks and bulging muscles.  He also nails the more sensitive side to the character.  Not quite enough time is taken to fully develop him, but that is certainly no fault of the actor.  Same for Lois Lane.  She is well played by Amy Adams, but I wish a little more time is given to adding some depth.

The story is reminisant of the second Christopher Reeve movie.  We are given Superman's back story as he is sent from Krypton by his parents to earth.  It is much more reflective and told in flashbacks.  Colonel Zod (Michael Shannon) and his posse head to this world to capture him.  While here they threaten all of mankind.

The film is not perfect and has gathered some criticism for its overly serious tone.  So what.  The director has set out to reinvent the franchise and make it different he has done that in mostly a good way.  The film might not fly to the highest levels, but it does fly and pretty high at that.

"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Unbelievably incredible. The scope of the movie is mind-blowing - they do things we've never seen before with graphics, with destruction scenes, with Superman's story.

This reboot is exactly what we needed to make Superman relevant to us in this day and age, reminding us that he is the greatest of all superheroes."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"An epic adventure from start to finish, with minor pacing issues that do not take you out of the wonder and excitement this movie provides.  Highly recommend!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,A great and new telling of superman's story
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The movie is overwhelmingly uneven, but with flashes of great visuals, good acting, and awesome action. The movies last third is pretty much like every single big budget  super hero movie, a free for all in the city...eh slash earth. Henry Cavil is pretty ""meh"" as superman, and Russel Crowe looks like he paychecking Marlon Brando-style as Jor El adding nothing, but Michale Shannon as the main villain General Zod is great and gives suprising depth to his charachter, Kevin Costner is pretty good as Papa Kent. The movies action is pretty sweet too, but its sensory overload, too much/too long. The movie also has some nice small moments too. There are parts that didnt really work for me (the beginning added nothing, the final act way too long). For the most part I was pleased with what they did, i kind wish it didnt end with longest super hero finally grudge mach that goes on for an hour, while always filled with action eye candy (and boy does it deliver) gets sort of tiring"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie!!  It had an appropriate tone for what the writer and director were trying to accomplish, that being a story of an Alien who has spend 33 years of his life trying to fit in but at the same time hide who/what he truly is.  So it's a very serious real world take on what it would be like to be in his shoes.  There's not a lot of joy in his life, and just when you get to the point where he has some answers and you feel like he could begin to be happy and not hide who he is. . .it's at that moment that a world threat appears that is so serious that there is no room for joking.  The critic reviews are harsh because I think the critics are coming in with preconceived (and in many cases just wrong) notions on what a comic book movie should be.  I saw lots of reviews about how it didn't have enough funny parts, as if comic book movies are supposed to be funny.  News flash. ..the only comics that are funny are the ones in the new papers.  Comic books are dramas.  If you go into Man of Steel expecting Iron Man type laughs. . .yes you may be disappointed.  I recommend that you go into this movie with the mindset that you are going to see serious an alien invasion flic.  Having said that, this movie is not perfect.  It's way more action than character development / dialog. . .but it still works.  The good news is that after the climatic battle. . .you can feel and sense that things have lightened up. . .and there are a few laughs. . .even from Superman. . .which could lead to a more lightened sequel.  BTW:  the name ""Superman"" is used in the film. . .so any critic that says it wasn't. . .probably wasn't really paying attention."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Finally a Superman movie where his powers are to scale to the comics.
Don't believe the critics, it's not over the top. It's accurate."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Fittingly, the latest adaptation of America's iconic superhero descends upon the nation on Flag Day. But Superman's story opens far from our spacious skies and purple mountains. Man of Steel is an origin film, and as such it begins on Krypton, a red-hued planet home to the humanoid Kryptonians. The advanced race blends the style and social hierarchy of medieval Europe with highly advanced technology. Kryptonian leaders maintain power through population control, growing the next generation in a lab and engineering some to be statesmen, some to be warriors, others to be laborers. Despite this, Krypton is doomed. Severe resource mismanagement has left its core unstable and ready to erupt.

In the rushing first moments of Man of Steel, Kryptonian general Zod (Michael Shannon) rebels against the planet's rulers in an attempt to gain control and rescue the ""worthy"" Kryptonians before time runs out.

Against this hastily established backdrop, Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and his wife Lara (Ayelet Zurer) give birth to the first naturally born Kryptonian in ages, a son named Kal-El. With Krypton deteriorating around them, Jor-El decides to send his son away from the planet, out into the galaxy. In the high-tech equivalent of Moses' reed basket, baby Kal-El rockets toward a younger, innocent and less advanced place - Earth - occupied by an inferior race - us. Jor-El's hope is that his son - who will be ""a god"" to humanity - will be able to save the Kryptonian race from extinction. His mother worries that the people of Earth will fear what they don't understand, and try to kill him. Krypton implodes soon after, leaving the story to determine which parent is right.

"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie was amazing from the newest of the superman fans to the oldest, you will believe a man can fly."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Finally, a Superman that lives up to the hype and an end to 'Superman Lite'; for the first time cinematically, you get a fair idea of Kal-El's true power.  This movie is a SPECTACLE from beginning to end.  You almost feel like you need another set of eyes to take in the whole thing.  2nd best superhero movie of all time -- though it gives 'Avengers' a run for the money."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,This is the movie Superman fans have been waiting for. I really don't understand many of the reviews we've been seeing; it's as if the critics were seeing a different movie.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,All arguments are invalid.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Supreme commander was beaten by scientist,"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,great movie for audiences
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,Just got to say that it was better than the last one. Really liked scenes with Russell Crowe in them. I think the fights could have been better.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I had been looking forward to this movie for some time. I did not walk away from the cinema disappointed.

This was the Superman tale that I have been asking for - more intense action, somewhat grounded in reality (as much as could be expected given the nature of the character), and moral grey-area for our protagonist. The way Clark's childhood years were presented through flashbacks was appreciated. There's few people that haven't already had some exposure to the story of Superman, so Goyer/Nolan's decision to keep the back story to a minimum was wise in my opinion. Great performance by Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent in these sequences.

Over-the-top action sequences in the last half of the movie were awesome and prove that Snyder was the right guy for the job. My only minor gripe is that not enough time was devoted to fleshing the characters out. 15 minutes of screen time could have been easily cut from the last half of the film and instead been used for more dialogue between the characters in an effort to make the audience understand what makes them tick. Nobody would have missed a little less action and the extra character development would have made the film perfect.

Not to give away any spoilers, but the ending was not what I expected in any way, but I loved it. It was just the kick in the pants the franchise needed."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,it's was fucking great movie I ever seen in my life love it
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"If there is 10 stars, I will give 10! Man of Steel has a strong character, very emotional, interesting, and fun. There is an incredible fight between Clark Kent and Zod in the last 45 minutes. Man of Steel is not just a movie comic. Man of Steel is The Superman! AWESOME!!!!!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Good movie, great action, however there's a line that really got to me, Jor-el says to Sups ""You can save them all"" however he says that for nothing since the director killed tons of humans in the movie. Pilots on airplanes, etc..."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The new superman is waste of time for more than 2 hours, I rather watch my brother playing video game, almost the same, starts with some brief story telling then action action action action action action..... Until you feel dizzy, sick, almost want to throw up, superman and Zod throw each other out of buildings, from earth to space, at one time, superman got thrown through 5 buildings like a bullet, I was confused if he really wanted to protect America, that's five 9/11 out there!

Anyway, after all those super fights, when you are thinking almost impossible to kill Zod, superman just twisted his neck, 1 sec later he's dead just like a human being, I felt the last 2 hours of flight is a joke :P 

Nolan as a producer raised expectation for this movie, you can tell Nolan did set up the tone to a deep heavy story, but the director couldn't deliver it, keeps staying on the surface, uses lots of action to make it just visual effect.

Only highlight is the leading actor, he saved the movie a little, at least he's cute, that's all I remember now about the movie"
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I think this movie sells Cavill only. confronting Cavill's Superman with Routh's, Routh's sure doesn't seem as badass as Cavill's, but that only because they didn't give ROuth's the chance. as the story, I don't think the plot works, at least for me. and for those who vote 'rotten' for this movie. I know my judgement toward Superman clouds all this, because I don't really like the idea of superhero this kind, that's why for me Superman = Superfantasy. but I saw Thor and I liked it, so I guess the plot takes a great deal for me, and it didn't engage with me. it doesn't work for me because so many things, even it's explainable, in this movie I found pointless. but yeah, that's for me. I like Batman the most, so if you want to compare what kind of superhero Batman is and Superman is, I guess you know the answer why I don't find Superman charming. but Cavill sure is. :)"
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Interesting twist to the Superman story. I liked him more than I expected, but ultimately I was disappointed with the film.  At the same time, I expected to be disappointed... Richard Donner and Christopher Reeve set the bar so high..   I didn't like the way it was directed ... So many building were destroyed it was silly. 4/10"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Amazing movie so much better then Superman returns
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"96% (A) Superman kicking butt on the same level as, ""The Avengers!"" Yup, those are fighting words!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,It had its flaws - Snyder's over dramatic and overdone shots tired me out - and the pacing in the beginning made it feel sloppy but it comes together in the end perfectly. The movie is visually stunning and the acting is incredible. Henry Cavill truly is Superman. This is what a comic book movie should be.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel is everything you want in a Superman movie, Cavill does an amazing job brining the character to life and Snyder gives us an awesome display of Superman's power."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Just got back from seeing Man of Steel!  What a movie, this is a MUST SEE if you care at all for Superman.  This is one of the better/best versions and the 'tweaking' of the base storyline makes sense (re: Lois Lane - Terrific!).  There is one scene (no spoilers) where there is a tank car and building labeled 'LexCorp', guess they are planning a sequel!"
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,over all a pretty good movie for 21 century imagination
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is by far the best Superman movie ever. I'm still picking up my jaw from the awesome, amazing, epic movie. This is the Superman movie I have been waiting for a long time to see on screen. This Superman can kick some ####. Cannot wait to see what they do with the sequel. Anyway, don't listen to the Critic and go see it yourself."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Anyone who says this movie is not what it's hyped up to be is a complete idiot. The depth of this story for superman may be a different one than the DC comics portray it but it is well done and executed. Unlike the last superman film this one takes the cake. A new and improved version of superman from our childhoods. I hope Snyder keeps up the great work with superman and can't wait to see more of my all time favorite superhero!
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"wowzers, that was the man of tomorrow film I have wanted to see for the last 30 years.
the critics are wrong."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Best film of the summer
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Pay no attention to the critics score of this movie. Once again they have no idea what makes a good movie anymore. This movie was incredible. The action was amazing,  the story was great, and you're actually able to understand Superman. If you get the time go out and see this. The big screen just pulls you into everything and needs to be experienced this way. Dont just wait for blu ray. The movie also leaves so many possibilities for sequels. Plus you comic fans theres a couple hidden treasures if you pay close enough attention. Great movie. I'll probably end up seeing it again!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Don't listen to the naysayers. The film speaks well to the depth of the comic book lore and by extension what it says of the human spirit. Well written.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"In spite of the grande scale of the action sequences and very good cinematography, this movie was a mess. The story had no sense of pacing, scale, or relevancy. The actors were stiff. predictable, and flat. The movie felt lifeless with no idea where it wanted to go, or what it the movie was trying to say. It was a slog to watch, but the most painful part was in all the wasted potential. This movie should have been great, it could have been great, but ended up crashing."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"it was long... and I just didn't care... I didn't hate it, just not enough action or real character development for me."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel delivers as the first superman movie to deliver the story in a completely breathtaking way, visually it's unlike anything you've seen before. The cast delivers solid performances, the writing hit all of the right notes. Definitely a must see."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Man Of Steel is this year's Prometheus for me multiplied by 1000. Devoid of character, melodramatic, more ""Noooo"" moments than you can shake a stick at, and brimming with poor performances, this is a prime example of Hollywood using our love and fandom against us. 

The movie is as slow moving as it can be while refusing to develop any character let alone our main man Clark and due to this, not one of the very few emotionally charged scenes hits it's mark. 

With the unusual too much too late approach to the action, the novelty of seeing a man fly (no not iron man, Thor, Neo etc) is not something that stands on it's own anymore, so the thrill that we were told we were receiving by the filmmakers proved naught but an illusion behind which was just a series of ""burly brawl"" tropes taken from The Avengers, Infamous, spider man 2, spider man 3, the matrix revolutions and transformers 3.

Graphically it's at moments impressive but more often feels like a video game with compositing so bad even 3D can't hide it. Speech wise, every tike Jonathan Lent opens his mouth he spews forth yet another ""With great power..."" lecture while Zod is continuously doing the villain rant to the point that I wished The Hulk would come out and slam him around a bit just to make it stop. And don't get me started with the geek rage the story choices incurred within.

I could go on (however it's 4am and its time to try and shale off the disappointment enough to sleep so I can attend work I'm a few hours) but I'll conclude with this: MOS is a lazy attempt for DC to cash in on the happening trend of super hero blockbusters but they missed one huge factor: Marvel's movies (for the most part) have put forth the full effort and more importantly, been good."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,The fight sequence gave me a the same headache of Transformers. But this is definitely a better rebirth of Superman merchandise.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This movie shows just how much DC Comics is being really fearless about their relaunching of their characters. It is certainly not your parents' Superman, but it definitely stays true the essence of the characters."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"The best Superman movie ever! After watching The Man of Steel, the movie took me back to the Christopher Reeves Superman movies. Christopher Reeve was and always  will be the greatest Superman ever and no one can top that. But Cavill as Superman is as good as it gets. Respects to Brandon Ruth as Superman, he did an ok job, just the plot and not so well directing by Brian Singer, made Superman Returns look like a cartoon show made into a movie. Zack Snyder, David S. Goyer and Christopher Noland do understand Superman and it¬¥s origins and also gave us the look of how Superman should actually fight having his super powers. Not to mention that Henry Cavill looks the part and acted the part well. He fits to be our Superman generation for a long time. Man of Steel with the original Superman movie with Christopher Reeves are my favorites."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Louis bad, Superman awesome. better than most superhero movies, just watch it!"
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"First, I'll qualify this with: I'm a child of the Donner, Chris Reeve, goofball Clark, kinda campy movies. Next, I'll say that I'm all about a reboot if it betters the series. I'm just not really feeling like that's the case here. First there's Cavill. Even to reboot, Brandon Routh would've been a much better choice/fit. I mean, how old is Cavill? The dude's already got a receding hairline!! Not like he'll be around long for sequels (hence, another reboot!). I thought Superman Returns kept a good chunk of the older films (and Routh was dead-on as Superman/Clark/Reeve) while bringing a new maturity & new dimension to the Man of Steel. I mean, he had a kid!!! There were some good parts to MOS: his choice having such finality, Lois not being a badass reporter who's a complete idiot...all good. But even in a reboot there are some things you don't mess with. No Superman theme song? C'mon man!! Would you take the Imperial theme outta Star Wars? Would you take Bohemian Rhapsody outta Wayne's World? NO!!! Gotta say someone dropped the ball there. These Hollywood guys get on their high horse, get all ""ideal-a-rific"" & just wanna start changing stuff all around. Then they back it up with ""eh, if it doesn't work we'll just reboot"". Thing is: that's starting to get old. Hollywood makes a lot less money when we go see a flick at the dollar movies, or just wait for Redbox. Maybe it's time to say forget this $50+ movie night and just chill at the pad instead. All-in-all not the worst movie I've ever seen, but Star Trek's still the best so far this summer."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,The action was amazing and plentiful!
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Most of the standards set for superhero movies originate from past. This leaves a difficult challenge for a reboot. How to tell a story that has been told so many times before. That being said, I think Man of Steel was an excellent movie. Why? The dialog and the story were in sync so well, I never felt lost. The actors were extraordinary. As for the action, I think was expected. It is a superhero movie, there is going to be alot of action. You have to pick your battles with comic movies and nit picking isn't going to excuse the fact that this movie did its purpose, answered every questions so it could lead up to a sequel. It was artistic, action-filled and heartfelt."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This simply was not a good movie. Lemme start off by saying they tried to market it as continuing the tone set by Nolan's Batman trilogy. It looked dark, gritty, realistic, with a lot of heart to it. The trailers, the soundtrack, the actor, the Russell Crowe, all seemed amazing. This looked to be the Superman movie to end them all. But a part of me was worried about Zack Snyder, who is mostly known for his focus on action. How would he handle such an epic story like Superman? This movie was nothing like the new Batman trilogy. It was more like the Transformers trilogy. The plot was eerily similar to Transformers 3, in fact. Poor story, poor character development, poor dialogue. Some good acting in the flashback scenes, but overall not a good movie. Definitely some great action scenes, but the CGI was honestly way too obvious and took me out of the movie. Not that Superman is easy at all to pull off with practical effects like Batman is, but it was way over the top. It actually got boring too. There was never a true ""Fuck yeah"" moment for me. Not a lot of focus on developing Clark Kent, other than those few flashbacks. Not a lot of talking from Henry Cavill either. I tried to keep my expectations lower than usual for this movie, but it was still disappointing to me. I think it's a very forgettable movie and it left no real impression on me. Henry Cavill is the most beautiful man of all time though with that beard."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Subpar on almost all levels, Man of Steel is a huge disappointment. With set pieces stolen from Thor, action ripped off of The Avengers,  a Clark who has such little personality his lines could fit on a postage stamp, and a Superman devoid of any ""super,"" you'll be better off re-watching Superman Returns."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"It was fun. Everyone enjoyed it. What the fuck is wrong with these reviewers? It seems that in all the ""professional"" reviews, the complaint seems to be that it wasn't black and white film noir depicting the french renaissance. It was nice update on Superman, I will come back for more."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,I am happy to say Superman Man of Steel is fricking awesome!
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Just got through watching Man of Steel. I know we are super critical of DC super hero films due to the spectacular job Chris Nolan did on The Dark Knight Series. Man of Steel was fun, kept me up during that midnight showing, with a great story. The first 3 quarters of the film was developed really well. The film does a really thorough job in developing Superman's origin. However, the action scenes at the end was not done right. It was a great plot, but it was not developed well like Batman Begins or the first Iron Man. In other words, the concept of the Alien invasions and their motives for trying to take over the earth was a great story, they just did not develop the last quarter of the movie well enough to fit that plot. Nevertheless, it was good enough to want to see a sequel and done well enough to go see it."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I really dig the original take and untraditional story telling, however the pacing for this film was at a snails pace, while the character development was unnaturally fast. Man of Steel is on the right track, and is a visual spectacle, but it is a lacking heart underneath it all."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Don't be deterred by the critics.  It's a solid movie.  Great cast.  Great performances.  It nails the essence of Superman.  Special effects are dazzling, but not over the top.  See it.  Decide for yourself."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed Man of Steel.  It was a very good remake.  I'd seem it again.  Sure, there were issues i had with it, but they didn't take away my enjoyment of this film."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,I loved it. A big epic movie. The acting is great and the action is awesome. It is my favorite  comic book movie. I still love Donner's Superman the movie and that is still one of my favorite movies of all time but they are two different takes on Superman. They both get Superman right but one is very jokey and the other is serious. Henry Cavill was great in the role. Bring on the sequel.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Biggest disappointment in a very long time. With the involvement of Nolan, who successfully rebooted a certain other DC hero, there was a lot of potential for a good film here. Instead it's two and a half hours of the same long winded speech repeated several times, shameless product placements, unnecessary quick zoom shots, overused computer graphics, totally uninteresting action sequences, and a horrific script, which features lines such as ""evolution always wins"" and ""are you effing out of your mind?"". Unfortunately this movie will continue to make hundreds of millions of dollars, despite being the abomination that it is.
P.S. - Maybe DC should take a page out of Marvels book by actually putting a scene after the credits. That way the already disappointed audience won't be even more pissed off when leaving the theatre."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Great effects with a storyline that added believability to the superman story. Loved the strong emphasis on his alien nature.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Zack Snyder does a good job of bringing impressive action and massive scope to this Superman story.  Unfortunately, the pacing of the film's more tender moments (shown through flashbacks) makes it difficult to root for the hero or engage with the action that (I'm surprised to say) goes on for too long.  Still, I'm curious to see what comes next."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,A war between and melding of familiar Superman mythology and desire to do something new with the character.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,A whole different take on Superman. And change is good. A lot of fun.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"One of the few movies in recent memory that had me perched with attention, not wanting the experience to end. Sure little character development but who doesn't know that whole song and dance already. This one was all about the cause and effect - great forces caught in a reactive dance. Plus, it was good to see a little female empowerment and not the over-played hand of damsel in distress. But Ah! The intensity and spliced pace in storytelling unfolded in a way that was perfect for the attention deficit generations out there while giving depth through the actions and reactions. The final scene with Zod snapped that all into place there with split second choices being made at the speed of a bullet. With Man of Steel, actions sure speak louder than any words could. Looking forward to the reaction and sequel!"
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,I thought it was pretty decent.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Flawless, that's all you need to know. Go see it."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,I have a feeling that the critics are hard on this movie is related to they want some snobby-artist movie to come out and blow their mind.  This movie was solid from top to bottom.  The acting is what it is - A Comic book Movie!!!  Snyder and Nolan gave us another summer of whoop ass superhero action.  What's not to love.  Superman fights a real super villain = fun and worth seeing.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,The best Superman movie ever made and my new favorite superhero movie of all time.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie was amazing and the critics where wrong.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The chief problem here is one of rhythm and balance in the storytelling and directing. The movie swings between destructive overstatement and flat-footed homilies.
agreed."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I love this movie until the ending. With which I have many problems. But I have to hand it to Snyder, for finding a way to make the hero, not just the villain, someone I want to watch for over two hours."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"We finally have a Superman movie since Christopher Reeve! Man this was great, hard hitting, fantastic and a wonderful new look at Superman."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome!!! Great movie! Great visual effects! So much action! It's was... AMAZING
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved the movie. Fresh, fast paced, This is the real Man of Steel!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Man of Steel is not afraid to put away the childish reverence of the old Christopher Reeve films and carve out a new world for Superman and it pulls it off beautifully.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,3D not done well. It wasn't horrible but just not worthy of extra fee. Story telling is all over the place some great but rushed then jumps back & forth at a weird pace. Some key moments weren't explained to those who don't know Superman's story. Action scenes were very nicely done.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the critics. I think they went into the movie with preconceived poor opinions. The movie is wonderful. Henry Cavill is brilliant as the iconic Man in Steel. This is from a girl who wanted to marry Christopher Reeve after seeing Superman at age seven. I like that they didn't try to go with the trend and make him into some sort of morally ambiguous ""hero."" He still the saintly strongman anyone would want to save her butt when the world is threatened with destruction."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Just saw the movie and to say it put the last reboot to shame Is an understatement.  This movie was great,  the last superhero movie I saw was Iron Man 3. Yeah Man of Steel was definitely better.  I'm most likely seeing it again.  I recommend this and hope a sequel gets the green light."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,The worst comic book movie since Catwoman.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Superman's origin story is a basic one that we've seen a million times. This time around we spend more time on Krypton before its demise, seeing a new direction in which we see Jor-El kicking ass before sending his son to Earth. This is the first time we've really seen Superman done as an action film which is great. This is also a take we're the Kents are afraid of Clark revealing his secret to anyone because they fear him being taken away and being dissected in a lab. This is a new side of the Kents we've never seen before. Overall, I loved this movie. I understand the flaws people had with it. I'd prefer if Superman tried harder to move the fights out of Metropolis so that there was less collateral damage (hopefully this is an issue that's touched upon in the sequel when Lex Luthor address why Superman is a danger to humanity) and I have no problem with Zod's demise in the film either considering his final words. I loved this film and I'm willing to defend it against any of the critics. Although I think its greats, its definitely no Donner/Reeve film but what film is?"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"""[Superman] is everything that is good and wonderful, a burst of vibrant light shimmering in the skies. Cavill plays it all with such a strength of character, a quiet and immeasurable fortitude, and never for a moment fails to convince as the lead.""

http://www.examiner.com/review/explosive-action-and-a-brilliant-henry-cavill-own-man-of-steel"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I don't care what the critics say, this movie rocked!  Easily one of the most thrilling and awesome films of the year!  I particularly enjoyed how the story showed that Clark at first struggled with his overwhelming abilities rather than breezing through it and that he suffered as an outsider estranged from society.  Though I will say the first Superman is still the best one, this film makes for a fresh and believable take.  Plus, if they just recopied and revisited elements from the first movie it would have felt just as awkward as the Amazing Spiderman, especially when they avoided redoing the ""great responsibility"" bit.  Superman is given enemies that are not only a significant threat but also a good match, something that Superman is not given often considering his abilities.  Great action, good performances, decent story, this is may mark the beginning of the DC film universe to compete with Marvel.  But the film has its flaws and if DC Superheroes at the movies are to be successful, they should be as good as this film at least and at best match or even surpass the level of the Dark Knight films."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,Zack Snyder: lets just throw out the last 75 years of comic book lore and write a new superman story that is terrible and see how many people we can annoy. This movie is a slap in the face to the fans of superman/
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"We all knew that the endless comparisons were coming.  From Reeve to Williams, everything had been compared, analyzed and dissected. I too loved the Donner franchise, but let's face facts, as magical as it was, it was also silly, campy and way too over the top.  The villains were cardboard cutouts, and Clark Kent is so inept he makes me ill. This reboot was long overdue, and I for one am glad to get as far away from all things Donner. We've been there, and we've done that.  Didn't you get your fix with that love letter to Donner with Brandon Routh? Let's move on already!  For those who can't, or simply choose to hang on to Reeve's cape for dear life -- do it, and be be quiet about it. Leave the rest of us to OUR Supes..."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,I can't really imagine why just about anyone would not like or love this movie! I think people are holding too dearly onto a past image of Superman. This is clearly one of the best Superhero movies of all time!
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Despite some major plot holes, i enjoyed this movie."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Very enjoyable, alot better than superman returns, great cast, great acting lots of action and keeps you in the edge of your seat one of the best movies all year, but With Nolan in the works he still couldn't hit that stride as he did with the dark knight trilogy












Very Enjoyable movie, the action scenes were really intense the soundtrack was great heart pounding drums beats, a lot better than Super Man Returns, the best since Superman I and II. Also, despite what people are complaining about with the final fight ad all the destruction I believe that that's what needed to be done with superman instead of just lifting heavy objects...show his true strength, and Snyder did"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Wonderful movie...  Watch it... Better than iron man 3
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,There is no Kryptonite in this movie... Easily the best movie Zack Snyder has ever directed and a credit to the writing skills of Goyer.  Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner give so much character and life to Clark Kent\Kal-El's fathers.  Must see... can't wait to see again!!
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,It was an alright movie acting could have been better. It's like Snyder took a page from Michael Bay's journey and basically blew up everything
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Fast n furious was ""smarter"" than this? Really... Superman was amazing."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Fantastic Superman movie! Well worth seeing! The best one yet!
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome movie. the way a superman movie should be!!!
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Anyone giving this any less than 8/10 should probably stop thinking altogether.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"This was a true Superman homage. There was a multitude of references to the original movies, comic book icons, that were a treat to find. The cast was nothing short or stellar, each role being taken to its exact need, no one overshadowing the other. Some may find the pacing inconsistent, but it's important not to judge this movie as something it's not: an origin movie. We don't need to know every detail of his childhood. We don't need to have every minute detail spoon-fed to us. We were given total immersion. My only gripe was for the close ups in the fighting towards the end, where the shaking make catching details a little difficult, especially when combined with the typical 3D haze. But other than that, this is an instant favorite."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Sad to say, but I was really disappointed with this one. Though I did enjoy the perfectly casted actors, most of the cinematography (the zooming in and out got annoying after awhile), and 1 or 2 actions sequences; the film on a whole was a complete mess. There is just way too much going on in this movie, scenes come and go, character and story developments are left either undeveloped or rushed. It got to the point were I was starting to get really bored, Kept saying, ""End already!!"" All the characters are archetypes, not a shred of humanity in any of them. (I blame the writing, not the performances.) There isn't a sense of wonder or pure fun as in with the previous films, which to me is what makes Superman stand out from other Superhero movies. Regrettably, ""Man of Steel"" falls into the category of a ""dumb summer blockbuster,"" and Superman deserves better."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie deserved to have a higher rating from critics. I loved every second of it and I feel like it is being overly nit picked at.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Fantastic Movie.  It gave me much food for thought, and it's definitely relevant given what is going on in our society.  Why General Zod and company is overlooked in favor of 'Iron Man 3''s crop of generic villains is beyond me; there is just no comparison with regard to the quality of this movie and the mediocre-ness of that one.  That people complained about the movie being ""too serious"" are just harping upon nostalgia.  Go see it.  Do it!  Do it or i'll be a sad panda. :3"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"An excellent film that stands on it's own. There is plenty of character here, despite what many reviewers are saying. To say the movie lacks warmth is simply a false statement. Certainly there is plenty of action, but there is also plenty of character development and the acting is top flight. Casting is absolutely perfect. It's shot impeccably well, the editing is taut and tight, the score and music editing are fantastic and the film is exceptionally well paced for it's two and a half hour running time. The visual effects are simply astounding, everything is rendered to perfection and not once is there a moment where the use of CGI is readily apparent. I believe the casting of Cavill as Superman was a perfect choice, a great balance between physique and acting ability. I think those who are panning this film should compare it against some other recent blockbuster action films and perhaps consider that to create a film such as this is no easy task, and that Snyder has done an apt job restarting this franchise.  There is simply no way to please everyone when making a movie like this, and I am a bit surprised at the amount of reviews that are mostly positive that are being judged as rotten by the RT staffers. I believe the meter would be closer to 75% fresh is those primarily positive reviews were changed from rotten to fresh.

This film is as close to perfection in technical terms as it's possible to get, and I think reviewers should set their own personal whims aside and simply review films on their technical merits. It's quite difficult to find fault with this movie in terms of production, and the writing, I believe, is as good or better than other superhero blockbusters of the day."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Epic fight scenes. Some plot holes but overall happy with the story. This is how Supermen should fight. Love Amy Adams, but we really need a girl with an edge to play Lois Lane. Lawrence Fishbourne was ok as Perry White, but that earring was quite distracting to me. Why would an old fashioned editor of an established paper have an earring? In some scenes, at least to me, Henry Cavill looks like an older and mature Tom Welling. Michael Shannon again corners the market on the whole righteous villain persona that he does so well in Boardwalk Empire. Interesting ending. Kudos to Snyder for giving Superman a formidable footing. Perhaps a little more humor might have helped with the average moviegoer, but not sure how it would have gone with the overall theme."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Man Of Steel. First day first show beeches

Anywho Good movie but doesn't quite do justice to superman, after watching all-star superman it changed the scope of the limited view i had about superman. The character is really worth idolizing but is so wrongly treated by audience & DC alike.

DC has this image they want to feed the people that Batman is the soul of DC which isn't quite true for me. You see batman holding all these morals which actually are the same morals superman strive for, if not with more ideals which his earth parents taught him.

But man of steel felt like DC didn't properly decide which image of supes they wanted to go for, sure all the stuff about not fitting in made you feel yeah this is a guy going through so much, but the end to the whole Superman & general zod fight just tarnishes the ideals he strives for, the end to the fight could have been handled much better. No matter how they try to bring forth colossal destruction to overwhelm you with intensity of the situation, most of the action scenes seem underwhelming after some time, there is too much emphasis on use of the movie soundtrack [ideal of hope] to dramatize action, also, scenes don't feel connection to one another, supes just seems to randomly pop up, the movie doesn't seem to exibit some little connecting threads nolan had with his batman films, snyder needs to improve alot in his next.

Henry Cavill is a good superman, there is alot of room to grow as the MOS. General Zod was the bomb Michael Shannon has become my favorite DC Villan from the movieverse, the sheer energy & power he brought to his character was phenomenal, at times i felt like i was witnessing a real dictator first hand. Amy as Lois was too soft of a personality, i miss the bossy dominating Lois, and superman making his identity a dead giveaway for the people around him was really sad to see, yes just like amazing spider man, and since lois knows who clark is [ yes this is not even a spoiler, i didn't even get spoiled while watching the film ], i wonder how Lois & Clark will really grow up into one of the best love stories of comic book history. Well then can't fix this buy just saying hey, i am not Klark the superman, i am clark the kent :P

This is not a bad movie, any superhero fan should go and watch it, but let me just say that this is not a superhero movie the proudly holds the superhero flag high in front of casual folk. And if there is really a justice league movie in the future you need the most iconic figure among superheroes to be the greatest pure good out there. But sadly i get the feel that batman will have a larger role in Justice League movie.

These days all the rage is Iron Man & Batman, i wish superhero movies were made according to their real comic stories. you made your bulk load of money already Marvel & DC,  the only thing i want to see is how the real comic stories in Live action, i want to see Earth 616 & Earth-1 not some fake movie universe, it's hard to care for something which is not real in the geekverse :("
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Exquisite motion picture. 10/10 would watch again.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Solid Superman film, had some hiccups but a lot of fun!"
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It was decent. The action sequences are amazing, that's where I got my money's worth."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"If you are a fan of Superman, you will love this. Wish there was some more dialogue for Clark but still exceptional."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,Henry Cavill's face is very expressive and he has big muscles.   I have to admit disappointment though not by either of the above points.   Tried to do a little too much and went off the rails a few times.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Amazing, just amazing! Well worth seeing and well worth buying the minute it's out on DVD! -if you are a Kansas native, you'll be infinitely proud :D LOVED IT!"
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I liked it enough where I want to see it again, but I have to admit that I miss the light- heartedness that the Christopher Reeve films had."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Magnificent, Henry Cavill is perfect"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I have seen other people's reviews and agree with majority of their concerns, but at the end of the day, it was a good movie. I really think some of these people are being crybabies about this and trying a little to hard to critic this movie. other than that, the storyline was a little so so, but overall it was a good movie, not the best, but a good movie...."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,I really liked it. although amy adams as lois lane was not the goods. I think all scenes with Laurence fishburne were a waste.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Was not disappointed! IMAX 3D-- well worth the ticket price!!!
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"7/10 - would watch again. The cons: Clark Kent was meh. Lois Lane was hardly better. The big bad had his show stolen by his lieutenant. The movie suffered from having one too many climactic battles. Pros: Faora-Ul was an awesome bad guy. Russell Crowe continues to dole out the Russell Crowe-ness. I gave a very surprising number of cares about whether Lawrence Fishburne and an unnamed intern were about to die. The action was awesome in the literal sense of the word. Fights felt climactic, like clashes between demigods or forces of nature. This movie didn't seem to shy away from collateral damage in the way that a lot of other superhero movies have. You get bonus points if you spot a lexcorp reference your first time watching the movie =)"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Amazing , Lived up to the hype"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"loved it leaps and bounds  better than the rest and as a die hard fan of superman let me start by saying this is what we have bin waiting for a legit threat against big blue true epic scale fights focusing on the true power of superman , i thought the story was great all the actor were spot on this superman is bad a$$ we want the effects we want the fights if you dont know who superman is get the hell out of the theater and stop wining about plot we want action and we got it !   cant wait to see more from this superman must see for fans yes it wasnt perfect but it did wonders showcasing the awesome force that is superman"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,I thought it was an extremely entertaining movie and will be buying it when it comes out on DVD without a doubt.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!!
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Don't listen to critics because they're crazy!!! The movie was flawless!!!
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Very good film. Easily the best film of the year so far. Would like to have seen more of the Clark Kent/ Metropolis side of things, but if you want to kick off a franchise this does so with a bang!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Best of the superman series yet Henry was apt and Zack snyder lived up to the expectations.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"There are some good things about Man of Steel, but it's problems slightly out weigh the good stuff. The surprising fact is that all the issues are about equal between Snyder and Goyer. The acting is probably the strongest point and I really liked everything with Krypton. Goyer is usually great, but here he's given us a disappointment. It's not a terrible film, just slightly disappointing."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,About time they do superman some justice.  Best super hero and had no movie. Straight to the point no bs.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,A lot better than I thought. Only drawback Amy Adams never had much to do in the film. Henry Cavill is 10 times better than Brandon Routh as Superman. However the film is stolen by Michael Shannon as General Zod.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Beyond intense.  I can definitely see why ultra liberal people will dislike this movie: because it flies in the face of their worldview.  The quality of the production is superb.  The acting and characters are great!  And the theme is exquisite.  As long as you are not ubber-liberal, you will LOVE this movie!!"
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"While the special effects were stunning, the story wasn't engaging and the script was embarrassing."
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This movie walks a fine line between good and bad. Sadly, it falls stale on its drunken path. Overcrowded fight scenes, a overly fast paced plot, a questionable script, and a very anticlimactic conclusion leaves us to think whether or not we actually enjoyed it as a movie, rather than an eye popping visual effect show. The cast is possibly the only redeeming factor in this movie that over stays its welcome. Yes, it's watchable, but is it necessary?"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Great new re-image of a classic superhero.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,If you're not a fan of the 3D like all other movies with the 3D option they're are tons of aspects that make for a fairly entertaining 3D glasses movie. Far from the actual comic book story. Focuses much on Superman's back story. If you're looking for something to keep you entertainment for 2 and a half hours and don't know the actual story of Clark Kent you will find it enjoyable. True Superman fans might find disappointment. Gotta see it for yourself. All on all fairly decent.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,By far the best Superman film to date and far superior to the original Iron Man.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Holy Shit, they went full-blown Sci-Fi! Man of Steel is enough of a departure from the conventions of the Superhero genre that love it or hate it, no reasonable person could deny this single truth -- Zach Snyder, et all, have created something entirely brand new. 

The wholesome character we fell in love with 30+ years ago remains intact, though perhaps now he's got a little more pent-up angst. Russel Crowe, Diane Lane, and Kevin Costner all deliver earnest performances as three of Supes' four parents, laying bare the moral framework that guides the transformation of our hero.

Man of Steel employs a not-entirely-linear story structure, which works really well to keep our character firmly rooted in Americana, while maintaining the immediacy of a story that has every indication of a catastrophic alien invasion of Earth. 

I went into this movie trying my best to keep my optimism reserved, seeing as how much it's being pooh-poohed by so many critics. I left the film reminded of why I hate critics (and why I almost regret once being one). 

Yes, Man of Steel has some flaws, and the main one I'd point out would be a storyline that sometimes becomes a bit too convenient and/or plot-holey. But if you let that ruin an otherwise rousing good time, then I think you should just stay home and stick with Netflix. 

I REALLY enjoyed Man of Steel, A LOT! So much so that I'm forced to adjust the grades I've given to every other movie I've seen this year. Star Trek is no longer an A+. Iron Man 3 has been downgraded to a B+, and so has This is the End, simply because Man of Steel has reminded me what it's like when a director truly swings for the fences. Zach Snyder is a trailblazer, and I love him for that. His latest work is easily his strongest, and it gets a solid A in my book!"
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I feel bad for Zack Snyder. No really, I do. Whether it's his largely faithful adaptation of Watchmen, his stylistically violent 300, his take on zombies with Dawn of The Dead, or the gleefully imaginative visual orgasm that is Suckerpunch, he always seems to get the short end of the stick when it comes to critical reception. I'm going on record saying there's a conspiracy among the film industry to demean Zack Snyder's films. Now that I've said it I'll take the tinfoil hat off and actually talk about Man of Steel. 

Superman has been through the wringer lately and let's face it, he hasn't had many decent outings. Hell, he hasn't had outings at all lately. When Batman is finished though, it's only logical to attempt giving Superman that prestigious treatment next. Obviously Man of Steel is an origin story, but not so obviously it's actually a literal origin story beginning with the actual birth of Kal-El (AKA Clark Kent AKA Superman). Krypton is imploding literally and figuratively due to some unfortunate living circumstances and shady backstabbing from General Zod, menacingly played by Michael Shannon even when he occasionally hams it up or is given some self-evident lines. Kal's father Jor- El (Russell Crowe) sends him off to an unknown planet (if you guessed Earth you're probably a sorcerer) with a codex that is the key to saving the Kryptonian species. The planet however is doomed regardless and Zod goes off the deep end after witnessing Jor-El send baby Kal away. He then kills Jor-El. Zod is deemed a traitor and action against his crew is taken by the council.

We then bare witness lots of exposition. My only substantial gripe with the entire film is the pacing and chronology of these expositional scenes. We flip flop back and forth to young Clark, teen Clark, and Superman sporadically leaving the viewer frustrated and often unable to lose their emotions in each individual flashback. The scenes are juxtaposed with relevant themes occurring parallel in the film identifying a purpose but rarely do we ever feel connected to the occurrences on screen. Man of Steel stumbles and falls quite a bit during its first 45 minutes scavenging for an identity that fortunately writer David S. Goyer and Director Zack Snyder find. 

Once the plot allows characters like Lois Lane to appear (Amy Adams) and villain General Zod to be reintroduced things escalate. Clark comes to acceptance with his gift through various characters, most notably his Earth parents played by Diane Lane and Kevin Costner. Man of Steel enters unforgettable territory though through its action contradicting what I believe many were expecting. There is no mistaking the tone of Man of Steel, similar to Nolan's Batman trilogy this is social commentary and realistic drama wrapped up in superhero costumes. The story itself though isn't going to blow my minds. I'd argue it's a character study of Superman that isn't perfectly executed but effective nonetheless.

Continuing with the bubbling momentum, Man of Steel explodes into a spectacle of dazzling action that nails everything a Superman film should encompass. Even though the opening scenes on Krypton contain epic in scale action sequences, nothing can prepare you for the final act which contains what I'm fearlessly proclaiming the greatest one on one battle in superhero cinema existence. There is Avengers level destruction in this films crescendo of action sequences. Some may potentially find it exhausting due to its lengthy duration; I however was on the edge of my seat. Visual Effects Academy Awards have got be signed, sealed, and delivered for this film. 

Man of Steel is slow out of the gate to some worrying levels, but it ultimately is just feeding off of every moment to build to extreme levels of grandeur. It begins with a bang and ends with an atom bomb. Please Warner Brothers, keep this franchise in the hands of Snyder and Goyer. If this is the origin story, than I'm beyond stoked for whatever is next."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Just one word can describe this movie - Awesome! It's the Superman movie we've all been waiting for.
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel is superb; it is multi-layered, action packed and intelligently well thought out. One of the best superhero movies and a great science fiction film. 

Impressive notes:
Krypton is a beautiful, technological advanced (some well thought out science within) and unique society and culture. 

Kal-El is indeed an alien, an outcast on Earth. As a child he is unable to control his powers. The character is built around him finding his place as he struggles to make sense of who he is. 

These quotes from Jor-El represents some dominant themes of the movie best 
√¢??What if a child dreamed of becoming something other than what society had intended? What if a child aspired to something greater?√¢??
√¢??You will give the people of Earth an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun. In time, you will help them accomplish wonders.√¢??

or from Jonathan Kent
√¢??You're not just anyone. One day, you're going to have to make a choice. You have to decide what kind of man you want to grow up to be. Whoever that man is, good character or bad, it's going to change the world.√¢??

These quotes are an excellent representation of what this movie of Kal-El is about. This is an origin story of Superman done in a non-linear manner. I believe the underlining messages are that society shapes character and you can aspire to be good. Kal-El, through his Earth parent's upbringing is that √¢??lead by example√¢?? figure. 

The approach of dealing with alien first contact. That it is usually dealt with in Sci-fi as they are invaders or an inspiration for humanity. Here it is both (trying not to spoil anything). 

The movie has excellent science fiction in it. While (as great Sci-fi should) also having social commentary. 

Yes, there is plenty of amazing and exciting action scenes. Seeing these Kryptonians move is amazing and unlike really any other superhero films. 

I personally found this to be in league with the Dark Knight Trilogy and much better than any Marvel films. 

Henry Cavill is Superman and I can't wait for the sequel and to see it again. I hope Zack Snyder, David Goyer and the rest of the creative cast and crew return as well."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Flipping masterpiece. Thank you, Zack Synder."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"A very powerful movie that shouldn't be compared, just taken in as its own. This is a great reboot to the original superhero and an amazing way to connect with a new generation of fans."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Loved how they involved Krypton in this movie. You understand more about Clark/Kal-El and his home planet and why he was sent to Earth. The villain is great in this movie because this makes the fighting in this movie very personal because of Krypton and its people as well as Earth and its people. Very good movie!
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Decent movie. Nothing horrible but it wasn't as good as I was hoping it'd be. As someone who doesn't like Superman to begin with, I was hoping it would change my mind, but unfortunately, it didn't."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Overall had enough diversity in the scenes to feel as a whole superman package.  offered scenes surrounding krypton, his home planet, his struggle and experience as a child, as well as his humanity and psychological disposition to the human race.  stoic superman is casted well with caville, he has a genuine appearance supporting the amiable presence on screen.  The movie has important story developments before the exceedingly awesome and long action sequences blow your mind.  There is much to see in this movie, and just when you think its over, there's probably another 20 minutes of explosions and superman destroying new York.  To make this even better, It is definitely dark and unhindered by the outcome of good and bad.  Without a doubt the best, most well paced super hero film which showcases visual flare with substance to back it."
"Jun 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Awsome movie critcs are stupid. It's superman like never seen before yet like he was meant to be super -powerful. If you like you super-hero movie to be super you must check it out.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEGATIVE,Boring movie the biggest disappointment of the year  !!!
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"As a consumer I found this movie to be quite exceptional for a Superman movie. It was done like no other and was interesting in the fact that it kept you anticipating the entire time. As a critic I found this movie awful and distasteful in the fact that it had no rising action, no plot problem, no plot solution, but had one continuous climax that lasted throughout the entire movie. It was done like no other and failed in the process. The movie begins showing Jor-el and Lara (Kal-el's {Clark's} birth parents) having Kal-el mid birth and Jor-el warning the what seems to be leaders of the planet about the impending doom that will strike their planet. We see a man called General Zod kill Jor-el which is a bad decision already because we are seeing the antagonist at the beginning of the movie before we even see what happens to the protagonist 5 minutes in. we then are dragged into jumping around points in Clark's life, having random flash backs of his childhood with the Kents, assuming that we know what's going on and that we fully understand the order in which they show us these flash backs. The movie has short and disconnected scenes that make no sense on their own and barely tie together due to being so disconnected and far apart. There is barely any dialogue, and when there is it consists of someone picking on Clark and Clark resisting the urge to hurt them. This shows the process of him learning not to hurt others just because he's stronger than them, but the movie fails to show the importance of it because of how light the situations were. We then move to General Zod coming to Earth and flat out telling everyone that he's an alien, he's looking for one of his kind, and that the name of the one they're searching for is Kal-el. Fortunately, Clark conveniently found a space ship buried 18,000 years ago in the arctic that makes a hologram of his biological father appear and tell him only information that pertains to what Zod wants, but fails to tell him along with the audience anything else about why he was sent to Earth AND the immensity of his destiny. While failing to do that, it also shows that Clark makes the completely illogical choice to become a super hero. When we know that by the experiences of his life that we see in the movie he would normally of chosen to be evil. If the movie would have shown more of the coming of age part of his life, that could of been completely avoided. After Clark surrenders to Zod, Zod treats him like a friend and sees that Clark needs to adjust to the atmosphere that Kryptonians can breathe. When Clark wakes up, Zod had a change of heart and is ultimately Clark's enemy. We then have a battle between the military of the United States and Zod's army and Clark fighting a gravity beam. This was supposed to show that he could overcome it with the strength he needed. By gathering the strength of hope from the people that were counting on him, since this movies theme was SUPPOSED to be about hope; his family shield means hope and is stated several times throughout the movie. So again a cinematic technique that was a failure due to lack of detail. Zod and Clark then fight in the city and the fight only lasts 10 minutes at most. Clark then has Zod in a choke hold and Zod uses his heat vision to try and attack humans. Clark tries to get him to stop but then resorts to breaking Zod's neck to ensure the safety of the humans. This was an attempt to show that Clark cares so much about the humans that he would kill the only other surviving member of his race to protect them. However, by doing that they destroyed the character of Superman. Superman has always stood for acceptance and finding a way around murder. No matter how powerful Superman is he never kills and always finds a way around murder. It's to show that no matter the situation and no matter how much power or control you have, you shouldn't choose life and death for someone. So by trying to show an ""ultimate sacrifice"" from Clark by having him kill off an evil man from his planet that he barely knew so that he may protect people that he didn't know ruined any chance of showing the Superman that stands for hope and peace and just makes him another piece on a chess board full of people that will kill in order to stay on that board. Snyder and Nolan could have done a lot better with this movie and it feels like they were rushed and they wanted to get it out of the way for a different movie. Perhaps another Batman film? Or maybe a Justice league movie? I don't know. But in being so eager to please the fans, they ruined the character and personality traits that made Superman who he is. A man without weakness is still only as strong as his moral standing. And from this movie, we see that the new ""Man of Steel"" is just as weak as all of us."
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"Unreal effects, massive scale, awesome villain. Takes itself seriously but not too seriously. Its the way a modern Superman story should be told. See it in 3D if you can."
"Jun 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,"It's a bird! It's a plane! No, it's Superman!! And this time we have ""Henry Cavill"" wearing the red cape, and blue tights! This was not a movie I was interested in seeing at the theater, but for some reason, I ended up seeing it anyway.  And as I expected I loathed it. To be honest I've never been a big fan of Superman, don't ask em why, because honestly I have no clue what so ever but what I do know is that I hated this film. I very much hated this movie, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's not nearly the best either. I actually liked ""Superman Returns"" (Preparing myself for the 'boos' from the fanboys) and thought that this one had potential to be just as good. And it actually started out pretty decently... that is for the first 10-20 minutes or so, which had Russell Crowe in the alien world battling to help save our Clark Kent.  I enjoyed that so much that I thought this was going to be one of the better movies of the year. Man, was I totally wrong about that one. The film contains a excellent cast, with a few neat/cool set pieces and action sequences, but all that is good is squashed by a bad director, horrible screen-play, little character development, and a middle half of the film lacking in intensity, and excitement of any sort. O.K so let's start with the problems. I (as you all know) have never liked director 'Zack Snyder'. The first movie I reviewed this year was 'Sucker Punch' which was directed by him and I hated it, I gave it 1 Star and F rating. For one thing I've never been a fan of his shooting styles, and his lighting techniques, and camera movements,  for me it all comes out as if the film was set at 6PM on a Wednesday night. Mr. Snyder really never knows what he is doing and you can tell it, all the poor crew and actors have no idea what to do during everything and it just doesn't work. Zack Snyder just never works and will never live up o some of the elder directors. The screen-play is a major weakness to Superman's strength. Everything works well up until the film cuts from a baby superman to an adult version without much explanation, I mean you start out with him being sent to earth as a baby, then you cut to him as a 30 year old man? I'm stuck thinking to myself 'What the heck is going on?'. Instead the story of his childhood is told through flashbacks which appear at random moments during the film. I found it a lot more confusing then to simply start with superman growing up as a child on the farm. The major flaw with the film is the lack of character development. Every character was undercooked.  I didn't know who any of the people where, that are what will make this film so inaccessible for non-superman fans.  Lois Lane, Lex Luther, even the Superman character himself was so under developed! I had no idea who anybody was because they're so called characters were not really anything but random citizens. Kevin Costner's character received little screen time and he was the major celebrity of the film that made people want to come and see this, and also his part in it was just weak! I mean he's brought in as a very emotional father figure for Superman, yet he's just not given any screen time to truly seize your emotions at all, just a thin character who's just there. Lois Lane is just a flat personality with little know background except that she works for the daily planet and has a crush on Superman. I mean you've got Amy Adams and yet you don't give her much to work with. The middle half of this film really drags on and happens way to quickly, it lacks intensity or excitement; it actually began to bore me so much that I was thinking on just leaving. This film was way too long, for the thin plot which has been done, redone, and done again way too many times. They stretched anything they could possibly stretch, out, I mean it could have been a decent 2 hour movie but instead they dragged it out and wasted my time. Now for the good, that will not cancel out the evil! This film sports an excellent group of cast members. 'Henry Cavill' looks like Superman would look like and acts well as the character, but he is nothing more than average in the part. 'Amy Adams' plays Lois Lane and she looked and acted the part perfectly, but sadly enough she wasn't given much materiel to work with, honestly. And 'Laurence Fishburne', while at first glance may have looked too serious for the part, actually manages to pull off the part perfectly as the head of the daily planet newspaper, Lex Luther.  'Russell Crowe' and 'Ayelet Zurer' as Superman's real Father and Mother were excellent. 'Russell Crow' always is excellent in anything you put him in so to no surprise he perfectly leads the first 10-20 minutes, it's too bad he's not in the whole thing.  'Michael Shannon' as our villain is great casting, he fits in very well as our crazy villain general, and I just loved his emotions, and facial expressions in reactions to Superman.  I just loved how the actor was able to pull off as very sadistically realistic scary villain. It was great. Some set pieces were also great to look at and a few action scenes were as well. And they where choreographed very well. All in All this Superman film never took flight for me. Any outsider, who knows little of the Superman comics, will not find this enjoyable, due to the shooting styles and the lack of excitement. D   6/20/13

P.S: A sequel is set for release in the packed 2015 schedule. I just hope this one is taken better care of then it was, and in more capable hands, it's supposed to include 'Ben Affleck' as Batman. We'll just have to wait and see what we get."
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"Love this portrayal of Superman. Not as 'deep' as Batman trilogy, but much better compared to Superman Returns. It deserves 8/10 rating, IMO."
"Jun 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,predictable storyline
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"Brilliant use and placement of backstories and minimal utilisation of classic ""Superman"" elements (as minimal as it can get in staying true to the brand) results in a generally amazing storyline, marred only by Snyder's obsession with drawn out, overblown action sequences that literally blasts through the stratosphere, and slightly uneven, occasionally plodding pacing. Very strong cast, with special mention going to Antje Trauer for her supporting role as Faora. Overall, enjoyable indeed."
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"Just watched it on imax today, i love it!  for the first time i feel scared and so weak as a human being..

KAL EL = KAKAROT ...  U know what im talkin about...xD"

"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great redux of Superman. Enjoyed it. My only critique is that the fight scenes could have been shorter. I'd like to see more story and ""Superman"" segments and less of two equals pushing(fighting) back and forth.  You're both invincible, we get it, now please someone just win already so we can get to next scene."
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"Spoiler Review:
This movie was my most anticipated movie of the summer. The trailers were perfect and just spectacular. Nolan was attached to the project and I love Snyder as a director. I was able to catch a screening of it last night and let me tell you, I was a little bit disappointed.

Now don't get me wrong. This is still a great movie. Some of the elements just let me down. But some of the elements were also fantastic. I find myself kind of stuck with this movie. But one thing is for sure, it gives me optimism for the future. I know for sure it's a great start to a franchise. 

Now back to the movie. Anyways, I loved the beginning of this movie. You get to see Krypton as a real planet. It's not just a dead ice planet that you first saw in the first Superman. You get to see their technology, the animals, and the different elements of the planet. I like that they spent time in Krypton. You get to see the reason behind General Zod and it's a good reason. He's not just a bad person who wishes to see pain inflicted on others but he wishes to save his home planet. General Zod was a good villain for this one. Michael Shannon was good as Zod. He was evil and sinister. Shannon played him well. And let me tell you, Russell Crowe is fantastic as Jor-El. In fact, he was one of my favorite things about this movie. He was just so good in it. The steps he took to save Kal and the emotions in his face were great. I also love how he helped Kal along the way throughout this movie. And it's really interesting to see that Superman's suit came from this father. In fact, all the Kryptonians have a version of it. It's not just something his mother created. It's literally his suit of armor which I like. In fact, I loved that the S stood for something. It stands for hope like the El house does and every Kryptonian has something different and I liked that little add-on.

"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,love it! definitely watch it in 3d
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,Critics are stupid. this is the best movie of all time. I saw it twice in the theaters
"Jun 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,A disappointing reboot
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,Excellent all around. I don't know how anyone can trash this film.
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"Creanme cuando digo que mis expectativas con respecto a esta pel√≠cula estaba por los aires. Fueron ampliamente sobrepasadas. No tengo nada malo que decir sobre ella. Leyendo las criticas negativas entiendo que provienen en su gran mayoria de personas mayores de 30 a√±os, para las cuales es dif√≠cil desligarse del Superman de Chirstopher Reeve. Esas pel√≠culas pertenecen a una era en la cual gente como yo estabamos ni√±os y contextualizadas a su momento, cautivaron a toda una generaci√≥n. No soy un fan de ultimo minuto de Superman, lo he sido y seguire siendo hasta la muerte. Este es el Superman de esta generaci√≥n y debe ser bien recibido por todas las audiencias."
"Jun 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,"If nothing else, Amy Adams as Lois Lane was enough to excite before watching the film. Sure enough, it was unmistakable that the film has a Christopher Nolan feel because of the impressive 3D special effects and the fresh take on the story of MOS' origin. Russell Crowe was impressive as ever as the macho but caring Kryptonite father Jo El. The first 1/4 of the movie was devoted to the disintegration of Krypton and how Russell had desperately sent his baby MOS to earth to safeguard his Krypton race. From there, it was fast forward to  a young MOS with a very buff Henry Cavill fill the shoes of the late Christopher Reeves and his romantic entanglement with  Amy Adams. And then the mayhem begins with Krypton enemies. Impressive mayhem galore and super human fights between MOS and his Kryptonite enemies.  However, there is something lacking in MOS that no amount of CGI or buff actors can supplement to make MOS a super movie. That is charisma and  winsome humour which we saw in Robert Downey junior that made the Ironman the most successful super hero franchise ever. MOS in the end fails because Henry Cavil does not have the charisma."

"Jun 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,Exactly what I rated.
"Jun 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,I had a feeling this movie was being over-hyped.  The critics have only given this a 60% rating which is barely a recommended movie. Meanwhile This is The End is getting an 81% go see that instead.
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed this movie even though I'm not a supes fanboy.  I think a lot of critics didn't like this because they watched it as a full movie and not as an origin movie. This is like Batman Begins to The Dark Knight, a beginning to the much anticipated series of superman movies that would lead to Justice League (hopefully)."
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,very very good movie.  woild recommend.
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie, because Superman itself is difficult to deal with the subject matter. Zack Snyder handle it very well, although a little fly in the ointment, but as a new power-good movie!"
"Jun 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,This movie has flaws but I do have to say it is better than Superman Returns. Hands down. And Michael Shannon is a perfect General Zod.
"Jun 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,the story line and romance is missing
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,screw the haters...best superhero movie yet!
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,This Man Of Steel is the Superman I have wanted to see since my days of watching Superman 2 over and over again.
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,Please watch this movie. Don't let the critics get to you!
"Jun 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,such a dissapointment
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"I think professional critics are looking at this brand new Superman film through so many filters based on past versions of the same character that they're missing the entire point of what a ""reboot"" really means. I went in to the theatre with a particular mindset; I had to put aside all previous versions & watch it from a perspective of someone that is introduced for the very first time to this emblematic character at the end I enjoyed every second of it; just because is different.  This is fresh, its new, its made for our times. In my very humble opinion; this is one of the very best ""super hero"" movies of all times."
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie made.... Ever!!!
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,Movie of the year. Gave me goosebumps throughout. A few plot holes but still the superman film the fans deserve! Fantastic movie!
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,The best Superman movie so far.
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"A Great one by Zack Snyder, it's just the begining. Super package of Superman, can't wait for the next MOS"
"Jun 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,I saw this movie last weekend. It was terrible. Superman's life/story is not supposed to be dark & gloomy like Batman's life/story.
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"Loved it, very intense, but real. It really is the best Superman movie!"
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning, wonderful story telling ... This is how Superman should been film in the first place ... Super Movie"
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,Man of Steel blew away my expectations and then some.  It was spectacular!  Visual effects were amazing and the storytelling was captivating.
"Jun 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Disappointing. Just finished watching. I really wanted to enjoy it, and while some parts were decent it just wasn't that fun. So much repetitive action that it just felt long and boring. If watching two invincible guys being smashed into buildings for twenty minutes sounds like fun to you than you'll probably enjoy this. Even the scenes before that being run through the other buildings and fields was just more of the same.The Avengers final battle was much better but there was some actual light hardheartedness thrown in and so was Iron Man 3 for that matter. The trailer looked much better. A lot of quick cut action shots, as well, made it hard to tell was was happening especially on Krypton."
"Jun 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,Epic reboot of this franchise. Its delivers piles of action set pieces and a super serious Superman which i personally love. Why would you want Superman to have a sence of humor anyway. Excellent supporting performances from especially Michael Shannon who is on bad guy duty as Zod. Overall this is a summer blockbuster combined with a strong origin story. Roll on to part 2 folks
"Jun 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,Definitely the same route as Dark Knight though nowhere close.
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"Foundations of Steel - The Superman of Today (June 2013) 

In many ways, I have been waiting for the chance to share these ideas since I first discovered I had some appreciation and respect for DC√É¬¢(TM)s all powerful super man. Before we move along, I should clarify the stance I√É¬¢(TM)m about to take: I am, and always will be, a fan of DC comics and their iconic characters.

For some of you, this is where you will confront the decision of whether or not you want to read further. For the rest, perhaps I will successfully convey my thinking and impressions about why Nolan√¢(TM)s and Snyder√¢(TM)s real world action-centric Man Of Steel (2013) - is (in my opinion) a great movie despite its short-comings. Rest assured, I intend to remain neutral in my arguments - though fighting off the inner fan boy will be no easy feat.

Unlike many of the existing comments, reviews, and blogs - mine do not rely on the experience of one viewing of the film. I have, since its release, already seen the film three times in cinemas - hoping to finally form together the ideas I am sharing with you now. I can illustrate my arguments on the fact that: this is not an adaptation of any particular text - or in this case, the seventy (give or take) years of material that has catapult Superman into becoming one of the world√¢(TM)s largest and most popular cultural icons. In addition, this film is not a hopeless remake. Despite having major similarities to its predecessors, Man of Steel (2013) is both refreshing and original, which are long overdue for our favourite son of Krypton. 

The greatest attribute of this film, is also very likely the reason why it has received such mixed reviews. Man of Steel (2013) is much more of a retelling, refitting, and 
re-imagining of a story that we have all been too familiarized with. There are too many differences between what we know and expect, and what was delivered in the end. Arguably, these differences are what set this film far beyond any of the previous films that have attempted to do this icon any justice. This Superman makes more sense to me, than any film or television version ever has. The film actually uses these assumptions as its pretence for bringing Superman into the story. We learn things about his early life that would have ultimately played a significant part in his overall development, thus leading him to the point at which we meet him in this story - a mysterious wanderer on a search for his place in the world. While we are witness to the experiences Clark faces as a boy, the film does not dwell too heavily on the stages of his transformations. The film is deliberate in its forgoing of the typical hero origin film formula. That is, the maturation of Clark and his abilities are only given to us in tidbits presented by the memories (flashbacks) that are triggered from moments of value in his early life. There is no discovery of his individual abilities, or aspirations for the life of a hero. What is given instead, is an uplifting boyish reaction to the discovery of flight in a two part sequence which I believe features, what I am calling, some of the film√¢(TM)s best Superman shots?. Throughout the film, we see Clark face a series of events that challenge and burden his character and do an even better job at conveying his sense and struggles with morality. This same morality will then become the foundation for which our notions of Superman are built. We are fortunate to finally understand that Superman is not inherently good or noble, but that he was taught these values through a lifetime of experiencing both the highest and lowest examples of humanity. 

There is no objection to the fact that this film is much darker than any other Superman film ever made. The moments of joy and humour are too far spread in this film - which I believe is the primary factor for most of the negative reviews it has received. Since when is Superman so blatantly existential? While most of us forget that this character was imagined by two poverty stricken boys in the 1930s, it appears that Nolan and Goyer aimed to expose one crucial element that Superman embodies. This is the element of faith - and by extension - hope. Grant Morrison√¢(TM)s All-Star Superman? is one of the most profound stories which eloquently illustrated the darker characteristics of Superman√¢(TM)s existence. It was not nearly the happiest or most joyful Superman stories ever told, however it was very insightful. Much of what we know about Superman is our own impressions of what he is and should be - but what if our noble hero struggled with his own humanity, his own sense of right and wrong, his triple identity and his own mortality and that of those around him? These questions dive into more darker content which if left unanswered, leave us with only a fraction of the potential depth of the character - it leaves us wanting to know more. Considering Nolan√¢(TM)s and Goyer√¢(TM)s  revival of the Batman franchise - it is fair to say that these questions are very much real world questions that beg a real world approach.

Below are just some of the concepts that arise in this film which may have weighed the overall audience reception.√Ç¬† 

- Spoiler Start - 

We finally get to explore - however brief - Superman home planet, Krypton. Although it was otherworldly, it resembled a cross between the world of James Cameron Avatar (2009) and Jurassic Park (1993). During the opening sequence we are introduced to Jor-El, his wife Lara, and the council of Krypton. This sequence could have very well been the end of a much more in depth story of the War of Krypton - ending with the decision to send their only child off into space. Instead, we get a small excerpt of this massive untold story that later drives the conflict that will continue on Earth. I believe that there could have been much more in this opening sequence that could have developed the story and audience appeal and affection for Jor-El and Lara. I believe that more could have been shown to convince the audience that the decision to send their first born - let alone natural born - child light years away was a desperate attempt to salvage the whole future of Krypton. If you don√¢(TM)t pay attention to this scene, you will miss out on how they√¢(TM)ve weaved this into the story, just enough so that it does in fact seem like such a desperate attempt indeed. Jor-El fuses the cells of all unborn future children of Krypton with the individual cells of his only son. Therein, Kal-El is not only the last son of Krypton, he is the last father of its entire race in more ways than one. 

It is unlikely that a Pulitzer prize winning reporter is too dumbfounded to realize that her Daily Planet co-worker, Clark Kent, is in fact her dreamy crush, Superman. Well, as impossible as that may seem, it has been the only perception and delivery of the trouble bound independent reporter for decades. I believe that in a real world, Lois Lane would have deciphered this ruse almost immediately. Hence, out with this old approach and in with the new. Lois Lane plops herself into the middle of all the action in this world, and she uncovers the big secret before she even knows his name is Clark. She does this during a montage sequence of her investigation into the mysterious wanderer. So rather than trying to find out who Superman is - she spends her time trying to find out who Clark is. This approach not only speeds up what we already know and expect (that Lois Lane eventually discovers Clark is Superman), but it gives way to a different story potential. Lois will play the role of protecting Clark from being exposed as Superman. She already has a big role to play, long before the next two sequels are written. 

No kryptonite, no problem. There is no emerald green space rock that weakens Superman in this film, and thank goodness for that. While it√¢(TM)s never really explained why slivers of his home planet can kill him - it is partially suggested that he would not survive in the atmosphere of his home planet. The story tells us what we already know - that Earth√¢(TM)s sun fuels his cells giving him the exponentially advanced abilities he has, and that Earth√¢(TM)s gravity will allow his dense physiology to fly. It was uncommonly known that - had he been raised on Krypton, Kal-El would be just as normal as the next guy. This light touch on the topic may give future introduction of the fatal green rock more weight as an element that can harm Superman.

Among the major differences, is the jaw dropping decisions this Superman makes which set him apart from what we know and expect. In plain words, this Superman kills. He consciously makes the decision, with a weighted heart, to destroy unborn Kryptonians and murder one of the last members of his planet, General Zod. Many people, including myself, found this to be the most shocking scene of the movie - but also the clearest indication that this Superman is not like any other we have seen. It bothered me, that they would take such a huge risk, and change perhaps one of the biggest things about this character - and that is that he values all life. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that we have been na√É¬Øve all along. Superman is a god on Earth; he has the power to shape the world to his liking. When will he know what his own limitations are? A being with all the right ideas is still capable of making all the wrong decisions. They are still capable of committing violence. So the question is: when does Superman realize he cannot cross the line into becoming like Zod? It can only be after dealing with the burden of having crossed that proverbial line. Only after making the mistake, and facing the consequences - both morally and ethically, can anyone with Superman√¢(TM)s sensibilities and morals ever realize that there is in fact limitations to extreme power.

- Spoiler End - 

With regards to its technical elements and compositions, I would say that there is definitely a noticeable collaboration of styles (Nolan and Snyder). Some of the Nolan-esque qualities include the in-depth layers in its story and characters, while exploring darker contents and theme - in some attempt to ground his perception of the material in a realistic world. For the Snyder qualities of this film, it boils down to the direction of its fulfilling action sequences. For once, we get to see Superman go toe-to-toe with equal adversaries - who do an amazing job at mopping the floor with his amateur style of combat. It√¢(TM)s fair enough to make that claim; Superman is no warrior - a result of never needing to be anything other than the strong flying man who can knock you into next week without breaking a sweat. The action sequences are immense and awesome. They displayed the best of what we would expect a battle between ultimate beings to be like. 

If I had to summarize the points this film seems to convey, I would say that this is a story about Kal-El finding balance and coming to terms with the visions that both his biological and surrogate fathers had for him. The trick seems to be distinguishing the contradiction each father faced with regards to their son√¢(TM)s life. Jor-El wants his son to have the freedom of choice to forge his own destiny and to be the first of his kind (natural born) to lead Krypton out of its state of decreasing civility. Jonathan wants his son to live without the burden of the world on his shoulders, and to find well-enough purpose out of the simple course of human life, while staying hidden from the dangers of an un-accepting world. I would also say that this film is more about Clark Kent√¢(TM)s experience as a human, and Kal-El decision to become a heroic symbol for mankind - if not the ideal for them to strive towards?. 

As a fan, I can say that we do feel like we have invested our time into these characters, and that there is a sense of ownership when it comes to the releases of these major films. It can sometimes 
feel as though we have been cheated out of our enjoyment of the films when they exclude our favourite characteristics, plots, or moments from the comics. This reaction is multiplied when ourexpectations are not met - and the anticipation is not resolved. With regards to Man of Steel (2013), I can say that I was definitely not expecting this character and story driven approach. I expected the same old things (he lands on Earth, he grows up in Kansas, discovers his powers, moves to metropolis, meets Lois, fights Lex and humanity loves him in the end), but was relieved that we are given a Superman who does have some of our expected qualities - but he is an outcast, who has almost mastered his powers, who explores his alien side, meets Lois, consciously kills, and humanity fears him in the end. I√¢(TM)d say that there is more to unveil about this version, but one thing is definitely assured: this is indeed, the Superman of today. 


Thanks for enduring!

"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel was Excellent, action was non-stop, the pacing of the story was done with perfection, Favorite Superhero movie, blows away Marvel, Thanks Zack Snyder for the Best Movie of 2013"
"Jun 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Despite stiff acting from Henry Cavill, and almost endless explosions, Man of Steel entertains and delivers. Michael Shannon's performance also puts him at the top of the food chain."
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,Some part of the plot was rushed some were dragged but it compensated with the  visual effects. VISUAL I meant the beauty of  Kal-El. :D
"Jun 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Ok so I couldn't help myself and went to see the 7.20 show tonight in 3D...  Blah Blah Blah....   I am getting too old but this film is really just noise - it's fun, and I don't regret watching it but it was just blah... seen it before in so many other manifestations and will surely see it again - the same noise level and mindlessness of Ironman 3...  doesnt really contribute much to anything.  

Must say that the lesbian assistant to Zor was a teenage fantasy a long time ago and the new one doesnt conger up the same image :)"
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"Saw the movie last night at a WB pre-screening.  I think the critics have it all wrong.  It's a solid B movie and I think a great foundation for the character.  The problem is movie critics go into this with preconceived notions and high expectations for a Superman movie.  You don't see those same sentiments with other comic book movies like say Avengers which they've rated much higher.  I think the Nolan/Snyder/Goyer team did a great job and I'm excited to see where they take the character next.  The movie looks beautiful, the characters have heart and Superman punches!  What else can you ask for in a summer blockbuster?  If I have one complaint it's that the movie is paced incredibly fast.  I'll definitely be seeing it again because it can be hard to keep up at times.  I think most fans and moviegoers alike will enjoy this movie."
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,Some people are way too focused on comparisons to the Donner movies. They're not seeing the principle of it being a reboot. How can a 3/5 be marked as Rotten ? That surely must be a Fresh ?? I think some of the ratings need to be looked at again by the admin on here.
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"Nothing to say about the plot, it was not bad or great. Much of the story wasn't in chronological order which bothered me but wasn't a problem. The CGI was awesome I do not know how they even have the budget to support the special effects. Altogether it was the best movie o the year for me but it would have been the best movie ever if their weren't as many flash-backs."
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie was awesome! I didn't need to see it on 3D though. The 3D effects were not that impressive, or perhaps, I really didn't notice them because the action of this movie is back to back! In retrospect I liked everything about the movie, it was a different approach on the story but over all (in my opinion) it kept the major events of the traditional story the same! The visuals of this movie were the best I've ever seen in a while, Avatar, Oz the Great and Powerful, Star Trek Into Darkness are among the ones that did a great job on special effects and this movie surpass them in my opinion! THE MUSIC! the music of this movie was GREAT, Hans Zimmer ones again did a great job, the music really help build up to the key moments in the movie... The fight scenes were sooo good!, Love the woman villain, she was awesome, one of my favorite, and Henry Cavill was wonderful, he HAVE to be Superman from now on, you don't know how much he made me wish I can kiss him, lord have mercy he looked gorgeously handsome in this movie, mmmmm. Lois Lane was annoying me sometimes when she will appear at every scene were Superman was in trouble but overall Amy Adams did a great job (wish her hair would have been darker)! A PERFECT SUMMER BLOCK BUSTER MOVIE GO SEE IT!"
"Jun 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This movie had its moments I liked the different ways they portryed superman and his lie growing up not so much the realtionship with his dad pa kent . Amy adams one of best lois lanes in years . We have seen ,in the past a human side to Superman this time we dont see adult clark at til lthe end . my beef was the same old downtown  major city massive destruction fight scene .some humor which is good . nice stuff with clark and Martha Kent . The movie is worth seeing they have something in this see where it goes"
"Jun 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,Don't expect Nolan calbre cinema and you'll have a good time.
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,This is the Superman movie for the 21st Century!
"Jun 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Syed says; Comic like action sequences, incredible visuals and dazzling action sequences   complement Man of Steel, but the movie misses out a bit of screen color, although that opinion is personal."
"Jun 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,Though not as great as Nolan's trilogy yet the best superman movie ever. This superman killed the most innocents in the history of superhero movies -_-'''.
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,Excellent movie. Good start to the franchise. I believe it's better than batman begins in terms of origin stories.
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"I cried so much, lol. I really get too emotional.
Great special effects. If you have a chance to see it in 4DX / 3D / IMAX, take it! 
Fantastic cast: hot Henri Cavill (I can't stand former Superman Brandon Routh), cute Amy Adams, convincing Kevin Costner and charismatic Russell Crowe, all are stunning. 
My only drawback is Michael Shannon as General Zod, I just don't like this actor at all. I guess they picked him well to play this part, so I can dislike him even more."
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,The best superman movie ever!!!!
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"A movie review for those who appreciate a solid movie review. This movie was excellent. Great acting + great storyline + great special effects = A great movie! Other reviews that I've read/heard were mixed to negative because the storyline was not representative of the originals. I believe that's what made it so good and appealing. Take The Dark Knight trilogy for instance. A complete retelling of the Batman story, and it was amazing. As a matter of fact, Zack Snyder openly stated that this version of Superman was going to be unlike anything ever done before, and it was. And it was a very good thing. From the opening scene to the last one, this movie was an emotional roller coaster that even the iron hearted would appreciate. Finally, a Superman that we can relate to due to the real world moral conflicts that a man faces. Not having kryptonite grounds Superman in a way that no other movie ever did, but should have. It provides a clear message on being genuinely good and helping others if it's within your power to do so. Once again, if you didn't catch my opinion, this is a must see for all ages."
"Jun 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,I was super excited to see Man of Steel but was greatly disappointed. I had no real connection to the characters and the fighting scenes seem never ending.
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"seen it at malaysia adi, truly a classic !"
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"This was excellent!!! This is the Superman I've waited to see for 7 years! The dark knight trilogy blew up a hospital, Avengers destroyed half of NYC. THIS IS SUPERMAN!!! I WANT MORE MORE MORE!!!!"
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"After seeing this movie last night in 3D... all I have to say is... AWSOME!!! I've always been a big fan of Marvel and their movies, but today I've become an even bigger fan of DC's Superman, can't wait for the sequel. Great story, great cast and great special effects!"
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"Aunque aun no la estrenan en Chile, la expectaci√≥n es grande, y se entiende que los cr√≠ticos hagan su trabajo, pero los n√∫meros mandan, y mas que eso el sentir del publico no de un pu√±ado de cr√≠ticos........sera la mas grande, eso es indiscutible."
"Jun 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,The Superman we know and love would move heaven and earth to find a better way. Snyder's Superman doesn't even try.
"Jun 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,WTF DID I JUST WATCH?!?!
"Jun 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Confusing action sequence, rushed character development, too much emphasis on bland and open-space CGI..the film has Zack Snyder's finger prints all over the place. The Man Of Steel is neither the Superman film we audiences deserve, nor the one we need. Probs to Hans Zimmer for awesome Soundtracks though. Also some strong support characters like the Kents, with a very solid and touching first arc (but it went down hill from there). Im going to have to watch it a second time to really make up my mind, but my thoughts as of now? A popcorn action flick, at best. Nice leap from the Green Lantern movie I will admit, but not enough to clear the bar set by Marvel Studio."
"Jun 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,Good but different storyline; great leading man
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel is like an Issue #0 meets All-Star Superman. It's a good Origin story and all but there seems to be something missing from it movie-plot-wise. Henry Carvill did Kal justice in both personality and appearance. Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon did their characters justice. It makes a good comic book but movie-wise there seems to be something missing. But it still delivers a good entertaining experience. Additionally, the easter eggs were both in your face and subtle (e.g. Guardian and Lexcorp). The obvious absence of Lex on screen was like a breath of fresh air because he as been overused by Hollywood in Superman movies. Bottomline, it's a good story but as a movie, it seems to be missing something. But overall, i'd say it's still better than certain previous incarnations of Kal."
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel delivers when it comes to action, which is pretty overwhelming for most of the movie. But doing so, it sacrifices a firm portrayal of the Man of Steel himself. Henry Cavill plays the most convincing Superman since Christopher Reeve but his acting prowess is seldom given any importance in the movie. 

That being said, Man of Steel does build a very solid foundation of Superman's origin story, providing hope for many possible sequel(s). Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner deliver impressive performances as expected."
"Jun 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,""" Every person can be a force for good, free to forge his own destiny.""
Kevin Costner, Diane Lane and Henry Cavill moments are priceless. The heart of this movie."
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,I really liked this movie. Despite it's running time it never got boring. The effects were jawdropping and there also weren't too many fights as some have suggested.
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"The movie is a success.
Emotionally attached, is not the same as the usual superhero movies.
Feel engaged towards the film,worth watching."
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"Brilliantly crafted by Snyder and scored by Zimmer, this serious adaptation could have added some laughs. Both Cavill and Adams delivered believable performances, but Crowe was the obvious star. It could have done the flashbacks better though, since those were obviously misplaced scenes."
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"Screw the ""critics"". Yes it has its flaws, like a choppy story towards the beginning. But it's a great origin story and it does help to have action sequences that blow you away."
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,I would have to say that I really enjoyed this movie. A struggle for a man not of this world to find himself and become a symbol of hope. I really think the critics are stuck on the old and really need to embrace the new.
"Jun 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,Good special effects and finally a good replacement for superman since smallville ended but not much else to rave about.
"Jun 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,:( why was i not satisfied with this?
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,A great movie for a super hero. Man of Steel is awesome!
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,Good action Good CG Good Actor Bad Story
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,Went in expecting not much and it shocked me. It was better than I expected. Lots of friends saw it prior and did not like it so I went thinking I was waisting my time. Nope pretty damg good!
"Jun 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I am not a Superman fan; I don't hate him I just think he is too...super. On top of being nearly invincible the guy can turn back time, people! Wrong order at Starbucks? Gets shit on by a bird? Does a few laps around the world and someone else is having their day ruined with a ""Shit√® Latte on the Fly."" However, that doesn't mean I don't like to give Superman a chance. I love the potential of his story but I don't feel it has been serviced properly thus far (sorry, Bryan Singer). So imagine my excitement after hearing that a reboot of the Superman story is being serviced √° la The Dark Knight Trilogy and being written, produced, and composed by David S. Goyer, Christopher Nolan, and Hans Zimmer, respectively?! Oh, Zack Snyder's directing? Watchmen (2009) is one of my favorite superhero movies; he's capable-I'm on board.

Itching to see it, I took time out of my work day just to run down to the Hollywood Arclight theatre to reserve a free advanced screening (the premiere actually). I donned fancy maroon skinny jeans (closest red thing I had), dorky glasses and a bowtie for a hipster Clark Kent vibe that surprisingly no one picked up on. I even bought the $5 Arclight ""gourmet"" mango jalape√±o hot dog because I was like ""You know what, it's a special occasion-I'm going to fall in love with Superman today!"" The lights dimmed, the 3D glasses went on, the movie played, and...I walked out of the theatre so silent and unemotional...I hadn't been so disappointed by a film in a long time. I'm sorry, guys. They failed.

Man of Steel is a lackluster blockbuster, a cacophonous CGI fest that fails to earn any of its epic moments, as well as its emotional ones, having been voided of any wit or charm due to the catering of Snyder's obsession with spectacle over substance. I cannot believe how boring this film is, and that's saying a lot when the CGI and overall look of the film is gorgeous and top notch, they really do shine, but the same heart in the action sequences is lost in the coldness of Goyer's screenplay. The dialogue in general is really quite generic, any trace of truly unique and defining quotes can be found right in the trailers, and Snyder's apparent fast tracking of these quiet scenes only adds to the feeling of epic-for-epic's sake in all of the set pieces, thus rendering the action meaningless and silly.

Right at the beginning, only after about 5 mins, Snyder starts the show with an awkward heist and chase sequence on the planet Krypton. Superman's biological father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) flies on a Kryptonian mini-dragon while spaceships and and the planet around him are falling apart and exploding,he dives in this hibernation tank filled with edamame Kryptonian babies to grab this mystical skull thing, he's jumping off from insane heights, all to show that he's sending his son to Earth. An insane amount of information whizzing passed us for no apparent reason but to say ""Hey, look, our CGI doesn't suck."" Then of course in the final act, which I can confidentially say was the loudest, longest, bang-for-your-buck stretch of just utter CGI mayhem I've witnessed in a film, all sense falls to shit. This is where Snyder says ""Remember all that strong foundation we established in the beginning of the film to work up to this point? No? Good, just sit back and get sense raped."" In all fairness, the one thing I really, really loved in this film are the fights Superman has with General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his other officers, specifically Faora (Antke Traue)-damn does she kickass! The altercations are furious and relentless with these super aliens throwing and punching each other across towns and into buildings and with lightning speed; imagine a steel box with indestructible bullets being shot into them. Again, the scenes are not earned, but they do provide the film with its single most definitive Superman experience.

Another big disappointment is the way they decided to handle telling Superman's backstory as a child, a move I was not expecting prior. In the trailer we knew they were going to cover his days as a kid and teenager, and I was under the impression we would go through that experience first and catch up with him as an adult later-nope. When the Kryptonian pod carrying baby Superman is shown in space heading to earth, the scene cuts immediately to grown up Clark Kent working on the crab boat, and from then on his childhood moments are told as flashbacks; chopped up into pieces and spread out throughout the beginning and middle to help explain or fill in gaps. It's a frustratingly annoying move especially since the order of the flashbacks are not chronological, and because they go by so quickly there isn't time for our connection to settle -this isn't Lost, guys, you got 15 mins, not 6 seasons, to give us a coherent childhood story that is being pressed by 2 hours of action. Oh, I see why they had to do that now.

Despite the soulless mess of a script, the casting is very much on point despite the fact that most of the side characters are underused. Henry Cavill is excellent as Superman; he's got the charm, the stature, and just enough acting chops to sell the kind demeanor and inner torment our hero is characterized with, but it's unfortunate the script has him spending too much time on his past than his interaction with the aliens (humans). Michael Shannon is phenomenal as General Zod (props to the costume department by the way for inspiring Kryptonian military armor) while Amy Adams makes for a a more aggressively determined Lois Lane although her character really could have been given more of and edge and wit to bounce off the adorable Clark Kent. Laurence Fishburne is in here as Perry White, Editor in Chief of the Daily Planet , and Harry Lennix as Army General Swanwick, both of whom are given way too much screen time for the diddly squat their characters really contribute. It's a very talented cast that is brought down by a poor script.

Last but not least (trust me there's plenty to debate about in this film, from the little things to the big things) we have Hans Zimmer's score-the true star of the film. It's epic-ly amazing, simple as that. Like The Dark Knight Trilogy and Inception (2010), the score is a haunting yet hopeful spread of thunderous percussion accompanied by a weighted, ominous brass line, now accompanied by a driving string section that makes for quite the iconic Superman melody (Click Here for a Listen!) Zimmer is nothing short of brilliance and has created a sound exclusively for the epic movie; when this kicks in as Superman blitzes Zod from side harpooning him through two gargantuan, concrete, cylindrical, factory thingies? That chill isn't a pervert feeling you up, that's a Zimmer score making sweet love to your ears. As for the sound effects department? Guys tone it down...this is the first time in the history of my moviegoing journey that I've come out of a theatre with my ears ringing-true story.

Man of Steel, despite that the movie truly sucks as a whole, will undoubtedly burn the box office to ashes this weekend and despite this review you'll probably go see it out of curiosity. I say go see it to witness it for yourselves, after all this hype you owe it to yourself to know for sure. As of writing this review, the tomatometer on Rotten Tomatoes has it at 60% out of 81 reviews, which is still early, but should give you a good idea about whether or not you'll fly with this flick (laugh at the pun)."
"Jun 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This is a ""B-""(80marks). 2D cinema. This is a remake of the story of  the second installment of the old Superman Trilogy but it wasn't better than the original version, though director Zack Snyder had tried his best to make it anew for the 21st century audience. I like the old version a lot more than this new reboot. It is still a good summer movie though if you still want to believe in Superman. May be I have become too old to believe it or it is just that the movie isn't great enough to keep up with my age."
"Jun 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,"For a part of this movie I was truly interested, but for the rest it changed to a mindless action movie abandoning all story and character development.  Henry Cavil makes a good superman but a less than believable Clark Kent. Zack Snyder's directing Is very good although the script could have been better.  The amount of action in this movie makes it hard to watch although it was enjoyable to an until every scene in the movie was driven by action.  I felt that superman's and Lois Lanes romance was rushed. Michael Cannon's Zod was good but not great, his motives made sense and that's what made the character believable.  With all the action in the movie there is little to no comedic relief.  Good movie to pick up at redbox but not worth a movie theatre experience."
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"I really loved this movie and thought it did a lot of things right.  First, the casting was perfect...  Second, the story was good and solid... Third, they made the ""right"" kind of changes to the story.  I like Lois being smarter (previously the whole I can't tell Clark and Superman are the same people crap).  The biggest weakness was the over kill on fight scenes...  They could have cut 30 minutes off or developed the relationship between Superman and Lois...  I anticipate a sexual with Lex..."
"Jun 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Making a Superman film is no easy task. Throughout time this iconic character has developed into a near indestructible god of a man, lacking any of the characters flaws that add humanity into the seemingly endless supply of caped crusaders entering the box office as of late. Who better to take on the challenge of creating the ""Man of Steel"" than Christopher Nolan, Zach Snyder, and David S. Goyer? The group is no stranger to adapting comic books for the big screen with producer Christopher Nolan and screenwriter David S. Goyer having worked together on the ultra-successful Dark Knight trilogy and Director Zack Snyder directing graphic novel adaptations of ""300"" and ""Watchmen."" So it should come as no surprise that audience expectations are at an all-time high for a Superman reboot, especially following the colossal train wreck that was ""Superman Returns.""

Audiences are looking for the Dark Knight duo of Nolan and Goyer to inject the same intricacy, conflict, and dark tone that resonated through the Batman reboot into the latest Superman feature... and the they somewhat deliver. ""Man of Steel"" never quite reaches the same level of poignant heaviness as the Dark Knight trilogy and for good reason. Superman and Batman are distinctively different and as such should be approached from different angles. Where Batman is hurt, human, and scarred from the loss of his parents causing him to seek vengeance against the criminal underbelly of Gotham, Superman is inhuman and near-perfect. Although Superman also lost his parents, he was taken in by a loving family who infused him with the values of honor, courage and self-sacrifice. He is in essence a symbol of hope. Zach Snyder honors this version of Superman, paying homage to the Golden Age of comic books while injecting it with a sense of modernism.

The film opens with a tiresomely long preamble illuminating the all-too-familiar origin story of Jor-El (Russell Crowe) launching his newborn son Kal-El across the stars to Kansas as his home planet of Krypton is on the brink of destruction and how military leader General Zod (Michael Shannon) is imprisoned in the Phantom Zone after an unsuccessful coup. Despite the intro feeling a bit lengthy, it does offer Snyder the opportunity to indulge his love for flashy, effects-driven scenes by creating a world full of otherworldly creatures and Krypton's elaborate science before the planet implodes in a bombardment of fire and brimstone, courtesy of production designer Alex McDowell and an army of computer effects artists. The introduction is bold and exudes a sense of confidence as if Snyder is daring the audience to question the plausibility of Krypton's lead scientist racing ahead of biomechanical flying machines on the back of a giant dragonfly-like creature..... but you won't.

Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) first appears in uncharacteristic fashion as a brooding loner in his mid-twenties (complete with a full beard) wandering across America, leaving behind a trail of good deeds, in an attempt to find his place in the world. A series of flashbacks show Clark's childhood where his parents, Jonathan (Kevin Costner) and Martha (Diane Lane), help him to cope with his new-found powers while encouraging him to keep his abilities hidden from a world that is not ready to accept him. It is here that you feel the Nolan touch as Clark must deal with the inner conflict of keeping himself concealed from the world or using his powers to help those in need. Eventually Pulitzer Prize- winning journalist Lois Lane (Amy Adams) tracks down the man behind these good deeds and agrees to keep his secret after realizing the implications of life on other planets being discovered.

Things finally get rolling as General Zod and his followers escape the Phantom Zone and arrive at Earth, demanding the return of one of their own, Kal-El. Of course the vast majority of Earth is unaware of the presence of superhuman beings from distant planets and the United States military is all too willing to turn him over. Inevitably, the two clash in a series of over-sized, action-packed battles that stretch the limits of CGl. Some of the action sequences seem to borrow from the directing styles of Roland Emmerich and Michael Bay with large portions of Smallville and Metropolis lying in the wake of the two evenly-matched titans. Vehicles are thrown about like rag dolls and giant skyscrapers shatter to the ground in a menagerie of warped glass to the beat of Hans Zimmer's thumping score, but the scenes mostly avoid the sour aftertaste associated with Bay-esque pyrotechnics. The only downfall of these eye-popping action scenes, which dominate at least the last third of the film, is that they overshadow any real attempt at character development.

The all-star cast does their best to even out the at times too-serious tone of the movie. Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe play Clark's two fathers, adding a level of heaviness to the film, especially Costner who in a scene exemplifies the meaning of self-sacrifice to save his adopted son from revealing his secret. Henry Cavill does a solid job of donning the role of the most well-known superhero of all time by choosing to underplay the part, opting for a sense of humility rather than Christopher Reeves' charisma. Amy Adams fills the role of Lois Lane well, but wouldn't suffer from a bit more humor. Clark and Lois' romance is only teased and I expect it will play more into a sequel. The always-reliable Michael Shannon really steals the show as Zod, adding over-the-top charisma and a greater depth to the character than that of Terrance Stamp. 

Finally at the close of the film, those light-hearted, signature Superman moments that were seemingly missing from the film, rear their head in a shared glance between two reporters at the Daily Planet; hinting at a more-than-likely sequel. Although ""Man of Steel"" suffers from a lack of wit and charm, this visually brilliant film has laid a solid foundation for a legacy of sequels that could really soar."
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel is awesome, not perfect but awesome. Yes sometimes it feels rushed and some characters feel underdeveloped but once the wheels start moving, you're in for a good time!"
"Jun 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,It went way too 'transformers' for the last hour
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"MAN OF STEEL is a complete superhero-movie. A a giant sci-fi movie, assembled in an intriguing way. In the end, we will join Him in the Sun."
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,Fantastic!  Best superhero reboot ever!  The action scenes were fantastic.  As we're the special effects and the acting.   It takes itself more seriously than the Christopher Reeve Superman films which shows a different side to our favourite man of steel.  Far more successful than last years Spider-Man reboot (which was okay).  This is highly underrated.  Go and see it!
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"very very good in 3d, alot of action"
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"A fun movie, glad I got to see it on the big screen!"
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,I was impressed with not only the quality of SFX in this movie but the acting as well. They could have cut out about 15 minutes or so and not lost anything important. This is why I gave 4 stars...it just went on longer than it should have. Great and exciting film to watch and I definitely recommend it to all my friends.
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"It's different for"" Superman"" , but different is just what he needed all this time. All you critics downing this film need to lighten up and bask in this film's creativity and ability to bring a darker mood than the previous attempts at a ""Superman"" movie. Critics did the same to ""Batman Begins"" ...... Now look!!! It's the prologue to one of the most epic trilogy's to date."
"Jun 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,Snyder makes one of the greatest superhero a mediocre...
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,nice twist with new tech. excellent cast.
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"Let's get right to the questions that most need answering. Yes, it's a terrific film. Yes, it was worth remaking. Yes, Henry Cavill, till now best known for playing Theseus in ""Immortals,"" has nailed the role of Superman. To the point, aside from some visual effects overload in the last reel, this is the Superman movie fans have wanted to see and that newcomers to the longtime superhero will dig. Nolan and Snyder, along with scriptwriter David S Goyer, have created a plausible context for the introspection and self-doubt , in Goyer, Nolan and director Zack Snyder's new take on the origin story, the Clark/Kal dichotomy is not a contrast between a spectacled clown and a knight-in-primary-colour-armour, it is between a Kryptonian and an Earthling: a child of two worlds, one deceased, one floundering. Now, about those effects in ""Man of Steel."" I'm giving them an extra ""E"" for ""excessive."" But that's not a complaint, the action in ""Man of Steel"" is top tier, thanks to some truly jaw-dropping visual effects work from Weta Digital. It is without exaggeration to say that you have never seen superhuman fisticuffs on this level or scale-ever. The last act of 'Man of Steel' is out of control. It' entertaining, it's dramatic, it's actions pack and with a very well written and engaging story, so what else would anyone asks for from a summer blockbuster? Oh and BTW, yes this film is EPIC!!!!"
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"excellent,action packed reboot"
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,The best action movie this year!
"Jun 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,It's soooooooo long...too much back story...and I don't need to see childbirth or baby peen in 3D.
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,Man of Steel explains everything necessary about Superman
"Jun 13, 2013",POSITIVE,Yes it's loud but it is the Superman film I have waiting for. No more Emo-Supes.
"Jun 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"El Hombre de Acero: Yo la defino como el Superman que todos quer√≠an ver. La pel√≠cula es fren√©tica, llena de acci√≥n, destructiva, ruidosa y definitivamente espectacular. Visualmente deslumbrante con magn√≠ficos efectos visuales. Henry Cavill como Kal-El llena pantalla y se siente c√≥modo, era lo que se requer√≠a despu√©s el anterior intento. Amy Adams, como Lois Lane, tambi√©n nos brinda la que para mi es la mejor actuaci√≥n de la pel√≠cula. Otros sobresalientes son Kevin Cotsner, Michael Shannon y Antje Traue. En general hay actuaciones. La banda sonora definitivamente es lo mejor de la pel√≠cula, eleva las im√°genes al nivel √©pico, magnifica m√∫sica de Hans Zimmer. Los puntos m√°s d√©biles son el gui√≥n y la direcci√≥n. El gui√≥n no es redondo, entiendo lo que quer√≠an brindar, pero me parece que se pasaron con la dosis de destrucci√≥n y no quedan algunas decisiones tomadas en la trama, la direcci√≥n es bastante regular. Pero lo importante es que no hay grandes huecos. Se siente bien, es un gran entretenimiento que busca dejarnos al borde de la silla en sus m√°s de 2 horas que se pasan como el superh√©roe, volando. Para los que miren hacia La Liga de la Justicia, les digo que hay algo perteneciente a Wayne Enterprises en Man Of Steel. Por ultimo a los padres: Este Superman no es para ni√±os."
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Best Superman movie BY FAR!!!!! Henry Cavill is perfect, every bit as good as Christopher Reeve. I can't decide which movie I like best this year so far...Star Trek or Man of Steel...hhhmmmmm. I have to contemplate more. But while I contemplate more....do yourselves a favor and go watch an enjoyable Superman without all the hokey pokey lovey dovey stuff. Pure adrenaline and octane with a touch of character sprinkled in! I've already seen it twice."
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,An epic Superman movie! An epic retelling of the Man of steel story. I can't till he meets the Dark knight. PS Hans Simmer does a great job with the score!
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,I plan on flying to see this
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,awesome awesome awesome loved the movie the only CG problem I have is him in the fire it look to fake but othere then that highly recommend to others and def can watch it again way better then others by far
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel was an awesome movie. Everyone of the actors and actresses did a great job, especially Michael Shannon and Henry Cavill. The only problem I have with the movie is to be expected, as a lot of people have said, his past seems rushed, but, making a movie over 2 and a half hours, is hard to get people to swallow, and there was just too much to tell, so much in fact that it should have been spread out over 2 movies. But if they had done that, the first movie would only have a few minutes in the end, where we actually get to see Superman. So that being said, I think they did an awesome job getting everything into one movie. There is one other thing I didn't care for, but I don't want to ruin anything for those who haven't seen it, and no, for those who did, it had nothing to do with Zod, he was awesome. For the 2 little things that I didn't care for, I cant give it a perfect score, so my rating for Man of Steel, is a, 8.5"
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,This is the treatment our iconic superhero needed for years
"Jun 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,Superman isn't himself in this movie big build up for such a dull ending but I liked action

"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,really really good movie.  it doesn't deserve a rotten score from critics. I mean hell Attack of the Clones has a higher rating?! that's baloney!
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,This version looks good
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,really good movie. really enjoyed it. looking forward to the next installment
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,amazing movie i wanna watch it   again
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,I really like this movie. Thought it was a nice reboot. So sad about  Metropolis.
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Now that's how you make a superman movie! 5 mins into the film and it was already 100 times better then Superman Returns.
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Simply stunning. I was engulfed by the film from start  to finish. Teared up in parts and had chills down my spine from the amazing story. Definitely the Superman film we have always dreamed of. And will be the blockbuster movie of the summer.
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Finally, the Superman movie I've always wanted to see!"
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Outstanding movie, loved it from start to finish."
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel packs a huge punch. Make that a million punches for that matter. This is movie is the perfect depiction of action. I am however biased towards the action for I watched this movie in D-Box. I did notice how there was nonstop action towards the end but D-Box eased me of that pain. Thank you D-Box. I enjoyed the movie yet I feel like Superman's story was not fully told. These however are just minor flaws. At the end of the day, I felt good about this movie. I came out smiling and had a great time and that's what really matters. Loads of fun. D-Box!"

"Jun 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I didn't enjoy this one, I wanted to but didn't. Zod had a better character arc than Superman in this one. The human parents seem rather wasted compared to the previous adaptations of the source material. So far I maintain the Smallville series had better heroism and patriotism than this movie."

No stars: Missing something. 
1 star: Henry Cavill
1 star: Amy Adams"
"Jun 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It took five viewings for me to finally decide upon the proper rating for this and last night I finally let go of my intense dislike of two major battle sequences (Smalltown & Metropolis, especially Metropolis with all of it's shameless 9/11 PTSD-flashback imagery) and chose to focus on it's strengths.  The casting.  The performances (especially Michael Shannon as Zod).  The visual effects.  The art direction (everything Kryptonian is beautiful, especially their tech).  The score (Hans Zimmer strikes again).  Nothing will ever be as perfect as the first two Christopher Reeves ""Superman""s, but this deserved more praise than it got.  But perhaps I'm just still smarting after the brass-doorknobs-in-the-pillowcase beatdown that was ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and this felt like a geeky olive branch..."
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is a very solid superhero movie. The fight scenes were fantastic, the action was fantastic, Superman had depth and was very humane, it had a decent villain, and the direction by Zack Snyder was solid. Henry Cavill did an excellent job as Kal-El, and was almost as good as Christopher Reeve. Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner were great fathers, and Diane Lane was great as Martha Kent. The pacing is almost perfect, though there was maybe too much action. Michael Shannon's Zod wasn't as good as Terence Stamp's Zod. I do wish Lois Lane and Clark Kent had some more chemistry, that she didn't know he was Superman the whole time. I think that will take away from the classic banter of the earlier films. Overall this is a very satisfying movie, though not one of the best superhero movies. It's definitely the best Superman movie since the second Christopher Reeve film."
"Jun 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,Repetitive action sequences and cliche childhood and relationships make this highly anticipated film a bit of a disappointment.
"Jun 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Though it lacks in story, Man of Steel is visual  spectacle with great action pieces"
"Jun 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I really wanted to love it, but it was above average at best."
"Jun 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"reat vision for the movie, the execution was average at best though. Russell Crowe was the highlight for me, the poor pacing and development were the lowlights. 

The action was fun, but cluttered at moments. The special effects were beyond impressive most of the film, they just became a bit repetitive toward the end. The acting was decent overall, I just feel like the writing hindered any chance at really connecting with any character with the exception of Russell Crowe's Jor-El. Superman felt too distant far too often throughout, which is a shame because the surface of Cavill's performance wasn't bad, but it just felt like a shallow version of the man wearing the ""S"" on his chest who could lay a whoopin' and catch falling people really well. Fortunately Cavill laid a solid foundation for himself to solidify his role as a promising Superman in the future.

Overall it was a fun watch, though I'm hoping for a deeper second installment that paces better than Man of Steel. Maybe tone down the crashing skyscrapers and amp up the character arching to something more than just long stares and sudden expressions of, ""Hey! Maybe we should stop shooting at the guy trying to save all of us!"". 

6.5/10"
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Epic AWESOMENESS!!!!
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,I don't understand the low rating on here!
"Jun 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,the first half is a wonderful origin story. the second is shit covered up in CGI overkill... watch it on DVD.
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Welcome to the Planet!
"Jun 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This movie was a little too long...About 2 hrs and 28 min. too long.  There were some people that even walked out during it.  The worst comic book movie ever was Batman & Robin.  Last year's Spider-Man reboot and this Superman are just about as bad.  Cavill is okay as Superman, but the acting from the rest of the cast was pathetic and full of boring speeches about Superman's destiny.  Iron Man 3 sucked, but Man Of Steel has delivered a new level of sucking for this summer.  I wish that we went to see This Is The End again instead."
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Histoire je disais assez basic (C'est un retelling de la s√©rie Smallville de A √† Z)... mais l'action... c'est EPIIIIIIICCCCCC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC!! Imagine l'anime Dragonball (version live-action mais avec 300 millions dbudget pour un film) ou Gurenlaghan que les bad dudes + superman sont tellement puissant que juste faire un punch peut faire une explosion nucl√©aire ou un crat√®re.. c'est dans cet √©pic proportion la que l'on voit l'action!!!!!!!! c'est mongol, c'est overthetop extreme.... MAIS MERDE QUE C JUSTE AWESOME DE VOIR SA EN LIVE ACTION!! Donc ce film je le recommande √† ceux qui veulent voir des MOST AMAZING ACTION-SETPIECE dans un Comic-book movie!! Il faut que je rajoute de quoi.. les effets-sp√©ciaux... c'est dans les plus r√©ussis que j'ai vue √† vie.. c'est m√™me spectaculaire!"
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Everything I wanted from a new Superman. Less focus on the ""how do we kill an invincible man"" and more focus on the human aspects of the Man of Steel."
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,great story from start to beginning.  we get a better understanding of how advance krypton was.  how it really feels as an outsider to try to fit in. love this movie.
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"""Man of Steel"" is a much better film than many critics are giving it credit for.  Yes it has some pacing issues (it does NOT move too slowly in the middle of the film... rather too fast).  Due to that, some character development gets lost, but by the end of the film the story and the audience is on the same page.  Part of the problem with the pacing is that the filmmakers tried to fit too much into this film.  Sometimes they sacrificed some of the developmental scenes in order to squeeze for action in (the result is not necessarily a bad thing, although it is something to you need to decide for yourself).  The film sets up for sequels (Superman does something at the end that I hope the writers will use to explore his character in future films).  As for the action, I don't think I have ever seen action like this before.  It is brutal and fighting that only two Kryptonians can engage in.  The filmmakers take full advantage of Superman's powers in the way that no other live action take on this character has ever done before.  You will not be disappointed.  As for the acting, it was awesome.  Snyder put together a stellar cast.  There was no weak link here.  Henry Cavill was an awesome Superman (or should I just say Kal-El or Clark Kent).  I was really blown away with his American accent.  I couldn't tell one bit that he is British.  Amy Adams was also a really good Lois Lane.  Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner stole the scenes they were in.  They both gave really heartfelt and believable performances.  They were both the heart of the film, and Clark's conscience.  They also had the best dialogue too.  Michael Shannon's General Zod is one of the better villains.  They didn't make him an all-out villain.  You can sympathize with him and his cause.  Shannon portrays him well.  Lastly, I want to mention Diane Lane as Martha Kent.  All I want to say is that she is a butt-kicking mother.  You don't mess with her or her son."
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Nice character development and storyline. It was sometimes difficult to keep up with all the action going on, but overall it was great and kept you on the edge of your seat. This is a ""must see"" for any Superman fan, or comic book fan for that matter."
"Jun 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,could have been a lot better didn't like how the storey jumped back and forward. but still worth a watch
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie guys. This movie. Go see this movie. I wasn't sure how it would turn out with Zach snyder's direction but having seen it I am glad they gave the job to him. Everyone's performances, the aesthetic of the film and the worlds they created were beautiful, emotional, and inspiring. I cannot praise this movie enough. Another home run for the DC universe."
"Jun 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,"As usual, Snyder's visuals are wonderful. But the film truly fails mostly due to poor writing. The acting is awkward and the camera work is a bit to unsteady. The action is intense but very repetitive."
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Totally awesome movie. Zach Snyder did an outstanding job of blending super effects into a action packed movie that still manages to humanize an alien super hero through a great origin/coming of age tale. I really respect the fact that through the characters comments, action, and origin story, Synder unabashedly brands Superman an all-American hero. I can't understand the negative reviews from critics, they're either joyless, have zero sense of nostalgia, or communists. Totally nerded out on this one, great flick, go see it immediately!"
"Jun 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"What a strange movie, I really don't know what way to rate this so I'll just settle for a good, not great but not bad either. The editing and jumping from scenes was very poor and made the whole movie disjointed. You can tell its Snyder's movie entirely, Nolan had very little involvement. I had such high expectations for this film after seeing the trailers but it is definitely not at all like the trailers portray. From an actors point of view, all were very good. Cavill was exceptional as superman, but had a poor script to work with as Clark. This was the main weakness in the film, script and editing. As I said at the start, a strange movie to explain and review. Hopefully these issues will be ironed out for the sequel."
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Was by far the best Superman movie to date. It wasn't the superman everyone knows but a more down to earth if you will. Cavill was a very good choice as superman. The scenes on Krypton and the beginning are something we haven't ever really seen only just imagined. I thought it was overall the best movie at the best time. Clark's old happy go Lucky almost idiotic self replaced by someone more like everyone of us.
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,SAW IT WOULD RECOMMEND IT.
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"A different take on superman, and I loved that. Michael Shannon killed it as Zod. The only thing that gets me about this movie and also with all super hero movies is how much destruction happens and the possible lives lost."
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Fantastic action, incredibly realistic story and amazing acting, especially from Crowe and Adams. Go see it now!"
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"I have never given 5 stars to a movie before. Did I give it because it was perfect? No. It was because there was so much anticipation, so much hype, it was difficult to keep my own personal expectations in check. I sat in the theater and in 2 1/2 hours I experienced something I have not experienced in a long time, movie magic. Thank you Man of Steel for the magic"
"Jun 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Beginning: Okay.
Middle: Eh. 
End: Cool."
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Fantastic reboot of a legend of a character. Seen it on DVD as the critics had bombed it to the death but realised that they were wrong. Superman looks convincing and characters are built to bind the story.
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,An action packed superhero film that may relies a bit too much on the typical superhero movie cliches.
"Jun 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,Slow.  I liked this superman.  Surprised Amy Adams made a good Lois.  Why do all super hero movies have to be too dark for kids who love them?  I do feel this is appropriate for my 9 yr old and am thankful.
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Freaking Action Packed Awesomeness
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Superman's return to the big screen is a grand spectacle. Humanizing an icon and turning into the world's hero is exactly what Zack Snyder has accomplished, and he's directed his best picture to date. Man of Steel has blown away the competition (that's you, Iron Man 3!) and DC is going to give Marvel a run for it's money!"
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,SUPERAWESOME!!! I LOVED IT!
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Anyone who didn't like this (or says they didn't to impress their hipster pals) is a soulless, joyless hack.This movie was a spectacle and I enjoyed every minute of it"
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"The movie doesn't give the audience the feeling of something never seen before, but delivers amazing action sequences, a plot that is deep enough, and a completely and welcome NEW Superman!"
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Looks like an epic reboot.
"Jun 4, 2013",POSITIVE,I want to see this movie!!!!
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"+Every action scene 
+The Visual are top notch
+The 2nd & 3rd act is non-stop action
- poorly paced at times and can get confusing"
"Jun 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The story wasn't as perfect as it could be, but all the actors did their jobs. I especially liked Kevin Costner's short but moving performance. His love as an adapted father was subtle, but powerful. All he wanted was the best possibility for his son who is from another planet. It gave me tears."
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"If you try to completely keep your mind in a world where there hasn't been a Superman film before this (as that's the direction they were going)...

Man of Steel is a pretty solid film. The cast are excellent (Henry Cavill owns the part), the action is like something out of a comic book (which is pretty spectacular), there's humor despite what the critics are saying (some of it may be subtle, but the two times I've seen it - the audience were laughing). There are plenty of nods or Easter eggs to the comics and other DC characters which sets this up for a sequel or expanded movie universe (there is a sequel in pre-production, a Marvel-like series of films is planned leading to ""Justice League""). The pacing is just about right. 

If I had to sum it up in one line - ""The Superman film for the century""."
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,great film!!! I totally disagree with the score from critics. I think rotten tomatoes' reviewers don't like Snyder films
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"those fight scenes. Is my only comment. let your peeps make you watch that movie, I'm sure they will... hope"
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,two big thumbs up!!!
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"They finally got it right. Forget about all the other countless versions they've done these past couple of years. THIS is the version that matters. Absolutely phenomenal in every way. Two aspects that I really enjoyed the most was the beginning and the end. They let you fill in the blanks. We all know the story of Superman. We don't care to see the storyline again of how he grew up or what happens during his news reporter years. They give us little tidbits of his childhood, and brief explanation once he discovers his real father and where he is from, but nothing to drag on about. It only built up your understanding on small elements of dialogue from the present. The beginning gave the movie a lot of depth by showing Kripton's storyline before it implodes so it was executed very well. All of it from beginning to end was done beautifully in every way. I loved it. It deserves the highest rating it can get because THIS is the Superman movie that will go down in history as being truly amazing. GO SEE IT!"
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,Really good first movie to start a new franchise. Definitely a fast-paced action extravaganza from start to finish. The cast was excellent and helps to really sell a great plot.
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,This is a great start to a new DC world!
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,I would say it is an awesome movie mostly because people predict how it's going to turn out and they were wrong. So I say it should be a must see movie.
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great movie. More than what was expected from a Zack Snyder film. A little too much on the devastation, and that's the only reason it got 4/5. This was needed approach 
to the iconic character."
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,was an awesome movie
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,I can't believe some of these critics. This IS the superman movie everyone wanted. Go see it for yourself. ALOT of action ALOT of heart. Fantastic.
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,Very good movie. Especially awsome effects. Not a lot of funny moments but a really great Superman movie. Much better than Superman Returns
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,Best movie ever seen
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,best movie of the year by far
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"Brilliant supporting cast, fantastic writing, fights get a little tedious."
"Jun 3, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I am floored by how bad this was. This movie really hooked me with its trailer and talent behind and in front of the camera, but the writing was bad, the characters were one dimensional, the camera wouldn't stop shaking for no reason, the colors were all dark and grey, the destruction/action was meaningless and endlessly long, and worst of all the filmmakers got the character of superman completely wrong. This was one of the worst Superman films I have ever sat through."
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,Greatest Superhero movie way better than avengers
"Jun 3, 2013",NEGATIVE,"C-.


Blinded by its own spectacle, its lack of character depth makes Man of Steel an experience without layers, making the action sequences underwhelming, non-memorable, and uninteresting."
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"Every time I watch this movie it gets greater. Zack Snyder really has a fantastic style, which makes Superman feel cool again."
"Jun 3, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Just wasn't that good...great effects, but the fight scenes were repetitive and went on and on and on.  Story jumped too much between past and present day."
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"Critics know not of what they're talking about in this case, this movie has a great start and buildup at the start of the movie, explaining in a well thought out way the birth and creation of superman. And the follow-up in the rest of the movie to this buildup is a large scale battle, as is the case in other superhero movies that have received wide scale popular ratings, so I don't understand these critiques. Great movie! And whoever made the advert for this movie deserves an advert award of some sort. Fantastically well made advert for a great movie!"
"Jun 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,This review sums up my thoughts: http://reiddesigns.tumblr.com/post/53593082422/man-of-steel-review
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome father's day movie - we all loved it!
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"Really nice effects and Michael Shannon is stunning in this, a must see"
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"The plot was good, but the action was intense!"
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,My favorite movie by far this year!! This is the Superman movie I've always wanted to see.  I love how they shook up the mythology of Superman and there were quite alot of surprises in it.  And it has one of the BEST climaxes in a superhero movie ever!  The 3D was also fantastic!  Do yourself a favor and see this movie on as big of an Imax 3D screen as you can find!
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"Confusing at times, good action flick."
"Jun 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,The critics didnt like it bc superman didnt have underwear..... my main problem was the directing
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"All of the critics who said: ""Superman had no emotion"" or the more common: ""There is no strong female role in this movie"" are a few french fries short of a happy meal. Number 1, without giving away spoilers, Superman does show emotion, so much so that he screams and cries at a couple riveting points in the movie. And the idiots who want a ""Strong female model""........I wonder why you are expecting a strong female character in a movie called ""MAN of Steel""....And also, Amy Adams plays a very awesome Lois Lane. This movie will take your breath away and make you wish that you could just jump in the air and fly up, up and away."
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"An origin story that deals with heavy themes of the effects of morality, responsibility and vulnerability. It is a monumental success that sometimes gets bogged down with its pacing issues and with some lack of character development. This film ultimately is a success however, because of its intentionality to tell a story that sticks to a solid formula and executes it to the maximum extent."
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"I thought this movie was a great retelling of an old story. Not sure why people are being sooo hard on this one. The futuristic look and telling more of the story of where Kal-El came from I thought added a lot to the story. The cinematography was very well done, gets you in the action. The movie was a good fresh start to the series, a better story than the previous try."
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,Best movie of the summer
"Jun 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,A satisfying blockbuster with real-world sensibility and sci-fi fantasy elements.
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,Makes the Old superman movies look like Child playa. Very complete story true to the superman core.
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"While I thought the movie had its flaws especially concerning a tone that was a little too dark for Supes, overall it was a really good movie. It was extremely well cast and the Kryptonian aspects of the story line were great. I can't wait to see what direction the take with the sequel. Some people have commented that it had too much fighting and destruction, but the biggest complaint about Superman Returns was the lack of fighting. So it just goes to show you that some people are never happy."
"Jun 3, 2013",POSITIVE,Top drawer move. Darker and supstance to the story. Rearly good performances by supporting cast.
"Jun 1, 2013",POSITIVE,"There were some scenes that seemed forced, but overall the movie was great. New found faith in the Superman movie franchise."
"Jun 1, 2013",POSITIVE,"A great new take which could have done trying to be the best of two franchises a little else.

Potential spoilers ahead:

To be honest right now the only ones I've seen before hand... Or that I can remember somewhat well enough to judge that I really liked where the original and Returns. Never seen IV and I can remember III being the first one I did see but I barely remember it now. II for reasons I'll soon elaborate I did also like but felt was seriously overrated.  

Didn't see much of the other tv shows, saw Lois and Clark a few times, maybe the same for one of the old cartoon versions. I did get into Smallville after someone I knew years ago suggested it and I did take to it. 

So that's my breakdown of what I've seen before hand, not sure if I ever read any the comics though but moving on from that what did I think of the movie.

So one of, if not the most iconic superhero is the latest to get a reboot. There's is no denying that whatever you thought of the previous movies, TV shows, comics or whatever they were gonna be going into this with pretty big shoes to fill. And as I someone who went in with more prior knowledge than I've did with most superhero movies this was a brilliant new take.

Henry Cavil is no Christopher Reeve of course, but he does general make the role his own. Amy Adams I felt made for a enjoyable Lois Lane who much like every other one I've seen was in someway asking for trouble in her methods to get her big story. 

Right from the start of this film it wastes no time in sucking you in. We see more of Kypton than we're probably ever seen on screen. It sets up the world were Superman came from nicely and although it's destruction did feel really prolonged it all plays a big part in most of the later parts of the film. I did like the way it was set up, you feel more of a emotional connection to the El's saying goodbye to their son and their way of life. Russell Crowe made for a great Jor El too.

The action, social effects, 3D were amazing. The surround sound really added for a amazing experience, you could sense that everyone went all out for this behind the scenes and it does pay off. 

I got to admit and this relates to what I said about Superman II, this Zod I felt was possibly the best one yet. There I said it. Here we have a complex character who wants the best for the people he's leading even though his methods are extreme. The one everyone raved about I felt was bland, 1 dimensional and frankly I couldn't watch and keep a straight face even during the non comic relief moments. Here I... Well I don't know if I would say I felt very intimidated but still felt sorta tense by him at times. (Smallville had a Zod I also felt was an improvement but looking back on it i still wouldn't call him a great villain though. But was great to see one who felt more human than he was (actually more than this one))

The rest of the cast were also good too, like Kevin Costner as his Earth Dad whose name I can't remember and the younger Clark's. Though no one stood out as bad there were a few I wished I saw more or less off though.

But this is not to say that there are some big flaws with this. Right away there were times were I felt it was trying too hard to be the Nolan Batman movies. Ok Nolan was involved in his but the tone and pacing felt choppy and either too much or not enough at times. 

I liked seeing a Clark Kent who much like Bruce Wayne in Batman Begin's went exploring the world trying to hide from who he really was but the tone felt wrong at times for Superman and well it wasn't developed enough. Some parts ended way too soon and  could have developed the character more if it last longer. Plus it was too non-linear at times to feel like it was going somewhere. (To be fair most of it does... Eventually) 

Like going, here's what happens next... Oh wait there was something that happened years ago we all know about but haven't retold yet. (And now we briefly have here's what happened in the present next) There were parts later on that kinda dragged on too much as well.

I guess in some ways it could seen as a shame this didn't come out before Batman Begins and instead of Superman Returns.

These things I pointed out are at the end of the day kinda nitpicky I guess, most of the time I was actually dazzled to the point if it picked up the pace a little bit more story wise or spent more time with the character development parts I would have let it go.

In all despite some flaws I did enjoy this, deco one of the best superman... Anything's I've seen. I do want to see where the sequels will go from here cause I did enjoy the new Superman universe it set up. So the flaws I could forgive it for, cause it had a lot to live up too. Especially the one key character not featured but was referenced in someone easy to not notice way. So seeing Superman fly, the action scenes, Kypton's destruction in 3D... Wow. One great addition that's for sure.

So in all I did love this movie and is worth checking out for a fun filled experience. 9/10"
"Jun 1, 2013",POSITIVE,"What a great film, great cast, great story line and a great homage the original story. Well worth seeing although a num bummer at two hours and 30 minutes."
"Jun 1, 2013",POSITIVE,"Wow! Now this what a superman movie is all about!  Action pact, outstand effects!  A must see!!!"
"Jun 1, 2013",NEUTRAL,It wasn't a bad movie at all but it just didn't measure up to my standards for a Super man movie. I can't get over the beard thing.
"Jun 1, 2013",POSITIVE,"Wow, what a reboot this bad boy was. Love it."
"Jun 1, 2013",NEGATIVE,It exhausts more than it exhilarates.
"Jun 1, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I'm usually a sucker for superhero movies. But this, was terrible. Oh don't worry, I'm not going to just leave it at that, I shall proceed to go into every detail on why this movie was bad, and how it could've been so good.

Pacing: It's unbelievable how rushed this movie seemed. There wasn't a good balance between the characterization and the action/main plot. This movie could've been much better if there was about 20-30 minutes less action, and more amount of time allowing the audience to enjoy Lois Lane and Clark Kent's relationship. This movie really needed to slow down, and focus more on the development of Superman, rather than throwing him into a grandiose conflict with Zod.

Characterization: The movie completely assumed the audience is supposed to love Superman, because who the fuck shouldn't besides Michael Shannon? Well I fucking didn't because it didn't know how to get me to like him. It showed who he become, it showed me his morals, but it didn't show me his emotion and passion for why he did what he did. I think a good part of that goes to Henry Cavill's shitty acting. Do not argue with me because he's hot shit, he can't portray emotion or a remotely good character. The only thing that made me question him not being a Vulcan was when Kevin Costner, his Earth dad died, and he screamed. Side note. That scene was so dumb. It was directed so poorly. I mean I understand he needs to die, it's archetypal with superhero movies. Peter Parker and his dad, Bruce Wayne and his, pretty sure that happens in Thor too. But if I was Clark, I would've fucking run after my father whether or not he took a minute to nod his head not to.  I would've been completely satisfied if he ran after his limping father and it took him away, because that at least shows he cares about his father. 

Continuing on this, I felt like Clark Kent and Lois Lane had no screen time together with there actually being a romantic back tone. Like, I guess it sort of makes sense for her to feel this way, because you know, he kind of saved her fucking life. But when did he ever feel this way about her?! And they kissed?! Worst scene of the movie. ""They say after the first kiss it gets worse."" So tacky. 

Screenplay: I thought that this was a poorly written film. The dialogue was dumb, and at some points unnecessary. Like when Zod says ""Either you die, or I do,"" way to point out the fucking obvious we know. Then there were just some stupid, cheesy lines that were unnecessarily thrown in there. The movie never attempted to have comic relief. Well it did once at the very end, right after an action sequence that went on for about 45 minutes it seemed, when the girl said, ""Oh, I just thought he was hot."" I cried a little when other people laughed. 

Other things that grinded my gears: 

1. When people would people would put that 'S' port key thing into that slot, I didn't appreciate there being a physical version of Jor-El. And when he did show up when Clark Kent was in there, why didn't Jor-El acknowledge their relationship once?! This was the perfect opportunity to build on Clark's character. I thought it could've been cooler if maybe his face showed up in one of those cool 3D mirror things. 

2. How he got his suit. The only thing I had learned about Clark Kent was that he was a very soft-spoken person, who doesn't own up to his actions (which is most superheroes), and just wants to fit in with everyone else. But when his father gave it to him, it was so stupid because it made Kent look egotistical. I don't know how to describe it. It's not how it should be done! Superheroes make their costumes to mask their true identities! But this costume doesn't hide who he is, it just separates him from everyone else.HE should've come to the realization himself that he needed to wear a suit, rather than someone telling him to wear it because he's different. I personally think it would've been a lot more sick if he just fucked shit up in that Henley he was wearing. Fuck costumes that'd be awesome.

3. In that flashback when he pulled the kid and the bus out of the water, I think there should've been resolution with that fat red-headed kid and Clark. I mean, they exchange glances when flies through the ceiling of the diner, but how do we know that Clark knew that was him? We didn't. If sometime before shit broke loose that kid went and thanked him for saving his life when they were at this age, it could've been so cool. Because things like that, are things that reassure these heroes why they do what they do; knowing that have helped save lives.

Okay that's it that I hated. I guess I'll share what I liked. I loved Michael Shannon, because he's such a badass. I love how rather than typical villains say that they agree in the sense that they're trying to say that they're doing what's best, he admits that he and Superman are morally different. It shows how no matter what, he's not going to change, he doesn't give a fuck about humans. He's in it for the people for Krypton, he's loyal, fuck yeah. I honestly would've loved it so much more if he won. The visual effects were also good. But then again, the visual effects are just as good in every other Sci-fi movie nowadays. It's 2013, if you guarantee having a movie with good effects, please have a good story too.

I love Christopher Nolan, I love almost everything else he's done, but I'm not here to blame everything on Zack Snyder. Nolan fucked up. If he hasn't learned anything from making a superhero trilogy, you're supposed  to start slow, make more of an introductory film first, and have it build up to something like that, so we can like the characters before going into something like that. This movie deserves one star. With the amount of potential it had, it did not achieve any of it. That is all."
"Jun 1, 2013",NEUTRAL,expected more.  I wish I would have waited to watch it at the dollar movie theater.
"Jun 1, 2013",POSITIVE,Great reboot of Superman.  It's not the same old story and brings several twists that make it a unique storyline and fun to watch.
"Jun 1, 2013",NEGATIVE,bit rubbish not a superman film
"Jun 1, 2013",POSITIVE,"As a huge Superman fan I had some very specific things I wanted to see from this movie... some things I saw, others I did not, however, I would say this movie was far from a disappointment"
"Jun 1, 2013",POSITIVE,"Captivating. The graphics are incredible, Cavill nailed the Superman part. The only thing that really holds this film back is General Zod, he isn't convincing. It consists of quick and almost meaningless scenes that go all over the place. And one can only take so much of people being thrown through buildings. Other than that, this a new favorite of mine and it sits at like an 82 percent for me! I love this movie"
"Jun 1, 2013",POSITIVE,"This was exactly what I wanted out of a Superman film; heaps of Action (he did debut in Action Comics after all!) and a new take that discarded all of the old outdated silly elements.
Everything looked amazing, the performances were inspired the plot solid, and holy poop in a bag was Krypton awesome!"
"Jun 1, 2013",NEUTRAL,"What they got right, they nailed.  You can literally see how much passion went into trying to tell Clark Kent's story properly.  But unfortunately, the movie keeps getting distracted away from the really interesting and engaging Clark story to go mess around with a pedestrian sci-fi action plot that could have been condensed to a big 3rd act reveal, leaving more room for a fully-formed and relatable transformation from Clark Kent to Superman."
"Jun 1, 2013",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the critics I guess the action hurt their eyes or something. Man of Steel is awesome good cast, script, action was good did have some flaws but it more than makes up for it. Henry Cavill passes the test."
"Jun 1, 2013",NEGATIVE,An interesting start but then it becomes transformers without the robots.  With just a nice 5 minutes at the end. In summary:  too much fighting and not enough character development. (Though with some nice references to earlier films and a good performance by Kevin Costner.) This is definitely more akin to the rebooted Avengers than the rebooted Batman.
"Jun 1, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This movie is very flawed in its execution. SPOILER ALERT!

The beginning of the movie demonstrates how much young Clark cares for humans, so much so that he saves the ones he doesn't even like. Then, later he has epic battles with enemies in urban areas, being a big part of the destruction of skyscrapers and other buildings which contain lots of humans. Does he seem to care that the humans are likely dying, no not really(as long as Lois is okay). The Superman I grew up with would have done everything he could to minimize the damage to Metropolis, or try take the battle as far as he could from there. The battles were literally just supers throwing and punching eachother. This movie just wanted to throw a lot of destruction on the screen because of a misguided notion that we are all a bunch of idiots that just want the special effects and violence. I am surprised to say it, but Zack Snyder could have learned a lot from watching more of the teen drama, ""Smallville"". It survived and thrived many seasons with very little action. This movie lacked any sense of class."
"Jun 1, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Really portrayed the moral and ethical battle that Superman movies are known for. The fact that this has only made 4 million and Despicable Me has made 46 million just goes to show the intellectual decline of our society. It no longer wants to discuss matters of ethics or morality, but vampires that twinkle."
"Jun 1, 2013",POSITIVE,"Well done, let's go Justice League!"
"Jun 1, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie was awesome. Totally worth the money
"Jun 1, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Occasionally, Rotten Tomatoes gets it wrong. This is one of those times. WAY better than I thought it was going to be. I honestly couldn't care less about Superman. Has never interested me. But, with Snyder and most importantly Nolan at the helm, I had to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised by how engaged I felt. Lots of style, good acting, lots of action, good score. Man of Steel did a lot of things right. A negative I keep reading is that the movie lacked romance and humor: GOOD. No forced love angle and no one-liners that pop up in most Superhero movies that ruin the serious tone. (the only movie that gets away with it is Iron Man. That's it. The rest annoy me more than anything.) 

I want to reiterate the great acting. I think Cavill was perfect as Superman and had a wonderful supporting cast. Amy Adams was a great Lois Lane and I think the unforced Love angle helped let her be a stronger, more respectable character.

The only real criticism I have of the movie is in the beginning. I felt like Clark Kent's family's acceptance of his alien-origins was eerily un-confrontational. Hell, the whole world barely batted an eye when they found out that their world was actually inhabited by an alien. They were like: ""Ok. we got an alien. Looka that."" Very little panic or sense of fear in my opinion. I really felt like the World was wayyyy more ready to accept aliens than they were made out to be. Usually Superheroes have a long road before they are accepted by the world. Clark Kent accepted that he was savior of the world pretty fast, too. No signs of internal struggle over his new, HUGE responsibility. He just kind of became Superman in a matter of minutes."
"Jun 1, 2013",POSITIVE,"Some humor, some heart, lots of action."
"Jun 1, 2013",POSITIVE,It had to many flash back but still a cool.
"Jun 1, 2013",NEUTRAL,Great soundtrack.  Not sure how they didn't put enough characterization into a 2hour film. SuperMan just feels like cardboard. But a solid action blockbuster nevertheless
"Jun 1, 2013",POSITIVE,"Completely lived up to my high expectations! It was amazing, a must see"
"Jun 1, 2013",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie!  Saw 12:01am showing. 
Great action!  Good actors!  Nolan does it again!"
"Jun 1, 2013",POSITIVE,Seriously amazing! Up there with Avengers as best superhero movie!
"Jun 1, 2013",POSITIVE,"If you can't just sit down and enjoy a movie, then you are what is wrong with society. I have been overly excited for this movie since the day it was announced. I watched all the trailers, read all the extras, read the incoming reviews and on top of all of that, I was the first one in line for the Walmart Premier her on Kauai.  

The only thing I didn't do while going into this movie, was to criticize it. But just enjoy its wonder. And I walked out happy, and excited to see it again."
"Jun 1, 2013",POSITIVE,"One of the most exhilarating,thumping superhero movie made in the recent era , Man Of Steel hits all the right notes,terrific direction by Zack Snyder and the beautiful background score by Hans Zimmer makes this film a Terrific Watch !"
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,One of the best Superman movies
"May 31, 2013",NEGATIVE,Enough repeating the same story. This is just Superman 1 and 2 again. We all KNOW his origin story already.
"May 31, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I have never been disappointed with a film Christopher Nolan has backed up ever in my life until Man of Steel. The movie starts off strong with a big epic fight with Jor-El VS Zod's army. After that it takes the audience to a origin story of how Superman/Clark Kent became the way he is and what he is doing from numerous flashbacks that give the narrative a sloppy pacing. Zack Snyder's directing for fight scenes on the other hand was amazing as always and stayed away from the slow motion Matrix style he did with 300 and Sucker Punch. The movie has some touching moments but it doesn't flow well witht he placing of the action in the film especially in the second and third act of the film. Action scene after action but hey, we've been waiting for a Superman film where Superman gets to kick ass for a long ass time and Bryan Singers Superman Returns did nothing to fulfill that for us. The only thing that keep this film afloat is the over the top action that reminded me of a live action Dragon Ball Z film and the very strong acting from both of Superman's parents."
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"The best Superman movie Ive seen. Being as it is the only one Ive cared to see. Not a huge Superman fan, more of a Batman and Marvel fan. However while nowhere near the epicness of The Avengers, and the brilliance of The Dark Knight trilogy this movie gave Superman a fighting chance in todays comic book to cinema world. Costner, Crowe and Michael Shannon are brilliant. In fact Shannon gave such a good performance that even Loki himself may approve of his badassness as General Zod. The final fight is a spectacle to behold and the amount of destruction in this movie would make Roland Emmerich envious. Henry Cavill gave a good performance as Superman but I still felt as if he was too serious even when attempting humor. However I fell this could be the start of a great series for a comic book whose movie adaptations were not that impressive.  Now if Snyder can bring this kind of directing to all his movies he maybe the next big thing since Spielberg...."
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"Very good Action/Sci-fi film. Here are my only cons:

1. Should have done the story in chronological sequence instead of flashbacks.
2. No love relationship between Kal-El and Lois. Did not fit this film and could have waited for the sequel.

All in all, it was a good movie."
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,Epic! An expertly crafted hero origin story with superb performances by the entire cast. Henry Cavill and Michael Shannon were especially grand.
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,Pretty good movie obviously it didn't live up to the Mount Rushmore status it built itself up to but overall worth seeing needs to slow down a bit with the plot line
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,I give this movie 6 stars if I could this was unquestionably the best Superman movie ever made none of your silly corny villains but real honest to goodness grit and kept me on the edge of your seat the entire time a must see
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is an Excellent Superman movie!

I've read some of the negative reviews from some and I have to say I don't understand it?? Superman is a wonderful comic book character, who I have grown up watching since George Reeve played him on TV. 
I loved the cast of this new movie and I really liked how we got to see flashbacks in to events that helped shape Kal El into who he is. The storyline I think fits perfectly with how they have introduced our new superman. I really enjoyed the changes with Lois And Clark meeting... I can see the attraction and how they are there for each other. 
I also enjoyed the amount of action that was in this. It kept me tense for most of the movie but in a good way.
I also am a big fan of the tv show Smallville and felt like there were many shutouts to my favorite show. 
I'm really looking forward to another Superman movie that I was so excited to hear they are going to do!"
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"I am going to see it later afternoon mid-day Wounderful weather Today would see it
with my Dad he's think's about it?!!!!"
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"It's hard to put the entire childhood of superman and an action story into one film, but it was pulled of nicely, this seems like a great start to a new 3-4 film franchise."
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"I saw Man of Steel and liked it but I'm still stuck on the original story line. I imagine Krypton a place of beauty, this Krypton was ugly, and the idea that no babies were born naturally, but were ""grown"" like the Matrix, well if I didn't know better...but the actors especially Henry Cavill were really good, maybe the next  Superman will concentrate on people, not so much on spaceships and weapons of mass destruction. Don't we have enough violence, I like action, but this was a little too much."
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,I enjoyed this movie more than batman can't wait for justice league and the new batman
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,Two more days people wahoo wow 2h 23 minutes ok no soda before or during.  I thought it opened today one more week to go
"May 31, 2013",NEUTRAL,awesome movie. they explain the story very well especially in a origin story. they gave us a real superman movie.
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen I enjoyed every single part. This movie was action pack and was verry similar to the comics. great job!
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"The best by far Superman Origins film I have seen and the one I have waiting for somebody to make for the past 30 yrs. Cast is excellent Russell Crowe's role was a nice touch, and finally somebody got it right the most powerful Hero in the DC world actually looks it . You can see Nolan's finger prints all over this film. The action as well as visuals are fantastic. Leaves you looking forward to the sequel which is never a bad thing."
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"Finally, a real Superman movie.  I have been following the reviews and I do not understand the complaints. Strong characters and strong story, reminds me of the success of Batman Begins. I am already looking forward to the sequel."
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,a true superman story for a new generation
"May 31, 2013",NEUTRAL,Awesome but too many back stories for 1 movie.
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie rocked!  All the critics who have it a negative review evidently didn't watch the same movie!  I'm going back for seconds and possibly thirds and maybe fourths!  Go see it!
"May 31, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Better than Superman Returns, not a patch on Christopher Reeve. 

Possibly the worst script Christopher Nolan has been willing to put his name to, and certainly not in the same league as The Dark Knight or Avengers. 

Missed opportunity."
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,The critics don't know what the hell they're talking about. Man of Steel is the best movie of the summer hands down.
"May 31, 2013",NEUTRAL,"""MAN OF STEEL"" vacillates between action and angst excessively, but it succeeds as a sci-fi adventure, its core component.
***
Zack Snyder's not known for subtle qualities, so it shouldn't be surprising that ""MAN OF STEEL"" is so action-packed. But this flick is at risk of overdosing on the fight sequences at points (anyone want to a cost of destruction estimate?). Krypton's implosion? Perfectly timed and equally awesome. Metropolis under attack? Ostentatious and lengthy, though a nice bookend to the film's opening moments. I can't help but think this movie could've shed ten minutes of fat, being about a man of steel and all.

To balance out the long fight scenes, ""MAN OF STEEL"" does have key, quiet moments of introspection that are quite...alien. Literally and figuratively. It's all based in the morality and science of Jor-El. In fact, Warner Bros. has been marketing the film to Christians and it's hard to ignore the religious allegory here. Regardless of belief, the notion of blind faith and intuition ring strong in the moral arguments. It's a concept difficult to accept, as adolescent as it seems. Yet, on a meta level, that's exactly where the film takes place in the Superman universe. It's the defining move of the bigger game. This is typically the type of themes played out in prequels, not reboots.

But the story and shifting morals of society validate this reboot's existence, unlike, say, ""THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN"", which was made strictly for the cash. Henry Cavill is equally stoic and charismatic, but not a showoff (at least when it comes to acting). Michael Shannon should have stolen this film but played Zod almost too straightforward. Biggest standout was Amy Adams, who fit into the role of Lois Lane ideally. We relate to her because she's the most human, and Adams captured that human/nonhuman comparison perfectly in her acting.

Some of the dialogue was questionable and cliched. But given the alien - almost emoteless - nature of Krypton, it can be excused at parts. And as lengthy as the final action sequence was (not to mention some totally unrealistic, unconcerned reactions of civilians), it definitely was cool to look at. Same goes for the dangerous, anxious atmosphere that hangs over the film, nicely highlighted by the 'baggage' Clark holds onto (told via flashbacks, nicely interwoven into the tale). It's flawed, sure, but it gets the job done. A new direction for Superman, a complex character who just got...even more multifaceted."
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie is going to be amazing! Ignore any bad reviews and see it for yourself!!!  It will not disappoint!
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"A Kick ass superman! It is a bit too dark and somewhat gloomy but for some of the critics and few other naysayers, I don't think they are or ever will be ready for a true Superman movie like we just got. The movie is both stunning action and plot heavy, dealing with complex spiritual issues as well as what it means to be human. 
Looking forward to the sequel."
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie. Very good
"May 31, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Nesympaticki herci, nezazivne vystavany pribeh, efekty boli OK, ale to je asi tak vsetko. Hollywood nie a nie dat Supermanovi konecne pokoj"
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"Finally a good Superman movie! I really enjoyed the nonlinear story telling, which negated the inevitable boring parts of an origin story, and the internal struggle that revealed Superman's emotional ineptitude without drawing too much attention to it. And the action was, of course, brilliant and over the top as it should be. It's Superman: he's not a thinker, he's a puncher. If you don't expect the character to be Batman, you'll thoroughly enjoy this flick. Zach Snyder has done (for me) the impossible and created a Superman movie I want to watch again."
"May 31, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I'm all for superman. And Henry Cavill looked absolutely divine in those spanks, but there was so much back story that it kind of got boring. I found myself almost falling asleep a few times. Hopefully the next one will be better."
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,this movie rocks...period! !
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,Very good reeboot to a franchise that sorely needed it. It really REALLY makes superman feel more human and relatable than ever before.the opening sequence is great but the flashbacks to his past seem jumbled together and rushed but that is a minor nitpick to an otherwise great adaptation of a comic book legend. Not better than the dark knight but the action is second to none and will make all other comic book movies step there game up. I highly recommend man of steel!
"May 31, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Flat characters, a disjointed narrative, boring action sequences and a heavy handed but still shallow approach to the film's themes make for one of the worst Superman movies yet."
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie so far.
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"Best movie I've seen by far. It's literally the most intense, the most incredible, and easily hands down, the most insane superhero movie I've ever seen. Superman is back with a bang. Definitely the best movie of 2013."
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,Superman is the man. Great movie with Great action and amazing enemy. Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan took Superman to a totally new level and were able to break the superman movie curse. Great stuff and waiting for another one.
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie looks so cool
"May 31, 2013",NEGATIVE,Disappointed and very long slow and boring!
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,Better than the original.
"May 31, 2013",NEUTRAL,Not great but still a good movie. You get what you paid for which is a good time
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"Following Zack Snyder tradition, this movie was beautiful. Particularly the scenes of Clark Kent growing up on a farm. You could certainly pick this movie's script and storyline apart, but if you sit back, relax, and just enjoy it, you will be thoroughly entertained."
"May 31, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Way to long, doesn't develop characters I can have an interest in. I'm sorry DC, your just not Marvel."
"May 31, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The movie leaves you with a unsatisfied cheap feeling. They lost the uniqueness of Superman as a big screen superhero. Too much CGI - we get it - you can make a building realistically blowup, crumble, fall, etc. For awhile I thought I was watching Gladiator meets Inception. And really was that the best idea they could come up with as an ending?!? The old Superman Zod battle and ending was technically more entertaining and ingenious. Hope they try again, but they need a fresh approach, and please add some humor."
"May 31, 2013",NEGATIVE,Its too Rigid and cliched. Full review can be found at http://mallocs-of-life.blogspot.in/2013/06/movie-review-man-of-steel-too-rigid-and.html a big thumbs down.
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel soars in part to great performances, beautiful visual style and cinematography, and a more mature direction by Zack Snyder than we have seen yet."
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,a massive improvement on last superman. although a little too reliant on special fx and fight scenes.
"May 31, 2013",POSITIVE,great action but the story was sketchy it was too.one sided superman was never in.any real danger neither were the people on earth
"May 31, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This movie nearly had me to tears many times throughout. Unfortunately, it also had me looking at the time and dazing off too many times. Luckily, the emotional scenes and strong themes this movie had out weighed the very self indulgent action scenes."
"May 30, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie was awesome. it had everything. great acting, story, action and effects."
"May 30, 2013",POSITIVE,Extraordinary movie the only ones that matter are the normal people. critics suck
"May 30, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great reboot of the franchise, hard to see anyone else playing Superman after watching this film."
"May 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Man of Steel shows tremendous potential throughout but squanders its dramatic promise on action that spills from one kinetic act to the next, sometimes with barely a breath between beatdowns. It's all thrilling stuff; visually it's as rousing as Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, not to mention one of the more effective realizations of what it might look like if superpowered beings went toe to toe on Earth. The Kryptonians' speed alone is a sight to behold. But these rather empty thrills lack the impact of more refined superhero adaptations."
"May 30, 2013",POSITIVE,Best superman in many decades. This is very very awesome creation from zach snyder.
"May 30, 2013",NEGATIVE,Loved the movie hated the lead girl
"May 30, 2013",POSITIVE,A must see truly epic and awesome the Superman movie for us the fans the hell with the critics go see the movie!!  :-)
"May 30, 2013",NEGATIVE,"While mildly entertaining, the film is tonally inconsistent and gets bogged down in the third act by its own grandiosity."
"May 30, 2013",NEGATIVE,Too long and superman wasn't a good actor
"May 30, 2013",NEGATIVE,the first was horrible don't expect alot from this one
"May 30, 2013",NEGATIVE,Not very interesting.
"May 30, 2013",NEGATIVE,Totally different superman movie.   was a cross between watching a star wars comes to earth  type movie
"May 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Tries hard to be grander and grander and grander, and forgets to be enjoyable."
"May 30, 2013",POSITIVE,great cast trailers look good crossing fingers
"May 30, 2013",POSITIVE,This is just automatic for me
"May 30, 2013",POSITIVE,Definitely done it's justice!
"May 30, 2013",POSITIVE,"I liked it, not bad at all!"
"May 30, 2013",POSITIVE,Extremely well done. It wasn't the conventional way of doing a super hero origins move and with all of the recent ones done it very refreshing. Henry Cavill did an excellent job as the Man of Steel. Must see and I will again.
"May 30, 2013",POSITIVE,Great update for superman. One of those super summer movies
"May 30, 2013",POSITIVE,"""A-Freakin'-MAZING"" Finally someone has  done the story justice. This will be the superman of our generation. I just got paid and yoy know where you can find me for the weekend. watching Man of Steel over and over."
"May 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,This Superman definitely saved the day...
"May 30, 2013",POSITIVE,Such an emotional critical movie that I believe that deserves respect for being a good reboot unlike superman returns
"May 21, 2013",POSITIVE,Better than I had hoped I loved it.
"May 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is not the superman as you know before, its quite dark side of Clark Kent and the plot before he gets to the Daily Planet."
"May 21, 2013",POSITIVE,A great superhero movie and definitely the best superman movie there is. It had all the right pieces to make it a slick sci-fi movie and a interesting origin story.
"May 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,"My favorite thing about this movie was Russell Crowe's performance as Jor El, I really hope he's around in some form in any potential sequels. My only real problem was with the the Superpeople fighting scenes, save the last one. (Old Superman cartoon action scenes were more interesting) Though Mr. Kent's revised death was also a huge eye roller.

EDIT: I've grown increasingly displeased with how this movie ended. Seriously uncharacteristic portrayal of Superman."
"May 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Brief movie review number one: Man of Steel. It was pretty good. Wonderful special effects, excellent villains. Loved the relationship between Kal-El and both of his fathers, and that with his mother. Loved the supersonic effect when he flew. Found the messianic overtones interesting. Would've liked more character development and less brooding Dark Knightification of Superman. Would've liked more reason to empathize with Perry White and the staff. Hated the romance between he and Lois Lane; McCain and Palin had more chemistry. I expected great and I got good, so I'm not too disappointed. I put the film behind The Dark Knight Trilogy, The Avengers, Iron Man, and Spider-Man 2. I put it even with X-2 and X-Men First Class, and slightly ahead of Thor and Spider-Man. I give it a good B- or B."
"May 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"Finally, a superman movie to be proud of."
"May 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,better than iron man 3
"May 21, 2013",POSITIVE,A superman for the new generation. Snyder has truly given the fans something to be proud of.
"May 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,Good movie. BUT could have used less action sequences.  There were too many breaks between. All the actors were good fits for the movie. I would definitely see a sequel. Needed more funny moments.
"May 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great but I am a Smallville fan, so not terrific"
"May 20, 2013",POSITIVE,I thought it was great.  Four stars for my overall enjoyment. Decent story.  Great action and oh my Henry Cavill!! The villain is awesome. But other characters and dialog drags a bit.
"May 20, 2013",POSITIVE,"I was a little nervous about this film as I've never been a huge fan of any Superman movies (especially the most recent Superman Returns), but the involvement of Christopher Nolan made me a little more confident that this film would be good.  I liked how the film was shot and even though the number of flashbacks is a tough way to tell a superhero origin story, it works for the most part and feels similar to Batman Begins.  The acting is top notch and is really solid all around.  The special effects are very good and the action scenes are good, even though they kind of feel like The Matrix at times and gets a little over the top at the end.  Overall a very solid superhero film and a huge improvement over the last attempt at restarting the Superman saga."
"May 20, 2013",POSITIVE,pretty good superman origin story and awesome fight scenes. B-
"May 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,One of the best superhero movies of all time.
"May 20, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman Movie made. This one blows the rest out of the water. Action nonstop and even a final battle you didn't see comin
"May 20, 2013",POSITIVE,"Critics! t-.-t. This was awesome! Great watch, Cavill and Adams nailed it."
"May 20, 2013",POSITIVE,best superman movie ever
"May 20, 2013",POSITIVE,Not only was it outstanding but it was also breath taking.
"May 20, 2013",POSITIVE,Blows away the last Superman movie. Sweet flick. Makes me feel 'MURICAN!
"May 20, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel - best sci fi blockbuster action movie I've seen in 10 years. 3D and sfx better than Avatar. Action and story better than Avengers, epic scale action movie that delivers every minute. It's what I wished The Matrix 2 and 3 were."
"May 20, 2013",NEGATIVE,Way to long and pointless fight scenes were endless. Action without emotion is boring and this movie was boring and disappointing. Was really hoping for more.
"May 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It's back with all of the spectical and great action scenes, but the story gets lost in all of the spectical. I give this solid movie a B rating."
"May 20, 2013",POSITIVE,Incredible!  Visually appealing and solid story.  You really need to see this in theatres to get the full effect!  I've stopped looking at what critics think about movies as I can't remember the last time I agreed with them.
"May 20, 2013",POSITIVE,best summer movie.  best special effects i've ever seen
"May 20, 2013",NEGATIVE,"√¢~...√¢~...√¢~...√¢~Spoiler Alert√¢~√¢~...√¢~...√¢~...
I hated the fact that superman killed"
"May 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Visually spectacular, but emotionally distant. The effects are bombastic and the action a little too unrelenting. The pacing felt chaotic and needed to focus more screen time on character development."
"May 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A more grown up superman movie that removes the campy 80's style, into a darker movie that is a little more realistic, or as realistic as a man that flies round in a cape can be. It cuts out that Lois and Clark along with the Lex and superman relationship crap that is force fed to us in the other movies, even though it feels a little empty not see hide nor hair of our bald villain in this movie. Not a bad remake of Superman II, yes I said it a remake, watch the old Superman II and watch the Man of Steel, quite similar.
You be the judge."
"May 20, 2013",NEGATIVE,It just wasn't entertaining to me.
"May 20, 2013",POSITIVE,It does lack the traditional love story and connection that nearly all the superman movies had but the best one made by far they made him a superman for sure and a reasonable explanation why but also made him vulnerable much like the newer Batman movies if they made the connection with Lois would Have given it a 5
"May 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Theatrical Masterpiece definitely the most visually stunning renditions of the Superman Franchise to date and a overall an solid acting performance as well especially from Russel Crowe. Not to be taken out of context though, its deficiencies (quality story telling and sequenced presentation) are in some ways compensated by the over the top dramatics"
"May 20, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great new take on the man of steel, just a fun movie to go see!"
"May 20, 2013",POSITIVE,Not as good as the dark knight films but still a great new adaption on the man of steel with impressive action
"May 20, 2013",POSITIVE,this movie was amazing. couldn't of been happier with how well things were explained and the amount of action that took place
"May 20, 2013",POSITIVE,"It is awesome,  it's definitely not your daddy's superman. Action is off the charts.  Story holds up,  love the way the origin of his coming to earth was told and the way he grew up.  It is set in todays world, with real decision making."
"May 20, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman I've seen! going ta see it again
"May 20, 2013",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed this movie. Take the story line from first two Christopher Reeves Superman movies, shake it up with some darkness from the Chronicles of Riddick. Subtract the 70s humour and you have a Super movie far better than previous renditions."
"May 20, 2013",POSITIVE,cant wait to see this movies.... screw the other critics.. there just getting paid by Disney to say that....
"May 20, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie was excellent as I anticipated. The story was a tad dry near the end, but it played the character of Superman very well."
"May 20, 2013",POSITIVE,best superman EVER!!!!!!!!!!!
"May 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Although standard, it delivers the true essence of the Superhero Movie genre. It's a sincere and heartwarming tale of a hero derived from deeper and meaningful yearnings, the kind that would make you want to hate Iron Man and his irritable narcissism."
"May 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I expected it to be much better, but its not a bad movie at all. Supermans backstory just felt alittle.....rushed. I hope the sequal (rumored to be in production) delivers as well as the Dark knight
 did to the batman trilogy."
"May 20, 2013",NEGATIVE,Best Superman movie to date. Distinctly average high budget cgi action flick stuffed with plot holes.
"May 20, 2013",POSITIVE,finally superman has a great movie
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,An Origin Story combined with a Finding my plave in the World Tale. Action abound on Krypton and Earth. This is THE Superman fans have been waiting for! Nuff said!
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,"I liked it a lot more than I thought I would... While along the same vein as the original story, it was totally different - in a good way!!  Definitely worth checking out!!"
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,Best movie I have honestly seen! Amazing visual effects! New and exciting things about Krypton!
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,Superb cast. Special effects were phenomenal. Great movie for any action or comics fan
"May 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This was a much more different approach on the Superman franchise.  It wasn't bad, however I did spot just a few errors that they should of fixed; they went back and forth with past and present of Clark and the main one was that Lois Lane called him Clark when he was Superman which made the ending scene awkward.  However, the SFX really helped out with the fight scenes which makes you see just how far we have come from the Christopher Reeve movies.  Overall, not bad but should have been made a little more different."
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,man of steel is bad ass
"May 19, 2013",NEGATIVE,Way too long. Just because they shot lots of good footage doesn't mean that it all had to be used in the final movie.
"May 19, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Way off of the original storyline in a terrible way. There is a huge lack of character development and jumping in too quick into action and fx scenes. Lois and Clark suddenly kissed without obvious chemistry development. I don't know who to blame: the writer, the producer, the director, or the editor. Knowing it's Zack Snyder, that's probably why.. This movie could have been better. Cavill was a good Superman, although Amy Adams is too plain. My point is, this movie only offers violence and special effects that gets really boring."
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,"Entertaining, gripping, and mesmerizing, and room for more."
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great back story and character development, fantastic imagery.  Ending seemed a bit too easy however."
"May 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,It was really good but a little confusing as they jumped from present to past and back
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,better than I thought!
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,Always a great story. Excellent FX. Excellent cast. The only thing that was troublesome is tha5 the camera was shaky. I've noticed that a lot in the 3D movies. Excellent otherwise.
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,They brought back the movie in a new entire way that was amazing. Superman was reimagined with taste and the action was enough to make you want to see more Superman. The CGI was awesome and the score added to the depth of the story. It had good laughs at its right moments. I loved this movie and want to see it again.
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,Better than I thought. Liked how Clark is lost and doesn't know how to handle balancing his powers and life.
"May 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,5 stars until the ridiculous battle with Zod
"May 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,Man of Steel? More like Zod of Steel featuring Jor El and that time Superman showed up for 20 minutes.
"May 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,"More of a sci-fi, which turned out good in a way. 
Too, too dramatic!"
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,It was definitely worth watching!!!
"May 19, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Even the action doesn't make up for the poor story, random edits, irrational decisions, and bland dialogue.  I couldn't resonate at all with this movie. √∞~"""
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,"To the critics who gave MoS a low rating, I say this.  You have no love and joy in your hearts.  Any childlike simple happiness died in you, and you have forgotten why we go and see Summer blockbuster movies.  You need to go play in a park for awhile, and play with Legos or something because something died in you, and you should probably try to revive it.
I loved Man of Steel!  Snyder put on screen what went on in my childhood imagination as I read Superman comics!  Loads of fun.  My wife swooned when she saw Henry Cavill in the suit.  I'm fine with it.  What ya gonna do, right?  He's Superman."
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,"Despite Goyer's occasionally overwritten dialogue that detracts a little of the humanity, 'Man of Steel' works thanks to some inventive and artistically-minded direction that lends both realism yet also a fantastical quality from the much maligned Snyder. Add in also an adrenaline-charged soundtrack by Hans Zimmer that serves more as underscore than standout like John Williams' famous music. Further, top notch effects and a powerhouse cast, Costner and Crowe especially delivering some of their best performances in a while, and Man of Steel is a quality summer picture."
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,omg... this was the best Superman movie since Christopher Reeves donned the cape... I loved it so much.. it was great..  it was great.. its got to be seen..  it put an awesome twist on an awesome superhero. .
"May 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This film was killed in three words: Heavy Back Story. The first 20 minutes of the film take place on Superman's home world of Krypton and focus on his father Jor-El. Though it was interesting, for a film about Superman they spent way more time developing his father instead. From there the film spends another 15 or so minutes covering Clarke's time on Earth, all of which wasn't even essential to the plot. The entire 40 or 50 minutes spent on his back story really could've been summed up in about 20 or 30 minutes which would've given the film more time to develop characters like Superman or Lois Lane. Neither of the film's core characters displayed any real emotion or had any deep goals or desires to make the audience care, which is where it fails. However, I do have to say that this is a solid piece. Man of Steel isn't the worst Superman film and far from the best either but it is the most exciting. The visuals are amazing and even though the characters aren't very interesting, it is still enjoyable to watch. Man of Steel gets 3.5 out of 5 stars from me. Its worth the watch but you won't likely be falling in love with it."
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,Was the best superman movie ever!!!!!!!!
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,amazing fight scenes & special effects..can't waiting for the sequel...best superman I ever seen!!(;
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!
"May 19, 2013",NEGATIVE,"great vfx, great sfx, but i didn't like the story"
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,awesome cant wait for the next one.
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman Movie Since Superman II
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,Non stop action !!!!
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,Wow! Loved this interpretation of Superman! Very good! Dark but great story. Adapted well with reality type of comic book movie!
"May 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Good intro. But the pacing is a bit off and it was a little too drenched in action at the end.  Still, I'd recommend it for even a casual movie goer as its good moments care excellent. √∞'?"
"May 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,better than the typical cornball superman.
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,The greatest Version of Superman to date! Great story and awesome effects! The opening on Krypton were awesome! Go see it!!!!
"May 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I found it was tooooooooo long. I don't know why directors continue to focus on the beginning of the superheroes movies, it is what it is, so pleaseeee let it rest. Continue the last one, when he had a son, something newwwwww Also, don't like Louise."
"May 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,Hmmm... Great beginning then they had to screw it up! The last 30 mins was a pain in my ears!
"May 19, 2013",NEGATIVE,Very slow!  Too much back story!
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome. Louis Lang not pretty like another movie
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,"Wasn't as good as id thought itd be,
But still worth a watch.."
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,Absolutely Amazing....Henry Cavill was absolutely fantastic as Superman and Shannon did an amazing job in bringing life to the General Zod....All the supporting cast was good with Kevin Costner And Russel Crowe doing exceptionally good...The special effects were charming and the action sequences were quite amazing...This is the BEST Superman Movie till date!
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,Goes back to the original idea from the creators of superman. Appreciate the Christian symbolism.
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,Excellent storyline and action.
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,"I have alot of mixed feelings about this motion picture. It didn`t quite live up to my expectations, they were high to say the least but realistic judging by the trailers. The trailers blew not only me but everyone out of the water with it`s realistic and dramatic tone. Finally we would get the tear dropping action-packed epic we had dreamt of since Superman Returns. While we got a great movie, we did not get the epic we saw from the trailer. The script is just too unbalanced with the pace going wild one hour in. We want a consistent break between action sequences that fills us in on how things are going and let`s us see how the characters react to what they`re experiencing. Yes, we do see it occasionally but it`s not enough, it`s too short and way too far between each time. All the action is squeezed into an hour of destruction half way through the movie. Don`t get me wrong the action was spectacular with breathtaking effects and some impressive camera work, but it`s all one sequence after the other. I would have liked if they got a nice blend between that and breaks which moves the story along so that mabye the flashbacks could occur while Superman was at his lowest. The flashbacks are simply stunning. Composer Hans Zimmer has become one of the go-to musical geniouses for high budget movies. He always delivers but I would say this is his best work so far. Even topping Inception`s soundtrack. All the actors delivered nice performances but the script as mentioned wasn`t that good. When Zack Snyder hits the nail on it`s head he really nails it. The emotional conversations, how Clark struggles to fit in with society, the relationship he has with his parents, the important choices he has to make. All the focus is where it needs to be. So as I have said if they made a director`s cut and also shorten down some action sequences then this can easily get 4.5/5 but as it stands now, it`s a 4/5."
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,"As a Superman fan, 'Man of Steel' had me entertained and excited throughout. Great visuals and story telling with amazing action sequences."
"May 19, 2013",POSITIVE,"I'm tired of people comparing this to the Christopher reeves version. Nostalgia aside, those movies are not great. Superman rewinds the earth....rewinds the earth. For the first time I really care about the superman character. He is conflicted in this movie because let's face it, humans are scumbags.
It loses one star because holy smokes did they go overboard on the metropolis destruction at the end. In a post 9/11 world, we can say that people lived that horror not that long ago. I think they needed to tone it down."
"May 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is perfect. Seriously, the action in this is mind blowing. I feel audiences are convinced every superhero film has to be light hearted and up beat through out because of what Marvel did with Iron Man 3 and The Avengers. Frankly, this film is better than those."
"May 18, 2013",NEGATIVE,"crap in a box with an ""S"" on top. don't worry about my opinion, because you'll pay money to see the same story redone anyhow. :-)"
"May 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,Well a movie I been waiting since last year when I saw preview did not disappoint!It was great to see one of my all time favorite superheros back!!I kind of felt the whole Krypton backstory was to long.But when it came to overall story line I felt it kind of fell short..I just felt it was missing something. but either way it was good..lots of action..all characters play there roles great.It was good to see all the kids once again get excited for SUPERMAN!Now to wait for part 2 and whole will be the new villain? can we say Lex  Luther!
"May 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"I thought the story was very nicely and artfully handled, the acting was great (not cheesy) and that both Henry Cavill and Michael Shannon were superbly cast. DC has just provided the necessary spark for a full fledged DC universe on celluloid. God willing we will finally see a better Green Lantern movie, or maybe even a Flash or Wonder Woman vehicle. If the comic/movie gods are really benevolent maybe even some JLA action. Great film and finally a Superman that looks the part."
"May 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The beginning of the film is great sci-fi, and I would happily watch an entire film or series like this on the death of Krypton. Russell Crowe is great as Jor-el, and the design of the kryptonian world is cohesive and spectacularly science-fictiony. 
 As the film moves to Clark's formative years, it's interesting to see the ways in which someone with his abilities and secrets could have realistically grown up as an outsider. The issue of acceptance remains part of Clark's character arc throughout the movie. This is actually part of the film's troubling characterization of Superman. The movie gives Clark little reason to love humanity. Additionally, humanity has not just been presented with no reason to yet adore Superman when the aliens come calling for him, but has not even been introduced to his existence. There's no compelling reason in the world of this film for Superman to make sacrifices for humanity, or for them to defend him, and no feelings of pathos can come from such a nonexistent relationship. Henry Cavill is a good-looking Superman but an unconvincing Clark Kent. Either the performance or the writing have made him more distant, and less warm. Amy Adams however is enjoyable as Lois Lane. Man of Steel remains at least a decent film until the end, when it devolves into an orgy of excessive destruction. The film in general has a harsher feel than previous Supermans, with more violence and less warmth."
"May 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,The movie and the story line were great. The action sequences were beyond amazing. A few things though the movie runs a tad long and the scenes jump. If you have three hours to show a movie than show all of the damn movie. Don't edit important scenes out!!! Above all (spoiler alert) why did Louise Lane know everything about Superman/ Clark Kent before he even went to work at the Daily News and for some strange reason she was the only person who knew were he was at all times. Come on now. That backwards from the story we all know and love.
"May 18, 2013",NEGATIVE,Now I am going to get on DVD it was a cool movie
"May 18, 2013",POSITIVE,If you go see it expecting something like the Dark Knight then u will be disappionted. If you go it looking for great action and exscapism then this for ya
"May 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Very entertaining.  I loved it!!
"May 18, 2013",NEGATIVE,"""This man of steel is overstuffed""
Movie Review: Man of Steel
Date Viewed: June 21 2013
Directed By Zack Snyder (300 and Watchmen)
Screenplay By David S. Goyer, Story By Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer, based on ""Superman"" created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.
Starring: Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Kevin Costner, Laurence Fishburne, Russell Crowe, Antje Traue, Ayelet Zurer, Harry Lennix, Christopher Meloni, and Richard Schiff.

The new Superman movie ""Man of Steel"" is a joyless spectacle with action sequences that seem to last forever and we get to see the origins story once again. However, British actor Henry Cavill gives a good performance as the man of steel.

""Man of Steel"" is maybe a great movie to look at, but it has it's flaws. Unlike the original 1978 ""Superman"" starring the late Christopher Reeve, there is no humor or senses of awe to be found and the villains I thought where pretty weak. I like Michael Shannon a lot but he doesn't create a strong villain here as General Zod. 

I giving ""Man of Steel"" a mixed review only because not only is Cavill really good. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are really good as Clark's parents and Amy Adams is a good upgrade from Kate Bosworth (from ""Superman Returns"") as Lois Lane. 

I expected more from ""Man of Steel"", but it's the most overstuffed movie of the summer with fight scenes that fall into the vein of Michael Bay and it has too much plot.

Director Zack Snyder (300 and Watchmen) wants to make ""Man of Steel"" on the same level as ""Batman Begins"", but it's not on the same level as Christopher Nolan's ""Batman"" trliogy or even ""Iron Man"".

I was disappointed, but maybe with the next film. They'll probably get it right."
"May 18, 2013",POSITIVE,A great rehash of Superman. All the best features of the films and Smallville taken in to account to make a top quality Superman film with a good amount of focus on Krypton
"May 5, 2013",POSITIVE,"Excellent new take on my favourite Superhero! Dark, mysterious, often sad, relevant and most of all gut wrenchingly human. Man of steel is back with new power costume, less candy floss &  overall subdued palette inline with the Dark Knight.  The action sequences are top notch, the flying simply breath taking. At last Superman comes of age."
"May 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I don't know much about the comics out original story, but this is basically how I'd envision Superman in the real world."
"May 5, 2013",NEGATIVE,Arguably the worst Superman movie to date. I am shocked and outraged at what that hack Zack Snyder did to this franchise. I despise Michael Bay but I honestly feel like even he would have done a better job than this. Superman Returns is better and thats saying a whole hell of a lot.
"May 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,three weeks later and I can't remember it. but it was fun.
"May 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,Kind of the same thing over and over again
"May 5, 2013",POSITIVE,"not what I expected, but better! def an awesome movie!!"
"May 5, 2013",POSITIVE,amazing movie. it is what fans have been waiting for!
"May 5, 2013",POSITIVE,The best film I have seen this year. I cannot wait for more to come.
"May 5, 2013",POSITIVE,"You are all retarded, this movie rocks."
"May 5, 2013",NEGATIVE,Simply long and boring.
"May 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,A very long movie........zzzzz
"May 5, 2013",POSITIVE,"Creo que es una cinta bastante Epica y espectacular, justo como debe ser un buen blockbuster sin caer en algo como transformers. Una vez mas se demuestra que los criticos son basura."
"May 5, 2013",POSITIVE,"Such an amazing film. Snyder, Goyer and Nolan made the Man of Tomorrow for todays world. Epic action, great story and amazing visuals. Henry Cavill was awesome as Superman."
"May 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I thought this movie was good and entertaining. However I felt that it was not Christopher Nolan's best movie and that it moved slowly.  I did however give him credit for making the movie because superman movies are difficult. This is because superman is so indestructible. Overall, I rated it a 3 1/2 for beginning the story well. The director did a good job leading up to superman discovering who he is and why he is on earth. In the end I would recommend this movie."
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Omg Best S Superman movie ever in my life!!! Out of all the Superman movies I've ever seen ever this is the for bestest 1 that hands down is soon as it has a pre order to buy it on Blu ray I'm getting it. I suggest if you haven't seen it you go and see it otherwise you're going to miss out on the biggest movie of the summer.
"May 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This was not the movie Superman deserved. This was some Barnacle Boy type business. Took over an hour to unfold the plot, Superman had like 3 lines. It was good, but a huge miss since I was expecting so much."
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,it was different. went a different direction with the story. good special effects and and story.
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Masterpiece. Don't listen to the critics
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,you have to  c this movie so much better than the others :)
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,If i could put more stars i would :)
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,this is my fav movie of the year!
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"If you have been waiting for the epic answer to the hidden secrets of Superman, this is the film. Forget the critics, this movie has the stamp of Nolan and Snyder, which is quality and a great storyline. Highly recomended."
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,What can I say? SEQUEL!!! This was action packed from pretty much beginning to end.  One thing didn't like but can't say without spoiler at the end.  You'll know it when you see it.
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie was intense with great action sequences and outstanding special effects. Henry Cavill was the perfect actor to play superman and that shows in the movie. Though some scenes jump through time, all in all, the scenes and order of each event makes sense. The new costume for Clark is amazingly detailed and and fun the watch the cape flow around. Zack Snyder did an excellent job with blockbuster and I wish to buy on DVD later to watch this many times. This summer blockbuster makes you emotional and excited and leaves you with a grin on your face."
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Critics be damned. This was a good movie!
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,very good...nice backstory build up...great action scenes
"May 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I went in doubtful, and I was right...this movie was TOO dark-do they have to turn everything into The Dark Knight? Superman's suit was dull and drab.
And the constant throbbing of Hans Zimmers score was nearly enough to make me leave the theatre. I can't fault the actors-but I can fault Chris Nolan for ruining this and trying to turn it into something it's not--Batman."
"May 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The movie is okay at best not great, it doesn't come close to the 1978 Christopher Reeve superman but still worth the watch..."
"May 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I haven't seen the older Superman, but this one needs some sort of improvement. I'm conflicted on my thoughts. It was a decent plot but the ending battle was disappointing in my opinion. There was a lot of bombs and action though."
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"It started slow, but ended up being a good movie. Enjoyed the long action scene..."
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great Movies and great remake!! Visual effects are on par with our times, and the expansion of the story of Krypton, and origin of Superman was amazing. Lessons on courage, sacrifice, choices are always tied to the Superman life, and were brought out perfectly in the movie. The acting was simple and needed to be...Superman story lives in every human heart."
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Pretty entertaining. I may be partial still to the
late great Christopher Reeve but this was a good and different take on the
superman franchise. Man of Steel packs quite the punch."
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Extremely fast paced origin story. Great ending. Would have said 5 stars, but found myself having a hard time keeping up with the story at times. Second time through I was able to keep up. As a Superman fan I was trying to absorb too much on the first viewing. :) Great flick. Almost perfect."
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome movie !!! Would watch it many more other times
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,This is the best Superman movie ever made.
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Let's face it, Superman (and about 90% of the superheroes in comics) are hard to portray in a film? why? because in this day and age, bogged down by the realities of our day to day lives, we like to escape to the movies. And yet, at the same time, we dont want to see something ridiculously out there, i.e. a rocket wielding raccoon that talks. or a CGI Ryan Reynolds. Thats why, despite the success of recent Marvel fare, Warner Bros. and DC (and I suppose, to a lesser extent, most other film studios) has kept from making films with unbelievable plots. But I am hedre to tell you NOBODY CARES. Man of Steel is a fantastic revisioning of Superman's origin story without batting an eye to other superheroes or even its own predecessors. Honest, I could have never heard of Superman before, and i would have enjoyed every second of the film just the same. I recommend seeing this one in theaters for the action scenes alone (no 3D, please.) and please please please dont stay til the end of the credits. Theres nothing there, I promise. Just another reason DC may be on its way to heavily competing with Marvel. Next up, Wonder Woman."
"May 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I think the biggest flaw is the character development.  The film based to slow down, build relationships and feeling...How did Lois and Clark get so attached?  Why should the audience worry about the nameless employees from the daily planet caught in the rubble?"
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"I have to say, after reading some of the awful comments on this film, I felt I needed to add my own two cents in as well... This was, in my opinion, the best superman movie ever as well as the best superhero movie to date! The plot was well thought out. I felt the movie could've gone longer because I was glued to my seat and didn't know how long I had been sitting there.  I really hope there are many sequels to this one because this was excellent!"
"May 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Eh. Decent action and SFX. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't as good as I hoped. Maybe the superhero-revisited theme is getting old..."
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Hans Zimmer's music narrowly beats Henry Cavill's performance to the punch as the ultimate highlight of this brilliant movie
"May 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I really, really, really wanted to like this movie more than I did. I wanted it to be as powerful and epic as the first film of Nolan's trilogy (Batman Begins), but it just didn't live up to my expectations. It was enjoyable, but at the same time was forgettable"
"May 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,great story line but seems like they were trying to cram so much back story into the movie started to forget the movie is about superman. overall good and I'm sure a sequel will be out soon and I'll be there
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Loved it! outstanding movie and a great start to what could be an awesome set of DC movies!
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Love this film,a good start to a franchise :)"
"May 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The ironny with ""Man of Steel"" is that it is more iron than steel; strong in premise but brittle in execution."
"May 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It was a pretty good movie, but Marvel still comes out as victor.  It is an enjoyable film and has a great story, but I feel they could have done more with the characters especially the villains."
"May 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,I went to see this movie the past week..From a purely entertainment stand point I found it very good.. It could have done with less violence.  I found the fight scenes a little drawn out for my taste and kind of pointless since both opponets were played as indestructable. Overall I found that this is worth seeing on the big screen.
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel Was GREAT. A lot going on, time flew by considering the running time. This is NOT your Dad's Superman! Great re-envisioning. A LOT of action and great visuals. Cast well, and can't wait for the follow up films. Whatever you think you know about Superman films of the past and how he acts/reacts, leave it at the door. This is Square One. Enjoy."
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,I absolutely loved this movie. I never really cared for the original superman movies because he was too much of boyscout. This movie sucked you in with its dark storyline. And Michael Shannon as Zod was pure genius.
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"I really liked this movie.  It's vastly superior to the god awful ""Superman Returns"". There is heart and soul in this film and it manages to stay grounded. The action can be chaotic at times. While superman tries to save metropolis,  he manages to nearly devastate the ciry in order to accomplish his task. But I like this darker tone and hope Zack Synder returns for the next installment."
"May 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Ok where do I begin...well I guess Ill start with the movie was just barely ok. It was really long and boring, the action scenes were shot terribly and the editing was confusing. Now even with all that the movie is still watchable but only by the casts sheer force of will. For the most part the actors do a fine job and the story is a decent intro to the superman character(I don't know how accurate it is to cannon but it set him up), it is just the technical aspects that fail the actors. I like Zach Snyder so I don't think this was all him but I don't know what the hell happened. This movie didn't piss me off like Iron Man 3 but it was way more boring. If you are a huge comic fan see it otherwise wait till dvd."
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is the best Superman movie ever made.
It has a great story. Great, multi- dimensional characters. It has the most human like characters ever revealed in a super hero movie. It has fantastic action. It has phenomenal special effects. I highly recommend it!"
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,it was a great movie it really had a great plot. this is one of zack Snyder's better movies
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,I'm not sure what movie the critics saw...but this movie is BADA$$!!!!!!!!  That's it.
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"It was different how they explained Superman's back story,  splicing flashbacks in between scenes.  Sometimes it was felt a little weird, but most of the time it fit.  It was definitely a movie worthy of Superman."
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,This is the best the superman movies out of all movies. 2 thumbs up 5 stars can't wait for the next
"May 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,Too much CGI not enough filler!
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"man of steel is not only visually fantastic, but also having great performances and incredible action. I would like to watch it more than once."
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Action packed. Enough said. Great setup for more character development in the sequel.
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"I am a Big Superman fan, but this was not what I expected it to be. it started slow and a little boring. Overall it was a OK movie."
"May 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,Could have been a great movie. The last part of the movie is excessive.
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,Finally a very good Superman movie. Best superhero movie since Avengers & Dark Knight Rises.
"May 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Like most Zach Snider movies this is a choppy series of music videos. The performances are wooden, the story is thin, the action is non-stop to the point of being overbearing and the score is monotonous. After Superman Returns turned out to be a retread, I was looking forward to a new version.  I just didn't expect a dour, humorless, neck-snapping version to be ""this generation's Superman""."
"May 4, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Enjoyed the first half with a look at the human side of Kal El or Clark, 2nd half might have been a little overdone as far as special effects and the destruction of Metropolis.  Overall decent, they have some room for improvement and a good template to work with."
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Zach Snyder will make ""Man of Steel"" like ""300"" on steroids. I remember seeing Chistopher Reeves in the 1st adaptation when I was younger and the feelings I had were happy then sad, angry then glad. Now that I'm older I can almost feel those same emotions coming back to me in a reminicent state with this one and welcome it! -clc"
"May 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Kind of a let down. This movie could have been better if the charecters were more devoloped. The relationship between father and son should have been explored further. Especially when you have Costner and Crowe playing Kent and Jor El. It seems that the focus was on special effects, which by the way were nothing spectacular. One of the best things Snyder decided to do was have the villian be someone who Superman could unleash on. This leads to a frantic, camera shaking, motion sickness inducing final fight."
"May 4, 2013",POSITIVE,best Superman MOVIE ever.
"May 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It was a good movie, but it was a disappointment at the same time. I recommend seeing it in theaters, but don't expect anything like the Dark Knight such as we had all hoped for. There was such an opportunity it's to bring the audience in and have them fall In love with Clark Kent and Superman, but it almost seems like we knew more about Zod and Jor-El by the time it was over. I felt estranged to Kent and Superman."
"May 3, 2013",POSITIVE,A much darker tone to this Superman reboot but it worked well. Heavy on the CGI & things going boom but isn't that what summer blockbusters are all about?
"May 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Man Of Steel was definitely better than the last Superman flick, for sure. Kind of felt like they went a bit over board on the ""action"" scenes. But overall a great, fun story."
"May 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"fast, entertaining and a superhero movie worth watch!
But definately not a 56% !"
"May 3, 2013",POSITIVE,It was an excellent movie and I think it focuses on Superman's story more than the old movies.
"May 3, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Visually amazing and great talent. One huge giveaway within the first 30 mins that I just CANNOT forgive being a huge Superman fan! I won't tell you what it is but if you know your comics and the Superman storyline, you won't like it either."
"May 3, 2013",NEGATIVE,Too much blah blah blah and not enough shirtless. They almost turned it into chick flick.
"May 3, 2013",NEGATIVE,Far too many pointless super vs super fight scenes where they destroy the area while remaining uninjured themselves.  The plot wasn't bad otherwise - but I was seriously looking for the exit when yet another of these tedious battles took place.
"May 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"At least they gave a good makeup of planet Krypton, cool costumes and great sci-fi effects.  Too bad that the story went very fast.  But overall, it's a good job in reviving the Superman franchise."
"May 3, 2013",POSITIVE,I thought the movie was amazing.
"May 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"Very good and nearly super, tempering some of the action with more character development would have helped."
"May 3, 2013",POSITIVE,This is by far the best Superman film since the Christopher Reeve era...Rest in Peace Superman Returns!!!
"May 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"I don't know what movie these so called ""top critics"" saw, but it wasn't Man of Steel. This latest incarnation of Superman does not deserve the rating it currently has. While not perfect, and a little bit too fast paced at the beginning, this movie never has a dull moment, and it brings Superman as he is meant to be. This is the Superman of the comics, and I can't wait to see more of him."
"May 3, 2013",NEGATIVE,too many spoilers to write just wanna let it be known that i was painfully disappointed but than again super man is over rated
"May 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"Pretty Awesome!  Cavil and Adams nailed Super and Lois.  Michael Shannon was terrific as Zod, but Terrence Stamp will always be him in my mind.  Action was great, solid writing and directing.  My only complaint would be it seemed to drag a little in the third act, but not detrimentally.  I'll definitely be picking this up on Blu-Ray."
"May 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great movie, I love Superman II from back in the day this one I think tells the story better."
"May 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Good action scenes. Not much plot line, but you don't need one with good action."
"May 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"Best Superman to date, glade they didn't go through all his child hood again lol.."
"May 3, 2013",POSITIVE,It brought the superman saga back up
"May 3, 2013",POSITIVE,Best superman film excluding the original that I have seen to date. Good movie.
"May 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"Although the realistic approach may not be suited well for this movie.  The sci-fi aspect and die-hard ""Easter eggs"" make this movie more compelling than the predecessors.  Cast is on key with the exception of Amy Adams lack of character - with also Superman's relationship with Louis Lane and Faora-Ul's too inflated importance."
"May 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,Minor plot issues and a messiah complex doesn't hold back how good the action was. Worth a watch for any comic fan.
"May 3, 2013",POSITIVE,Henry Cavill owns it as Superman. Overall a solid DC movie
"May 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie is definitely on track in making ""Superman"" more than a comic book hero! The acting was superb! I don't think they could have found anyone better to play ""The Men of Steel"", other than Henry Cavill. Amy Adams, Russell Crowe, Diane Lane and Kevin Costner's performances were superb. As well as Michael Shannon as General Zod. If you are as big of a fan of ""Superman"" as I am this movie is worth adding to your DVD collection. Action packed and the effects were incredible!"
"May 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"With the action sequences, Hans Zimmer's musical score, the acting from the cast, its storytelling, costume concepts and the visual effects being the top notches.

Its pacing issue brings nothing but a forgettable throughout the films middle stage."
"May 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great set up movie. Can't wait to see the next one to see what superman is really like. Good to watch once for the story, don't pay too close attention to the long establishing shots. Also there might be some unnecessary zooming shots."
"May 3, 2013",POSITIVE,I'd compare it to a batman begins and the dark knight. Great movie and very action packed
"May 3, 2013",NEGATIVE,Why can't anyone just make a good Superman movie? There were so many problems with this one I don't even know where to start.
"May 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"Short and sweet,this is the best Superman film ever made!!!!!!"
"May 3, 2013",POSITIVE,This a must see.  I'm going to see it again.
"May 3, 2013",POSITIVE,"This film... WAS FUCKING EPIC!!!!! Maybe it still has some glitch in plot, but so far.... THIS.IS.ONE.OF.THE.MOST.POWERFUL.MOVIE.I.EVER.SAW!!!!!"
"May 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,Not perfect but not bad just wish the storytelling was better. Disappointed from what the trailers showed me
"May 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"I was a bit confused about the rating being so low, but now that I have seen MOS these critics have only shown that they live in the past and was expecting to see a Donner film. Snyder has delivered tenfold and you would be foolish if you choose to skip this movie. We finally have a SUPERMAN that will take us into a wider Justice League movie! This will probably be the last review and possibly the last time I come to check on how a movie is doing score wise. I can no longer believe anything this site says. Never have so many critics been so wrong! Glorified Fanboys and Fangirls who should be ignored! Go and see this movie! Amazing!"
"Apr 18, 2013",POSITIVE,I'll be the first person in line to see it .
"Apr 18, 2013",POSITIVE,So very much looking forward to seeing this movie. It is the only one I HAVE to see.
"Apr 18, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Following the success of the Dark Knight Trilogy it was perhaps inevitable that given Tinseltown's current obsession with superhero films that Superman would be next film to appear. However, this is a film that promises much but fails to deliver. 

The film is split into four chunks. The first deals with the infant child's escape from a dying planet Krypton with Russell Crowe playing Superman's biological father, a role originally made famous by Marlon Brando. This part is disappointing and frustratingly short. There's little explanation why the planet is dying or why the parents are electing to send their son to another planet. It's just assumed that the audience knows. 

Part two is better. In this part, the young Superman is struggling to cope with his powers and responsibilities and in order to keep these hidden he's become a nomad, moving from place to place, never staying. It's told in a series of flashbacks and this is the best part of the film. The audience can empathise with the character and his difficulties and whether to reveal his true identity. 

Part three sees the arrival of the Kryptonian super-villans, led by General Zod. A massive battle takes place in the town of Smallville between Superman, the baddies and the US military. This part is also good, and there is enough action to keep the audiences entertained. 

Unfortunately, at this point the director, has decided that this action was not enough which leads us to the mess that is part four. This is the fight in the city between Superman and General Zod. This just seems to be how many buildings can we destroy. It's hard to follow, poorly shot and just a mess. And the annoying part of it is....totally unnecessary. 

This film could and should have been a good film. There are good performances. Henry Carvil, whilst no Christopher Reeve, is good as the troubled super-hero. In addition, Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner both play their roles as Superman's 'fathers' very well. However, that has to be balanced as the actress playing Lois Lane could not be any more wooden if they planted her and called her a tree. 

This is probably the most disappointing film I've seen in a while. It's not as bad as Superman Returns. However it's on a par with Superman 4. If you want to see a good Superman film, my advice is to go for Superman 2...."
"Apr 18, 2013",POSITIVE,best film i seen for ages
"Apr 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"Although the final fight scene is unnecessary and drags down an otherwise superb film, this is still one of the best comic book adaptations ever. The cast is exuberant, Crowe is transcendent, Costner is subtly brilliant and Cavill has the perfect amount of strength mixed with a withdrawn sensibility. Adams is serviceable as usual, (she's good here but I find she's better in roles with stronger characters - see The Master for some brilliant work), and Shannon shines in a role he was born to play. Shannon is an underrated master of his craft. On top of all the acting is some wonderful self aware writing with a keen director in Snyder and delightful cinematography. I'm sorry, but as far as Superman films go, this is the best. It has some flaws but ultimately, it's the cream of the crop. You won't be disappointed, and it's well worth seeing on the big screen. It's on par with Nolan's Batman films, and among those stands apart from the other comic book films of late. Superman is rooted in humanistic struggles. 

That being said, (see it), it is haunting and shocking to see a city laid to waste (and likely thousands) in a final, unnecessary fight scene, especially when that city has had it's fair share of hardships."
"Apr 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"Very enjoyable movie, starts off like a Sci-Fi movie and then goes into origins and then destruction!!!  Like the new take/direction this will be going into towards the future, reminds me of the animated Superman and JL shows..."
"Apr 18, 2013",POSITIVE,I can't help myself. It was a great movie and I've been a Superman fan since I was a kid.
"Apr 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"May not be everyones cup of tea, but i loved the depth of the story, bringing up the struggles clark would have faced as a child, without overly complicating it. Nolan has done a great job... Very batman begins!"
"Apr 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,"not up to my expectations. better than iron man 3 and thts nt a compliment. this may have the best effects you'l ever see and the action scenes are very well choreographed, tht said its a very uneven film which could have been so much better with the talents involved"
"Apr 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Man of Steel was a great. There was the origins of the hero's life, intense builds and tons and tons of insane action sequences. The film really showed just how heroic and powerful Superman can really be, with enough seriousness and geekyness for an awesome fanboy joyride. There was a 'something' missing from the film, but something that didn't take away too much from the rest of it."
"Apr 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Com a inten√ß√£o de criar um novo universo para o Super Homem e seus super amigos, o filme requenta  a origem do her√≥i, que j√° foi vista em diversas m√≠dias, inclusive em Superman - O Filme.
Ainda assim, a nova vers√£o do homem de a√ßo √© bem interessante.
Pena que no √∫ltimo ato o filme involui para uma a√ß√£o desenfreada e pouco original."
"Apr 18, 2013",POSITIVE,I loved this movie! I think this is the perfect Superman film & it definitely could lead places for the DC cinematic universe!
"Apr 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Better than Iron Man 3 and The Dark Knight Rises combined... not sure why the critics rated this as low as they did.
"Apr 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"Wow, what an epic action superhero movie. Big & bold, a movie that finally shows off his power and his scale.  It feels a little rushed at times, but I would bet that Warner Bros had a huge say in how long the running time should be. So bring on the Blu-Ray extended edition/Directors Cut and soon please.  Oh and by the way, the huge numbers of people that had a problem with the amount of destruction and decimation in the movie, I have two words: Pacific Rim (which is also a highly enjoyable movie too). Those people/critics should stick to watching movies like Devil Wears Prada."
"Apr 18, 2013",POSITIVE,this movie was awesome. I have no clue what the critics were talking about. it will always give way to other DC movies!
"Apr 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"As a huge Superman fan, I am a little bias when it comes to this movie but I went to the showing with a bunch of friends who are huge Batman fans and they loved it too.  The fighting sequences in the movie look like they should, there is total and utter destruction of the surrounding environment, it looks like the comics or the cartoon versions of the character as far as scope of destruction.  The character development and story arc is great and easily followed by non-fans of the character.  The ending fight scene, although it felt right for the movie, was not the way I saw it ending or the character choice we would expect.  Overall amazing movie, best in my opinion!"
"Apr 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,"It's hard to review this movie because the good parts are good and the bad parts are so relentless. Too many special effects, not enough story, a nonsensical plot, boring characters, and most of all it's a complete mess. A swing and a miss."
"Apr 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome movie.  Finally Superman nails it on the big screen.
"Apr 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"I guess the trailers made me expect too much out of this but for what it's worth, it was still pretty damn good. Hans Zimmer yet again provides a powerful score that fit the film. Performances were pretty good, though superman's performance was kinda uninspiring to say the least. In terms of badassery, Faora stole the show in my opinion. And of course. Snyder didn't miss in his huge action and destruction sequences."
"Apr 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Totally blew my eyeballs and mind! Loved the fresh approach they took with this Superman movie. Sans undies on the outside, a very HOT superman, a very ethical Louis Lane, and all just a little darker, more technical and an insight into his home planet!... and did I mention the scene when SM emerges from the lake?... phwoah!!... ladies, worth it for that 7 seconds alone."
"Apr 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Wow, I can't wait for this to come out."
"Apr 17, 2013",POSITIVE,THE FILM OF THE YEAR 2013 AN EPIC MASTERPIECE
"Apr 17, 2013",POSITIVE,go see it. very good storyline
"Apr 17, 2013",POSITIVE,This Superman Movie pull no punches!! Sadly with a rushed pacing at the beginning. But this is how Superman should be done. A really satisfying treatment & answer on what should you do to spandex-wearing-boy-scout superhero.
"Apr 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is an excellent retelling of a very bland superhero.  Those who didn't like it seem to have not been paying attention.  It was a good story retelling of a character that is 70 years old.  So if you are thinking about Christopher Reeve when you think about seeing it, do people a favor and don't comment badly on a movie because it is not what YOU expected.  The story on its own is flat out awesome.  HATERS GONNA HATE.... I don't even like Superman, but it wasn't about ""superman"" is was about a the Man of Steel.  So all the bad reviews seem to be from narrow minded people who were wanting to rent the original Superman 1,2 and 3....guess what....its been 20 years and there more than one way to tell his story.   Move on and just admit you know nothing about modern comics nor this particular character.  Everyone who know Superman in the comics knows, it needed this type of retelling or you would never seen superman in a movie again.  This version keeps the fable of superman alive, current, realistic, and realistic.  NOT SAVING CATS FROM TREES!"
"Apr 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Action was good but too much going on a robe time to keep up with
"Apr 17, 2013",POSITIVE,I liked it! Not sure why the low critic score. I really liked Watchmen too so guess I'm a sucker for ZS
"Apr 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"a refreshing take on the storyline, set pieces galore, and Michael Shannon tearing it up as general zod, what is not too like!! with an extended look at krypton, Russell Crowe is no mere Brando star cameo, but essential to the plotline and development, he adds charisma and empathy to his character Jor-El! kevin Costner however is very much underused in the flashbacks of Jonathan Kent, which is a shame! but this is only a minor blip! the film as a whole hardly lets you rest as it jimps from set piece to set piece, which for me was great! but the success and secret weapon of the film was the casting of Shannon as general Zod, he just steals and owns every scene hes in directly and indirectly (the viral message, so sinister and effective) cavill also plays superman with great charisma and holds his own to the other bigger named cast members! so all in all a great film for all the family! a must watch!! :D"
"Apr 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Spectacular summer blockbuster and a welcome return to the most iconic superhero of all! Makes the cleanup after the avengers had finished seem like a spring clean. Very enjoyable action, sometimes to the detriment of the story though, hence missing that half a star. But overall brilliant addition to the superhero genre. Will be looking forward to the sequel."
"Apr 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,If your in need of a nap this is the movie to see.  I didn't think anything could be worse then superman returns.  I was so wrong. This movie missed on soooo many levels. No humor at all. Far to dark for superman. The characters were one dimensional. I was expecting a lot lot more. The characters from smallville should have made the jump to the big screen. That was a recipe for success!
"Apr 17, 2013",POSITIVE,EPIC!!!!!!!   Man of Steel is great!!!!  love the new dark side of superman.  Finally the movie all fans wanted!!!!   Zack Snyder did a great job with superman cant wait for the sequel and for Justice League
"Apr 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,"This Superman leaves more of a mess than earlier ones. His hair always remains in place, which is what I would expect from someone with super powers."
"Apr 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,What a disappointing piece of shit.
"Apr 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"I just have to say for man of steel to get a 57 percent right now is the crazyest thing i every seen.Why would anyone even listen to dum people reviews in the first place.To me rotten is a place were people dont review film's they just bash and bitch about every little thing they WISH they had in the film.And there people on this site that call themself's movie buff's.No u are not movie buff's u are pure Rotten movie Buff's.there is nothing u can say to my mind that this movie is bad.i am sick of seeing people telling me tht they wont see this film because they herd it was bad.Stop judgeing a book by it's cover and it it .The film is wonderful in every single way.There is so muc from story to action action packed.Fantastic film,in every single way This film is truley the way a superman film need's to be the way it is."
"Apr 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Bout time superman has some enemy's that weren't pussys! Ace film !!
"Apr 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Super-AMAZING and Super-AWESOME.
"Apr 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Good special effects, shame about the story."
"Apr 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Beautifully shoot and visually amazing. A little bit slow, but Man of Steel is a good start for a new franchise."
"Apr 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superhero Movie EVER!!!!
"Apr 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Fun film, take the family, especially the boys! Critics need to enjoy this film for what it is."
"Apr 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man Of Steel was amazingly epic!

This is my first review√¢¬¶I√¢(TM)m sure more will come along√¢¬¶but for the sake of not spoiling it for those who haven√¢(TM)t seen it here it goes:

I think this is the best superman movie in a long time to come, without dis-honoring any of the previous Superman movies. We need to learn to view them as separate work to see the Man Of Steel as it should be. You can tell the director is giving us more background to the character and his parents in the initial scenes. I enjoyed having the serious dark side to it, as this gives it more push to a more realistic tone. I would have liked little more humor in the movie to laugh a bit more, but not a big deal, that√¢(TM)s very minor and does not make the movie fail. The sequence in the beginning to where it takes us to the climax builds up with Clarks memories growing up facing the difficulty of not understanding who he is. And why his earthly father is avoiding his discovery.

I can tell Zack Snyder tried to give it origin for Kal that I almost want to say it tried to follow a Superman begins patter like in the Dark Knight. Perhaps my guess is accepting a bit of Nolan√¢(TM)s input led to this but it didn√¢(TM)t quite work with superman as it did with Batman begins. Still, not a fail for this movie√¢¬¶because there is other good things that balance it out. The only other thing that I could say is the fighting sequences were a bit over powered√¢¬¶They could have toned down just little to allow the audience to enjoy more of Superman√¢(TM)s fighting technique instead of brutally throwing a truck or him getting knocked 50 building away from his enemy before we can get back to the action. But again, not a reason to fail the movie.

Remember this movie is a re-boot and I think they took it from the very beginning as much as they could, so it is not a fail that it didn√¢(TM)t have kryptonite missing as his weakness. At least not in this first movie. Am I saying there will be more to come? I think there will be. So a lot of what was √¢missing√¢? in my honest opinion is not really missing, it was just not in this first part. Not with the way it ended.

I truly enjoyed the action, the effects, the acting was great√¢¬¶ I like how it gave more of an emphasis on his parents making the right choice for his life and planet and the purpose his father gave him. Freedom to be a symbol of hope, and good.

If you√¢(TM)re a true superhero fan, Man Of Steel will be seen as a separate film to the previous Christopher Reeve films, and avoid comparing it to get the true feel of this new epic Superman! Enjoy!"
"Apr 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"To be honest  I don't know why some of the critics didn't like Man Of Steel. I thought it was a'lot better then certain superhero movies that has come out recently, (""Instead ""The Dark Knight""and ""The Avengers"") Sure the movie has certain problems but I thought the Origin story was great and I haven't scene a great origin story for a while. 

And it's a different and unique take on Superman and I like different and originality for once and a while. Man Of Steel isn't a perfect  superhero movie and it does have some problems buts it's certainly a great summer film. 

The big problem with the movie is that I didn't get emotionally attached to the main characters with Clark Kent and Lois Lane, and I felt there chemistry was to force to believe that they have feelings or chemistry for one another. And some of the dialogue   shouldn't have never been in the movie (Quote""He's kind of hot"")  ""that was a corny ""Thor moment"". 

But there's a'lot of positive things about this movie with story and the plot, ""I thought going into the movie that the story was going to be lacking because it was obviously being directed Zack Snyder, but the plot and the story was really great, and there's a'lot of emotionally scenes that got me choked up at certain point with Clark Kent and Pa Kent, I thought there scenes was really emotional and heavy at points. 

Michael Shannon as General Zod was great, I thought he gave a great performance and you really understand where he's coming from and he actually think he's doing a good motive. ""And I think the best villains are the ones you understand and the ones that think they are doing good deed for the better good of there people and General Zod was a very three layer character that you understand his motive and he thinks that he's trying do good. 

And the action was great obviously, it's probably the best action I've scene in a Superhero movie, "" no lie"". Man Of Steel has flaws but overall it's a enjoyable movie and it's a'lot better than certain super hero movies."
"Apr 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"The newest silver screen reboot of one of the most popular superheroes of all time has divided fans and critics alike. There does not seem to be a middle ground here. You either loved Man of Steel or you hated it. I absolutely loved it, the reason is because there were logical changes to the source material yet it did not veer far off the tangent. 

Now after the disaster of 2006's Superman Returns, I felt that the Last Son of Krypton just could not be played by anyone but Christopher Reeve, and that Superman II was the last good film in this series. Thankfully, with Christopher Nolan's guidance and David S. Goyer's story (he also wrote the Batman reboot Batman Begins which incidentally is my favourite film of that trilogy), this installment starts off the right step towards what I hope is a Justice League film in the near future.

The best part of the films was sans-action for me. The lengthy prologue scenes on Krypton (hugely influenced by similar scenes in 1978's Superman) were fantastic; the repartee between Jor-El & Zod was great. It showed that both of them ultimately strove for the same goal yet had diametrically opposite routes to get there.

The film then delves in a Nolan-esque non-linear narrative with constant flashbacks. The flashbacks were also a good way of showing Clark's childhood instead of having an origins prologue that included Clark's beginning on Earth. In fact, the scene of Clark first discovering his powers in his elementary classroom was one of my favourite scenes of the film, with the child actor really portraying how a kid who thought he was normal was actually different. More than any other Superman film since the 1978 one, Man of Steel reminds us over & over that Superman isn't human, yet the Clark Kent in him is as human as us.

The action scenes were somewhat repetitive, but I liked it nevertheless. It also made me wonder, if Zack Snyder could be the right man for a Dragon Ball Z reboot because of the fight scenes in the air!

Snyder's touch is very apparent in those action scenes where Faora & Nam-Ek first wrecked Smallville in the battle with Superman before General Zod & Superman literally crushed Metropolis into a heap of rubble. This is derivative in all superhero films of this era i.e. New York was destroyed in The Avengers. Now, Zod unleashing his World Engine to terraform Earth into a new Krypton and in doing so destroys much of what is in its way; is totally understandable as he is a villain. Why Snyder in all his wisdom decided to allow Superman to annihilate Metropolis in the guise of battling Zod is a puzzle to me. It was not needed; perhaps something different could have been done. The ending was not a big surprise to me, as Superman has killed before in the comics & even in Superman II, and in that scene, it can be clearly seen how much it pained him to resort to that. It may be, that this was the act that made Superman swore off killing his enemies in the first place.

The absence of John Williams's signature Superman theme was somewhat alleviated by Hans Zimmer's fantastic uplifting score. His new theme was great and the score throughout the film was fantastic.

Henry Cavill shines as Kal-El, showing his struggle between his real self and his shadow on Earth, he also looked the part when he first donned the cape too. It is only as Clark Kent where he falls slightly short of emulating the amusing antics of Christopher Reeve or even the small town charm of Tom Welling. Since it's his first outing and we didn't really see Clark Kent that much, I'll give it a pass (hell it was thoroughly better than Brandon Routh).

Michael Shannon is suitably cast as General Zod, menacing in his stare and steadfast in his aim to see Krypton be born again. Russell Crowe & Kevin Costner played their father figure roles fantastically well surpassing their counterparts from previous iterations.  It was strange to see Goyer dispensing away with the canonical death of Pa Kent (he died of a heart attack in all previous adaptations) instead going for a more harrowing death scene, which I'm sure shaped Clark's psyche. Amy Adams needs to convince me that she can be a Lois Lane, while Diane Lane did well as Ma Kent. 

I loved the fact that they took a different direction with regards to his costume, the Fortress of Solitude and the 'S' symbol. It is not as if they deviated totally, as the costume (Kryptonian Armor) has appeared in The New 52 comic series while the 'S' being the House of El sigil appeared in the  Superman: Birthright comic series. I also loved the easter eggs that littered the film, hinting at the future of this series, and maybe even a Justice League film in the making. The most prominent seems to hint that the sequel's villain will be Superman's arch nemesis, Lex Luthor. This included the Lexcorp logo appearing on the top of tower, a Lexcorp truck drops Clark off at the barn, the side of a tanker bearing a Lexcorp logo during final fight between Zod & Superman and the appearance of a Lexcorp construction site. 

Those that hinted at a broader Justice League were the Wayne Industries logo on the satellite when Superman & Zod battle in outer space, the empty pod in the Fortress of Solitude that hinted that it could be Kara Zor-El aka Super Girl who was the first to arrive on Earth, the presence of Captain Farris who shares the same name as Hal Jordan aka Green Lantern's girlfriend & finally Dr. Emil Hamilton who would go on to head S.T.A.R Labs (which will be instrumental in the creation of Cyborg).

On the whole, this is not for those that loved Iron Man 3 which was witty & charming. Man of Steel was moody, cerebral & very intense and that was what made it great for me. It was a triumphant return to the silver screen for Kal El, and I hope this is the beginning of wonderful journey for future DC films."
"Apr 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"man of steel is not with out it's flaws but it is a fantastic reimagining of the origin story of Superman. It was well written minus a few minor things. The acting was fantastic, visually stunning and action packed.  Great job!"
"Apr 17, 2013",POSITIVE,this is to the negative critics. us normal people wanted the action that has lacked in the superman movies. its a re-boot so im sorry if it wasnt lovey dovey for u.
"Apr 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Big Superman Fan.  loved the movie
"Apr 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Man Of Steel has definitely got its up and downs. Its cast of characters has an endless amount of potential backgrounds and storylines to explore but unfortuantely this fim just does not have the depth or complexity to make any value of that. Man Of Steel feels rushed in many ways. The relationships created in this film have nearly zero development and makes it feel as if they are just there as a nod to the source material. Superman and Lois Lane's relationship highlights this problem, they seem to have no chemistry and even when the potential of this is being hinted at it is overcome by another repetitive action scene. Zack Snyders vividly visual mind is most definitely on display throughout the whole movie. But again like many of his movies it is just used in the wrong way. All the action sequences look visually stunning but have no intenisty. Even when Superman and General Zod are flying through buildings, it seems as its just normal. This may be a result of just how many of these sort of scenes there are in this film. The film takes away nearly any morals from Superman and also much character development. The flashbacks which are the only source of Clark Kent's character building are done very well and the relationship he has with Kevin Costners character is one of the stand out parts of the film. But sadly this does not carry through to present day. Man Of Steel ultimately is a mess of  repetitive action sequences, a cheesy and sometimes predictable script and a too simple storyline. But it does have some characteristics of a good film which mostly comes from overall world building and the performances from Henry Cavil and Kevin Costner, who unlike the rest of the cast actually become their roles. It would just be nice to see some development within the characters and them to have more of an emotional draw to eachother and to the audience."
"Apr 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Amazing!!! Show much action, I think it was one of the best movies I've ever seen, surpassed my expectations! Way better then the last superman!"
"Apr 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome will watch it again
"Apr 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Utterly fantastic and visually stunning.
"Apr 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Very cool!! Brought memorize back of when I was a kid watching Christopher Reeves!!
"Apr 16, 2013",POSITIVE,A new twist to the all time favorite movie.  Man of steel starts the movie how it should have been started and ended the movie with a galactic proportion of battle action sequence.  They put in all the action and took out the drama and the romance.  The best special effects movie ever made of Superman.
"Apr 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Zack Snyder's Man of Steel is a huge film, in every sense! Is an outstanding super-hero movie, with fantastic special effects, great acting, an inteligent plot full of symbolism and the most human recounting of the Superman tale i have seen, but it's more than everything a movie about hope in these hard times we're living, a different take on the Superman story, more faithfull to the comics. A different Superman that looks perfectly molded for our times. Don't mind about what the critics have said about it, Man of Steel is a total blast."
"Apr 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"(8.5/10)
Although there is a bit too much action/destruction, the Lois Lane character seemed forced and the some lines are bad, this film was better than good, it was just as good Batman Begins. The cast was great, the story was brilliant and fresh, the VFX were beyond decent, and the movie was a good start as a beginning of the DC Cinematic Universe.

This wasn't a great year for Marvel and DC to compete, besides The Wolverine and Thor: The Dark World, but it looks like for me, DC wins. This was a great movie. The critics of Rotten Tomatoes cannot be trusted!"
"Apr 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,Better than Superman Returns. Fun but totally lack in humor and charm - with the exception of the sexy and charismatic Henry Cavill. Destruction overkill went on 30 minutes too long. In a post 9-11 world was it really necessary to level Smallville and reduce the entire city of Metropolis to rubble? Superman-The Movie still best screen adaptation by far.
"Apr 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Bummed that the Tomatometer isn't higher because I quite enjoyed this version of Superman.  Maybe a few too many flashbacks and fly-fighting into NYC high-rises, but didn't feel overly gratuitous.  And, helloooooo HCavs!"
"Apr 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Wow, what a great movie"
"Apr 16, 2013",POSITIVE,"Not a damn thing wrong with this movie. The soundtrack was perfect, the acting was great, amazing action moments, a great story, and the little hints to other DC characters was exciting. What will come next?"
"Apr 16, 2013",POSITIVE,great movie.  this generations Superman movie.  Loved it
"Apr 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,it's just so soulless. the action is good but it's impossible to care about anything happening on screen. I felt like I was watching a 2 hour long beard razor commercial. what wasted potential.
"Apr 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Yet another mindless action flick, Man of Steel lasts about an hour too long and is full of ridiculous unintentional comedy."
"Apr 16, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Well this was a big disappointment! Can't quite put my finger on what it was but I just wasn't feeling this latest reboot. Christopher Nolan on board should have a produced a much slicker and rounded film than what they made for $225m. The choice to put some cheap 3D conversion on was a mistake and a money-making decision for greater revenue, it isn't worth the extra money. The best thing about this film is that Michael Shannon will finally get the recognition he deserves!"
"Apr 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A good film, but a weak script makes it fall short of greatness."
"Apr 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Good but not great. A Zach Snyder film for sure. Fight scenes were outstanding and the music was amazing by Hans zimmer!!
"Apr 16, 2013",POSITIVE,Loved it! I am huge fan of superman and I loved to see the new film!
"Apr 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Not the classic we were hoping for but a fun time all the same. With Snyder at the helm, I suppose that's an achievement. 7/10."
"Apr 16, 2013",POSITIVE,The CGI was amazing! a great way to reboot the franchise.
"Apr 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,Lots and lots of destruction. I mean like a crap ton of it.
"Apr 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The trailers made the movie look better than it was; although it wasn't bad. The real fault lies with the script, and I can't even believe Nolan was a co-writer for this movie. The film was overly long, it needed more ""show, don't tell,"" better character development, and definitely fewer explosions and punches, even for a superhero flick. After about the 50th explosion it started losing its wow factor; basically, better pacing and spacing and reason for grandiose action sequences. If the rest of the movie was more like the last 3rd of it, with the emotion and the feeling of actually getting somewhere, it would've been better. If they make a sequel out of this, I look forward to it as long as it is better written. Though the sequences became too much, the special effects were absolutely beautiful, as was the man in tights."
"Apr 16, 2013",POSITIVE,best ever superman film
"Apr 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,Full of great action but didn't feel connected with the characters
"Apr 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"The best Superman movie EVER! I love how the movie progression was fast for us who follow the story, because i didnt want to see it all over again like the other movies. plus it gives just enought story for those who are new to the Superman. I love the action, and the pg 13 violence. sound effects and visuals were fenomenal. What did throw me off is the story is a little bit different from what I am use to but trust me this new and revamp Superman will want to wish they make more sequals. My friends and I DO NOT regreat watching it!"
"Apr 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Excellent movie... It showed how pure and humble superman is. Even though he did something tragic he still suffered for what he did.... This movie was really emotional and heart-warming
"Apr 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Kal-El vs Zod epic battle
"Apr 15, 2013",POSITIVE,I have seen every super hero movie in the past decade. This is the best super hero movie I've ever seen. No question. Buy it.
"Apr 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Well placed scenes!!!
"Apr 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"Love this film it's not a bad remake it has an excellent storyline and a refreshing approach to a new audience which unfortunately is a very  hard task, your not going to beat Christopher Reeves version but this origin story is close to the original superman comic were he finds out about krypton for the first. I thought it was a commendable effort and should be given a chance."
"Apr 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Blew my mind really good
"Apr 15, 2013",POSITIVE,This is the superman I've been waiting for.
"Apr 15, 2013",POSITIVE,This is the Superman I have always wanted to see on the Big screen. The critics may whine it's nothing like the Donner films. I think that's good. Because I never did like them anyway.
"Apr 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,"A plot would have been nice, and no, I realize  that Michael Bay changed the summer blockbuster game, but ""stuff blows up"" is still NOT a plot. And...y'know, guys, you're dealing with classic literary icons here, no joke: a little respect? It's only arrogance to imagine you can somehow improve on Siegel and Schuster's original backstory. 

I'm a fan of Amy Adams, but she is SOOO not Lois Lane. Lana Lang was a redhead. Laurence Fishburne is one of our finest actors, but he's totally wasted here in a part Regis Philbin could have handled. 

The film is completely devoid of any joy, or warmth, or  fun. There's no one to like, or even care about here, Kal-El least of all. When the stony, flat-toned Kevin Costner is your most sympathetic character, you have a problem. 

Bottom line: two and a half hours of waiting for the movie to start."
"Apr 15, 2013",POSITIVE,"An all out assault on the senses, this film barely takes a pause for breath. A strong cast make the most of the few quieter moments, before the action kicks in again. Michael Shannon is great as Zod, and despite my initial reservations, Amy Adams was a good Lois Lane. The action sequences are breathtakingly quick and well constructed. It lacks some of the humour that was present in the original films which is a bit of a shame, but it doesn't ruin the film."
"Apr 15, 2013",POSITIVE,Man of Steel was a very good reboot of the Superman franchise. the movie does have flaws for sure but overall very well made.
"Apr 15, 2013",NEGATIVE,it was ok. wasn't great. Cavil's Superman was nothing special
"Apr 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Much better than Superman Rebound which I felt suffered mostly from a really bad script  
Cavell fits the suit and holds up well. More modern take on the Superman story. 
Script flows well , everyone plays part with feeling. I must say for me the standout pieces are the 2 young Clark Kents. Lads to follow well done. Looking forward to part 2."
"Apr 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Superman with a new story and a new main.  I enjoyed it, but I would love to see movies stick to the original stories sometimes."
"Apr 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman I have ever seen! I hope they continue these! :)
"Apr 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Finally! A superman movie that's actually a scifi action movie!
"Apr 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Somewhat jumpy editing aside, Man of Steel is a truly epic reboot to the beloved icon."
"Apr 14, 2013",POSITIVE,the way superman should be seen the world not understanding him and his power and scared of it in many ways!!! same director as the as dark night box office hit
"Apr 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome! A must see in IMax 3D
"Apr 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Probably my most anticipated movie of this Summer and i have to say I was not let down. Overall a good storytelling and interesting backstory and look at Krypton. For the complaints regarding an excess of destruction: there certainly was no lack of buildings being demolished although I didn't find it distracting or obtrusive. People need to learn to take superhero movies for what they are.
"Apr 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel had a real comic book feel to it, which understandably has turned off some viewers.  The dialogue seems that it could fit into speech bubbles and the majority of the movie is action.  However, the movie holds its own with incredible action scenes reminiscent of an issue of Action Comics, and has the dark overtones that would allow this version of Superman to work well with Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight universe."
"Apr 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man is still very good version of Superman done delivers new stuff about Krypton and showing few things off one Clark was the kid and I'm discovering I'm self to be a superhero he is. Very good special effects in a very great cast Henry Cavill is the great Superman and Michael Shannon is a very good General Zod and the rest of the casts does Kevin Costner Diane Lane Laurence Fishburne Amy Adams and Russell Crowe. (2013). 
A"
"Apr 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"I liked this movie. it was well put together, it really brought everything together well!"
"Apr 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,An entertaining watch though a little too much violence and action for my liking. I would watch the sequel. And Cavil is certainly easy on the eye.
"Apr 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,Liked it better than all of the other superman movies. It is a much more realistic and believable take on the lore.
"Apr 14, 2013",POSITIVE,Not your grandfathers Superman. This is as close to real life iteration of Superman will ever come. Impeccable action sequences that have redefined the meaning of the word.
"Apr 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"First half was quite good, and the story built up nicely but everything was lost in the last 30-40 minutes of prolonged destruction..."
"Apr 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Snyder- Nolan- Goyer team gives us Man of Steel, and it is not Superman. It gives us Clark, a self-imposed outcast, who becomes Kal El, the man with his native planet's future in his hand. It is the conflict between his two powers: Kryptonian strength vs human values given to him by his foster parents at play. He needs to choose between the only survivors of his planet and the people of Earth. Being a good man is not enough to let you choose between your native civilization and the one you hardly trust and this makes him Man of Steel, the silently caring but invincible & ruthless alien not yet loved by people but feared for obvious reasons. He makes a choice of killing the last person from his planet to save humans, taking a leap of faith which will in the future make him Superman, the most beloved superhero of all.
This is the movie Superman's origin deserved. Sequence after sequence, the scope and spectacle dazzle the audience as Henry Cavill shows that he isn't the Superman to come back after a week to kick the guy who splashed coffee at him but he retaliates in 5 minutes and leaves no one wounded. He has strong values but inherent anger. True to the comic book hero."
"Apr 14, 2013",POSITIVE,The best super man ever
"Apr 14, 2013",POSITIVE,I don't know why the critics are being so harsh to the movie. I think it was truly a great superman movie. The action was incredible as well.
"Apr 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"Even though this film doesn't care at all about building Superman's character, this film delivers with amazing effects and great direction. In 3D is spectacular."
"Apr 14, 2013",POSITIVE,"The critics have spoken and the critics are wrong. Last year they widely claimed that both Prometheus and The Dark Knight Rises were great. They weren't. They were the two most rancid stinkers of 2012.
This year, they're panning Man of Steel. Wrong again. It's a fantastic reboot. I'd even go so far as to say I prefer it over the Christopher Reeve-era Superman. It's a reboot that confidently holds it sights on it's own future and it's own perspective (much like Nolan's Batman reboot did with 'Batman Begins'.) The film doesn't even attempt to pander to cheap audience nostalgia or even pay paper-thin tributes to what has come before (unlike the dreadful Star Trek sequel of earlier this year.) What it does do is take the character and give him a fresh modern spin; Superman is first and foremost an alien, an intergalactic refugee, and as a result, he is subject to the fear and hostility of the humans that he has hid amongst for all his young adulthood. This has always seemed like an obvious problem for the character, yet no Superman film has ever addressed it before. This film does, and spectacularly so.
I don't want to post spoilers, but what I will say is this: later in the film, Cavill's Superman has to deal with a moral dilemma that Reeve's man of steel never had the misfortune of facing, and as a result, the character of Superman is given a depth that he has never had in previous incarnations; coupled with great performances from a stellar cast, jaw-dropping actions set-pieces and a solid heart-felt score from Hans Zimmer, Man of Steel has shed the skin of an over-bearing Hollywood past and polished off a timeless character who was in grave danger of gathering dust. Go see it."
"Apr 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,"By no means perfect, Man of Steel delivers as a modern retelling of the Superman mythos, and knocks it out of the park as an awe-inspiringly incredible action movie."
"Apr 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I tried tempering my expectations going in, but just can't help getting excited about a Superman movie. Not surprisingly though, Zack Snyder disappoints yet again. Man of Steel is not a terrible movie; but there is just nothing here to make it great. It will be easily forgettable.  Most characters are not particularly interesting and sorely lack weight or substance. Even Superman himself sees no problem indirectly killing hundreds of people for no reason. The physics of superhero movies don't need to be believable; but the motivations of their characters should be. And that just isn't always true here. If you love movies like this, then you will not have a bad time, but I can not really recommend it anyone. ~ C+"
"Apr 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"I saw this as part of a double feature at our local drive-in. I recently watched the director's cut of the 1978 film with Christopher Reeve, but still need to watch Superman II in which General Zod makes his first screen appearance. I was surprised by how much the beginning of this movie on Krypton and in Smallville resembled Richard Donner's film. It is as if Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer directly adapted Superman's origins from that '78 screenplay. The cast of that movie was thought to be fairly prestigious. With Crowe, Shannon, and others this flick has high caliber acting talent also. Crowe and Zurer as Jor-El and Lara are a bit more on equal footing. The liquid metal graphite that seems to be a major building block in Kryptonian technology looked cool. It reminded me of some Terminator 2 effects. The design of Krypton includes other creatures living along side the humanoids. Shannon as General Zod, Traue as Faora-Ul, and the other military insurgents stage a more violent coup than we saw in the earlier film. The Phantom Zone for the criminals is represented by a more traditional ship this time. And in a similar fashion baby Kal-El is sent rocketing to Earth in his pod. Next we see Clark Kent in his youth (Timberline and Sprayberry) confronting a wider variety of developing superpowers with guidance from Lane and Costner as Martha and Jonathan Kent. What this script does differently during this introduction is use a nonlinear timeline to jumpcut between a bearded incognito Clark (Cavill) picking up odd jobs on his way to the arctic, while still coping with not knowing where his powers come from, and his younger days. We meet Adams as Lois Lane, who is a much tougher and more resourceful investigative reporter. She tracks down the strange stories surrounding this alien wanderer. Fishburne as Perry White with Kelly and Buller as a couple other Daily Planet reporters again don't make much of an impact when the plot has bigger fish to fry. Eventually Zod and his followers find Kal-El and initiate their plan to seek revenge against the house of El and take over Earth. The U.S. military with Lennix as a General, Schiff as a scientist, and Meloni as a Colonel realize they can trust Lois and Superman to help defeat the invading Kryptonians. Many other reviewers have already said it, but the last act with Superman and Zod pounding each other and their surroundings to a pulp gets old. Zack Snyder loves explosions and destruction a bit too much. Thank you Superman for saving humanity, but could you really not be more careful to avoid damaging satellites in space, most of downtown Smallville, and hundreds of skyscrapers throughout Metropolis, not to mention those countless lives, while you have your little fist fight with the villain from your home world?! The torment he feels from the actions he's been forced to take are palpable though. Henry Cavill looks like Christopher Reeve at times. Clark doesn't join the staff of the Daily Planet until the very end. Lois knowingly welcomes him with a nice zinger. And I look forward to sequels of this Superman reboot."
"Apr 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,Great movie. Very well done. I didn't expect too much after the last one so this one surprised me.
"Apr 13, 2013",POSITIVE,with amazing action sequences and visual great man of steel has made me a fan of superman man of steel is a great comeback for this superhero who's last movie wasn't all that good and with Snyder directing this is probably one of the most exciting superhero movies I've seen
"Apr 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,It's a fun movie. The CGI can be a bit overwhelming in the last 30 Minutes.
"Apr 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"Liked it better than Batman, Spider-Man or Ironman."
"Apr 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"The best way to describe this movie is: ""Not your father's Superman!"" This movie is a great escape. I think that it leans away from past Superman adaptions in a way to really be it's own movie. The happy go lucky Big Blue Boyscout has been done to death. This is a darker vision, and I welcome the change."
"Apr 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"I was a bit skeptical going in after reading the reviews. Fortunately, I did not come away feeling let down at all. This is a good movie with solid acting and plenty of action. It is on the dark side which is a plus IMO. This really should not even be a surprise though."
"Apr 13, 2013",POSITIVE,Totally different from the older ones. Best one since superman 1978.
"Apr 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,This was better than returns....solid movie
"Apr 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I walked into the theater saying to myself, ""Nothing can be worse than Superman 3 and 4."" and walked out second guessing myself. It isn't the actor's fault that it was written horribly and was directed by an annoying wanna be of a director. Seriously, the the writing was so bad that the last 40 minutes of the movie is nothing but mediocre action scenes and the action scenes were so bad that I got bored within the first five minutes of them. There is literally no legitimate plot in the last hour and a half of the movie. The ONLY redeeming qualities of this movie were the actors. Russel Crowe did an amazing job, as did Amy Adams and the new guy who played Superman. The only major problem involving the actors was the chemistry between Adams and Cavil. Their ""love"" kinda felt rushed, awkward, and questionable considering they only have about five brief conversations within the entire film. Speaking of the new guy playing Superman, why didn't he have more dialogue in the movie? I'm pretty sure Cavil was spending more time screaming, fighting, and silently job hopping under false identities rather than having normal conversations as
Superman or Clark Kent. The saddest part of the whole movie, the part when I cried the most, was when I saw Christopher Nolan's name in the credits. It is sad that the visionary behind Inception and the Dark Knight Trilogy has this sorry excuse for a Superman movie under his belt. I had incredibly high hopes for this one and it just fell flat. This probably isn't the last time we will be seeing Superman hit the silver screen, but I hope that the next installment will be more engulfed in an entertaining, interesting  plot and  will ease up on the action scenes."
"Apr 13, 2013",POSITIVE,THE BEST ONE!  Saw it twice and plan on IMAX version too.
"Apr 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"so far the best superman of all the films that are out there, it does explain a lot, but its a good on that puts two movies into one film, compared to the original film it is a good movie to see"
"Apr 13, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Will someone please explain to me why filmmakers believe that the more they destroy in a film the better or at least more entertaining it will be? And why do they all seem determined to destroy New York or at least comic named versions of New York? Sadly, I walk away from finally seeing Man of Steel with very little enthusiasm. I was actually pulled into the beginning of this film. All of politics and war happening on Krypton were interesting to see and given a lot of weight considering how much it impacts Kal El. But, what really intrigued me was lost Clark, roaming to globe for answers. Sadly, he found them about 1/3 of the way through and quickly was flying around as Superman. What I really wanted, at least this first film to focus on, was that journey. Clark having to come to grips with who he was and how who he wants to be not who he is being forced to be. Zod and all the Krypton stuff could have been held off for later films, allowed us to get to know the character and believe in him as the icon and hero that Superman is supposed to be here on this planet. Instead, the filmmakers chose to forgo character development for brute force and aliens. I found myself distracted by the nonsensical destruction and violence. Zod vs Superman - two fairly indestructible forces collide and someone thought this would be a good idea? Somehow we are supposed to enjoy watching a grudge match between an immovable force and an unstoppable object. If you like lots of explosions and pointless fighting, this ones for you. I honestly don't mind violence as long as it makes sense and has reason for being. This film lacked motivation in the characters and those who designed them and brought them to life. This left me with no motivation to give it a good review."
"Apr 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Definitely does not deserve the slack it has been getting. I finally ventured to the movies three weeks later than expected. Before seeing the reviews I was expecting a deeply story-rich action adventure. After reading through the critic's views I expected one big fight scene. Now, after culminating my own opinion, I can give my impression. The movie had a well-developed story, not great but not bad either. The character development, for the most part, progressed thoroughly. There were a few key notes they missed on with some of the major development. As for the action, the first 45 minutes of this movie are insane. Not only were there so many explosions, there was the greatest presence of a storyline in the whole film. That does not mean it went completely down hill, but it does not live to the potential that the first act foreshadows. With a 250 million dollars budget, they sure did use every last cent. Every scene I kept thinking to myself, ""there goes another million."" This movie is easily the most explosive movie I have ever seen, literally. I would definitely recommend seeing it in theaters; however, if you are expecting a masterpiece, prepare to be disappointed."
"Apr 13, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome fun! From beginning to end!
"Apr 13, 2013",POSITIVE,"Overall, I enjoyed myself more than I thought I would considering many of the negative reviews. It's definitely choppy in plot areas, some of the acting seems 'slapped-on' & I experienced sensory-overload with so much going on all at once in some scenes, but the action & effects were top-notch... Redundant at times, but still top-notch nonetheless! Recommended!"
"Apr 13, 2013",POSITIVE,Finally a good Super man movie. I was going to ask that no further Superman movies be made after this one if it wasn't good.
"Apr 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Yes im another person who isnt a superman fan at all but  was pretty pleased  by this movie tho its not gonna make me want to go out and become a superman fan but i do feel that this film is try something a little different, i think michael shannon as the character general zod was probably my favourite i think he makes a pretty good bad guy in this ! I think its worth the watch weather you like superman or not."
"Apr 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,"loved that it was mostly about krypton and not villain of the week, but it lasted about 30 minutes too long, story wasn't tight."
"Apr 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,too dramatic.. but with epic battle
"Apr 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Epic is the word that best describes this movie !!
"Apr 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Zack Snyder gave me the Superman movie I've waited years for. Magnificent...a real treat for Superman fans.
"Apr 12, 2013",POSITIVE,best superman movie so far...great effects and story.
"Apr 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,I give it three stars because I think it could have been better. The characters didn't show special effects opon there self nor to there enemies. also what is this another repeat to the story for what? we want to see what continues from superman returns not a new sequel.
"Apr 12, 2013",POSITIVE,I loved it. Very action packed and lots of excitement. Highly recommend it!
"Apr 12, 2013",POSITIVE,fantastic superhero movie!
"Apr 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Joyless, overlong slog."
"Apr 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Great story! Amazing effects! Ok acting.
"Apr 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great movie, it explained what happened to Krypton, and the pain the parents suffered when sending their son away. Excellent action scenes, use of flashback, relationship of Clark and his Earth parents."
"Apr 12, 2013",POSITIVE,"Super...man...honostly very good...love effects, colour and sound"
"Apr 12, 2013",POSITIVE,This is a great new vision for Superman. Zach Snyder brings a much needed reboot to the the Man of Tomorrow. This is definitely a much more relatable character than Brian Singers imagination and is something to build a much desired franchise from. Thank you for giving us the Superman we deserve.
"Apr 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,I don't know whether to rate this as good or ok. If anything it's somewhere down the middle.
"Apr 12, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The exact same storyline of Superman II, mashed with the storyline of the last David Tennant Doctor Who episodes but not done anywhere near as well. And a whole heap of violence and destruction. Plus, the origin was changed!!!  Possibly the worst reboot of a superhero franchise."
"Apr 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"As directed by Zack Snyder, MOS is very impressive from a visual standpoint, and a competent enough reboot to be worthy of the Superman name. However, it fails to strike a chord emotionally, as constant, repetitive action scenes overshadow character and plot development. It's not written very well either- the final battle scene, nearly an hour long, felt extremely reminiscent to that of movies such as The Avengers, The Dark Knight Rises, and even Transformers: Dark of the Moon. It's not a terrible movie by any means, but, put in the simplest of terms, it could've and should've been much better"
"Apr 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Don't listen to any of these critics trashing this movie. It does start kind of slow but it definitely makes up for it later on. The character development could have been a little better but Christopher Nolan and Zach Snyder spent a lot of time trying to turn Superman into this mysterious character so they can't give too much away to enhance your feelings for him. The action and CGI is amazing and all of the actors did a fantastic job. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!
"Apr 12, 2013",POSITIVE,Looks Good! Even though with the switch of the main actor!
"Apr 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Not what I expected,,, it was nice but the movie was not excited. Iron man 3 was better."
"Apr 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,I fell asleep... I didn't mean to but what I did see was okay
"Apr 11, 2013",POSITIVE,"good acting, great action and special effects make for a fun summer blockbuster"
"Apr 11, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Every super-fan out there has been biting their nails hoping 'Man of Steel' could step out of the shadow from the 1978 Richard Donner classic without completely sucking eggs.

We got what we asked for. However,sequel potential and action aside , we didn't get much more than that.

The superman for the next generation brings in some new core shifts in our hero's character. Rather than innate 'good,' (helping cats out of trees) Snyder refocuses on Clark's identity as an outcast and the myth becomes about trust and faith.  Its a good solid step in the right direction considering what we've become as a society since 1978.   
With a priority on retelling Clark's alien heritage, we are taken though a series of flashbacks that begin on krypton and end in smallville, where dialoge is sparse and characters can develop smoldering looks but not much more.  Snyder's flashback frenzy in the first half of the movie, held Adams and Cavil captive.  The style is great visually, painting an epic sweep of time, showing some very well designed and downright cool scenes that showcase Kryptonian technology, but translates poorly for character development.  Good for comics...bad for movies.  Lois and Clark come together by chances laid out in convinient plot points rather than gravitating to each other, and that's where the ball is really dropped.  The theme of trust is used everywhere else but between Lois and Clark.  There is no skepticism, no questioning. no real banter.  There is a huge gap between Lois and Clark that hopefully gets fleshed out in later sequels.

Thankfully, when the action finally picks up again Snyder and Cavil flex with everything they've invested in the new blue suit. This is the action sequence every super-fanboy has been waiting for.  The last thirty minutes alone are worth seeing for the price of admission.  Is it worth the wait? yup.  Cavil does good job as Superman, and the mass scale of destruction finally illustrates the weight of a super fight.  Do cars get smashed ? yes.  do building fall? yes. do super-people tumble through a skyline killing hundreds along the way ? ye...what? Yes.  With a battle this 'real' the body count racks up like the score on a pinball machine.  This IS after all a superman for the here and now.  And wait till you see how the battle ends.  It's not your father's superman story.  Does all this violence change the scope of the story?  Does a superman who doesn't save every innocent person in harms way change who we are?  No. we changed HIM.   Like it or not this is our hero now.  

By the time the movie fades to black we are get a glimpse of how the Clark's confidence has develloped, and we see him in much lighter spirits.  The cloud around him is gone and metropolis is lit up with the beginning of a new chapter for Clark. Hopefully the sequel can carry over some of that light and shine it on HIM.  Cavil can play a great Superman, but pulling of a convincing Clark is a much harder job. and between the botched up flashbacks and quiet brooding, we really haven't seen enough of him to tell yet."
"Apr 11, 2013",POSITIVE,I give it four stars but I think really deserves a three and half. I love all the action it was awesome.  I did not like the way they did the storyline dont get me wrong the story was good. But I felt they could of done a better job of keeping the audience into it. Cavill was great selection as superman.  American or not
"Apr 11, 2013",POSITIVE,"Being a huge superman fan i was waiting for this film for a long time, a really good superman movie that delivers. I don't care about the reviews. Man of Steel is inspiring, action packed and mind blowing.  My only complaint is that the action is a bit too much, it becomes mind numbing. Hanz Zimmer score is fantastic and elevates the film to another level. Must see and must buy!"
"Apr 11, 2013",POSITIVE,"Excellent re-imagining of the franchise. Much better than the critics are giving it credit for! I see in this film the kind of promise that Nolan built with ""Batman Begins"". This is an awesome door opening franchise film with lots of depth and stellar acting!"
"Apr 11, 2013",POSITIVE,Is a great movie! Henry Cavill does an excellent job as superman! And the action scenes looks terrific on IMAX.
"Apr 11, 2013",NEGATIVE,The movie was very slow in the beginning.  It was inconsistent with the original story.  It did however have some amazing special effects.
"Apr 11, 2013",POSITIVE,Definitely must see movie of the year.
"Apr 11, 2013",POSITIVE,The jaw dropping superman we've always wanted
"Apr 11, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Truly breathtaking, Henry Cavill's portrayal of the low-life version if Clark Kent was admirable. General Zod's portrayal from Michael Shannon was absolutely exceptional!! However I do feel that there were too many pointless action scenes, and the film was in definitive blocks o plot and action rather than a melting pot of the two"
"Apr 11, 2013",POSITIVE,"'Man Of Steel' is definitely my movie of the summer. This CBM is full of insane and intense action scenes that it can makes others action sequences look a little underwhelming. That said, this movie may have been lacking a little in emotion. This film is well thought out, well acted and top that with incredible action, amazing CGI and great cinematography and score. I find this adaptation to be on par with the original Superman: The Movie and this is without a doubt Zack Snyder's best film to date, this is the Superman film I've been waiting for my whole life and I give this a perfect 5/5."
"Apr 10, 2013",POSITIVE,"Awesome, this movie cast was excellent on every level. Russel Crow is the best Jor-El and Henry was the best Superman compared tho any. Thanks to Wal-Mart for releasing movie early. this have families a chance to view a Blockbuster at a reasonable time. the story was well told and as my eldest stated"" this movie made her forget all other Superman movies. Once again this is a great movie. Go see it."
"Apr 10, 2013",POSITIVE,No big difference with IMAX version
"Apr 10, 2013",POSITIVE,"I saw Superman when I was 7.  I'm not a comic book nerd but off and on I have read comics and considered myself a fan of Superman my whole life.  This movie was Great.  Its hard to compete with something you saw when you were seven but this was leaps and bounds better than Returns.  Crowe killed it.  Loved Adams' take on Lane. KILLER Krypton back story.  Sold!

Its not for kids... but I could care less.  I thought this movie did a better job showing what would happen if ""gods"" fought than anything I'd ever seen."
"Apr 10, 2013",POSITIVE,"amazing movie, I have no idea why the critics are trying to give it a low rating. Man of Steel kicks avengers ass"
"Apr 10, 2013",POSITIVE,"I have yet to see any other Superman movies, but I've seen plenty of Superman tv series and I think this movie makes a great addition to the legend. The pace of the movie was a little off in bits, but I actually really liked that they weren't afraid to spend longer than average on the exposition. Henry Cavill is a great Clark Kent (hubba hubba), and all the other casting choices were great. There were also a wonderful about of humor and stupid puns."
"Apr 10, 2013",POSITIVE,"I know! Just 3 stars? Actually more like 3.5. The movie was greatly animated, intense, fun, and entertaining, but lacked the pull of a character intensity.  I wanted to really like Clark Kent and it never developed.   This is where the review comes from. 

Still go see it. It was fun!"
"Apr 10, 2013",NEGATIVE,"You know, I'm no Superman expert, but even I can tell that this movie is severely flawed and stupid. There are four reasons for that too. No.1: This movie tries to represent an American icon and wants to show him as a becon of hope, but all it does is build his own ego and gives Superman and the other cast little to no personality what so ever. No. 2: Kevin Costner (Yeah, I know it's Pa kent. But your not gonna call him that, your just gonna call him by the actor's name.) says that if he shows his powers to the world, people will hurt him. I can see and believe something like that in an X men movie where that would make much more sense, but he's fucking Superman! The people are gonna glorify him and respect him as a hero! So that makes zero sense. No.3: The die hard (and no real life) fanboys claim that this movie is supposed to be a realistic approach on Superman, which wouldn't be a bad thing except... Superman is entirely UNREALISITC! In fact, half of DC's roaster of heroes is unrealisitc now that I think about it. Jerry and Joe Shuster created this guy out of mythology and legends like Hercules, so how are they trying to make him realistic in this when even that's been done before too? I mean really think about it... How many people do you know came from another world and gain insane powers and fly? No one does that! At least in other (more smarter and more logical) movies their aware that this sort of thing is impossible, but at least they try and create some device of sorts to let them do it. And no 4: If Superman is supposed to be a symbol of hope and justice, then why the fuck is he letting INNOCENT PEOPLE DIE AND NOT CARING ABOUT IT?! Even when he does kill Zod (which if you ask me is bullshit) he never brings it up again and it doesn't affect him in anyway! Even when other superheroes have to make these decisions like murder, that has to be like a consequence that has to follow him for the rest of his life, but here, he doesn't give a shit at all, he acts like nothing happened at all! I'll bet if someone close to him died he wouldn't care, because he is really a hero without any flaws or any real weaknesses, thus rendering him completely boring and uninteresting! So that's just  about four reasons why this movie is shit. You don't have to agree with me but that's how I feel."
"Apr 10, 2013",NEUTRAL,Not that amazing as we hoped but was better than its last piece of crap Superman film.
"Apr 10, 2013",POSITIVE,This is exactly what I wanted out of this movie I loved every minute of this movie now I can see why people wouldn't like it but it to me was perfect and hope to god that they make another
"Apr 10, 2013",POSITIVE,Great version and very entertaining
"Apr 10, 2013",POSITIVE,just what you want from a superman movie - well worth a watch
"Apr 10, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome. The Superman that has been worth waiting for.
"Apr 10, 2013",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed the action in Man of Steel..it is possible to have too much...but it was to make up for Superman Returns lack thereof. The scale of the destruction was very satisfying.
"Apr 10, 2013",POSITIVE,pretty good.   slight deviation from original.
"Apr 10, 2013",POSITIVE,"""A good death is its own reward."" - Faora"
"Apr 9, 2013",POSITIVE,"I just came back from Man of Steel and it was everything that I could have asked for and more from a Superman film. The poor critiques from ""respected"" sources for this film are unjust and quite honestly exaggerated. No film is perfect, but I had a very hard time finding the faults that so many critics cited. It's sad that there are so many reviewers that have forgotten the wonder a great film can bring to an audience no matter the genre. Man of Steel has introduced young and old to this generations Superman and he is welcomed with open arms."
"Apr 9, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The first half is quite interesting, but after that the movie completely obliterates due to cheesy scripts and crappy acting. But the most pathetic part was the (WARNING SPOILER ALERT) when Zod get smashed through buildings and fire, then dies from getting his neck broken by superman, making this crap become the laughing stock of krypton."
"Apr 9, 2013",NEGATIVE,Biggest trailer awesomeness to film shitness difference that has ever existed. Only reason why I'm giving it two stars is for Hans Zimmer's awesome soundtrack.
"Apr 9, 2013",NEUTRAL,Was a great film. Puts the one prior to shame.
"Apr 9, 2013",POSITIVE,The movie was fantastic. Excellent story and great action. Superb special effects.
"Apr 9, 2013",POSITIVE,best dc comics movie since the dark knight
"Apr 9, 2013",POSITIVE,"While this film does have a few plot-holes that bother me (then again, what film doesn't have plot-holes?), I really enjoyed it. I have never really been a fan of Superman, I always preferred Batman and most Marvel characters, this film made me care more for him. I loved some of the performances in this film as well! Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe, all gave some of the best performances in a superhero movie I have ever seen! And this film does have a good shot at creating a DC Cinematic Universe, and a Justice League movie does seem pretty inevitable, so Marvel does certainly have competition as this may be the start of something awesome! Looking forwards to seeing where this goes!"
"Apr 9, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Not what I expected. Lengthy fight scenes, not very engaging. Not much influence from Nolan."
"Apr 9, 2013",POSITIVE,"No one seems to understand this Superman is going to grow as a character.  He will become that perfect hero we look up to one day, but like in life, it takes time. He's 33 from Kansas, not a 90 year old shaman."
"Apr 9, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome movie lots of action action
"Apr 9, 2013",POSITIVE,I really liked this movie.
"Apr 9, 2013",POSITIVE,absolutely exceeded my expectations for another remake of great movie!!
"Apr 9, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie delivers what we as Superman fans have been waiting to see. If Clark were real this is how it would have been for him. As far as the over the top destruction. Are you telling me that these people with the powers they possess are going to limit destruction to a few manhole covers, some cars a bus and a coke sigh? I don't think so. 
  Man of Steel is an amazing film. I recommend it only so you the fans can make your own judgment. However I promise you'll enjoy it. My only con about the film is its length. 25-30 shorter would have been perfect!"
"Apr 9, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie. Hope to see more Man of Steel in the future and soon.
"Apr 9, 2013",NEUTRAL,the fight scenes are epic if not way over the top...but it is superman. The movie itself felt rushed even though it was a long enough movie as is.
"Apr 9, 2013",POSITIVE,"MIND BLOWING ACTION SEQUENCES, WOW!!!!"
"Apr 9, 2013",POSITIVE,"The quality of the Superman movies seemed to dip and rise in outlandish directions. Superman: The movie was very good, Superman 2 was also great, Superman 3 was not as good, Superman 4 was abysmal and Superman Returns was forgettable and bland. So DC and WB decided to reboot the franchise.

The story begins on Planet Krypton. The planet is on the brink of total destruction with the Kryptonians constantly mining the planet hollow. Jor El and his wife decide to have the first natural birth in years and send the baby to Earth in hopes that he can take the Kryptonian legacy with him and bring hope elsewhere. Meanwhile, a Kryptonian Warlord, General Zod and his cronies are sentenced to stay in the phantom zone.

Kal El, the son of Jor El is adopted by Johnathon Kent and his  wife and they raise him as Clark Kent but are aware of his powers. Clark grows up trying to live with his powers until he finds an old Kryptonian vessel at the North Pole and finds his purpose in life.

All hell breaks loose when Kal El sends a distress signal into space by accident. This attracts the attention of General Zod who manages to escape the phantom zone and finds Kal El on Earth. He wants to find the codex of the Kryptonian species in his vessel so he can turn Earth into new Krypton. It is now up to Superman to save the world from being taken over.

This movie is epic! It's my favourite Superhero movie yet! It makes changes to the franchise but stays true to the comics and while the movie has heart  and meaning, it also has all the action you'd expect from a summer blockbuster and then some. It is very generous with the Superman action sequences.

The first 20 minutes of the movie are spent on Krypton as it comes to it's end, the next 40 minutes are spent on Earth developing the characters and seeing Clark growing up in a series of flashbacks. This keeps the story fresh and tells a new chapter with every flashback. The last hour and a half are just pure blockbuster action with Superman vs General Zod and his cronies. It is very exciting! I recommend it to any Blockbuster, Sci Fi, Superhero fan and if you're not into this kind of thing, this movie could probably change your mind. Get out and go see it!"
"Apr 9, 2013",POSITIVE,This is the FOR REAL-FOR REAL SUPERMAN MOVIE...  A must see
"Apr 8, 2013",POSITIVE,Man of Steel soars high with it's impressive visuals and thrilling origin story for one the most beloved superheroes in past the century. While it's not perfect -  it doesn't quite hit every emotional punch it throws -  Man of Steel is still high quality entertainment for the masses that has more style over substance.
"Apr 8, 2013",POSITIVE,"BeZ SuPerMan Movi3 EvEr!!! ItS Now TiME 4 ThE ""Justice Leage"" 2 TaKE The BiG ScrEEn!!!"
"Apr 8, 2013",POSITIVE,"Taking a play from the Dark Knight trilogy, this movie isn't as good as any of those movies, but leaves enough doors open to build on for future films."
"Apr 8, 2013",NEGATIVE,could have been better
"Apr 8, 2013",POSITIVE,"Superman returns...again, but this time he punches people. Man of Steel is a bombastic reboot with lots of spectacular imagery, some terrific performances, and a masterful score by Hans Zimmer. It is more than successful enough to reignite the superman franchise, even if it is a little empty-headed at moments."
"Apr 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Looking forward to this, sort of."
"Apr 8, 2013",POSITIVE,"A stunning, action packed reboot! Man of Steel may not have as much humor as the Chris Reeve version but it is a very necessary reboot that confirms Cavill as the perfect choice. Zack Snyder handles the action thumpingly well and the visuals breathtakingly magnificent!"
"Apr 8, 2013",POSITIVE,"This was exciting. I saw this at midnight in a packed room, and I think I speak for everyone when I say we loved it. The action was epic, the story was okay, the acting was spot on, and I really liked how the movie felt."
"Apr 8, 2013",NEGATIVE,Not terrible but not great
"Apr 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Spectacular in action sequence but minus in character development. This Superman is far away from Nolan's type of film, it's more like Zack Snyder's. He  wanted to make this movie not boring, so he made the background of Clark Kent character just in quick flashback. That is a very wrong decision. But above all of that weaknesses, this film suceed to win the heart from the audience. About 45-60 minutes full action with a little dialog made me feel this might be the biggest destruction movie that have ever made. I suddenly think that this year Iron Man is just a  kinderarten action sequence compare to this. Man of Steel maybe is not better than I expected but it really worth every single money spent for a ticket. I reccomended to watch this not in 3D version or Imax, although I admit it the sound of Hans Zimmer score trully masterpiece in Imax audio."
"Apr 8, 2013",POSITIVE,VERY VERY VERY WOOOW
"Apr 7, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great movie, a must go see!!!"
"Mar 26, 2013",NEUTRAL,enjoyable! liked seeing more of krypton but couldn't take my eyes of supermans teeth :-)
"Mar 26, 2013",POSITIVE,"A far cry from the painfully dull Superman Returns, Man Of Steel provided viewers with amazing action sequences and a well executed origin story. The lack of character development is noticeable, but it doesn't hurt the film in any way."
"Mar 26, 2013",POSITIVE,Gotta be awesome!!!!
"Mar 26, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superhero movie I've seen!!!
"Mar 26, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great superman origin film, finally the superman that fans deserve, he punches and breaks things!!! lol, Very strong performances by all, especially costner and crowe. Henry Cavill fully embodies superman/kal-el/clark kent, great movie, cant wait to go again."
"Mar 26, 2013",NEUTRAL,"strong visuals good cast kind  of split in half, surprisingly sci fi ... act@ion to o video game like and destruction override d the climatic plot"
"Mar 25, 2013",POSITIVE,excellent action movie!
"Mar 25, 2013",POSITIVE,really awesome movie to me the best movie of the summer :)
"Mar 25, 2013",POSITIVE,awesome movie. best superman movie since the orginal although the orginal will always be better. please DC and warner bros. start pumping out more movies so we cam have a justice league movie soon
"Mar 25, 2013",POSITIVE,"In what way is ""Thor The Dark World"" better than this?"
"Mar 25, 2013",POSITIVE,I like all of the man of steel movies. But by far this one was the good one.
"Mar 25, 2013",POSITIVE,movie is awsome..little slow at times..but then tons of action too!
"Mar 25, 2013",POSITIVE,"I think it's an excellent Superman movie with welcome tweaks to the existing mythos, but the nearly endless action sequences felt like overkill."
"Mar 25, 2013",NEGATIVE,Destruction porn and carelessly tossing around Clark/Kal-El endeavors does not constitute a memorable superhero movie.
"Mar 25, 2013",POSITIVE,Love the re-make! Can't wait for the next one!
"Mar 25, 2013",POSITIVE,"I will need further study of this film to really grasp all of its parts, but I think it was a drastic improvement on the last attempt at a film in this franchise. It also gave me just enough of an origin for a character this ubiquitous. However, I did have troubles with the pace of the action of the film given what we already know of Kal-El and the teachings of Jonathan Kent."
"Mar 25, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This Origin story of the consummate super-hero slowly drifts towards the stupidity of invulnerable combat. Fortunately, the staggering runtime is still not long enough to embody somebody's dumb idea on how to ruin this movie that is far more interesting to start with than how it finishes. This was especially true for me, someone who was never interested in superman, and who therefore knew nothing about his background. I enjoyed the look, feel, and story of Krypton, Superman's meaning to his extinct people, and him earnestly trying to find a place while he blends in. However, when Superman finally takes action, it becomes anything but fascinating. It actually becomes frustrating as we watch brutal combat between superhumans that is completely inconsequential- so long as you're not counting the buildings they level. The editing also slips up, as the film now must juggle between some unsatisfying, fast-paced action and the shreds of story left over. If I were to speculate, I'd say that the Nolan brothers walked away at the 115 minute mark and Zack Snyder took over from there. That being the case, you could skip to the final scenes because you won't miss a single plot twist, storytelling element, or pivotal development of any sort. This is all a sad letdown to the excellent cast and characters. The ending of a movie should be the culmination of a story. It should be the thing that sums it all up or makes sense of it all. Instead, it's just a pointless battle that barely pans out and ends with someone eventually, equivocally, and essentially breaking character."
"Mar 25, 2013",POSITIVE,Good for an origin story. Good setup for Luthor to be justifiable in his hatred for superman and to further test the humanity of the man of steel.
"Mar 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,first 2/3 good then a never ending cgi orgy
"Mar 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Parts of it I really liked and others not as much, but at the end I walked away feeling satisfied overall."
"Mar 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"Just like the rest of Zack Snyder's films, this will not be for everyone. But for those that enjoy and appreciate dark, graphic novel type movies, it is a very good movie. If you were reading a Superman graphic novel, this is what you would imagine in your head. I really enjoyed it."
"Mar 24, 2013",POSITIVE,It is the best and I can't wait to see it so I have a man of steel toy
"Mar 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,I enjoyed much of the movie. Wish there was a little more laughing and less tall buildings getting knocked down.
"Mar 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I'm so conflicted with this movie. Every time I watch it I have a different opinion about it. Some of the themes and stories in this flick are wildly inconsistent, and the directing and editing can be sporadic and contrived. Some of the characters at CERTAIN TIMES feel lifeless, and the first and second halves of the movie feel unbalanced and wildly different. The first half is obviously superior in terms of themes, character development, tone, and even visuals. Maybe they could have done a better job in terms of acting for some of the characters, but overall the first half REAAAALLY works. It feels like the definitive dark take on superman's origin story. Problem is, by the time we get into the second half, it feels like we've jumped in to a sequel to man of steel rather than the conclusion of a first chapter. The themes of hope, destiny, and self-discovery, and the well drawn-out character development seem to have been shed in place of awesome action and exposition, which would be great for superman, but not THIS movie. Clark became superman all of a sudden. Without any warning, it made little sense. You could say that the plot of the first half leads itself into the second half, but the problem is, concluding the conflict of the story halfway through the film is sloppy and leaves the audience going ""..huh?"" And that's what happened to me. I seriously felt like I was watching another movie, and I was disappointed by the lackluster conclusion to the awesome conflict I'd been watching for the past hour. I wish there had been more of a well constructed story that would have gone over the whole movie, I would have enjoyed it more. These are just MY problems that I PERSONALLY had watching the movie. It's entertaining for the most part, so that bumps up my score a bit. Also, what's up with the darkness? This is superman, not batman, you can make it a little bit happy. Why did half the population if metropolis have to die? Why couldn't superman put a little bit of effort into saving people rather than getting the extra punch in Zod? This movie feels like the script writer was trying to craft an interesting character based movie but then gave into the fanboys for the second half. It makes. No. Sense. It's possible to have a movie with earth-shattering action, and inject some joy into it... And also craft a story that makes sense. But overall, I like what they were trying to do with this. But for all it's flaws, I'll give the movie this: Henry Cavill is a perfect superman. Well done with the casting in this movie. 
5 out of 10"
"Mar 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It was kinda meh. The action was spectacular, but the pace was to inconsistent (poor editing), slow when the scenes were important and way to fast were the could have been ""moments"". The acting was sub par, especially Amy Adams (no offense Mrs Adams) and Michael Shannon (some offense meant). The best actor was Henry Cavill which was surprising. There is one thing that I absolutely HATED, and it is pretty obvious when you see the film. It kind of breaks the whole superman story. Anyways, it's worth seeing once not multiple times."
"Mar 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"Had it not been for the magic of Christopher Reeve in the original ""Superman: The Movie"" film, this would easily take 1st place in the superheroes line of movies made. It is most definitely one of the best origin stories told in the superhero universe, and you can definitely tell that Christopher Nolan had his hand in production, where as younger that sense of ""Batman Begins"" in ""Man of Steel."" Seeing the beginning of Kal-El, and his world is something that missed mostly all the previous films, and it was great to see it, it helped give you a feel for his people, and more importantly, General Zod's feelings and purpose of life in his eyes. So, the storyline is great, and if you've read my reviews, I don't tell you a lot, because I like the viewer to see it for themselves. I'll just say its an excellent origin story, with many scenes of jumping from past to present. Now the acting, which was also superb, not corny, not silly, just all around great. Not to mention a star studded cast. In my opinion, the best performances were from Russell Crowe as Jordan-El, Michael Shannon as General Zod, and Amy Adams as Lois Lane. Don't worry, Henry Cavill definitely held his own as the lead, these three just impressed me a bit more. Now the action, which was intense, and the most intense out of any Superman movie. Long, gritty, and devastating action sequences, not to mention the entire last 45 minutes is complete chaos. Overall, a great film, and the blockbuster that Superman deserved, as well as DC Comics. If you go into this film, and walk out unhappy, I truly believe that you have no idea what a great origin story really is. It's that good. 4.5/5 JD"
"Mar 24, 2013",POSITIVE,"best film ever ,really loved it"
"Mar 23, 2013",POSITIVE,Really liked this reboot.  They did a great job with his history in flashbacks and worked so well.
"Mar 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,As good as superman can possibly be.
"Mar 23, 2013",POSITIVE,It's a epic movie. The superman movie we all have been waiting for.
"Mar 23, 2013",POSITIVE,See this in 3d xd. It's worth it
"Mar 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Good in all production manners, but the fundamental story lacks surprise and originality."
"Mar 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Decent enough.  Kinda a shame when Superman is the least interesting character, though ...."
"Mar 23, 2013",POSITIVE,Awesome...... a new view of superman
"Mar 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies I've ever seen, loved it!!!"
"Mar 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"Christopher Nolan has done it again. Some nit picky things I didn't like, but overall this movie was fantastic and real. Really pierced your soul!!!! :S"
"Mar 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,Save the date anak :)
"Mar 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"unreal action, average everything else, awesome explanation of superman's powers"
"Mar 23, 2013",POSITIVE,Good movie! I had a great time watching it! It is what it is but I'm loving this new Superman!!!
"Mar 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Overall, not bad.  The ending fight scenes get a little repetitive.  It wasn't as bad as I was expecting it to be, however."
"Mar 23, 2013",POSITIVE,A bit slow but enjoyable
"Mar 22, 2013",NEGATIVE,Kiss my ass on this one. Smh
"Mar 22, 2013",POSITIVE,"The movie is simply perfect; the ""slow"" Snyder's signature isn't so present in the film... The performances are good, but there are a few apparitions of Amy Adams that I can't explain why are there. The story is just of the world of superman and almost it not make references to another heroes of ""justice league"", isn't a commercial for future films. The 3D effects are superb and in certain scenes they are so good.
The story about Clark Kent is showed in small scenes; but they aren't the most important events in the hero's story, but also are interesting that moments and the emotions in these. There are not kryptonite but Snyder shows other weakness for the hero (his interest for Louis Lane and his own morality about the murder for his enemies). Isn't the best Hero's movie; many people complain about the duration of the film, and yes it's long but is just the necessary, there are scenes without meaning but there aren't so many like other films... But the story and mainly Snyder's work and Cavill's performance is correctly done."
"Mar 22, 2013",POSITIVE,Film of the year!!!!!!
"Mar 22, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Much of this film is very good, albeit quite bleak, telling the early story of Superman in flashback until the final third when special effects, action & complete mayhem take over as 2 superhuman, indestructible beings slog it out razing half of the city of Metropolis to the ground (at times it's like watching Neo fight Agent Smith in the final Matrix film). It's pity because if the director had been more restrained on the action & special effects & adhered to a 'less is more' philosophy it would have significantly more enjoyable. It would also have been a more palatable 20 - 30 mins shorter than the bum-numbing 2.5 hours it ended up being. The extra length added nothing to the story. Hopefully the next installment will remedy these mistakes much like 'The Dark Knight' massively improved on 'Batman Begins'."
"Mar 22, 2013",POSITIVE,"It would be so easy to sit here and tell you that this film is just a CGI'd, special effects extravaganza that seems to forget to introduce us to the characters, but that would be lying, yes it is all of those things, but one thing it is not is a poor film. Most of the people who'll watch this film will have already seen the 1978 version of the Man Of Steel, if we had seen big long introductions and huge elements of character development in the film, critics would have complained it focus' too much on characters rather than action (just like Superman Returns) but when it's the other way around they still complain. I'm a huge Superman fan and my expectations of this movie were muted, I wasn't looking forward to seeing Zack Snyder (a director who has failed to make a movie I've actually enjoyed) direct this reboot I was very skeptical. I also hated the look of the suit and from the first promo image I didn't think Henry Cavill fit the bill, all of my doubts were gone by the end credits and I knew that I had finally seen a great modern Superman movie. Cavill totally proved me wrong and while I'm still not a fan of Snyder he's won some brownie points with me with Man Of Steel. Yes it is totally special effects heavy but in this generation how many superhero movies have you seen that isn't a CGI heavy film? Not many, the fight scenes were totally epic and in a dark turning point for the Man Of Steel at the end we see the moment he ceases to be Clark Kent and becomes Superman, and Clark Kent is only a disguise. Without giving anything away it's certainly not something we see Superman do too often, but needs must and it was a very good ending. 

Hands down this is a five star film for me, and I can't decide if I like this or the original Superman better, they're both amazing in their own right, and this is definitely now one of my all time favourite movies."
"Mar 22, 2013",POSITIVE,watched man of steel and i love the movie so much i watched it twice. my opinion on the movie is that it is so magnificent and that this is thee superman movie we've all been wanting to see for years
"Mar 22, 2013",POSITIVE,"It's neither great, nor is it terrible, Nolan, Goyer and Snyder's take on rebooting Superman on the big screen is mostly successful, even if it falls into generic Blockbuster territory in the 3rd act, the problems in the film is that they are trying to reboot Superman in a grounded reality and treat him seriously, it's looks like they don't understand that serious dosent mean dark, Superman shouldn't be treated in the same way Batman was reinvented as Batman is and always be a symbol of angst, Superman is always a symbol of hope, and the films screenwriter did admit that just because that Superman was treated seriously, dosent mean he's treated as a dark character as the grounded reality depicted in the reboot is a dark and gritty setting and the character was again a symbol of hope to the people in the grim reality, there less humour than there was in the earlier interpretation of Superman, but Cavil's take as the Man of Steel, you don't have that, at least for almost the rest of the film, what Cavil did with that character is that Kal-El is an outcast in the gritty reality trying find out who he is, where did he come from? Cavil's performance as Clark Kent/Superman is okay in some level as his role as the title character is less humourus that Reeve's take on Superman, which is considered by people the best take on the character on the big screen, but Cavil's Superman is role his own, this take on Superman addressed his limitations that wasn't addressed proper in the original Superman films, for example and this is not a plot spoiler as it was addressed in the comics that Superman in his early years couldn't fly and it is portrayed right up there in Zack Snyder's film, which he got rid of all his filmmaking techs for this reboot, which is okay, but not brilliant as he couldn't get the sci-fi/reality balance right, especially in the 3rd act, which was heavily criticised by film critics, many film critics were divided when Christopher Nolan picked Zack Snyder to direct Man of Steel, giving that his last film nearly led to believe that he was not right for the film that Nolan and Goyer were trying to take, also he prefers style over substance, as established in his earlier films, but really Nolan picked Snyder due to his stylised take on comic book adaptation (300) and his understanding of stripping superheroes down (Watchmen, which Mark Kermode stated that Zack Snyder is in the end, not Christopher Nolan, citing that the Dark Knight is not the comic-book masterpiece everybody else thinks it is and sorry Mr Kermode, The Dark Knight is the best comic-book ever made and Zack Snyder is in the end, Christopher Nolan due to his take on Watchmen, which I do have to agree for the Good Doctor on that, though I haven't fully seen the film itself due to it's 18 cert, which was critisised for divided reasons, so it's technically the Good Doctor's fault for this in my opinion) and Zack Snyder did his best at making the best Superman that he could make for a modern audiences, c'mon critics, for goodness sake, this Superman film need more action which was lost in Superman Returns, which I think is an okay Superman film, no one wants to watch critically acclaimed films coz if they do, they should watch it when it comes out on DVD, as movies like Man of Steel are made for every moviegoers around the world to enjoy in cinemas, regardless if it falls into generic blockbusters territory, we all live in a gritty reality and this is the right time for Superman to soar on our cinemas as this year marks 75 years of the Man of Steel"
"Mar 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I wasn't impressed and the movie was not good enough.
Clark didn't even showed off when he was young. in fact, he was already adult when he arrived on earth and that was no fun. I did not see want I wanted to see in this movie, were he would get bullied in his kid and teen life, and were he would show off. I want to see him save other kids that gets bully from bad guys. I want to see were he would save lives in his kid and teen life. Thats what the superman should be, that's his role. He did save the bus, save the people on the sea and that was it, and it was only flashed back and it sucks. I want to see him in highschool with unnatural power. And show off."
"Mar 21, 2013",POSITIVE,Can't wait to see it
"Mar 21, 2013",POSITIVE,"Best movie of the summer!  It's not a perfect movie, but as an action movie it is awesome.  Way better than iron man.  I only wish they would have incorporated the old theme song from the Christopher Reeves era movies at some point, but I understand they want to do their own thing."
"Mar 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,"While excellently cast, Man of Steel has too much action and not enough story to back it up.  While Iron Man was a brilliant, soaring start to the Marvel movie universe, Man of Steel is DC barely getting off the ground at all."
"Mar 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,Perry White has an earring.
"Mar 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This movie a enjoyable overall and I like a lot of subtle characteristics they added to Superman.  However, the movie goes a little over-the-top and you don't feel that Superman really grasps how much death and deconstruction he and the other Kryptonians cause in the movies many battles.  A decent start to the a new franchise and I am looking forward to further installments."
"Mar 21, 2013",NEGATIVE,"While the acting was solid from a well chosen cast and the sfx outstanding, I felt this story to be too dark for my taste. Instead of Superman being an example we should aspire to emulate, he was made to be too flawed and confused."
"Mar 20, 2013",POSITIVE,"An impressively fresh take on the Superman mythos with excellent special effects and solid performances all around.  Still, this movie definitely isn't for those who are overly-enamored with the Christopher Reeve original, as it focuses heavily on Superman and little on Clark Kent."
"Mar 20, 2013",POSITIVE,There some gripes but it doesn't take away any justice from this spectacle that makes this icon a cinema grandeour.
"Mar 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,This superman fails to inspire hope but succeeds in inspiring how to look good and have a great smile even in the worst situation. Christopher Reeves still wins.
"Mar 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Man of Steel is a divisive film. It will entirely depend on where you stand in regards to Superman. If you're a fan of the perfect, Christopher Reeves era superman. One who knows exactly what to do. Then you'll probably be disappointed with this Superman. Much like Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy it seems like this superman's journey is going to be about the Man of Steel discovering what it means to be Superman. What that symbol means to others. Superman can't start out perfect. Otherwise there's no arc. The spectacle of this film is unmatched. Although, excessive. The editing is strong. The acting is great. Amy Adams makes a perfect Lois Lane. There's a strong female presence throughout the movie which was very refreshing for a film like this (The only person objectified in this movie is superman, something unexpected in a superhero film). But it's Hans Zimmer's score that elevates this film. One of the best scores I've heard in while. The problems with this film mostly lie in the script. Bad dialogue, missed opportunities. Man of Steel is a flawed film. But it works much more often than it doesn't."
"Mar 20, 2013",POSITIVE,best super hero action movie ever!
"Mar 20, 2013",POSITIVE,Best movie of the summer!
"Mar 20, 2013",POSITIVE,"It's easy to see why so many didn't enjoy this film.  The action is a mess, the storyline jumps between not only generations but galaxies as well, plus it demands a lot of patience with its lengthy duration.  However it's also easy to see that they have laid the groundwork for some excellent storytelling with the coming films."
"Mar 20, 2013",NEGATIVE,Worst Superman movie ever! Plot was weak! Acting even worst! The best part of the movie was the last 20 minutes. You keep watching the movie hoping that it's going to get better it never really do! I almost felt embarrass for the actor playing Superman because that is how bad the movie really is!
"Mar 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Aaa finally I saw that! Only one thing, this supermen is so HOT!"
"Mar 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,"phenomenal action just like the animations, but the story was rushed had no buildups to the scenes. overall a satisfactory movie. Definitely worth a watch."
"Mar 20, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie is a masterpiece. The detail is amazing in every frame of every scene. Zack Snyder crafted a wonderful revision of the Superman story and world while keeping important key story points and characters and tweaking a few things. Ive read some reviews that Lois and characters like Perry White weren't in this movie enough and I must say to those reviews WHO CARES THE MOVIE IS ABOUT SUPERMAN. Hence the title MAN OF STEEL. Amy Adams was great in her role and im sure she will be in the next movie alot more. Henry Cavill did a wonderful job portraying Clark/Superman the suit made the man and the man made the suit. Michael Shannon as always did a great acting and a nice spin on Zod. Bravo the all the cast and crew. The acting was great. The action was top notch. I will buy this on Blu-Ray and wait to buy my tickets to the sequel. Go see this movie and dont try to compare it to previous Superman movies because its not like them its a re crafted work of art for the 21st century.
"Mar 20, 2013",POSITIVE,amazing movie will definitely pre order at best buy. I recommended everyone this movie
"Mar 19, 2013",POSITIVE,"Best movie so far in 2013
No doubt"
"Mar 19, 2013",POSITIVE,"Henry Cavill IS Superman!  The visual style and emotional impact this story had on me far outweighed the at times too heavy CGI battles.  The Superman one on one battles are SENSATIONAL!  The one shots of Cavill as Superman are as if Superman has stepped off the page and into our lives.  Amy Adams was a spunky and whip smart Lois Lane.  ZOD, played by Michael Shannon, who I had the pleasure of working with on Revolutionary Road, was alien in his delivery and it worked.  The issues I had with the movie, the things that made me kind of tilt my head a bit, are far far outmatched by the impact the movie had on my soul.  The future of movie stars is in town, and his name is Henry Cavill."
"Mar 19, 2013",POSITIVE,"Loved this movie, story old Superman 2 with a little extra, but after Superman Returns a home run. Will be waiting on a new one however with original material."
"Mar 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be but I'm very surprised it's rotten. How can the twentieth Fast and Furious movie be fresh while this is rotten? It makes question my faith in humanity.

It definitely suffered from Snyder's directing abilities (stupid zoom-ins and the painfully obvious Jesus parallels) and Goyer's writing (Pa Kent's death and the dragged out Krypton scenes). 

I really wonder how involved Nolan was in this film, or if he was involved at all, because there is only one picture of him on set and he wouldn't have green lighted the stained-glass Jesus/Superman scene, the space crucifix scene, nor the Pa Kent death scene. If Nolan would have directed and wrote this with his brother it would have been much better.

Outside of Lawrence Fishburne's Perry White, the acting was average to just plain wooden. Henry Cavill definitely looked the part of Superman but he left much to be desired and Amy Adams wasn't a great Lois Lane. The action was top notch though, but it came at expense of the story which is the most important part of any film.

Summary: Man of Steel's struggle to define its self as a popcorn flic or film is what kept if from achieving greatness. 
6.9/10 or 2.5/4 stars or 3/5 stars"
"Mar 19, 2013",POSITIVE,very good worth watching defo !!!
"Mar 19, 2013",POSITIVE,"Effects were amazing, the storyline was...ok, could have been better."
"Mar 19, 2013",POSITIVE,one of the best superhero movies ever made
"Mar 19, 2013",POSITIVE,Loved the effects and storyline.
"Mar 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Man of Steel was a wow factor movie. I love when they stick to the original comic. Amazing action and a perfect backstory finally shown on film.
"Mar 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"Overall a fun movie, but I hated how Jonathan Kent was portrayed. Nothing beats Smallville!"
"Mar 18, 2013",NEGATIVE,oh god this was awful.
"Mar 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"Great superman, love the darkness. It reflects the time that we are in."
"Mar 18, 2013",POSITIVE,A bit of a slow start to it. But once it gets going it doesn't stop
"Mar 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Amazing reinterpretation of a story we thought we all knew... and not just because I worked on the production. Look for Sears in MAN OF STEEL!
"Mar 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"I went into this movie expecting something along the lines of the Donner films just a little less campy but those expectations were not met at all. I decided to give this film a second viewing with much different expectations. I even thought I was going to hate it more but to my surprise I loved it more the second time and even more the third viewing. I think the problem most critics and fans had was that unlike the Donner films we never got a fully formed Superman, which I love. This movie is a grittier take on the world's greatest superhero and it shows his first step to earning that title. Man of steel is a very good almost great superhero origin tale and I can't  wait to sequel set up by this universe."
"Mar 18, 2013",POSITIVE,Great action and I felt like the actors did their characters justice. Loved it from start to finish!
"Mar 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel (2013) Review by Kean Hooi Teh

Many of you have come to know Superman since you were young and unless you have read its comic or watch its animation before, you will feel that Zack Synder's Man of Steel is a little bit different. It's different in a good way of course. It's not just a reboot or remake of the original Superman but more of an in-depth character study about Clark Kent and his alter ego, our ever helpful Superman.

""Smallville"", ""Metropolis"" and ""Daily Planet"", these are the proper nouns that most of you should be familiar with. Yes, they are the key locations in the comic that's been featured in the film. I have one thing to confess here. After watching the first teaser trailer since last August, I've been in love with this reboot of such a long running series. It has definitely gained my affection. So, I might be quite biased but if it's good, audiences will see that it is. 
There have been a total of five Hollywood motion picture, from Superman in 1978 to Superman Returns in 2006. Christopher Nolan dared to take up the challenge and started this project to revive Superman to the motion picture and putting Zack Snyder as the director, I have no slight complaint at all.

Ever since I've watched the first official trailer this April, I've been wondering how Zack is going to direct this reboot. How is he going to introduce this character? How is he going to tell his story and show us the growth and maturity of Kal-El, who is commonly known as Clark Kent or Superman. Surprisingly, he did it with a familiar technique, called flashback, and it's terrifically done. I'm very happy to see how everything turned out. The plot progresses in a moderate and good pace. There isn't a scene that was felt unnecessary in the film and nothing has been overly illustrated or prolonged. The first one and a half hour is the gem of the entire film in my opinion. Some might feel that it's slow and somehow dull but it's what made a superhero story great, the part where they discover their abilities and growing into a true hero.

Let me share with you more elements of the film while keeping spoilers to the minimum. Krypton, as you know is the birth place and planet where Kal is born. It's a dying planet but I'd have to say, it's depicted as being far more technologically advanced than ours and having a civilisation more ancient and established than ours as well. Those scenes at the beginning of the film are quite similar to what we usually see in those sci-fi films like Avatar and Star Wars. During the early age of Kal, his earthly parents taught him to control and master his unusual abilities that made him different from the other kids. For a person with such great power, he has to learn how to control and put them to use for greater good. Is he truly capable of greater good and can he help us achieve wonders? We shall see.

No doubt, this is a superhero movie so there's bound to be some or a lot of action sequences. There's a lot of it in the second half of the film and it got a little bit too noisy. Seeing the scale of the destruction across Smallville and Metropolis, I'm amazed, but not impressed. If you are to destroy half of Metropolis in a fight like this, how will it be when he's facing a greater enemy in the Justice League? Will there even be an Earth left to fight on? The battle scenes towards the end were a bit too much, but if you're looking for some great action at the end, it's there and it's epic. Try to think of it as the Transformer, maybe you'll understand what I'm trying to leak to you.

Now comes our main character, Henry Cavill is Clark Kent/Kal-El. He has surely trained himself well to don the red cape. With all the well developed muscle on him, this new Superman looks really fit and smart. His character stayed quite true to the Superman from the comic as his superpower came from harnessing the solar energy from our Sun. Our leading actress, Amy Adams plays the ever daring and front line reporting legend, Lois Lane. Her character is well played and compelling. Whenever there is action or mysteries, she will be there. I thought Jimmy would be there to hold the camera but he wasn't and instead, Miss Lane was doing everything by herself. She's a persistent one, isn't she?

Russell Crowe played the righteous Jor-El and Kal's father while Ayelet Zurer played as Kal's mum Lara Lor-Van. They showed us that all their hope were placed on their only son, Kal-El and they believed that he has the freedom to choose the path he wants. On Earth, Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are Jonathan and Martha Kent respectively. They named Kal Clark and brought him up to become a righteous and well behaved person. Although for most of the time, what his parents said to Clark might sound clich√©d, but those words are very reassuring and comfortable to hear as they're meaningful teaching to a young one. Perry White, as played by Laurence Fishburne wasn't playing much of role but he wasn't a coward when it comes to times where people's lives were at stake. Also, he's as eager as Miss Lane when it came to unravelling the truth behind the mystery man as well.

What about the villain? General Zod as played by Michael Shannon was a kind of accurate portrayal from the Zod we've seen in the comic. He's born to be a warrior and his sole purpose is to fight. So fight he will to make sure that his people don't perish but prosper till eternity. His motive and purpose drives him towards Earth. His sub-commander, Faora-Ul as played by Antje Traue was quite a fighter too. Her lack of sense of morality made her being relentless in combat.

When it comes to the soundtrack in the film, Hans Zimmer brilliant score never disappoints and sets you right in the moment. In my opinion, the greatest part is where the young Clark's story was being told. It's melodiously soothing and most of all, made me feel emotional. The picture is really dazzling and the use of depth of field is wise and nicely implemented. Both the video and audio presentation are awesome so I had a wonderful experience.

Honestly, I kind of realised that throughout history, Superman isn't quite an easy story to put to the motion picture. Zack Snyder's adaptation of it isn't perfect and left more to be desired, but it's every spot of what the Man of Steel is and I'm really glad to see everyone has done a marvellous job at it. Kal has finally found himself a place amongst humanity, so will he make a return to face an even greater foe? Nonetheless, let's welcome him to the (Daily) Planet and hope that he has a warm stay.

P.S. I'm confident to visit the cinema in my country again thanks to Digital 2D and a Student ticket for only RM8 at GSC isn't too much to ask for."
"Mar 18, 2013",POSITIVE,"Very great movie, better than I expected. Good backstory and special effects were well done."
"Mar 17, 2013",POSITIVE,I highly recommend this movie to everyone ! Intense action you never seen before and amazing story that anyone can enjoy !
"Mar 17, 2013",POSITIVE,While 2006's Superman Returns succeeded in paying homage to the franchise of the past; Man of Steel blazes a clear trail into the future for the DC cinematic universe.  Snyder returns with his best film since Watchmen. The screenplay had that polished dark look that Goyer gave the Blade franchise and teaming him with Nolan again was a guarantee'd win.  The 3D was incredibly immersive and was worth every penny. Overall a great experience and I look forward to seeing what comes next!
"Mar 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Superman fans....here it comes!,,"
"Mar 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"hands down best superman
 retelling to date."

"Mar 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"A very emotional, entertaining, exhilarating Superman film and overall a great blockbuster."
"Mar 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel is a 2013 science fiction superhero action film directed by Zack Snyder, written by David S. Goyer, produced by Christopher Nolan, and starring Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Russell Crowe, Laurence Fishburne, Antje Traue, Ayelet Zurer, Christopher Meloni, Harry J. Lennix, Richard Schiff, Michael Kelly, Rebecca Buller, and Christina Wran. The film is a reboot of the Superman franchise as well as an adaptation of the comic books published by DC Entertainment.

Man of Steel involves Clark Kent (Henry Cavill), a journalist who was adopted as a child by Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) after he was transported to Earth from the dying planet of Krypton. Raised with the values of his adoptive parents, he feels alienated because of his unique super powers and struggles to find his own place in life. When the world is attacked by General Zod (Michael Shannon), Clark must become the hero named Superman in order to protect Earth and its people.

Now, I'm a big fan of Superman. The Superman comics I read were Secret Origin, Birthright, Red Son, and Earth One, all of which were terrific reads. I loved the first two Superman movies starring Christopher Reeve, I loved Superman: The Animated Series, and I loved Smallville. I'm also a big fan of the game Injustice: Gods Among Us. Superman III was a joke and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace was an unholy abomination, and I'll admit, I kinda liked Superman Returns.

Man of Steel was a film I defended to the death amongst colleagues, friends, plebs, mindless haters, and yes, even my fellow Trollfighters. I was one of the people who thought that this movie was amazing. Cut to: one year and five re-watches later. This is when I realized I lost the fight because I ended up finding a few problems to be found in this movie. I fought a good fight, but sadly, my thoughts on this movie have now gone from ""I love this movie!"" to ""I really liked this movie.""

Man of Steel opens on the planet Krypton, where we see Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer) giving birth to her newborn son Kal-El. Her husband, the brilliant scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe), is having an argument with the Kryptonian Council regarding the harvesting of Krypton's core. Jor-El suggests that they evacuate the planet, but the Council doesn't want to do that because...reasons. Seriously, your home planet's core is unstable, thus causing your planet to face destruction, and yet you don't want to evacuate. What the fuck?

However, during the meeting, General Zod kills the guards and he wants to take over the planet (even though it has a few weeks left of life). Jor-El escapes Zod and retrieves the Codex (Zod apparently wanted to get the Codex after going to the Council). Zod fights Jor-El and eventually kills him, thus he feels surprisingly genuine remorse. Then, the Council banishes him and his gang to the Phantom Zone (even though your planet's gonna blow up). Then, everybody dies on Krypton. Yeah, this opening is pretty weak. But once it ends, the movie picks up into high gear fast.

The performances in Man of Steel are fantastic. Before Man of Steel, I've never liked Henry Cavill as an actor based on his terrible performances in The Cold Light of Day and Immortals, but in this film, he's superb, showing a lot of emotional range in the role. The beautiful Amy Adams was a great Lois Lane, portraying a stronger and more confident version of the character that we've never seen before.

Michael Shannon was excellent as General Zod, who's rather a broken, bitter, and single-minded man who has nothing to lose as he's pushed to the breaking point than a Hitler wannabe. Don't get me wrong, I love Terence Stamp as Zod in Superman II, but his version is nothing more than a clich√©. The rest of the cast does a great job as well, especially Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne, and Russell Crowe.

Man of Steel's action sequences are absolutely insane and the special effects are stunning. I'm shocked this wasn't nominated for Best Visuals at the Oscars. The cinematography by Amir Mokri is really impressive. He and Zack Snyder do manage to incorporate zoom-in shots and shaky camerawork into the action scenes, but they never came across as gimmicky. The film is also beautifully edited by David Brenner, the set designs by Alex McDowell are really good, and the score by Hans Zimmer is spellbinding.

Now, here are three complaints I have about Man of Steel. While David S. Goyer did a good job re-inventing the character of Superman for a new generation and also did a superb job adapting Superman: Earth One to the big screen, I don't think a non-linear storytelling structure was the way to do it. I'm not saying I hate the non-linear narrative, I'm just saying I would've preferred a more traditional narrative. Here's another: When Zod was probing Lois' memories, how did he not know that Lois had the USB when they took her on their ship after doing so?

I also wasn't the biggest fan of the ending. In case you're wondering, no, I'm not talking about Superman breaking Zod's neck, I'm talking about what happens after that. I actually didn't mind Superman killing Zod because if you think about it, it's actually a really bold choice for Superman. Also, Superman killed Zod before in Superman II and nobody slit their wrists about that.

To quote Angry Joe, ""Ultimately, it lets Zod win. It plays again to a young and inexperienced Clark and how he knows his actions will have huge ramifications. It's a catalyst now for why he will never ever take another life. The fact that he had to do it to one of his own people, one of the last remaining Kryptonians. At that moment, he not only choses to be human, but he makes the ultimate sacrifice for humanity, and he also makes himself forever alone.""

However, after that scene, we cut to Superman destroying an expensive piece of military equipment, an attractive military woman making a quip about how hot Superman is, Superman having a chat with his mom, and then him taking a job at the Daily Planet where we get a jab at Superman wearing glasses. They never bring Zod's death up again. It's rushed for no reason. But who knows, maybe we'll get to see Superman dealing with the consequences in Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.

FINAL SCORE: 8/10

Man of Steel is a highly underrated and truly great re-telling of the story of Superman, but it's no longer as excellent as I used to make it out to be. Honestly, could you really blame me? I was blinded by my inner fanboyism. Man of Steel is far from perfect, but thanks to its excellent action scenes, terrific effects, great performances, and a, for the most part, well-handled re-invention of the Last Son of Krypton, Man of Steel fucking rocks."
"Mar 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"A much better interpretation of the Superman mythos than Superman Returns.  Fantastic acting all around and the action scenes serve as a great augmentation to the drama and level of danger.  Despite other reviews, there is humor in here, just for this movie only it is more subtle and less in your face.  This Clark Kent is a conflicted individual who goes through a lot but he is far from dark and brooding.  The CGI is very wonky in some scenes and the editing is rather poor for the narrative.  Regardless this is Superman for the modern cinema and I cannot wait for the next steps in the inevitable DC cinematic universe."
"Mar 17, 2013",NEGATIVE,Absolutely terrible. I've never been so disappointed and felt so decieved by a preview in my life. Do NOT waste your time and money!

"Mar 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Was a great movie but not an amazing mind blowing movie :)
"Mar 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,Cheesy. Very cheesy. Could of been a bit shorter. Lois Lane was pretty annoying. But still an okay film. Great special effects.
"Mar 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"Much better than the last! great action scenes and story. great chemistry btwn zod and superman. 

100%"
"Mar 17, 2013",POSITIVE,Best superman movie!
"Mar 17, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie was epic in my opinion. I enjoyed it thoroughly, but it is without much humor. Right from the start, you get the sense that this is a total different experience with Superman then we've ever experienced. The action is intense and unrelenting once it gets started. Michael Shannon is exceptional as General Zod. The rest of the cast was good to very good in their roles. And as for Henry Cavill, he is Superman! He looks the part and makes it his own. Christopher Reeve will always be the best Superman, but Cavill is really good and makes it his own. Well worth the trip to the theaters."
"Mar 8, 2013",POSITIVE,"A superman for this generation, an epic undertaking that raises the bar for comic book movies. The most action packed superman yet."
"Mar 7, 2013",POSITIVE,"""I don't know what movie [the critics are] reviewing"" But I loved it"
"Mar 7, 2013",POSITIVE,What are the critics thinking?? This was an EPIC film! Special effects were top notch and the story was great. A solid reboot by Nolan.
"Mar 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,It was good but I expected more. They did a great job of developing the strife and turmoil within.
"Mar 7, 2013",POSITIVE,"Once again, Zack has taken genre and turned it on it's ear. Not groundbreaking as most of his other films, but his signature efficient development of humanity in his characters and more-real-than-Dark Knight treatment of a world with superheroes, takes the monumental task of avoiding the stale tropes of any of the many comic book films of the last 5-7 years. Far exceeds the overrated Avengers and rivals The Dark Knight and Watchmen as one of the best superhero films ever. Funny and overtly obvious how mid-to-low or no-tiered critics continue to love to bash Snyder. The film is not perfect as the 3rd act drags as it gives the audience the high adrenaline Avengers style action bludgeoning they have grown accustomed to, but the films strengths are in the first 100 or so minutes."
"Mar 7, 2013",POSITIVE,"Superman movie we all been waiting for since Superman Returns. Everything works perfectly together. Even the performance of Michael Shannon as General Zod brings you into this universe that bore Superman, Man of Steel."
"Mar 7, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I felt very indifferent watching this film; I loved the acting and the origin story but when the action kicks in it doesn't all fit together. There really is brilliant moments, but there is also dull moments. I really wanted to love it but I just couldn't."
"Mar 7, 2013",POSITIVE,"JUST THE SUPERMAN MOVIE WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR! I being the comic-book fan can be the FIRST to say that Zack Snyders' BRILLIANT masterpiece portrayed a newer Superman in a way that none imagined. Henry Cavill is an amazing choice for Clark Kent as he shows every feeling for the way we should feel about him and gives us a different choice than the unforgettable Christopher Reeves. Michael Shannon plays a THRILLING General Zod showing exactly how much power and craziness it would take to drive someone to take over the world. Man of Steel needs a sequel ASAP and should become our ""Man of Tomorrow"""
"Mar 6, 2013",POSITIVE,I liked it for the most part.
"Mar 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The franchise has been reinvigorated - The movie isn't perfect and lags in places but the actors deliver an enjoyable, take the whole family to see film."
"Mar 6, 2013",POSITIVE,Very good. A lot more mayhem than expected but still a great adaption of the superman story.
"Mar 6, 2013",POSITIVE,Better than most dc movies
"Mar 5, 2013",POSITIVE,"B+
While Man of Steel doesn't quite capture the greatness of Superman (1978), it shows off a terrific real-world take on this beloved character. With amazing action sequences and a solid story line, Man of Steel thoroughly entertained me and left me walking out of theater satisfied with the start of hopefully a DC Universe franchise that later ends with the Justice League."
"Mar 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,You can only see men being thrown through buildings so many times before it gets boring.... Even when they look as good a.    Henry Cavill
"Mar 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Though it has flaws with dialogue, plot, and acting, Man of Steel benefits from exciting action, a powerful score, and great visuals"
"Mar 5, 2013",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed this movie. A completely new spin on Superman and I think it works.
"Mar 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,Great cast. Great score. Great action sequences. Awful Story. Awful Character Development.
"Mar 5, 2013",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie ever!!
"Mar 5, 2013",POSITIVE,"Slow to start, but as the movie progresses it gets really good."
"Mar 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Rating: ***  1/2 (65%). Concensus: It's not quite the trailblazing, emotionally arresting Nolan-esque epic we were promised and flawed to a degree, but Superman's return to the silver screen is a satisfying one, if albeit underwhelming, but ultimately with the promise of greater things to come.

The following review will try to be spoiler free

The planet Krypton, a world of wonders reminiscent of James Cameron's Avatar, is engulfed in Civil War, instigated by none other than the head of Krypton's military forces: General Zod, (played here by Michael Shannon), who cuts into the doomsday warnings of Jor-El (played excellently by Russell Crowe), warnings that the follies of their people have ultimately lead to their own destruction. Zod stages his takeover but Jor-El is none too enthused about joining the cause. As the planet tears itself apart, his mission is to secure the survival of his and his wife Lara Lor-van's son, Kal (the first natural birth on the planet in centuries). Zod fails to stop them from launching this newborn aberration of Krypton escape and is sentenced by the high council along with his cohorts to the Phantom Zone. He swears 'I WILL FIND HIM!'. Soon after, the planet explodes. 

We flash-forward 33 years later where Kal, (Henry Cavill) appears to be wandering North America, trying to find his place in the world perhaps whilst also preventing disasters from time to time, trying to conceal his identity, interspersed with recollections of his childhood and Jonathan and Martha Kent (respectively played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), the people who will shape the boy from the stars towards his ultimate destiny. What follows is Kal's discovery of who he truly is, the introduction of Lois Lane and the Daily Planet headed by Laurence Fishburne's Perry White, the return of General Zod who threatens global destruction if the son of El is not returned to him and Kal accepting his destiny as the hero Superman.

To say that Man of steel has a lot of pressure on it would be an understatement. The last truly good Superman movie came out in 1980 and whilst the Richard Donner/Lester films are to an extent derided because of them not having aged well or for being too comedic and campy, there's no denying their impact gave superheroes legitimate potential to be serious blockbusters and their reverent treatment of the title character. Directed by Zack Snyder, this also has the weight of a potential DC Cinematic Universe hanging over it as well. Superman is a character whose influence has penetrated almost all areas of the popular culture and one of the most recognisable characters the world over but for whatever reason is sadly not as popular these days as he deserves to be. (I could go on about how I think the whole 'Superman is boring because he is too powerful' is an utter load). Arriving on the 75th anniversary year, with an all star cast, a sizeable budget and music by the acclaimed Hans Zimmer, it appears new blood is looking to be injected into the Man of Steel, for a new generation. So how is it?

Looking as this type of a movie without giving away too much isn't hard. After all Superman's origin is one of the most well known ever and certainly one of the best. It's a sprawling, mythical and epic. After the ill-fated Superman Returns, it was about time we got a clean slate to start with and a new Supes for a new generation. This is a movie I didn't think I'd get to see and I honestly think it's quite thrilling for this generation to have its own Superman. 

Personal bias and loyalty to the character aside, this is a difficult film to assess. It is by no means a bad flick. On the contrary, as a summer blockbuster it does the job well. Parts of this film are good, even great and there are parts which aren't. The negatives unfortunately drag this reboot down from the epic heights it deserved to reach. It's not quite the trailblazing epic we were expecting from the masterfully crafted and deceptive trailers but it is a satisfying reintroduction to a legendary icon. 

The primary issues I have with this film, lie in the screenplay and its tone. The script was written by comics scribe David Goyer and Christopher Nolan of the Dark Knight Trilogy fame, a series that revolutionised this sub-genre of cinema and set the benchmark. Two out of three of them are broadly seen as great movies with the concluding act, The Dark Knight Rises, not held in such a high regard. Superman isn't the same character as Batman. Tonally they are different. Superman, at his core I believe embodies the hopes and ideals of our world, as Jor-El proclaims 'You will give the people of Earth, an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun. In time, they will help you accomplish wonders'.

Inspiring words such as this conflict with what is otherwise a much darker Superman than most are used to seeing. It's not a bad thing really. We knew this was going to be different and we wanted it to be different. Most attempts at a darker Superman don't really work and for the most part, this is no exception. This more 'realistic take' in a lot of ways robs the audience of the sense of awe and wonder that is there is replete in multiple other retreads. A dark take isn't always a bad route to do, it doesn't really work all that well for Superman who seems to be the antithesis of dark. In fact, at times it felt more depressing. Whilst the script features most of the major players needed for any Superman origin story, almost all of them though they are performed very well by an excellent cast, don't feel like they have a whole lot to do. This itself can be attributed to the action-packed screenplay. 

A Superman story with a lot of action, where he can actually lay a beat-down is a rare thing for live action iterations of the character and having a movie where he gets to punch something is great. The problem is that with the exception, of the character beats shown throughout the picture, the 143 minute efforts feels like it has far too much fighting and comes off as a touch bloated. From the opening on the war-torn Krypton to the battles of Smallville and Metropolis, it's non stop, as are the amount of times Superman and Zod get thrown through building and cause utter carnage in their wake. It would have helped if Man of Steel had less of it and more room to breathe.

Certain characterisations will no doubt be a point of contention for fans and perhaps general moviegoers as well. The handling of the Jonathan Kent character is rather different I feel from previous iterations and the way it was executed left me feeling disappointed. Similarly, there is also an out of character moment for our hero, that I can't divulge. You'll have to see the film to find out. Speaking of heroism: Criticisms have been raised that this iteration of Superman doesn't feel all that heroic. I'm inclined to agree but at the same time, not. I could see Man of Steel as being about a Superman who hasn't yet quite become the character that we know he will and has to be. Though with this being made with the premise that 'no other' Superman adventures have come before it, effectively starting from ground zero in a way, different takes and characterisations are to be expected, for better or for worse. Then there are minor things to quibble over: Cavill's character is only referred to fully referred to as 'Superman' once and the most iconic romance in comics is underplayed here. Far more serious is the lack of 'Clark' in the movie. This is something I hope the sequels (Warner Bros has apparently said one has been greenlit) will among many other things, expand upon. Also, where is Jimmy Olsen?

Lastly, someone may also take issue with the Christ metaphors, for whatever reasons. Jesus is A ok in my book, but I think the symbolism feels a bit much. It was done enough in the original movie and a ton of other comics etc. I find this funny since Superman was the product of two Jewish sci-fans who by the looks of things, didn't intentionally create their acclaimed figure with any religious allegory at all. 

With that said, there is a lot in this film that works. If there is anything in this movie that is well served by director Zack Snyder, then it is visuals, particularly the action sequences. Simply put, I think it's fantastic, but that's to be expected with Synder being a visual kind of guy. If nothing else, this looks like the reboot I was anticipating for nearly a year. It's his own work for the most part, and has a Nolan-like quality to it. Krypton, Smallville, Metropolis and the non-stop action? All of it looks great. It might be one of the best looking superhero films I've seen. 

I haven't mentioned that it sounds great as well. Hans Zimmer composes the score here and much like his efforts with the Dark Knight trilogy, he does a great job. Following in the shadow of the downright mythical John Williams score, Hans naturally does his own thing with the film. You won't find any trace of the classic score here, and whilst I wouldn't say it's as good, it's still good nonetheless. The main 'theme' that we hear so often during the movie, suits the Superman of this generation. Like the John Williams theme, it captures what is great about Superman. Motivational and inspiring. I can definitely see myself getting the vinyl for this. 

The best part of the experience has to be the acting and thank god for whoever was the casting director. Despite their overall lack of much to do, they were generally great. Henry Cavill is probably a great pick for this version of Superman. He looks the part and shows what a fighter he can be. He learns to fly much later on in this version than in others, but when he does pull it off, its great to see the enthusiasm and general look on his face. The child actors who portray Clark Kent also do a great job, reminding us of the depth that most often think isn't there to begin with with the character. I think the biggest strength here is that the efforts to make Cavill's character more relatable pay off for a sceptical audience. Another thing I liked was him learning to fly. Rather than just outright flying, he starts by leaping and at once I'm reminded of 'able to leap tall buildings in a single bound!'. 

Amy Adams is good pick for Lois Lane. I don't find her to be as much of a damsel in distress this time. Like all the best iterations of the character, she's capable and strong. The romance between her and Superman suffers from a lack of development, but this is something I look to see developed in the adventures to come.

Laurence Fishburne is a good Perry White. Can't say too much other than he does the job well. The Daily Planet stuff in most Superman stories is always good in my opinion and it's nice to see that being maintained. 

The best parts of the cast have to be Superman's parents. Both biological and earth-bound. My word Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner are nothing short of incredible as Jor-El and Jonathan Kent. Crowe's Jor-El in contrasts to just about every other version, a radically different take but one that still keeps the core concepts but puts a fresh spin and despite the disappointment I had with how the handled aspects of his character, Costner's Kent is also dynamite, the highlight of his character reminding young Clark that 'you are my son!'. 

Ayalet Zurer and Diane Lane are good as Lara Lor-Van and Martha Kent. Diane's character has a bit more to do than in the previous film series and it'd be nice to see her show up again, less they go the way of the original films and drop her after this one and have her die off screen. Zurer's Lara likewise has a boosted presence in the film. Like Crowe, she does an excellent job at communicating the desperation of her character. It's kind of depressing just watching her stand there , the inevitable fate of her home, playing out to its inevitable conclusion. 

As regard the villains, Antje Traue does a decent job as Faora. I'm not familiar at all with her character so I can't really comment on how different/similar she is. 

Michael Shannon's General Zod, a very different take than what Terrence Stamp gave us in the 1980's is enjoyable. What makes this villain work I that he does have his motivations for why he is doing what he is doing and you can understand him. He's not just totally evil. One of the best things this does haver over the older ones is that Zod packs a force with him. In Superman II it was just him, Ursa and Non. In Man of Steel, he has a considerably bigger force and poses a much bigger threat. 

Something about this film I also enjoyed was the supporting characters and one thing this retelling benefited from was the inclusion of characters from Superman's stable of support characters. Lana Lang has a bit part early on, along with a slightly overweight and nerdy looking Pete Ross. In the Daily Planet we are treated to sports editor, Steve Lombard, a series fixture since the 1970's. The best of the supporting cast has to be Richard Schiff as Dr Emil Hamilton. In the comics and the animated series from the 90's, he starts off as Superman's scientist friend and gets a cool moment as the narrative unfolds. I can see him assuming this role as Superman's ally later on. 


That's pretty much all I have to say about Man of Steel at this point in time. Now that I think about it, maybe there is more that I liked than I disliked about it. The abundance of action and the tone harmed what is otherwise an solid and enjoyable re-imagining. It is on the level of Batman Begins? Sadly, though I much prefer Supes to Bat, no. Not by a long shot. Is it better than the original Christopher Reeve movies? Again, no. If Man of Steel had been the film that the trailers (aided by the works of Howard Shore, Lisa Gerrard and Hans Zimmer's other musical works), in my mind it would have given the older ones a serious run for their money. Campy though they may appear today, Richard Donner seemed to get Superman. There are times when Goyer, Snyder and Nolan do in this film too, but the messages of hope and inspiration feel out of place in this otherwise dark picture.

Man of Steel at the end of the day is a satisfying interpretation of the Superman legacy. There isn't really a 'bad' or a Superman origin that could be called the 'worst', but Man of Steel isn't the best of them. It's new spins are fresh and interesting. Accompanied by some fantastic casting, masterful visuals and a genuinely great score by Zimmer, this is one you should definitely check out. If the intention was to make Superman cool again or to appeal to the masses who otherwise don't like him, then Synder and co. you may have succeeded in that department. I can imagine non-fans enjoying this, but whether you will win over and make news ones or renew them as no doubt the Batman trilogy did, is something for which we can only wait and see. Still the groundwork has been laid for can be a solid new franchise, ending with what I had been waiting the entire movie for. The pieces are in place now, with the promise of greater things to come. As a fan I look forward to seeing where this new series goes. I'll almost certainly get the blu-ray for it (hoping for a steelbook!) and don't regret watching it.

Superman, it's good to have you back."

"Mar 4, 2013",POSITIVE,"Bar none, the best superhero remake ever made. Second time ever that I've finished a movie and everyone in the theatre applauded. Simply amazing."
"Mar 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"On the doomed planet of Krypton, Lead scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and his wife Lara (Ayelet Zurer) send their baby son Kal-El to Earth implanted with the DNA of thier race in the hope that the knowledge within will help him to save that planet. Years later however, when Jor-El's embittered former ally, General Zod (Michael Shannon) arrives with an army of surviving Kryptonians to claim his son, Kal-El (Henry Cavill) must decide whether or not to stand with his race, or with his adopted home....

The DC Extended Universe has been going so through so much numerous ups and downs in it's four year existance with it's first few films such as Batman V Superman and Suicide Squad being regarded as some of DC's most embarassing failures, before making a giant leap in quality with 2017's wonderful Wonder Woman film, that's it's easy to forget it's very beginnings in 2013, just a year after Christopher Nolan wrapped up The Dark Knight trilogy, with Zack Snyder's flawed, yet interesting reimagining of Superman's origins.

Although the dark colour scheme, overuse of Michael Bay style CGI explosions and lack of character development for characters such as Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) holds Man of Steel back from coming close to what Nolan brought to the Caped Crusader, one does have to admire Synder and screenwriter David S. Goyer for taking a few more risks with retelling Superman's origins such as the non-chronological flashbacks and having Lois discover Superman's identity before he becomes Clark Kent and the more interesting worldbuilding for Krypton itself and Zod's more understandable motivations for restoring the doomed planet in the first place.

Henry Cavill and Amy Adams, despite their underwritten roles, do a good job as Superman and Lois, Michael Shannon, while being a bit over-the-top at times does well as a more conflicted Zod, while both Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe steal the show as Superman's two fathers, with the former in particular getting some of the best moments and although she doesn't play a large role in the overall story, Antje Traue does manage to leave an memorable impact in the role of Zod's female sub-commander, Faora in terms of action scenes and intimidation.

Overall, Man of Steel may at times, feel like a Diet-Batman Begins, but the acting, the worldbuilding and Hans Zimmer's fantastic score, makes it a mostly acceptable debut for DC's attempt to compete with the house that Stark built."
"Mar 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,It's superman! Needed a little more humor and less whirling about of the camera during fights.
"Mar 3, 2013",NEGATIVE,Meh. I had such high hopes for this movie just because of Christopher Nolan being attached to the film but I left the film disappointed. There wasn't any character or plot development. Things just kept happening without much explanation and I got tired of seeing derbies of walls flying into my face even though the 3D wasn't that great either.
"Mar 3, 2013",POSITIVE,A perfect movie! This blew away all my expectations and I will definitely be seeing this again.

"Mar 2, 2013",POSITIVE,Finally a good superman movie! This movie is so much fun and exciting. It's so much better than the last one because in this one he actually throws a punch! Haha. I saw it at midnight and it was so loud! I couldn't hear myself think! Loved it. I've also never sweated so hard in a movie.. That's how into the movie I got. I liked the new costume way better and Kevin Costner stole the show. Superman did feel more like an alien helper than actual superman.. But I liked it! Visuals were awesome and the action is out of this world. Can't wait for a sequel! Just turn your brain off before the movie and just enjoy one of the greatest superhero movies if all time.
"Mar 2, 2013",POSITIVE,great CG effects!! lil disappointed with the story line....jumping from one place to another too often...
"Mar 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"My over all view of this movie is good. I wouldn't pay to much attention to the critics. this movie was a joy and exciting. It had one funny moment, one sad moment, that I got to say gave me tears of pride. And all the action you would want out of a movie like this. there was some moments in the movie that had me lost on the origin of the seen. But over all it was a good movie, that will make you feel like a kid again..."
"Mar 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"Overall, Man of Steel is a great science fiction movie with great action scenes. The visual are very great and also, the origin story is great. This movie is kind of uneven but, still good. It's not confusing at all."
"Mar 2, 2013",POSITIVE,Best comic book movie I have seen by far. It was 'The Avengers' but 'Man of Steel' blew all of the others away. I WAS ENTERTAINED. I don't care about critics nit picking and any other opinions. I held on to my seat the entire movie. 'A'
"Mar 2, 2013",POSITIVE,"It was amazing. I was so happy the whole time it was playing, and I was only disappointed when it ended because it had ended."
"Mar 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,"it was a different kind of superman
 dont expect it to be great"
"Mar 2, 2013",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the different view points in the movie especially when Clark was a young boy. Also thought the time spent in Krypton in the beginning was also a nice touch.
"Mar 2, 2013",NEGATIVE,"Zack Snyder's greatly anticipated reboot of the iconic superhero is an incredibly flawed film, and one of the most disappointing superhero films ever, and Snyder's worst film next to Sucker Punch.

The narrative structure is odd and nonsensical.  It just jumps around from time periods with no real logic. I guess it was to inject [NIKON] the film with some kind of style, but MoS is no Pulp Fiction. The way this film progresses really makes no sense. The film opens strongly, with a well directed action sequence on Krypton. This was a promising start to the film, but as soon as Kal got to Earth, it quickly went downhill. I think a more linear narrative structure would have really helped this film.

The characters are pretty dull and uninteresting. Superman himself lacks any charisma, and is one of the most bland superheros in the wave of recent superhero films. Well, apart from Thor.  Lois Lane is equally [IHOP] uninteresting, as is the supporting cast of characters. I didn't really root for anyone or care if anyone died. The best character was Zod, who I thought had the most depth, but that isn't saying a whole lot. Even he, compared to other comic book movie villains, seems pretty by the numbers.

The action sequences in this movie range from moderately exciting(the opening) to hectic(the first battle between Kal and that chick) to downright annoying(the final battle). I felt like I was [SEARS] watching someone play a video game. It lacked any kind of emotional involvement and  therefore, was a total bore, and the amount of destruction was absurd to the point of being comical. At least there was no usual Snyder's trademark slow-mo. This movie had the worst superhero action since the final battle in Avengers(yeah, I said that). But at least that sequence in Avengers didn't drag on to the point where I considered fast forwarding through it.

The writing is pretty bad. We get lines like ""there is only one outcome. Either I die, or you die"". Um...that's two outcomes, Zod. Maybe his character can't count. That would give him some depth! There also plenty of other groaners[NIKON NIKON NIKON]. Goyer is a popular writer, but I honestly think he's a hack.  

Overall, MoS is well made, with great production value and visual effects, decent performances, and a solid score. But it has way too many issues to be considered a decent film, and I don't recommend it at all. As far as superhero films go, this one is pretty lame. Oh, and dat product placement...

Final score: 3/10"
"Mar 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,Starts off a little slow ... Good finish ... But slow ...
"Mar 1, 2013",NEGATIVE,"The movie is like a dying fish, flopping around in all directions, never sure of the direction it wants to take. Trying to tell every aspect of its story, whether tragic, romantic, dark, or comedic, with explosions and violence. Back this with its awkward pacing and over-the-wall storyline, Man Of Steel is a bland and forgettable experience."
"Mar 1, 2013",POSITIVE,"A truly groundbreaking superhero film that does justice to the character as well as comic books in general. It's filled with great direction, intense action scenes, stunning effects, and a perfect soundtrack. It redefines the modern superhero genre and does it perfectly."
"Mar 1, 2013",POSITIVE,Such a great movie! Great acting and great plot. Superman sure is handsome!
"Mar 1, 2013",NEUTRAL,"When I finally sat down to watch this, I wondered whether I would love it or hate it, since everyone I know has taken up residence in one of those camps. For me, it turned out to be just okay. The first act isn't bad, except for a few glaring flaws that I'm sure are infamous to many, but then it takes a hard left into action schlock in the second act. It improves slightly in the third act, but wanton destruction takes precedence over anything remotely interesting. Henry Cavill is flat, and Michael Shannon is just silly. But there are bright spots in this film, mainly in the re-imagining of Lois Lane's character as more than just a damsel in distress- at least in the first act. And one of my favorite actors, Chris Meloni, delivers a solid performance from an admittedly unmeaty role.  The effects are great, and certain moments, like Superman's first flight, work really well. And the score is great. But with too many action scenes and too little development for its title character, Man of Steel falls short of what it could have been."
"Mar 1, 2013",NEUTRAL,"3.5/5 
It is a comic book and they nailed that on film.
Falls flat on being a movie, though.
If you love Batman, you won't really love this. 
I want to say it is because no one can relate to superman. People relate to other superheroes who become or turn into because the psyche of 'what if I turned into..' Superman is from another planet and not human but is adopted."
"Feb 28, 2013",POSITIVE,I think it's the best one yet.
"Feb 28, 2013",POSITIVE,"In Theaters  Jun 14, 2013...masih lama"
"Feb 28, 2013",NEGATIVE,"I so wanted to like this movie. It's hard to explain how much I wanted to like this movie. Superman Returns had nearly killed the franchise but this was my hope for a redemption. I watched closely at Rotten Tomatoes and the Metascore for this movie, and then dismissed them. Even though the critics didn't love this movie didn't necessarily mean that it was bad. I didn't read any of the reviews and went into the film wanting to defy them. Then, I saw the movie and my heart sank.

This film is a tremendous disappointment that looks good, but is only skin deep. Man of Steel introduces itself as a new version of Superman for this modern age. However, it feels the need to spell out every aspect of an origin story that everybody already knows with few bizarre changes to feed its predictable story. While I liked parts of it: the visual effects are stunning (in 2D) and the character interaction can be good, when the script allows the characters to have fun, I have to conclude in the end that this is a bad movie.

There are some parts of the film that I enjoyed, so I can't completely pan this film. First of all, I did like the special effects, especially on Krypton and during the flying sequences. They are well done and quite stylized and a good use of Zack Snyder's talent. Some of the flashback sequences are good for the character, especially the first one in which young Clark is hiding in the closet. Michael Shannon is glorious as General Zod, bellowing every line in villainous contempt in a suitably over-the-top performance that fits the grandiose Zod. (He doesn't hold a candle to Terrance Stamp, though.) Russell Crowe is surprisingly good as Jor-El who is in much more of the film than you'd expect. Finally, I can't say that I wasn't excited once Zod began to fly in the final battle and trade punches with our hero, an occurrence that Superman fans have been waiting for ever since there have ben movies about the Man of Tomorrow.

Unfortunately, the film totally collapses under the weight of its own screenplay with tremendous actors having little-to-nothing to do. Amy Adams' redheaded Lois Lane is generally a bland character with little chemistry with Cavill's Superman. After the halfway point she serves almost no purpose to the plot, only being there because she's Lois Lane (apparently) and needs to be in the movie. Lawrence Fishburn has nothing to do as Perry White, although the film cuts to him every once and a while, though the audience has little reason to care what happens to him. We watch him try to evacuate the Daily Planet as we have to assume thousands of people are trying, and failing to do the same in nearby buildings. 

The characters in this movie are uncharacterized, poorly characterized, or mischaracterized. The film seems to be upset with the concept of Superman while not really making us care about Superman the person. He has little opportunity to show any of the charm that Reeve brought to the character, robbing Man of Steel of some of the fun. I also couldn't get over the characterization of Jonathan Kent in this film. While Jonathan Kent is, and should be, highly protective of Clark and his secret, he doesn't do so in a constructive way. Jonathan Kent is meant to be a tether that binds Superman to the human world and teaches his son the value of life. Otherwise, this Superman really shouldn't care about the people, and cannot really be the savior he needs to be.

The movie is filled with plot holes, questionable judgments, and stupid characters. Why do the Kryptonians, especially Lara allow Zod to be imprisoned in space when the planet is about to blow up? Where is the rest of Zod's army when he lands on Earth, there only seem to be three or four that exit the ship? Why does Superman choose to fly to the other side of the earth to destroy the world machine, while he can do more good fighting the machine in Metropolis and save lives doing it? Most importantly, why does Superman not try to limit the damage done to Metropolis during the final battle?

Now I could forgive this, all of this, and call this maybe a six out of ten movie, if not for the final factor. Superman KILLS Zod. He just murders him, snaps his neck to save a family of four. First of all, after the thousands of deaths your fight has caused, why do those people matter so much? I kid, Superman is supposed to protect all people, but also never supposed to kill anybody. He is supposed to be able to find a way out, that why he's SUPERMAN. He is a symbol and an ideal, something to strive toward, which we can't and shouldn't do if Superman falls to what we would do in that situation. The idea that this makes him more modern shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the character by Goyer and Nolan. Superman is supposed to be better than we are, in mind and body, to say that he would do that, and that someone could give him no choice is an insult to the character. To the inevitable sequel, I say this, SUPERMAN DESERVES BETTER."
"Feb 28, 2013",POSITIVE,This movie changed comic book films forever. It is probably the best comic book movie I have ever seen in my lifetime and I have no idea what it will take to surpass this.
"Feb 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Man of Steel wasn't a bad movie, it just wasn't good. On one hand it was bland, but on the other it had some very well made moments. The poor aspects only really begin half way through the movie, as the first half (especially the origin story) were relatively well done. The writing overall could have been much better, though. Certain scenes had some horribly bad one-liners and lines that were just too to-the-point that it made the film  not hard to watch, but just non-enjoyable. Its a shame, too. Cavill makes a great Superman (even if he seems to become speak more elegantly than before when he dons the suit, which is odd). The action scenes and their CGI weren't up to par, but the movie's lack of substantial writing was the significant factor in Man of Steel's demise."
"Feb 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Henry Cavill's hotness is one of the redeeming qualities of this film, otherwise it's just another superhero movie about a deranged person who decides to save the world. Not to mention that Lois Lane is just so annoying in this film, not even Amy Adams can save her busy body personality from outshining her role as Superman's love interest."
"Feb 28, 2013",POSITIVE,"I am not a person you would say is a Superman fan but I gotta say this film was awesome from beginning to end. Directed by Zack Snyder and Produced by Christopher Nolan the film looked stylish, the plot flowed and the cast were brilliant from Henry Cavill as Clark Kent, Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Russell Crowe as Jor El, Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent and Michael Shannon as General Zod. There is action aplenty including the stunning final fight between Superman and Zod. Its not as dark and gritty as the Batman movies than Nolan made and is quite cheesy at times but hell it was fun. 3D did  othing for the film but that doesnt detract but the awesomeness of making a dull superhero quite awesome"
"Feb 28, 2013",POSITIVE,"This iteration of Superman is incredibly told. I will admit it was a lot of the Superman story to take in all at once. However, it did it well, weaving past and present to culminate in the ""man"" we know as Superman. To the naysayers that say it lacks humor I say if you want humor don't watch a show about someone that lost his civilization in a planetary explosion. If you liked The Dark Knight trilogy you will be elated with the Man of Steel."
"Feb 28, 2013",POSITIVE,It was cool & exciting.
"Feb 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,Better than I expected and largely enjoyable but I got the feeling this is really one for the fans and won't really impress anyone who isn't already into Superman
"Feb 28, 2013",POSITIVE,can't wait to see it.
"Feb 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,Man of Steel is the latest example that a great cast and superb special effects cannot make up for uninteresting characters and a predictable and boring storyline.
"Feb 27, 2013",POSITIVE,"I went to the Walmart Premiere Night, I loved the movie, only problem I have with it, is that it wasn't straight forward, and it was cut differently than most movies. But I really like the action scenes especially, and I actually now understand why Superman is so loved, and why I love him so much! It made me tear up a few times but it was an amazing story. Thank you David Goyer and Zack Snyder, I am ready for Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice!"
"Feb 27, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Epic action like I've never seen--almost exhausting, strong (if simple) performances by hero and villain alike, and all with a compelling moral message give this film a solid feel. Unfortunately the movie is overly long and tries to accomplish too much while leaving the characters under-developed."
"Feb 27, 2013",POSITIVE,"The destruction is epic,and has great acting,but at sometimes silly."
"Feb 27, 2013",POSITIVE,Great graphics and story
"Feb 27, 2013",POSITIVE,"the best superman yet, lots of action and destruction. if you a true superman fan your gonna love Man Of Steel"
"Feb 27, 2013",NEUTRAL,Enjoyable and welcome update to the story but the movie turns into a special effects laden mess which detracts from the well written storyline. Could have been four or five stars!
"Feb 27, 2013",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie, final fight between zod and superman contained too much destruction, the action was thrilling, more downsides are i feel they threw so much stuff at you so quick, and too much building destruction, otherwise a good summer movie"
"Feb 27, 2013",POSITIVE,"As a DC fan I was hoping they would do this right and I wasn't let down. Fights and destruction galore but this is nothing new if you're a fan of the comics. A must see for anyone who has watched anything super hero related previously. It's also a good place to start for those who know nothing about Superman due to the character building and back story.

I dropped it half a star due to how the Lois and Clarke story played out, for me she should never know who he is!"
"Feb 27, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The sound design in this trailer is working! That said, Scruffy Superman is going to be a hard sell for me."
"Feb 27, 2013",POSITIVE,We can't stop going to the theatre to see it. We loved it. Whole family did. And most of our acquaintances did.
"Feb 27, 2013",NEUTRAL,So much action! An imaginatively visioned origin story that sets up a promising future for the franchise. REVISED: doesn't hold up on multiple viewings as well but still a commendable achievement.
"Feb 26, 2013",POSITIVE,"Pretty good! Excellent special effects, and great story. Some may find it slow, but to me it was great because they were laying down the backstory - which they tried to make at realistic as possible. Very entertaining!"
"Feb 26, 2013",POSITIVE,"This movie delivered a new, more mature view of Superman, and truly followed through in its approach. While yes, there were some flaws, overall the movie was a phenomenal heart racer that had my family and me glued the whole time."
"Feb 26, 2013",POSITIVE,Great movie. Well worth watching
"Feb 26, 2013",POSITIVE,"Loved it, and I'll be seeing it a second time on Tuesday. Can't wait to own the blu-ray and see all the extras!"
"Feb 26, 2013",POSITIVE,"This is how a Superman should be. Intense action, spectacular special effects, & remarkable feats of strength. Henry Cavill is worthy of being the next Superman in my books (sorry Brandon Routh. You just didn't cut it). A bit lacking in the character interactions department, but otherwise a thrilling 2.5hrs. Highly recommended."
"Feb 25, 2013",POSITIVE,loved it and lots of action
"Feb 25, 2013",POSITIVE,"An answer to those who were disappointed by Superman Returns. Solid action and a lot of it! Great performances by the cast, not entirely convinced Henry Cavill isn't actually super powerful, lol.  Story structure is off in some places and it needed a little Smallville (the show not the town), as it lacked feeling. Some of the emotional scenes/flashbacks feel more like character study than character development."
"Feb 24, 2013",POSITIVE,Henry was awesome in the Tudors can't wait to see him play Superman Wow!!! He is sexiest man so far to play this role.
"Feb 24, 2013",NEGATIVE,"ANOTHER ONE???! Whip that horse skeleton.......
Next time why not use the money to feed 3rd World kids??"
"Feb 24, 2013",POSITIVE,I can not wait this is going to be awesome
"Feb 24, 2013",POSITIVE,Tales of the Kryptonian never get old.
"Feb 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A huge-scale but somewhat uneven attempt to reboot Superman into a modern day earth. Despite a perfect choice of Henry Cavill for Kryptons finest and some homage-led production design that touches on everything from The Matrix to Alien, the film is let down by an overdose of CGI action that drags the climax down and a less intriguing reason to reinvent a franchise than one would have expected from Nolan, Goyer and Snyder."
"Feb 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Yeah,  this was Hot... Now to watch the 2nd movie, Iron Man 3, on my day off."
"Feb 23, 2013",NEGATIVE,A different take on the Superman back story but interesting nonetheless.
"Feb 23, 2013",POSITIVE,Action-packed movie. So much for secrecy huh...not the best Lois Lane here but Henry Cavill gave justice to his role as Superman. Looking forward to more Superman...Man of Steel sequel in the future by Christopher Nolan.
"Feb 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"Good movie, looking forward to the next one"
"Feb 23, 2013",POSITIVE,I thought it was great
"Feb 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"Lots of carnage, bad death for Zod, not a whole lot of Clark Kent time. It does a good job of showing Superman and Zod adapting to the Earth's atmosphere. Overall the acting was great as well as the CG. Mostly I liked it, I just didn't like Zod's death, as well as Lois' and Clarks (Superman) relationship."
"Feb 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"Not bad, just totally different to all other previous versions of superman"
"Feb 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I think this was a solid 2 hour movie, but they had to add another 28 minutes didn't they."
"Feb 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,all the battle scenes. Very entertaining6 Zack Snyder took the action into a whole new level. and that michael shannon performance. i enjoyed the movie
"Feb 23, 2013",POSITIVE,"I actually regret not seeing this at the cinema but I was not up for all the hassle of going to Bath that day, and the opportunity never really came along again for this film.
I'm glad that I got the dvd of this, it's a lot better than Superman Returns, not disappointed with this film at all.
At first, you may think it's going to be a remake of the original film, but there is more details of the beginning of Superman's life and a few changes throughout have made it more exciting, better than a rehash of the same thing.
Great cast and special effects are pretty good, I don't get the bad reviews because it was well made and the plot didn't have any stupid twists like many films of today.
Some people complained about the film not having any humour, well shit, did any of you watch Superman 3 and 4? That was awful. Besides that, it's not a comedy.
I can't wait for the next film."
"Feb 22, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Man of Steel brought Superman to the screen in a much needed modernization of the classic comic book. The film played with the philosophical ideas of hope and faith in others while doing the right thing. Those ideologies were flawlessly delivered through Russel Crowe, Kevin Costner and even twisted through Michael Shannon's Zod. Henry Cavill delivered a promising performance as the Man of Steel and I hope to see him in other roles in the future. The pacing of the movie was off as the latter half of the movie quickly switches to a ridiculously long action scene that could have been cut down. That being said, the movie did drag and it was definitely felt through the last few minutes. The visual effects were top notch but there was an overuse of the shaky camera style even though it worked in certain scenes. It played with some really good ideas and I believe, finally, gave us a Superman movie worth watching."
"Feb 22, 2013",POSITIVE,"So Good. Thank God! Only had minor issue with it, but great Superman Movie"
"Feb 22, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Chris Nolan should have directed. Zack Snyder made oh so many mistakes. For one thing its entirely heavy on CGI, and it looks beautiful. However, the final 30 minutes felt like an hour of pointless fighting where you KNOW Superman is going to win. The approach was wrong. The film goes through several flashbacks giving backstory to the whole Superman coming to Earth story which...doesnt work. Sure it makes Superman a bit more understandable and relatable, but throughout the whole film there is no development. all he does is put on a flashy suit. It seemed like they made it dark for the sake of being dark. That being said, the story and script were well written, but mishandled. The action sequences were fun at one point, until they were exhausting. The whole movie was just really exhausting."
"Feb 22, 2013",POSITIVE,Snydernism+Nolanism=Awesome Superhero Movie
"Feb 22, 2013",POSITIVE,"First they complain that there wasn't enough action, and now they're complaining there's too much. If you've seen 300, Watchmen, Sucker Punch, then you can expect the same type of filmmaking for ""Man of Steel."" Some dialogue seems rushed, but everything is straight to the point without dragging. The action is massive, and in my opinion, what I've been waiting for. It's not Schindler's List, but it has relentless action and overall, it's put together well. JUST GO SEE IT. Bump the low score."
"Feb 22, 2013",NEUTRAL,Nice movie but they change the story of superman...it has good action sequence..
"Dec 31, 2012",POSITIVE,I thought Man of Steel's good for what it is.
"Dec 31, 2012",POSITIVE,I am hopping to see great cinematography and great composing from Hans Zimmer. I really hope this film would be similar to any of the Dark Knight Trilogy films and that they willshow off my hometown of Chicago.
"Dec 31, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The bombastic, high-flying reboot of the Superman franchise is only a few shades of likability and humanity from  a masterpiece. Fantastic performances, a pulse pounding score, amazing design and breathtaking action  are all bound together by a tightly written script. the only small downside is the very dry and serious atmosphere to the film. It doesn't quite have that shade of likable humanity that Iron Man or The Avengers possessed."
"Dec 31, 2012",POSITIVE,I reckon it's super man by the way
"Dec 31, 2012",POSITIVE,"Great performances, great action, this movie is everything I hoped it would be. It's good to see Superman back on top."
"Dec 31, 2012",POSITIVE,"Action packed with an incredibly tight focus but also with  impressive CGI but also a talented cast that aims itself towards presenting the characters with a great level of new flair. Another one of the best things that ""Man of Steel"" has is an intimidating and appealing villain with Michael Shannon's performance as General Zod. Overall, a great revival of Superman for a new audience of the current decade"
"Dec 31, 2012",NEUTRAL,"So my initial reaction as the credits rolled was ""Well that was good."" I got in my car and began driving home and the closer I got the more I realized that it wasn't. I liked the movie, but the characters, story, editing, direction, lighting, pacing, everything was off. It's the best attempt at a Superman movie to date and Henry Cavil did a pretty good job but I feel like they missed out on a lot of things. Also, I'm completely sick of these ""first person/shit flying at the screen"" type scenes. They look horrible in 2D, knock it off. 

My overall reaction after re-watching the movie is WOW THINGS BLOW UP A LOT. I only wish that the end credit read ""Directed by: Zach 'subtle' Snyder."""
"Dec 31, 2012",POSITIVE,This is a great movie. How this only has a 57% is beyond me. What were the 43% of movie critics watching? This movie is every bit as good as any of the Batman movies or the Marvel movies. They hit a home run with this.
"Dec 31, 2012",POSITIVE,Very good story line and I love Henry Cavill as Superman. This is the best adaptation ever!
"Dec 31, 2012",NEUTRAL,"I don't know what these critics are smoking. This is the first blockbuster movie this year to not leave you wanting.

Is it perfect? Absolutely not. Is it great? Sometimes. It's mostly just very, very good though. From the casting to the Art direction to the setup for the sure to be sequel. 

I just hope they cut back on the phony film grain and desaturation next time and give us a villain we haven't seen in the movies before."
"Dec 31, 2012",NEGATIVE,"I think I'm too old for it, flat screenplay, photography and 3D weak.

Join Dragon Ball and District 9 scenes with two assholes fighting knowing that no one will get hurt.

It reminded me of why Batman is my favorite hero.

Fucking boring"
"Dec 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The visuals of the krypton's were very good. Was missing an element at the end other wise good. The hard element of Superman, working at Daily Planet seemed forced."
"Dec 30, 2012",POSITIVE,"They couldn't have picked a better Superman, Henri Cavill did super! The fight scenes were just as promised....when people with this kind of power fight, sh*t is gonna get busted and people are gonna die... 3D at the movies is gonna make it tough to watch 470 times at home when I buy the DVD....but I'll survive!! Go.see.this.movie."
"Dec 30, 2012",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed it in spite of what everyone else was saying about it.  My only complaint is that, it's a little too long."
"Dec 30, 2012",POSITIVE,"Despite negative reviews, I loved this movie. I thought the changes made were perfect for today's political and social climate while I believed it maintained its original heroic charm. While others disliked the realism, I found it simply added more dimension to the movie and Superman's character"
"Dec 30, 2012",POSITIVE,A very good film. Not as good as the Batman films but still a good action film. Felt the story lacked a bit though
"Dec 30, 2012",POSITIVE,"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Now that being said, I thought this movie was fantastic. Best superhero action since the Avengers and dare I say better. I am a die hard Superman fan and I was very pleased with this movie and all of its actors. Henry Cavil did a great job as Superman. The only thing of him I would have like to have seen more of would have been him as Clark at the planet. There were a couple of nods to Superman 2 during the end fight with Zod that I found great that I don't think many people have picked up on. All in all 5 out of 5. And to the critics, I ask did you see the same movie as I? Also while I am also a fan of Superman Returns... how in the hell is that fresher than this. Please go rewatch that and then this again and think about your review..."
"Dec 30, 2012",POSITIVE,"The best example of Superman on film, period."
"Dec 30, 2012",POSITIVE,"Don't go into the theater expecting to see a rehash of any previous picture.  You are not going to get it.  This is a completely different MAN OF STEEL.  Honestly, one I wasn't expecting. Amidst the heavily ladened SFX and CGI film, there is a thought provoking message, one I thoroughly enjoyed.

Clark/Kal-El's journey is told in flashback as he is guided by his human father, Jonathan Kent, played brilliantly by Kevin Costner.  Russell Crowe fills the shoes as Jor-El admirably.  The performance by Michael Shannon as General Zod had me feeling a tinge of sympathy for him, if even for a nanosecond. 

The showing I attended was filled with fans of all ages - even a father with his very young son both wearing a Superman cape.  Although, I don't think this was the ""Superman"" Dad expected to see.

I can only hope future films with this MAN OF STEEL will continue on the same path."
"Dec 30, 2012",POSITIVE,Nolan - Snyder - Zimmer Combo! Comes with strong plot  & jawdropping special fx which never stops to amaze ! Reason it's not 5/5 is simply because it's ssuperman
"Dec 30, 2012",NEGATIVE,Poor plot carpy superman movie as usual.
"Dec 30, 2012",POSITIVE,"Superman doesn't really become ""Superman"" until the very end.  For this reason it is one of my favorite origin stories on film."
"Dec 30, 2012",POSITIVE,"awesome film, loved it all the way through 9/10"
"Dec 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,"From what I've seen in the trailer along with the awesome  directors at the helm it actually looks like they put some $ into this movie ,only because they saw what the marvel universe movies brought to the box office.this could be the real turning point for The DC comics universe because if they actually put the right directors together and the money to back it up DC could become as successful as marvel if they plan and work it right....superman delivered as well as I expected"
"Dec 30, 2012",NEGATIVE,"Words cannot express how I disappointed I am with this dreadful cold reimaging of Superman.

The film was an hour too long, a thousand building collapses too far and devoid of any of Supermans original heartwarming humour. They managed to make you care very little for Superman, Lois Lane or earth for that matter.

The only thing decent in the film was Russells Crowes role of Superman father. It was good to see him bring back his inner maximus.

Before I finish here is a little parental warning for you. This film is long, is darker, does have a lot of explosions and violence, so probably not the place to take a three year old who will scream the cinema roof down every five minutes. Do yourselves and the audience a favour and leave them at home for this one. Better still give it a miss completely and wait for the next reboot, due probably in June 2014!"
"Dec 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,"As far as popcorn blockbuster action movies go, this pulls no superman punches! In some ways it's pretty damn awesome and on repeat plays there will certainly be people shouting ""shut up, I love this bit!"""
"Dec 30, 2012",POSITIVE,Best of the Superman movies to date.
"Dec 30, 2012",POSITIVE,An interesting take on Superman but a film with an unusual structure - the flashbacks outstaying what feels like their natural endpoint. Some strong performances but one feels this is all just set up for what should hopefully be a stronger sequel. And said sequel should have Jimmy Olsen in it.
"Dec 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,ehhhh....superman is over done..they need to stop
"Dec 30, 2012",NEGATIVE,Only good for the man candy.
"Dec 30, 2012",POSITIVE,"HATERS... I ONLY have THIS to say to you... KNEEL BEFORE ZOD (and then you kneel before ME, and EVERYONE ELSE who LOVES this movie)...!!!!! NOW, this even INCLUDES the critics that did NOT like this movie... 56%...? SERIOUSLY! THIS SHOULD be in the 60s AT LEAST...! COME ON, PEOPLE...!"
"Dec 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,Loved the back story. Too much Transformer stuff.
"Dec 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,This easily erases the memory of Superman Returns.  Zod was Ok but the 80's version villains would have fit well in this movie instead to give it a bit more humour.
"Dec 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,"I liked it... great action and a good spin/evolution of the classic story... however, in the words off another review I read, there's not much fun or joy in this movie."
"Dec 29, 2012",POSITIVE,Superman movie we deserved!!
"Dec 29, 2012",NEGATIVE,"A hairy, apathetic, and murderous Superman throws other super-humans through countless buildings to the delight of no one."
"Dec 29, 2012",NEUTRAL,A little too much ambition made it a little unfocused. Still a good reboot and worth the ticket.
"Dec 29, 2012",POSITIVE,"Looks like this one is gonna rock the last Superman movie left me wanting for more, like craving a good steak and settling for a hamburger"
"Dec 29, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The first half was really good.  Cavill did a good job portraying the good natured all American Midwestern boy tortured by the weight of his destiny.  The last half was an exhausting hour long climax.  By the end, I honestly wanted someone to win the fight so I could go home rather than because I cared about the story."
"Dec 29, 2012",POSITIVE,"great action, great superman, lacked humour, stamp was a better zod and hatcher a better lois, however still very enjoyable."
"Dec 29, 2012",POSITIVE,Great movie but I wasn't impressed with Henry Cavill as Superman or Amy Adams as Lois. I felt as though something was missing from them. Maybe it's me. Otherwise great movie.
"Dec 29, 2012",NEUTRAL,Michael Shannon was terrific.
"Dec 29, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Director Zack Snyder and Screenwriter David S. Goyer along with producer Christopher Nolan have brought Superman back to the big screen a few shorts years after the Superman Returns debacle with ""Man Of Steel"".

I am not a Superman fan at all. In fact he might be my least favorite superhero, that would kind of go for any superhero that is overly powerful. You like rooting for a hero, but it is hard to root for them when he basically outmatches the villain in every way. So have to throw those notions out the window. Whether I personally enjoy Superman doesn't, what matters to me is a good a movie. In some way I got what I wanted and in other ways I did not.

Man Of Steel falls in the same trap for me that The Amazing Spider-Man did, if not in different ways. In TASM we got a rebooted origin story to a film series that gave us an origin story less than 10 years ago, and origin stories are already tough to do in the first place because you are so restricted to telling that story that you really can't delve into a more meaningful story. Man of Steel is the Superman origin story, it major origin story problem is that everyone knows it. Even I, as a non fan who never read a comic, or seen a movie STILL knew the origin story of Superman just because the character is THAT well known. The story of Man Of Steel never really struck me as exciting or gripping just because I felt like I knew what came next.

There is no doubt that the Zack Snyder effect made this movie and the Superman world feel MUCH bigger, and it looked the part. The visual effects were glorious and kudos to the studio(s) that handled them they knocked it out of the park. From the fall of Krypton, to the final battle between Supes and Zod, we got more than our share of breath taking visuals and big old explosions.

But is often the case with Goyer and Snyder I felt like there was a lot of uneven dialog and performances. Goyer while well known for his work in the recent Batman trilogy (although I thought The Dark Knight Rises while the most recent, was the worst of the three) he has also penned Jumper, and the ungodly terrible Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance. Zack Snyder on the other hand has a reputation in Hollywood for producing visual treats like 300, Watchmen, and Sucker Punch. And while I enjoyed 300 and Watchmen there is no denying that Snyder often does a George Lucas and tends to pay more attention to his visuals than his performances which led to uneven acting in all his recent films and the less said about Sucker Punch the better.

Man Of Steel suffers from this somewhat. I liked Henry Cavill as Superman. I thought he looked the part, and was largely a good fit but I didn't see sense any charisma or charm, and the same kind of went for Amy Adams' portrayal of Lois Lane. They both kind of felt muted at times. I also felt Michael Shannon's General Zod was at times a very good bad guy, but at other times he felt WAY over the top (too much for my liking), and at points even fell into cliche bad guy territory. I did enjoy Russel Crowe, Diane Lane, and Kevin Costner's brief outings in this movie and I kind of wish they had more screen time.

Whether or not this is another case of Snyder syndrome or whether it had more to do with with being stuck in ""origin story mode""......only time will tell as it relates to that, and I am sure we will see another film.

Is this a good Superman movie? I can't really say. It is the first Superman movie that I actually enjoyed even with its flaws. Ultimately though for me it is in a strange middle ground. Not as dark as the Nolanverse Batman, but yet not as charming and vibrant as the Marvel films. I guess for me I would place on the same level as Ed Norton's Hulk film above Iron Man 2, and WAY above The Green Lantern.....

I am curious to see if DC can step it up for round two."
"Dec 29, 2012",POSITIVE,A great look at the superman story.
"Dec 29, 2012",POSITIVE,"Soundtrack fabulous! Movie was intriguing and well constructed, epic action sequence in last 30 minutes."
"Dec 29, 2012",POSITIVE,"Fantastic reimagining  of a well known story. Man of Steel impresses and excites at every turn. The low critics score is further evidence of their increasing irrelevance and just how out of touch they are with modern cinema. There is subtle humor for those paying attention, and the characters felt very 3-dimensional- something it's predecessor was severely lacking.  I don't recommend seeing Man of Steel.... I recommend seeing Man of Steel multiple times."
"Dec 29, 2012",NEGATIVE,"Too angry, sad and disappointed to review."
"Dec 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,Man of steel heightens all your senses with its superior special effects but lacks its originality. It aims galaxies away and the seriousness of its entirety hurts its own story. Man of steel just leaves you without a true hero.
"Dec 28, 2012",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie ever made since the Christopher Reeve era.And possibly the best movie in 2013...and it's better than the disappointing Iron Man 3 movie
"Dec 28, 2012",POSITIVE,Best updated version of the Superman mythos hands down. Those who dislike it are too attached to the pre-crisis version of the character or the Donner films.
"Dec 28, 2012",POSITIVE,"Wow. Epic. Soars above all other comic book movies. This was a great reinvention of Superman that finally shows you his world, his parents in greater detail with some great flashbacks to him growing up and becoming the man he ends up being. The performances are wonderful with not one fault and yes maybe some characters could do with some more screen time but that will be explored in the sequel. What ppl must remember is that this is telling kal-el/ Clark kents story of how he came to earth. The action is amazing that no other comic book movie can better, it's loud with some serious smackdowns taking place. Effects are some of the best I have seen and the music is top notch. Forget the Christopher reeve movies when you watch this, that was great for its time but this is really how it should be made. Forget what some dumb American critics are saying as I think they got confused with watching iron man 3. Go watch this absolutely awesome!"
"Dec 28, 2012",POSITIVE,"With some cliche films, and a interesting adaption from Brian singer, Man of steel has given the hero some much need depth. Zack synder has taken the hero to a whole new level with a great cast of characters, great visuals and some emotional dialogue that wrapped me in. Man of steel may not appeal to some viewers and it is not perfect but it is defiantly the reboot that is needed to give it that extra kick."
"Dec 28, 2012",POSITIVE,"By far and away my most anticipated film of 2013; Man of Steel did not underwhelm. This is the gritty, realistic superman that I was dying to see. Yes, Man of Steel does things we usually would not expect of him; but that makes him a realistic, grounded, and human-like superhero."
"Dec 28, 2012",POSITIVE,"As a Batman fan I must say...I LOVED THIS MOVIE!! idk what else to say. First and foremost the acting in the film was great, Henry Cavill as Superman was real solid. He embodied the character, you truly got the sense of hope from and and that he generally is a good guy. Amy Adams as always did great as Lois, she had the attitude and her chemistry with Cavill was superb. everyone was great, but for me my stand out performance has to be Michael Shannon as Zod. He stayed true to himself, not mimicking Terrance Stamp in anyway, but leaving his own mark on the character. You truly got the sense that he would do ANYTHING for his people. As far as action is concerned, its Zack Snyder, so you know this movie has great action sequences. The fight between Superman and Zod was mind blowing to me. All in all this movie is truly amazing, I can't wait to see what's next for the Man of Steel and I hope to see him and the Dark Knight on the big screen together!!!"
"Dec 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Overrated. The first half is very choppy. Sometimes the dialogue is massively incongruous, and superman doesn't have near enough amount of words. The actions sequences no matter how pleasing to the eye do drag on and feel repetitive. The character of Lois is very tedious. Of course every film has it's conveniences but this films conveniences are way to unrealistic to pass as believable. 
It didn't make $1bn because it didn't deserve $1bn .
It wasn't met with critical acclaim that accompanies almost every comic book movie because it didn't deserve it. 
It's worth a watch but isn't exactly the flying start to the DC Cinematic Universe that Iron Man was to the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"Dec 28, 2012",NEGATIVE,"I suppose this movie will bring another generation to Superman which IS a good thing.  For me from the original Superhero generation, however, it was too special effects driven and too violent.  Hopefully, the ones to follow will have more story line."
"Dec 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The build toward the Justice League begins, with no build."
"Dec 28, 2012",POSITIVE,"being a hardcore superman fan for my whole life I had high standards going into this movie.
it excelled in casting,acting and visual effects!the story line was exciting and well written.
it was riddled with odd marketing in movie as everyone had nokia lumias and one of the main battle scenes was near a sears store (both nokia and sears sponsered the movie) it contained a frequent use of mild language as the word DICK was used infrequently but more than once.

above all it is a perfect movie and brings back superman with a more realistic light.
Watch out marvel because DC is back in the game!"
"Dec 27, 2012",POSITIVE,Worth seeing! Missed the classic Superman Theme song! Don't know why they left that out?
"Dec 27, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Wasn't expecting much from this film, but I didn't think it was as bad as some people said it was. It had its moments and the art direction was somewhat creative. It was clearly director Zack Snyder's vision of Superman which wasn't true to form. So if you were expecting the traditional man of steel, you might be disappointed. The film does fall short on a few different levels but not so much as to condemn it because it doesn't live up to the hype. The story is based on the graphic novel ""Superman:Birthright,"" so it's pretty obvious where a lot the ideas were pulled from. It's a comic book movie for heaven's sake so how good is it really suppose to be considering the material that it derived from."
"Dec 27, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Ok, the critics were harsh on this one and I get why. But if you're not a pretentious, nit-picking joy kill then you'll enjoy it. First, this superman is hot, you'll see. Second, it did capture a bit of that gritty realistic Christopher Nolan's Batman vibe (which we all appreciate) with the background and lead-up. The storyline was concise and clear, some corniness, but also a big cast. The only negative was a 20 min block near the end and some of the insanely over the top destruction, but c'mon; it's a bloody superhero movie. All in all rotten tomatoes can suck it and I give it a solid, slightly forgiving, 75/100. *hot, bearded man points*"
"Dec 27, 2012",POSITIVE,Awesome!!.. Soooooo good! Loved it :-)
"Dec 27, 2012",POSITIVE,"Thought it was excellent - very gritty not too ""comicy"". A good start to a new superman!"
"Dec 27, 2012",POSITIVE,Best version of all.
"Dec 27, 2012",POSITIVE,"What a great summer movie to look forward to... Yes I know we just started winter , I'm just saying... :)"
"Dec 27, 2012",POSITIVE,"A different take of the superman movie compared to the others that's out there. The tone and feeling of the movie drew me into their world. It doesn't give me the feeling that it's just another superhero movie. It does give me a darker tone than most superheroes film. 
I also think the scenes are well paced and connected too."
"Dec 27, 2012",NEUTRAL,"A bold adaptation that shows the best Superman action in a looong time. Epic music, great actors, heartfelt drama, and thoughtful cinematography."
"Dec 27, 2012",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie ever.
"Dec 27, 2012",POSITIVE,"A movie that is packed with lots of action, Much better then the other movie superman returns."
"Dec 27, 2012",POSITIVE,Looks like it's going to be the best Superman pretty much ever made
"Dec 27, 2012",NEGATIVE,You have Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner as your fathers and you turn out this dull? How is that possible? The third act is far far too long and far far too smash smash smash.
"Dec 27, 2012",POSITIVE,"As many critics and users are saying that Man of Steel has no emotion or humour , I feel the complete opposite as I cried twice during the film and laughed hysterically throughout. This is the superman film that I have waited for! The beginning and end of the film ( no spoilers ) offer a brilliantly visual spectacle of the dying krypton and the epic super brawls. One of the few attempts to use CGI on such a massive scale that is actually pulled off successfully. But what makes this film truly great is watching our new Clark/kal grow up and watch him as he is shadowed away from society to hide his burdens. The connection between Clark and the Kent's, and Kal and his long lost father jor not only expand the story but actually do something that very few adaptations have done, made us care about the man of steel. Only criticism.... the end battle will leave you with a migraine , but nevertheless a migraine worth paying for."
"Dec 27, 2012",POSITIVE,"Too much shaky cam. Unrealistic love story. Too much damage to buildings, and Kal-El probably killed some inoccent lives in it. Despite these flaws, the cast is great, the story is good, the score and the special effects are great. This is a decent Superman movie and a decent movie. It can make you dizzy, but you'll have fun."
"Dec 26, 2012",NEGATIVE,"*A Review of Man of Steel: Go but Know They Still Haven't Figured It Out*

What I mean is, Hollywood still hasn't figured out Superman for the big screen. Not even with the vision Zach Snyder or the characters of Christopher Nolan could save this movie. Let's start from the style standpoint. Whedon was given a lot of flak for his over use of mirror shots in the Avengers. If that's the case, Snyder uses the flashback way to much. So much so, it's discombobulating. It begins to detract more than it adds to the movie. You almost wish that it followed a linear time line when you've seen it more than half way through the movie. How do you start a movie with a woman in labor? I know they did that on Star Trek, but it was secondary to the best first fifteen minutes in movies ever. I also understand that Snyder wanted to show the Krytonian world, but he shows a dualistic world - one that is immensely high tech, yet people are riding around on animals like it's Avatar. 

But let's talk about Superman. The first thing that terribly wrong is that Snyder and Nolan approach Superman from this point of being orphaned and the last of his kind (which he's not since General Zod et al are alive; not a spoiler, you knew that already.) Not only had that been done an innumerable amount of times in the past (including with Superman Returns; after all, that's why he's returning), it's just not Superman's character. He's an eternal optimist. He doesn't brood. He doesn't despair. That's why his ""S"" it's a symbol of hope. This story of internal struggle works well as a television show on the WB. It does not work on the big screen anymore. People want to see a different kind of Superman. 

We don't want to see Superman fishing. We don't want to see him with a beard (how does he even shave? His hair is like high tensile steel?) We definitely don't want to see him steal clothes. He's not Bruce banner after hulking out. Don't get me wrong: Henry Cavill makes the best Superman yet. But like Routh before him, suffers from a poor story and inconsistent plot, carried along by some of the worst fiction and made up scenarios I've ever seen. Supposedly, Superman loses his powers on the Kryptonian ship, not because there's kyptonite on there but because of the normalized Kryptonian atmosphere? That's on the same level as the metachlorites (or whatever they're called in Star Wars to explain the Force.) 

They spend so much time retelling the Superman story that Zod is left picking up the scraps of time to insufficient levels that his character is neither sinister enough nor evil enough to dispose. He's actually being noble. The actor is more sinister in Premium Rush than he is here. Because of that, there's zero time to develop the Lois relationship but after a couple of hand holds, we're supposed to believe it's okay for them to be affectionate by the end? These are just some issues coupled with a fight scene that rivals the length of the mind numbing fight scenes in every Matrix movie after the first one. We get it. They're equal in strength. 

That's not to say the movie doesn't have a couple of glimpses of brilliance. But Snyder and Nolan were so caught up in trying to do something no other Superman movie has done that they completely miss the opportunity to capitalize. But go see it because it's Superman. It's on par with the rest of them. I feel like I need to write a script and submit it because these Hollywood guys are clearly out of touch with the average movie goer."
"Dec 26, 2012",POSITIVE,I have never been a superman fan but have to say was very impressed with this movie.
"Dec 26, 2012",POSITIVE,"Monster comeback, this is what Superman is supposed to be like. Only thing he was made look too much like a rookie."
"Dec 26, 2012",POSITIVE,A good start off and orgin story to the Man of Steel series and possibly the DC movie Universe.
"Dec 26, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Although not perfect, Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan that is real, exciting, and spectacular. One of Snyder's better movies."
"Dec 26, 2012",POSITIVE,"This Modern Adaptation is unlike anything we have ever seen, you'll forget Reeve and Routh, krypton is amazing, action is satisfying ill admit some characters could have used more development but a huge henry cavill performance makes up for it. Action is great and we will want multiple sequels, this is DC's last chance and I think they've got it. Compare it to Batman Begins with action better than The Avengers bring on JLA!"
"Dec 26, 2012",POSITIVE,Happy to say the movie worked and the reboot was successful. Yes there are several holes in the story and I would change a good number of things. The look and feel was just right and action was on the level of expectations. Looking forward to the next movie really exploring the Man of Steel's moral values and his ability to make impossible decisions.
"Dec 26, 2012",POSITIVE,OhMerrrGaaaaaah Superman <3 Really good movie. I love it!!!!
"Dec 26, 2012",NEUTRAL,They chose a very good looking man to play superman! :)
"Dec 26, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Coming into it with very high expectations, Man of Steel is unfortunately a let down. It lacks the much needed excitement in this big shot superhero film."
"Dec 26, 2012",POSITIVE,Awesome action. Awesome story. Awesome movie. Best Superman movie of all time.
"Dec 26, 2012",POSITIVE,Simply put...I CANNOT WAIT!!!
"Dec 26, 2012",POSITIVE,This film puts Superman back on the map and Henry Cavill certainly repairs the damage that was done by Brandon Routh's limp performance. Actually enjoyed this film more the second time that I watched it.
"Dec 26, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Zack Snyder has made me appreciate how well developed, wonderful and classical Superman 1, 2 , 3 and 4 are."
"Dec 26, 2012",NEUTRAL,"In the effort to make our fanboy dreams come true, something seems to have gotten lost in the translation. Personally, finally seeing the legendary iconic fist fight between titans on the big screen was beyond satisfying, frenetic as it was. The players were fine, Adams, Crowe"
"Dec 25, 2012",POSITIVE,"The other critics are right. Man Of Steel is not The Dark Knight. Man Of Steel is not Iron Man 3. Man Of Steel is not The Avengers. Man Of Steel suceeds  in the fact that it does not try to be any of those films. This film is about  Truth, justice and the american way and it still gives us a refreshing take on a an american Icon and america's first and greatest superhero. Snyder, Nolan, and  Goyer have returned a sense of adventure, wonder and action to the superhero genre and in the process have revitalized a franchise needing a new start. Superman is back and he is here to stay."
"Dec 25, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Good rehashing of original superman plot, good new superman, sadly the action (fights) were just a bit too hectic for my taste...Amy Adams is actually pretty good as Lois and Russell Crowe is great as Jor-El"
"Dec 25, 2012",POSITIVE,I Hope That They Bring Back Some Of The Comic Superman Back In the Light!
"Dec 25, 2012",POSITIVE,"El reinicio esperado del personaje... Era un reto muy grande reimaginar el personaje desde el punto de vista conceptual y art√≠stico y la formula Nolan/Snyder consiguen darle el aspecto correcto. Introspectiva y √©pica... Hans Zimmer logr√≥ captar el esp√≠ritu de la pel√≠cula con su banda sonora. Una historia bien construida, consistente con el mensaje y todo los personajes cumplen perfectamente con sus roles. Sin embargo, se percibe la necesidad de mostrar una pel√≠cula que siga el mismo esquema empleado por la trilog√≠a del caballero oscuro. Solo espero que en la secuela haya mayor participaci√≥n de Snyder como director y nos muestre mas de su estilo que lo hizo famoso"
"Dec 25, 2012",POSITIVE,one of the best movies of the summer
"Dec 25, 2012",POSITIVE,"Loved every minute, Henry Cavill is perfect!"
"Dec 25, 2012",NEUTRAL,It didn't feel like Superman.
"Dec 25, 2012",POSITIVE,"Amazing. Story was a little rushed I'm favor of some action, but this is the Superman movie everyone was waiting for.The cast was perfect top to bottom, the strongest possibly being Crowe and Costner. All the visual effects were perfect. The hand held camera throughout was a little much add uneasy to watch at some points.But the feel of being right in the action was amazing.I can't wait to see it again and again and again."
"Dec 25, 2012",POSITIVE,Was a good movie but needed to be 2 movies one to intro and the other for the villains
"Dec 25, 2012",POSITIVE,"Here we go, Incredible!! Can't wait for the second part to come out.."
"Dec 25, 2012",NEUTRAL,It felt so long! I think it was pretty good other than the extremely long fight scenes that made the movie feel so long. But some people enjoy that...
"Dec 25, 2012",POSITIVE,"Epic film. Finally a Superman action packed film. CGI was outstanding [Krypton/final 45 minutes of film]. Score was great from composer Hans Zimmer. Cavill was amazing as Superman. Needless to say, I fricken LOVED it!"
"Oct 19, 2012",NEGATIVE,"""Man of Steel""     5 / 10     DISAPPOINTMENT

     You would thing with Zach Snyder's history of making good action movies and Christopher Nolan's gritty, realistic approach to hero movies, you'd get a phenomenal movie. I was highly disappointed with this movie. 

     Every superhero movie needs a bunch of action scenes, but there is a line and ""Man of Steel"" definitely went overboard. On a side note for the action scenes, none of them had Snyder's trademark slow-mo. The movie felt rushed and there wasnt much development between action scenes, its like all the director wanted to do was throw a bunch of action in there. 

     I felt that most of the characters were fairly cast, however, none of them were allowed to reach their potential in their characters. There was absolutely no chemistry between Clark and Lois. Russel Crowe's scenes as Jor-El all felt extremely rushed. Kevin Coster's Johnathan Kent hardly got any screen time for being such a pivotal character in Clark's life. Last but not least is Henry Cavill, he may have the looks, but doesnt have the acting potential to be Superman (save for that one controversial scene, he did very well)

     I believe this is the worst origin story I've recently seen for a superhero. Warner Bros. is a greedy industry, all they want to do is make money, even if the art of movies is lost, so long as people see it, they dont care. That is why the latter 2 Burton-produced Batman movies failed critically.

     My advice, dont see this movie, wait until it gets rebooted in 20 years."
"Oct 19, 2012",POSITIVE,"I liked this one, probably more than the previous versions!"
"Oct 19, 2012",POSITIVE,Really enjoy this take on the superman franchise
"Oct 18, 2012",NEGATIVE,Not that good. Fight scenes are intense but the continuity of the story is all over the place. Seems like there's a flash back every ten minutes. The actor playing General Zod annoyed me and didn't feel like a villain. Watch at your own risk.
"Oct 18, 2012",NEUTRAL,"It was a decent flick, but it fell way short of the potential that the trailers tease at. Overall a disappointment for me. Definitely not one I'd pay to see twice"
"Oct 18, 2012",POSITIVE,An amazing take on the iconic Superman from start to finish. Henry Cavill is amazing as the Man of Steel and Michael Shannon is definitely a great bad guy as General Zod in Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan's superhero epic that'll leave you wanting more!!!
"Oct 18, 2012",NEUTRAL,Movie goers a warning -dont xpect something as nolans progenical batman .Snyder does a good job heightening our expectations  to the end..
"Oct 18, 2012",POSITIVE,"Let me start off by saying that this is easily the best movie of the year. 
Each character had an appropriate amount of screen time and was also perfectly cast. 
Zack Snyder, David Goyer & Christopher Nolan nailed it. Snyder's choice of going handheld with the film was brilliant as it perfectly complimented his visual style of directing. 
Man of Steel was an incredible retelling of Superman's origins and how he deals with his human/kryptonian sides. 
Cannot wait to watch this film over and over again. It is going to be extremely difficult for any future superhero film to outdo Man of Steel. Now time to look forward to the sequel!"
"Oct 18, 2012",POSITIVE,Only reason it 4 stars is because faora wasn't it it more that plus no John Williams theme music
"Oct 18, 2012",POSITIVE,It was awesome √∞~¬±√∞~¬±√∞~¬±√∞~¬±√∞~¬±√∞~¬±√∞~¬±√∞'?√∞'?√∞'?√∞'?√∞'?√∞'?√∞'?
"Oct 18, 2012",POSITIVE,"If you get a chance to see it, go.  I went into this understanding that it was a reimagined version and think that the visual detail of the film was pretty cool.  The plot probably could've been done a hair bit better, but had a lot of interesting aspects to it."
"Oct 17, 2012",POSITIVE,best superhero movie so far.....epic!
"Oct 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,"There were things about this movie that I loved, including the fact that they chose to deviate from the usual, superhero origin story, in the fact that they chose flashbacks as the method for telling the story.  The movie was visually stunning.  That said, it didn't have a sense of humor about itself, at all, and I didn't find myself really caring about any of the characters.  Better than Green Lantern, by a lot...but not in the same world as the Avengers or the Dark Knight."
"Oct 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,not as enjoyable the 2nd time...sad
"Oct 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,Solid cinematography. They did what they could with a super hero that is perfect.
"Oct 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Darker, and more serious. I like it."
"Oct 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,"As much as I tried to enjoy Man of Steel (and I did to a point), there was something clearly missing.  Now I know most people will compare this film to the Christopher Reeve iconic Superman films, and that's all right.  I came into this film open minded.  But I could not help but feel there was something missing.  What was missing was the lack of emotional attachment that I had felt from the other Superman movies.  I know setting this movie apart and disengaging it from what those films were was the direction this movie was clearly trying to go for.  You can sense it and feel it when watching this movie just the same as you felt from watching Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy.  Though more light hearted and heart felt in some parts of the film, I still can not help but feel the ominous darkness being told in this tale.  Not that its a bad thing but that's what sets it apart and it holds its own.  With that being said the film doesn't fail in the action department.  In fact it tries too hard.  Marvels The Avengers clearly set the bar last year with Superhero films and you cant help but feel Man of Steel is definitely trying to make its mark as well with its CGI action scenes.  Not comparing the scenes but we all know now that the bar is set and all these kinds of movies want to hit that mark.  Man of Steel over does that...and not in a subtle way either.
The actors were engaging.  Henry Cavill nails the Clark Kent/Superman...though he doesn't set them apart in this film (he plays them as one in the same).  In this Superman he is obviously the Clark Kent Superman...not either or.  Desperately trying to find himself thoughout the story which I am sure they will expand on that in the next film (and yes their will be more in case you haven't read the news).  
I loved Amy Adams as Lois Lane.  She brings something new to the table and never seen before in Lois.  A human side to her.  In the other films she was over working, humorous and at times (Superman Returns) not very relatable.  Adams and Cavill work very well together for this iconic duo and i'm looking forward to seeing how this relationship will blossom in the next film.  
Zod (played by Michael Shannon) was defintely the ying to Supermans yang.  Methodical and straight homicidal!  The perfect combination you would want in a villain.  
And of course the class acts...Russel Crowe (Jor-El) Diane Lane (Martha Kent) and Kevin Costner (Jonathan Kent).  These three in the film bring that high class of acting to supportive roles that is not only needed but very much wanted.  Heartbreaking, heartfelt and above all gave guidance to the main characters which was exactly expected from these actors and they never fail to deliver.  It brought this movie to another level...moreso than the Dark Knight films.
Director Zach Snyder and screenwriter David Goyer (The Dark Knight trilogy) did something here that has not been attempted by another Superman film before.  And I welcome the change.  We were so use to the mythos of the character and so in love with the other films that we have forgotten that Superman (though an American icon before these films) is his own character.  Not one actor can be this character forever though as much as we loved the past it was time to move on.  Snyder and Goyer do this perfectly.  Some critics will say oh Snyder just clipped together 40 five minute trailers together.  Or the action scenes were over powering.  Or the direction was what I expected.  But here's what I say...take the movie for what it is.  A straight up Superhero action and drama movie.  Nothing more, nothing less.  If you can deal with that...then it was worth the price of a theater ticket.  And it was!"
"Oct 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,"It's a great movie, perfect beginning to a hopefully long series!"
"Oct 16, 2012",POSITIVE,"I can't wait for Thursday!!! Love amazing, crazy good."
"Oct 16, 2012",POSITIVE,Incredible! Critics are wrong this time.
"Oct 16, 2012",POSITIVE,"Zack Snyder marries Hans Zimmer's brilliant film score with the non-stop action resulting in an insane amount of Nerd Tears! Emotional and action-packed! Zack Snyder is a very visual director. He got his own style, i mean if you've seen 300 or Watchmen, you would know what im talking about. Great supporting cast and of course Henry Caville is a likeable superman and very relatable. Just see it and prepare to be wowed. Skip the 3D because it was shot with handheld camera which cannot be converted into 3D, I do not know why Christopher Nolan agreed to it. 4 1/2 stars out of 5"
"Oct 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,A very different take on Superman than what I grew up watching but all and all not bad.
"Oct 15, 2012",POSITIVE,THE most awaited for 2013!!!! It's going to be AWESOME!!! Comic Con trailer just showed how great this will be!!!
"Oct 15, 2012",POSITIVE,Hell of a lot better than the last 1
"Oct 15, 2012",POSITIVE,It was everything I wanted it to be.
"Oct 15, 2012",NEGATIVE,I give up............................
"Oct 14, 2012",POSITIVE,finally. a action packed superman. loved it. now i cant wait to see another and a link to the justice league.
"Oct 14, 2012",POSITIVE,A nice action movie with  Grazie and special effects √∞~
"Oct 14, 2012",POSITIVE,"Zack Snyder and the Dark Knight team bring a huge dose of reality and harsh, awestruck action to the Man Of Steel. 
Leave behind everything of Christopher Reeve's Superman legacy and prepare for a tale of alienation, loss, dilemma and hope. Then you will enjoy this."
"Oct 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,the best superman movie (thats not saying much) but superman doesnt even talk that much it feels like he isnt even the star of the movie also the movie is paced very poorly it dragged a ton near the end and it felt 2 and a half hrs
"Oct 14, 2012",POSITIVE,"Lacked a little back story, but overall thought this was a solid film. Critics are being too harsh. Why this has a 55% on the rotten tomato meter is beyond me."
"Oct 14, 2012",POSITIVE,"Not a fan of Michael Shannon in this at all. It feels kind of long, but there is enough story to keep you going. I really liked it, I hope there are more to come."
"Oct 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Henry Cavill was an excellent choice for Superman, and I really enjoyed the early scenes on Krypton, and the scenes with Clark/Kal trying to save people on the rig, in the school bus and at the bar. Once the main story got going, however, it started to lose me, and my interest levels got lower. Even the final fight scenes failed to grab me - it was only at the very end that I enjoyed it as much as I had in the first half hour."
"Oct 13, 2012",POSITIVE,"Best superman/hero movie yet. I loved that the movie maintains a serious mood the entire time, unlike its marvel counterparts."
"Oct 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,"This is a very very different Superman movie from the one i grew up loving. To begin with I struggled to get my head around that fact and i felt that it held me back from enjoying what this was.

This movie is all out sci-fi and focuses a lot more on the ""Alien"" aspect of Kal-El and him choosing sides between his Kryptonian heritage and the human life he has grown up with.

The Krypton sequence could have easily been something out of a Star Wars movie or something like that it feels that epic and different. No more single Ice City. To top it off, the role of Jor-El is fleshed out a lot more in this movie. It is not just a glorified cameo. Both of these things add to the weight of the alien visitor side of the movie.

It is shot with a filter in much the same manner as the Dark Knight movies was to give it a harsher tone which works quite well, if removing a little too much emotion from the movie in places. It attempts to remain grounded where possible and tries to make this a more ""realistic"" Superman tale. This only works up until a point as the final third of the movie is something else entirely.

Lets just say for those of you who criticized Superman Returns as being ""boring"" really got your monies worth with this one. Superman Vs Zod in this film equals a leveled city basically. I've not seen two characters throw each other through as many buildings ever i don't think.

Cavill plays the role of Superman/Clark Kent well and while at first i thought he did not, i then remembered how this was his origin tale and where i thought he may have been lacking the typical geeky Clark charm, that is still to come. Shannon as Zod i still remain up in the air about. Menacing enough for sure but I am not sure he compares to Stamp in terms of pure Character.

Never the less this is the blockbuster of the summer and deserves to be seen for the pure spectacle even if you are not a Superman fan. Not perfect by a long shot but still an enjoyable action movie and an interesting take on DC's most beloved icon."
"Oct 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,"It has many flaws. But that's mainly because Zack Snyder directed it. But it's still a kick ass summer movie.

B"
"Oct 13, 2012",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel is awesome! Do not, I repeat do not listen to critics on this one. In fact don't listen to them at all."
"Oct 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,"I was not impressed by this movie. It had okay acting and the fighting scenes were pretty ""boring"". I felt it could have been better but still a decent action movie. I would recommend seeing it on the big screen and not on netflix. I believe the DVD version of this movie would actually make it worse because you will not be engulfed by it compared to the big screen."
"Oct 12, 2012",POSITIVE,"I rely on Rotten Tomato for much of my decisions in what movies I see at the theater, at home on DVD or not at all. Unfortunately I can't understand my rating on this movie can me so off what others saw. Man of Steel is one of very few movies I'd see a second time."
"Oct 12, 2012",NEGATIVE,"This movie is an excellent example of great ideas ruined by bad direction.  The elements are all there for a great movie, but Snyder fails to bring them together in a coherent way. This flaw leads to a lack of character development and that is why by the end of the movie when the world is being obliterated, you won't really care all that much."
"Oct 12, 2012",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this movie, it's probably one of my favourite superman movies. It explores more of Kal El beginnings and home planet, movie is packed with action with a few interesting twists. Also have to mention its also good eye candy! lol"
"Oct 12, 2012",POSITIVE,"One of Zack Snyder's Best Movies.
Can't wait for Sequel with BATMAN"
"Oct 11, 2012",NEUTRAL,could have been better micheal shannon stole the movie hated the choppy story telling at the begining but kind of a ridiculous end to the main fight
"Oct 11, 2012",POSITIVE,I usually don't like remakes but I liked this one. Waiting for part II.
"Oct 11, 2012",POSITIVE,"A truly spectacular experience from start to finish. The actors are great, the characters are very well portrayed and believable, and the action scenes are among the most amazing I've ever seen. You've never seen action so powerful and fast in live action executed so well. Another great nod? Using the actual actor for Superman on a green screen through a majority of, if not every single, flight sequence to harken back to the Richard Donner days. This film has a little something for everyone, whether you are a die-hard Superman fan or not."
"Oct 10, 2012",NEUTRAL,Pretty good but rewrites the origin story. Lots of destruction.
"Oct 10, 2012",POSITIVE,I really liked this movie. We got a look into the back story of how superman was born and the events leading up to his departure from Krypton. I really enjoyed seeing that rather than just the same old story that's been told a million times. This is quite possibly my favorite Superman movie yet.
"Oct 10, 2012",NEGATIVE,That was not a movie.It was something like various segments of movies together and an ending of total destruction without any serious story.A good soundtrack and a perfect choice of the new superman but the result is not good enough.Hope that the sequel gets better..
"Oct 9, 2012",POSITIVE,"A hard-hitting, grounded and refreshing take on a character that others seem to hold in iconography rather than character. It's the first chapter. Superman for the age of cynicism."
"Oct 9, 2012",POSITIVE,My only complaint is that it had alittle too much action and not enough of a story.
"Oct 9, 2012",POSITIVE,"Critics are idiots!! too many people want to see t same character built by Chris reeves and are afraid to start new and develop a more realistic Superman. Snyder builds t psyche of a true to life character who is just trying to find his place in the universe. There were some spotty gaps in storytelling but was overall mindblowingly amazing. Comparable to batman begins in that it may not be perfect, but led to the dark knight rises!"
"Oct 9, 2012",POSITIVE,I'm a Superman fanatic... I do not care how old I become ill always feel like Clark Kent...
"Oct 9, 2012",POSITIVE,"It was fantastic, and a great way to (hopefully) start the new DC cinematic Universe."
"Oct 9, 2012",NEGATIVE,"He wasn't the Boy Scout that Superman should be. Amy Adams is a great actress, but she didn't fit as Lois Lane."
"Oct 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Man of Steel was so over-saturating (in a bad way) that it left me clueless as to if I liked the movie or not. I wasn't the only one though.

They couldn't keep a consistent stream of genre through and when they tried to, it didn't work. There's a bunch of other things I'm nit-picky about but I don't want to butcher it too much because overall it was a good movie. Honestly, they did the best they could with such a boring character.

As always from any Zack Snyder film, you can expect amazing visuals accompanied by Hans Zimmer's brilliant score."
"Oct 8, 2012",NEGATIVE,Fight sequences were cool but other than that I wasn't really into it.
"Oct 8, 2012",POSITIVE,Best Superman to date!
"Oct 8, 2012",POSITIVE,Absolutely amazing movie. Both visually and acting. I am at a loss for words. Every superman movie should follow in Man of Steel's footsteps.
"Oct 8, 2012",POSITIVE,Nolan with crew did a sweet job on this superhero film.
"Oct 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,"lacked in character development and the lines weren't delivered as well, but entertaining and visually stunning. tells the story in a clear way."
"Oct 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Not bad at all. Of course not as good as Nolan's trilogy, but what is? The music is brilliant. The plot is a bit too straightforward. Bonus points for Russell Crowe, Diane Lane and Amy Adams."
"Oct 7, 2012",NEUTRAL,"3 stars for Russell Crowe. Boring story line, bad script and a more tedious Henry Cavill."
"Oct 7, 2012",POSITIVE,"The definitive Superman film of our generation. Snyder, Nolan, and Goyer have truly accomplished something great. Has some cool Easter eggs in it too. Great acting and epic action. Some minor plot holes but nothing that should bother the viewer during the duration of the film. A great film for a legendary icon! Grade: A+"
"Oct 7, 2012",NEGATIVE,"I was very disappointed in this. Some of it was okay and the acting was fine. the story was just mediocre. the whole thing was so jumpy though, I don't know why the cinematographer felt.the need to throw the camera around. anyway I expected a much better movie."
"Oct 7, 2012",POSITIVE,"I huge improvement over SUPERMAN RETURNS, this was another in a long string of reboots, but I think that Christopher Nolan being a part of the production elevated it beyond just another superhero movie. Zach Snyder has finally started making good films again. Pay no attention to the critics on this one. They clearly have seen too many movies."
"Oct 7, 2012",NEUTRAL,"It has it's issues, but it's still a worthwhile film."
"Oct 7, 2012",POSITIVE,Oh my god this was AMAAAZZZZINNGGG!!!
"Oct 7, 2012",POSITIVE,"plenty of moments where i sat in amazement, at times about detail, times about action sequence, times about character development. lot more scope for development that was under utilized. it represented a lot of what movie watching experience is to me. feeling wowed and feeling great after the movie."
"Oct 7, 2012",POSITIVE,It's a solid five for 'Fat' Cavill and co!
"Oct 7, 2012",POSITIVE,I really liked this movie. Like the batman films it seems to have been taken out of the comic books and given more of a human field.  We get to see the alien visitor through all of the traumas if growing up and we see the difficulties associated with living with his powers. I didn't like the retrospective telling of the back story and would have preferred to see everything chronologically.  Was great to see they avoided the s word where possible.  I liked it and will be buying the DVD !
"Oct 6, 2012",POSITIVE,"This was a great movie!!! Lots of action, great dialogue, and great story!"
"Oct 6, 2012",NEGATIVE,"Ok, but really another unnecessary remake of a story that has been dry for a while now. It's visually stunning in ways, but nothing innovative or original. The story kind of takes the journey out of watching a hero discovery himself and focuses on other plot points that people could understand without. Overall, it's nothing special or worth paying 10 dollars to go see, but it will entertain on a discount day or DVD enough to watch one time."
"Oct 6, 2012",POSITIVE,slow start but definitely worth the wait
"Oct 6, 2012",POSITIVE,Visually Man of Steel was awesome and the action was intense. Costner getting taking out in a tornado was a bit much. I'd much rather him go in the driveway like all the other times. Him dying in the tornado was a lesson learned which made the Man of Steel seem a bit hard headed. You don't have to die to teach your kid a lesson. Right? Right!!! In the end it was a great movie. Hopefully it's the start of a great franchise.
"Oct 6, 2012",POSITIVE,"This has a much lower score than Iron Man 3...are people that butt hurt about this movie not featuring the Superman they grew up with that they can't properly rate movies anymore?  It's a decent watch, has some scenes which you wish were cut in better.  I think because of the more serious tone and cinematography, people seem to feel they can more easily criticize this summer movie over movies like Iron Man 3 or Pacific Rim."
"Oct 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,"In my opinion, Man Of Steel is superior to any and all Marvel movies excluding Spider-man 2 and maybe Amazing Spider Man (yes, that includes Avengers). What made this film so good to me was how different it was than all of the other repetitive superhero movies pouring out of studios today. Most people will not agree with me, but I absolutely loved Man Of Steel, not just for the absurdly epic environment it takes place in, but because of the style and content. Yes, there were plot holes and gaps, but that's true of every superhero film. Bottom line, I loved this movie and think anyone not bashing anything not Marvel will as well."
"Oct 5, 2012",POSITIVE,Saw it in 3D and the action scenes were awesome. It had a really good story line and the final battle scene is incredible.
"Oct 5, 2012",POSITIVE,"Wow, enjoyed it more than I thought I would."
"Oct 5, 2012",NEUTRAL,shut up and take my money
"Oct 5, 2012",POSITIVE,A great reboot of an American legend.
"Oct 5, 2012",NEUTRAL,Half of a great movie.
"Oct 5, 2012",POSITIVE,Amazing and refreshing take on a classic
"Oct 5, 2012",NEUTRAL,"In its first half, Man of Steel stands tall particularly by its mythological and emotional side, but when the action begins (and it begins very well at first), the over-used cgi effects and destructive action scenes dont quite feel right and give the movie a false sense of over-stated grandiosity."
"Oct 5, 2012",NEUTRAL,"I was disappointed about this movie, I was waiting so much more from producer Christopher Nolan and director Zack Snyder. The story didn't bring anything really new. Great spectacle, weak story, that's not enough for me. Oh, I need to mention Michael Shannon, he was good."
"Oct 5, 2012",POSITIVE,Mi 2do view cambio mi opini√É¬≥n
"Oct 4, 2012",POSITIVE,I read superman comics this the mixture of Nolans cinematic realism like with batman and arrow show and superman universe. It has its defaults like introducing characters without getting a better depth and a more of a setup than a forced romance with Louis but I love this movie
"Oct 4, 2012",POSITIVE,It was amazing and epic. I don't know what some of the people are saying. This fresh takes boring old Superman to a new level. Christopher Nolan destroys this film! :D
"Oct 4, 2012",POSITIVE,"Overall I was pleased with the restart of the series. Zod was more like his comic counterpart (insane), and the acting was superb."
"Oct 4, 2012",POSITIVE,This rendition of Superman was great!  It revamped the storyline which was needed and the cast was great. Tons of action and Henry Cavill did awesome.
"Oct 4, 2012",NEUTRAL,I actually enjoyed this much more than I thought I would. Nice to see a more serious tone to a superman interpretation for once. CG was decent as was casting with the exception of Amy Adams who's Lois Lane lacked the spunk of the original.
"Oct 3, 2012",POSITIVE,"A bit long, but a definite step in the right direction for Superman.  The movie felt like a good bridge to more exotic and amazing things in the Nolanverse."
"Oct 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Packed with action, fight scenes were pretty astonishing. Dialogue left much to be desired, definitely some hokey parts. Overall, I really liked the movie, including how the story was sequenced."
"Oct 3, 2012",POSITIVE,Fuck you Rottentomatoes with your 56% this is the best superheroe movie ever...
"Oct 2, 2012",POSITIVE,This movie is so great!!!!!
"Oct 2, 2012",POSITIVE,"best super hero movie ever good story , good action , good drama , madee feel a man can fly all over again"
"Oct 2, 2012",POSITIVE,"Fantastic, Epic, Dare I say Super cool! Enough superlatives I really enjoyed this. film. Fist pumping in the air action."
"Oct 1, 2012",POSITIVE,Best Superman movie ever.
"Oct 1, 2012",NEUTRAL,Man of Steel: Amazing acting all around. Stunning visuals. Uneven story. The fights were epic. Kudos for letting Cavill keep his chest hair.
"Oct 1, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Good most of the way through, the last 60 mins should have been a 30 mins. Last fight scene way over the top and too ridiculous."
"Oct 1, 2012",NEUTRAL,glad I didn't pay attention to these crazy critics. best superman since superman 2. covered everything that needed to be covered and had awesome action sequences along with some slight humor
"Sep 12, 2012",POSITIVE,This movie was a great way to start this movie franchise. I loved the action and the coming of age story line was great. Lived the fight scenes the CG was awesome great job all around.
"Sep 12, 2012",POSITIVE,Awesome!!! Looking fwd to Justice League ;)
"Sep 11, 2012",POSITIVE,Best superman movie ever!!! Full of action and just when you think the action has stopped√¢¬¶ MORE action
"Sep 11, 2012",NEGATIVE,"superman dose not kill! 
man of steel dose!!!!!!"
"Sep 11, 2012",POSITIVE,"Great intro for a new generation. Superman has never been my favorite but this movie sucked me in with a great story, impressive action and visuals and a great choice of actors"
"Sep 11, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Man of Steel contains more action and visually exciting spectacle than any Superman film previous, however it lacks the heart that has made the character such an enduring American icon."
"Sep 11, 2012",POSITIVE,By far the best Superman movie. Great plot and thoroughly explained in every detail. Action sequences were particularly over the top and with so much happening it does get a bit overwhelming. Overall brilliant film in my opinion!
"Sep 11, 2012",POSITIVE,Finally a Superman movie that has everything that I love about the superhero
"Sep 11, 2012",NEGATIVE,"Yes this movie was better than that monstrosity called Superman Returns. Unfortunately that does not make this a good flick. The movie was rushed at times, while others just dragged along. I had such big hopes for this movie. I should ave never jumped on the hype train and stuck with my gut. On the bright side Cavill was a really really good Superman."
"Sep 10, 2012",NEUTRAL,This one went on a little too long and the ever-repeating return of the villain kept getting boring after a little while! Great casting!
"Sep 10, 2012",NEUTRAL,All though this film had great concept ideas and a lot of action the story line was lacking and there were things that a true Superman Fan can not get over. It was big and there is tons of explosions and destruction but not enough dialogue or a true story line! Kinda let down!
"Sep 10, 2012",POSITIVE,An amazing masterpiece  explosive from beginning to end 5/5.
"Sep 10, 2012",POSITIVE,Best superman film by far. About time somebody made a good one. Story perfectly told. Looking forward to another.

""What if a child dreamed of becoming something other than what society had 
intended? What if a child aspired to something greater?""

Oh boy, this was a film firmly near the top of my must watch list. I'm not a fan of Superman in general i tend to find he is a dull boring character and despite the positive views of the original from '78 with 'Christopher Reeves' i never took a shine to it, it just felt ok to me nothing more, nothing less. But when i heard that 'Zach Snyder' was working on the new 'Superman film, entitled 'Man of Steel' i was interested. 

I've always felt he was an under-appreciated director - i loved 'Watchmen' and i liked 'Sucker Punch' for what it was so i was looking forward to what he could bring to the table and hopefully get the recognition i feel he deserves. Unfortunately when i saw the rating on rotten tomatoes i was a little worried i usually ignore the critics completely but on this i had a feeling was going to be disappointed for some reason. So when i finally went to see it i prepared to be disappointed but i needn't of been. I loved it and can easily say it's the best superman film to date. It starts at the origin of Clark's ('Henry Cavill') birth on 'Krypton' and through flash backs tells of his childhood and what he has to deal with and when resumes to present day takes us through him becoming 'Superman' and confronting his first nemesis. Some have issues with the pacing and the disjointed way it uses the flash backs and despite me really liking this film it's hard to disagree. It seems like he has been reworked a lot with certain scenes moved about and swapped making some of the position choices baffling. However it doesn't bother me as much as it does with others - probably because my favourite scene was part of one of these - John Kent's ('Kevin Costner') death was both brilliantly captured and emotionally charged. The thing is despite all the flaws it has - the underused characters and the unnecessary ones, the disjointed way the flash back were put together and a few dodgy lines - i still loved it. There are quite a few problems but i just don't care. As usual 'Snyder' does a wonderful job of shooting the film it can't be denied the guy has an eye for style. The angles used in certain scenes really captured the moment - the second time 'Clark' takes off and his escape from the ship where he was held are wonders to behold. It may contain the odd off moment but it's full of so many captivating and wow moments that they can be overlooked.

I want to talk about the much disliked neck snap of 'General Zod' ('Michael Shannon') and i have this to say - ""what is the problem?"". This is in fitting with everything the film does. The whole 'Superman' doesn't kill people can't fly because he has killed people in the past 'Superman II' was example. But more importantly is that he's still finding himself here he knows that he has to match 'Zod's merciless nature to save the planet otherwise how else can he stop him? No prison on earth would hold him and taking him into space would be worse giving him a slow agonizing death. Another thing to remember is this is his first time as 'Superman' he doesn't know what to do he has hold of 'Zod' he can't let him go and he can't let him kill those people. He is basically making the choice of either saving his original race of which he know little or his adoptive one where he was raised and given his chance to live. So yeah it may have been slightly brutal for 'Superman' but it was certainly a necessary decision and the correct. And even though he made the right decision he screams out in regret and agony at one he's done - and it also give more wait to him refusing to kill again - dooming his entire race.

Tonally it is a film of muted colours a film of steeliness if you will. It fits in with his demeanor of figuring out who he is as well as the lack of humour another complaint which i have to disagree on the heart-ache he endures of both his father's deaths (one of which he could of prevented but chose not to because he trusted him) and all the question he has lens it to a more seriously toned film. Of cause this alienates children who won't get the film they expect but for adults it's a far more tangible and realistic approach.

'Henry Cavill' is fantastic as 'Superman' he's not 'Heath Ledger' to 'The Joker' or 'Downey Jr. to 'Iron man' good but he does make for a great 'Superman' he as the square jawed looks and the long staring gaze. Everyone else is good as well 'Fishburne' is good despite there being almost no point to his character being there and it would have been nice if 'Amy Adams' had more screen time as 'Lois Lane'. There was also more of 'Russel Crow' than i expected i knew he was playing 'Jor El' but i expected a more muted role tied just to the parts on 'Krypton.

'Man Of Steel' seems to have divided both critics and audiences alike and even though the side i'm on may be the one with the least supporters i don't care one bit. I loved this film the oddly ordered flashbacks and underused or pointless characters aside. There are some real memorable scenes here John Kent's death, Clark's first flight and Zod's death, i hope down the line it gets the recognition i feel it deserves, 'Snyder' yet again has divided opinion and as long as he's making films i like then i hope he continues that. This is without a doubt the best 'Superman' film iv'e seen and i may just watch it again."
"Sep 9, 2012",POSITIVE,"Absolutely brilliant in every way, don't know what's up with the critics.."
"Sep 9, 2012",POSITIVE,Absolutely amazing!!
"Sep 9, 2012",POSITIVE,Just watch it.  It's just that damn good!
"Sep 9, 2012",POSITIVE,"Great movie. Action-packed, great visuals, interestingly darker take on the origin story, and great performances from its cast, especially Shannon."
"Sep 9, 2012",NEUTRAL,7.5/10 - cant rate it 3.75 stars :(

""Unapologetically Comic-Booky . . . The film is desperately lacking in little scenes."" - Scott Mendelson


The fist 15 minutes of this film is amazing in and of itself, the rest of the film loses its weight with how much it tries to keep up the pace and push the envelope with its epic homages/references (which some viewers may not mind at all).


""The only way to know how strong, is to keep testing your limits."""
"Sep 8, 2012",POSITIVE,"Solid movie overall. 
Different take,
Different perspective, 
Different times, 
Different SUPERMAN!!

It was not perfect but it was a good origin movie. The the pacing was a bit quick and action was good. It had its teary eye  moments too.  
I thought Henry Cavill was an excellent Superman!!
I could go on and dissect the movie with pros and cons. But ultimately this is my opinion so go watch it and form your own. You will not be disappointed!!"
"Sep 8, 2012",POSITIVE,"You know what? Screw the critics. This is hands down one of the best action movies and best movies overall to come out this year. This restores the Superman franchise to its full glory. Henry Cavill is great as Kal-El/Superman, and there also some great performances by Kevin Costner as Pa Kent and Russell Crowe as Jor-El. The action scenes, while they can be a little redundant at times, are definitely high in scale, well shot, and definitely pack a punch, especially during the hour of the film. It's also great to finally get a Superman that we could relate to quite a bit; we see how he struggles to fit into a normal world, trying to find his destiny and reason in life. On other notes, the visual effects are pretty spectacular, Michael Shannon does a pretty good job as the villain (even though he could have been just a little more menacing), and Hans Zimmer's score for the film is breathtaking. This brought everything that I was hoping for in a Superman movie. I was a little skeptical of this after seeing Sucker Punch and seeing the failure that was, but Zack Snyder definitely came back with a bang. I don't care what the critics say; this movie is freaking phenomenal and I'm very uncertain now as to whether or not I like this more or less than Star Trek Into Darkness, which is my second favorite film of the year so far."
"Sep 8, 2012",POSITIVE,Maybe Superman is too square for people these days. But Squares run the world that is full coolb fools. I thought the movie was great.
"Sep 8, 2012",POSITIVE,"Critics are morons this movie was amazing like nothing I've ever seen! So much action/destruction its insane! Solid performances all around, fantastic CGI, spectacular action scenes, just a genuinely great movie! 9.4/10"
"Sep 8, 2012",POSITIVE,My number 1 must see of 2013! Huge Superman fan!!!! :)
"Sep 8, 2012",POSITIVE,A fresh new take for the Superman movie fans. Looking forward to seeing the next one.
"Sep 8, 2012",POSITIVE,"Great reboot of the Superman films, Cavill was brilliant and it's great to see a Superman film based very much around Krypton and it's people not just Superman on Earth."
"Sep 7, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Explosions, damage, not much else...
3 Abbie Cornishes"
"Sep 7, 2012",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel is a Very Good Movie!! First of all Henry Cavill is an excellent Clark Kent/Superman. Great Cast,Music,Special Effects,Action. It was so Epic!! For Sure This Movie is One of The Best Movie of 2013."
"Sep 7, 2012",POSITIVE,Fucking fantastic! Completely amazing! Don't listen to the critics! Go watch it yourself
"Sep 7, 2012",POSITIVE,"I don't know why critics give this film 53% but I think they are just being silly. This film is great! Best superman film ever! Just what we waited for years. :D The casting was great, the acting was fab, the action was just Excellent! It's not a comic superman, this is a realty superman. Like with the Batman films today. Go see this film people, it's worth every penny. :)"
"Sep 7, 2012",POSITIVE,"some plot holes, but overall good"
"Sep 7, 2012",POSITIVE,This movie was outstanding. The story and all the acting was great. I'm going to go see it again.
"Sep 7, 2012",POSITIVE,"AMAZING! Great movie, with an awesome storyline and GREAT GREAT GREAT ACTION! It is as great as The Dark Knight Trilogy but no movie will ever beat The Dark Knight"
"Sep 7, 2012",POSITIVE,If I could give this movie 5 more Stars I would. It was excellent!!!
"Sep 7, 2012",NEGATIVE,This movie was rushed. Wasn't terrible. But it was good. It was so so. Superman was very boring and did not suck you in to his character at all. He looked the part but didn't bring home the goods.
"Sep 7, 2012",POSITIVE,"I love the new remake of Superman! Zach Snyder really brought the Superman to life by examining his metaphysics and morality. Even though action scene are quite tense, the computer animation seem somewhat phony compare to the 1980's Superman portrayed by Christopher Reed."
"Sep 7, 2012",POSITIVE,Better than Superman Returns I'll tell you that.
"Sep 7, 2012",POSITIVE,"For me, this movie doesn't deserve a low RT score gave by the critics at all. It has Great action sequence. Superb emotional performance by the ""senior"" actors (Crowe,Costner and Lane), which could have been given more screen time. Adams and Fishburne nailed as daily planet duo, also could have been given more screen time. Traue steal the show as the villans of the movie, better than Shannon sadly. Cavill surely are the superman of our time, got the looks, posture and all. My biggest complaint of this movie is only the script. David Goyer made the cheasiest script for a movie that aim with full force, it's surely to blame. Snyder did his best, all the scne are wonderful and not like anything we ever seen before. But surely it deserve a better RT score than Superman Retuns, so I give it a 78% RT score for the actionpack  and beautiful scene alone. Heck-we could have gotten ""Superman Forever"" or ""Superman and Robin"" if they didn't try to change a bit or two with the superman origin story. Can't wait for the sequal, with Cavill more mature and much much better script."
"Sep 7, 2012",POSITIVE,This may just be the best superhero movie ever made! seriously!
"Sep 7, 2012",POSITIVE,"Say what you want about Man of Steel. From an entertainment standpoint it certainly does it's job and does it very well. The action is over the top and totally badass. That's just what I like. When I watch a movie the main thing I care about is entertainment and this movie most definitely has that aspect.

I also found this to be a solid origin story. Clark (Kal-El) finds himself as a human being, as well as Superman. Michael Shannon is one of my favorite working actors and I though he was great as General Zod. I just wish that he was in the film a little more.

In the long run I find Man of Steel to be one of the most entertaining films of 2013. It does have some issues and I recognize them, but I am able to overlook them for the most part."
"Sep 7, 2012",POSITIVE,"It's problems are there, mainly in the screenwriting and an overdone production. However, Man of Steel is serious, grounded and brought out the true meaning of being the worlds most iconic superhero. It made me interested in superman. As far as the sequel, bring it on."
"Sep 7, 2012",NEGATIVE,Sterile and emotionless... Way too long; poorly cast.  Almost every scene has a terrible line in it.
"Sep 7, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Not what I was expecting, and not in a good way. The films sets itself up perfectly. The first 30 mins are constructed thoughtfully and set the tone for the events to come. These events did not come. An admirable, but mistaken decision to leave all the action to end ultimately caused the vast majority of the middle to feel dragged out. Not only that, but it was awfully disjointed, unsure of its own pace. It either jumped too quickly from one scene to the next, or dragged out a scene too long where you expected more from each conclusion. Despite all these flaws, I find it difficult to call Man of Steel a 'bad film'. Calling it that would dishonor some outstanding performances by its leads, most notably Russell Crowe's. There's enough life in this film to justify a sequel or 2, which I await with excitement due to the way this film ends. 

In conclusion, was it a disappointment: yes. Was it a bad film: No.
My expectations were high for this film and it unfortunately falls short but there's still entertainment to be had.
Welcome back, Superman."
"Sep 7, 2012",NEUTRAL,Could have been better.  too much action not enough build up for the characters!  had the potential to be great but failed to deliver.
"Sep 7, 2012",POSITIVE,wowwww brutalmente EPICA!!!!  nada mas que decir!!!! Nolan Goyer y Snyder....nadie mas!!!
"Sep 7, 2012",NEGATIVE,Shaky cam style ruined it for me.
"Sep 7, 2012",POSITIVE,Loved every minute if it!
"Sep 7, 2012",NEGATIVE,"Overly dark, jumpy, and lacking in any kind of humanity or feeling of the hope that Superman should be about. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
"Sep 7, 2012",POSITIVE,Oooooh j'ai h√É√Ç¬¢te...
"Sep 6, 2012",POSITIVE,I don't know why this movie has such a low rating. It was a great movie and they final got superman right.
"Sep 6, 2012",POSITIVE,"This movie was amazing. I enjoyed the take on Superman instead of what we have seen over the years and a more realistic approach to the question of what if SM was real? Although there seem to be visual elements reminiscent of The Matrix, Star Wars: ROTS and Avatar the battle at the end was like nothing I have ever seen."
"Sep 6, 2012",POSITIVE,Absolutely epic. Loved it!
"Sep 6, 2012",POSITIVE,"""Man of Steel'' is a terrific re-imagining of the beloved Superman. It pays homage to the story and original Superman film.
 With a great cast including Russell Crowe as Jor-El, Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent, and Henry Cavil as Kal-El, Zach Snyder has given us a more realistic Superman, with dazzling effects and motivational themes.
  The films problems are few but a bit noticeable. Superman never fully develops into the Superman we know and love. The film neglects to show him saving many people. Yes he saved the whole world, but I want a Superman who saves people from falling buildings and from cars falling off bridges. 
 Despite this and minor narrative flaws, its a welcome and awesome reboot of Superman and DC's universe."
"Sep 6, 2012",POSITIVE,surprising moviein the coming summer.
"Sep 5, 2012",POSITIVE,amazing! way better than superman returns.
"Sep 5, 2012",POSITIVE,Much better than Iron Man 3 and better than critics would suggest. Story was altered from original but they did a good job at it. Romance between Superman and Lois Lane was abrupt but it plays out ok.
"Sep 5, 2012",NEGATIVE,Disappointing.  Lots of action. Interesting story line but lost superman's love for people.
"Sep 5, 2012",POSITIVE,supertastic brilliant effects and great story line def one to watch :-)
"Sep 5, 2012",POSITIVE,Don't listen to the haters! This movie is awesome. Best Superman movie I've seen!
"Sep 5, 2012",POSITIVE,"I cant believe the reviews of this movie, i thought it was AWESOME! they did a great job of showing flashbacks (not distracting or disjointed) and progressing the story.

I usually dont go see movies, but honestly, i want to see it again."
"Sep 4, 2012",POSITIVE,"Having seen 5 generations of Superman, this was definitely @ the top."
"Sep 4, 2012",POSITIVE,thz shit fir show more
"Sep 4, 2012",POSITIVE,As a comicbook geek it's my job to let everyone know that Superman is lame.
"Sep 4, 2012",NEGATIVE,One of the worst movies I've ever seen... utter crap!
"Sep 4, 2012",NEGATIVE,"Ovaj film je totalno podbacio, ne razumem ni zasto su mrcvarili"
"Sep 3, 2012",POSITIVE,Another good Zack Snyder comic adaptation.
"Sep 3, 2012",POSITIVE,"Thank God, they are deciding to reboot rather than try tacking on to the original. The last Superman movie was ok, but the only acting I enjoyed was that of Lex Luthor. This will be a fresh start with fresh actors. Don't get me wrong, the original three movies (we're going to believe movie #3 never existed) were works of art and totally awesome. I'm really excited by the actor/actress lineup too. In Superman Returns, I was disappointed in so many ways with the actor for Superman because it felt like he was trying too hard to fit the previous Superman, which will never happen."
"Sep 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,"A slow burn up to a great crescendo..... 
Suffers from origin storyitus in that it has a lot of information to cram into its 2.5 hour timeframe but the ending sets it up nicely for future movies and the small geek nods to missing characters only enhances the desire to see them realised later on in the franchise"
"Sep 3, 2012",POSITIVE,Easily the best superman thus far.
"Sep 3, 2012",NEGATIVE,"A mess of a translation from script to screen, Snyder seems to have missed the mark on how to cleanly deliver an emotional, deeply profound take on the world's most recognized superhero. Man of Steel delivers on spectacle almost overwhelmingly so, but its minor plot details crumble, leaving the major plot at hand barren and without a heart."
"Sep 3, 2012",POSITIVE,"This was a nice comeback for the Superman saga. Good action, good message and very entertaining."
"Sep 3, 2012",POSITIVE,Awesome!  ...Critics don't know what they are talking about.
"Sep 3, 2012",NEGATIVE,"Zack Snyder has a flare for action and brooding characters, but all his movies thus far lack any sense of joy. Coupled with poor writing from David S Goyer, forcing character development to suffer, we don't really see a ""super"" man in this film. With nothing super or inspiring about it, ""Man of Steel"" is slightly disappointing... but only slightly. It has a lot to carry on its shoulders, being the first step in DC's shared cinematic universe, but they can hopefully only do better now that the origins of the new Clark Kent has been established. Whether or not Snyder or Goyer should be tasked with bringing the next chapter to life will remain debatable until said chapter hits theatres a few years from now."
"Sep 2, 2012",POSITIVE,"With endless action sequences of someone or something crashing through a building of some sort, Man of Steel is the best Superman film to date."
"Sep 2, 2012",NEUTRAL,Didn't like jumpy flashbacks
"Sep 1, 2012",POSITIVE,Kevin and Russell make great dads. Love the back story. Superman looks great with his beard. Although the action sequences were a bit too long
"Sep 1, 2012",POSITIVE,damn good movie. I can't wait to see it again!
"Sep 1, 2012",POSITIVE,"""You will give the people an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun. In time, you will help them accomplish wonders.""
A quote from Man of Steel's character Jor-El portrayed by Russel Crowe. This is a different approach to telling the tale of Superman. I'm so glad that Zack Snyder was able to get the spot in directing this film. Man of Steel really proves Snyder's ability to show action and powerful storytelling. MOS was an dazzling spectacle. I could not believe my eyes. This is some of the best CGI I have seen in my life. Kevin Costner plays Jonathan Kent (Superman's ""Dad"") with such heart. The relationship between Cavill and Costner is terrific. Michael Shannon is an astonishing Villian. He is a multi layered character and that makes the movie that much better! I am now a huge fan of Superman. I would recommend this film to anyone who can enjoy some action. Hans Zimmer's music just adds to the experience. He gives it a much more epic feel. I would definitely see this again and again."
"Sep 1, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The thing I enjoyed most about this movie was the action and cinematography. Henry was also a very believable Superman, but Russell Crowe was the best cast person. The movie though a little violent is family friendly and fun."
"Sep 1, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Not to shabby, but still just another summer blockbuster. On the other hand at least in a way its better than Superman Returns"
"Sep 1, 2012",POSITIVE,"Critics were wrong, I'd say this Is one of the best versions and re-imaginings of Superman"
"Sep 1, 2012",POSITIVE,Very excited for this hasn't been a good superman movie since superman 2
"Sep 1, 2012",NEUTRAL,visually impressive. ....story not so much
"Aug 31, 2012",NEUTRAL,"It was good, though there was too much unnecessary destruction. I get they are super and all but still..."
"Aug 31, 2012",POSITIVE,Great acting. Superb script. Awesome action. All-around SUPER!
"Aug 31, 2012",NEUTRAL,A solid starter to a new Superman Franchise.
"Aug 31, 2012",POSITIVE,Chris Nolan as producer and writer...that means there is light at the end of this DC tunnel
"Aug 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,"As far as movies go, Man of Steel was decent. However, something felt like it was missing. For a movie that is meant to reboot the Superman franchise, it felt somewhat hollow. I don't mean it was boring, far from it. In fact the action scenes were top notch. What I mean is it felt less like a Superman movie and, as my friend put it, more like a standard two and a half hour summer sci-fi blockbuster. The only times I felt like this is a Superman movie was at the beginning on Krypton and with some of the early flashbacks to Clark's youth, and at the end during the final fight with Zod, played by Michael Shannon who quite possibly surpasses Terrance Stamp in the role. One can easily see where they were trying to replicate the deep brooding psychology that made Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy so successful, and for the most part it works relatively well. Almost. It never really achieves the same level of mastery that Nolan's films did. On top of all that, there are plenty of glaring inconsistencies within the movie universe itself and the the constant flashbacks start to wear thin fairly quickly. However, many of these problems are arguably overshadowed by the smart cast and decent script. All in all, Man of Steel good but a bit underwhelming. Simply stated, while it does not achieve the mastery of Nolan's Batman films, or even the first two original Superman movies (not counting the 1951 George Reeve film), Man of Steel is still and enjoyable ride with a few bumps here and there."
"Aug 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,"It was a good movie. But not ""great"" as I was expecting it to be. DC still lacks the humor that marvel movies carry so well. With that said I think it's promising so we'll just have to wait and see what happens when part 2 comes out."
"Aug 30, 2012",POSITIVE,"I'm glad they brought Superman back to life after that mess of a movie, ""Superman Returns""! Great performances! The visuals were stunning and the action scenes were intense.This is the movie Superman fans have been waiting for. In my opinion, it's the 'Batman Begins' of the series. Bravo!"
"Aug 30, 2012",POSITIVE,"Perhaps not the masterpiece ""The Dark Knight"" or ""Rises"" was. Perhaps some of the action sequences towards the end drag on for a bit too long. Perhaps some of Clark Kent's time before becoming Superman could have been given more consistent and lengthy screen time. However, how can one can argue with the sure-hearted heroism and idealism of the man of steel as he soars as no one can, fighting gods from space that claim evolution has made them the superior race? The science fiction elements from Krypton approach brilliance, coupled with the Zimmer score that intones religious gravity and majesty. Clark Kent is a real person to the viewer, one with genuine emotions, hopes and dreams that we all can identify with. ""Man of Steel"" walks a fine line between heavy darkness and lighthearted adventure. The result is a tale of idealistic heroism far superior to the amoral dribble that makes up most action films today."
"Aug 30, 2012",POSITIVE,I hope they do superman story justice as it one of my favourite characters.
"Aug 29, 2012",NEGATIVE,"I will describe the quality of this film with one of the lines from it: ""Dick Splash"".
From the moment the film started I let out a very confused ""Huh?"" Because the plot, dialogue and pacing was just dumb and frankly terrible. Lack of explanation for many plot elements and characters. The main problem was that they tried too hard to make Superman serious. It actually made me miss the cheesy films. It was almost laughable in parts. The actual decent parts were the visuals and fight scenes (especially the final fight between Superman and Zod which was actually pretty awesome). Overall though it was a disappointment, hopefully it's sequel makes up for it."
"Aug 29, 2012",POSITIVE,true way superman should told.badass all the way through.
"Aug 29, 2012",POSITIVE,A captivating epic on par with Marvel's The Avengers and the Dark Knight Trilogy.
"Aug 29, 2012",POSITIVE,"If you can approach this movie with a clear mind, you won't fail to be impressed by the sense of true comic-book fun and visuals Man Of Steel has to offer. And despite the numerous Hollywood incarnations of this well-worn superhero, this film still manages to feel fresh - no mean feat! Definitely worth watching if you're a Superman fan."
"Aug 29, 2012",POSITIVE,Super amazing Superman !
"Aug 28, 2012",NEGATIVE,Full review not provided because I couldn't allow myself to watch more than 10 minutes.  Absolutely terrible.  Half star.
"Aug 28, 2012",POSITIVE,Pure Awesomeness...loved it
"Jun 24, 2012",POSITIVE,amazing cant wait for the sequel
"Jun 24, 2012",NEUTRAL,"I liked it. It had some great action and it was quite pretty. As expected from Goyer, the dialogue was stilted and the pacing was a bit odd. The collateral damage was noticeable, but based on the focus and structure, it's just an element that I had to accept. Hopefully, they will use that to drive the story of the inevitable sequel."
"Jun 24, 2012",POSITIVE,"Cold, emotionless and Perfect!"
"Jun 24, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Good movie. Dark and sad, but good."
"Jun 24, 2012",POSITIVE,Loved it.  By far my favorite movie!  Loved it!
"Jun 24, 2012",POSITIVE,Superman was Awesome! And he grew up in Kansas :D
"Jun 23, 2012",NEUTRAL,I have yet seen a great Superman movie. They are all just ok.
"Jun 23, 2012",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel was amazing, Cumberbatch and crew have some serious competition."
"Jun 23, 2012",POSITIVE,the best movie ever casi me hace llorar
"Jun 22, 2012",POSITIVE,"Just seen the movie and read some reviews... A few points about this movie I want to share...

1. Though this is an ""origin movie"" I really wasn't mad that it's not a full back story movie.  Considering the movies of Christopher Reeves and 10 years of Smallville if you still haven't had enough origin then you will never have enough....

2. This movie gave Superman exactly what he's been needing in a Superman film....an opponent... Dont get me wrong I enjoy Lex Luthor as a villain but in all honesty what is the point of him having so many powers without an opponent to use them on. 

3. With Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder at the helm of this movie if you were expecting campy you don't know them well. When has either ever done campy?

4. Yes this story is rushed. Extremely rushed. I will definitely give the critics that. 

This movie is for those who want to see both the SUPER AND the MAN in Superman.....and not just another simple back story movie."
"Jun 22, 2012",POSITIVE,"GREAT movie and loved the restructuring of the telling of the Superman story. 

A bit too much hand-held camera work for my taste though."
"Jun 22, 2012",NEGATIVE,"It's just boring. 

There's no character you care for, half the film is CGI and... that's it. That's all there is to it. If you want to watch 3 hours of computer-drawn people smashing each other into things, this is your film. If you want a superhero film where you actually give a damn whether the hero wins or loses, watch Batman again."
"Jun 22, 2012",POSITIVE,Best super hero movie ever
"Jun 22, 2012",NEUTRAL,"This movie is all right. There were a few things I liked, like the special effects and casting (Russell Crowe stole the show as Jor-El and Henry Cavill did his best to live up to the Christopher Reeves Superman), but the movie was boring throughout many parts, there were times when there was a terrible shaky camera, and it felt like there was too much ""Clark Kent"" and not enough ""Superman"". Despite this movie's flaws I still have confidence in the movie franchise as a whole and feel like its sequels will more than likely be superior."
"Jun 22, 2012",POSITIVE,"An excellent movie, it really delivers as a SUPERman movie. Nolan and Snyder strike again"
"Jun 21, 2012",POSITIVE,"An Exhilarating Adventure, If A Bit Bombastic!"
"Jun 21, 2012",POSITIVE,"Best Superman movie EVER made, and easily the best movie of summer 2013.  Man of Steel is a masterpiece, much like Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises.  It looks at Superman's origin in an honest and realistic way.  How would the world react to an alien of such power who has been hiding among us?
The move was cast, written, directed, and edited brilliantly!  The main attractions being Henry Cavil, Michael Shannon, and of course the copious amounts of action.  The two main actors did an excellent job.  I'd put Shannon's Zod up there with Liam Neeson's Rah's Al Ghul and Ian McKellen's Magneto as a great, believable, villain.  Henry Cavill's portrayal of Superman/Clark was spot on in this pivotal turning point in his life as he chooses his destiny.  
Both sets of parents were brilliantly casted and while I would have loved to have seen more of Costner's Jonathan Kent, I really enjoyed getting to know more about Crowe's Jor-El.  
Amy Adams was excellent as Lois Lane.  She was the go-getter and the strong, stubborn Lois that I have always imagined.  
I loved every moment of this film.  I have to say that the end of the climactic confrontation was not what I was expecting.  It was powerful, gut wrenching, and extremely emotional, especially for a long time Superman fan.  This is Superman's first steps and he's learning and making mistakes as he grows into his red boots.  You could see on his face that, while he isn't quite ready for the responsibility of the most powerful being on the planet, he knows it's a burden he has to bear.  By Man of Steel 2 we'll have a more refined and cautious Superman on our hands.  
Overall a brilliant movie and a great addition to the Superman mythos.  Go see it now!!!"
"Jun 21, 2012",NEUTRAL,"A little disappointed that it was not the film i hoped it was going to be, but for a new generation of superman watchers i guess its a good film for them."
"Jun 21, 2012",NEGATIVE,I would like to see this movie but on dvd not a big fan of superman
"Jun 20, 2012",POSITIVE,Great beginning for a movie :) (probably 2-3 parts if they are planning for a justice league movie)
"Jun 20, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Good movie that has fight scenes that will make a Dragon Ball Z enthusiast proud, and an insurance claims adjuster cringe."
"Jun 20, 2012",POSITIVE,heat vision is awesome!
"Jun 20, 2012",POSITIVE,Exceptional origins movie that packs a lot of history and action in a short span. I dont know how the critics say it skims on love because there was definitly a connection between Lois and Clark.
"Jun 20, 2012",POSITIVE,the superman movie we've always wanted. the acting is very well done. henry nails it as superman. it moves a tad fast in some places but there's never a dull moment. its full of action and excitement
"Jun 19, 2012",POSITIVE,"An exceptional nice start to the DC Universe, Man of Steel starts anew in Krypton with a new born Kal-El being jettisoned towards Earth where he could grow and live peacefully as he deems fit. The scenes in Krypton were rich and full of details as I saw Jor-El coped with its imminent destruction and General Zod's coupe. Both men had a strong voice on the matter and both shared different methods on how to save their race. Towards the end of the Krypton sequence we start to go into Clark's life and through various flashbacks see how he and his parents coped with his powers as a young kid to a young adult. He struggles A LOT, but with a very exceptional performance by Kevin Costner, we see how Pa Kent and Ma Kent teach young Clark to hide and control his powers well and encourage him that one day, inevitably, he'll have to show them to the world and hope all goes well. This movie does pick up towards the middle of the movie and I have to say that Antje Traue captivated me with Faora.  A very well done performance as a sadistic soldier in my book. Now, the movie does have some faults, there weren't a lot, but there certainly were some. In some cases the camera zoomed in and out too much and the camera did shake a lot when our Man of Steel first takes flight. I could handle some of it in later scenes, but some of it was too much to handle all at once. Second, I felt like I didn't get enough of Clark/Kal-El in some scenes, he certainly played a very relatable Clark/Kal-El, but I just felt, in my honest opinion, that he didn't get enough lines or scenes in some cases. Overall, the movie is very good, the action set pieces are very well connected and didn't feel like all up in my face kind of action as I've felt with other movies, the acting performances were very well done, and I gotta say with a few issues here and there, I very much liked this movie and hope it does well to put a start to the DC Universe. Oh, and one more thing. This movie has a very controversial ending, I felt very iffy about it, but ultimately, you can't really change it at this point so it's going to be a 50/50 thing with most people. Either it's going to work, or it isn't."
"Jun 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,Lot of Special effects and good storyline!
"Jun 19, 2012",POSITIVE,"So f'n amazing, I can even put it all into words!!!"
"Jun 19, 2012",NEGATIVE,More pomp than circumstance in this latest reboot of a comic icon. A couple of in jokes that don't really amount to much. Heavy on sfx but storyline is much too lame. Good thing I didn't have to pay to see this one. Coin toss to put it in library.
"Jun 19, 2012",POSITIVE,It's a must see film! You will not be disappointed. Great story. Emotion. Lots of action.
"Jun 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Personally, its a movie which goes way beyond its limits. I feel that the movie should have taken on a smaller plot which would help define superman's orgins and then leave saving the world for its sequels(already in production). I could be very wrong since I don't read the superman comics though. 
                               As a movie it hits all the check marks, good acting,cinematography,story but due to the high octane action it doesn't leave much space for an emotional connection which was dramatically high in Batman Begins. Forgetting Batman and taking the previous superman movies its a great step up and one cannot deny that the action sequences are sometimes breathtaking. However after all the hype it seems a bit of a letdown. Nevertheless DC comics is still king!"
"Jun 18, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Let's take a step back shall we. What options did Zach Snyder and Christopher Nolan have with rebooting Superman? How about cartoony and fun Superman? That was done and redone in the 70s and 80s. Also, Marvel is already churning out a slew of light, but very fun and emotional superhero movies. So scratch that. How about a cartoony, but serious and dramatic Superman? Bryan Singer tried that back in 2006. Now, Superman Returns wasn't unwatchable, but it also wasn't anything that would inspire desire for a sequel. So scratch that. Nolan and Snyder's only other option? A gritty and realistic take on the character. That's the movie they wanted to make anyway, and it was their only option. 

So how did the filmmakers do, pass or fail? They get the passing grade, but just barely. I'll give them a C+, maybe a B-. They pass, not convincingly ... but they do not fail. For the first hour of this movie, it felt like Batman Begins: The Superman Edition. We are introduced to the origins of our hero in an intelligent fashion. There are interesting dramatic situations, and there is a huge moral question raised. Would the world be ready for Superman? It's this question that, number 1 originated the movie, and number 2, it drives the beginning hour of the movie forward. Before Zod comes to earth, the whole thing is so promising. But then the action kicks in...

The planet Krypton is dying. But before it does, the noble Jor-El launches a ship from Krypton to Earth. On this ship is Kal-El, Jor's son. Kal will go to earth as the last remaining Kryptonian. You know the story, he is adopted by the Kent family, and becomes Clark Kent. From there, he has to wrestle with his identity. Should he help people with his power? Is the world ready to accept someone like him? He'll have to answer these questions quickly, because an old threat from Krypton shows up on Earth. General Zod travels to Earth to collect Clark, and in turn, colonize our planet as the next Krypton. 

Alright, I've been over the story. The first half is great. The questions Clark asks himself are like a magnified version of issues we all face. Should we do all we can to help others? Can one person make a difference in the lives of those around him? Sure the questions are a lot more significant when you're Superman, but they still can apply to everyone. The moral of the movie reminded me of Batman Begins: ""What chance do we have if the good people do nothing?"" Bravo for the first act and a half. 

But when General Zod arrives on Earth, everything goes downhill. For the most part, once the action starts, the drama and morality of the story disappears. I'm not against action. I love it, and I fully expect it from my Superman movie. I'm not against a little bit of demolition. If indestructible aliens came to Earth, then stuff would blow up and buildings would fall. I'm not arguing that.

But the problem isn't in the action itself. In the moment, the action was pretty awesome once it finally did arrive. Yes, it's all very cool. But it's not colorful enough. No one has any fun (not that that's necessary, per se). The settings where the battles are staged are too drab and boring for it to leave a lasting impression. Also, the entire thing feels a lot more like a Sci-Fi movie than a Superhero movie. But it's still very good action, even if it does feel like ""Sci-Fi Man from Outer Space"" and not ""Superman.""

Whereas, the destruction in this movie is WAY over the top. This is the main complaint people have about this movie. Everything: skyscrapers, cars, and houses are trampled with reckless abandon. And like I said earlier, if aliens did come to Earth, some demolition would follow. But this movie just wallows in it. It doesn't bat an eye at the damage and life-loss it causes. It becomes ridicules after a good 20 minutes, then it goes on for another 40. It's just: cars get crushed, buildings crumble, and tanker trucks explode. Over and over and over again. While this is a big issue, it is an easily correctible one: just show some restraint with you action. Is that too much to ask?

The movie is bolstered by a slew of superb performances, even if the characters are a bit bland. Henry Cavill plays a handsome Clark Kent. He isn't given the chance to let the fun side of his personality out, but I expect more of that in the sequel. Clark has to do major soul-searching this entire movie ... not exactly something to take lightly and crack jokes about. Cavill does an excellent job bringing *this* version of Superman to the screen. It seems the character is reserved, but I have full confidence that Cavill could handle anything the role requires. Hopefully, they'll expand on Clark personal side a bit more in future movies. As it is, Cavill does a fine job with the character in these very serious situations. The best moments are when Clark's joy shows through, like the first time he flies, and when he tells Martha that he found out the truth about his past.

I've never seen Amy Adams give a bad performance. And she is as terrific as you would expect as Lois Lane. The character is written a bit weakly, without enough personality. But I really love Adams in the part. She is perfect! Give her more distinctiveness in the sequels!

Superhero movies have a very hard time nailing the villain role. When the ""bad guy"" works, the movie is vaulted into greatness. The Joker in The Dark Knight and Loki in The Avengers are both classic examples of tremendous villains. On the other hand, the whole Mandarin fiasco in Iron Man 3, Bane in The Dark Knight Rises, and Red Skull in Captain America (to a lesser extent) are all examples of a poor villain holding a movie back. So where does Michael Shannon as General Zod fall? Somewhere squarely in the middle. Shannon's performance is top-notch. He has everything you want from a villain, like menace, motivation, and physical power. But for one reason or another, he just isn't that memorable. 

The supporting cast is overflowing with talent. The fathers in Clark's life provide most of the quality drama. Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner are impeccable in their roles. And Diane Lane is very down to earth as Martha Kent. 

Hans Zimmer, composer of countless blockbusters, takes on the scoring duties for Man of Steel. Following in the footsteps of John Williams is next to impossible. So Hans doesn't even try, nor should he have. The film music snobs hate Zimmer's score. It's simple, electronic, and not overly heroic. Not a lick like Williams Superman. But it fits the movie like a glove, as is the case with almost every Zimmer score. And surprisingly, Zimmer does something with Superman that Williams never did: he gives Clark heart. Williams score was huge and epic, but it never did capture the humanity of the character. Zimmer's straightforward piano theme for Clark Kent has a simple beauty that Williams never chose to touch. Zimmer also writes a great theme for Superman himself, but it isn't heard much until the end credits. It's not Hans's best score, but it works wonders for the movie!

So how does this all sort out? Favorable, I'll tell you that. I liked the movie as an incredibly flawed piece of ground work. I sincerely hope that Zach Snyder and David Goyer learn some lessons from their first try. Throw some more humor and fun into the movie, give the characters more of a chance to show their personality, and for the love of all that's sacred, cut back on the mindless action! I'm not exactly ""excited"" to see Batman and Wonder Woman in this universe. But I am wildly fascinated how and if they'll be able to pull it off. But enough about the future, at the present I view Man of Steel as 65% interesting character study with a fine moral question, and 35% senseless destruction. Thankfully, the last five minutes of the movie left me with a big smile on my face! In Batman vs. Superman, I get the sense that we'll forget the Sci-Fi vibe of this movie, and find out what it really feels like to be a superhero!

""What are you going to do when you're not saving the world?"" 6.5/10"
"Jun 18, 2012",POSITIVE,"I've never been a huge fan of ""Superman"", and I never fully understood his whole story... That all changed with this movie!"
"Jun 17, 2012",POSITIVE,"It's lengthy and drags on at times but it is a lovely reboot and a worthy one at that.  ""Man of Steel"" lays out the blueprint to a darker story line for the boy in blue and it's about time!  I was skeptical of Henry Cavill taking the role as Kal-El -(Superman)- but I think he will bring justice to the more ominous undertone of future plots.  If you read the comics and know how Superman's life isn't always sunshine and happiness, you'll appreciate what's trying to be done here.  If your going in and expecting a glamorous hero to outshine and surpass the grasp of  pain's glutinous depths, you will not find it."
"Jun 17, 2012",POSITIVE,Different take on the overtold story of Superman. I liked it because of that but I knkw many wanted the same old story.
"Jun 17, 2012",NEGATIVE,"This movie was kind of a mess.  Maybe I was more critical of it because I'm a comic book fan but there were gigantic holes in the plot and several points where we just jumped from one scene to the next and I felt like we missed an important point in the story line and we were just supposed to fill in the gaps ourself.  That being said I was still entertained by the movie and will watch it again.  I mean come on, it's Superman!"
"Jun 17, 2012",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel was one great piece of Superhero cinema! It works on all levels. It's action packed, emotional and thrilling. The casting was great, the character tones were spot on and this movie exceeded all my expectations and then some. This is the superhero movie of the summer hands down!"
"Jun 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,"I liked ir more than I thought I would but it didn't blow me away.  First, the bad: Superman purists will wince.  This reboot changes Krypton and its history almost completely.  While this was necessary for this movie's plot as well as being a fresh and interesting retelling, it's probably not the direction I would have gone.  The good: Henry Cavill (Clark/Kal El) and Amy Adams (Lois) shine as the film's anchors, and the entire cast and their performances are fantastic (except for Lara, but that's negligible).  The special effects and combat scenes are sharp.  The storytelling is creative and robust.  Overall, an entertaining and quick moving 2.5 hours but lacking that little bit of oomph that's expected from a superhero summer blockbuster movie."
"Jun 16, 2012",POSITIVE,"Loved it but was very, very surprised with the conclusion."
"Jun 16, 2012",POSITIVE,Unbelievable amazing!!!!
"Jun 16, 2012",POSITIVE,Very good intro to the Man of Steel franchise. It could have been a tad bit better but it was a very solid film.
"Jun 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Yeah, I'm not gonna deny the fact that it was a disappointment."
"Jun 16, 2012",POSITIVE,"Great film, well done, I am considering it one of the best this year, if not the best Superman movie I have seen. I admit I was a touch skeptical going in. However I feel that the direction Hollywood has gone in the last 10 years has helped refine the viewpoint this story takes. We want to see something dark, a set of different twists, back stories that we don't know inside and out, we want to be surprised and given someone fresh.

This was not the story of Clark Kent becoming Superman, it was the story of Superman becoming Clark Kent."
"Jun 15, 2012",POSITIVE,great new take on superman...
"Jun 15, 2012",POSITIVE,Loved it when is number two??????
"Jun 14, 2012",POSITIVE,Way Better than the Henry Cavill version.  Can't wait until the sequel.
"Jun 14, 2012",NEGATIVE,Not right impressed :(
"Jun 14, 2012",POSITIVE,En helt annan story. I like!
"Jun 13, 2012",POSITIVE,FANTASTIC! F*CK THE CRITICS!
"Jun 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,A 'not bad' film extremely let down but its unnecessary ridiculous last hour.  Sometimes less is more when it comes to CGI.
"Jun 11, 2012",POSITIVE,"Henry Cavill makes an amazing Superman! This movie hits on comedy, sci-fi, action, and drama...all in one tightly wrapped package!"
"Jun 11, 2012",NEUTRAL,"While Henry Cavill delivers a very good Kal-El and the visuals are stunning as ever; the movie unfortunately suffers from a too wrung-out, too sloppy and too confusing storyline."
"Jun 10, 2012",POSITIVE,Loved it even with its problems.
"Jun 10, 2012",POSITIVE,"Best Superman film ever. Finally, Hollywood has done something right. Perfect cast, great script. Can't wait for more!"
"Jun 10, 2012",NEGATIVE,"While comic book fans will find something to enjoy, normal movie goers will find the film to be a bore and too much of a try hard. A few bad actor choices also don't help this movie live up to the potential."
"Jun 10, 2012",NEUTRAL,"It was good.

Very predictable, your typical origin story but still very predictable."
"Jun 9, 2012",POSITIVE,"This is, by far, the best of the Superman movies!  The story was excellent, perfect casting, superb action, and the CGI is incredible.  There is no comparison.  Critics who rate this less than four stars just don't get it."
"Jun 9, 2012",POSITIVE,The Critics are wrong.. this movie is more like a 70-80% .. it has flaws.. but god damn was it fun.. 2.5 hours blew bye for me.
"Jun 9, 2012",NEGATIVE,Not awful just disappointing. Oh and too loud! Or am I just getting old! ;)
"Jun 9, 2012",POSITIVE,"Do not listen to these dumb critics! If you like Superman, then you will LOVE this amazing movie!!!"
"Jun 9, 2012",POSITIVE,"Definitely among the best DC movies without  Heath Ledger in them. Nolan's influence is felt, but the dark overtones are ideal for a tale of a dark past and a man stepping out of fear into the light. No, it's not the pulse pounding Avengers or Iron-man I, but the plot and villains here are top notch, Cavill's Kal-El is spot on, and this is my favorite Lois ever. The other supporting performances are excellent, too.

So, tremendous action, good writing, strong performances. Only the directing was less than very good, and it was passable. Not sure what the critics wanted, but I'm quite satisfied.

All that said, the innate goodness essential to  the character is cheapened here. It would have taken very little for this to be a best-in-class. Write Jonathan Kent as the righteous dude Clark based his life on, shorten the fights, and make Superman's choice to kill Zod clearly one of necessity and it would have been near perfect."
"Jun 9, 2012",POSITIVE,"A bit cold & po-faced, with A few too many intense action bits, but overall, epic, exciting film-making. The next one will be even better and no doubt feature lots of comic Clark moments for all the comedy fans out there, who felt this lacking."
"Jun 9, 2012",POSITIVE,Probably one of the most unfairly criticized films of all time
"Jun 8, 2012",POSITIVE,One word... Awesome!!!
"Jun 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,Very entertaining!  Learned a lot more about Superman's homeland this time around.
"Jun 8, 2012",POSITIVE,"The sad part about it is, all of the critic reviews that were negative were all geared towards convincing others that the movie was looong... so long that it drew out the story, damaging the overall integrity of the story. The other half of the negative reviews were on how incredibly bombastic the film was.. BOMBASTIC.. meaning pretentious or filled with hot air if you will.. how and why?? This is god damn superman the man who can single handedly blow ip an entire universe with his sneeze im nearly 100% he can back his shit up.. thus eliminating any failed high sounding promises.

I for one thought it was the ultimate representation of a man of steel rising to become the man of tomorrow and the hero the world desperately needed.. struggling at times with his own past and present emotions and then of course the origin of his almost omniscient powers. Great film, Snyder."
"Jun 8, 2012",POSITIVE,"Excellent re-telling I the Superman saga.  I'm not a fan of re boots, but this one was done well. The future looks bright for the man of steel!"
"Jun 8, 2012",POSITIVE,This is going to be better than all the other films put together!!
"Jun 7, 2012",POSITIVE,"As a fan of superheroes, Superman has always been at the bottom of my list. No one, in my opinion, has ever been able to make this alter ego a believable one------ until now.

Imagine taking a story about a living god. An alien with Godlike powers. He's flawless. A boy scout in blue and red. He dedicates his life to serving humans. He is a good man with no darkness. Not like Batman, Wolverine, Spiderman, Daredevil, etc. He's the invulnerable hero. The most powerful. So, of course... He's boring.

It took the influence of one man to change the whole idea of Superman for me: Christopher Nolan. My Dark Knight Trilogy extraordinaire. Nolan designed his own Superman story in a way that is mind-bending and incredibly just. He takes a well-known, told again and again story and expands it to new heights with modernization. The story begins in Krypton where the planet is dying because its core is destabilizing. Scientist, Jor-El, played by the gifted Russell Crowe, and his wife Lara have conceived Krypton's first natural birth in centuries, his name, Kal-El. While Krypton self destructs, Jor-El is killed in a coup by General Zod, but he's still able to give the essence of his planet to his son before Lara sends him to earth. Instead of the story continuing through Kal-El's discovery on earth, we see him in the future as a grown man working hard from job to job as Clark Kent. Through flashbacks we see Clark's powers blossom, yet learn to hide his powers by his adopted parents Jonathan & Martha Kent until the world is ready for him. As Clark roams the world trying to find the meaning of his life and helping people, he finally discovers an old Krypton ship that had landed on earth 18,000 years ago. He finds solace when he is able to talk to his father's consciousness and get answers to his existence, and the concept of a Superman is created. With all due respect to Lex Luthor, but a Superman movie needs super-powered adversaries. So the second half of the movie gives us all the shock and awe we could ask for in an extended (maybe too extended) confrontation with Zod, who wants to make a Krypton out of Earth, killing all humans. Let it be reminded that Superman never kills, but when equally strong wills collide, something's got to give. Be prepared to be shocked some more as you feel Superman's heart-wrenching scream in its finale.

Now, I can give full credit to Nolan, but I shouldn't. As the director, Zack Snyder, brings amazing attention to detail in the films cinematography and visual effects. While still giving the audience a clear and coherent narrative and casting competent actors in these key roles. Speaking of, Henry Cavill makes for an excellent Superman. Shy and confused at first, then confident later on, balancing between darkness and decency. It also helps that he's hot. ;-)

Amy Adams as Lois Lane is great in the recent trend of intelligent female characters in superhero movies, not a whining damsel in distress the slightest bit.

Michael Shannon as General Zod is no Bane with his physic but is as over the top as a comic villain can be. He's a righteous villain. He has a purpose, like Magneto, he's looking out for his own. Zod just wants his planet back and his people and will do anything to get it.

Russell Crowe is sincere as Jor-El giving a meaningful performance.

Lawrence Fishburne and Diane Lane will have more to do in the sequels, I'm sure, but the real killer casting was Kevin Costner. His small role as Jonathan Kent is the father we all want in our lives. He sets the moral compass for Clark as a kid, and produces the most affecting scene in the movie, even if it is just a wave of the hand.

Superhero movies' standards are so high at this point in cinema. Could be The Dark Knight's fault? Could be because of Spiderman 3? But the leaps in the past few years have made the filmmakers to finally bring the basic heroes and villains together for a big bash. And its great! DC Comics has finally taken a page from Marvel. Man of Steel is a terrific film. I look forward to (hope) for the trilogy. Bring it on, Lex Luthor, Doomsday, Kryptonite. 

BRING IT!"
"Jun 7, 2012",NEUTRAL,This was way better than the last one. Didn't understand all of the useless destruction but whatever. Looking forward to Batman/Superman.
"Jun 7, 2012",NEUTRAL,"I had been dying to see this film ever since I saw the teaser for it last summer.  I did enjoy the film, for the most part, but it didn't live up to my expectations. I guess I was expecting it to be as good as The Dark Knight or The Dark Knight Rises. Don't get me wrong it's a good film, but not a great film; like last two Batman films. I felt the same way after seeing Batman Begins, though I loved it I still wanted more, and wasn't blown away by it. If the trend follows like the Batman sequels them I'm sure the next two Man Of Steel films will be amazing. 

All and all it's a good start to a brand new trilogy (I hope). With the success of the Man Of Steel film hopefully it will motivate the studios to make other DC hero films, and for a Justice League film as well."
"Jun 7, 2012",NEUTRAL,"All the action scenes were tons of fun, but it didn't feel like there was much of a plot. Almost seemed like a 2 and a half hour trailer."
"Jun 7, 2012",POSITIVE,As good as it gets. An awesome film well worth watching finally a superman I can watch time and again
"Jun 6, 2012",POSITIVE,"I loved it. Heard it wasn't as good as it could've been but thought it was great. But then I saw it at a theater with motion seats so I felt all the excitement and action, literally!"
"Jun 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,Waaaay too many inconsistencies prevented me from enjoying this movie to its fullest potential.
"Jun 6, 2012",POSITIVE,"Best superman yet, too much action at the end though."
"Jun 6, 2012",POSITIVE,A little different take on Superman with spectacular effects and action sequences.
"Jun 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,I have been looking forward to this movie for a long time. I am obsessed with Kal-El as a character and I have always had a bit of a soft spot for his stories. After the big disappointment that was Superman returns I have been aching for a good live action superman film for a long time. I enjoyed this movie because of the passion and hardwork that Zack Snyder put into this movie. I love Snyder as a director and his best movie by far is Watchmen but I think he managed to outdue himself visually with this movie. The action scenes were filmed wonderfully and the CGI was jaw dropping. Seeing Kal-el soar through the air at top speeds and fight Zod and his meancing thugs DBZ style was breathtaking. The plot was engaging but was dropped once the action began. On the plus side the           performances were solid. Amy adams fit the role of lois lane just as I though she would. Michael Shannon was a good general Zod and Russell Crowe was great as Jor-El. Henry Cavill is a good superman but Christopher reeves will always be better in my opinion. But This was still a good first start. I hope that the plot will thicken more in the sequel.
"Jun 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,Not that bad but not that good either. I'm expecting a new flavor and twist but I get none.
"Jun 6, 2012",POSITIVE,There's a lot of action and it is what I expected from a Z Snyder and C Nolan project. A little too dark perhaps for a Superman movie as there was little comedy or joyful tones/moments of the C Reeves movies. I loved what they did with Krypton and Russell Crow was a great Jorel.
"Jun 5, 2012",POSITIVE,Man of Steel was great hands down one of my favorite movie for this summer. F@ck the Critics
"Jun 5, 2012",POSITIVE,I love this movie so much.
"Jun 5, 2012",POSITIVE,"Henry Cavill makes the role his own and has the perfect mix of charm and muscle to fill Superman's boots. The movie moves along at a good pace with Russell Crowe good as Jor-El and though the ending doesn't subscribe to ""less is more"" and did begin to feel like a computer game, this IS Superman. He doesn't drive a car named after a winged rodent, he flies around like a God... So it's forgiven! A great return to form for the man who no longer wears underpants over his trooosers!"
"Jun 5, 2012",POSITIVE,"Obviously, some people and critics don't know a good Superman movie when they see one. Critics, seriously, think about what you are saying: you believe that ""Superman Returns"" is better than ""Man of Steel""? For once, I argue your opinion and these are the reasons why.
1. Action
Superman is no stranger to beating the living daylights out of villains. That was I wanted in ""Superman Returns"". What did I get? Superman lifting an island. For Superman, that is unacceptable as an action scene. But the Battle of Smallville is perhaps the best fight I've ever seen in my life. All the action, crazy as it seems, works unlike what others say, because it shows the reality of the situations. If super powered beings were to wage war on each other, cities will level. Sad, yes. True, also yes.
2. Kal-El and Lois Romance
Ok, this is something a friend of mine brought up in his review. He believed that the romance between Lois and Kal was ""forced"". Did it feel that way? At times, but it wasn't Spider-Man where you had Peter in this convoluted love story. This was a intro to the entire Lois/Clark thing. That simple.
3. 3D 
Another point brought up. The movie, apparently, had nauseating 3D. To this statement I say, nay. The scene with Superman flying had some of the coolest 3D I've seen this year. The final battle between Superman and General Zod(who, in my opinion, should've said something related to kneeling before Zod) also had some impressive 3D. 
4. Death of Zod(SPOILER ALERT!)
Here we go, the elephant in the Superman room. At the end of ""Man of Steel"", Superman has Zod in a headlock, but Zod feels obligated to fry this family, forcing Superman to choose: that family lives or Zod lives. Superman, knowing he's in a situation, decides he had to kill Zod. There has been loads of controversy about this scene. Here's  the thing: Superman had no choice. People say that he would never kill anyone. Superman purists will know that on more than one occasion, accidental or purposeful, the Man of Steel has killed people. That's what people fail to recognize, is that Superman was put in a no win situation. And for all those noobs who say he won't kill anyone in anything, and the Richard Donner movies are the Superman movies, keep in mind 2 things: 1. Superman did actually kill General Zod in ""Superman II"", tossing him off the Fortress of Solitude, and 2. This sets up the fact that he won't kill anyone. When Zod dies, Superman doesn't flip him off and fly away like an Internet troll, he falls to the ground and yelled in rage and pain."
"Jun 5, 2012",POSITIVE,"Better than the last Movie, but overall I like the movie"
"Jun 5, 2012",POSITIVE,"bold and ambitious right from the word go. This isn't the Superman we've seen before. Henry Cavil is amazing as Superman in what can't quite be described solely as a superhero movie. Some parts drag but the action and Henry Cavil and Amy Adams make this a must see. Marvel take note, this is how you do it!"
"Jun 5, 2012",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed it. I appreciated the updated and detailed origin story of Kal-El and Zod. I liked the flashbacks to Clark's childhood. There were several funny moments. The fight scenes were pretty good, even though Metropolis/New York was destroyed again. I liked the LexCorp and Wayne Enterprises Easter eggs and I'm looking forward to the next movie."
"Jun 5, 2012",POSITIVE,"I went to the midnight showing and that movie was really great, fast paced and lots of action. A must see on the big screen."
"Jun 4, 2012",POSITIVE,"don't be fooled by the ""critic"" reviews. this is the best super hero movie, actually, best movie I've seen in a looooooong time. this tops anything marvel or DC have ever made. production value, acting, all top notch. critics don't like it because it's not a love story, or because it's not campy like avengers. wow, watch and enjoy this unique film."
"Jun 4, 2012",NEUTRAL,"I feel like Henry Cavill really embodies the character of Clark Kent. He did an excellent job. I'm not sure I agree with the choice of Lois Lane. I love Amy Adams but I just still can't see her as Lois. I also think the cinematography was great but it seemed too fast if that makes sense. Anyway, if there is a sequel I would follow it."
"Jun 4, 2012",POSITIVE,Tom Welling.. Is and always will be the Superman!!
"Jun 4, 2012",POSITIVE,"como fanatico de superman, la pelicula es espectacular!!! como amante al cine le falta fuerza a la historia, los personajes no logran desarrollarse y mostrarse mas, sin embargo es una resurreccion de mi super heroe favorito, y muy bien llevado a la pantalla grande"
"Jun 3, 2012",POSITIVE,Superman is here really good good movie today i am going for third time.
"Jun 3, 2012",NEGATIVE,It was all over the place I can't believe Christopher Nolan worked on this.  I am a big Superman fan and am really disappointed in this movie.  They tried to cram too much into the reboot and ended up with a bunch of crap and buzz marketing of Ihop.
"Jun 3, 2012",POSITIVE,"a great, fresh perspective on the Superman lore. I would have loved more development on Clark as a child and romance between him and Lois but overall, this was a great interpretation of the beginnings of Superman. And a big theme of the movie to me was: he's new at this, and somewhat unsure of himself, which I liked a lot."
"Jun 3, 2012",POSITIVE,"Not perfect by any means, but definitely worthwhile. Henry Cavill did a tremendous job as the Man of Steel. I'm completely sold on him and couldn't be happier with the foundation that's been set. Great performances by Michael Shannon, Russel Crowe, Kevin Costner, and Diane Lane, as well as the supporting cast, with the standout being Antje Traue's fiercely menacing portrayal of Faora. Some script issues, and Snyder's insistence on chaotic and relentless CGI action were my chief complaints. I would have enjoyed a bit more character work and a few less explosions or collapsing skyscrapers. Here's hoping he learns a lesson in subtlety for the next outing. Still, an exciting new universe has been established, with a fully formed and truly bad ass Superman at it's core."
"Jun 2, 2012",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel is the best Superman Film Ever. Zack Snyder, Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer have done a great job on this one, looking foward to see part 2."
"Jun 2, 2012",NEUTRAL,"As a Superman fan, I gotta say I was disappointed. Can you tell a Hulk story without Bruce Banner? No. Neither should you tell a decent Superman story without Clark Kent. 

That said, Henry Cavill is a great Kal El and I loved Amy Adams as Lois! Great casting. I just don't think this fascination in Hollywood with showing a ""darker side"" of superheroes works with Superman."
"Jun 2, 2012",POSITIVE,As a Superman fan it is everything that I wanted to see in a Rebooted Franchise..General Audiences may not love it though.
"Jun 2, 2012",POSITIVE,Kal-El soars in this reboot!!!
"Jun 2, 2012",POSITIVE,"Slightly off based and changed from traditional superman but I expected that. Good action, good movie."
"Aug 4, 2008",NEUTRAL,"Tough call on this one. Worked more than it didn't, but the Kryptonian mayhem overshadowed the attention given to the core essence of Superman resulting in a mightily flawed film."
"Aug 2, 2008",NEUTRAL,"Flawed, but good lord are we treated to an incredible spectacle! It's not the best Superman movie, but it's certainly the best since Superman II. It takes some ballsy tweaks to the original source material, while still staying true to its roots and even does something fairly bold in the end. The action is nothing short of spectacular as we are treated to gods duking it out in glorious epic battles. I dig the new take on the cinematic version of Zod, who is played as a patriotic Kryptonian warrior instead of a pompous aristocrat, which is more faithful to the Post-Crisis Zod. This movie definitely represents the Post-Crisis Superman where as the Donner/SInger films represented the Pre-Crisis era which is more light hearted, which honestly this movie could have used. Which in lies the biggest problem with Man of Steel, Superman. Henry Cavill has the potential to be an amazing Superman, he's got the look and ability to act,  but Snyder doesn't know what to do with him. Superman needs to be a beacon of hope and represent the best of what humanity can be, and unfortunately none of that is present here."
"Jul 25, 2008",POSITIVE,"this movie was really good! it started the best ride ever. the superman escape roller coaster, then came all the superman shirts and jackets. awsome movie!"
"Jul 22, 2008",POSITIVE,"A masterpiece, pure and simple.  Sure, you can nitpick it here and there, but this is still one of the best live action experiences available at the moment for a Superman film.  I just love it."
"Jul 21, 2008",POSITIVE,"I loved this film. There were things I didn't like such as how he came about his suit when everyone from Krypton seems to wear dark clothing and battle armor but all things together this was my favorite Superman film. Henry Cavill was awesome and it was nice how they took things we saw in the Smallville tv series, such as learning to adapt to budding powers and not being a born fighter, and added them in to show his growth and reluctance to reveal himself. He has not yet grown to be the protector we all know so he is not careful about his surroundings while fighting and many structures get pulverized and I'm sure many people get hurt. Rebooting Superman and not having Christopher Reeves seemed like a bad idea to me; but I am very happy with the final product."
"Jul 15, 2008",NEUTRAL,"Before I officially unwrap my thoughts surrounding Zack Snyder's latest CGI-indulgence, let me start off by clarifying that I've never been much of a Superman fan. Not even during my childhood years, at the height of all comic-book consumption. I've repeatedly analyzed why that is and have come to the conclusion that A) quasi-immortal protagonists make for poor suspense, B ) morally ideal is not the same as viscerally ideal and C) the suit, no matter how ""justified"" by explanatory exposition, still enters my eyes as cheesy and dated. 

Personally, I've always held a preference towards more relatable superheroes like Batman and Spider-Man. Characters that actually have something in common with real-life human beings, vulnerable and traumatized by profound emotional experiences, which at points throughout their lives pushes them dangerously close to breaking point and corruption of their core values. There's darkness in their souls; an ever-going inner conflict regarding identity, self-interests and the obligation to always do the right thing when society calls for aid. Whereas Superman, well, he's just too benign and goody-two-shoes to ever fly outside our forecasts. 

Hope steadily ascended, however, as news came my way of a darker, more realistic Superman, guided by the masterful influence of the King Midas of comic-book adaptations, Christopher Nolan. Trailers arrived and looked progressively more exhilarating, to the point where I felt confident enough to believe that this could be the <i>The Dark Knight</i> of Superman yarns. Well, wasn't I the fool. 

In the very long lists of mistakes that were made, hiring David S. Goyer to pen the screenplay would have to be numero uno. Flat and lifeless, his lackluster dialogues renders one almost completely apathetic as to the denouement of the storyline. Who lives and dies; I couldn't care less by the end. It makes me curious as to what Goyer was thinking before he put his fingers to his keyboard; conjuring up the vision of a bonafide hack. I imagine though it went something like this: ""Those Batman films by Nolan, they're successful right? Let's make it dark and brooding like those. Let's scrap all sense of fun and have all the characters converse as if their grandma just died. That is sure to bestow the sophistication that modern audiences so desires"".

EHH! Wrong. I wanted to love this film, I honestly did. But when Snyder adds insult to injury by drowning the narrative in over-the-top, Michael Bay-esque special effects, I couldn't help but relate to the millions of citizens who were unfortunate to stand in the blast zone of Snyder's rain of mayhem and destruction. Compliments of the man in cape, whom all the while seems more concerned about beating his nemesis into next Tuesday than actually, you know, save lives. 

Now, before this review gets too cranky, I do have some good things to say, regarding why I still enjoyed the film, shortcomings notwithstanding. One is the prologue in Krypton, which I thought launched the film on a high note and filled a void that I wished earlier iterations would have furthermore explored. The new sci-fi approach fell to my taste as well, along with the superb visual design, which I absolutely admired. Those parts they got marvelously right. And I would be lying if I said that I wasn't entertained. Even if ""entertained"" here means the equivalent of your average summer action flick. 

Then there's the horribly miscast Amy Adams as Lois Lame. The synthetic acting (with but a few exceptions), the absolute dryness of which instills the characters with a robotic demeanor of sorts; as if programmed by aliens who just barely scored a D on their human interaction test. Henry Cavill, I must say, carries himself pretty well though, despite being a ""Man of No Feels"". I was also fairly engrossed by the performance of Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent; disregarding the notion that he chiefly just seemed to be there to recite the big book of generic father-to-son speeches. Michael Shannon as General Zod I thought would be something to look forward to, but regrettably he became another victim of David S. Goyer's lack of passion. 

""Impersonal"" is the word that lies closest to mind when I look back at this film in retrospect. It had every reason to be a winner - the cast, the director, music god Hans Zimmer at the helm of the soundtrack - but somehow lost itself in a mind-numbing blur of CGI and squandered potential. A result to which I can only say: 

It's a bird! It's a plane! It's the biggest letdown of the year!

"Jul 1, 2008",POSITIVE,The Movie was Awesome! Excellent reintroduction to the character. Plenty of fantastic action and an intriguing story. Can't wait to go see it again!
"Jun 28, 2008",NEUTRAL,"Though I liked it overall, I find myself a little frustrated by Man of Steel.  On one hand, it has some excellent pathos and character development, but on the other hand, it leaves an unsettling taste in my mouth. 

First, the good.  Michael Shannon is excellent as Zod, who is given a reason for being the way and doing what he does.  That reason even kind of makes sense at times, though he takes things too far.  The film is incredibly well cast overall.  Russell Crowe, who is about 50/50 with me, is perfectly at home as Jor-El, and I loved each and every scene with Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent.  I loved almost all of the Smallville sequences, as this is one of the most fascinating parts of the Superman mythos to me.  Henry Cavill is perfectly chiseled (how does he shave, though?) and believable when presented with his various character struggles, coping with being outcast, with having powers, with not being able to use them when he feels inclined to do so, deciding whether or not to go public, and handling the government's mistrust of him gracefully (the fact that it's called Man of Steel is very telling).  Amy Adams is fine as Lois Lane, which is not an easy part to play.  It remains to be seen whether she and Cavill have chemistry, as they share only a few scenes.  The special effects and art direction are well executed, though they don't bring much new to the table.  I also loved how Superman's powers were relatively limited compared to how invincible he was in Superman Returns.  You won't see any bullets bouncing off eyeballs in this one, and Superman can be worked to the point of exhaustion.  I also enjoyed the little touches of including Lana Lang and Pete Ross in a couple of short Smallville scenes, having Lexcorp trucks show up throughout, and making Zod's female minion look an awful lot like Sarah Douglas's sexy-but-sinister Ursa from Superman II.

While I was very happy with things from a character development perspective, I couldn't get on board for some of the plot, especially the parts involving the endless super-fights in Smallville (IHOP and Sears will never be the same) and Metropolis.  This seems to be a pretty common problem that viewers have had with the film; the fights become a little tedious and boring at times.  It felt very familiar, since The Avengers did much of the same with New York City in their film.  However, that was kept exciting by the fact that we got to see the fight from several characters' perspectives.  This time, it just feels like an excuse to show how Hollywood has perfected visual effects involving toppling buildings and explosions, all while managing to not show a single human casualty on-screen.  Seriously, tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of people must have died as collateral damage in those fights.  I know it's just a movie, but it doesn't fit with Superman.  As he did when he got in over his head in the Metropolis fight in Superman II with Christopher Reeve, Superman should take the fight away from Metropolis, thus keeping the masses of humans out of peril.  If he's not going to do that, then the film, being the gritty reboot that it is, needs to address this, and hold Superman accountable for all of the damage done and lives lost.  Another complaint is that Kal-El's/Clark's mother figures don't get much of a voice.  Diane Lane is fine as Martha Kent, who provides Clark with a home and motherly comfort, but I can't help but feel bad for Lara, Kal-El's Krypton mother.  She gave birth to him in the first natural Kryptonian birth in centuries, and she doesn't get much of a say on his upbringing.  Why couldn't Jor-El upload HER memories and essence into a nifty Kryptonian key, too?

Maybe I'm reading into it too much, but dagnabbit, Superman is very dear to me.  Superman I and II are among my earliest film-watching memories and, flawed though they may be, they always stayed true to the character.  I'd certainly see it again, and look forward to watching more of the Superman presented in this reboot.  Despite my problems with it, I really did like it, and would love to see what comes next in this version of Superman's world."
"Jun 28, 2008",POSITIVE,It hasn't even been filmed yet and it has become my favorite. I can't wait for this movie to come out!! SUPERMAN IS THE BEST!!!! :)
"Jun 24, 2008",NEGATIVE,"It's better than SUPERMAN RETURNS but that's not saying much.¬† Cavill makes a decent Clark/Kal-El (""Superman"" isn't acknowledged in the end titles), and Diane Lane acquits herself nicely as Martha Kent, but Amy Adams is an awful Lois (Lois Lame might be a more appropriate name for her character), and Laurence Fishburne's Perry White (complete with earring!  ) is more Frank Langella than Jackie Cooper.¬† The one casting choice I had high hopes for was Michael Shannon as Zod, and while he brings a great deal of menace to the proceedings, he lacks the calm, cool confidence of Terence Stamp's interpretation.¬† Perhaps modern audiences expect their villains to be over-the-top bad asses with no shades of grey, and if that's the case, then this new Zod delivers.¬† Christoper Meloni, one of my favourite LAW & ORDER actors, has a nice supporting role as an army officer.

But my main quibble with the film is the way it approaches the action sequences.¬† Perhaps I'm out of step with the times, but I don't see the point in making a SUPERMAN movie where it's painfully obvious all the actors are standing in front of a green screen and the ""epic"" digital action is out of focus and cut with attention deficit sufferers in mind.¬† When Christopher Reeve played Superman, you could actually see his derring-do whereas in MAN OF STEEL the action is cut so quickly you have to guess.¬† Also, the Kryptonian architects were most definitely inspired by H.R. Giger this time out, so it's little wonder Jor-El and the Missus had no interest in raising a child in such a dark and uninviting environment.¬† One last note:¬† I'm glad they didn't try to tack the Williams SUPERMAN theme onto this as it wouldn't have worked, but Hans Zimmer completely misses the mark with his score for MAN OF STEEL.¬†"
"Jun 19, 2008",POSITIVE,"the story was a mix of all the previous superman movies, brain singer is a good story teller but his  movies are slow like in superman returns litteraly there was no action , the same old story with no new characters are introduced.Hope the next one will have more action sequence as compare to the Superman returns with characters like doomsday perhaps"
"Jun 14, 2008",NEUTRAL,"I Thought It Was Great! It was pretty much the Superman film I think movie goers wanted. 

It has flaws but for the most part it was still Great"
"Jun 14, 2008",POSITIVE,"I think the word for the action here is ""bombastic"". It'll leave you breathless with the sheer tonnage of special effects and spectacular sequences. It's a touch light on plot development but basically with this one you just want to strap on a seatbelt, hold onto your hat and enjoy the ride. What a ride it is too. One question though - when are we ever going to see a genuinely hot Lois Lane?"
"May 30, 2008",NEGATIVE,"Second Impression: Yeah, its bad. Zack Snyder, stop making your fanboyish dreams more embarrassing than they are."
"May 9, 2008",POSITIVE,i will give it a 4 star as ut not out till 2009
"May 8, 2008",NEGATIVE,"With all the potential this film had, it really saddened me that it fell so bloody flat. Sigh. What a wase of Kevin Spacey..."
"Apr 20, 2008",NEUTRAL,"Jonathan Kent:  You just have to decide what kind of man you want to grow up to be, Clark. Whoever that man is, he's going to change the world.

We'll always have Superman: The Movie.  While Superman has arguably been the most recognizable superhero since his creation in 1938 and has remained a national icon, the 1978 film from Richard Donner seems to be the only time cinema had truly done its best to do him justice, let alone be the film that created the template (still in use) for a majority of superhero movies.  Superman II is a great example as well, though that film is practically the second half of the first, given that it was part of one big story and shot back-to-back with the first film.  For whatever reason, other attempts at a Superman film just cannot seem to do anything else that is interesting with the character, regardless of spectacle, the cast involved, or whoever may be directing or producing.  Man of Steel is the best Superman film since the first two Christopher Reeve films, but it still ends up waving off some of the more interesting ideas in favor of letting us see super fights on an enormous scale and settling for bursts of emotional content, amidst an unfocused story.  As a person who already does not find Superman to be any more fascinating than the story written around him, the potential for this newest iteration to explore the character is downplayed, despite the film still playing out as a visually stimulating experience in the realm of big summer blockbusters.

"Mar 23, 2008",POSITIVE,This was Awesome!!! I fully enjoyed it.
"Mar 14, 2008",POSITIVE,"Hugely enjoyable reboot of the Superman legend. Director Zack Snyder (more than making up for the debacle of his last film, Sucker Punch) & Dark Knight Trilogy collaborators Christopher Nolan & David S. Goyer create a realistic world for the *ahem* man of steel to fly faster than a speeding bullet in by asking the questions, ""What if Superman was real? What if he actually exist? How would the world react?"" The action is loud & always exciting & the emotional core of the story stays on the right side of smaltzy sentiment as well. The performances from everyone involved more than serves the purpose with Michael Shannon having lots of fun chewing up the scenery (as well destroying the hell out of it too). My one criticism? The post conversion 3D treatment. It wasn't really noticeable & certainly didn't enhance the action in any way. That said, this is a proper summer blockbuster film & with the sequel already in the works, the future looks bright for this reimagining of the son of Jor-El."
"Mar 14, 2008",POSITIVE,"Finally a Superman movie that cuts the camp and delivers the goods!  This is no Christopher Reeve Superman, which makes this its own movie.  Great film, definitely worth the watch.  Forget the critics, they wanted Lois and Clark."
"Mar 13, 2008",POSITIVE,"Superbly cast and well-acted, great action, good score, and a satisfying ending. Some lacking dialogue but overall it is the best Superman film. Critics are a little TOO critical."
"Mar 2, 2008",POSITIVE,"Superman is back, baby. For REAL, this time. This new film gives the ""Batman Begins"" treatment to DC's (if not the world's) most iconic superhero, examining his motivations and plunging him into a realistic world filled with moral uncertainty... a world in desperate need of a symbol of hope. And while it doesn't <i>entirely</i> succeed as a character study in the way that Nolan's first Batman film did, it does make up the difference by being just about the BIGGEST GODDAMN SUPERHERO SPECTACLE EVER MADE.

Man of Steel is a clean-slate restart of the Superman franchise, dispensing with the baggage of the previous films and giving us a Supes closer to the comic books than any other live-action iteration before (though whether that's a <i>good</i> thing is a matter of personal taste). Produced by Nolan himself and written by David Goyer (writer of the Dark Knight trilogy, of course), Man of Steel was starting right out the gate with some ridiculous expectations attached to it (like, ""holy crap, it's the second coming!"" level expectations). Making things harder to get a read on, though, was the choice of Zack ""Sucker Punch"" Snyder as the director; sure, the man's hyper-charged visual sensibilities seem perfect for the Last Son of Krypton, but he's a shallow filmmaker with a love for slow motion that borders on creepy fetishism. Amazingly, though, the mash-up of the cerebral Nolan/Goyer writing team and Snyder's visceralist style has proven to be a match of peanut-butter-and-chocolate proportions. Their approach to the icon is refreshingly different and satisfyingly sci-fi; rather than considering Superman as a superhero first and an alien later, they frame his origins in the context of ""what if an extraterrestrial possessing these powers actually appeared in our world?"" Adding to the cocktail of awesome is the use of General Zod as the villain, whose invasion of Earth in a Kryptonian starship basically turns the third act into a huge-scale disaster film-- like Independence Day, but if one of the aliens was a good guy. The filmmakers have finally shed the shackles of pre-conceived expectation that have weighed down Superman since Donner defined the character in 1978, giving us a hero who isn't perfect and a world that isn't black and white, but without losing that spark of hope and that soul of decency that makes the Man of Steel who he is. In short, they finally, FINALLY gave us a <i>human</i> Superman.

The film opens where every Superman origin story has to open: the doomed planet Krypton, where scientist Jor-El tries to warn the decrepit council of elders that their planet is about to explode. Before he can do much of anything, however, General Zod stages a coup, and Jor-El is forced to send his infant son, Kal-El (the first naturally-born child on Krypton in centuries), to the planet Earth to save him. Flash-forward thirty-three years, and we meet a grown Kal-El, known on Earth as Clark Kent, as he wanders from menial job to menial job, adrift in the world and unsure of his place in it. Whenever there's danger, however, Clark steps in and saves the day, disappearing before anyone can ask any questions. Through flashbacks, we learn about his discovery by Jonathan and Martha Kent, and see some of the formative moments of his life. Soon, however, he discovers an ancient Kryptonian scout ship in glacial ice, and learns of his true ancestry... but not before intrepid reporter Lois Lane stumbles upon him and he saves her life. Lois leaks an unpublished article about her mysterious savior online, and actually <i>tracks Clark Kent down</i>... but she agrees not to out him to the world, because the world isn't ready. Then, of course, the choice is taken out of their hands: General Zod shows up, announcing his presence to the planet and demanding the return of Kal-El in twenty-four hours... <i>or else</i>. Turns out Zod and his cronies survived the destruction of Krypton because their coup failed, and they were sentenced to the Phantom Zone-- only to be released by the planet's annihilation. Clark, left with no other choice, announces his presence to mankind (now clad in full Kryptonian regalia from the scout ship, so he's pretty much Superman) by turning himself in to the U.S. government, who turn him over to Zod. But Zod has bigger plans than just recapturing Kal-- it turns out that Jor-El hid a registry containing the entire genetic make-up of the Kryptonian people in Superman's cell structure, and Zod wants to extract the registry from him... so he can rebuild Krypton on Earth. Superman escapes from Zod's ship, but Zod retaliates by unleashing a terraforming device on the unsuspecting planet-- one that will transform Earth into a new Krypton by increasing the gravity and destroying every living thing on the surface. Can Superman stop him in time to save all of humankind?

Well, duh-- he's <i>Superman</i>.

The cast in this film is on par with (if not a little better than) the cast from Donner's original. To begin with, Henry Cavill IS Superman-- so much so that it's almost scary. (more to come)"
"Feb 22, 2008",POSITIVE,Was scared it was moving too fast for a bit buy they brought it back to a good pace. The new twist on Jonathan was a great decision and connects us to the challenges Clark faces with humanity. Great fight scenes and can't wait for the next one.
"Feb 12, 2008",POSITIVE,"A huge step up in quality & action from its predecessor (""Superman Returns""). There are some obvious issues with plot, but overall this is a great superhero flick. Cavill was born to be Superman, and Shannon is great as the film's villain."
"Feb 11, 2008",POSITIVE,"Compared to what 'Superman Returns' offered in 2006, 'Man of Steel' come back with a stronger power to drawn the audiences attention by having a well-named director and incredible cast with a more interesting story too.. Henry Cavill gave a strong performance as Clark Kent with another lovely performance from Amy Adams as Lois Lane, but the star of this movie is no other than Michael Shannon who successfully as before portraying a ruthless villain in the name of General Zod.. Overall, since I haven't watched the original Superman in 1980's, this version is way better than 'Superman Returns' but just good not that great nor amazing.."
"Feb 7, 2008",NEGATIVE,"Dull, humourless, ponderous slog. Amy Adams is the one shining light but doesn't have much of a role. Snooze."
"Feb 3, 2008",POSITIVE,"This movie was the cliff notes to Smallville. It's storyline layout was nearly identical to Batman Begins. Superman once is portrayed was again as a Christ figure with several illusions and symbols foreshadowing Kal's ultimate destiny. This film wasn't flashy. A dark loomy setting. No John Williams music to usher in, ""it's a bird, it's a plane, it's Superman!"" All that being said, a fantastic movie who's greatness will not fully be appreciated until other films are built off of it. This film laid the foundation for what could be another amazing series of films from the DC Universe."
"Jan 30, 2008",NEGATIVE,"Nice try... But you all missed the point. And, wow, serious pacing problems.

Edit: The screenwriters of the last one are gone... Good, good. Now all we have to do is get Singer and Bosworth fired and this film could actually be pretty good."
"Jan 29, 2008",POSITIVE,I love Superman! Call me a geek but oh well.
"Jan 19, 2008",POSITIVE,I don't understand all the indifference to this movie. It was an amazing spectacle of a movie. We asked for more action in a Superman film and we got it. I loved the hell out of this movie. 58% it should be 158%!
"Jan 8, 2008",NEGATIVE,This was overhyped and totally blows!
"Jan 5, 2008",NEUTRAL,"For a Superman movie, it was better than I thought it would be. The tone and look felt more like the Batman movies but it didn't seem out of place.
The special effects were great and the acting choices, for the most part, were good.
Not too keen on Amy Adams as Lois Lane, she didn't seem to suit the role.
Glad they didn't use Kryptonite and that the villain wasn't Lex Luthor, though they allude to his character.
Superman was involved with destroying a lot of property, which also killed a lot of people and yet he went bonkers when Zod was going to kill a family of four."
"Dec 29, 2007",POSITIVE,IF its superman then its awesome
"Dec 27, 2007",POSITIVE,The definitive Superman film. The most entertaining and thoughtful action movie where I literally gasped at the ending. Absolutely fantastic.
"Dec 18, 2007",POSITIVE,it better be good!!!!!!!!!!!
"Dec 17, 2007",POSITIVE,can't wait for this one
"Dec 6, 2007",POSITIVE,"As someone who has grown up as a life-long fan of this and other classic superheroes, having a modern take on Superman was something that needed to be done. For the most part, Zack Snyder's ""Man of Steel"" delivers on its promise of having film catch up to Superman. Henry Cavill turns in a great performance, along with other cast members Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburn, Michael Shannon, Russell Crowe, Diane Lane, and Kevin Costner who make up the cast of characters. There's a lot more action than you can shake a fist at, and while many argue it's excessive, after ""Superman Returns"" it was welcomed by me."
"Dec 5, 2007",POSITIVE,CANNOT WAITTTTTTTTT!
"Nov 26, 2007",POSITIVE,Can't wait to see it!
"Nov 25, 2007",POSITIVE,I'TS A NICE MOVIE!!!
"Nov 21, 2007",NEUTRAL,I liked some of the explanation they used to explain why Superman is the way he is. Some things I found I bit silly but all in all a good flick. A bit long though.
"Nov 20, 2007",POSITIVE,please give superman somebody interesting to fight   GOT-DAMMIT
"Nov 18, 2007",POSITIVE,"Man of Steel is the film that fans of Batman Begins have been waiting for, and indeed, may have been expecting in 2006's Superman Returns. To be sure, this is the best Superman film since 1978's Superman: The Movie. And the finger prints of the cast and crew of the Dark Knight Trilogy are all over this. Which makes since, as the production team, score, story and screenplay are all ported over from the recently concluded saga of Batman. The film's narrative, or back story, more specifically, relies on our familiarity with the Superman mythos.  Instead of being overtly force fed it, we are told it through key flashbacks (think something akin to LOST) and considering the ground covered (the film weighs in at 2 and a half hours) it still feels like they left alot on the cutting room floor. Henry Cavill is an excellent Superman, if still inferior to Christopher Reeve. Michael Shannnon's Zod is also pale in the shadow of the incomparable Terrance Stamp. (Superman II's General Zod.) The most positive thing I can say about the movie is that I wanted to see it again after I left. I felt the same pinge of anticipation when I left the midnight screening of Batman Begins I attended in 2005. Although existing in two different universes, many will rightfully view this as a companion to that series. Zack Snyder does a serviceable job of directing, lending most of the credence to the bombastic and epic, if ultimately tiresome, action set pieces. Goyer's realistic take on DC's men of myth is at work here again, though sadly without the deft touch and subtle eye of Christopher Nolan (though Nolan did produce the film.) This film will give any fan of summer tent poles reason to rejoice. After the more somber meditation and less combative Superman Returns, this will give audiences weened on the more action oriented Marvel universe, something to enjoy. Warner Bros. has not constructed the perfect Superman film, but the did at least make an exceptional one."
"Nov 18, 2007",POSITIVE,seriosly awsome because the man of steel is coolio
"Nov 10, 2007",POSITIVE,"S stands for Grand

No Cinema summer is complete without jersey clad men with super powers, saving cities from becoming ashes. How fitting then that the Man of Steel comes back, 75 years after his debut in comic book form. But forget the films or TV series you've seen. This rebirth, in the hands of Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder, is confident, intense and full of blacks. A worthy companion to ""Batman Begins.""
In a parallel universe, on a planet much like our own, is now ready to launch a second sequel to ""Superman Returns,"" Bryan Singer's underrated homage / continuation of the playful original films with Christopher Reeve. Sadly, not by us, for which many saw a nostalgic adventure with potential, nojade Hollywood bosses at the lack of speed, fighter and dollars at the box office.
How to do it where everyone does now, a reboot, where ""boot"" is the boot that kicks away all traces of previous incarnations. Instead of colorful comic book fun and J√∂nssonligan villains he'll now be transformed into an earthy and realistic hero in a dark and violent world.
It worked out great for Batman. And you know what, it works damn good for Stalis.
From the first war torn scenes on a doomed Krypton noticed that this story has not been told before. Not this way. In broad terms, is much the same: the planet is fucked, a concerned father and mother sends his infant son to Earth, where he must survive, and with luck spread peace among his fellows. Well aware that we're talking science fiction outer space, this is still a focus on some sort of realism. No debilitating kryptonite, no magic crystals visible to the entire film.
Young Mr. aliens crash on the Kent backyard in Kansas, where Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are living childless but happy. They hang laundry, meckar with the car and pepper the outcast with livsr√•d while growing up. It's tough enough being a teenager and struggling with puberty, but add super hearing and inhuman strength on it ... Clark, who he called, has a lot to sort out inside.
A hefty chunk of the film is allowed to put the character, his strengths and weaknesses, and what drives him. Back looks to childhood's key scenes in Smallville interspersed with the present, where Henry Cavill wanders about in search of himself. After all, unexpectedly exciting, especially when his cross paths with curious metropolitan reporter Lois Lane and her many questions. What does it mean to be a lonely alien on earth? Growing up with supernatural powers and do not know anything about its origins? Here we dive deep into the things that the previous ""Superman"" films only hinted at.
I understand that it sounds really boring for some, and the action-goers also get their due. The second half of the film, also a generous playing time, dedicated to the spectacular clashes on the ground and in space. Krypton General Zod (Michael Shannon) has namely followed suit, with the plan to destroy the world and wipe out our people as if he were someone Lex Luthor.
Once it breaks loose is no Metropolis scratch proof. Anyone been to the cinema for the occasional bold blockbuster recent years will recognize themselves, CGI cavalcade could be clipped together of highlights from ""Transformers 3"" to ""The Avengers."" Fortunately, it has plenty of gunpowder, variety and cool villains that it should not be too tough. Superman's strengths and his limitations, makes itself known in earnest.
Christopher Nolan, the creator of the ridiculously successful ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, is the producer and monitors the process. It will be safer that way. God forbid that Zack Snyder is too much Zack Snyder, with its fablesse of violence and blood. Here it creates 11-√•rsunderh√•llning with possibility - strike, demanding - several sequels. One can not afford to again MUFF IT away such an important franchise as America's first and greatest superhero. No danger of that, the movie is already successful and Cavill will probably have to incur the suit at least two more times. I would like to see more.
It's probably on the other hand, nothing you take the kids on a rainy summer evening. With his game length of 2.30 and zero humor is clearly not a family adventure you are aiming for. Rather, the ""Man of Steel"" is a worthy companion to ""Batman Begins,"" if we're talking heavy, a little too long but overall very promising new interpretations of classic comic book heroes.
He is no longer a mantle clad rock star at the Daily Planet's cover, rather a new Jesus who came down to earth and waiting for the right moment to save us all from evil. Dangerously close religious, yet fascinating and nicely. We all know about Superman and his background, but it has not been portrayed in this way before, so that is also a regular strawberry that you and I can relate and feel something, not just amused by the spectacle on the silver screen. And above all it is a reinterpretation that dares to write about a beloved superhero story (watch and learn, Marc Webb's Spider-Man).
The 'S' on his chest is kryptonska for ""hope."" On our planet, it stands for Spectacular, Juicy Summer Adventure-Special burger with extra mustard and sprinkles. Superman is back. And Kate Bosworth once wrote in his rag is a thing of the past - the world needs him.

<Jor-El: What are you doing Zod? This is madness!
General Zod:   What I should have done years ago. These lawmakers with their endless debates, have led krypton to ruin!
Jor-El: And if your forces prevail? You'll be the leader of nothing!
General Zod:   Then join me, help me save our race. We'll start a new, we'll sever the degenerative bloodline that led us to this state.
Jor-El: And who will decide which bloodline survives on, you?</>"
