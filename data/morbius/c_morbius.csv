"Mar 24, 2024",NEUTRAL," After multiple delays, Morbius, the “highly anticipated” new entry into Sony’s Spider-Man Universe, arrives with some of the worst world-building we have seen in a long time.  During the last couple of years, Sony has been trying to find their box office-hit franchise for almost the past decade. Even in the past three years, you could see their many attempts at a franchise–throwing them to a wall, waiting to see what stuck. While most of them don’t have the punch to stand independently. the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man will never fail them. Some good has come from that venture, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, albeit some bad arrived with it as well, Venom. After the 2018 symbiote “romp”, they didn’t know where to go next. So, their next big move was to “exploit” the rights and make a film about multiple characters to create their own universe – the supporting cast of villains who clearly don’t deserve a solo project. Currently, they have numerous projects at the ready: Kraven the Hunter, Madame Web, Black Cat, Silver Sable, Silk, you name it. Out of all those projects, Sony decided to go with Morbius, the living vampire. And after its multiple delays (it was initially going to be released in July of 2020), it’s finally here.  The film centers around a biochemist named Michael Morbius (Jared Leto), who had a troubled past dealing with a rare blood disease. The only way to tend to this disease is through blood transfusions three times a day. Morbius’ main goal in life, thanks to his unique gift of excellent knowledge, is to find a cure for it so that his best friend, Milo aka. Lucian (Matt Smith, whose pantomime performance steals the show and makes the film partly tolerable) can live an everyday life. Morbius has “found” the solution to all of his problems thanks to some “vampire” bats found in a hidden cave. After multiple tests with rats, he decides it’s time for a human guinea pig to take on the trial: himself. When his experimentation goes wrong, he inadvertently injects himself with a form of vampirism that cures his ailments but causes a side effect: the thirst for blood. All of this sounds somewhat compelling for it to be a solo project, albeit, with the Marvel tag on it, everybody knows there isn’t going to be much breathing space for creativity. And indeed, that is what happens – this is the most precise definition of a “product” rather than an actual film.  The first part of the story is interesting enough for the viewer to hang on for the ride as it deals with a morally complex character, thanks to his ethics regarding science. As he mentions multiple times, Morbius says he will do anything to find the cure that curses him and his friend Milo. Nevertheless, once Michael gets his powers from injecting the bat-blood serum, everything worsens. Action sequences with shoddy graphics that look like they came from a cutscene of a PlayStation 3 game are followed by melodramatic conversations between him and his love interest, Martine (Adria Arjona, who is not given the best to work with), that don’t move the plot along. Things just happen in this film with no thought or context. One could have thought that there would be a “man or beast” scenario while dealing with how his morality shifts, but it isn’t close to such thematics. Another issue that I have, although it may be a minor one, is that there is no sight of blood in the picture. Multiple people are killed in this film, as well as the fact that it deals with vampires, yet there is no presence of it.  Even in the five to ten minutes that Morbius is experimenting with his vampiric tolerance and chugging gallons of blood, we don’t see the red fluid. There is a moment where a throat is supposedly slit open by one of his claws, albeit there is no wound. This sort of moment happens once or twice more during the feature’s runtime. For a film that is supposed to build up the Sony Spider-Man universe, there is no commitment to this character from the director and the production company. Morbius is supposed to be an introduction of a character, and it feels like a pre-curtain raiser for something “bigger” and “broader”. This isn’t the worst thing in the world, nor is it close to being it. I have seen way worse films in the past couple of years, and there are a handful of good aspects. Matt Smith chewing up the scenery for all that he’s worth makes the picture watchable, and I was rather engaged with the first couple of minutes, right until the superhero parts of the story kicked in. However, this type of movie devalues a “well-established” brand. It serves little to no purpose on its own–it’s only worth “something” when in union with its franchise. "
"Sep 17, 2023",NEGATIVE," Right off the bat (pun unintended), it needs to be said that Daniel Espinosa’s Morbius reeks of Sony trying to cash in on Marvel’s enormous audience appeal but with little to no understanding about what makes a comic book IP interesting or entertaining. It’s a film devoted to an antihero origin story, which gives us no reason to really care about the protagonist nor his ethical struggles. Dr. Michael Morbius was first introduced to the Spider-Man universe in 1971 by writers Roy Thomas and Gil Kane. Since then, he’s been a low-tier antihero who occasionally scuffles with Spider-Man as a sometimes friend and sometimes foe. Morbius is a man who suffers from guilt over his vampiric existence but can’t control his need for human blood. When we first meet the cinematic Dr. Michael Morbius, played lazily by Jared Leto, he is trying to cure the rare blood disease that is slowly killing him. He walks on crutches and is visibly decaying. He needs infusions of blood regularly to keep him alive. Despite his debilitating condition, he is also a Nobel Prize-winning biochemist, having invented a highly successful form of synthetic blood, and also a caring MD who watches over his chronically ill patients. Years of research have led him to believe that he can create a cure for his condition using the saliva of vampire bats as a way to create a coagulant to keep his blood from doing whatever it is that is killing him (none of this is really made clear in the script, we don’t actually know what the blood disease is). Added to his need to cure his own illness is the fact that his best friend since childhood, Milo (Matt Smith), is also suffering from the same condition. Time is running short for the two men, and Morbius is willing to go into the ethical grey areas to find a solution. Flashing back to Michael’s childhood, we meet the kindly doctor and mentor Emil Nikols (Jared Harris), who cared for the young Michael (Charlie Shotwell) and Milo (Joseph Esson) in a facility in Greece. Michael and Milo form a lifelong friendship, which is disrupted when Nikols recognizes Michael’s genius and suggests he study in a prestigious New York school. Left behind and at the mercy of bullies, Milo opens himself up to resentment. Years later, he too has relocated to New York and is living as a wealthy shut-in, visited only by Michael and Nikols. When Michael comes to him asking for help in administering the cure (which is highly experimental and illegal and, for some reason, has to be done in international waters), Milo is able to find a cargo ship and a group of mercenaries to act as crew. Coming along for the journey is Michael’s close associate Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona). She injects Michael with the formula, and hey presto, it’s the birth of Morbius the Living Vampire. Morbius, now part man, part bat-like creature, has an insatiable hunger for human blood and drains the entire crew. Martine, having been knocked unconscious by one of the mercenaries, misses the action, and the audience can consider her the lucky one because, wow, the action is so generic and poorly realized it’s almost unbelievable that it will be the blueprint for what we see in the rest of the film. The cargo ship incident puts Morbius on the FBI’s radar. Agents Stroud (Tyrese Gibson) and Rodriguez (Al Madrigal) eventually track down Morbius at the hospital where a nurse has been exsanguinated. Morbius has been using his synthetic blood to curb his appetite, and we’ve been given enough of his tortured dilemma in clumsy voiceover to know that he’s not responsible for her death, which leaves only one other person in contention. To absolutely no one’s surprise, Milo has snuck into Morbius’ lab and taken the cure. The rest of the film essentially boils down to a fight between the regretful Morbius and the elated Milo. Matt Smith, Last Night in Soho (2021), is deeply relishing his villain persona and is the highlight of the film with his unhinged performance. A man without power suddenly has superhuman strength and can unbottle all his anger and resentment with unbridled glee. Morbius feels responsible for his friend but also has to stop him from laying waste to innocent people, and yadda, yadda, can we please get a better script? The action beats in the film are so poorly shot. In “vampire time,” we see some kind of hazy smoke effect that makes a lot of the movements blurred and muddy — to combat this, there is some lazy slow motion, so we can apparently marvel at the enhanced power of Morbius. For those who found the fight scenes in last year’s Venom: Let There Be Carnage ridiculous, the scenes in Morbius are next-level bad. Jared Leto, Suicide Squad (2016), mumbles his way through his performance. We are told repeatedly that he’s a good guy who has just made a terrible mistake. Franky, it’s very hard to care about him and his dilemma with dealing with the Hippocratic Oath he swore and his overwhelming bloodlust. His relationship with Martine is characteristically without depth, with there being no indication that Michael pre-transformation was in love with her but perhaps trying to spare her a life with his illness. The usually excellent Jared Harris, Chernobyl (2019), is barely given any screen time, which is a shame as perhaps more time with a wise mentor figure would have given both Morbius and Milo more depth. It’s so very difficult to care about any of these underwritten characters. It’s harder still when they’re given the weakest of plots (writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless clearly didn’t receive any studio notes on revisions), all for an origin story of a character who is at his core so deeply uninteresting that it’s almost impossible to be invested in whatever happens to him. Of course, since the opening of the Multiverse in Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), we are given two post-credits scenes that reintroduce us to a former Spider-Man villain. Both of these are as inert as the preceding film and do very little to excite the audience for a sequel. Morbius is a prime example of what Scorsese was trying to point out about the generic nature of superhero films. There are always some excellent films in the pool of the cape genre (see Matt Reeves’ The Batman as a recent example) but increasingly, as the IP gets stretched further and further, there is less to work with that has true cinematic value. Morbius is a thin piece that lacks any reason to entice comic book fans, genre fans, or action fans. No doubt, because of the aggressive marketing Sony has done, it will get some traction and take a bite out of the box office, but a good film it is not."
"Aug 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,I can&apos;t even comprehend how they thought this was worth putting out&#46; Worst of all&#44; it connects itself to an actual good Spider-Man villain&#46;
"Jul 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,A terribly dull movie that takes you back to the worst CBM&#8217;s in the 2000s&#46; Jared Leto brings dedication&#44; Matt Smith brings charm &amp; is having the time of his life&#8230;&#46; But god the script&#44; the editing&#44; the pacing was all terribly brought together
"Jul 25, 2023",NEGATIVE," Michael Morbius is anything but mild-mannered. He is a biochemist and Nobel Prize worthy egomaniac determined to achieve greatness no matter the cost. He is also plagued with a rare blood disease that cripples his every move, every thought, and every action. It’s this disease that ends up shaping the way Dr. Morbius sees the world and clouds his judgment when he finally discovers a cure for what ails him.  “Morbius” is the newest addition to what audiences have started calling the Sony Spider-Man Universe. It is an introduction to a character that breeds life into an antihero, much like the SSMU’s 2021 film, “Venom: Let There Be Carnage.” However, in this newest Marvel journey, we have a main character who completely lacks charisma, common sense, and ethics. We meet Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) early on in Costa Rica, where the cane-wielding protagonist cuts his hand to bleed open, attracting bats from a cave like Marvel’s version of Bruce Wayne. Yet, we quickly discover, this man is no Dark Knight. He is experimenting with new treatments in an attempt to cure his disease, as well as the blood disease of his childhood friend, Milo (Matt Smith). They have always had a pact between them: “Like the original Spartans, we are the few against the many.” This is a quote often repeated throughout the film, although it strikes many meanings towards the climax. After many failed trials, Dr. Morbius finally finds a way to cure himself, leading to side effects of vampiric proportions. During an experiment on a ship in international waters, an incident occurs that leaves several men dead and Dr. Morbius on the run. After becoming a living vampire, Morbius feeds off of synthetic blood in an effort to delay the inevitable: having to feed off of human blood for survival. His disease may be cured now, but his urge for human blood grows stronger by the minute, as he goes from barely walking to superhuman strength and powers beyond his control. He feels a kinship with bats and perfects his echolocation, otherwise known as bat radar. When he is finally detained and questioned by detectives about the ill-fated ship, Morbius exclaims, “I’m starting to get hungry, you wouldn’t like me when I’m hungry.” This is an obvious nod to Marvel’s Hulk, but it falls flat in this film.  While Morbius comes to the realization that his new existence will prove to be tumultuous in the end, Milo suddenly discovers a new lease on life by injecting the same serum to cure his disease. Angry and confused as to why Morbius would have kept this “cure” all to himself, Milo becomes his ultimate competitor in a world that would have been better off if neither of them existed. In this instance, Milo is almost literally biting the hand that feeds him. It’s not that “Morbius” is bad, but that it is SO bad that it’s almost unwatchable. Matt Smith is a waste of great talent in a role that sees him go from practically paralyzed to supervillain in a matter of seconds. You would’ve thought that Jared Leto learned his lesson from the negative reviews his Joker received from “Suicide Squad,” yet here he is again hamming it up for cameras where not even his shirtless scenes can deflect from bad writing. There is a severe lack of female performers, so much so that actress Adria Arjona playing Martine (aka Morbius’s girlfriend?) has to pick up the slack for all female representation in a big budget film that claims to be a bridge between Spider-Man and the multiverse. We have two post-credit scenes that help to build that bridge for audiences, but they have absolutely nothing to do with the 1 hour and 44 minutes of dreck that came before it.  In the end, we witness a mediocre duel between Morbius and Milo, where bats are summoned and Martine gets caught in the mix. It’s anticlimactic at best. It would have been much better if the filmmakers made a 7-minute version of the post-credit scenes, uploaded them to Disney+, and called it a day."
"Jul 25, 2023",NEGATIVE," Synopsis: Dangerously ill with a rare blood disorder and determined to save others suffering the same fate, Dr. Morbius (Jared Leto) attempts a desperate gamble. While at first it seems to be a radical success, a darkness inside him is unleashed. Will good override evil - or will Morbius succumb to his mysterious new urges? Since the pandemic started, movies have suffered numerous delays. Changing release dates constantly inevitably affects the hype surrounding each work, especially from major studios. However, while this particular moment raised more problems than solutions, it also provided film companies with a way to deal with their ""disposable flicks"". The COVID excuse to justify bad decisions by executives has been used here and there, so I find it surprising that Morbius has gone through so many delays instead of Sony just dumping it in January as usual. Unfortunately, Daniel Espinosa's (Life) movie kept moving through the calendar due to its own problems and not because of any external factor. When Jared Leto (The Little Things) is genuinely one of the few positive aspects of a film, something must have gone very, very wrong with its production. The actor is known for his extreme dedication to his roles, but his off-screen ""method acting"" generated unbelievable stories that his peers, filmmakers, and cinephiles either disapprove of or applaud. That said, despite being an admittedly controversial actor, Leto possesses immense talent and demonstrates it in this third installment of the Sony-Marvel cinematic universe - officially named Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU). Both Leto and Matt Smith (Last Night in Soho) try to carry the first half of Morbius, mainly while their characters focus on finding the cure for their rare diseases. The two actors have excellent chemistry, and their interactions before the whole uncontrolled action are interesting enough. The action itself contains pleasing visual elements created by VFX artists and cinematographer Oliver Wood (The Equalizer 2), including three sequences with more suspense and tension than anticipated. However, from the somewhat old-fashioned mix of slow-motion with a faster pace to the dreadful third act with an incomprehensible CGI blend filling the screen, it's still one of the most inconsistent components of the movie. From here, it won't be easy to find praise, with the screenplay by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (Gods of Egypt) being the biggest negative factor. A narrative heavy on cheap, unnecessary exposition with a main plot so generic that Morbius could very well have been released in 2005. There's no surprise factor in a story incredibly predictable from the first few minutes, where the lack of character development not only raises mind-boggling logical questions but also keeps viewers from empathizing with any hero, villain, or other ""bodies present"". Adria Arjona (Sweet Girl) plays the ""pretty scientist"" stereotype, Jared Harris (Allied) the cliche role of ""fake dad"", Milo (Smith) goes from being a child with nothing to a millionaire adult - who knows how and what job he has - and Michael Morbius, the alleged anti-villain with complex motivations, is, after all, developed as a head-to-toe ""good guy""... which wouldn't be a problem if the most confusing post-credits scenes of Sony-Marvel's history didn't completely contradict the preceding 104 minutes, in addition to breaking several storylines explained in previous MCU and SSU films. The credits teaser addiction is so powerful that it's already beginning to impact the movie viewers have just seen. On the technical side, Pietro Scalia's (Ambulance) editing ruins pretty much the entire film, making quite an impactful contribution to the overall mess. Scalia may not have been the only culprit, but the editing of the various narrative points and the action sequences can make a viewer dizzy due to so many sudden shifts in location and characters. Jon Ekstrand's score (Child 44) ​​should be a plus since it actually elevates some moments in Morbius. It's just a shame that it's a pretty blatant copy of the music that accompanies Batman in The Dark Knight. Marvel and Sony have a tremendous opportunity to transform Hollywood again. If cinematic universes are the popular type of franchise every studio wants these days, cinematic multiverses could be ""the next big thing"". Unfortunately, this MCU-SSU combination will be analyzed as ""the example to not be followed"". Not only has the SSU still not delivered a single movie acclaimed by both critics and audience, but the merger comes at the cost of destroying the entire narrative logic built in the last Spider-Man flicks. Morbius is yet another disaster from the Sony-Marvel shared universe. Despite good performances from Jared Leto and Matt Smith and even a couple of visually captivating action sequences, the formulaic screenplay that seems to originate from the beginning of the century ruins everything in its path. From the predictability and zero creativity of the main plot to the heavy reliance on uninteresting, unnecessary exposition, Daniel Espinosa finds his most significant problem in the blatant lack of care in the treatment of the characters. The narrative logical lapses are too many to ignore and even amplified by extremely messy editing, a third act wrapped in an unfathomable blend of CGI, and a plagiarized score. One of the most embarrassing productions by a major studio in recent years."
"Jul 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,It comes as no surprise that the extremely delayed Moribus is not the finest superhero movie ever released&#46; The film lacks depth and intrigue&#46; It&#8217;s a slow-moving exploration of a character that barely makes the case for its existence&#46;
"Jul 20, 2023",NEGATIVE," “All the less than favourable rumours circulating about Morbius made me apprehensive, to begin with. But I went into it hoping for better, and unfortunately, the movie ended up being even worse.” On the heels of Sony’s Spider-Man: Now Way Home success story, you’d think they would be able to keep the moment going with its introduction of Marvel’s favourite vampire, Dr. Michael Morbius. But unfortunately, Morbius stops that success in its track with an awkward attempt at an origin story. There’s not much that redeems the movie because its predictability renders the story too weak to carry through anything of substance. No real foreshadowing occurs in the film, as you can see the plot coming a mile away. It’s like being told a tale by a child relying on ‘and then this happened, and then this happens’ to keep the story going. We’re introduced to a pallid Dr. Morbius (Jared Leto) using crutches to keep himself upright due to an incurable blood disease. And within seconds, we hear of his obsession with vampire bats, and he cuts open his palm with a dirty knife to lure them to him. Just like that, we know what’s to come. Next, we get a flashback of young Michael (Charlie Shotwell) in a hospital/boarding school, playing chess against himself, surrounded by kids with the same condition and about to meet his soon-to-be friend. The child actors who play young Moribus and his friend Milo are the most compelling characters in the film. Especially Joseph Esson, who plays young Milo, manages to deliver more emotion and depth in a couple of mins than the adults in Morbius. That lack of depth is primarily due to the aggressively fast pacing of the story, which leaves you little time to become invested in the characters or their plights. The in-story timeline of the movie’s events is a week that simultaneously feels like too much time and not enough since so much is happening to the characters. Still, they seem to take everything in stride and process it all immediately. In the trailer, we learned about the ship full of bodies that wash ashore. The police’s immediate conclusion that it must’ve been a vampire comes off as comedic and ridiculous. Milo (Matt Smith), upon coming face to face with a blood starved Michael, immediately leaps to embrace his friend. Even after having just watched him down a pint of blood. Despite being chased by allegations of murder, people seem indifferent, cracking holy water and Dracula jokes as if they aren’t fighting against a ticking clock counting down to a disastrous end.  And speaking of disastrous ends, the final boss battle severely underwhelms. MattSmith’s Milo as an antagonist lacks any gravitas or villainous presence; he comes off more as petulant and inconsistent. The excessive use of CGI to show off Morbius’ powers and affinity for bats also obscure what could’ve been phenomenal stunt work making the combat even less impactful. All the less than favourable rumours circulating about Morbius made me apprehensive about attending the press screening, to begin with. But I went into it hoping for better. Unfortunately, the movie ended up being even worse than the rumours led me to believe. The saving grace is that both end credit scenes happen almost immediately after the movie ends, so you can leave immediately."
"Jul 16, 2023",NEGATIVE," If Morbius is remembered at all, it will be as the movie that flopped twice. Released on April Fool’s Day 2022, it grossed only $167m against a budget of $83m. For a superhero tentpole movie, this is a disaster. This happened for many reasons. The most obvious is that Morbius The Living Vampire isn’t exactly a household name. The character is a second or third tier Spider-Man villain that has never appeared in live action before. As much as the marketing tried to tie Morbius into the MCU with trailers featuring a poster of Spider-Man in the back of one scene and the appearance of Michael Keaton‘s Vulture, he was still an unknown quantity.Another reason is superhero fatigue. Writing this in July 2023, there have been more superhero movies flopping than succeeding recently especially outside of the MCU. DC wiping it’s slate and having to release a bunch of movies that have no bearing on the future of the cinematic universe is always going to hurt but the MCU is also feeling the burn with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania struggling to break even.Finally, Jared Leto. His last foray into comic book movies was as the incredibly disliked Joker in one of the worst superhero movies of recent years: Suicide Squad. And in my personal opinion, the guy isn’t a great actor and allegedly not a great human being either. With all that going for it, it was not shocking the movie got critically eviscerated and made no money.source: Sony Pictures EntertainmentBut then, the internet decided that Morbius would become the meme de jour with the joke being that actually people were excited about the movie and that it was a masterpiece. The enduring joke that has passed onto pretty much every subsequent movie is that the best part of the movie is when Morbius says, “It’s Morbin’ time.” Now I haven’t seen this movie yet, but I have a sneaking suspicion that it won’t happen.When the trailer for the similarly doomed Kraven the Hunter came out, the top comment was to the effect of “I can’t wait until he says it’s Kravin’ time!” The internet is bad for many things, but stupid jokes that somehow get funnier with age is not one of them.Unfortunately for Morbius, Sony execs assumed that this meme situation meant that Morbius was developing a cult following so they released in cinemas thinking they could recoup some cash now that there was a fervent fanbase – but they were incredibly wrong and the movie earned $300,000.So now, two flops in, let’s see how Morbius stands up away from the hype.MorbiusIt’s fascinating to watch a movie that doesn’t contain a single original idea. Nothing here is new or clever. It is just a string of tropes and scenes from other movies cobbled together into a stick-thin plot that we’ve seen dozens of times before in other superior origin story movies. It all feels perfunctory, like a chore that needs to be done before they can make sequels with the character established. It’s lazy in a way that is almost offensive to the viewer’s intelligence and wallet when they trot out scene after scene of stuff we’ve seen before like:   The cops were one is serious, the other is goofy. The mentor/father figure character is played by a distinguished character actor. The sick child that is apparently the doctor’s only patient. A sickly weak character suddenly becoming ripped after gaining powers. A vampire who has to fight the urge to drink blood. Blood dripping on someone’s hand so they look up and get killed. “I’m hungry, you don’t wanna see me when I’m hungry”. A Keyser Soze-esque handicapped walk into a fully ambulant one. A scene in a bar where a loudmouth gets his comeuppance. A vampire perched on the edge of a building like a gargoyle. A character gets a superficial cut that bleeds enough to cause a vampire to nearly frenzy until they get their hunger under control, etc. etc. On and on it goes with not a single moment where a viewer might be shocked, challenged, or impressed.source: Sony Pictures EntertainmentThe movie only comes to life when Matt Smith is there. He’s having fun and mixing it up whereas Jared Leto is so utterly serious and humorless that you never feel attached to his character. When Smith‘s character, Milo, gains vampire powers the scenes between him and Leto really showcase the difference between an actor trying to capital A act and a performer having a blast making a superhero movie. Don’t get me wrong, you can do both. The superhero genre is full of thespians who treat the goofy material seriously but they do it with a glint in their eye. Leto treats the lighter material like he’s reading a eulogy or he’s an alien who has only read about humour in books. Consider Christian Bale in the Dark Knight trilogy. He is the straight man against the fantastical villains but never comes across as boring or bored. He can brood and deliver a one liner with equal skill.There’s none of that here. The material doesn’t help and performers like Jared Harris and Adria Arjona (excellent as Bix in Andor) struggle and fail to rise above their thankless mentor and love interest roles respectively. There is no nuance and no gray with any characters. They could replace character’s names with Cop 1, Mentor, Thug, Cop 2, and it would make no difference as each one is an archetype and not a person.And obviously the ending is a big CGI fight scene that culminates in the arrival of bats Batman Begins did better. ConclusionThe more we see shared cinematic universes fail, the more inclined I am to believe that the massive success of the MCU was a huge fluke. The Dark Universe, DCEU, and Sony’s Spider-Man Universe have all failed to match up the Marvel movies with the Dark Universe not even surviving its first outing. 2008’s Iron Man was not billed as the beginning of anything. It was Marvel’s first foray as a studio and the Nick Fury post-credit scene was very much added as a fun idea rather than a mission statement. By starting slow and building they have been able to take over the cinematic landscape, leaving other shared universes struggling to replicate their success.What these other universes seemingly don’t have is an X factor that in 2007 was probably seen more as a hindrance than the foundation of a multi-billion dollar industry that would eclipse all other genres: Robert Downey Jr. Iron Man made Downey Jr a bigger movie star than he had ever been before and gave the MCU a character fans loved and who could deliver that serious stuff alongside quips and derring-do. He managed to sell the world on Iron Man, a character who a lot of people thought was a robot because outside of the comics, no one knew who he was. And, to digress slightly, his death in Endgame has robbed the MCU of a lot of its spark that it is struggling to regain as no other character has quite connected with audiences the way his Tony Stark did. source: Sony Pictures EntertainmentSo what does this have to do with Morbius? Well, Morbius was a double failure at the box office because its lead is boring, its plot is derivative, and its marketing tried its damnedest to trick audiences into thinking they needed to watch the movie or fall behind on their Marvel movies, which wasn’t the case at all. Leto’s woodenness is amazing to me considering he is an actor known for being a bit out there. His Joker, Paolo Gucci, and Niander Wallace are all interesting and challenging in different ways for good or ill, but his Morbius is just nothing. I can’t see why Arjona’s character would want to spend more than five minutes with him, let alone be his love interest. This boring-ass performance is thrown into a stark spotlight when compared to Matt Smith who is letting loose and having a ball. He is given nothing particularly mind-blowing to work with but he finds a way to make it compelling to watch. Compare Leto’s discovery of his powers/newfound health is all expressionless brooding to Smith’s dancing around shirtless in a pair of knackered trainers, preening his new body and loving every second of it. In the end, there’s a reason why Gen Z decided that the funniest thing they could say about it was that it was good, with their almost supernatural grasp of irony they can see that of all the things this movie is, good is not even remotely one of them.Watch MorbiousPowered by JustWatch Does content like this matter to you?Become a Member and support film journalism.

It all feels perfunctory, like a chore that needs to be done before they can make sequels with the character established. It’s lazy in a way that is almost offensive to the viewer’s intelligence and wallet when they trot out scene after scene of stuff we’ve seen before like:   The cops were one is serious, the other is goofy. The mentor/father figure character is played by a distinguished character actor. The sick child that is apparently the doctor’s only patient. A sickly weak character suddenly becoming ripped after gaining powers. A vampire who has to fight the urge to drink blood. Blood dripping on someone’s hand so they look up and get killed. “I’m hungry, you don’t wanna see me when I’m hungry”. A Keyser Soze-esque handicapped walk into a fully ambulant one. A scene in a bar where a loudmouth gets his comeuppance. A vampire perched on the edge of a building like a gargoyle. A character gets a superficial cut that bleeds enough to cause a vampire to nearly frenzy until they get their hunger under control, etc. etc. On and on it goes with not a single moment where a viewer might be shocked, challenged, or impressed.source: Sony Pictures EntertainmentThe movie only comes to life when Matt Smith is there. He’s having fun and mixing it up whereas Jared Leto is so utterly serious and humorless that you never feel attached to his character. When Smith‘s character, Milo, gains vampire powers the scenes between him and Leto really showcase the difference between an actor trying to capital A act and a performer having a blast making a superhero movie. Don’t get me wrong, you can do both. The superhero genre is full of thespians who treat the goofy material seriously but they do it with a glint in their eye. Leto treats the lighter material like he’s reading a eulogy or he’s an alien who has only read about humour in books. Consider Christian Bale in the Dark Knight trilogy. He is the straight man against the fantastical villains but never comes across as boring or bored. He can brood and deliver a one liner with equal skill.There’s none of that here. The material doesn’t help and performers like Jared Harris and Adria Arjona (excellent as Bix in Andor) struggle and fail to rise above their thankless mentor and love interest roles respectively. There is no nuance and no gray with any characters. They could replace character’s names with Cop 1, Mentor, Thug, Cop 2, and it would make no difference as each one is an archetype and not a person.And obviously the ending is a big CGI fight scene that culminates in the arrival of bats Batman Begins did better. ConclusionThe more we see shared cinematic universes fail, the more inclined I am to believe that the massive success of the MCU was a huge fluke. The Dark Universe, DCEU, and Sony’s Spider-Man Universe have all failed to match up the Marvel movies with the Dark Universe not even surviving its first outing. 2008’s Iron Man was not billed as the beginning of anything. It was Marvel’s first foray as a studio and the Nick Fury post-credit scene was very much added as a fun idea rather than a mission statement. By starting slow and building they have been able to take over the cinematic landscape, leaving other shared universes struggling to replicate their success.What these other universes seemingly don’t have is an X factor that in 2007 was probably seen more as a hindrance than the foundation of a multi-billion dollar industry that would eclipse all other genres: Robert Downey Jr. Iron Man made Downey Jr a bigger movie star than he had ever been before and gave the MCU a character fans loved and who could deliver that serious stuff alongside quips and derring-do. He managed to sell the world on Iron Man, a character who a lot of people thought was a robot because outside of the comics, no one knew who he was. And, to digress slightly, his death in Endgame has robbed the MCU of a lot of its spark that it is struggling to regain as no other character has quite connected with audiences the way his Tony Stark did. source: Sony Pictures EntertainmentSo what does this have to do with Morbius? Well, Morbius was a double failure at the box office because its lead is boring, its plot is derivative, and its marketing tried its damnedest to trick audiences into thinking they needed to watch the movie or fall behind on their Marvel movies, which wasn’t the case at all. Leto’s woodenness is amazing to me considering he is an actor known for being a bit out there. His Joker, Paolo Gucci, and Niander Wallace are all interesting and challenging in different ways for good or ill, but his Morbius is just nothing. I can’t see why Arjona’s character would want to spend more than five minutes with him, let alone be his love interest. This boring-ass performance is thrown into a stark spotlight when compared to Matt Smith who is letting loose and having a ball. He is given nothing particularly mind-blowing to work with but he finds a way to make it compelling to watch. Compare Leto’s discovery of his powers/newfound health is all expressionless brooding to Smith’s dancing around shirtless in a pair of knackered trainers, preening his new body and loving every second of it. In the end, there’s a reason why Gen Z decided that the funniest thing they could say about it was that it was good, with their almost supernatural grasp of irony they can see that of all the things this movie is, good is not even remotely one of them.Watch MorbiousPowered by JustWatch Does content like this matter to you?Become a Member and support film journalism.

The enduring joke that has passed onto pretty much every subsequent movie is that the best part of the movie is when Morbius says, “It’s Morbin’ time.” Now I haven’t seen this movie yet, but I have a sneaking suspicion that it won’t happen.When the trailer for the similarly doomed Kraven the Hunter came out, the top comment was to the effect of “I can’t wait until he says it’s Kravin’ time!” The internet is bad for many things, but stupid jokes that somehow get funnier with age is not one of them.Unfortunately for Morbius, Sony execs assumed that this meme situation meant that Morbius was developing a cult following so they released in cinemas thinking they could recoup some cash now that there was a fervent fanbase – but they were incredibly wrong and the movie earned $300,000.So now, two flops in, let’s see how Morbius stands up away from the hype.MorbiusIt’s fascinating to watch a movie that doesn’t contain a single original idea.

The movie only comes to life when Matt Smith is there. He’s having fun and mixing it up whereas Jared Leto is so utterly serious and humorless that you never feel attached to his character. When Smith‘s character, Milo, gains vampire powers the scenes between him and Leto really showcase the difference between an actor trying to capital A act and a performer having a blast making a superhero movie. Don’t get me wrong, you can do both. The superhero genre is full of thespians who treat the goofy material seriously but they do it with a glint in their eye. Leto treats the lighter material like he’s reading a eulogy or he’s an alien who has only read about humour in books. Consider Christian Bale in the Dark Knight trilogy. He is the straight man against the fantastical villains but never comes across as boring or bored. He can brood and deliver a one liner with equal skill.There’s none of that here. The material doesn’t help and performers like Jared Harris and Adria Arjona (excellent as Bix in Andor) struggle and fail to rise above their thankless mentor and love interest roles respectively. There is no nuance and no gray with any characters. They could replace character’s names with Cop 1, Mentor, Thug, Cop 2, and it would make no difference as each one is an archetype and not a person.And obviously the ending is a big CGI fight scene that culminates in the arrival of bats Batman Begins did better. ConclusionThe more we see shared cinematic universes fail, the more inclined I am to believe that the massive success of the MCU was a huge fluke.

"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE," The attempt to mend the severed disconnects between the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the select characters possessed by Sony Pictures' rights only results in a deeper divide following the long-delayed Morbius. The film follows famed blood disease Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) as he continues to engineer life-saving blood alternatives. His work goes awry, and consequentially, Morbius becomes a superhuman with vampiric abilities.  There are plenty of opportunities for Morbius to elevate the originality of its comic book inspiration and defeat the constant formula that has become synonymous with Marvel-branded works across film and television.  The creative team ultimately avoids any means of taking creative liberty while crafting a significantly anti-climactic addition to the cinematic canon of Marvel Studios. The rushed, lackluster backstory vaguely contributes to why Morbius's attempt to keep lifelong friend Milo (Matt Smith) under control fizzles out as forgettable as the film treks on. Seldom is there a moment where character interactions seem performed with the intention to have any meaningful purpose behind them. The dialogue is stiff, stale, and robotic as the tone tries all too hard to come across as grey and brooding. The self-assurance that Morbius could have once been a horror movie is abandoned as genre tropes are overlooked. There is an evident shortcoming of the structure that distracts away from what the film's true intentions are. Morbius excuses substance for questionable action and miserably-edited CGI. The film becomes confused by itself and fails to gain the ability to redirect itself after becoming unforgivingly derailed. No amount of special effects has the power to scrape up saving grace from the scraps of the film. A distinct lack of atmosphere strips away the film's ability to not only earn attention but to keep it captive. There is no striking nor impressionable resonance that is attached to Morbius that makes it truly forgettable. The exclusion of any energy allows the film to exhaust itself before it can fully collapse beneath the weight of poor craftsmanship. The total self-resignment of even attempting to stay engaged with what it could offer is sacrificed to dull storytelling surrounding even more uninspired characters. "

"Dec 28, 2022",NEGATIVE," Courtesy Sony PicturesMorbius is neither as dire as you have heard nor is it incredibly good. It’s mid-tier Marvel, not particularly inspired but not the worst thing I’ve ever sat through. If anything, it kind of reminds me of the Underworld series. They are both films that look good, but lack substance. Michael Morbius is a child with a rare genetic blood disease with no hope for either a cure or a long life and a brilliant mind. He meets a friend in a home for children with the disease and saves his life which puts him on the path to become a doctor. When Morbius finally creates an experimental treatment that could work, he uses himself as a test subject and to his horror becomes a living vampire. He is now powerful beyond his dreams, but afflicted with a new disease. Can he cure himself again or prevent himself from feeding on and killing humans? The film stars Jared Leto (Suicide Squad, Blade Runner 2049), Matt Smith (“Doctor Who”, “The Crown”), Adria Arjona (“Good Omens“, 6 Underground), Jared Harris (“Chernobyl”, “Carnival Row“), Al Madrigal (“I’m Dying Up Here”, “About a Boy”), with Tyrese Gibson (Black and Blue, The Fast and Furious franchise). It’s directed by Daniel Espinosa (Snabba Cash, Life) and written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless who have worked together on screenplays before for films like The Last Witch Hunter, Dracula Untold, and Gods Of Egypt. The cinematography, which is very good, is by Oliver Wood who lensed all three of the Jason Bourne films that Paul Greengrass directed, Bill And Ted’s Bogus Journey, Face/Off, and for the real horror heads, Neon Maniacs. The score by Jon Ekstrand is good. It soars more often than the film does. The cinematography is part of why I say that MORBIUS reminds me of Underworld. Underworld was a very glossy vampires versus werewolves movie where Kate Beckinsale moped around photogenically in bondage wear and did a lot of slow-mo running while firing two guns. There was a whole number about tragic love between vampires and werewolves, but there was never really any kind of emotional connection to said tragic love story. The leads, Beckinsale and Scott Speedman, had zero chemistry and you couldn’t empathize with their characters because both actors either lacked the skill to connect with the audience on an emotional level or simply didn’t bother because it was a movie about vampire-werewolf love. MORBIUS has a one-up on Underworld because there are some interesting characters and actors who do good work. Matt Smith as Loxias/Milo is really going for the gusto. I had more empathy for him as a character and I really felt that he would have made a better and more complex Morbius. When he’s angry? He’s angry. Smith allowed himself to be vulnerable and evil and it’s all believable. That’s what Michael Morbius is as a character. He is a brilliant mind who has a desire to save people but is still kind of arrogant and is careless in that arrogance. That’s the characterization in the film’s story. It’s just that Matt Smith is better at it. I can’t say that this does harm to the film. Smith’s performance is one of the best things about it. Jared Harris is good as always in a smaller but important role. He doesn’t have much to do, but when he’s onscreen he’s committed to it. Adria Arjona is a cut above most Marvel girlfriends, although the script makes her a Marvel girlfriend anyway eventually. She’s interesting but doesn’t overplay the fact that her character is interested in Morbius or that she’s the only one who will call him on his bullshit. Arjona gives her an internal life. Al Madrigal is quite good as Agent Rodriguez and part of the cop comic relief. He has a good touch with the comedy and also doesn’t overplay it. His character also has internal life and personal magnetism. Tyrese Gibson is Tyrese Gibson. When the camera is close up on his face, you can see his “I’m over it” thoughts. It’s a version of Danny Glover’s classic “I’m too old for this shit.” but without the catchphrase. It works well for a New York policeman and veteran who really doesn’t have time for vampire nonsense. Jared Leto. Oh, Jared Leto. Doctor Michael Morbius’ character template is similar to that of the late Tony Stark. Genius with a thorny exterior that hides a caring heart. The problem is that while I can fully believe the casual arrogance in Leto’s performance, I don’t get that he has a caring heart. The character pulls some stunts that could get people killed by the logic of the film’s story and doesn’t blink an eye or try to warn people. He’s too enraptured with his own self and brilliance to say, “Hey, guys, maybe take cover before I unleash some killer bats.” which is an interesting idea. A Marvel antihero who really is kind of a jerk and fully unrepentant about it. The struggle between the pseudo vampire killing urge and Morbius’ emerging humanity. If that’s what the screenwriters and the director intended, none of that plays in Leto’s performance. I realize that people are yelling about the film being terrible because of other reasons, probably related to the script. I’m here to say that I place the blame for this on Leto’s performance. It’s not enough of anything. For an actor who claims method and makes a big deal of staying in character, I don’t really see the character of Morbius onscreen or feel that commitment to the character. There’s no emotional connection or internal life so I can’t feel empathy for the central character. He seems more interested in showing off his vampire pecs, yes, there is a scene where once Morbius transforms, he just has to take his shirt off. I heard some snickers behind me in the theatre at a couple of points, but Morbius taking his shirt off so that we can see the vamp pecs would have been the moment when I laughed out loud had I not been in critical observational mode. Once again, Leto, among other actors, particularly among the House of Gucci cast, claims to be working so hard that they “become the character” in their films, there’s very little here that supports that claim of method commitment. If you are going to claim that kind of commitment, you don’t get to drop it when you’re making the Marvel Pseudo Vampire movie. Also, I have said that it is impossible for an actor to “become the character” and that this type of behavior is grandstanding that has no relation to the Method as defined by Konstantin Sergeyevich Stanislavski. I can’t fault the direction by Daniel Espinosa either. Other parts of the film work just fine, so that’s to his credit. MORBIUS is a mid-tier Marvel movie that is hampered by the lackluster central performance. The supporting cast is good as are the cinematography and score. It makes me wish that Matt Smith had been cast as Morbius honestly. The script isn’t that much better or worse than a lot of Marvel films but it does suffer from a slight case of Chekov’s Bats."
"Oct 21, 2022",NEGATIVE," George Clooney and Julia Roberts powering a romcom like this is like getting an entire power plant to light a Christmas yard display. The elevation of the material here is palpable because those two just ooze charisma. You add Kaitlyn Dever and Billie Lourd, a great location, an able director with a feel for romance and timing, and a script that’s just funny and introspective enough to withstand its shortcomings … you get a heck of a time. This is so easy. Hollywood should be embarrassed it’s let these movies slide into a streaming wasteland. I’m guessing they’ll figure out sooner than later why these movies need to come back. It’s an easy movie to like. Mia Goth is on one in this. Like … she’s going for it. This, at least to me, has a much better through-line than X did. It tells a better, scarier story about how hurt people … hurt people, and about how chasing fame is a cancerous pursuit fueled by the worst tendencies inside of us. Ti West really seems emotionally driven by this grander story, as he’s trying to say something poignant about the industry while also using strong horror tropes to satisfy genre fans. At least to me, X felt a little too straightforward, if very well done for what it is. Pearl feels like the riskier endeavor. It’s not really a classical horror film, as much as it is an incredibly dark character study with horror seeping through. It’s all on Goth to keep it from ever getting too comfortable, and she is sensational. Her big monologue and the final scene in the film are just so different, one almost begging you to feel sympathy for a psychopath, the other refusing to let you leave with anything than a pit in your stomach. That’s the best closing shot of the year, at least to me. It’s one that shows you the depths Goth goes to plunge this character into darkness. It’s terrifying. West just lathers it on, too, the way he makes you sit in the moment and uses the music to make you feel like it’ll never end. It’s a test of endurance, in how long you can stare at the screen without crawling out of your skin. It’s like trying to run away from a monster in a room with no doors. It’s almost sucking you in. That’s good horror right there, unforgettable imagery laced in theme that’ll show up in your technicolor nightmares. This was pretty great. Like that last shot, it’s going to linger. How could it not? Not really familiar with much of Lena Dunham’s work outside of reputation, and I know she’s got her detractors, but I found this to be a very spirited affair. A really clever spin on the coming-of-age comedy with a whip-smart script that feels pretty discerning with how to play into its timeframe while also making relevant, useful commentary. Actually pretty damn funny, too. Bella Ramsey is going to take off once that Last of Us show comes on; she’s stellar here. Enjoyed this! Kind of a B-movie riff on Annihilation, which is funny since Paramount also did that. Maika Monroe is already an elite Scream Queen, and Jake Lacy is born to play a part like this. The twist is better because of what they do with it, not just that they try to pull it off in general. It seemed kind of done before until you understood exactly what they were going to do with it. Be patient with this one. It takes some time to really gel, but the third act really makes some bold decisions. It’s way more what I thought the guys that made Villains would do in a movie like this. I dug it! Tár feels much less “cancel culture movie,” so much more a parable told with a battering ram and a bullhorn. It’s Macbeth meets Amadeus meets Steve Jobs meets your Twitter feed. A dense, electric entrapment of ideas and crescendos. Blanchett’s best? One of my favorite aspects of this film is how it founds itself on literary themes about the rise and fall of power to show how our culture of accountability has strong roots in our stories and history. Ain’t nothing new about the corrosion of absolute power. Happens faster now. There’s also such a fine walk between buzzy cultural debates about “cancelling” and the real terror of those in power abusing their standing without regard to their actions. This film does as well a job of dicing up the nuances to both and the pratfalls of semantics as I’ve seen. It’s hard to remember the last time we got a franchise movie like this that threw fan expectation to the wind this aggressively. I didn’t care for Halloween Kills, but I at least respect what it was trying to do. Here, I think David Gordon Green swings in the exact opposite direction, to make Haddonfield a different kind of villain than it was in Kills, and it just works so well. Putting the movie on a relative unknown’s shoulders (Rohan Campbell) and having him carry most of the movie’s water was just a bold ass decision, but I liked it a lot. He’s got some Skeet Ulrich vibes going on, with some Paul Dano and James Franco in there, too. A very dangerous, beguiling, sympathetic actor, which worked to build up such a tragic character into something more … well, you’ll get it. I’d love to see this guy get more work to do. He’s got a spark. JLC does just enough to justify Strode’s story continuing, and I’m glad they stamp it here rather than leave things dangling. Halloween sure as hell ends, and it’s quite a finish. Not for everyone, some people will hate this. It betrays the bombastic, Michael-filled finale people probably wanted, the 2-hour marquee melee, to tell a very Halloween-esque story about how communities create monsters, and how monsters create communities. It’s a tantalizing, uncompromising finale, completely unnecessary (like all of these movies) but also energetic, nasty and 80s Lost Boys/90s Scream-ass moody and fun in the way it breaks down its own Shape and color. Kinda loved it, warts and all. It’s my favorite of the DGG trilogy. Wish the script were a little cleaner, but the big swing means some grass kicked up on the green. Clearly nothing will top the original Halloween, but all the respect in the world for DGG and Danny McBride letting this be the note the franchise goes out on (at least for now until the inevitable reboot happens). Like all Apatow-produced films, this could’ve been 100 minutes, but it’s hard to want to nitpick such a sweet romcom that is also grappling with its own history so honestly as this one does. Very funny, Luke Macfarlane is fantastic, Billy Eichner can root a cast. Takes a little time to really get going, but once it does, it’s one of the better comedies of the year. Nic Stoller can make these movies in his sleep. The Dear Evan Hansen joke was aces. Now someone give Bowen Yang a movie. I hope Rob Zombie gets to do a Netflix series with this because you can tell how much fun he’s having. It’s very relaxed, corny and heartfelt. No stakes can almost make it … too relaxed … to really build any momentum, but for an extended pilot for a TV reboot, it’s hard to be that disappointed since this is recreating, y’know, The Munsters. This is probably best-case scenario for The Munsters in 2022. It’s cute! I dunno. It’s not bad. It’s not really the disaster it’s made out to be, more a corporate IP dump that’s written by a computer and features supporting actors who are showing up to cash those checks. Michael Keaton probably got a nice car for doing … like what a day or two worth of work? Also who had the idea to cast Jared Harris in this? He’s way too talented to play “the doctor who is older than Morbius.” I don’t think Jared Leto is a good actor when he is being this serious, and he proves that here. At least his Joker, as cringey as it is, made character decisions. This is just kind of dry ice. Eddie Munster looking ass. Daniel Espinosa seems to have kind of disavowed this movie, or at least hinted what’s here isn’t what he was trying to do, and I can empathize with the idea a better movie is in here … somewhere. You recast Leto, make this R and lean in on the campiness like Venom did, and you might have something workable. As it is, it’s Marvel streaming content, perfectly housed now on Netflix to be passively consumed by people who are on their phones. It’s a throwback in form, but not in personality. There’s nothing weird or dated about this movie; it’s just filling a superhero quota. The second half of this is way too far a stretch in so many wrong directions, in trying to galaxy brain the connection to people being unnecessarily pissed about Barney to #TheTimes, and in trying to lurch into the true crime space to highlight what seems to be a deeply sad period in the Barney creator’s son’s life. It just feels weird and unnecessary to spend so much time on it. This is hard from the Discovery/Netflix school of documentary style, cheaply made but just interesting enough to keep your attention. I think there’s a captivating story here about the creation of a cultural behemoth and the bizarre backlash it garnered. At times, you see the sparks of a better piece of work showing through, but after an hour, it just starts to feel like a waste of time. Once they step the stage, they fail to really live up to the thesis, which could be a hell of a study in the right hands. Don’t love it, don’t hate it. It’s just there. Entertaining until it runs out of gas. Also, letting the “Jihad for Barney” guy off the hook like that is bush league. Like, c’mon, press that guy a little harder for being such a self-pronounced jackass. Sheesh. This is like Iceland’s Gone Baby Gone. A, forgive the pun, chilling procedural about generational sin. It’ll make you want to lock your door, get under a nice blanket with a cup of cocoa and shut the world out. Ain’t a friendly place sometimes. Maybe the best film I’ve seen from Kormákur. One of those lovely “old buddy” comedies where two elderly people just go hang out and reminisce on life in lovely vistas. Just having been to Iceland, it was fun to see places I’d seen in real life. This is as easygoing as can be, but my gosh, that Southern doctor is a old school horndog. Chill out, my guy. This is really good, though. I really hope that old doctor goes to therapy. A stirring story of survival, told without a lot of frill or overdone drama. It’s just a good movie about the sheer strength of the human spirit when pressed to its absolute limits. Ólafur Darri Ólafsson is spectacular in such a difficult performance, one that purely relies on body language to show the depths of pain this guy went through to survive. He’s still actually alive in real life, too! Just an amazing story. It shows the resolve of the people of Iceland to withstand … anything and everything. A bleak (bleet?) film about the inescapable bond family members have, as badly as you know neither of them want to have it. Icelandic film doesn’t have to go this hard. This is like Yorgos Lanthimos more grounded in reality, or Todd Solondz with a big, bushy white beard. In the end, though, it’s about legacy, and how even your least favorite family member will still go to bat for you because, damn it, blood is blood. Aside from some of the churlish material, this has to be one of Sandler’s best from his original run. He’s actually committed to a vision here, and the story actually tries to find the poignancy in its premise rather than just the humor. Sandler and Drew Barrymore have undeniable chemistry, and the film makes pretty great use of its supporting cast (maybe recast Rob Schneider). None of these movies have completely stood the test of time, but this is a much better studio romcom than what we got then and what we get now. It’s a shame someone can’t figure out how to do more movies like this. Shave off some of the stupider moments, and you’d actually have a really damn good romcom here. Though I think I’m so generally apologetic with Sandler’s original run that I’d actually call this a really damn good romcom. Some of the Tom and Jerry stuff goes a hair too long, but it’s a small gripe compared to the artistry and storytelling on display here. A powerhouse."
"Aug 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,"  You never know which movie will attract the derisive affection of the internet meme lords. Take Morbius, an unadventurous and dull movie based on a character in Marvel comics. Since Sony owns Morbius, this isn’t considered an MCU movie like, say, Dr. Strange or Thor; it belongs to the same universe that spawned Venom, and at one point our troubled hero, Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto), jokingly identifies himself as such. Anyway, the internet hates Leto and hates lazy-looking wannabe franchises like Morbius, so the movie became a target for ironic social-media memes. Apparently someone at Sony noticed that Morbius was being talked about, albeit with a gibe and a sneer, and decided to re-release the film, hoping for gobs of those ironic ticket sales. It didn’t get them — its re-release take was substantially less than the cost of a small house — and it shuffled morosely off to DVD shortly thereafter.  What we find here, after all that, is a not-bad, not-good, not-much-of-anything time-waster in which Jared Leto, against all odds, does not make me want to throttle him. He’s swift and mordant as Dr. Morbius, who has a rare blood disease and develops a formula that turns him into a “living vampire.” Morbius so happens to have invented artificial blood, which he can drink in lieu of real human blood, but its effects don’t last long and soon he’s swooping around New York City as a swirling purple cloud. Just like a bat does. See, the formula comes from bat DNA, and … ah, hell, nobody ever went to these movies for scientific rigor. And when Morbius’ similarly afflicted old friend Milo (Matt Smith) takes the serum, he becomes a monster who doesn’t care at all if he has to kill to survive.   The problem here isn’t the acting; although Milo is given the sort of boilerplate villain dialogue you can instinctively recite along with him, Matt Smith commits to it, and so do Adria Arjona as Morbius’ lab associate and Jared Harris as the doctor who’s been trying to treat Morbius and Milo since they were kids. Harris’ clinic for this rare blood disease, by the way, is in Greece. I wondered why Greece, since it isn’t really a plot point, and in any case the Greece scenes were shot in England, like the rest of the movie. Wondering about this probably distracted me from the plot intricacies, but the key template here is the Marvel-comic one where someone good becomes powerful and has to stop someone bad who becomes powerful. Now and then the film makes gestures towards meaning when Morbius agonizes over the violent mercenaries he had to kill and swears never to do it again. This seems sort of wan and beside the point when the Deadpool movies, for instance, have its hero slaughtering willy-nilly, and nobody ever seriously pretended Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine never used those sharp pigstickers of his lethally.  Milo seems to have been made a killer solely so that Morbius can be blamed for it by two ineffectual cops. Prior to gaining his powers, Milo doesn’t seem the type to flip over into the ultimate evil, but he flips, all right, with no moral shading or regret. Milo is supposed to represent the untrammeled nastiness Morbius could sink to if he doesn’t watch out. I would’ve cut out the middle man and made Morbius himself the shadow that haunts him; why else turn a vampire into a superhero? Morbius has a poor chance of getting a sequel, even though they try to set one up with the reveal of a freshly vampirized character with whom Morbius will duke it out in Morbius 2: Electric Morbaloo. Again, the movie is only bland and unpersuasive, and would have disappeared without a trace if not for the jolly internet memes that snarkily celebrated it, as though it were a lovably inept thing to be cherished, not chastised, for its flaws. "
"Aug 16, 2022",NEUTRAL," I still haven’t fully figured out how Sony’s Spider-Man Universe connects with the broader Marvel Cinematic Universe. Some parts seem more connected than others while other parts don’t seem connected at all. Oh well. To be honest, I’ve lost interest in trying to figure it all out. In a nutshell both universes are (somehow) related and “Morbius” and the most recent installment.  Unfortunately, it’s not a particularly good installment. It’s not terrible either. Certainly not as bad as Sony’s last effort (“Venom: Let There Be Carnage”). But it’s hardly a movie you’ll be rushing out to see again. “Morbius” always seemed like an unusual and risky choice. And from the very start, it never felt like the studio was all that certain on how to approach the movie and on when to release it. Granted, COVID-19 played a big part in some of its delays. Still, there was a hesitancy from Sony that was hard to miss especially in their promotion of the film. And even the earliest trailers seem desperate, name-dropping Venom and revealing Michael Keaton’s Vulture just to grab the attention of the lucrative superhero genre’s fan base. It feels like “Morbius” has been about to come out for years. One of the great blessings about its release is that I’ll no longer have to sit through its trailers which found their way in front of every single movie I would see at the theater (I could almost recite them word for word). And while my interest in the movie had waned, I still held out hope regardless of the lashing it took during early screenings (much of it from the Marvel Studios faithful). “Morbius” is directed by Daniel Espinosa and despite the mixed reactions, I enjoyed his last three movies (“Safe House”, “Child 44”, and “Life”). This is a much different venture for Espinosa and it shows. At times his movie plays great and sports its own unique style which really comes out in some of the action scenes. But there are just as many moments that feel disjointed, rushed, or uninspired. The result is a mixed bag.  Jared Leto is a nice fit playing Dr. Michael Morbius who suffers from a rare debilitating blood disease he has had since birth. Gifted since childhood, Michael gained notoriety in the medical science world for developing a life-saving synthetic blood. Since then he has used his talents to try and find a cure for his disease. Helping him is his scientist partner and (potential) love interest Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona). And funding his work is his wealthy friend and surrogate brother Milo (Matt Smith) who happens to share the same illness. Strangely, Michael’s serum seemingly comes out of the blue. All we really know is that it involves vampire bats from Costa Rica and the mixing of bat DNA with human DNA. As Michael explains to Milo, it’s “highly experimental, morally questionable and very expensive”. When a sickly and desperate Michael injects himself with the serum, he does indeed cure his disease. But he also gains superhero strength, sonar-like sensitivity, and a rather disturbing appetite for human blood.  In one sense it’s tempting to praise the movie for cutting through the scientific mumbo-jumbo associated with Michael’s work. There are a couple of scenes where he’s recording medical logs explaining his symptoms. But for the most part Espinosa and screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless mercifully skip past that stuff. On the other hand, it’s such a weird and wild approach to medicine yet we get nothing to form the basis of his experiments. A guy turns himself into a living vampire and we’re just supposed to go with it. Of course every superhero story needs a villain and here it comes in the form of Milo. Frightened by what he has become, Michael tries to protect Milo by refusing to give him the serum. But Milo gets his hand on a vial and injects himself. While Michael sees his vampire condition as a curse, Milo fully embraces it which pits the close friends against each other. Like most of the characters, Milo lacks some needed depth. Matt Smith’s performance is solid even though the script pulls him in some weird directions. Sadly, the bond between Milo and Michael (which should have added emotional weight to their conflict) barely gets beyond surface level, leaving Smith and Leto with little to explore. Visually there are some cool stylish touches that I liked quite a bit. They’re unlike anything we’ve seen before in the crowded superhero movie space. But the drab and murky color palette doesn’t always help. And there are times where the CGI heavy action can be hard to decipher. Take the final 15 minutes which can be really hard to make out, right up to the film’s jarringly abrupt ending. Meanwhile Arjona offers a good supporting presence even if she isn’t given much to do. And there’s Tyrese Gibson in the thankless role of a generic FBI Agent trying to track Michael down after bodies drained of blood begin showing up across the Big Apple. Gibson is more of a plot device than an authentic character. Of course there are also two obligatory post credits scenes that confused me more than excited me. Sure, they tease interesting things to come. But they also reminded me of how convoluted this Sony/MCU collaboration has been. “Morbius” does little to change that. Leto is certainly up for the role, and I can see where he could have done something special with a better script and more focused direction. As it is, “Morbius” is a ‘middle of the road’ Marvel movie. One that ultimately teases more than it’s able to deliver. “Morbius” opens in theaters tomorrow.  I had fun watching it, although I thought character development was rather lacking and it didn’t feel like it really added anything to the vampire genre. I have no interest in this.  Then again, Jared Leto is a total turn-off for me.  I heard what they tried to do but I don’t think it’s going to work.  I think Sony just needs to focus on their other 2 films and make it good and not worry about creating a cinematic universe.  What they should really do is focus on The Amazing Spider-Man 3 by getting a filmmaker who can get the job done so that Andrew Garfield can have one final outing as Peter-Parker/Spider-Man and revolve it around the multiverse where he reunites with Gwen but it’s Spider-Gwen.  There’s already a fan-made poster with Emma Stone as Spider-Gwen.   Plus, they should get either Jude Law or David Thewlis as a guy named Dr. Steven Strange in that universe.  Just don’t make it bloated and keep Ari Arad away from the fucking set. I’ve never been so angry leaving a movie theater before.  I knew going in that this movie was not going to be good.  But I wasn’t expecting something so incompetent.  There had been a lot of questionable things I’ve been hearing and seeing about the marketing.  This is an awful movie.  For every good thing that it does, you get 50 things that are bad.  It’s not just the script, it’s the editing as well.  Jared Leto was quite good as Morbius.  I liked him and his relationship with Adria Arjona’s character.  The movie ultimately turned into an ugly CGI slug-fest.  I hope there’s going to be an extended cut somewhere down the road, because what we have here is a mess."

A handful of years ago Universal Studios tried to put up a new franchise of films milking the horror characters from their back catalogue, which included the great old black and white Mummy, Frankenstein and Dracula films.  Unfortunately the 2017 Tom Cruise film The Mummy wasn't lucrative and the concept seems to have been buried for now, but fuelled by their endless superhero film successes, Sony and Marvel have picked up the idea of villains becoming the heroes of their own franchise. Thus we now have two Venom films, and this week we have Morbius, a vampire villain from the Marvel comic books, usually a foe of Spider-Man or of the other Marvel vampire character, Blade.  Dr Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) has an inventive and brilliant mind trapped in a fragile body. He walks around with walking sticks, bent over, but that doesn't stop his research passion, which is to find a cure for his own ailment.  This brings us to the jungles of Costa Rica where Dr Morbius and his assistant, Dr Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), are on the trail of some bat DNA that - in direct violation of every medical practice and law - Morbius plans on directly injecting into himself.  That things aren't going to whatever plan Morbius may have had becomes apparent when the good doctor transforms into a fanged monster and slaughters every mercenary and ship crew member onboard, draining their blood, but leaving Dr Bancroft alive.  Back in New York, the transformed Dr Morbius is shut away in his laboratory, figuring out the new powers his transformation has given him, and coming to understand their limitations - particularly that his artificial blood has a limited affect and he increasingly needs human blood to thrive and survive.  But Morbius is the chief suspect in the slaying of the ship crew and is pursued by detectives Stroud (Tyrese Gibson) and Rodrigues (Al Madrigal), but he is also being pursued by another vampire figure. His boyhood pal Milo (Matt Smith), also sickly and disfigured from his lifelong illness, has taken Morbius's new DNA formula and has himself become superhuman.  The second half of the film is a battle between these two childhood friends, with Milo wanting Morbius to realise the great potential of their superhuman powers, the toll on human life be damned, and with Morbius clashing ethically and morally with his new life.  Growing up in the 1970s, I remember what my parents' 50-year-old friends looked like, and it wasn't like this aerobicised and buff rock star with Jesus looks and eyelashes to die for.  There's a lot going on inside Morbius's brain, but Leto is unfortunately let down by a pretty simple script, both in terms of the fairly derivative plot and uninspired dialogue.  Doctor Who's Smith comes off much better with the flashier role of Milo, especially once Milo regains his physicality. It allows Smith's natural gift for physical comedy to shine - he uses his big sharp vampire fangs to chew the scenery at every opportunity.  I mean the kind of darkness that makes you wonder what you are looking at or missing as the characters fight their way above and below New York City. The kind of darkness that won't look great on earlier-model flat-screen televisions as they try to resolve all those shades of black and dark grey.  Thanks to the dozens of Marvel superhero films, post-credit sequences are de rigueur these days and Morbius is no exception - or so I hear. "
"Jul 9, 2022",NEGATIVE,Even if you take the poor quality and bland performance from Leto out of consideration - Morbius barely feels like a movie&#46;
"Jul 8, 2022",NEGATIVE," THE BOB’S BURGERS MOVIEI was perplexed about how to talk about this movie as a longtime passionate fan of Bob's Burgers. On the one hand it was as enjoyable as any episode of the show and it was great to spend time with the Belcher family again. On the other, when I went to write a proper review of it a few days after the screening, I couldn't remember any of the specific jokes beyond the perpetual tease about whether Louise might lose her bunny ears... SENIOR YEAREvery time Netflix boasts how many “minutes” a movie has been watched, it becomes more clear that we’re living in a cinematic dystopia. It makes rating movies by a binary thumbs up or down (problematic) or measuring their worth with box office results (gross!) feel sane by comparison. It also requires actual math to correlate minutes with views. Even that won’t line up correctly because not everyone finishes a movie they start and some people watch in groups. Netflix briefly boasted about the performance of Senior Year, but who can know if anyone finished it or liked it. In this comedy a cheerleader wakes up from a coma in her 30s and goes immediately back to high school to finish out her senior year. If people shut it off early, one cannot blame them since it opens with a very long and completely unnecessary prologue, that a sharper film would have dispensed with over, say, a clever opening credits sequence. Comedies are meant to be zippy!  Hearing some dissent for Cha Cha Real Smooth makes me feel less like a grinch. What drove me crazy was reading reviews calling him a total charmer throughout - not in my book! The fact that he was trusted with kids so often in the movie when he was such a mess himself completely stressed me out. There is some writing talent there (and Johnson was great), but it wasn't for me. I tend to watch every Marvel film/series (I avoided ""Elektra"", though, given my dislike for Ben Affleck's ""Daredevil"", and this being a critically bashed spin off, of an already bad film), and the abysmal reviews of ""Morbius"" have led me to avoid it completely... it doesn't even seem a ""so bad it's good"" kind of enjoyable film, even. So I may catch it at some streaming service, but can't wait for Sony to give up their Marvel characters and return the rights to Disney... Outside the Spiderman MCU films, the only one that I enjoyed was Venom: Let there be Carnage, and it was mostly merit of Hardy and Harrelson's performances... I am impressed with Morbius for its ability to take a popular meme and deliver a thoroughly lackluster movie experience, leaving much to be desired in terms of storytelling, fnf character development, and overall quality."
"Jun 27, 2022",NEGATIVE,Falls apart at the halfway point due to its weak&#44; and at times&#44; laughable script and Jared Leto&apos;s lack of star power&#46; It does&#44; however&#44; have a certain &apos;B&apos; movie appeal&#46;
"Jun 25, 2022",NEGATIVE," Every studio wants a Marvel Cinematic Universe to call its own, or an equivalent that similarly takes a big bite out of the box office — and that very quest explains why Morbius exists. On the page, the character also known as 'the Living Vampire' has been battling Spider-Man since 1971. On the screen, he's now the second of the web-slinger's foes after Venom to get his own feature. This long-delayed flick, which was originally due to release before Venom: Let There Be Carnage until the pandemic struck, is also the third film in what's been dubbed Sony's Spider-Man Universe. As that name makes plain, the company is spinning its own on-screen world around everyone's favourite friendly neighbourhood superhero, because that's what it owns the rights to, and has started out focusing on villainous folks. So far, the movie magic hasn't flowed. If that explanatory opening paragraph felt like something obligatory that you had to get through to set the scene, it's meant to. That's how Morbius feels as well. Actually, that's being kinder than this draining picture deserves given it only has one purpose: setting up more films to follow. Too many movies in too many comic book-inspired cinematic universes share the same fate, because this type of filmmaking has primarily become $20-per-ticket feature-length episodes on a big screen — but it's particularly blatant here. Before the MCU's success, the bulk of Morbius would've been a ten-minute introduction in a flick about supervillains, and its mid-credits teasers would've fuelled the first act. Now, flinging every bit of caped crusader-adjacent material into as large a number of cinematic outings as possible is the status quo, and this is one of the most bloodless examples yet. Jumping over to the SSU from the DCEU — that'd be the DC Extended Universe, the pictures based around Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Suicide Squad and the like (but not including Joker or The Batman) — Jared Leto plays Morbius' eponymous figure. A renowned scientist, Dr Michael Morbius has a keen interest in the red liquid pumping through humans' veins stemming from his own health issues. As seen in early scenes set during his childhood, young Michael (Charlie Shotwell, The Nest) was a sickly kid in a medical facility thanks to a rare disease that stops him from producing new blood. There, under the care of Dr Emil Nikols (Jared Harris, Foundation), he befriended another unwell boy (debutant Joseph Esson), showed his smarts and earned a prestigious scholarship. As an adult, he now refuses the Nobel Prize for creating artificial plasma, then tries to cure himself using genes from vampire bats. Morbius sports an awkward tone that filmmaker Daniel Espinosa (Life) can't overcome; its namesake may be a future big-screen baddie, but he's also meant to be this sympathetic flick's hero — and buying either is a stretch. In the overacting Leto's hands, he's too tedious to convince as a threat or someone to root for. He's too gleefully eccentric to resemble anything more than a skit at Leto's expense, too. Indeed, evoking any interest in Morbius' inner wrestling (because saving his own life with his experimental procedure comes at a bloodsucking cost) proves plodding. It does take a special set of skills to make such OTT displays so pedestrian at best, though, and that's a talent that Leto keeps showing to the misfortune of movie-goers. He offers more restraint here than in Suicide Squad (not to be confused with The Suicide Squad), The Little Things, House of Gucci or streaming series WeCrashed, but his post-Dallas Buyers Club Oscar-win resume remains dire — Blade Runner 2049 being the sole exception. It mightn't have revived the film, but the answer to one of Espinosa's troubles could've been Matt Smith, who cuts a far more compelling figure as the grown-up version of Morbius' ailing pal Milo. The lanky Last Night in Soho star is saddled with a role somehow more cartoonish than Leto's, and with a character who doses himself with the same bat-derived serum but loves it — and, even without a spot of remorse for the body count he swiftly causes, he's the the most fascinating thing on-screen. Alas, in the latest underwhelming script by Dracula Untold, The Last Witch Hunter, Gods of Egypt and Power Rangers screenwriters Burk Sharpless and Matt Sazama, Morbius and Milo are meant to be two sides of the same coin, but there's no depth or poignancy to their relationship. It just feels like a means to an end, giving Morbius another struggle to brood over. That shouldn't come as a surprise seeing that's the movie's whole gambit as well. It doesn't help that the entire idea behind Morbius and Milo's friendship, and their reason for seeking a solution in bat DNA, is abhorrently ableist. Positing that both men can only be happy if they're free of their genetic ailment could never be anything else. Folks with a health situation that causes suffering may wish to farewell it, but the image of throwing away crutches, becoming more mobile, gaining extra senses and floating in the air is thoroughly tasteless when presented as the only alternative to having a medical condition. Doing something different would've required thought, however, which Morbius lacks again and again. No one could be bothered to flesh out its protagonist, or wonder why its villain outshines him, or worry that Leto and Smith have zero chemistry together, after all. And clearly nobody was concerned that the film looks wearyingly dull to suit its story, that its CGI is laughably atrocious and overdone at every moment, or that it's a vampire flick that's afraid of blood and gore. Amid the murky cinematography by Oliver Wood (Holmes & Watson) and erratic editing from Pietro Scalia (Solo: A Star Wars Story), each compounding the movie's woes, Morbius also includes a weak attempt at a romance courtesy of fellow researcher Martine (Adria Arjona, 6 Underground), plus a crime angle via detectives Stroud (Tyrese Gibson, Fast and Furious 9) and Rodriguez (Al Madrigal, Physical) — all thankless. Its stab at giving the superhero/supervillain realm a mad scientist skew, a monster-movie chapter and a gothic horror spin proves dead on arrival as well, as does its evident pilfering from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. That this is the best version of Morbius after almost two years spent sitting on a shelf is as illogical as the film's many plot holes. This misfire only sinks its teeth into bland monotony; vampires aren't the only things that suck within its frames."
"Jun 16, 2022",NEUTRAL," I wonder how many Marvel Comics Characters we have met over the last dozen or so years. Between all the films there have been well over twenty so far and in April we got to see another one come to the big screen in the feature film Morbius.  Starring Jared Leto (House of Gucci) and Matt Smith (Last Night In Soho), the movie grossed $163 million worldwide but was panned by critics who felt the writing and visual effects were subpar, especially for a Marvel film.  However, since the movie is part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe/Sony Spiderverse, it has a built-in audience, many of whom will be heading to stores to purchase the 4K Blu-ray combo pack. However, he soon discovers the experiment has turned him into a Vampire and has left him with blood lust.  He is able to temporarily stave off the cravings by feeding on the synthetic blood he creates but it is only a short-term remedy as the feeling of cessation lasts a little bit less after each ""feeding"". Meanwhile, Morbius' friend and financial backer is fellow ""blood brother"" Milo who gets angry when Morbius refuses to give him the cure.  Milo then steals the antidote and turns himself into a vampire as well but with less remorse for killing than Morbius. Leto is known as a ""method"" actor and that style of acting tends to work well for him. He has been known in the past to physically alter his appearance, gaining or losing weight as necessary and remaining in character throughout filming.  Surprisingly, this technique doesn't seem to work as well for him this time as it has in past performances.  His Morbius is very even-keeled rarely displaying the range of emotions we know he is capable of presenting,  Smith offers more in terms of character development as Milo explores a range of emotions from despair to elation to anger and selfishness.  The rest of the cast is fine but the script doesn't give them much to truly sink their teeth into (pun intended). The 4k disc is presented in Dolby Vision with a 2160p resolution.  Details are sharp and visuals are clean. Since much of this movie takes place in dark hallways or at night, black hues are important and the picture quality presents those tones beautifully.  The lossless Dolby Atmos audio is equally impressive as the visual presentation with ambient sounds bouncing from speaker to speaker for a fully immersive experience. Morbius fails to grab the audience from the beginning and a plot that has quite a bit of potential, simply put, falls flat.  Leto seems to be dialing in his performance which is a disappointment because he has so many incredible characters.  Within the MCU, Morbius would definitely be ranked towards the bottom of the list not simply because it has stiff competition. The 4K quality paired with Dolby Atmos audio and some very good extras give this film a boost, but it can't erase the script and effects that weigh Morbius down.

"Jun 13, 2022",NEUTRAL," Created by writer Roy Thomas and penciler Gil Kane, the vampiric villain Dr. Michael Morbius was debuted by Marvel Comics as an adversary to Spider-Man in 1971. Since then, Morbius has shifted from enemy of Spider-Man and vampire hunter Blade to hero, working alongside Doctor Strange, Man-Thing, and Ghost Rider. Until Jared Leto (House of Gucci) appeared on-screen in the role, Morbius had only transitioned to appearing officially in animated Spider-Man programs and video games, with live-action performances left on the cutting room floor in Stephen Norrington’s Blade (1997). Now, as part of Sony’s growing Spider-Man Universe, Morbius gets a proper live-action origin story that’s full of the kind of fantastical hijinks that make Venom (2018) and Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021) popcorn delights, except where the nonsense in those films felt like part of the charm, here it’s an utter drag. Thanks to the nearly 42 minutes of bonus materials included on the home release, audiences can get a peek behind the curtain and see that director Daniel Espinosa (Life) really did have big ideas that may have gotten squashed by the Sony moviemaking machine. Born with a rare condition that requires multiple blood transfusion a day, Michael Morbius (Leto) pushes himself to discover a cure for his condition. Along the way, he earns accolades for his life-saving artificial blood, but a cure always seems illusive. That is, until he considers an unorthodox idea to combine the genes of a vampire bat found in Costa Rica with human genes in hopes that the mammals’ unique blood coagulation ability might correct his condition. Though it works, it works too well, turning Michael into a living vampire possessing incredible superhuman strength and abilities with none of the weaknesses of vampiric myth. It’s bad enough that Michael has to figure out how to address his rising bloodlust that his artificial blood can’t quench, but when his similarly afflicted best friend Milo (Matt Smith) takes the cure for himself and holds a far stronger constitution for violence, it’s up to Michael to stop him from rampaging through New York and beyond. Having not been able to see Morbius until home video, there’s a lot about the film that got spoiled prior to seeing it. I’m not talking narrative beats (really nothing to spoil), but reactions to or thoughts on the VFX, characters, and the changes made to Morbius vs what the trailers indicated. Most commenters spoke on the false look of the vampire design of Morbius and Milo, comparing it to something from the long-running Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which ended in 2003. On this, I would disagree, with the transitions from human to vampire visage being far smoother and less rubbery in appearance with the practical applications being of smart design. As for the characters — yes, there’s a lot of trouble here as almost all of them are in a different movie. Leto is, at least, consistent throughout the film, playing a character driven by a long-held desire to correct what he perceives as a debilitating wrong. Given how frequently characters with disabilities are treated as either props for a central character, used as inspiration, or presented as entirely selfish, screenwriters Matt Sazama (Power Rangers) and Burk Sharpless (Power Rangers) designed a version of Morbius that is caring, connected, and, though driven to cure himself, is not interested in doing it at the expense of others. In this respect, Leto carries the responsibility well, keeping Morbius grounded even when things are at their most unhinged. Of course, Matt Smith, most famous for playing the Eleventh Doctor on the BBC’s Doctor Who, knows exactly what kind of movie he’s in and what kind of villain he’s to play, clearly having a blast once his Milo takes Michael’s treatment and becomes a living vampire as well. Unfettered by the same sense of conscience that Michael is, Milo’s desires for life are as amplified as his physical form, making for some sequences that Smith just gets to let loose in. Sadly, the supporting cast of Adria Arjona (Pacific Rim: Uprising), Jared Harris (Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows), Tyrese Gibson (Fast 9), and Al Madrigal (The Way Back) either seem to be in a different genre of film than the other two or are underutilized to the point of being there as a trope-filled sidekick/adversary. These four, especially, could bring some really good weight to their roles, adding some conflict to Michael in one greater way or another, yet the film seems more interested in what comes next post­-Morbius than what’s happening within the runtime. The entire MCU has been accused time and again of merely being a setup for the next film, but none of them, even the origin stories, have so egregiously wasted its cast as the final film version of Morbius does.

Then, of course, there’s the changes in the trailers. Considering how often in the history of trailers changes have been made or alternate/deleted scenes have been used to entice audiences to come to the theater, I’m willing to forgive the way (going all the way back to the first teaser for Morbius) the marketing implied a connection to Tom Holland’s Spider-Man: Homecoming trilogy by way of the graffiti tag calling Spider-Man a murderer and the use of Michael Keaton’s Adrian Toomes, a.k.a. the Vulture. Except the tag is gone in the final film and the interaction shown in the trailer is gone, replaced with two mid-credit scenes that, in-film context, make no sense. If the film itself had more logical sense on its own, I might be more willing to forgive the obvious setup for Sony’s long-gestated Sinister Six film, except there’s no logic at all within Morbius, so the attempt at building toward something larger just comes off as an insult.

How about the fact that the script wants the audience to believe that somehow, not even using CRISPER gene editing to somehow explain the mutation, that adding vampire bat genes to a human would turn them into a superpowered individual. I know we’re just supposed to go with the whole “radioactive spider bite” thing, but the films usually explain just enough so that we have a logical foundation before we get Maguire, Garfield, or Holland swinging through their neighborhood. There’s literally no explanation for why Michael is suddenly stronger, more agile, or thirsts for blood (as vampire bats aren’t like that). Also, while I will give credit for the visual representation of Michael’s echolocation ability in-ear and the color waves used to represent air currents, echolocation doesn’t work like fluid dynamics. Sure, Captain America’s shield may break the laws of physics, but there’s enough groundwork laid for how Cap operates and enough mystery to allow us to go along with how vibranium works that we can go with it. There isn’t a single moment in the film that accounts for why Michael becomes like he does other than to make Victor Frankenstein into his own monster or an André Delambre/Seth Brundle-type into a tragic monster made of his own hubris (The Fly). Seriously, it’s the kind of bad science that makes EoM editor Crystal Davidson *seethe*. Though Leto plays the conflicted/regretful Michael well, there’s nothing in the script that implies he’s on the trajectory of a hero, let alone an anti-hero. None of this even touches the bigger, more theatrical touches on the film, like the case of bats in Michael’s lab that Arjona’s Dr. Bancroft initially discusses like it’s a secret (his office is mostly clear windows) or how they “treat him [Michael] like a brother” when that’s not how bats function. As this is a home release review, there’s an opportunity within the bonus materials to see if some of the frustrations, irritations, or downright flabbergasting things within the film are explained. Through the six featurettes and single gag/blooper reel, there are plenty of discussions over the making of the film, but I can’t truly say there are any insights. Most of what we get are either spontaneous moments on-set or staged interviews, so the bulk of the bonus materials read like an extended piece of promotional material for the film rather than an in-depth look at its making. We do learn some things regarding the stunt work and the ideation behind the VFX work, but the real gems come from the totality of Espinosa’s words across the featurettes which imply a completely different artistic idea for Morbius versus the generic action/fantasy film we receive. Look, Morbius may be as bad as critics have said, but there’s a strange boldness about it, as though whomever made the editorial decisions (not film editor Pietro Scalia (Gladiator), but the person above Scalia) to use Morbius as a platform seriously misjudged the plan. Instead of thinking of the next film, focus on this one. Make a solid origin story that inspires audiences to go on an adventure with Michael and *want* to see what comes next. Sadly, even when one laughs at dreadful choices that make no sense, there’s little desire, scant curiosity to see what Toomes wants with Michael mostly because there’s no reason to care. Doesn’t matter if I can morb any time I want, why would I want to?"
"Jun 12, 2022",NEUTRAL," For quite a while now, Sony Pictures has been enjoying raking in quite a lot of money through the ""Spider-Man"" franchise, especially when it comes to the more recent films that are officially a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In an effort to expand on that foothold, they've also ventured into making films featuring the popular character ""Venom,"" both of which also made a tidy sum, despite rather poor reviews. Now they look to expand again by exploring a lesser-known character known as ""Morbius,"" aka ""The Living Vampire,"" a noted enemy of Spider-Man and vampire hunter Blade. Would this further building of their ""Spider-Man Universe"" result in another smash hit, or would it prove to be the one that finally takes it too far? Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) and Lucien (aka Milo) (Matt Smith) first met as boys at a hospital in Greece, under the care of Dr. Emil Nicholas (Jared Harris). Years later, Morbius becomes a doctor and devotes his life to finding a cure for the rare blood disease that both he and Lucien suffer from. His latest attempt involves splicing the genes of vampire bats into his own, and while the cure does end up being successful, even giving him superhuman powers in the process, it has the nasty side effect of turning him into a vampire with a lust for blood. With two FBI agents on his trail for the deaths he caused during the experiment, and a growing need to feed on real blood (as opposed to his own synthetic creation), Morbius' problems only become worse when his old friend Lucien takes the cure himself, leading to a radical change in his personality. ""Morbius"" is one of those ideas that sounds like it should've worked pretty well, but obviously that would depend entirely upon the writers' ability to execute the idea in a manner that would be both compelling and entertaining. Unfortunately for this adaptation, it would appear that screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless were simply not up to the task of bringing this intriguing character to the big screen. From early on, the film struggles to find an engaging plot, depending on Morbius' transformation and subsequent lust for blood to carry the weight. Then, when they finally add a somewhat interesting plot element in the middle, it oddly ends up getting ignored until almost the very end of the film, ultimately turning it into a kind of waiting game as you patiently anticipate further development. Not helping the situation are the special effects that were clearly done by the lowest bidder, leading to rather silly-looking superpowers, fights, and creature designs. This is only compounded by curiously flat characters, and an unfortunately subdued lead performance from Oscar winner Jared Leto. Not that he had a whole lot to work with here, but even ""Doctor Who"" alumnus Matt Smith and the great Jared Harris were able to imbue their characters with a little personality with what little they were given. Again, this was certainly an idea that had some potential. It's just a shame that nearly every element that the filmmakers threw into it didn't work. Because of this, it feels as though the film simply never comes to life, settling for being an oddball collection of bland characters adrift in a film that's desperately in search of a more compelling plot. Given the film's mid-credit scenes, it seems clear that the original plan was to make a sequel, but now that future remains cloudy. One thing's for sure, if Sony should gamble on a sequel, it will need to be under far better quality control than this initial outing was, or else it seems inevitable that it will succumb to the exact same problems, and sadly leave the character's potential untapped. ""Morbius"" comes to Blu-ray in a 2.39:1, 1080p High Definition transfer of outstanding quality. This is another one of those films that's extremely dark during most of its runtime, but the image remains perfectly sharp and clear throughout. Likewise, the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track presents the dialogue, sound effects, and score in excellent quality, ultimately giving you the best possible experience in both areas. The extras include a selection of brief featurettes that mainly focus on the making of the film, including the stuntwork, visual effects, and a general look behind the scenes.  ""Morbius"" had the potential to be a rather exciting entry in Sony's expanding ""Spider-Man Universe,"" but sadly just about every element of the film ends up dragging it down, including a screenplay in search of a more compelling plot, a multitude of bland characters, cheap-looking special effects, and a very subdued lead performance from Jared Leto. The film's execution was simply mismanaged, ultimately leading to a film where the nicest thing that can be said is that at least its runtime is relatively brief."
"Jun 11, 2022",NEGATIVE," Sorry! We Missed It is a new Substream column where we’ll be looking at some movies and television shows from the beginning of the year. Life happens, you know? So, sit back and play some catch-up with us.  Making a shared universe between two movie studios is extremely hard. All the story pieces have to be in the right place, and creatives must be on the same page. Disney and Sony’s joint agreement to include Spider-Man in the MCU has proven to be a fruitful and profitable union. But that doesn’t mean every project would fit under the same umbrella. Sony’s Spider-Man Universe (SSU) has already immersed itself in the anti-hero territory of Venom and the beautiful animation of Into the Spiderverse. The studio was seeking to do the same with Morbius — at first; it has some interesting plot points of friendship through disability and scientific integrity. Not to mention, the character of Morbius is a vampire, something not seen yet in this iteration of recent films. However, whatever interest the film garnishes, Morbius quickly unfurls, not committing to any aspect that would make it complete. Once the film concludes, you feel that there’s so much more to be told. Odd, considering the movie is slightly over the hour and a half mark. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) is a brilliant scientist with a rare blood disease who is up for the Nobel Peace Prize for his artificial blood invention that has saved “more lives than penicillin.” This is a bit of the “physician heal thyself” irony considering the disease he’s inflicted with. But, Michael has been working on a potential cure (which may be both illegal and unethical) involving fusing bat and human DNA together. (what could go wrong with that?) Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), Michael’s working partner and maybe romantic interest, declares her concerns. Still, Michael promised his lifelong friend Milo (Matt Smith), who has the same disease and is filthy rich, that he’d find a cure. With Milo’s money and an experiment on a mercenary ship across international waters, Michael becomes his own test subject — which goes completely wrong for the men in the vicinity in a bloody, vicious fashion. Mostly, Leto’s portrayal of Morbius is one of a person who is highly conflicted about what he has done. His cure is a curse, and for most of Morbius, Michael is wallowing in it when he’s not having a video-game-style tutorial of his new powers. Matt Smith seems to have the most fun in his portrayal of Milo — yet the film gives his character little to latch onto concerning his motivations. Is Milo jealous of the hinted romance between Morbius and Martine? Is the new DNA only enhancing the downright lousy person and the ugliness inside him? Well, it’s not so clear. The only brief flashback we get of young Milo and Michael has them getting separated because Michael gets into a medical school in New York. As Michael leaves, Milo gets bullied once, but there seems to be no resentment — that seems like a missed opportunity to establish conflict. Morbius’s supporting characters seem to be there to take up time. Emil Nikols (Jared Harris) serves as the father figure for both Michael and Milo, but is aside from scenes at the beginning of the film; he is primarily absent until the “what have you become” monologue. Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal play FBI detectives Simon Stroud and Al Rodriguez, who either show up at a crime scene or briefly interrogate someone. The quality of action scenes and computer graphics also taper off as the film continues. In the beginning, Morbius’s first transformation looks good, and the horror style of his first kills displays an interesting template the film could build upon. Unfortunately, that’s where things end — the facial transformations leave much to be desired, and the bullet-time usage seems a little dated. After-credit scenes rarely make or break a film. Morbius’s choice to include the two doesn’t make much sense in the whole grand scheme of the multiverse and its rules. If there even was any to begin with. Sony could have dove into the premise’s campiness and handled some of the stories with care. In the end, Morbius feels like a rush to cash in on the strides the studio made with its more impressive features.

"Jun 6, 2022",NEGATIVE," To say the Morbius joke has gone on too long is an understatement. After all, the movie was released on April 1st, more than two months ago. It struggled at the box office and became a punchline on the internet. The subject of many memes, Morbius did not find its audience. So it was a surprise when Sony/Columbia announced the film would return to 1000 theaters in the first weekend of June. How would the film fair this time around, and would I go and watch it? The answer to the second question was, unfortunately, yes. For those unaware, Morbius follows the story of Doctor Michael Morbius (Jared Leto), a scientist suffering from genetic diseases. In hopes of curing himself and his best friend Lucien/Milo (Matt Smith), Leto performs illegal experiments and trials that may offer him a cure for his disorder. With the help of Milo’s money and fellow doctor Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), Morbius begins human trials for a new treatment for himself. However, the formula does not have the intended effect, instead of turning him into a creature that obtains vampiric powers. After feeding on the boat’s crew and discovering new bodies are turning up in New York, Morbius must race against the clock to find a cure to his latest condition. My Morbius nightmare over, having gone to see it for a second time, I had reaffirmed my feelings towards the film. I initially saw the movie on its opening day. Bad buzz was abound, but I had avoided reviews to have as clean of a viewing experience as possible. I did not have a visceral reaction to the quality when it was over. While I had not been overly impressed, I thought it was flat. Nothing had been so bad it appalled me, and nothing wowed me. I had hoped that two months would help the air clear and potentially open the door for a better viewing experience. I was wrong. Morbius remains a shockingly dull and boring film. Most of the issues stem from the early 2000s approach to the film. As Morbius progresses, the active campaign to distance its characters from their comic book origins becomes increasingly frustrating. One wonders why Daniel Espinosa was interested in the film if he simply wanted to strip the comic book content from it at every turn. Instead, Morbius intends to be a tragedy with an edgy protagonist that wallows in black and gray costumes. The lack of color extends to most scenes, with the lone exception coming during flying sequences (where purple and orange accents help liven the film). The film actively chooses the most tedious path for the story at nearly every opportunity. The action sequences quickly become the highlight of the film, adding some of the only dynamic visuals to the film as a whole. However, they are often bogged down by the inconsistent CGI throughout the film. Slow-motion streaks appear in the sky when Morbius flies, but when he fights a second vampire, the colors blend together to create a sludge that runs across the screen. Even when the film gets this right, it fumbles away an interesting gimmick. The CG only gets worse, especially during transformations that make Angel look like An American Werewolf in London-level makeup. Leto can be blamed for most issues, but there’s too much wrong to lay it all on his shoulders. He does little to lift the material, but there’s not much to the screenplay. After all, either he ad-libbed “the stinky pinky” line, or it was in the script from the start. Either way, not ideal. Additionally, he appears bored on-screen, which extends to sequences with Arojna. Leto and Arjona have no chemistry, despite the film telling us ad nauseum that they do. Perhaps the only good aspect of the film comes from Smith. He seems to get the movie’s vibe on the page, even as everyone else around him turns it into a laborious task. His energy is infectious and overcomes the tedious aspects of the film, but his lack of screen time forces us to wait for his return. He plays a Verbal Kint moment well, and sadly the film lets him die on a vine (instead of finding ways to incorporate him more in the movie). The actual text of the film suffers from illogical moments from most of its characters and apparent studio interference. There’s a question about whether the studio stripped even more extraneous plotlines from the film or if they realized that any longer in the theater was only going to have audiences even angrier about the time they would lose to this film. Morbius suffers from a case of the doldrums, and with very few opportunities for the cast to liven up the material, the movie simply languishes towards an unappealing ending. When you then tack on the worst back-to-back post-credit scenes of the last decade, Morbius achieves nothing and becomes too forgettable to build a franchise on its discarded bones. Sadly, the fiasco and the memes will force us all to waste our breathe on a film that does not deserve the slightest attention."
"Jun 3, 2022",NEUTRAL," Marvel is back to teaming up with Sony for some reason, and this time it's MORBIUS, the Jared Leto vampire character again, for some reason. Where does this lead and how do we feel after experiencing all that was MORBIUS? All that and a big batch of Weekly Recommends this week on MAM!"
"May 23, 2022",NEUTRAL," Morbius, de nombre real Dr. Michael Morbius, nace en los cómics de Spider-Man como un antagonista del hombre arácnido. Fue en The Amazing Spider-Man #101 (si la Wikipedia no miente), creado por el (mítico) guionista Roy Thomas con lápices (del no menos mítico) Gil Kane. Su personaje fue evolucionando de villano a anti-héroe, Morbius más que superheróe es un super anti-héroe, en su propia línea de cómics además de asociarse con todo tipo de personajes de Marvel que irían desde el Motorista Fantasma a Blade, pero al que más ha estado ligado ha sido siempre a Spider-Man.  Tras no pocos avatares llega ahora su adaptación cinematográfica de la mano de Daniel Espinosa (Suecia, 1977), director de El invitado (Safe House) (2012), El niño 44 (Child 44) (2015) y ese pseudo-Alien pseudo-La Cosa que fue Life (2017), de nuevo con Ryan Reynolds. El guión de Morbius lo firman Matt Sazama y Burk Sharpless, el tandem firmante de, ojo, Drácula: La leyenda jamás contada (2014) -la protagonizada por Luke Evans-, Dioses de Egipto (2016) y Power Rangers (2017), además de la serie de Netflix (2018) Lost in Space. Y esa sería la receta de este gazpacho multireferencial que Marvel, por la rama de Sony Pictures, ha acabado por dar forma a la película protagonizada por Jared Leto (Morbius), Matt Smith (Milo), Adria Arjona (Martine Bancroft) y Jared Harris (Dr. Nichols). Y casi os diría que Jared Leto es la única razón por la que se ha hecho la película y, como casi siempre ocurre con él, también la única razón para verla. Vamos con la película. Estaríamos, para que nos hagamos una idea, en la misma liga de serie B superheroica de gran presupuesto que ejemplificarían películas como Venom (2018) (Marvel) o Bloodshot (2020) (Valiant). Es decir películas hechas con un descaro nada escondido de tratar de explotar el blockbuster de superhéroes que copa nuestras vidas desde hace ya años, sólo que con menos ideas, menos presupuesto, menos calidad y, en líneas generales, más cachondeo. Con todo: películas que parecen funcionar y que tienen sus fans, siempre presentes, cuando se trata de lanzar películas ligadas a los cómics.  Ahora, Morbius, que parece una película de hace 30 años (es terriblemente anacrónica, por no decir vieja), mezcla sin pudor el ser una película de génesis superheroico con un film estrictamente de vampiros. Pero vaya, por argumento, ideas visuales, acabado de las imágenes, líneas argumentales de llevarse las manos a la cabeza, estaríamos en la peligrosa zona donde habitan títulos como el Van Helsing (2004) de Hugh Jackman o La liga de los hombres extraordinarios (2003) o en los años noventa La sombra (1994) de Russell Mulcahy o (1996) The Phantom de Simon Wincer. De nuevo, una serie B con mucho efecto digital que trata de esconder los llamativos agujeros argumentales o la propia simpleza del argumento. Tiene algo Morbius, tanto por sus maquillajes digitales vampíricos como por sus discusiones a bocajarro tomándose tan en serio que sólo produce hilaridad, a una especie de versión culebrón (venezolano, no turco) de Buffy, Cazavampiros (1997). Y eso, que podría ser una virtud: que Morbius fuera tan camp que se disfrutara desde sus bajos fondos, acaba por no serlo tanto, precisamente por lo en serio que se toma a sí misma. Algo que, por ejemplo, no le pasa a las películas de Venom. Y eso que tiene cosas que son imposible de tomarse en serio. Por ejemplo: la pareja de policías. En la película hay dos policías que se dedican a investigar a Morbius y los crímenes que van apareciendo en la ciudad con los cadáveres completamente vaciados sin sangre. Pues bien, creo que no me equivoco cuando digo que son los detectives más innecesarios de todo el cine de superhéroes. ¡No sirven para nada! Solo para dar más metraje a una película que acaba haciéndose larga y eso que es de las películas de duración más corta (dentro del mundo superheroico). Pero cerremos la crítica con algo positivo de la película. Jared Leto y Matt Smith, Morbius y Milo, los dos actores y personajes principales, creo que ambos van a muerte con la obra. Porque quizás Morbius sea una película endeble y ridícula por momentos, pero ellos se lo toman como si estuvieran haciendo una película de Christopher Nolan (en vez de Daniel Espinosa). Tanto Leto, retorciéndose y transformándose en su dolor humano-vampírico, como Smith, holgándose un villano jocoso al que le aplica no poco flow de caderas, lo dije al principio, son la principal razón para poder disfrutar de una película que busca desesperadamente ser franquicia, sin que tengamos muy claro si eso acabará por conseguirse o no (la escena post-créditos en ese aspecto es de traca: el perfecto resumen del absurdo que invade todo el entuerto). Un bioquímico sufre una extraña enfermedad en la sangre. Mientras trata de curarse y dar una respuesta a su trastorno, se infecta sin darse cuenta con una forma de vampirismo. Aunque debería haber muerto, tras la cura, Michael se siente más vivo que nunca y adquiere dones como fuerza, velocidad, capacidad de ecolocalización, además de una necesidad irresistible de consumir sangre. Trágicamente convertido en un imperfecto antihéroe, el Doctor Morbius tendrá una última oportunidad, pero ¿a qué precio? "
"May 21, 2022",NEGATIVE," The shared universe concept brings with it many possibilities,  yet as evident in Morbius there are limitations as well. In look, tone,  and sound, Morbius is nothing more than a stock Sony Pictures superhero  movie, a product at the end of a conveyer belt gone through the same  by-committee checks and balances as Venom before it.  Morbius tries to serve two masters in its attempt  to be a thrilling monster movie yet one that sticks to the confines of PG-13  accessibility so not to scare away the kids. Morbius not only lacks  style and personality, but it also lacks that most vital of ingredients: stakes  (not the vampire kind) worth investing in. To call Morbius a corporate  corpse of a movie is too kind. Morbius stars Jared Leto as Dr. Michael Morbius, a  genius biogeneticist who suffers from a rare blood disorder. When Morbius takes  an experimental remedy of human and vampire bat DNA, he becomes a âliving  vampireâ embodied with supernatural powers of strength and flight, but also an insatiable  bloodlust.  Perhaps the most bland and bloodless vampire movie since  the Twilight films, Morbius is especially toothless in its  lack of personality in character and world building. Director Daniel Espinosa (Life),  no doubt at the behest of Sonyâs corporate lords, does little to establish that  we are watching a vampire movie and the implications â the tragedy, the  romance, the terror â that comes with it. Cinematography from the usually solid Oliver Wood (The  Bourne Ultimatum) is cookie cutter digital sheen tosh complete with  generic grey-scale tint. Visual effects and creature designs are not much  better, an unimaginable riff on vampire monster effects seen beforehand. Worst yet are the action scenes. Espinosa throws us into  a blender of digital pixels as he shaky camâs his way through unbearable and  unwatchable fight sequences that only succeeds in provoking the upchuck reflex.  As Morbius, Jared Leto delivers a much quieter superhero  performance than we are used to, letting those rock star looks carry the weight  that a razor thin script by Matt Sazama and Burt Sharpless do not provide.  Fairing much better is Matt Smith in the villainous role  of Milo, a surrogate brother to Morbius who shares the same disease and partakes  in the same vampiric remedy, embracing the monster he has become. Smith brings  a swagger and ferociousness to the movie that, sadly, isnât enough to save Morbius from its fate as one of the worst, lifeless superhero movies seen in some time."
"May 19, 2022",NEUTRAL," Morbius (EE.UU. / 2022). Dirección: Daniel Espinosa. Guion: Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless. Fotografía: Oliver Wood. Elenco: Jared Leto, Matt Smith, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris. Duración: 108 minutos. Calificación: Apta para mayores de 13 años. Distribuidora: UIP. Nuestra opinión: regular. La era de la supremacía de las adaptaciones de cómics al cine implica una forma nueva de entender los géneros cinematográficos. No todos los cómics son iguales, ni sus protagonistas corresponden a un mismo tipo de superhéroe o villano. Esto le permite a los estudios hacer películas de distintos géneros, manteniéndose dentro de ese universo de los superhéroes que atrae al gran público. Spider-Man es el personaje ideal para una comedia adolescente sobre las dificultades de crecer y Batman para un film noir. El público abraza estas películas, tal como sus taquillas lo demuestran, siempre que vengan junto con un nombre y una figura reconocibles. Y que tengan superpoderes o habilidades que rozan lo sobrehumano, claro. Morbius, basada en un cómic de Marvel, podría ser una película de terror sobrenatural, más específicamente, “una de vampiros”, con condimentos de “una de científico loco”. Porque son esos arquetipos del terror clásico en lo que se convierte Michael Morbius, interpretado por Jared Leto, menos escondido en el maquillaje y vestuario que de costumbre, un hombre que sufre desde su infancia una enfermedad de la sangre, que lo mantiene en un estado general debilitado y le garantiza una muerte temprana. Como tantas otras películas basadas en cómics, Morbius es una historia de origen del personaje. El film, dirigido por Daniel Espinosa, presenta a su protagonista en su infancia, en una clínica en Grecia, donde conoce a otro chico que tiene la misma enfermedad, al que apoda Milo. Michael tiene una inteligencia extraordinaria, por lo que el médico que cuida a ambos niños, encarnado por Jared Harris, lo envía a estudiar a Nueva York. Así, se convierte en médico y dedica su vida a encontrar una cura para su enfermedad, con la ayuda de la doctora Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) y el apoyo financiero de Milo (Matt Smith). La creación de una sangre artificial parece acercarlo a la solución, pero, por supuesto, todo se complica. “No crees en estas cosas, ¿no?”, le dice Martine a Morbius, luego de leer un libro sobre vampiros. Tal vez esa línea sea un guiño para despegarse del terror sobrenatural, aunque la explicación “científica” sobre lo que le sucede a Morbius sea tan improbable como las historias de vampiros. Sin embargo, lo mejor de la película es cuando sigue las pautas del género de terror y fantástico: una escena en un pasillo con la luz titilando escondiendo un peligro inminente; la transformación física de hombre a monstruo; hasta la referencia a Murnau, director de Nosferatu, en el nombre de un barco. Morbius pierde cuando intenta ser una película de superhéroes grandilocuente, con sexualidad contenida y una investigación policial conducida por un agente latino “gracioso” y Tyrese Gibson haciéndose el serio. Mientras es un poco ridícula y humilde en sus pretensiones, la película ofrece algo con que divertirse. Pero cuando llega la hora de las peleas con efectos visuales poco efectivos y planos en los que literalmente no se entiende lo que se está viendo, acecha el aburrimiento y deja al descubierto la vacuidad de todo el proyecto. © Copyright 2024 SA LA NACION | Todos los derechos reservados.

"May 18, 2022",NEUTRAL," Dos años antes, 1971, de que Anne Rice escribiera (aunque no se publicara hasta 1976) 'Entrevista con el vampiro', Roy Thomas (en el guión) y Gil Kane (a los estilizados lápices) presentaban en las páginas de 'The Amazing Spider-Man' a Michael Morbius, médico transformado en un vampiro viviente con tantos remordimientos ante su sed de sangre y hálito trágico como el Louis de la seminal novela de Rice, y con un enemigo tan sádico y hedonista como el atractivo Lestat. Morbius pasó a convertirse, en los años dorados de la Marvel terrorífica, en un personaje recurrente de las tramas del trepamuros, pero también lograría una serie de historietas independientes y una publicación un poco Guadiana en la que sus orígenes y mitología quedaban al descubierto. 'El vampiro viviente' pasó a ser la versión científica de Drácula, un doctor Jekyll que como Bruce Banner/La Masa se convertía en una criatura imprevisible, torturada y que luchaba por frenar sus impulsos de Mr. Hyde.  Que Daniel Espinosa y sus guionistas apuesten por esa fidelidad a los tebeos de terror de los años 70 en este 'Morbius' que se estrena por fin es un detalle que pocos sabrán agradecer. 'Morbius' no se permite ni un chiste, ni un momento de guiño cómplice al universo Marvel que triunfa en la Disney y que en su propio mundo cinematográfico, el de la Sony, tiene a 'Venom' con dos films que son pura comedia descerebrada y puro troleo a las superproducciones marvelitas. 'Morbius' (salvo ese Daily Bugle en el puesto de periódicos y revistas) solo se acuerda de lo que el mainstream de la Casa de las Ideas en cine ha certificado como canon en sus dos escenas poscréditos, una puerta abierta a seguir hablando de Spider-Man sin poder utilizar a Spider-Man pero sí a los secundarios de sus páginas. 'Morbius' es una película de vampiros, sin demasiada sangre y sin gore (apostaría a que el montaje final ha suavizado muchísimo lo rodado), pero canónica. Sí, es 'Entrevista con el vampiro' (el enfrentamiento entre Michael y Milo), pero también es el 'Martin' de George A. Romero (en ambos largometrajes la ciudad es un espacio en descomposición) y, por no alejarnos del territorio Marvel, 'Blade'. Es una tragedia y una historia de amor que Bram Stoker y Terence Fisher aplaudirían, pero seguramente más el David Cronenberg de 'La mosca'. ¿Que esto defraudará a los marvelitas millenials nacidos al calor de las películas recientes, incluso de las del Sonyverse? Tal vez. Personalmente aplaudo la decisión plenamente de género y fiel al personaje creado por Thomas y Kane. Y aplaudo a Daniel Espinosa, un muy buen director (ahí está 'Life', su particular 'Alien, el octavo pasajero') que en 'Morbius' filma con estilo (la secuencia del metro), sabe cómo utilizar el color (el rojo sobre todo) y cómo hacer de lo contrahecho una elegía de la artesanía. Una sinfonía, acaso no espectacular, del horror que es Marvel en estado puro.

"May 16, 2022",NEGATIVE," Desde la infancia, Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) ha sufrido de un raro y fatal trastorno de la sangre. Sin embargo, en lugar de rendirse a su destino, él mismo descubre una cura que debería permitirle llevar una vida normal. El ahora renombrado científico de treinta y tantos años deposita sus esperanzas en los murciélagos vampiros, cuyas peculiaridades quiere utilizar para sí mismo. De hecho, sus experimentos ilegales tienen éxito y desarrolla poderes inesperados. Al mismo tiempo, sin embargo, también desarrolla un deseo por la sangre humana. Su mejor amigo Milo (Matt Smith), quien también sufre de esta enfermedad, tiene el mismo deseo de convertirse en vampiro.  Cualquiera que esté esperando ansiosamente que la avalancha de adaptaciones de cómics de superhéroes termine en algún momento ha tenido que soportar un gran revés recientemente. Spider-Man: No Way Home se ha convertido, con gran sorpresa, en la película más exitosa desde el estallido de la pandemia de coronavirus. Con ganancias de taquilla de casi 1.900 millones de dólares estadounidenses, fue suficiente para ocupar el sexto lugar en el Top 10 actual de todos los tiempos.The Batman no puede competir con eso, pero el resultado fue muy impresionante para un thriller de crimen oscuro que tiene casi tres horas de duración Especialmente porque se sabe que DC Comic tiene un poco de crisis en los cines de vez en cuando. Sin embargo, si bien estas dos películas fueron eventos que algunos habían estado anticipando durante años, las perspectivas de éxito de Morbius son justas, aunque el público y el estudio se mantuvieron algo escépticos. En primer lugar, el personaje del título está, por supuesto, significativamente menos establecido que los dos colegas mencionados anteriormente. De hecho, el vampiro apareció por primera vez en un cómic hace más de 50 años como el antagonista de Spider-Man. Desde entonces ha aparecido una y otra vez, especialmente en relación con el hombre araña, pero también en el contexto del cazador de vampiros Blade. Sin embargo, a Morbius difícilmente se le llamaría importante. La última vez que Morbius (el personaje), en realidad comenzó a crecer de manera constante en los cómics fue en la década de 1990. El hecho de que Sony Pictures lo convirtiera en el centro de una película sonaba más como una búsqueda cínica y desesperada de nuevas fuentes de ingresos. No tenías muchas licencias, así que tenías que tomar las que podías. Morbius se basa en el caso del científico loco, que sigue siendo muy popular en el género de terror, pero también es un cliché, y trata de retratar al, inicialmente, frágil protagonista como una figura trágica y ambivalente. Por un lado, se puede entender la determinación con la que Michael trabaja para encontrar una solución al problema. Por otro lado, supera masivamente los límites científicos y finalmente desencadena una terrible espiral de eventos. El director Daniel Espinosa y los guionistas Matt Sazama y Burk Sharpless, que escribieron la menos que impresionante película vampírica lacrimógena Dracula Untold, muestran más que un interés fugaz, pero no en el dilema y el desarrollo de su personaje principal. El sufrimiento de Michael, sus habilidades especiales como reparador e investigador y su impulso para vencer la enfermedad establecen flashbacks funcionales, en los que también se presenta a su mejor amigo Milo. Mientras que este último, atormentado por la misma aflicción, permanece al cuidado de su médico (Jared Harris) en un centro de gracias y tiene que soportar ataques de intimidación, su amigo tiene la oportunidad de seguir una carrera científica en Nueva York. En la edad adulta, el rico Milo (Matt Smith), cuyo verdadero nombre es Lucien, conoce el trabajo de Michael y se emociona cuando se entera de su gran avance. El hecho de que Morbius pague un alto precio y de repente represente una amenaza para su entorno no le molesta en lo más mínimo. Más bien, Milo anhela finalmente saborear la vida. En este punto, la película podría tomar un camino interesante, contando cómo una amistad se desmorona de manera dolorosa, cómo Milo se ve atraído lentamente hacia el abismo. Sin embargo, el guion lo posiciona de manera tan descarada y rápida como un villano intrigante que no se detendrá ante nada que el efecto dramático y emocional se desvanezca rápidamente. Matt Smith, quien ya realizó una actuación siniestra en el thriller psicológico de Edgar Wright Last Night in Soho, también demuestra en Morbius que puede parecer maravillosamente loco y malvado. La conclusión es que Milo es solo un cracker sin carisma real. Su ataque completo, lujuriosamente destructivo y aparentemente aleatorio, contra el cual lucha Michael, carece de la nota épica. Todo el asunto no es cine, sino un episodio de televisión con un contenido manejable. Por último, pero no menos importante, el manejo descuidado de Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), la colega del protagonista, a quien, molestamente, se le permite contribuir con casi nada al progreso, encaja en la imagen. Espinosa y compañía se contentan con hacer que la joven se vea bonita, lo que simplemente confirma viejos estereotipos cinematográficos. En vista de las limitaciones narrativas, incluso algunas peleas concisas y algunos efectos psicodélicos con estilo de Morbius no pueden hacer una experiencia emocionante. Por otro lado, dentro de las aventuras estrictamente estandarizadas de Marvel, un viaje al género de terror sería un cambio bienvenido. Desafortunadamente, Doctor Strange negó sus orígenes a este respecto y luego solo ofreció más de la fórmula ganadora. The New Mutants fue un poco más atrevido en ese sentido, pero tuvo que lidiar con problemas completamente diferentes. Con Morbius, inicialmente parece que aquí podría tener lugar una alternativa a las adaptaciones de cómic habituales. Cuando el vampiro, sin quererlo, causa un verdadero baño de sangre después de su experimento fallido, eso es un marcado contraste con los héroes y heroínas que de otro modo se pueden ver en la pantalla. Pero eso es solo el comienzo. Más tarde, como era de esperar, Morbius es reinterpretado como bueno, lo que, por supuesto, nunca dañaría a nadie por sí solo. Milo, por otro lado, se supone que asumirá este papel. En teoría, hay una mayor dosis de emoción cuando dos mejores amigos de repente se convierten en enemigos. Pero esta amistad no es realmente palpable, por lo que el efecto es muy limitado. En cambio, todo se reduce al esquema habitual de dos personas enfrentadas que tienen habilidades muy similares, pero una es buena y la otra es mala. Venom  tampoco hizo eso. En términos de contenido, ambos colegas de Sony Marvel son prácticamente ceros que ni siquiera intentan contar una historia. En comparación, el antihéroe parásito es mucho más entretenido. Por un lado, el conflicto entre Venom y su anfitrión sigue causando comentarios y chistes. No es original, pero es divertido. Sin embargo, Morbius, sobre todo, no puede contrarrestar nada en términos de actuación. Mientras que Venom vivió en gran parte de un Tom Hardy siempre efectivo, Jared Leto parece muy anémico y terriblemente aburrido, no solo por la condición médica de su personaje. Matt Smith, que saborea la maldad de su personaje, lo hace mejor. Pero incluso se siente banal. Como el director Daniel Espinosa (Safe House, Life) no encuentra ningún medio de puesta en escena para hacer que la historia desechable sea más interesante, Morbius puede no ser el fracaso total que se predijo de antemano. Pero es otro filme para perder el tiempo. Rubén Peralta Rigaud nació en Santo Domingo en 1980.

"May 16, 2022",NEUTRAL," Tras ganar el Oscar por Dallas Buyers Club: El club de los desahuciados y protagonizar hace poco la serie WeCrashed, Leto da vida al vampírico personaje que da título a esta muy poco sorprendente película del Spider-Verse, uno de los tantos universos del emporio Marvel."
"May 14, 2022",NEUTRAL," A biochemist with a rare blood disease tries to cure himself of a deadly ailment, yet accidentally infects himself with a form of vampirism instead. Moviegoers went into ""Morbius"" to cure themselves of a lack of entertainment but accidentally infected themselves with a bad movie instead. Daniel Espinosa's film isn't awful by definition, but it's another reminder that when a comic book adaptation is produced poorly and without a real identity, the stink is much worse when you leave the theater. Since Hollywood is feeding off the overload of comic flicks at the moment, we can expect this ratio to hold up. All one can really hope for is that future products are better than ""Morbius."" Played by Jared Leto with only a small quiver of personality, Dr. Michael Morbius has spent his entire life hunting for a cure to a blood condition that affects him and his best friend, Milo (Matt Smith). Michael is smart and cunning yet running out of time so when a test of a new drug on a mouse reviews a level of success, the good doctor gambles with the hopes of curing not only him and his friend, but everybody else dealing with the problem. If you've watched one of these types of movies before, you know things do not go according to plan. As a man reborn into something he's not quite sure of, Leto doesn't run with the role. He seems more confused and hesitant than usual. Gone is the guy who invented four different accents in ""House of Gucci,"" and in his place is a guy staring down a paycheck performance that took years to find audiences due to the pandemic. Michael's eyes start to change shape and color when he flips to vampire mode; only if the movie got better too. In some cases, an Oscar-winning star can save a pile of junk like this. Instead, it looks like he filmed this while on tour with 30 Seconds to Mars. One can only wonder if he had switched roles with the charismatic Smith, who seems to be acting in another movie entirely. Initially, Smith's Milo is a feeble yet earnest friend of Michael's who hopes there is a cure. Once in possession, Milo becomes this dancing, bumbling Joker type. I didn't buy it. The filmmakers could have really dug into the construct of a friendship dissolving into madness, but it just follows the playbook written by other, much better movies. Outside of a couple impressive special effects sequences, nothing in ""Morbius"" is fresh. It's recycled, familiar, and worst of all, forgettable. The feeling given is that this is a movie Sony and Marvel pushed out into the lion's pit to be devoured by critics, even releasing it fully into theaters on April Fool's Day. But it's not a joke. The movie isn't good at all. It also rips off themes and action setups from ""The Matrix,"" and not in a ""that's cool"" sort of way. Seeing Leto's face shift from human to mad vamp loses its allure after a couple glimpses, and the same goes for Smith. Their makeup jobs aren't bad, but way too campy for the movie they're in. Little fits together in Espinosa's movie, which remarkably only has two sets of hands on the screenplay. Those showing up expecting a decent portion of Michael Keaton's superb villain Adrian Toomes from ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" will be disappointed when he shows up very late. Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal's hapless cops also seem to be in another remote B-movie about cops always being three steps behind. The esteemed Jared Harris is wasted in a supporting role, playing a part only created to prop up the angst between the hero and his adversary. There are two credits sequences, both of which add little to the story, even if they do try and tease a sequel. Now, few people I know would confuse me with a gambler but a long-delayed movie with a ghostly lead performance with a current Rotten Tomatoes score of 19% may not garner a second look. ""Morbius"" isn't the movie you need to forget exists altogether, but it definitely should be the sixth choice at your neighborhood Redbox in a few weeks."
"May 13, 2022",NEUTRAL," Tras haber sufrido una enorme cantidad de retrasos con su fecha de estreno –originalmente estaba pautada para julio de 2020–, finalmente Morbius, la más reciente película del universo arácnido de Sony Pictures, ha llegado a la gran pantalla. Pero después de todo este tiempo, la verdadera pregunta es: ¿valió la pena esperar casi dos años para al fin ver a Jared Leto como el vampiro viviente, y archienemigo de Spider-Man? La respuesta es… definitivamente no. Para ir directo al grano, el filme se siente vacío, sin un propósito real, ni un objetivo claro. Incluso, pareciera que es una película sacada directamente de principios de la década del 2000. Su trama básica, y sus matices grisáceos, nos remontan a aquella época en la que Marvel recién comenzaba a incursionar en el cine. Hoy en día, en una era en la que los superhéroes dominan las taquillas del mundo, Morbius se siente como una película más del montón; una que no aporta nada, ni al espectador, ni al género en sí. Y menos, después de lo que Marvel Studios nos ha ofrecido con grandes producciones, como la tetralogía de Avengers, o más recientemente, Spider-Man: Sin camino a casa. El guion de este largometraje, escrito por Matt Sazama y Burk Sharpless, tiene una enorme cantidad de carencias. El argumento es débil, y el rumbo de su trama nunca termina por definirse. Para colmo, cuando pareciera que la historia al fin va a tomar un camino interesante, que tal vez nos podría conducir hacia un desenlace cuando menos decente, la película termina de manera abrupta. Además, también contamos con un antagonista plano, cuyas motivaciones nunca son esclarecidas, y la razón por la que decide volverse un villano, raya en el cliché de lo obvio y lo absurdo. Es lamentable ver el montaje final del filme. Más si tomamos en cuenta el hecho de que el estreno de Morbius se pospuso por casi dos años. Perfectamente hubo tiempo de sobra para haber mejorado este aspecto. El ritmo se siente apresurado de principio a fin. Con tantos cortes en pocos segundos, no nos es posible terminar de procesar una imagen, cuando otra diferente se nos muestra. Esto mismo, durante las secuencias de acción, provoca que se vuelva muy difícil de distinguir lo que sucede en pantalla. Es confuso de apreciar la coreografía de cada pelea. Asimismo, esta edición tan atropellada también trae como consecuencia el hecho de que aparezcan y desaparezcan algunos personajes de la nada. Nunca se nos explica quiénes son, cuál es su propósito, ni cómo llegaron a esa escena en concreto. Esto es algo que se repite en diversos momentos del largometraje. Este montaje desordenado y caótico, acompañado de una historia dispersa, que no cuenta con una estructura adecuada, nos da como resultado un producto sin esencia. Su única razón de existir es para no devolverle a Marvel Studios los derechos de los personajes del universo de Spider-Man. De hecho, hay una propuesta interesante con los efectos, específicamente durante las secuencias de acción. Sin embargo, este trabajo pasa a segundo plano, cuando nos enfocamos de nuevo en el desastroso montaje. Otro elemento que podríamos llegar a rescatar de Morbius, son sus dos escenas a la mitad de los créditos. Sin duda alguna, emocionarán a más de uno. Aunque, sin decir spoilers, es importante resaltar que se nota a leguas que son escenas que colocaron una vez que la postproducción de la película había terminado. Es claro que éstas nunca estuvieron contempladas en el guion original, y, por lo mismo, se sienten sumamente forzadas, e incluso, carentes de lógica. Parece ser que la suerte de Jared Leto, como actor, ha ido en caída libre, desde que ganó el Óscar en 2014. Primero, por las duras críticas que recibió por su polémica versión del Joker en Escuadrón Suicida, y luego, por darnos una versión sobreactuada de Paolo Gucci en La casa Gucci, interpretación que lo hizo acreedor a un premio Razzie. Ahora, es el protagonista de, quizá, una de las peores películas bajo el sello de Marvel. Algo que resulta innegable es que, mientras que Marvel Studios continúa construyendo meticulosamente su universo cinematográfico, año con año, Sony Pictures produce películas sin un plan definido. Éstas sólo entorpecen al universo arácnido que han intentado construir con Venom y Venom: Carnage liberado. Lo único que nos queda esperar como fans, es que el fracaso de Morbius le sirva a Sony Pictures como lección. Y esperemos que esa lección aprendida haga que las próximas películas de Marvel, producidas por este estudio, tengan una mejor calidad, y principalmente, una verdadera razón de ser. Mientras tanto, sólo podemos imaginar la película que pudo haber sido Morbius, con una mejor dirección, y con un guion aceptable. El potencial estaba ahí, el compromiso de Jared Leto estaba presente, pero todo terminó en un gigantesco y deplorable tropiezo.

"May 12, 2022",NEGATIVE,"A failed experiment from Marvel that resembles something akin to Count Dracula's second cousin. 
[Full review in Spanish]
"
"May 4, 2022",NEGATIVE," ony should be basking in the reflected glory of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, thanks to their joint custody of Spider-Man with Disney. Instead, the studio seems intent on squandering this opportunity by releasing bland nonsense like Morbius, a dour slog with nary a redeeming feature. At the centre of the tale are two surrogate brothers, scientific genius Michael (Jared Leto, can do better) and wealthy Lucien (Matt Smith, deserves better), both of whom suffer from a rare blood disease. In the hopes of finding a cure for their shared malady, Michael covertly experiments with splicing the genes of vampire bats with human DNA. The resulting concoction rids him of his ailment and gives him bat-like superpowers, but also leaves him with a bit of an issue: a strong craving for and dependency on human blood. He initially feasts on artificial blood to satiate his urges but soon realizes that the synthetic stuff is gradually ceasing to satisfy his needs. Adding to his problems is the fact that the authorities are on his tail, even though another vampire murderer might be to blame for some of the carnage. How things unfold ranges from inconsistent to vague to illogical. A plot this derivative and nonsensical needs self-awareness and dark – even pitch black – wit to be palatable. Both, unfortunately, are conspicuously absent here. Instead, we have an uninteresting, patchy misfire that is unexciting and predictable from start to finish. The superhero elements are too dull to have any place in the current Marvel cycle. The horror elements are ineffective. The romance is unconvincing. Even the acting isn’t impressive. It’s not a good look for Leto that he has now been involved in two of the most boring superhero movies in recent memory. The film could have delivered a fun, goofy vampire adventure, a tone that would have been significantly more suitable for the weak plot. Or it could have fully embraced its horror leanings for some unabashedly gory fun. As a timid, self-serious drama though, the project fails to provide any level of entertainment. Morbius could and should have been so much better. There is inherent potential in the SSU; we can only hope that Sony makes better use of it the next time around."
"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE," Whereas Marvel movies are largely produced and distributed by Disney, Sony has managed, through high-stakes negotiations, to retain its license to all characters associated with Spider-Man. Having burned through many of the top-tier villains in Spider-Man’s canon, Sony needed to dig into the lesser-known creatures the web-slinger has contended with. This brings us to Morbius, directed by Daniel Espinosa and written by Matt Sazama and Buck Sharples. Michael Morbius (naturalistically portrayed by Jared Leto) has a severe medical condition. His blood coagulates into thick molasses, crippling his limbs and stunting his ability to breathe. When we meet the young Michael in a specialized clinic in Greece, he is attached to a machine that filtrates and thins his blood three times a day. This is how he and his successive roommates survive. Each of these roommates he has nicknamed Milo, including his newest one, Lucian (Matt Smith). Michael and Lucian/Milo develop a deep and abiding bond. They are sharply intellectual, bitingly sarcastic, and clearly see their demise in the middle distance. It is Lucian/Milo whose family’s wealth funds and powers Michael’s career forward, permitting the man to ascend to being the leading expert in blood-borne diseases. However, he has yet to address his malady successfully. An expedition to Costa Rica leads to a possible treatment involving splicing genetic material from Vampire bats with the DNA of the human sufferer. And thus, we realize his comic book condition: Michael Morbius is the human version of a vampire bat and must feed on blood. By feeding on human blood, he acquires bat-like powers such as echolocation, being remarkably strong, and the ability to fly. To provide any more plot would spoil Morbius. Needless to say, Michael Morbius will not be the only “living vampire” in this film. The acting is superb across the board. From Adria Arjona as Dr. Ballantine to Jared Harris’ Dr. Nicholas to Tyrese Gibson playing FBI agent Stroud, we have a most excellent cast supporting this flick. Leto portrays Michael Morbius in a most sincere and authentic manner, giving support to a hypothesis I have concerning beautiful people. The closer to a ’10’ a human rates on the physical beauty scale, the darker the nature they hide in their essence. From Fight Club to Requiem for a Dream, from Panic Room to House of Gucci, Leto has striven to portray that deep darkness he possesses in his heart of hearts. With Morbius, that darkness powers a most raw and subtle performance. This is tour de force acting from Leto, and it must be seen to be believed. Daniel Espinosa and his crew capably provide a rough and grungy Manhattan for Michael Morbius to hunt in. Morbius is a remarkable monster movie, powered by the brotherly love experienced by Michael and Lucian/Milo. While many have not enjoyed it, I found it superb. Seek this out if you like superhero films that are especially dark.

"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE," With THE LITTLE THINGS and his sensational, transformation in HOUSE OF GUCCI, Leto is totally invested and gives the Marvel Universe a mesmerizing character shaped with conflicting appetites. Let’s talk about Jared Leto’s public profile. Ever since he received the Best Supporting Actor award for DALLAS BUYERS CLUB, Leto’s choice of roles have been astonishing. He has pursued roles that completely erase his rock star beauty. After AMERICAN PSYCHO and FIGHT CLUB, he chose to lose 25 pounds to play a junkie in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. In CHAPTER 27 Leto gained weight and buried his movie star face to play outsider Mark David Chapman. Leto continued his metamorphic choices with the Joker in SUICIDE CLUB, a really unusual creepy killer in THE LITTLE THINGS and the brilliant performance in HOUSE OF GUCCI as Paolo Gucci. Leto continues his passion for physical transformation as Israeli Adam Neumann in the cable series WE CRASHED. Leto was condemned for taking his Joker role too far. His “method acting” involved sending the cast a dead pig at the very first table read. He refused to be called his real name on set and he “terrorized” his castmates with anal beads, live rats, and used condoms. Yet during the production of MY LEFT FOOT, Daniel Day-Lewis insisted that everyone on set refer to him as Christy Brown, refusing to reply to Daniel. Day-Lewis learned to type and paint with his feet just like Brown, as well as demanding to be pushed around in  a wheelchair. Day-Lewis’ refusal to leave his wheelchair meant that the film’s production assistants were forced to lift the actor over the masses of equipment to get him ready for his next scene. During the production’s lunch break the set assistants were made to spoon-feed Day-Lewis in accordance with the lifestyle of his character. Day-Lewis won the Academy Award for Best Actor for MY LEFT FOOT. Robert De Niro gained 60 pounds to emulate Jake La Motta's decline in RAGING BULL. Training with La Motta for almost a year, Robert De Niro trained and boxed for over 1,000 rounds to add 20 pounds of muscle to his, at the time, 145-pound frame. De Niro won the Academy Award for Best Actor for RAGING BULL. Leto has been getting press for his bizarre choice of red carpet clothes, his fan cult called Echelon (he led a weekend gathering in white robes), and his fury when he heard that Warner Bros. was making a movie, JOKER with director Todd Phillips and starring Joaquin Phoenix. Leto believed he was continuing his role as the Joker. Leto is said to have tried everything he could to kill the making of JOKER. When Leto failed to stop JOKER, he dumped his CAA agents and also his music manager, who he asked to call the leader of Warners’ parent company to stop the production. I am going to take a position on the fake universes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and DC Universe Infinite. With metaverses, time travel, parallel universes, Stimulations, String Theory and heroes and villains flying faster than a jet (remember back in the day when only Superman could fly?), who can dare question a vampire made through bat blood? Are there rules – cheating gravity for one - that creators of comic book superheroes and villains must abide? If I must accept that there are 3 Spider Man’s existing in 3 different universes at the same time, how can I question Marvel’s self-created vampire,“Morbius, aka the Living Vampire, aka Dr. Michael Morbius, Ph.D., M.D.”? Freed from interfering troublesome parents as required by all superheroes, young Michael Morbius has a nice Trust Fund. He’s been living at a private clinic for kids with a rare blood disease. It’s a place to die surrounded by caring staff. Michael has been at this center so long he doesn’t bother learning much about his newly-arrived roommates. He calls all of them “Milo.” One roommate does win Morbius affection, a young boy he calls Milo. Throughout their lives, suffering from the same debilitating physical illness, their love for each other endures. Morbius has shown a fine intellectual medical mind, so he’s sent off by his kind doctor-substitute father,  Nicholas (Jared Harris), to New York to further his medical education. As his body degenerates Morbius’s brilliant mind finds a way to immortalize himself by going to a remote Costa Rica vampire bat cave. Morbius has figured out that bat blood will transform him into a healthy, robust man.  The idea that Morbius has about vampire bat blood changing humans is not so far-fetched. In 2014 the NIH approved a $3.7 million grant called  “Understanding the Risk of Bat Coronavirus Emergence.” Chinese villagers living near bat caves in Southern Yunnan province would have their blood tested for antibodies to a SARS-like coronavirus, then answer questionnaires to determine if certain behaviors had led them to be exposed.  So there is something about bats having troubling effects on humans! Let’s not forget the origin story - now a myth due to its stupidity – that a bat bit a fish that was then sold to an old Wuhan woman. I have been to many “wet markets” around the world and all manner of creatures are there side by side. I also made a habit of going to “fetish markets” all through Africa to buy animal parts. Dr. Morbius shocked the world when he declined a Nobel Prize for his research, following Russian mathematician Grigory Perelman, who in 2010 gained worldwide fame by having solved one of the world’s most intractable mathematical problems, the Poincaré conjecture. Perelman rejected a $1 million prize from the Clay Mathematics Institute in Cambridge, Mass., for the feat. Like Seth Brundle, the only reasonable trial subject is the doctor himself. He has to ask wealthy buddy Milo (Matt Smith) for the money to finance and supply a tanker to go into international waters away from the prying eyes of the medical community. The bat blood works and the transformation is astonishing. He quickly turns into a prototypical rock star/movie star with flowing hair. Good guy Batman has his “No kill rule” but Morbius has no clue that the immediate effect of bat blood was a hunger for human blood. The hired guns on the tanker supply Morbius’s first nutrition. Morbius’s transference from doctor to bat creature is terrific special effects. It’s all dazzling. Back home, Milo knows that Morbius found immortality and he is mad. Milo is not interested in the side effects and the time he would have to spend as a creature from the Island of Dr. Moreau.  While Morbius has plenty of fake blood to keep his Living Vampire Bat creature from appearing, Milo – who has the money to buy a blood bank – enjoys killing. And Morbius finds out that fake blood is hardly as satisfying as blood flowing out of a human body. The case of the gruesome deaths on the tanker is given to FBI agents (Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal) to investigate. Milo is justified in wanting his financed wonder drug but Morbius will not give it to him. The downside – killing humans – is not a topic for consideration. I side with Milo. Getting the serum himself, Milo transforms himself into a Greek god with superhuman powers strutting around New York. He becomes Morbius’s arch enemy. While Morbius’s friend Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) was helping aboard the tanker, she is saved from dying but is now a critical part of the investigation and Morbius’s secret. The Morbius and Milo pas de deux - once close friends now enemies – questions loyality, responsibility and morality. Can Morbius turn to work for the good while his challenging Vampire Bat alter-ego demands human blood? Leto is all in and delivers a strong performance and gives the Bat creature a strong identity. If the First Communion fans like a cute superhero, Morbius is the creature they will eventually turn to."
"Apr 25, 2022",NEUTRAL," Based on the Marvel comic-book character, Morbius follows Jared Leto’s Michael Morbius as he attempts to cure his rare blood disease by splicing the DNA from a vampire bat with his own – with problems ensuing after the experiment transforms Michael into a bloodthirsty vampire. Filmmaker Daniel Espinosa, armed with Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless’ screenplay, delivers a perpetually erratic thriller that fares best in its quieter, more low-key moments, as the movie’s relatively promising setup is heightened by the stirring efforts of its various performers – with Leto’s mostly charming work here matched by such compelling periphery players as Jared Harris and Matt Smith. (The latter’s unabashedly flamboyant turn as the picture’s larger-than-life villain remains an obvious highlight within the proceedings, to be sure.) It’s disappointing to note, then, that Morbius grows less and less interesting as it progresses, with the stagnant bent of the film’s midsection compounded by Espinosa’s frustrating reliance on unreasonably jittery camerawork and an egregious overuse of computer-generated special effects. (The combination of both unwelcome attributes paves the way for an action-packed climax that’s essentially and effectively incoherent.) The end result is a hit-and-miss adaptation that is, to an increasingly distressing extent, more miss than hit, which is a shame, really, given the potential afforded by the admittedly unique premise and periodic inclusion of thoroughly engaging sequences (eg a nurse is stalked within a dimly-lit hospital hallway)."
"Apr 24, 2022",POSITIVE," Morbius is the comic world’s take on the vampire legend, introducing a doctor who accidentally becomes a bloodsucker and exploring the consequences of his transformation. Comic book characters tend to have the worst luck with science experiments. If something can go wrong, it likely will – and in the worst possible way. Physical transformations, uncontrollable powers and disastrous realizations are just some of the after-effects of these trials gone wrong. On the plus side, scientists are more likely to assess their situation critically and attempt to limit the damage… versus a bystander who unwittingly enters the danger zone and suddenly has unexplainable, potentially destructive abilities. In the case of Morbius, a brilliant doctor has the noblest of intentions, but his obsession with the project leads to unintended consequences. Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) has never known a life without illness. He has a rare blood condition that makes him frail and requires constant treatment, without which he would die. As a boy, at a children’s facility under the care of Dr. Emil Nicholas (Jared Harris), Michael met Lucien, a.k.a. Milo (Matt Smith), who suffers from the same disorder, and he swore he would one day cure their ailment. Identified as a young genius, Michael becomes a world-renowned scientist, dedicating his life to hematology and finding a remedy for their debilitating disease with the aid of Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona). Unfortunately, his efforts to draw on vampire bats’ unique biology results in a serum that cures their condition, but at a price — he must now consume blood to survive, or risk turning into an overpowering, ravenous monster. This is a familiar narrative in the world of comic book heroes and villains. Michael immediately understands he’s made a terrible mistake, forced to decide if his newfound vitality and personal survival is worth the risk to everyone at large if he fails to control his blood urges. As a result, he keeps the compromised cure a secret, unwilling to inflict his curse on anyone else. However, as in many of these stories, not everyone views the cure in the same light, revelling in a life without weakness or oppression, regardless of the cost. These opposing opinions are at the centre of the film’s conflict and remain relatively grounded in a realistic-as-possible world by director Daniel Espinosa, who took a similar approach to the 2017 sci-fi picture, Life. Michael’s and Milo’s approaches to their lifestyle constraints are very different. The former has excelled professionally, becoming a rogue star in the medical world, devoting his expertise to helping children like him with compassion and care. He has hope for a better tomorrow and it shows in his interactions with his peers. Milo, on the other hand, lives like he may not see tomorrow. In spite of being wealthy, he takes unnecessary risks, becoming indebted to dangerous men, and pushes life to the limits. Fortunately, Milo’s affluence has also benefitted Michael, as he’s been somewhat of a benefactor throughout his career — no questions asked. The first half of this film is very engaging as audiences are introduced to the protagonist, learning his history, becoming familiar with his unexpectedly sympathetic personality and being in awe of his boundary-pushing medical work. Even watching him test the limits of his cured body and discover his newly acquired abilities is entertaining. And while the initial cat-and-mouse chase is exciting, particularly as the super-humans face-off against each other, it does lose its momentum relatively quickly. Moreover, Michael’s opposition to the cure and its side effects raises questions about his actions in the final act. Nonetheless, the film is very well cast. Unlike Leto’s previous foray into the superhero universe with DC’s Joker, he is much better suited to play Michael Morbius. He effectively portrays the nuances of the character’s personality, as well as his struggle first with his disease and then its cure. In spite of Smith’s everlasting connection to the quirky and loveable Eleventh Doctor, he has once again demonstrated that he’s an excellent bad boy and should definitely be considered for more villainous roles in the future. Harris’ part is limited, but he is an appropriate choice to act as a positive influence and mentor for Michael. Conversely, even though Arjona is provided a few opportunities to assert Martine’s importance to the research, it would’ve been nice if she could be positioned as more than an accessory to Michael’s work. At just under two hours, the film doesn’t feel noticeably long since in spite of its missteps, the narrative is constantly being propelled forward. There are two mid-credit scenes that tie the film into the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe, but no end credit sequence. In light of these developments, it will be interesting to see how the studio carries Morbius’ story onward after this initial introduction. COPYRIGHT © 1998 - 2023 DIGITAL JOURNAL INC.

"Apr 22, 2022",NEUTRAL," The Fantastic Beasts franchise has stumbled back into view, plagued by a myriad of behind-the-scenes issues that have become more notable than the movies, and, again, taking the story further from its origins. The Crimes of Grindelwald struggled with cohesion and juggling a multitude of narratives, and, whilst The Secrets of Dumbledore is a step up from its predecessor, it still falls foul of the same issues. Once again, Eddie Redmayne’s magizoologist Newt Scamander is forced aside in favour of the clunkily-portrayed relationship between Dumbledore (Law) and Grindelwald (Mikkelsen) and, strangely, the romance between Jacob (Folger) and Queenie (Sudol). It’s a shame as, whilst everyone here delivers a solid performance (including Katherine Waterston for all of about sixteen seconds of screentime), Redmayne provides a sense of fun and whimsy that this movie is SORELY lacking. It’s no pun or exaggeration to state that The Secrets of Dumbledore crumbles under the weight of its own self-importance and lack of magic or soul - that’s not to dismiss the movie as bad because I enjoyed a large chunk of it, but there’s a real lack of wonder throughout. Subplots of varying importance wrestle for superiority when JK Rowling, Steve Kloves, David Yates et al really needed to focus on either Newt and his fantastic beasts (which are slightly more prevalent here) or the story of Dumbledore, his strained family issues, his love for Grindelwald (which could be, you know, actually explored), and the tie-ins to the Potter saga that looms large. The movie is not without its merits, visually it’s appealing and it boasts some very decent sequences - an intriguing opening scene and a scorpion infused murder-dance spring to mind - but it feels directionless and as if it’s going through the motions towards the beckoning duel between Dumbledore and Grindelwald. Whilst not a complete bust, The Secrets of Dumbledore feels hollow and provides another janky, tonally misjudged entry into a floundering franchise - I’m not entirely sure even the Reparo spell could make a difference. The Sony/Marvelverse continues with the hugely-delayed Morbius, led by Jared Leto and the director of Child 44 and Safe House. Whilst Leto has been pushing the movie and the character for what seems like the longest time, initial hopes were not high for Morbius based on the constant delays and marketing. The first thing I must say is the studio interference with this movie is clear from simply viewing the movie - Morbius is a tonal, joyless mess. Dark and gritty can work if other aspects are working in partnership, but the uneven feeling of the movie never allowed for any balance. If anything, the sheer absurdity of the story almost called for more gonzo humour or levity to be present, though sadly certain sequences are unintentionally hilarious (Matt Smith and the slow motion vampire running…oh boy). When you factor in the bland look of the movie and the lazy script, it would seem that Morbius was a total bust. Not entirely. Is it awful? No. Is it great? Certainly not. Leto and Smith are decent in their respective roles, and whilst the tone is awry, both were committed to their performances - Leto clearly gives a damn about the character. On the flipside, Adria Arjona isn’t really given much to do which feels like a waste. The attempts at creating a legitimate horror atmosphere are admirable and not unsuccessful, however, the execution of nearly every action sequence feels heavy and uninspired. It feels like there was a really decent draft of this movie waiting to be discovered, and whilst it succeeds at times, instead, Morbius feels hollow and very much like a missed opportunity. Audrey Diwan’s Happening is without a doubt one of the toughest watches I’ve experienced in many years. Based on Annie Ernaux’s novel and set in 1960s France, the story focuses on Anne (Vartolomei), a young and gifted student who falls pregnant in an era when abortion carried the threat of jail (or worse). As her pregnancy advances, Anne must decide which path she wants her life to take and confront her fears head-on - and she is alone with her situation, unable to lean on friends and family for support. It’s a soul-crushingly difficult choice to comprehend in a time where choice simply wasn’t an option (good thing that’s in the past, right? Right…?) and Diwan delivers a heartwrenching, and, frankly, excellent depiction of the anguish and isolation, claustrophobia and pain with Happening. Make no mistake, this is a tough watch - but that’s the point, there is no glamorization to be found here, the severity of the situation is treated with harsh and unflinching respect. Confidently accompanying the story is the magnificent performance from Anamaria Vartolomei, how she portrays the varying emotions with a steely determination that constantly runs the risk of faltering is revelatory. There’s an ominous ambiance that hangs over Happening, any music is sparse and we’re left with natural commotion and the silent agony sweeping over Anne to escort us through to the agonizing denouement. Crucially, too, is the fact the Happening is less concerned with who the father is or any faux-mystery surrounding that aspect, this is Anne’s story (and the story of many women around the world) and Diwan never strays from that. Any drama that is conjured via events or the ticking-clock nature of the countdown that appears on-screen to also lend chapters to proceedings feels authentic and not in anyway manufactured or feigned. Beautifully captured by DoP Lauren Tangy, Happening is an honest, harrowing, frighteningly timely, moving, and powerful experience."

"Apr 17, 2022",POSITIVE," Jared Leto plays Dr. Michael Morbius, a doctor whose search for a cure to his blood disorder leads to some vampire-like side effects, in the Marvel-inspired “Morbius.” (Photo courtesy of Sony / Columbia Pictures.) For awhile, the comic-book action movie “Morbius” — a “Spider-Man”-adjacent character in the Sony-controlled part of the Marvel back catalog — is an interesting enough little thriller, with Jared Leto playing a determined but not-evil scientist who gets the thrills and consequences of playing God. Then, just past the hour mark, director Daniel Espinosa (who made the Jake Gyllenhaal-starring space thriller “Life”) and writers Matt Salaam and Burk Sharpless settle into the toothless series of chaotic fight sequences we all knew was coming. Leto plays the title character, Dr. Michael Morbius, a brilliant doctor and researcher, specializing in blood-borne diseases like the one that’s left him on crutches since he was a child. He thinks the breakthrough he’s seeking will come by combining the DNA of vampire bats with the human genetic code. He’s bankrolled on this by his longtime friend Lucien (Matt Smith), who’s super-rich and has the same disease — and whom Morbius calls Milo for reasons randomly explained in a flashback. He’s aided by his brilliant assistant, Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), who’s suggested as a love interest only because pickings are slim in this script. Sure enough, Morbius tries his DNA experiment on himself, and immediately he’s hale and hearty, off the crutches and sporting washboard abs. Oh, and he wants to feast on human blood, and took out a crew of mercenaries after his first transformation. He manages to hold off on further urges for red blood, thanks to a supply of artificial blood (which he invented, as the script tells us earlier). But the artificial blood’s potency is wearing off faster and faster, a couple of FBI agents (Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal) are nosing around, and Lucien/Milo eagerly wants a taste of what Morbius took. There are some cool images mixed into the standard action beats — namely, the liquid-like effect that visualizes Morbius’ bat-like echolocation. But the action sequences in the second half are frenzied and random, so much so that a viewer has to wait for characters to stop fighting just so we can see who’s winning. Odd that playing a man transforming into a vampire feels like a more lived-in, relaxed performance for Leto than his cartoonish Italian fop in “House of Gucci,” but at least he seems to be having fun with it. It’s also enjoyable to watch Smith, the former “Doctor Who” star, sink his teeth (pardon the pun) into a villain role. Of course, being something with the word “Marvel” in the credits, “Morbius” can’t be satisfied with just being its own thing. Stay through the main credits, as the MCU has trained us to do, and there’s a hint at future franchise movies to come, a beloved actor wasting his talents in armored supervillain garb, and a dull reminder that origin movies like this only exist to set up the next one. Opens Friday, April 1, in theaters everywhere. Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence, some frightening images, and brief strong language. Running time: 108 minutes."

"Apr 15, 2022",NEUTRAL," With the worldwide success of Venom and its sequel Venom: Let There Be Carnage, it was inevitable that Sony would continue to expand on their weird and whimsical take on the Marvel universe. Morbius is next up, giving audiences a 90s inspired horror actioner that delivers on its promise to be ridiculously entertaining. Jared Leto’s take on The Joker in 2016’s Suicide Squad had the unenviable task of competing with iconic interpretations of the character. Playing the Living Vampire, Leto gets the benefit of introducing a Spider-man villain that’s never been seen in live-action before. Unfortunately, his performance and most of Morbius as a whole are layered in melodrama and CGI fakery.  A sickly Michael Morbius is on a worldwide hunt to find a cure for his rare blood disease. This journey leads him to the mouth of a bat cave where he learns the inherent health benefits of combining bat blood with human DNA (no COVID subtext here, by the way). Using artificial blood that Morbius has pioneered and combining it with a healthy balance of bat blood leads to a breakthrough with…unintended consequences.  His counterpart, Dr. Bancroft (Adria Arjona) does her best to protect Morbius’ secret, even after she winds up going from an idealized Mary Sue trope to the more familiar comic book cliché of Mary Jane. Morbius and his childhood friend suffer from the same affliction, which leads to an inevitable battle when Milo (Matt Smith) becomes public frenemy number one.  Following the same formula that came before is fine, that’s what an entire movie universe has been built on. Morbius, however, seems fine with barreling towards the end without delivering on the moments in-between that make that ending worthwhile. The chemistry between Leto and Smith is effective, mirroring the relationship between Peter Parker and Norman Osborn a.k.a The Green Goblin. But Morbius cashes in on the dramatic beats of better films that came before it, from Venom to Spider-Man: Far From Home.  There are some legitimate sequences of horror that harken back to the Universal Monsters, especially in an early transformation sequence. With so much bat imagery flapping around, nods to Batman could’ve been an easy cop-out. The shape-shifting from Leto into Morbius comes straight from the werewolf mythos, looking painful and exhilarating all at once.  Surprisingly, the decision to abandon prosthetics and rely on the latest visual effects winds up being the greatest strength of Morbius. The matches in lighting and the facial mapping technology are genuinely impressive. The only problem is an overreliance on CGI. Action beats showing Morbius discover his abilities give way to incoherent blurs across the screen. Aware of its own visual messiness, the overused slow-mo effect that we’ve all seen before rears its ugly head in nonsensical ways. Slow-motion should be used to show something we wouldn’t have seen otherwise. Here, it’s just thrown in because it’s worked in other movies, so, why not?  Morbius rushes into its finale at a fevered pace, only to circumnavigate it in favor of a post-credits sequence that, apparently, Marvel fans have been waiting for. The Sinister Six now have an infinite amount of possibilities thanks to the hole that ripped open in Far From Home. Therein lies the problem. Characters like Michael Morbius don’t have room to breathe when an entire universe is at stake. It’s exactly the movie you think it is and, for that, Morbius is a welcome introduction into a world that keeps expanding even when it shouldn’t.  Morbius lives and dies by its visual effects that work, for the most part. In setting up future installments, it winds up falling victim to the inevitable sequel. "
"Apr 15, 2022",NEGATIVE,"A lot of this movie made zero sense. Trying to take elements from ""No Way Home"" and insert them in here was very misguided. This is an incredibly bad comic book film that revolves around one of the least interesting Spiderman villains. "
"Apr 15, 2022",NEGATIVE,"This was remarkably bad and somehow bored me to tears despite the insanity on-screen. The plot had more holes than swiss cheese. The character development was nonexistent. Please keep the MCU far, far away from what Sony is doing..."
"Apr 15, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Somehow, Jared Leto is not even the best Jared in Morbius. Oh, I just, enough with the origin stories we did not ask for."
"Apr 11, 2022",NEGATIVE," The age of comic book movies isn’t ending anytime soon, and it’s easy to see why people are getting sick of it. What was once an exciting time to see our favorite superheroes updated for the big screen has sadly turned into a wheezing bloat of cinematic universes and middling reboots. There are a lot of reasons why the glut of Marvel and DC movies have shifted from being good to bad, whether it be transitioning Hollywood’s focus from promoting original ideas to rehashing pre-established IPs or giving regressive and sometimes hostile fanboys too much power in a movie’s development process. But there are two specific results of the comic book movie era that are the most annoying: indifference and desperation, both blatantly on display in Morbius. Sony’s latest attempt to spin more gold from the already-thin web of the Spider-Man universe, Morbius gives the titular vampiric villain an origin story that’s somehow more bland and yet less ridiculous than the already-banal Venom. Biochemist Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) has dealt with a debilitating blood disease all his life and waves off any form of praise or connection to keep focused on finding a cure. His most promising method is combining DNA from vampire bats with human DNA, creating a serum that he injects into himself as the last test of its effectiveness. The good news is that, with the serum, he can walk without crutches, has advanced hearing skills, and shows unparalleled agility and strength. The bad news is that he needs to drink human blood to stay sane or turn into a fanged, flying monster with a thirst for carnage (no, not that Carnage). He now has to find a cure for his failed cure while protecting his colleague (Adria Arjona), his mentor (Jared Harris), and childhood friend (Matt Smith), who takes a special interest in Morbius’s work.  There have been plenty of bad comic book movies before, but Morbius shows a particularly offensive kind of laziness from Sony and the filmmakers it put in charge of making it. The closest comparison is that of the 2017 theatrical cut of Justice League, a movie robbed of nearly all elements of creativity and energy in favor of corporately mandated movie beats and franchise references strategically placed in an order that’ll keep audiences quiet for 104 minutes while their ticket money is funneled into more sequels and spinoffs. Say what you will about Justice League, but at least it used to have someone’s vision in its heart.  Director Daniel Espinosa (Life, Safe House) seems more like a director for hire as he brings little to no visual flare to Morbius and its gloomy aesthetic. Our big reveal of Morbius in monster form is just a boring camera pan up to him hanging on the ceiling with no build-up or excitement, while all of his beastly leaps onto people to drink their blood are either unseen or edited down to keep the movie PG-13 (because blood-sucking murder can be for families, too). It’s hard to put all the blame on Espinosa though, as the script by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (Power Rangers, Gods of Egypt) lift the movie’s plot points and imagery from Batman Begins and The Incredible Hulk without the character depth of the former or the goofy action of the latter. And that’s on top of dialogue so rehashed and underdeveloped, you’d think it wasn’t so much written as it was composed by an algorithm programmed to write Hollywood screenplays.  Another commonality shared between Morbius and Justice League is some blatant post-production editing. Warner Bros. and likely Sony knew their audiences would get annoyed with a half-baked movie that’s stretched past two hours, so they told their editing team to cut the films down to less than 120 minutes. And again, say what you will about Justice League (most of it is deserved, believe me), but at least it had enough material to clear the two-hour mark. At 104 minutes, Morbius very clearly had scenes cut from its theatrical run that would’ve added some much-needed dimension (or just basic explanations) to its story and characters.  The audience doesn’t know how Morbius’s friend came into extraordinary wealth as he grew up and thereby funded the biochemist’s work, nor are there any scenes that show Morbius and his colleague having prior chemistry to warrant their obligatory sexy moment in the third act. There aren’t even any scenes that show how Morbius developed a kind-hearted nature when he became an adult or him struggling to control his powers in a meaningful way.  The character of Morbius is obviously meant to be a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde duality tale, one man struggling to fight the demon trying to burst out of him. The movie Morbius has no time to show that struggle in any emotionally stirring way, because it’s got two obligatory end-credits scenes to get to because Sony is making that Sinister Six movie, dammit. Who cares if Adrian Toomes (poor Michael Keaton) is awkwardly bungled into the Morbius universe with a new Vulture suit for no good reason and talking about Spider-Man to a character who seemingly has never heard of Spider-Man before in a universe that has shown no sign of Spider-Man ever existing? Look, it’s Vulture! And Morbius! In a movie! Give us your money.  It’s very easy to make fun of Jared Leto as a personality and, occasionally, as an actor. He makes choices for the characters he plays; some of them are good, and some of them are bad. In Morbius, Leto only made one choice in front of the camera and that’s to brood. Leto left whatever charisma he has as an actor at home every day he came to set and walks into every scene of Morbius doing nothing more than pulling off the look of Gucci Jesus in some pale facial makeup. His voice never rises above the most somber octaves and his energy is created entirely by the half-decent special effects slathered on his face. At least with his spastic take on the Joker in Suicide Squad, he thrust his whole body into every movement he made.  Adria Arjona is here to be nothing more than a damsel in distress, while the most you can say about Jared Harris is that at least he still looks as good in a suit as he did playing Lane Pryce. If there is one lone bright spot in this dirge, it’s Matt Smith. The former Doctor Who brings a solid amount of deliciously evil suited energy later in the movie that you wish he and Leto would switch roles so he can embrace the theatricality of playing a monster vampire. He goes from being a smooth operator in a nightclub to a prowling monster minutes later; who wouldn’t want to see American Psycho remade in the vein of Bram Stoker’s Dracula? But that type of wild, stylistic energy would require time and care to produce, two things this movie doesn’t have. Simply put, Morbius is one of the laziest, shallowest, most pathetic attempts at a movie blockbuster in some time. It was not made to inspire the imagination of an audience or bring the fantasies of comic book fans to life, but to fill a gap Sony needs filling in order to make more money off of existing properties for years to come. There have been moments when Warner Bros. and even Marvel Studios have had projects that were statistically calculated rather than carefully crafted, but Sony has been a repeat offender. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 tried to shove the Sinister Six into the final 30 minutes of its runtime while the Venom movies have cruised by on their mere existence. Even outside of the Marvel universe, Sony is 0 for 2 in trying to make Ghostbusters relevant again. If Morbius is a sign of things to come, maybe that Dr. Strange memory spell in Spider-Man: No Way Home can be cast on the rest of Sony’s executives, so they can forget this plan and move on to something else.

"Apr 11, 2022",NEGATIVE," Debuting nearly two years after its originally scheduled release date, Morbius is the beneficiary of fortuitous timing, opening as it is in the wake of Sony’s sky-high superhero successes Venom: Let There Be Carnage and Spider-Man: No Way Home. Alas, at least some of the goodwill generated by those Marvel efforts is squandered by Daniel Espinosa’s origin story for vampiric Michael Morbius, another Spider-Man adversary who’s been reconfigured into a cursed antihero. Designed to expand the studio’s web-slinging cinematic universe, this generic monster mash adheres to such a rote formula that its every move feels lethargically mechanical. Jared Leto’s bat-man isn’t the Dark Knight, and his film definitely isn’t The Batman—although neither is it the debacle suggested by its underwhelming promos. If one thing remains true about Oscar-winner Leto, it’s that he’s rarely a safe or boring screen presence. Nonetheless, Morbius finds him eschewing the affected gimmickry he recently brought to House of Gucci and WeCrashed. Leto is Dr. Michael Morbius, a famed scientist with a rare blood disorder that requires regular transfusions. Michael doesn’t play by the rules, as evidenced by his initial decision to collect a few of the millions of dangerous vampire bats lurking in a Costa Rica cave, and his subsequent refusal to accept his Nobel prize. Of sole concern to Michael is curing himself of his fatal affliction, as well as saving those like him, be it a young girl who’s a patient at his clinic, or Milo (Matt Smith), his childhood friend and present-day financial benefactor. With sunken eyes, pale skin, and a veiny, emaciated frame, Michael resembles a skeletal specter, but his toil pays off when his experiments with mixing human and vampire-bat DNA reap astounding rewards. Because such work is ethically dubious and totally illegal, he and his colleague/eventual love interest Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) head out into international waters aboard a tanker to see if Michael’s concoction will do the trick and spare him an early grave. It does, albeit with a catch: Michael gains superhuman speed, strength, and echolocation powers, a supernatural badass who must feed on blood. Following a rampage in which he slaughters the vessel’s (not-very-nice) mercenaries, Michael runs tests on himself, and determines that his revolutionary artificial blood won’t sustain him for long; at a certain point, he’ll have to unleash his inner beast and consume “the red.” When Michael goes feral, his face transforms into a ghastly visage that, uneven CGI work aside, would have been perfectly at home in a classic Universal monster movie. On the other hand, the sight of him leaping and twisting through the air, wispy blue smoke trails in his wake while the camera segues from hyper-speed to super-slow-motion at a moment’s notice (the better to catch an extended glimpse of him in action), is right out of a modern-day Marvel venture. During his non-violent episodes, meanwhile, Michael looks like Leto doing Peter Steele cosplay, his long black hair, matching beard, and lengthy trench coat with a perpetually upturned collar—more than slightly recalling a cape—giving him the air of a fashion model with a fondness for Type O Negative-style goth metal. Written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, Morbius establishes its dramatic foundation with a minimum of fuss, as well as flair. There’s a dutiful quality to the film’s early passages, including a flashback to Michael and Milo’s youth, during which the latter is picked on by schoolyard creeps. That incident is all we get when it comes to Milo’s motivation to both crave Michael’s miracle cure—no matter the gruesome side effects—and, once he has it, to seize the opportunity to be the bully who preys upon the weak. Smith isn’t given much to work with, especially since Milo frequently can’t seem to make up his mind about whether he wants to convince Michael to embrace his bloodlust, or simply murder him for being a killjoy. Still, with a diabolical twinkle in his eye, he makes the most of his opportunities, on more than one occasion instinctively breaking into dance as an expression of joy over his newfound might. Espinosa drenches everything in inky shadows and icy hues, and though he can’t come up with an aesthetic approach that distinguishes the film from any number of vampire or Batman predecessors, his direction is as assured as it has to be, save for those sporadic instances when everything devolves into a blur of CGI noise. Certainly, Morbius is as capably helmed as both Venom affairs, and its digital mayhem is more lucid, if not quite as striking. Competence is often what Marvel enterprises value most, and in that regard, it accomplishes its modest goals. Morbius introduces Michael as a tortured soul who doesn’t want to slaughter his fellow man but might not be able to resist his urges, and pits him against a mirror-image adversary who shares his tremendous gifts and none of his pesky moral qualms. There are other characters in Morbius, such as Jared Harris’ father-figure scientist Nicholas (who raised and cared for both Michael and Milo), and Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal’s FBI agents, who assume the dutiful narrative function of pursuing Michael and, in the process, throwing up a temporary roadblock or two in his way. Yet those three figures play little part in the eventual outcome of this tale, which zips along at a fleet 104 minutes, doing its business with scant originality but just enough aptitude to register as inoffensive. Moreover, it peppers its story with the usual winks and nods to its franchise brethren, from a shot of The Daily Bugle and a subway add for Thomas & Kane (i.e. Morbius creators Roy Thomas and Gil Kane), to two mid-credit scenes involving Michael Keaton’s Adrian Toomes, aka Vulture, whose appearance would have been a bigger surprise had it not been spoiled by the project’s trailers. All the while, Leto engages in passable brooding and performs some less-than-hilarious quipping, determined to play his antihero as straight as possible. That prevents his latest from becoming a showcase for campy theatrics. It also, however, keeps Morbius from boasting anything like a pointed personality."
"Apr 11, 2022",NEGATIVE,"A case of (the filmmakers) had a character, but didnt quite know what to do with it. I think its quite a messy plot that doesnt always make that much sense A bit different with the horror theme, but nothing special. 
"
"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," After playing DC’s The Joker, Jared Leto crosses over to Marvel taking on the role of Dr. Michael Morbius, a scientist who becomes a vampire and eventually Spider-Man’s foe in the origins story from director Daniel Espinosa (“Life). The real bloodsucker may be Sony with reports of the studio meddling with the production which could explain “Morbius” being drained of all coherence. The effects-laden film with its hollow storyline ends up being filler between web-slinger releases and it makes sure you know that thanks to all the SSU references. Chameleon-like actor Jared Leto plays it straight, looking like he’s on tour with Thirty Seconds to Mars, for a refreshing performance that doesn’t require prosthetics, accents, or body transformation. He appears more as Dr. Michael Morbius than he does as CGI vampire Morbius which adheres to the scientist-monster ratio rule prevalent in superhero films. This explains why we always get a healthy dose of Dr. David Banner over his green alter ego. The origins story begins in a Greek hospital where we meet 10-year-old Michael Morbius (played by Charlie Shotwell star of the psychological thriller “John and the Hole”). He suffers from a rare debilitating blood disease as does the facility’s new patient Lucien (Joseph Esson) who Michael nicknames “Milo.” Wonderful English actor Jared Harris plays Dr. Emil Nicholas, the administrator who becomes a father figure to the boys. Two decades later we find adult Michael (Leto), now a prominent scientist, on the cusp of finding a cure while declining a Nobel Prize for his work with synthetic blood which has helped so many people including his childhood friend Milo (Matt Smith) who has become a wealthy playboy and the good doctor’s benefactor regarding an unethical mission to Costa Rica. A cave in the Central American country may hold the key to a cure, that’s the good news. On the flip side, the bad news involves Dr. M slicing his hand open thus using the blood to draw millions of vampire bats out of the cave. The overdramatic moment is prefaced by the good doctor telling his crew “If you’re gonna run, do it now” just before a gazillion bats perform a frenzied batdance around Morbius. The ridiculous but highly entertaining scene could have reached new heights had Leto belted out “This cave needs an enema!” using his Paolo Gucci voice. Meanwhile, back on a mysterious freighter sailing international waters (“Nothing to see here Coast Guard, move along) Dr. M and his assistant Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) fuse the bat DNA to concoct a serum that cures Michael yet, like all drugs, comes with killer side effects that include Abdominal pain, Abnormal liver enzymes (in infants), Abnormal rapid breathing (in infants), Constipation, Diarrhea, Drowsiness or sleepiness (in children), Dry mouth, Flatulence, and an insatiable need for HUMAN BLOOD, one-up on Nexium. Dr. Morbius is transformed into a living vampire, his body regenerated, with superpowers that include increased strength and speed, some form of bat radar, and the ability to take flight. BTW, he doesn’t fly like a typical superhero. The weird special effect resembles wingsuitting as if Morbius is floating on air while producing colorful contrails. Young daughters accompanying their dads to the movie will be entertained by the pretty colors, however, minutes later they’ll suffer from PTSD as the CGI effects transform the doctor into a grotesque, red-eyed monster with sharp fangs. The FX aren’t bad, it’s the process of transformation that’s lacking as if someone is hitting an on-off toggle switch going from human face to vampire in a millisecond. When Milo gets a hold of the bat serum he is also cured and transformed into a vampire but unlike Morbius, he has no problem feasting on humans. The two become rivals and the film transforms into an endless barrage of “Matrix”-like fight scenes as if the two former friends are channeling Neo and Agent Smith. They fight, fly, and crash into buildings, taking moments of respite to banter before resuming the unimaginative fracas. Once Milo begins killing, two Feds are brought in to investigate (Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal) only to walk around “killing” time while dropping Venom references to remind everyone, “This is a Spider-man movie!” Even Leto gets into the namedropping action as his character confronts a bunch of thuggish counterfeiters who ask, “Who are you?” to which he responds, “I’m Venom.” And by the way, with all of Milo’s money and Dr. Morbius’ knowledge and equipment, in one of the film’s biggest goofs, the vamp doctor scares off a bunch of millennials printing counterfeit $100 bills to use their equipment (which only consists of computers and wide format printers found in any UPS Store) to use as his secret lab to develop an anti-serum he can us to stop Milo. The lair resembles an old, abandoned mall. He’s probably using the space formally occupied by Piercing Pagoda. “Morbius” is just the latest example of what I call the Leto Curse. The Oscar-winning actor always gives 100% percent using method acting to transform form himself into each new character. But many of his films post-“Dallas Buyers Club” have been plagued by problems, and within each, there is a good film trying to break out. Based on the various interviews with director Daniel Espinosa, and the misleading trailers that contain scenes missing in the film, Sony’s micromanagement may be responsible for many of its problems, cohesiveness being one of them. Shortcuts are evident in every aspect of the film, from editing to special effects, to character development, and a shameless mid-credits scene involving Michael Keaton’s Adrian Toomes/ The Vulture character as another way to tie the film in with the SSU. Then there’s the PG-13 rating. If any film deserved to go full throttle with an R-rating it’s “Morbius.” The special effects which mimic the comics’ frightening semblance could have gone into Lamberto Bava mode amping up the scare component, in other words, a little more horror since we are dealing with vampires, and not the “Twilight” kind, so eighty-six those “Rainbow Bright” contrails. On a final note, I saw “Morbius” in a theater with no air conditioning (the unit went out) which meant no air circulation, and during the last 30 minutes, it was difficult to breathe, flashbacks to COVID. Yet with ample justification to walk out, the film kept me entertained enough to persevere, and that counts for something.

"Apr 10, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Superficial character development, and shady morals, means it is hard to work up much sympathy for most of the characters in this movie, including Morbius himself. Who are we intended to identify with? Who are we intended to respect or admire?"
"Apr 9, 2022",NEGATIVE,This is what we've been waiting for since 2020? Yall are proud of this? Must be some type of happy accident for Sony to finally release this on April 1st because this movie's existence is a joke.
"Apr 9, 2022",NEUTRAL," That’s not the fault of Oscar winner Jared Leto (“House of Gucci,”) who gives it his all as Dr. Michael Morbius, a brilliant man who has suffered from a blood disorder all his life. We first meet him in his quest to gather vampire bats in a jungle setting, and then we see him back at the hospital where he is dedicated to research and to saving lives. For a movie with so little to endear itself to an audience, there’s a lot going on visually, such as a cloud of something-or-other that follows Morbius when he flies around, and some slow-motion scenes. There’s also a “Matrix”-esque effect that shows how Morbius can dodge bullets. Comics fans will understand references in the extra scenes in the credits. And Marvel fans in general … well, they might want to skip this and wait for the arrival of the newest adventure of Spider-Man.  Still looking for the perfect Mother’s Day gift?

"Apr 9, 2022",NEGATIVE," While we’re waiting for the better man in the disastrous Academy Award mess to speak about the evening from his point-of-view – that would be Chris Rock, weak joke and all – I had a couple of thoughts. Thought number one. You’re Will Smith, and for the rest of your life, every time you look at the Oscar statue you received for best actor, you’re going to be reminded of your imbecilic behavior and when what should have been one of the finest nights of your life became the worst night of your life. Whew. Thought number two. The sheer egotism of a movie star – in this case Jada Pinkett Smith – in presuming that everyone, including a comedian, should know you have a disease – as unfortunate and sad as it is – that specifically generates hair loss and that’s why you’re hair is cut super short. Double whew. This brings me to average Americans who are playing upwards of $15 to see a first-run movie in theaters. And that’s in middle-America, between the coasts. Ticket prices are higher in New York City and Los Angeles. Some of the time, the $15 doesn’t buy you a seat to watch a really good film. It’s money that is not well-spent. If the pandemic doesn’t ruin the moviegoing experience, the high cost of a ticket for a lazy film and the ridiculous charges for concessions just might. “The Lost City” is a treasure-hunting effort in the vein of decades of these kinds of motion pictures, especially 1984’s “Romancing The Stone.” “Morbius” is a human vampire movie that will remind you of many cinematic vampire tales, especially 1998’s “Blade.” “The Lost City” has two directors: the brothers Adam and Aaron Nee, who have a minimal track record running a movie set. There are four screenwriters, including the Nees, Oren Uziel, and Dana Fox. There’s a story credit for Seth Gordon, who also co-produced with Liza Chasin and star Sandra Bullock. The adage about too many cooks spoiling the broth is apt here. Bullock plays a widowed recluse, who writes romantic adventure novels. The main cover model for her books is a shirtless hunk acted by Channing Tatum. Yes, male nudity abounds. Their chemistry comes across as forced. I didn’t feel enthused at the prospect that they might fall for each other romantically. There’s a central dullness at the core of the goings-on. The gist of the story over the film’s 112-minute running time is that an obsessive, eccentric billionaire named Abigail Fairfax will kidnap Bullock’s character in order to discover the whereabouts of a spectacular treasure, which is a fictional plot device in the novels, but which Fairfax believes is real. The convoluted movie then meanders hither and yon, mostly yon, which is an island in the Atlantic Ocean. Brad Pitt is involved for a while as a CIA tracker. The lumbering “the Lost City” hasn’t a whit of cleverness about which to care. Familiarity breeds contempt. One more thing. Abigail Fairfax is a man, and he’s played by Daniel Radcliffe, who gives the character everything he can, just like an energetic little bunny. Regarding “Morbius,” there’s a bit of “The Island Of Dr. Moreau” to it and a lot of everything else you’ve seen during your movie-watching lives. Young Michael Morbius has a hemoglobin disease, which is at the crux of the movie in which his younger brother Milo is also involved. The thrust of the story is filled with vampire lore. A ship’s crew is drained of its blood. Soon, a seemingly brilliant fellow becomes a warped adult and bad things are happening to good people. You’ll follow laboratory experiments, learn about synthetic blood, ponder brotherly love (and jealousy), and try to come to terms with a lust for everything vampirish, including echolocation. There’s a lot that seems made up on the fly. The central character of Morbius is part of the Spider-Man Universe, but the film has little of the clever excitement and dollops of humor that compose that specific entertainment force. In fact, an attempt to toss in some comedy fails miserably. The evil doings and essential fight come across as labored and expected for the genre. The acceptable cast, which includes Jared Leto as the adult Michael, Matt Smith as the adult Milo, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris, Al Madrigal, and Tyrese Gibson all got paid, as did Swedish-Chilean director Daniel Espinoza and American screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless. It’s not the actors’ fault that the movie feels like paint-by-the-numbers filmmaking. However, I wasn’t overly impressed with anyone’s performance. “Morbius” feels like groupthink. Movie by committee. I sensed something casual about the entire enterprise. What director Espinoza may have thought was free-wheeling and improvisatory has, in reality, generated scenes that feel unfinished. Even, perhaps, poorly considered. Without giving away anything, there’s a Biblical undercurrent regarding the relationship between Michael and Milo. The key question asked and answered in the film is whether or not Michael will embrace his vampire self. See the movie if you want to know what happens. However, fair warning. “Morbius” is a jumble, and an ill-advised jumble at that. First Amendment: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
"Apr 9, 2022",NEGATIVE," Will ‘Morbius’ go down as one of the worst Marvel-adjacent movies ever? That’s easy: Yes. But most of our ‘Morbius’ questions are harder to answer. 2. Where did Milo get all of his money? He’s evidently loaded from the moment he first appears as a child at the beginning of the film, yet even after he starts funding Dr. Morbius’s “experimental” research years later, there’s never any explanation of where all this cash is coming from. 3. Maybe I missed something, but why did Morbius turn down the Nobel Prize? Was it really because he hadn’t found a cure for his rare blood disease yet, so he wasn’t satisfied? Creating synthetic blood that would save millions of lives wasn’t good enough? 4. When Morbius and Martine are getting ready to test Morbius’s “cure” on a boat, whose idea was it to subtitle the boat’s location as “International Waters” after Morbius says they need to travel to international waters? Couldn’t we just say the location and leave it at that? 6. Why did all these hired mercenaries bring guns onto the boat, anyway? They were traveling with a pair of doctors who were conducting experiments. Were they anticipating that one of them would turn into a hyper-violent vampire? 7. According to National Geographic, a colony of 100 vampire bats can drink the blood of 25 cows in one year. That’s a lot of blood. But more importantly, that’s a lot of cow blood. No offense to the cattle of the world, but can we just get Morbius a few cows to feed on and call it a day? 8. OK, I get the thirst for blood, the echolocation abilities—all the bat-related stuff. Morbius spliced his DNA with vampire bat DNA, so now he’s got bat powers. But why is my guy so goddamned ripped now? 11. Did anyone get Pokémon vibes from Morbius? Because I, for one, did not, and I have no idea what director Daniel Espinosa is talking about when he says that it served as an inspiration for his film. 12. Why didn’t anyone question how Morbius—a world-renowned scientist who just turned down a Nobel Prize, because he’s that cool—was suddenly able to walk around without any crutches and also probably bench-press a car? 13. Between Martine in Morbius and Selina Kyle in The Batman, what do these beautiful women keep seeing in these creepy Batmen? I guess I can sort of see the mysterious appeal of Emo Robert Pattinson, and Morbius did just have the biggest Marvel glow-up since a scrawny Steve Rogers transformed into Captain America. But seriously, this isn’t a red flag? 14. When Morbius got his vampire injection, he needed help from a doctor to carefully find the point of entry on his spine before administering it. How did Milo manage to do all that by himself? 16. Who told Tyrese he wasn’t allowed to have any fun in this movie? I guess his partner (Al Madrigal) is having enough fun for the two of them, but this seems like a missed opportunity to me. 18. When Milo visits Morbius in jail, he convinces the security guards that he is Morbius’s lawyer, and then he proceeds to leave both his cane and a pack of blood in Morbius’s cell without anyone seeming to notice. Did Milo pay off the guards with his mysterious money, or are these just the worst jailers ever? 19. Is there a version of Morbius where half of the movie is just Matt Smith feeding on humans and dancing over their bodies afterward? If so, I think I’d prefer that film to the one we got. 20. After multiple victims were found dead with their blood drained from their bodies, the nickname given to the murder suspect by news outlets is … “The Vampire Killer”? If J. Jonah Jameson is good for anything, the man knows how to come up with catchy nicknames. Did Jameson keep all the good headlines to himself in another Spider-Verse, or is this version of New York City just fed up with having guys like Venom around? 21. In the Morbius trailer, Tyrese’s Simon Stroud has a bionic arm (see below), but that detail is absent in the movie. At one point, Stroud thanks Morbius for creating the synthetic blood that helped save his arm, so that might fill in some of the missing details of the story of Stroud’s arm that probably got lost in one of Morbius’s many cuts. But what’s going on here? 22. Is Morbius’s patient Anna … OK? After he has to put her into a medically induced coma early in the movie, everyone seems to forget about her. Hopefully Morbius didn’t turn her into a vampire, but the alternative is just as bleak, since he never actually found a cure that didn’t come with some pretty severe side effects. 24. At the end of the movie, why did Martine turn into a vampire when none of the other victims did? Is it because she decided to bite Morbius’s lip and drink his blood in their final goodbye, before Morbius drank her blood too? (Also, WTF?) 25. Why didn’t Morbius come back for Martine’s body after he killed Milo? Like, you’re really going to just feed on your dead girlfriend’s blood and then leave her corpse on a roof? I guess Morbius really isn’t a hero, huh? 26. What happened to Morbius’s master plan of taking the anticoagulant for himself after killing Milo? Did he have second thoughts and decide he is up for tasty human blood consumption now? 27. Let’s talk about those two stingers. The first one reveals a mysterious, purple rift in the sky, forewarning the arrival of Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton), the main villain in Tom Holland’s Spider-Man: Homecoming. After Toomes gets released from prison at the end of the scene (because his crimes were committed in another universe), the second stinger finds him meeting Morbius and proposing a team-up. First question: Why? 28. I thought the whole point of Spider-Man: No Way Home was to get villains back to their respective universes, so how did Adrian Toomes get sent to another universe? 29. Why did Toomes appear in a universe where Venom and Morbius exist, of all places? (OK, fine, I know the answer to this one—money!—but come on, is the freakin’ multiverse really that small?) 30. Why is Morbius driving to a remote location to meet with Toomes if he can fly now? Has he not seen how high gas prices are? 31. Why is Sony so enamored of the Sinister Six? A Sinister Six movie starring Andrew Garfield was once slated for release in 2016 before it got scrapped, and then it seemed as if Sony was gearing up again for a Spidey supervillain team-up when Mac Gargan (the villainous Scorpion) approached Toomes in prison in a Spider-Man: Homecoming post-credits scene. (Not to mention how No Way Home featured the Spider-Men facing off against five of their most infamous villains at once.) Is a Sinister Six movie ever going to stick, and do we really even need one at this point? 33. Does Toomes realize that his version of Spider-Man isn’t even in this universe? And if his family isn’t around in this universe either—though maybe he hasn’t noticed that yet either—then what does Toomes want? 34. What, exactly, does Morbius find “intriguing” about teaming up with Vulture? Like five minutes before the movie’s final, anticlimactic, CGI bat fight, Morbius was prepared to die so that this transformative vampire serum he brought into the world would be gone for good, and now he’s ready to team up with full-on villains? 35. How did Vulture get his armor back? It didn’t come with Toomes in the cell, and there isn’t another version of himself in this universe to borrow from either. Hell, the Avengers don’t exist in this universe, so the Battle of New York never happened and there isn’t any alien technology lying around to salvage. Where did Toomes get the materials to rebuild this thing? 38. It looks like the new Sony Spider-Verse Sinister Six will feature Vulture, Morbius, and potentially Venom. The upcoming Kraven the Hunter, starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson, likely will introduce a fourth member in its titular villain. Who would the last two members of the villainous group be, and how does Madame Web fit into everything? 41. Why didn’t Morbius question who Spider-Man is when Toomes mentioned him? A poster featuring what looked like Tobey Maguire’s Spider-Man appeared in the film’s trailer, but that shot was nowhere to be seen in Morbius. (As for Espinosa’s explanation of the poster’s omission: “If I knew something, I could tell you. [But] it’s not mine. It’s not from my idea, you know?”) One edition of The Daily Bugle also mentions that Rhino is on the loose, which is likely in reference to Paul Giamatti’s, er, unique take on the character in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. So who, exactly, is Spider-Man here?! 42. I thought Eddie Brock and his Venom symbiote/lover moved to New York City. So where is the Lethal Protector? Still honeymooning? Or are they still getting drunk with Dani Rojas from Ted Lasso? Given that Morbius ends with the titular vampire doctor teaming up with the MCU’s Vulture, this likely won’t be the last time we see Leto’s antihero appear in Sony’s Spider-Verse. Considering Sony’s strange roster of Marvel-related movies, which features Tom Hardy’s Venom franchise and the yet-to-be-released Kraven the Hunter and Madame Web (the latter of which will star Dakota Johnson and Sydney Sweeney), it isn’t clear where the studio is planning on taking this growing cinematic universe while Spider-Man remains in the MCU. But before my brain implodes with Morbius thoughts, or I slowly start to gain an urge to chug a pack of synthetic blood, I’ll leave you all with one last question: Do we really ever need to see Dr. Morbius again? Three days after its release, how’s the double album landing? And was Swift’s approach to this highly personal project successful? Nora Princiotti and Nathan Hubbard discuss on ‘Every Single Album.’ Nora and Nathan are here to dive into the album and discuss ""Fortnight,"" how Swift is grappling with her level of fame, and much more!"
"Apr 9, 2022",NEGATIVE,"If it were just a ride in a theme park, Morbius would be fun enough. But it is not."
"Apr 8, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Maybe the sequel will be better because all the introductory stuff is stuffed into this sluggish overstuffed adventure movie. Besides I thought ""Batman"" owned the rights to the use of bats."
"Apr 8, 2022",NEGATIVE," The Pitch: The first trailer for Morbius, the newest effort by Sony Pictures to hold onto the Marvel characters to which it still owns the rights, originally premiered in January 2020, in anticipation of its planned July 2020 premiere. That premiere didn’t happen for, y’know, reasons, but in the literal years since, new trailers for the film have continued to appear online and in theaters, with one of them buttoned by a reasonably funny joke: Its central character, in full monster face, growling “I… am… Venom!” at a thug, then abruptly shifting to a smile to say, “I’m just kidding! Dr. Michael Morbius, at your service.” That moment didn’t just name-drop a previous Sony/Marvel collaboration, but showcased a clever reversal on expectations, not to mention star Jared Leto doling out some very welcome charisma. Aired repeatedly over the last several months, “Dr. Michael Morbius, at your service” was a promise that Morbius wouldn’t take itself too seriously — that it might even have a little fun. Unfortunately, in the final film, when that moment arrives, it’s without the second half of the line. Whether it was cut for time or cut for tone, its absence is a microcosm of the elements which ensure that Morbius, at best, will be remembered as the latest effort on Sony’s part to make its nascent Sinister Six franchise happen. And, like “fetch,” it’s hard to see that happening. Meet the Marvel Universe’s Version of a Vampire: In Morbius, the titular individual is a brilliant doctor with a mysterious blood disease that’s led to poor health and the need to use crutches his entire life; his search for a cure leads him to the vampire bats of Costa Rica, which he collects in the film’s opening sequence and brings back to his New York lab in the hope that their ability to metabolize blood can fix his own. It’s hardly much of a spoiler to say that the good doctor is successful in his efforts, but as he discovers after administering the cure to himself, it has a lot of side effects: some good, like bat-inspired superpowers including echo location and enough wind sense to fake your way through flying. Some bad, like an all-consuming need to consume human blood. Michael’s cure is of extreme interest to his childhood best friend Milo (Matt Smith), who suffers from a similar condition, and isn’t too bothered by the downsides that come with it. A more daring film would perhaps be more engaged with the ethical questions posed by the scenario, but Morbius is too focused on getting through its paint-by-numbers origin story plotting to take the time to consider that. Instead, the plot moves quickly through Morbius getting his powers, followed by him trying to cope with them while also dealing with Milo’s lust for power. Jared Leto’s Most Grounded Performance in a Long Time: That feels like a strange thing to say about a movie where the Oscar-winning star plays a blood-guzzling super-vampire. Yet in comparison to his tWiStEd take on the Joker and whatever the hell you call what he was doing in House of Gucci, Dr. Michael Morbius feels like a nice chill guy you’d want to have a beer with. Leto doesn’t phone in his performance and the chemistry between him and fellow doctor/requisite ladyfriend Martine (Adria Arjona) is solid. But while he seems remarkably centered in who Michael Morbius is as a character, the audience is left clueless beyond flashes of genius and wit. Initially, the character’s goal is to find a cure for his disease; once he does that, though, the film is so busy motoring through the awkward plot’s chain of events that the question of what he wants now isn’t clear. Beyond taking down the bad guy, of course — and for the record, of all the film’s problems, Smith’s work is not one of them. The former Doctor and Crown star commits with relish to Milo’s circumstances, wearing his aforementioned snazzy suits (really, all of Milo’s ensembles in the film are pretty flawless). Has Smith ever given an actually bad performance? Nothing comes to mind, perhaps because it’s never happened."
"Apr 8, 2022",NEUTRAL," Sony Pictures released a teaser trailer for Morbius in January 2020 that promised a vampire superhero thriller with Spider-Man graffiti on the wall, Tyrese Gibson portraying a detective with a technologically upgraded arm, and our protagonist coming face to face with Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) from Spider-Man: Homecoming. All of this intriguing action was set to the tune of Beethoven’s “Für Elise,” which heightened the excitement of fans. Unfortunately, in the two years it took to get this film released, Morbius has broken so many of its initial promises that the final product is unrecognizable, with anything close to a creative vision replaced by studio interference that is designed to ready you for superior future films. The Marvel Cinematic Universe is generally consistent in the quality of its films and the volume of its impact. However, Sony’s Spider-Man Universe, which began with Venom in 2018, feels increasingly like a poor attempt to ride the coattails of the MCU’s success, using the characters they own to create half-baked movies you’ll see due to the hype surrounding Spider-Man: No Way Home. While the two Venom films are fun, breezy pieces of entertainment that don’t take themselves seriously. Unfortunately, much like its leading man, Morbius takes everything way too seriously, resulting in a generic, uninteresting take on the superhero genre. The film stars Jared Leto as Dr. Michael Morbius, a scientist with a rare blood disease. We learn about his disability and how he met his surrogate brother Milo Morbius (Matt Smith) through flashbacks from their childhood. Unfortunately, the flashbacks are strangely edited, with two scenes poorly cut together. As a result, there is not enough time to build a genuine friendship, with the flashbacks feeling as if they were initially longer, but much of the footage ended up on the cutting room floor. The film follows Michael as he attempts to create a cure for himself and Milo, but this ultimately leads to disastrous, predictable consequences. It’s easy to foresee the journeys of every character in this story as the film is generally free of surprises despite its best efforts. Unfortunately, once Michael undergoes the transformation and develops superhuman abilities, his goal becomes fuzzy, and the story becomes aimless and poorly paced. The thin storyline surrounding Michael’s loved ones being put in danger is overly familiar, not putting a fresh take on anything we have already seen done better. Furthermore, the screenplay from writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless is entirely uninterested in delving into its characters beyond the surface level. Leto gives a moderately compelling performance as Michael, but his character is not very interesting on the page. Smith gets to chew up the scenery and command the screen as Milo, and he is the most morally fascinating character in the film. However, Milo’s relationship with Michael and his motivation to do what he does never amounts to anything worthwhile, with a one-note conflict and a poor attempt at giving him an emotional center. Adria Arjona’s portrayal of Martine Bancroft is one of the most severely underwritten aspects of the film. She has very little to do before becoming Michael’s love interest in a scene that comes out of nowhere, given how little chemistry they shared early in the film. In addition, as mentioned earlier, the movie brings in Fast & Furious star Tyrese Gibson as Simon Stroud, a character previously advertised with a high-tech arm that Gibson championed in a 2020 Maxim interview. However, this weapons-grade arm has been entirely removed from the final film. This change removes anything potentially interesting about the one-dimensional cop character and demonstrates how much this film was mangled in postproduction. After an underwhelming final battle that feels low-stakes due to its reliance on CGI, the superhero flick dares to give us not one but two mid-credits scenes. Despite how it appeared in the trailer, Adrian Toomes has nothing to do with the entire story, only arriving at the very end for a sloppy connection to Spider-Man: No Way Home that barely makes any semblance of sense. It’s evident what Sony is trying to set up with the mid-credits scenes, but if their execution of that idea resembles anything like the product we got here, Sony’s Spider-Man Universe could be in serious trouble. Director Daniel Espinosa was clearly trying with this movie and some of that initial promise survives the changes by the studio. As with any vampire film, there are some horror elements, and these sequences are decent. There are other small highlights, such as the visual effects that surround Morbius while flying, which winds up being the most unique quality this movie has. However, the nonsensical writing and Esperanza’s failure to helm a memorable action sequence is what stops the film from being anything worth watching. Coming off the heels of superhero masterpieces such as Spider-Man: No Way Home and The Batman, Morbius is a movie you might stumble across on cable TV and play in the background as you do your household chores rather than appointment viewing. As ComingSoon’s review policy explains, a score of 4 equates to “Poor.” The negatives overweigh the positive aspects making it a struggle to get through.

"Apr 8, 2022",POSITIVE," To (badly) paraphrase and re-contextualize Leo Tolstoy, each terrible movie is terrible in its own way, but for films who've endured the dreaded postponed release-date malaise, they tend to be awful in a very similar manner. To wit, not everything in such a film is directly horrific. There might be a reasonable performance, a decent scene or two, layers implied and abandoned, something that at least allows you to see, if you squint, what might have been a conceptually better thing in pre-production -- a complaint actors often voice, with some merit, when they make a lousy flick: What was released wasn't the project for which they had signed up. Lack of Narrative Cohesion: Again, there might be some scenes that feel reasonably well worked out, especially early on, but soon enough everything falls to hell. In Daniel Espinosa's desperate Marvel buy-in ""Morbius,"" a film whose release date was changed no fewer than five times (!), we first meet Michael Morbius as a sickly young man (played here by Charlie Shotwell) with a rare blood disorder, in a Grecian sanitorium, under the care of Dr. Nikols (Jared Harris). There, he meets a new patient, whom he calls Milo (Joseph Esson), suffering with the same condition. The scene work here isn't exemplary, exactly, but working from a hacked-together script by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, it's at least competently coherent. Michael is brilliant and defiant in the face of his disease, Milo more suffering and frail. When we next meet them as adults, Michael (now played by Jared Leto) has become a Nobel Prize-winning doctor, and Milo (Matt Smith), a rich debutante, though for both of them, their disease still largely defines them. This set of affairs, in turn, leads Dr. Morbius to attempt ever-more creative and reckless experiments, trying to combine DNA strands between humans and vampire bats, which eventually leads him to try a serum upon himself, as one does, which leaves him a sort of genetic vampire, with enhanced abilities, echo-location skills, and an unslakable thirst for blood. Compare that relatively smooth transition to later in the film, where scenes are cut against one another in loose, haphazard fashion, emotional connections cease to make sense (by this point, I shouldn't need to explain just who Dr. Morbius' foe might be, but how the film chooses to get to this most obvious movement is particularly senseless), and plot elements are raised, dropped, mentioned again in different context, and never heard from again. Speaking of which ... Screamingly Significant Plotholes: A major hallmark of this beleaguered genre, many of these misbegotten movies are shot as if everyone can't wait to be finished with it, so story inconsistencies and flailing subplots are par for the course. Allow me to choose but one such glaring error, by way of example, but be aware that this sort of hopeless lack of attention to even basic physical laws applies throughout much of the film. After Dr. Morbius undergoes his transformation, he soon runs afoul of the law -- including a pair of dim FBI agents (Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal) -- and in one scene is forced to escape their clutches. Trapped on the ground floor of a hospital, Dr. Morbius looks up the extended spiraling stairwell to the large skylights some eight or more stories above him, and, using the breezes available to him (you know, at the bottom of a closed stairwell), he shoots up to the roof in a heartbeat. Gibson's brooding special agent peers up at these stairs and begins his climb. Cut to a shot immediately as Dr. Morbius emerges on the roof, where the same breezes now threaten to blow him off the ledge. He is saved in that split-second ... by the FBI agent, who somehow ascended at least eight stories of stairs in the time it takes you to read this sentence. Such ludicrousnesses are laced through this thing, as if the filmmakers couldn't be bothered to tether the film in even the most basic ways. Earlier on, as Dr. Morbius does his vital blood research, along with his fetching partner, Dr. Bancroft (Adria Arjona), off the coast of Long Island, so as to remain in international waters (not subject to U.S. laws), the pair inexplicably share their cargo ship with a group of nefarious mercenaries, armed to the teeth for reasons never explained. This does give Dr. Morbius some victims to attack when he first metamorphosizes, but makes exactly no other sort of sense. Time and again, the script has stuff happening to move the groaning plot forward, but without any other possible justification. In still another nonsensical scene later on, a young nurse walks nervously down a darkened hospital hallway. As set up, she has every reason to be anxious: The corridor is lit by single motion sensors, such that when one moves past an area the light automatically switches off. You can see why this effect would appeal to Espinosa, who tries at various times to inject his cadaver with at least some sort of spooky jolt, but as a functional hospital thoroughfare, it makes about as much sense as a jean-jacket parachute. Third-Act Failure: Largely due to both the previous problems, by the time the climax comes rushing upon us, the stakes are so scattered, the action so unsupported, that everything comes to a dull thud. What should be a veritable tidal wave of rising drama becomes little more than a weak trickle of sewage bilge spilling over your shoes. Dr. Morbius, now locked into vampiric combat against his best friend -- of the two combatants, the good doctor fares better on the CGI-enhanced monster face, for Milo, the graphic artists suck in his cheeks all the way to the bone, which makes him look like a manic David Niven on a hunger strike -- must stop Milo from utilizing his newfound powers for bloodthirsty evil. At one point, with a deadly anti-serum in hand, Dr. Morbius plans on first taking out Milo, and then himself (his own appetite for human blood is growing exponentially), but by the end, for reasons not remotely explained, he opts simply for the former, leaving himself very much intact. His job done, he whooshes out of the subterranean rubble past the crowd of cops amassed to combat him, and streaks victoriously into the sky. As a post-script, if you thought it were possible that a couple of good midcredit scenes might help smooth out some of these glaring wrinkles, you would be mistaken. Instead, we get even more lifeless, insufferably stupid addendums setting up the inevitable (?) sequel. Sony, trying to branch out in the Spider-universe on its own (this film and the two Venom films claim Marvel as a creative partner, but were produced under their own dubious auspices), has again flailed horrendously with the whole comic adaptation bit. Allowing that its animated division (creators of the absolutely brilliant Into the Spider-verse) is on an entirely separate creative department, it's pretty easy to see how off the rails the Spider-World has become under Sony's unwatchful eye. This is nothing less than an absolute fiasco, a dingy, instantly forgettable entry in the bargain-bin branch of the MCU that should be shoved back into its crypt and buried under an avalanche of bat guano.

"Apr 8, 2022",NEUTRAL," Film Ahead is a weekly column highlighting special events and repertory programming for the discerning Camberville filmgoer. It also includes capsule reviews of films that are not feature reviewed.  The Wicked Queer folk kick off Boston’s 38th LGBTQ+ Film Festival on April 7 in a hybrid format: In-person screenings take place through April 17 at The Brattle Theatre and in Boston at the Institute of Contemporary Art and Emerson’s Paramount Center; most films will be available online though the fest’s streaming portal until the end of “Gaypril.” This year includes 17 features, nine docs and a shorts programs (themed by sci-fi, Asian, Latinx and more) in which much of the material has an international flavor. Highlights include the locally shot lesbian rom-com “The Sympathy Card” (April 10, Paramount); the documentary “Being Thunder” about a genderqueer teen from the Narragansett Tribe in Rhode Island (April 16, Paramount); “Sirens,” detailing an all-girl metal band in Beirut (April 11 at The Brattle, with director Rita Baghdadi in attendance); “Three Tidy Tigers Tied a Tie Tighter,” revolving around the travails of three young folk in the dystopian future of São Paulo (April 15, Brattle); and “Being Bebe,” chronicling the ups and downs of the first winner of “RuPaul’s Drag Race” (Saturday, Paramount). There’s a small “throwback” slate of early queer classics that made mainstream inroads, “The Incredibly True Adventures of Two Girls in Love” (1992) and “I’ve Heard the Mermaids Singing” (1987) at The Brattle, on April 13 and April 16, respectively. Closing out the “The Roots of ‘Mulholland Drive’” retrospective at The Brattle tonight is the 2001 David Lynch film at the core of it all, with the film’s singer-songwriter Rebekah del Rio in attendance. The event is sold out. If that leaves you jonesing for a big-screen Lynchian spin on “The Wizard of Oz” (which “Drive” is; The Brattle played the Dorothy-and-Toto black-and-white-to-color classic last week), you have an option at the Somerville Theatre on Tuesday. On Monday the DocYard presents “Three Shorts from Morgan Quaintance,” and then it’s on to the Wicked Queer film fest for the rest of the week. This week’s “Face/Off” series flicks at the Somerville Theatre, in which we get one from John Travolta and one from Nicolas Cage, gives us “Look Who’s Talking,” the 1989 baby comedy costarring Kirstie Alley; and Cage in David Lynch’s 1990 romantic road movie homage to “The Wizard of Oz,” “Wild at Heart.” Both screen Tuesday. A “Venom”-like spin from the Marvel Universe (but not Disney’s MCU) in which we drop in on an entity who’s more villain than superhero. Jared Leto (“Blade Runner 2049”) stars as Dr. Michael Morbius, a genius who suffers from a rare blood disease that disables him more each year. In his search for a cure he invents synthetic blood, wins the Nobel, pulls a Brando (turns it down) and ultimately finds the key to his malediction – but the cure is a curse. It turns him into a “living vampire” with super speed and strength, but he needs human blood to keep going. Like that “Twilight” nonsense, he tries to be a vegan vamp, though he’s mutilated a neat dozen or so by the time he scores a conscience. His buddy (Matt Smith, “Last Night in Soho”), ailing from the same disease, takes the serum too and is more than happy to munch on humans every day and all the time. From there “Morbius” becomes pat and predictable, with so-so FX that look like something from an “Underworld” flick from two decades ago. Leto’s magnetic, but the narrative stitching is frail and doesn’t have enough meat for the actor to bite into. Hold tight during the end credits: There’s a tease – or two – of what’s to come involving another A-list actor caught up in the bloodless nonsense.

Nani Li Yang’s drama centering on Ai-Jia (Kathy Wu), a struggling writer in Los Angeles who supports herself as a tour guide for Chinese visitors, may not be a gonzo rush like the latest from the Daniels, but at its core it is about family, culture and generational clashes. The rub comes when Ma (Ah-Lei Gua) says she’s coming to L.A. with Ai-Jia’s teenage niece and nephew because their father and mother have gone to jail – the result of a corruption scandal. Ma’s not a fan of Ai-Jia’s American boyfriend (a generic Travis Goodman) and decides to play matchmaker. More heartfelt are the hardships facing the transplanted teens at school: Zheng-Qi (Demi Ke), a slightly rebellious goth, draws the attention of the popular boy as well as an introvert with troubles at home, while Zheng-Yu (Jiayu Wang) struggles with his sexual identity at school and under his grandmother’s scornful eye. The performance by the ensemble is affecting. The film has some nice moments of realization and occasional cross-cultural comedy; it’s something of a reverse-direction version of Lulu Wang’s 2019 “The Farewell.” On Amazon Prime Video.  Nothing’s worse than a laborious comedy seeking a laugh you’re not feeling. That’s the case here with this slack Covid-lockdown tale about a film crew making the sixth or seventh sequel in a franchise known as “Cliff Beasts” about dino-raptor-avians who munch on people, much the same way those things got at Meryl Streep’s self-centered POTUS at the end of “Don’t Look Up.” The film centers on a married couple (Leslie Mann and David Duchovny) who are the stars of the series, with Fred Armisen as the indie auteur who won Sundance with a film shot on his iPhone, now frustrated with a big budget, meddling producers (Kate McKinnon and Peter Serafinowicz) and big egos. It’s therapeutic to look at the process of maskless actors with a masked crew on the other side of the lens, reminiscent of the set shots making the rounds when “Don’t Look Up” was made here mid-pandemic, and fun to drink in the green screen, CGI, behind-the-scenes magic and shenanigans. The film’s helmed by Judd Apatow (Mann’s husband), who’s scored better on the funny bone tickle meter with fare such as “The Forty Year Old Virgin” (2005) and “Knocked Up” (2007). This concept doesn’t quite rise to the promise of its deconstructive premise. On Netflix. Tom Meek is a writer living in Cambridge.

"Apr 8, 2022",POSITIVE,"Is it a movie you should see? Honestly, yes."
"Apr 8, 2022",NEGATIVE," Morbius, in theaters, is the latest installment in Sony’s quixotic attempt to create a shared cinematic universe of Spider-Man-adjacent characters without Spider-Man. But this movie’s so awful, everyone’s favorite webslinger might not have been able to save it. Jared Leto plays Michael Morbius, a brilliant doctor who’s saved millions of lives and achieved wealth and fame with his invention of artificial blood. But all his accomplishments are just a byproduct of his real goal: He’s spent his life trying to cure himself of a debilitating blood disorder. Time is running out for Michael and his friend Milo (Matt Smith), who suffers from the same rare genetic condition.  Michael, with the help of his love interest, Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), fuses his DNA with the DNA of a vampire bat, turning himself into a chimera. Things go terribly wrong—and by “things” I mostly mean the script. Morbius—rated PG-13 for frightening scenes and brief language—begins as a classic tale of a doctor playing God and violating ethical standards in the name of science. Michael turns himself into a vampire who must consume human blood to survive—no one ever explains why it must be human blood, just one of many plot holes. These kinds of movies are supposed to be morality tales in which the protagonist comes to a tragic end. But a tragic end can’t become a franchise, so Morbius flinches from its necessary conclusion, leaving an already confused movie without a payoff. In the comics, Spider-Man is the hero, and Morbius is the villain. Without Spider-Man, this movie tries to make Michael the hero, even though he kills a bunch of people after becoming a vampire. There’s an unsuccessful attempt to make these casualties of the scientific method seem like they might have deserved it. Michael’s heroism never rings true, and Leto’s portrayal of Michael is understated to the point of being lifeless. When he’s not voicing hackneyed dialogue in dull tones, he stares impassively. Michael is a genius who creates DNA splicing equipment from junk—that scene might be more ridiculous than the fact that his teeth change shape—but he’s also egotistical and unlikable. To make Michael seem remotely heroic, Morbius turns Milo into a vampire who plans to eat everyone. There isn’t any narrative explanation for Milo’s bloodthirstiness other than the film desperately needed someone more wicked than its hero. Sometimes special effects and action sequences can make up for a bad script, but that’s not the case with Morbius. The movie contains a couple of well-executed sequences that pay homage to the suspense genre, but most of the effects are lackluster and incoherent. Action sequences are so full of echolocation visualizations that the audience can barely see what’s happening. That might be for the best. The finale is both nonsensical and anticlimactic. In a couple of mid-credit scenes, Sony promises a follow-up movie. If this franchise is ever going to be successful, it’s definitely going to need a revamp. Collin is WORLD’s arts and culture editor.

"Apr 8, 2022",POSITIVE," That may not be something that’s easy to admit, but this critically panned Marvel movie from director Daniel Espinosa doesn’t really deserve all the hate it’s getting. It’s not a stellar (or even one of the better) comic book cinematic entries, but I found the origin story of a biochemist turned vampire to be entertaining, warts and all. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) has a rare blood disorder and devotes his life to finding a cure for others who are also suffering from the disease. After early animal tests show promise, the doctor decides he will be the first human to give his new experimental treatment — which involves injecting himself with blood from bats — a trial run. It works, but has horrific side effects as Morbius develops a thirst for blood. It’s a solid vampire movie that’s oddly satisfying, even though it feels like there are chunks of story missing. The editing is a mess, and the effects aren’t much better. There’s nothing about the film that’s special or memorable. It’s extraordinarily generic. The film’s best element is its lead actor. Leto seems right at home in a role that feels tailor-made for him, if not a character he was born to play. He’s just as strange as his alter ego, and it’s a fully realized and wholly committed performance from the actor. It’s a complex character even if the film doesn’t feel that way, especially as Morbius tries to weigh his desire to do good with his need to feed. He’s the type of antihero that you want to root for. The film doesn’t deliver a lot of high notes, but it’s not unwatchable (especially if you enjoy the vampire genre). “Morbius” is not as great as you’d hoped, but not as bad as you feared."
"Apr 8, 2022",NEGATIVE," A long time ago, I wrote about Superman IV: The Quest for Peace for our 1987 Week series, examining the good, the bad, and the ugly of that particular year in film as represented in equal proportion. For lovers of true low-down schlock cinema, ’87 holds particular significance: It was the year that the Cannon Group — the home of nutcase producers Menaheim Golan and Yoran Globus and owner of goofy masterpieces like The Apple, Lifeforce, and The Delta Force — began to truly collapse, with the one-two punch of Superman and the Dolph Lundgren Masters of the Universe not helping financial matters. Of course, they’d still have Albert Pyun’s Cyborg to release a few years later, but they were pretty much done for, given that the brightest stars can only shine for so long before they fade away and/or burn out. Their legacy lives on in a number of ways, but perhaps the most obvious among the bunch is in the Sony Universe of Marvel Characters, and not simply because both owned the rights to Spider-Man at one point. They make knowingly ridiculous and ballsy films as a way to separate themselves from their competition, scouring the bottom of the barrel for licensable characters and/or interesting ideas for movies. The Venom films feel like they could have been Cannon releases, especially Let There Be Carnage, and, as such, so does Daniel Espinosa’s Morbius.  The difference is that the Venom films are well-constructed and thought-through exercises in Goofball Cinema, hinging upon an unpredictable and perpetually funny performance from Tom Hardy as well as a hefty amount of queer subtext, while Morbius is slap-dash and chaotic, centered around Jared Leto, he of “Why the hell is he in this?” fame, and undoubtedly Frankensteined together from a hefty amount of reshoots. It unintentionally reaches the same conclusion as its predecessors did, which is to say that it’s an incredibly fun time at the movies, but good lord, is it a once-in-a-calendar-year mess, the kind of catastrophic failure that someone will eventually make a podcast about. There’s a reason that this movie has been punted throughout the pandemic release calendar like a football in a game in which both teams are perpetually going three-and-out at their own twenty, and it wasn’t just because Sony wanted to maximize their profits: it was because they were going to get a single decent weekend out of it before word-of-mouth smacked into this thing like it’d just made a joke about G.I. Jane 2.  Anyway, Morbius tells the tale of C-list Spider-Man antihero Dr. Michael Morbius (Leto), who was born with a rare genetic disorder that causes his body to collapse if he doesn’t have his blood cleaned and recirculated every few hours. After (accidentally) inventing artificial blood and subsequently rejecting the Nobel Prize, Morbius sets his sights on finally conquering the ailment that has left him crutch-bound by genetically merging the DNA of a human and a vampire bat. He is, of course, the first human subject, and the experiment works — he’s “cured” of his disease and is given some pretty crazy superpowers (he’s big and fast and can kind of fly if he balances on currents just right) but he also has an unquenchable thirst for blood, and becomes a bat-like creature when he starts to get the hunger. If he doesn’t pop open a couple of human bottles of Red Wine (or its weaker artificial equivalent) every few hours, he’ll turn back into his sickly self. Even worse, his best bud, Milo (Matt Smith), a rich psychopath still tended to by Morbius’s mentor (Jared Harris), has taken the formula as well, and is way more fun about the whole thing, killing clubgoers who make him mad and newspaper vendors who just so happen to say the wrong things about his pal. And, of course, Morbius is getting blamed for all of them.  Essentially, Morbius is a feature-length shitpost, with dozens upon dozens of individual moments ripe and ready for internet film communities to dig through and add to their forum or server lore. It’s about as cogent as trying to make a feature film of your Reddit front page on a particular day and equally as memorable. It’s catnip for dumbass film bros looking to go Tom Servo on a “bad” movie for the benefit of their date (and lord help her if that’s the case – hopefully, he’s either packin’ or got a lot of money if he’s gonna talk through this piece of shit while laughing at his own jokes) and will likely alienate and frustrate anybody just trying to do something fun on a Friday night without hearing a chorus of nerd laughter echoing throughout the theater. But for those who truly love themselves some garbage cinema — the same kind of connoisseur who happily bought individual Blus of Quest for Peace and MotU at full price — this is opening night viewing, provided you don’t have a shitty audience. God help you, because you’ll have an amazing time at the cost of your very soul."
"Apr 7, 2022",NEUTRAL," There’s nothing like seeing the Marvel logo come up on the screen when the lights dim in a cinema. But don’t expect Morbius to be an MCU movie. Starring Jared Leto in the titular role as a dedicated genetics doctor who is hellbent on finding a cure for his rare blood disease, it’s a tense and eerie look at vampire origins through a sci-fi lens. It sways towards horror and its darker tone turns the spotlight on an underrated comic book anti-hero. But it’s less refined than what we’re used to in the superhero genre and the script comes across as disjointed. The disconnect between the trailer and the final cut is questionable and virtually an extreme form of clickbait; the ‘easter eggs’ are ultimately empty promises. There’s even an argument to be made that the rating constricts its potential. With a morally ambiguous protagonist, boundaries have to be pushed and it doesn’t help that technically Morbius looks like it was made in the early 2000s. Despite this though, Leto and Matt Smith – who plays Morbius’ childhood friend Milo – keep you engaged alongside Adria Arjona and Jared Harris. Leto is haunting as Morbius and it’s a portrayal unlikely to have been matched by another actor. Milo is a new kind of role for Smith, and one which he embodies well. The scenes between him and Harris are particularly intense. Arjona’s character Dr Martine Bancroft is also a great asset; she’s well-rounded and it’s clear great care was taken when characterising her. It’s satisfying to see her hold her own and challenge Morbius, while also maintaining their thrilling chemistry. The cast performances are therefore on the positive side, which bodes well as the film is largely a character study. Overall, this is an entertaining movie. It sucks you in with the action and standout scenes between some of the characters. But, while Morbius has the makings of a great anti-hero revival, it wavers with the execution. Morbius is launching exclusively at cinemas on 1 April 2022. Read our interview with Daniel Espinosa, Matt Smith and Adria Arjona here.

"Apr 7, 2022",NEUTRAL," Biographical drama starring Renée Zellweger. In the late 1960s, Judy Garland attempts to revive her waning career by accepting an offer to perform a series of musical revues in London. Unfortunately, her years of poor treatment, ill health and substance addiction have taken their toll and an exhausted Judy proves to be increasingly unreliable and self-destructive. Renée Zellweger gives a tour-de-force performance as Hollywood legend Judy Garland in this knockout triumph geared around the star's notorious engagement at London's Talk of the Town nightclub, just six months before her tragic death in 1969. Jessie Buckley plays no-nonsense production assistant Rosalyn Wilder, who is assigned to keep Garland off the pills and booze as she battles for custody of her children and marries a fifth unsuitable husband, slippery Mickey Deans (Finn Wittrock). With flashbacks to Garland's experiences making The Wizard of Oz and Babes in Arms (revealed as the root of all her personal and health problems), and a very moving sidebar into her devoted gay following, Judy often makes for gut-wrenching viewing, but is also too gripping to turn away from. Zellweger sings the classic Garland songbook with such astounding accuracy there won't be a dry eye in the house come the sensational Over the Rainbow finale."

"Apr 7, 2022",NEGATIVE," One of the most compelling and conflicted characters in Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters comes to the big screen as Oscar® winner Jared Leto transforms into the enigmatic antihero Michael Morbius. Dangerously ill with a rare blood disorder and determined to save others suffering his same fate, Dr. Morbius attempts a desperate gamble. While at first it seems to be a radical success, a darkness inside him is unleashed. Will good override evil – or will Morbius succumb to his mysterious new urges? Jared Leto’s shoulders must be tired because he carried this movie as best he could. His performance as Dr. Michael Morbius was convincing and engaging. It was refreshing to see him go from his normal appearance to the more vampiric version of the character. Leto also had solid on-screen chemistry with his co-star Matt Smith. The latter did the best that he could with the script he was given. Smith’s delivery in the role of “Milo” was a suitable complement for Leto. The visual effects for Morbius were captivating to a degree. The action choreography was fun to watch and keeps audiences’ attention for the most part. The timing with the slow-motion was done nicely to give to the audience a chance to actually keep up with the fast-paced action. The worst thing about Morbius has to be the overall direction of the film. The visuals were nice initially with Morbius having the colorful cloud effect whenever he would use his abilities. However, over time, those same visuals became overused and nonsensical. At first, it would seem as though the effects were tied to Morbius’ abilities, but soon it was just there for the sake of having something shiny on screen. As a result, the decision to have those visuals made the film feel unnecessarily animated and corny. Next up, the writing was simply lackluster. Morbius had a pretty straightforward storyline without any real twists or turns that would surprise audiences. There is a twist, but it’s mild at best, and even when that is discovered, it feels rushed. Namely, the motivation of the main antagonist felt underdeveloped. If that wasn’t bad enough, it was disappointing to see Morbius use the same “mirror villain” trope. With both characters doing similar things, it’s just a missed opportunity to make Morbius‘ ascension more intriguing. Another issue would be in the abilities Morbius exhibited. The super-speed and radar senses were nice to see, but there were other abilities that felt like a stretch of the imagination. His version of a popular Dragon Ball Z move was probably the most ridiculous thing I’ve seen in a comic book to date. I understand why it was there for the sake of visuals, but for the sake of the story, it just didn’t come across effectively. Not only that, but his other abilities didn’t seem to make much sense either. For whatever reason, Morbius seemed to always have an advantage with his abilities that his counterpart lacked. That never felt like an authentic development in the character but rather a passive function of a plot device. Morbius is an incoherent and unoriginal film that doesn’t make the best use of Jared Leto’s talents. I’m surprised this movie was released in the way that it was because it didn’t seem indicative of the director’s talent at all. I wouldn’t say that Moribus is the worst comic book movie at all. It still had some baseline entertaining elements that some fans may enjoy as long as they don’t care about the messy writing. There are enough shiny things with visual effects to keep people’s attention away from the nonsensical moments in the film. If you enjoyed Venom 2, then Morbius easily tops that, even though that is certainly not a high bar. I can’t say there’s much to look forward to in rewatching Morbius. Even the post-credit scenes are terrible because they don’t add up or follow the Spider-Man: No Way Home connections the film was seeking to continue. Feel free to watch Morbius at your own risk. Director:  Daniel Espinosa Writer(s):Matt Sazama & Burk Sharpless Stars: Jared Leto, Matt Smith, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris, Al Madrigal, Tyrese Gibson Morbius will be in theaters Friday, April 1, 2022.

"Apr 7, 2022",NEGATIVE," *** A hyperkinetic sci-fi/martial-arts (kung fusion?) fever dream grounded in Asian American family dynamics, Everything Everywhere All at Once will be absolutely adored by some moviegoers from its very first moments. It’s a film made to be loved—and, given the sheer eye-popping technical wizardry at play throughout, nearly impossible to hate. Michelle Yeoh is typically dazzling as Evelyn Wong, a misanthropic laundromat owner who is called upon to save the multiverse from her daughter’s worst self (Stephanie Hsu, in a role intended for Awkwafina). Evelyn is an underwritten character, but Yeoh brings a welcome authenticity to the film, even if a performance of such finely shaded nuance isn’t best fit for the DayGlo sensationalism of Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, the filmmaking duo known as Daniels (Swiss Army Man). As with Terry Gilliam or Edgar Wright or any other avant-garde sentimentalist pressing restless rhythms and visual inventiveness into the service of a wholly undeserving story, the directors effortlessly pep up the slow parts and paper over the plot holes, but when the pace calms and the fireworks die down for an emotional climax, the film moves glacially. Inevitable? Perhaps, but it’s still disappointing that Everything Everywhere All at Once is less than the sum of its dazzling parts. R. JAY HORTON. Bridgeport, Cinema 21, Clackamas, Eastport, Evergreen Parkway, Hollywood, Laurelhurst, Lloyd Center. **** After you see the Best International Feature Oscar-winning Drive My Car, you will never look at snow, suspension bridges or stages the same way again. When you see the world through the searching eyes of director Ryûsuke Hamaguchi, there is no such thing as mere scenery. There is only the living fabric of the places and objects that envelop Yûsuke (Hidetoshi Nishijima) and Misaki (Tôko Miura), whose compassion and complexity are a world unto themselves. Most of the film is set in Hiroshima, where Yûsuke is directing a production of Chekhov’s Uncle Vanya. Misaki is assigned to be his driver, but their relationship transcends the divide between the front seat and the back. During drives, conversations, and surreal yet strangely believable adventures, their reserve gradually erodes as they reveal their losses and their inner lives to each other, building to a cathartic climax that leaves you at once shattered and soaring. The film, based on a novella by Haruki Murakami, isn’t afraid to face the agony of grief and loneliness, but Hamaguchi’s obvious love for his characters suffuses the entire journey with life-giving warmth. A tender, hopeful coda set during the pandemic could have been cringeworthy, but like every moment of the movie, it’s worth believing in because Hamaguchi’s sincerity is beyond question. “We must keep on living,” Yûsuke tells Misaki. With those words, he speaks not only to her but to us. NR. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON. HBO Max. *** Near the climax of CODA, which won Best Picture at this year’s Academy Awards, audiences experience a much-foreshadowed concert from the perspective of a singer’s deaf family. It’s not just sound’s absence that seals the Apple TV+ film’s best scene; it’s how the camera registers Frank and Jackie Rossi gauging the crowd’s reaction to their daughter Ruby (Emilia Jones) belting. That’s the moment you know why CODA (which stands for child of deaf adults) won Sundance’s Grand Jury Prize and why, despite playing on a clear inspirational formula and remaking a 2014 French film, it’s a smart and heartfelt portrayal of deafness in mainstream American movies. For one, there’s Ruby’s complex role as the only hearing member and de facto translator for her gruff yet charming New England fishing family. Playing her parents and brother, deaf actors Marlee Matlin (Oscar winner from Children of a Lesser God), Troy Kotsur (a newly minted Oscar winner) and Daniel Durant are grounded and multidimensional, signing with Ruby in rage, mockery, hubris and shame. While some of the supporting performances pale—Ruby’s fastidious choir teacher is more irritating than aspirational and her love interest is a classic doesn’t-deserve-her wet blanket—just try not to be moved by this loving, needy, overwhelmed and surprisingly horny family confronting change. The formula works for a reason. PG-13. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Apple TV+, Bridgeport, Cedar Hills, City Center, Clackamas, Fox Tower, Laurelhurst, Oak Grove. *** Though it relies on premise more than plot, The Lost City stands tall among its rival predators in the catalog of action comedies. The story begins with author Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) reluctantly going through the motions of a press tour for her latest romantic adventure novel in which she’s forced to work with the book’s cover model, Alan (Channing Tatum), whose earnest portrayal of her leading man “Dash” puts them instantly at odds. Loretta is then kidnapped by an eccentric billionaire (Daniel Radcliffe) who believes she holds the key to finding the lost treasure featured in her novel. From there the film becomes much less about story and more about the comedic chemistry between Tatum, Bullock and the hilarious supporting cast. Brad Pitt provides the type of scene-stealing punch that’s made him one of the best bit players we’ve ever seen, and the fact that the story doesn’t get mired in the friction between Loretta and Alan lends an authenticity to the chemistry that anchors the film. Even though the story falls apart in the third act, the characters build enough goodwill it doesn’t matter. The Lost City is a film designed simply to entertain—and it succeeds. PG-13. RAY GILL JR.

It’s a blood-steeped farmer’s grandmother yarn about a van full of overripe, reflective, Linklaterian Texas stoners renting a ramshackle cabin from a decrepit couple for an amateur hardcore shoot. An undersexed harpie and long-suffering codger might not seem especially terrifying on paper, but West expertly teases, say, the looming specter of Chekhov’s Alligator just long enough for audiences to walk straight into the business end of a rusted pitchfork. If anything, the technical facility and lockstep set pieces can feel too perfectly composed. Given the sheer amount of gore on display, there’s an odd sense of restraint tempering the anarchic abandon that burbles throughout the classics of the genre. Halfhearted attempts at providing a psychological basis for the elderly couple’s homicidal mania weaken the lingering air of menace as swiftly an acoustic Fleetwood Mac cover kills any sexual tension. Like a cameraman/budding-indie-auteur character pointedly claims, every dirty (or scary) movie may as well strive for greatness. R. JAY HORTON. Cedar Hills, City Center, Clackamas, Eastport, Evergreen Parkway, Fox Tower, Hollywood, Laurelhurst, Living Room, Lloyd Center, Studio One, Tigard. ** “What’s black and blue and dead all over?” In The Batman, the Riddler (Paul Dano) poses that question to the Dark Knight (Robert Pattinson), but blacks and blues don’t figure into the film much—visually, morally and emotionally, it’s a gray movie. While director Matt Reeves brought a majestic mournfulness to the Planet of the Apes series, he seems utterly lost in Gotham City. His nearly three-hour film is less a narrative than a mechanistic survey of a political conspiracy that the Riddler wants to expose—the story starts after the murder of Bruce Wayne’s parents not just because we’ve seen it before, but because Reeves is more interested in plot than pathos. Even the soulful, sultry presence of Zoë Kravitz as Catwoman can’t liven up the film—she and the Batman flirt so chastely that if it weren’t for a few F-bombs and clumsily staged fight scenes, Reeves could have easily gotten away with a G rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. When Christopher Nolan was directing the Dark Knight trilogy, he tore into the Batman mythos with fervor, whereas Reeves just seems to be lackadaisically marinating in misery—especially when the film attempts an embarrassingly halfhearted critique of Bruce and the rest of Gotham’s 1%. What’s dead all over? The Batman. PG-13. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

Yet in Morbius, he’s something he’s never been before: disastrously dull. It may sound improbable that the man who bragged about sending used condoms to his Suicide Squad castmates could be boring, but as scientist-turned-vampire Dr. Michael Morbius, he’s more zombie than bloodsucker. Originally a second-tier Spider-Man adversary, Morbius has been drafted for Sony’s second attempt at a supervillain franchise, following Tom Hardy’s Venom series. Those movies are trash, but at least Hardy attacks them with gonzo fervor—he dived into a tank of lobsters to earn his paycheck. Leto, on the other hand, just gazes glumly from under the shadow of a dark hoodie, meekly surrendering the spotlight to Matt Smith (Doctor Who), who co-stars as a nastily charismatic fellow vampire named Milo. Smith understands that vampirism should be suave and sensual—in one scene, he dances seductively while donning a suit, doing an apparent homage to Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man 3 (that’s a compliment, by the way!). In a Jared Leto movie, Smith is the only one giving a Jared Leto-style performance. He’s goofy and hammy and weird, but at least he’s memorable. That’s more than you can say about the other actors in Morbius, including its newly languorous leading man. PG-13. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

"Apr 7, 2022",NEGATIVE,"A mishmash of shoddy-looking effects work and oddball creative choices, a mélange of nonsense that could have been somewhat forgiven if the movie was any fun ... but it isn't. In short, Morbius kind of sucks."
"Apr 7, 2022",NEGATIVE," 
There are dark and brooding superheroes, and then there's Morbius the Living Vampire. Originally created in 1971, he was one of Marvel's first horror characters after the Comics Code Authority started to relax its rules on more eerie content. Those edicts had been put in place to push 1950s horror publishers out of business, and when Marvel had the opportunity to bring back those more terrifying aspects they still wanted to merge them with their existing crop of superheroes. Thus, Morbius, one of Spider-Man's allies and a sporadic member of his rogues' gallery. After all, it's a little hard to be the good guy if you happen to be prone to a raging, murderous bloodlust.
 
Significantly, Morbius' vampirism was due (as was often the way with Spidey's foes) to scientific hubris, and that's another aspect of the character carried over into Morbius, his first movie outing. Michael Morbius (Leto) has a rare blood disorder, but as a supergenius researcher he's hunting for a cure that would help people like him, including his childhood fried, Milo (Smith). Unfortunately, this cure involves injecting himself with vampire bat DNA: Side effects may include flight, superstrength, superhearing, echolocation, and the occasional killing spree.
 
Morbius continues Sony's trepidatious attempts to turn their Spider-Man films into an extensive franchise, mostly by building out his villains in stand-alone movies. We've had two Venom flicks, both succesful in spite of themselves, and the prospect of Leto as a charismatic bloodsucker seems to set Morbius up for similar success. However, like Venom, it will be more through momentum than actually taking advantage of what could be done here.
 
Watching Morbius isn't about watching a bad film, or even a boring one. It just feels consistently incomplete. The script by Burk Sharpless and Matt Sazama has all the flaws of their earlier muted blockbusters like Dracula Untold and Gods of Egypt: expositional, bland, designed to move the story along with no flourishes. It's like director Daniel Espinosa (responsible for the oddly underrated alien horror Life) took their first draft and just filmed that, with all the punch-up and vague plotting that gets fixed in rewrites left undone. If that's what happened, it would not be the worst decision Espinosa makes here. So many choices, from longtime collaborator Jon Ekstrand's clashing keyboard-and-strings score to individual shot compositions to the way Morbius leaves a trail of misty vampire dandruff floating in the air, just seem halfhearted. They're not terrible, but they're also not interesting.
 
That may be what's most frustrating about Morbius, that there's clearly a better film lurking under the surface. After all, this is Leto and Smith, two of the most curiously charismatic actors of their generation. Yes, while it is de rigueur to castigate Leto, he seems constitutionally incapable of making a boring decision (cf him being the most interesting part of the cartoonish House of Gucci); so even though Morbius is rarely given a line that does anything more than move the plot from A to B, he still tweaks some moments of levity and weight out of them. His earliest scenes with Smith are surprisingly tender, imbued with the details that make their supposed lifelong friendship plausible. If only there was more of that, then Morbius could be the film it wants to be. But there's not.
 
So it's not that Morbius degrades into a CGI-powered slugfest, followed by the mandatory mid-credit sequences that imply long-term connections to the bigger Spider-Man cinematic realm (spinoffs and team-ups and sequels, oh my!). Getting upset at those is like getting upset at third acts. They're just part of modern superhero storytelling. It's that Morbius does what it's supposed to, nothing more, and barely that. If only this living vampire had more of a pulse.

"Apr 7, 2022",NEUTRAL," Thanks to that litigious supervillain known as Rights Issues, Morbius isn't part of Disney's Marvel universe, with its Iron Men and Black Widows whom we know so well. The effects of the Watergate scandal were still playing out when Alan J. Pakula made this masterful political thriller, in which Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman are outshone only by Jason Robards, who won an Oscar as Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee. The film starts off by showing the very human doctor, supporting himself on two crutches, being helicoptered into the jungle to investigate a cave full of vampire bats. We then learn that he's being bankrolled by his childhood buddy, Milo (Matt Smith), to find a cure for their shared, unspecified condition — by whatever means necessary.  I'd gone into Morbius expecting a throwaway comicbook movie, but the director Daniel Espinosa and writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless seem to have higher aspirations. It helps, as well, that the relationship between Morbius and Milo is so oddly Romantic, with a capital R, in the sense of opium-addled, 19th-century poets trying to wring meaning out of the cosmos.  Smith had been doing a fine job casting shadows with just his quiff and cheekbones, but then his performance is literally covered up with a prosthetic mask.   It all ends with a daft punch-up between Morbius and Milo, who both, of course, have super-strength, super-senses, fly around, and ... all the usual.  Morbius promised to be different, it starts off different, and, for a minute or two, it even made me watch a Leto performance without wincing.  There are resounding echoes of Sydney Pollack's 1969 dance-marathon drama They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, in German director Bastian Gunther's melancholy but compelling film One Of These Days (15, 119 mins).  A fancy truck is the prize for the person who keeps his or her hands on the vehicle for the longest time, with occasional hour-long 'comfort breaks' allowed, but no proper sleep. Joe Cole, now playing a very English spy in ITV's The Ipcress File, shows his versatility with a tremendously credible performance as a sleepy-eyed, blue-­collar local, desperate to win the truck to improve the life of his young family.  Ruth Wilson plays a benefits office employee in Ramsgate, increasingly in thrall to a charismatic man (Tom Burke) just released from a short jail term, whose claim she is dealing with.  He seems almost to sniff her low self-esteem and a toxic relationship develops to the detriment of her job, her friendships, and her health. It feels all too real. Phil Grabsky's sumptuous documentary Easter In Art (PG, 86 mins) does what it says on the tin, vividly telling the story of the Resurrection by looking at centuries of remarkable paintings and sculpture, from Michelangelo to Munch.  Anyway, here we are again with a predictably daft story that at least begins in inspired fashion, with Sonic's nemesis Dr Robotnik (an off-the-leash Jim Carrey, pictured, comfortably the film's greatest asset) marooned on a planet made of mushrooms, from which he escapes so he can get even with our hero in Montana. He also intends to get his evil hands on an enchanted gemstone, to which end he has an accomplice in tow: a creature called Knuckles, voiced by Idris Elba.  Some of the gags ('time to say goodbye to this piece of shiitake planet') will fly well over the heads of the film's target audience, but it's moderate family fun.  So is The Bad Guys, a jaunty Dreamworks animation about an animal gang planning a heist, based on the children's books but evidently also influenced by Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. "
"Apr 7, 2022",NEUTRAL," Morbius stars Jared Leto as Dr Michael Morbius (Marvel names always have that alliteration) who is a biochemist who at the beginning of the film gets a noble prize for his research into artificial blood and transfusion research. He needs this because of a rare blood disease he and a friend named Milo (played by Matt Smith) have- a disease which causes him to be isolated and depressed. Much like a comic book movie from the past Morbius lets a science experiment go awry (this time with vampire bats) and turns into a vampire. Milo also becomes involved in a rather expected way. What works in Morbius is when it leans into the camp and particularly Smith has fun with monster movie silliness of it all. Unfortunately those moments are too far between and Leto takes his role too seriously. I know many criticize the MCU for being too light and jokey but I could have used more of that here in Morbius. As it was it was dull and generic which is a real shame because the cast is talented and the premise has potential to be weird and exciting. In the end, it’s just forgettable. Now let’s talk about an actual good movie, RRR. Like I said RRR is directed and written by S.S. Rajamouli who helmed my introduction to action Indian cinema Baahubali 1 and 2. Those films were fantasy action where RRR is based on a true story. It is set in 1920 when a girl is abducted by a British governor and 2 men, Ram (Ram Charan) and Bheem (N.T. Rama Rao Jr) seek to find her and become great friends along the way. As we follow the friends on their quest we are treated to incredible action spectacle and musical sequences I am still thinking about a week later. As I was watching I forgot about the 3 hour run time and was engrossed in one amazing moment after another. I don’t know if it is as good as either Baahubali film but all 3 films show Rajamouli is one of the greatest directors working today and is making something truly special. It’s cinema! I especially loved a whole song devoted to friendship and another where they are dancing at ball challenging the British to a dance-off. Not only are both of these scenes a blast but they also serve as piercing commentary on colonization and traditional male roles. With all the bombastic energy of RRR it’s not just spectacle, it has something to say and characters that are easy to root for. The cinematography is big and bold and everything is done with gleeful abandon. It makes for a special film I expect will end up on my best of 2022 lists. So there you have it. One blockbuster that is forgettable with Morbius and one that makes a huge impression with RRR. Have you seen either? Let me know in the comments section! “I especially loved a whole song devoted to friendship”, there’s a lot of friendship songs in Bollywood (Hindi-language cinema) especially so you’ll love that, lol! Outstanding review! After watching RRR many times, I couldn’t get the emotional, visual and story satisfaction from other movies like Avatar 2, Thor Love and Thunder, The Marvels, Flash and many mainstream Hollywood films compared to RRR. I am eagerly waiting for SSMB29, Rajamouli’s next movie after RRR which will be adventure like Uncharted."
"Apr 6, 2022",NEUTRAL," Ian Simmons launched Kicking the Seat in 2009, one week after seeing Nora Ephron’s Julie & Julia. His wife proposed blogging as a healthier outlet for his anger than red-faced, twenty-minute tirades (Ian is no longer allowed to drive home from the movies). The Kicking the Seat Podcast followed three years later and, despite its “undiscovered gem” status, Ian thoroughly enjoys hosting film critic discussions, creating themed shows, and interviewing such luminaries as Gaspar Noé, Rachel Brosnahan, Amy Seimetz, and Richard Dreyfuss. Ian is a member of the Chicago Film Critics Association. He also has a family, a day job, and conflicted feelings about referring to himself in the third person. I can see the future. Soon after I’ve added this review to Rotten Tomatoes, someone (or several someones) will post an indignant comment below, questioning my sanity—or at the very least my credentials as a film critic. How, this concerned troll will wonder, could I spend 3,300+ words trashing Matt Reeves’ The Batman, while devoting even a pixel of praise to Daniel Espinosa’s ill-conceived and never-requested Morbius movie? By this point, the first mid-credits scene had begun and Johnny was confused. He kind of recognized the actor on screen but wasn’t sure how. I explained who he was, and what other Marvel movie he’d appeared in. “Oh, shit! That’s right. That’s dope as hell, yo! Y’know, they should get all the Marvel guys together in a movie, man. Like in the cartoons. Have Fantastic Four and the X-Men and Spider-Man. Yo! What if, like, fuckin’ Wolverine fought Morbius, man?” I gave a quick overview of how Marvel had sold its character rights to various studios in the 80s and 90s, back when comic book movies weren’t anything like they are today—only to buy them back decades later in an effort to bring all their properties under one mega-profitable in-house banner. So, yes, within five years, I explained, Johnny would likely get to see Reid Richards fighting Thanos Jr. or whomever. “Yo, I like the way you think about shit. It’s like real detailed. That shit makes sense, yo. But I still think they should have all the characters in one movie.” Soon the second post-credits scene came on. Like me, Johnny understood exactly what he was seeing, but neither of us could understand why we were seeing it. Despite what you may think, it was the opposite of frustrating. We considered it a beautifully weird mystery that might one day be solved for us. Or, we figured, it could be easily forgotten dead-end fan bait. As we waited for the final post-credits stinger (there wasn’t one), Johnny talked about how much he dug Morbius. He liked it a lot more than both Venom movies, and thought it was cool that Marvel was doing something new with horror. I told him I agreed, and later as we walked out of the auditorium together I realized that I’d made the right decision in coming out to see Morbius with the people instead of with my fellow film critics. In the weeks leading up to the movie’s release, I imagine folks like Johnny were excited for a new Sony-verse adventure. Would there be a direct connection to Spider-Man: No Way Home? Or would this just be a cool vampire action movie in the vein of Blade? Meanwhile, I’d waded through (and, [raises hand guiltily], joined in) endless tiresome discussions and articles about how the film was destined to be Sony/Marvel’s first gargantuan flop, based solely on criteria like star Jared Leto’s over-the-top performances** in House of Gucci and Suicide Squad; the screenwriters’ troublesome filmographies; Matt Smith’s apparent confusion regarding his character, and the fact that the idea of an undead supervillain is beyond lame. There was blood in the water before the first wound, which is usually a sign that a movie is about to be unfairly maligned. Is Morbius good? I would classify it as “okay”, which in some circles translates to “bad” (and even “irredeemably awful”). The further I get from it, the more its flaws seem crippling, but I admire the spirit that Espinosa and company brought to the project, which, I’m convinced, was nearly destroyed by a meddlesome and cowardly studio. The movie follows Dr. Michael Morbius (Leto), a world-renowned hematologist who has dedicated his life to finding a cure for the rare blood disease that afflicts him and his childhood friend, Lucien (Smith). Deep in the jungles of South America, he discovers a colony of vampire bats whose DNA may hold the key to reinvigorating diseased tissue. It’s junk science, of course, especially since I’m pretty sure splicing human and bat DNA doesn’t grant the recipient the ability to manifest wispy, colorful clouds of pseudo-teleportation signatures in mid-air (think a Mardi Gras version of Nightcrawler’s “Bamf!” powers in X2). As you know from the trailers (or the premise), Morbius’ experiment leads to mixed results. The frail, pale, bone-thin scientist becomes a buff dreamboat with a bona fide healing factor, insane reflexes, and…an animalistic thirst for blood—which he unleashes on the crew of mercenaries he’d contracted to secure the steamer ship in which he conducts his unethical research on international waters. The multiple homicides cause problems for Morbius and his would-be girlfriend, fellow scientist, Martine (Adria Arjona), putting the FBI on their trail and leading to Lucien’s learning of his friend’s “success”. Of course, you can see where this is going. Lucien steals the formula and abuses his newfound powers; Morbius has to stop him; the bumbling feds provide little more than half-hearted comic relief, and Martine gets damsel-ized in Act Three (despite the film giving her a solid show of being a supportive yet independent character until the last possible second). What you may not predict, and what I feel has been lost in the endless, tiresome pile-ons by crossed-arms critics, is the degree of care that the filmmakers put into building a unique Marvel universe protagonist. Sure, Michael Morbius has the science-gone-wrong powers of a Spider-Man or a Hulk and the million-IQ-but-zero-people-skills of a pre-Iron Man Tony Stark, but there’s real tragedy in his story, which peeks through the ripped corners of this well-worn yet enjoyable comic book movie. Take, for instance, one of Morbius’ motivations for finding a cure. Yes, it would potentially heal his unreliable legs; yes, it could benefit millions of other people in countless ways. But it would also mean that he wouldn’t need blood transfusions three times a day. The revelation passes by in a snippet of dialogue, but stopping to consider what this character goes through—and the stamina and drive required to become a Nobel Prize winner in spite of that constant derailment to his personal life and professional schedule—it’s enough to make even cynical reviewers like me think, “Damn, I hope this works out for him.” The irony, though, is that vampirism requires Morbius to drink copious amounts of blood in order to survive—on a schedule, he soon realizes, means four “transfusions” per day instead of three. There’s also some fine drama between Morbius and Lucien (who, for cosmically sad reasons established early on, is called “Milo” throughout most of the movie). Matt Smith plays Lucien as a man approaching middle age whose considerable intellect and resources have not managed to offer one bit of hope to the rot that’s slowly growing inside his body. His heel turn can be seen from space, but the 45 minutes leading up to it are a nice compliment to Leto’s search for a cure; I got the feeling Morbius was, at times, more interested in saving his friend (who had been severely bullied as a kid) than in what the research might mean for himself. Between the rushed murder of a father figure’ the CGI slug-out between two swooping arch-enemies who’d barely had time to develop a true hero/villain rapport, and an ending stacked twelve-high with multi-layered nonsense, Morbius not only fails to stick the landing—it misses the narrative runway by a country mile. One of the first things you’ll notice, if you’ve seen any of the trailers, is that the film is stuffed with partial scenes. The previews tease an entire climax that never manifests; a playful button on the “I. Am. Venom” line, and what appears to be the lead-up to Morbius’ controversial Nobel Prize acceptance speech—which is referenced in dialogue after the fact, but cut off, while the good doctor is still seated on the stage. The second thing you’ll notice, if you haven’t figured it out already, is that there appears to be a much longer (and, I’d imagine, richer) cut of Espinosa’s film languishing in the Sony vault. There is so much thematic and connective tissue that I had to fill in while watching this thing that it’s no wonder people will call me crazy for going to bat for what is, essentially, an incomplete movie. When we cut to Lucien doing a going-out-on-the-town dance for minutes on end (like Patrick Bateman re-enacting Spider-Man 3’s jazz club scene), it’s unclear why such a goofball moment was allowed to remain in an under-two-hour comic book movie. The answer, I suspect, is there was a lot more to his emergence as a villain (a dark mirror of Morbius’ super-powers test-drive montage). Like most other major plot threads in Morbius, it was whittled down to near-impressionistic impracticality. Same with Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal’s four-steps-behind feds. Same with Jared Harris’ role as the head of a kindly home for ill children, who becomes Alfred to Lucien’s bedsore Bruce Wayne. Same with whatever the hell was going on with Martine in the movie’s final moments. Even the opening and closing credits are the work of an exhausted, compromised, and confused creative team. These are truly the worst titles ever slapped onto a comic book movie—so bad, in fact, that I recommend ducking into a Morbius screening the next time you’re at the multiplex, just to see how blandly the film was announced to the world. Imagine pitching The Neon Demon as a CW drama before you’ve cast a single actor, and you’ll get the idea. I wasn’t a fan of Espinosa’s Alien ripoff, Life. I didn’t bother with co-writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless’ Gods of Egypt or Power Rangers (though I thoroughly enjoyed the duo’s work on the goofy but serviceable The Last Witch Hunter). But I always try to approach new movies with an open mind, regardless of what the filmmakers may have done before (this applies to creators whose work I love, too). In the case of Morbius, I saw bits of a really promising story that were atomized for the sake of a slim runtime. Nowadays, two-and-a-half-hour comic book movies are reserved for proven brands, I guess, and someone forgot to set those parameters at the script stage. So, yes, I’m officially “mixed-to-positive” on Morbius. In its current state, there’s a lot to be desired, but I feel the same way about The Batman. For all the talk of Morbius inartfully recycling old comic book movies, there’s a delicious Type O hypocrisy when it comes to Reeves’ Dark Knight caper, which not only uses an identical set of villains from thirty-year-old Batman sequels, but also proudly displays a brooding, one-note lead and third-rate David Fincher aesthetics and plot points. My fellow critics and I largely wrote off Joss Whedon’s version of Justice League, but a number of us (not me) were won over by the re-tooled Zack Snyder’s Justice League a few short years later. If comics movie fans can rally legions to demand that WB dump millions of dollars into putting out a twice-as-long, black-and-white version of a reviled film—based solely on the fact that they’d resonated with something in the original cut that they knew could be shaped into an actual movie—I feel comfortable saying that, as-is, Morbius is good enough to warrant further interest. Few people besides Daniel Espinosa have actually seen the film as advertised, and  I think I speak for both myself and Johnny when I demand, ""Release the Morbius cut!” *Except for one moment in the middle of the movie when I shot an angry look up and over my shoulder to silence his annoying cellphone conversation—only to realize he wasn’t on the phone. **I’ve never understood the Jared Leto hate. Sure, he was the worst Joker, and gave, by many accounts, a sub-Mario Brothers performance in House of Gucci, but he’s also an Academy Award-winning actor. Once lauded for roles in The Dallas Buyers Club, American Psycho, and even his breakout role on TV’s My So-Called Life, he’s become a media punching bag. So what if he’s an oddball in real life, or an obnoxious space cadet on late-night talk shows? He’s a talented actor who invests fully in his roles—some of which turn out to be a bit too big for anyone’s taste. But a good deal of that blame must be laid at the feet of the director and the studio. They auditioned, hired, and guided him through a particular kind of performance that someone at the top felt was exactly what their film needed. Half a dozen people on each project would have been invested with the power to cut him loose at any time if he’d not gelled with the filmmaker/studio’s overall vision (and if they were too stupid, lazy, or scared to fire Leto—for whatever reason—that still largely absolves the actor of blame)."
"Apr 5, 2022",NEGATIVE," The film follows Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) as he works to uncover a cure for him and his best friend since childhood Milo (Matt Smith), but this discovery leads to dangerous consequences in the form of a newfound thirst for blood along that comes along with their new power and strength.  Morbius spends time establishing the world and its characters, which does add depth to the story, but also allows the audience to know that Morbius as a character, especially performed by Jared Leto is not as interesting as we would like.  The main feeling I had throughout watching Morbius is how my attention shifted when Milo was introduced again in the present day, played by Matt Smith. There was much-appreciated energy to his performance.  I could understand from earlier moments how he would become the villain of the film, but still seeing the remnants of the boy we were introduced to in the beginning of the film. There was a charm, while also showcasing a glimmer of hatred and anger within the character.  When Milo takes matters into his own hands, ignoring the consequences, it does not feel out of place, and leads to some wonderfully campy and bright moments of Milo exploring his new powers. The energy Matt Smith brings to the role is captivating and kept me engaged throughout, while other aspects of the film hindered from complete enjoyment.  Adria Arjona is not given much time to explore her character Martine Bancroft, who is underwritten and underutilized. Martine is not explored much outside her relationship with Morbius, and even this does not get much focus within the film. She is a doctor and we have a few moments of her interacting with patients, but for most of the film, she is largely pushed aside.  Some of the moments of horror within Morbius really land and build suspense in a natural and exciting way, but these moments are too few and too far apart, leading to most of the action within the film to feel more relegated to the ‘superhero’ zone.  Even so, some of the visuals within those more superpower-focused fights were fun, especially when the film really played with color instead of focusing on white, grey, and black smoky tendrils. The moments where bolder colors such as blue, purple, and orange were used gave life to these action-centric moments.  The horror within the film worked well–when it was present. We could blame the rating and say the PG-13 hindered the horror, and maybe that has something to do with it, but that somewhat does a disservice to the wonderfully gory and memorable PG-13 horror films that have been made before this.  One aspect of the horror that did not land well for me comes in the depiction of Morbius. With a film exploring morality and showcasing characters who are not seen as fully heroes or villains, it is important that both characters–the seemingly good and bad–need to have similar moments of menace.  I personally never felt any danger coming off Morbius outside his first transformation. There are so many ways the film could have explored his dilemma more, his moments of blacking out.  Personally, I feel more menace from Chicklet not knowing what she’s done in Psycho Beach Party. Morbius does not explore the full potential of the character and his reluctant, uneasy connection with this new, dangerous part of himself.  Morbius has some visual moments that work well and recall an earlier decade of horror and the superhero, especially the moment in the hospital hallway.  The film has standout moments, but overall, the visual style is underwhelming–I couldn’t tell if the top of the screen was messed up, or if one corner of the frame was always tinted teal.  With the music, I enjoyed how it pulsating with the action scenes. But the music seemed to be at this very high, harsh level throughout most of the movie.  This intensity of sound would have worked better if regulated to specific moments of action rather than used throughout the film for any moment with even the semblance of tension.  Morbius sometimes works great, but these memorable moments are spaced too sporadically throughout the film. It’s worth watching to see the delightful performance from Matt Smith, who perfectly balances the campiest moments with the most emotionally resonant. "
"Apr 5, 2022",NEGATIVE," It’s hard to say if Morbius was doomed from the start, but after years of anticipating its tepid arrival, the final film earns a yawn as large as its protagonist’s unhinged snarl. The response it sparks in the viewer lacks any heat or venom; pun most definitely intended. You can’t be mad about it. If anything, you’re relieved. We’re finally free from watching its stream of neverending trailers. The movie theaters are safe again. Let’s take a moment and appreciate Morbius‘s agonizing crawl to our screens. There was release date number one: July 10, 2020. Then, the pandemic necessitated its push toward March 19, 2021, before receiving a second shift toward October 8, 2021. But No Time to Die moved into its release window, and Morbius fled for January 21, 2022… and then pushed another week to January 28, 2022. Omnicron reared, and Morbius finally found its spot on April Fool’s Day. For those counting, that’s six retreats, meaning Morbius got more bumps than The New Mutants. And we couldn’t shut up about that infamous mess. With Morbius, however, you and I will forget about it before finishing this review. It’s harmless. The only thing it kills is time. The title character, played by Jared Leto, suffers from a rare blood disease. Unless he can pull off an ethically gray and utterly illegal genetic transplant involving vampire bats, his days are numbered. So, the bad boy doctor rejects his Noble prize and boards an ocean liner where he can carry out his experiments on international waters. Morbius’s research is funded by his childhood pal Milo (Matt Smith), who is inflicted with the same deadly condition. To protect his science, he foolishly fills the floating laboratory with pistol-packing mercenaries. They’re real jerkwads, flagrantly dismissing Morbius’s sidekick and love interest Dr. Bancroft (Adria Arjona), enthusiastically attempting to earn our ire so we can relish their throats getting eviscerated a few scenes later. Milo doesn’t mind the voguing or the unquenchable desire for blood. He wants in on Morbius’s quick-fix, stealing the serum from under his bud’s radically upturned nose. It’s a classic BFF switcheroo: Professor X vs. Magneto, Harry Osborn vs. Peter Parker. Handcuffed to a PG-13 cinematic universe, director Daniel Espinosa sells the violence primarily on sound design and brief splashes of impossibly black blood. As slow and modeled as Morbius attacks, any contact with his opponents is blurry, fast, and out of sight. Masking the action even further is Oliver Wood‘s dreary cinematography, draping shadows on top of shadows and lighting everything else like a dentist’s office. Confusing matters most are the two films Jared Leto and Matt Smith are performing within. Leto wants to walk the gothic, keeping pace with moody, self-loathing bloodsuckers like Brad Pitt’s Louis from Interview with a Vampire. Smith lives in ham-town, clearly having a blast in front of the camera, embracing his villainous tantrums with petulant glee. They collide on-screen but repulse each other, ejecting the audience in the process. Barely existing along the fringes are Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal as the two FBI agents on loan from the Law and Order slush pile. They mostly drip quips and make vague allusions to the Venom movies, but Morbius‘s insecurity pulsates obscenely with every Daily Bugle reference. The thin-as-ice ties to better movies don’t act like the buoys the studio so clearly wishes them to be; instead, they operate as aggressive threats, “hand over your cash to Morbius, and this dreck will sink our other tangentially related Spidey-films.” There’s a bit in the movie where Gibson and Madrigal have Leto in the box. Morbius’s gory thirst is reaching critical levels. He tells them, “I’m hungry. You wouldn’t like me when I’m hungry.” Yep, it’s another reminder of a better comic book property, The Incredible Hulk television series. But it’s also the same joke that The Incredible Hulk movie made in nearly the same way. It’s a swing and a miss and indictive of Sony’s desperate desire to have what they never can. They don’t have the Avengers. They don’t have the X-Men. They only have Spider-Man, a character that flailed under their umbrella until they gave the reigns over to Marvel Studios. While Tom Holland made billions, they reached deep into Spider-Man’s rogue’s gallery and pulled out Venom and Morbius and Kraven and Big Wheel – okay, that last one has no projects in motion, but just you wait. Sony is determined to make a universe from Spidey’s B-list, C-List, and D-List, but maybe they should have worried about making a kick-ass vampire film first and foremost. Morbius is too caught up in modern superhero narratives and aesthetics. They should have followed Leto’s lead, chasing the fully fanged cinematic terrors of yore rather than the spandex dynamics of today. Of course, even Leto’s loose horror nods are cues to superior endeavors. Around every corner in Morbius are reminders of characters and worlds you’d rather occupy. When the inevitable multiple mid-credits sequences appear, you’re left to roll your eyes. What you see is not Plan A. It’s probably not even Plan B. The ADR runs rampant; the actors on screen appear to cohabitate in different rooms and at different times. If you squint hard enough, you can spot the Scotch tape and glue holding the frame together. The logic of the dialogue doesn’t align, and whatever future the movie is promising contradicts past narratives and teases no one. Our only hope is prayer, a whisper to the film gods; please let this final scene go the way of X–Men: Apocalypse‘s Essex Corporation and Green Lantern‘s Sinestro Corps. Morbius‘ tyranny can end here. It need not infect any other franchise."
"Apr 5, 2022",NEGATIVE," It’s unfair, but mostly accurate, to call Morbius a speed bump in the trajectory of comic book films. As the dominant form of global entertainment, this particular subgenre has been taking over the discourse for the past 20 years, and there’s bound to be a stumbling block every now and then. But this is at best an inert collision of iffy concepts, either way too much money or not nearly enough, and not learning the lesson of what’s great about the Venom movies (Tom Hardy committing 1,000 percent and Michelle Williams never forgetting to “yes and” the situation). Michael Morbius is a brilliant geneticist and mechanical engineer who has spent his entire life near the verge of death because of an unexplained hematological disorder. (It might have something to do with coagulants, but they really don’t explain, figuring the visual of frail children hooked up to machines in flashbacks will get the point across.) He’s finally found A Breakthrough that could properly save his life (as well as his longtime friend/benefactor Milo and the assorted bedridden children who pop up whenever the film needs a quick jolt of unease). Before you know it, he’s got a giant tube of bats in the lab from which he can extract DNA to “fix” the situation. Morbius wants to be The Fly, but as a hero. Morbius the character might as well be an infirm model who gets taken over by computer graphics when the plot gets shaky, which is often. Winning the Oscar for Dallas Buyers Club continues to be the worst thing that could have possibly happened to Jared Leto. That validation has changed his philosophy and judgment when it comes to performance, and The Artist Formerly Known as Jordan Catalano has been ... well, let’s just call it trying things on set, whether it’s his noxiously awful (both onscreen and off) Joker in Suicide Squad, or his ambitious, even-a-broken-clock-is-right-twice-a-day take on Paolo Gucci in House of Gucci. But the problem with Morbius, both the film and the character, is that you can never escape the fact that Leto feels superior to the material, and this creates an insurmountable gap that completely derails the film from being anything except 105 minutes of treading water. The perfunctory, expected and shockingly lazy mid-credits scenes might as well be flashing neon signs saying “Look! Something important, finally.” But even they promise developments in Sony’s Marvel outlet division that don’t carry the slightest bit of heft or promise. That’s no slight on Michael Keaton, but honestly, who gives a shit? As far as the Sony side of things, there’s Tom Hardy as Eddie ’n' Venom, and there’s the animated Spiderverse, and those are the things audiences really care about. It is impossible to imagine Leto’s Morbius sharing the screen with any of our current Spidermen, because it’s a character whose conflicts are all engineered to make him an antihero. That’s a perfectly acceptable approach, but it doesn’t mesh with anything we’ve seen from the Spiderverse to this point, and if you recall Suicide Squad, Leto’s Joker could only even fit in through the lens of that film’s MVP, Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn. Likewise, House of Gucci became a scientific exercise where each lead actor was in a different movie, like a kumite for acting styles. So Leto is at a place in his career where he’s gone Edward Norton and can’t play well with others, and the current mode of comic book adaptations demands that skill above all others. Even when at his most on-a-tear, Robert Downey Jr. always engaged with everyone around him like compatriots. Morbius is not a complete disaster — even if less than a day after viewing, it’s already getting the murky edges of a film you see while having dental work done, fuzzy edges already consuming indifferent plot points (and also not helped by seeing Everything Everywhere All At Once and RRR in the interim, both of which are exceptionally imaginative and vibrant works that thrive on analysis and multiple viewings). Its opening and closing credits are an Art Deco promenade, done with state-of-the-art bisexual lighting. Jared Harris has a few scenes where he classes up the proceedings immeasurably, including with secret weapon Matt Smith that becomes an intense meditation of vampire respectability politics that feels like the first time we get an actual idea on screen. The effects tend toward the trippy side of the things, with lots of swirly light and a weirdo kinesis that begs for 3-D. But it’s up to Leto to hold it all together, or at least be the cheese that ties the casserole together, and he’s not up to it. You can’t help but keep your eye on Smith. In his three years as the 11th Doctor, he made it through periodically sweaty scenarios and dodgy CG and emerged triumphantly through charisma and a generous sense of spirit, and it’s why he pretty much walks away with the parts of this film you remember. Despite the fact that he is one of the most recognizable heroes in global sci-fi and fantasy, major motion pictures can only find roles for him where he’s an artsy pimp, or a computer program, or Charles Manson. So he runs with it, and his Milo makes the film fitfully come to life. But it’s all too rare, and to no avail. However Morbius plays out at the box office, someone at Sony needs to send Tom Hardy a fruit basket, because he’s doing the vast majority of the heavy lifting over in their pavilion at Marvel world."
"Apr 5, 2022",NEUTRAL," Michael (Jared Leto) and his best friend Milo (Matt Smith) share this mysterious illness which has left them debilitated, forced to walk with canes. Determined to find a cure, Mobius takes off for Cerro de la Muerte in the misty mountains of Costa Rica, where thousands of vampire bats dwell. There’s a flashback to Greece – 25 years earlier – recalling frail, young Michael (Charlie Shotwell) in a children’s clinic under the care of sympathetic Dr. Nicholas (Jared Harris). That’s where Michael meets a wealthy British lad, Lucien (Joseph Esson), who suffers from the same malady. Nicknaming his new friend Milo, Michael compares them to the Spartans: “We are the few against the many.” Cut back to Morbius’ New York-based Horizon laboratory, where he stuns his colleague, Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), by turning down the Nobel Prize for his development of artificial blood because he feels that’s just the beginning of his life’s work. Instead, Michael uses a centrifuge to combine his DNA with that of Costa Rican vampire bats. Since this kind of experimentation is unethical and illegal, he takes Martine with him on a cargo ship that sails off the Eastern Seaboard. Milo then wants in on the violent vampire carnage. In their final battle, Milo insists their new condition is not a curse but a gift – just what the Green Goblin said in “Spider-Man: No Way Home” (2021). Flimsily scripted by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, the formulaic saga is directed by Daniel Espinosa, who stages overly shadowy action sequences. Plus, there are two post-credits ‘teaser’ scenes."
"Apr 5, 2022",NEGATIVE," And here's Jared Leto, ditched from the DC Extended Universe for his hammy take on The Joker, starring in his first solo movie for Marvel. It's the dullest film to ever carry that flickering logo. But, this time, I'm blaming the writers. He plays Dr Morbius, a scientist with a life-shortening blood condition, who has the genius idea of curing himself by splicing his DNA with that of a vampire bat. Now, he has a ravenous thirst for blood (like a bat), can hear screams from miles away (kind of like a bat), is superstrong (are bats hard?) and can jump really high (surely that's a frog?)."
"Apr 5, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Just plain miserable to sit through, offering almost nothing pleasurable either ironically or unironically."
"Apr 4, 2022",NEUTRAL," Sony really needs audiences to buy a movie ticket to this, because they have a lot more planned. Pretty please with a blood bag on top? After a lifetime surviving a rare blood disease, Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) is close to synthesizing a cure for himself and other sufferers. Combining vampire bat DNA with the human genome could unlock the secret, but ethics issues force him to tap friend-since-childhood and fellow sufferer Milo (Matt Smith) to set up an offshore test site in international waters. Morbius is injected with the experimental serum by his lab partner Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), but the would-be cure transforms the doctor into a hybrid creature with a craving for blood… a living vampire. When a fresh body drained of blood turns up while the doctor is researching his needs and new abilities, the NYPD closes in, and even Morbius himself can’t say for sure he is or isn’t the murderer… or if he could stop himself from doing it again. It’s possible Jared Leto was born to play the title character in Morbius — far more than Suicide Squad’s Joker — for more reasons than sharing a similar look. With a screenplay by Dracula Untold writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless plus helmed by Life director Daniel Espinosa, Sony is leveraging the expansion of their Spider-Man co-licensing agreement with Marvel Studios into a bigger franchise beyond their success with Tom Hardy’s Venom films. As the first Marvel superhero film of the year but not the first official MCU entry, can Sony leverage a new-to-cinemas origin story into a Venom-sized hit, or will it take the upcoming Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness to wash the taste of blood out of viewers’ mouths? The Social Network, The Prestige, and even Marvel’s own Captain America: Civil War are just a few films mining the “best friends become enemies” trope. Complex emotions are supposed to run deep in these melodramas, but when it’s used as a plot outline instead of the story, it loses its bite. That’s the core conceit of Morbius: we know where it’s been, where it’s going, and there’s zero emotional impact when we get there without a hint of a denouement. While the CGI transformations and super-power effects are money well spent, it’s a total DC-MurderVerse move to computer-animate the entire final battle climax, never mind the WWE Hulkamania finishing move our protagonist is expressly incapable of. The screen writers also turned in Gods of Egypt… and it shows. Dr. Morbius hilariously has a “Degree of Science” certificate hanging in his apartment — not a thing, folks — but he was a Nobel-prize winning biologist in the comics (they got one right!) Like too many vampire-esque films these days, twin fang marks found on bodies don’t match up with a mouthful of incisors — details, people. The constant bloodsucker references were amusing, from exotic locations to the names of ships, and even characters getting in on the act with their own pokes at the genre — props to the sneaky Dracula Demeter reference. Sadly, the film champions style over substance, referencing scenes from horror films like Event Horizon and the writers’ own Dracula Untold, but character moments that make stories meaningful are reduced to footnotes going unread. Adria Arjona’s love interest Martine isn’t even given a proper refrigerator; how is this kind of plotting still a thing? Fans of Leto and Marvel completionists won’t be entirely disappointed, but the film is too brooding to be as fun as Venom: Let There Be Carnage. Even if Morbius doesn’t break as big as the Venom films, Sony still has unfettered access to their own MCU-canonical Spider-Man whenever they need one — thanks to No Way Home — as long as Andrew Garfield is willing to go up against an impending Sinister Six. Morbius is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence, some frightening images, brief strong language, and getting out of social situations by exploding into a thousand bats."
"Apr 4, 2022",NEGATIVE," The last time Oscar-winning actor and occasional musician Jared Leto (Dallas Buyers Club) graced the digital screens of varying sizes, he was delivering one of his most deliriously deranged, attention-grabbing performances in Ridley Scott’s House of Gucci. As Paolo Gucci, the repeatedly victimized, dimwitted, talent-starved heir to the luxury goods brand and long-lost Mario Brother, Leto left audiences awe-struck (among other unidentifiable feelings and emotions). If nothing else, Leto’s Paolo left an indelible mark on moviegoers and streaming viewers. The same, alas, can’t and won’t be said about Leto’s follow-up as the title character in Morbius, Sony Pictures’ latest, desperate attempt to expand the Marvel-related intellectual property (IP) currently under their control beyond the twice rebooted Spider-Man or Venom, a two-time, box-office success thanks in large part to Tom Hardy’s inspired dual turn as failed journalist Eddie Brock and his temperamental, body-sharing roommate/alien parasite. Leto’s thinly written character, Michael Morbius, a Nobel Prize-winning biochemist and inventor (artificial blood), suffers from an unnamed, ultimately fatal, blood disorder that leaves him in a perpetually weakened state. He requires periodic blood transfusions and crutches to get around. With the help of a deep-pocketed childhood friend, Milo (Matt Smith), who shares the same blood disorder and will therefore die before he can start using an AARP card, Morbius doesn’t just dream about finding a cure. He completely  wants to reverses the disorder’s effect. Somehow, Morbius’s research has led him into collecting hundreds of ravenous vampire bats from a remote, mountain-based cave in Costa Rica. Absconding with his collection back to the States, he creates a green-hued serum reliant on splicing human and vampire bat DNA. Nothing could go wrong with that kind of well-conceived plan, except, of course, it does so spectacularly. With the help of his assistant, Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), Morbius injects himself with the serum on a cargo ship in international waters, ostensibly due to legit concerns over the legality (or lack thereof) of his unsanctioned, protocol-free experiment. In short order, mercenaries aboard the cargo ship find themselves face to fang(s) with the new and improved Morbius. Gifted and/or cursed with superhuman strength, speed, and soon enough, bat-like echolocation, Morbius quickly dispatches anyone who crosses his path, feasting on their blood one moment and waking up back in blood-splattered human form the next. Unsurprisingly upset, if not fully disappointed by the results, a slightly despondent Morbius returns home in a hoodie. He’s eager to find a solution to his newfound condition, up to, but not only including a solution that will return him to his pre-serum form. Unfortunately for Morbius, he’s not the only one interested in the serum. Once exsanguinated bodies start to show up all over the city, the FBI sends a slow-walking, wise-cracking, third-tier duo, Stroud (Tyrese Gibson) and Rodriguez (Al Madrigal), to investigate the who and why behind the alarming rise in the city’s body count. Morbius eventually realizes he’s created more problems than he’s solved with his experiment. But if anyone is going to solve a problem like Morbius, it’s Morbius himself. Without the benefit of prosthetics or makeup (Sony created Morbius’s vampire iteration via unimpressive, under-rendered CGI), Leto gives one of the most restrained, passive performances of his career. In stark contrast to his broadly caricatured performance as Paolo Gucci, Leto’s turn as Morbius tends to hover around varying degrees of brooding in human form. He’s unconvincingly snarling when he transforms into the “living vampire” of the comics. An often bored-looking Leto isn’t helped by a formulaic, generic, cliché-ridden screenplay credited to Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless. Anonymous, borderline competent direction comes thanks to Swedish-born Daniel Espinosa’s (Life, Safe House), while the visual effects veer from the semi-cool (Morbius’s super-fast movements leave colorful trails in his wake) to boredom-inducing (fight scenes two or three steps below videogames). But, unfortunately, more of the latter. That Shelf sat down with Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver’s director and cast to discuss Netflix’s ambitious sci-fi sequel.

"Apr 4, 2022",NEGATIVE," Publisher’s Note: We are republishing this review because it’s being re-released into 1,000 theaters this weekend because online memes have inspired hate-watchers to continue to seek it out.  There was a moment during Morbius when I sat in the theater and thought to myself, “Gee, this might not be so bad after all.” I pulled out my phone and checked the time, and it was around the 30-minute mark for the movie. You see, the first act is confident, expedient, breezy — not artful but at least skillful in its execution. It’s the kind of first act that lets you know you’re in for a tight 90-minute joy ride that doesn’t take itself too seriously, something almost unheard of in comic book movies these days. Instead, it plays like a conscious throwback to those ’80s sci-fi action flicks that didn’t care whether you BELIEVED cops could be robots or robots could be time-travelers, it just needed you to know that’s what’s going on. Here, it’s laying out the fact that Michael Morbius is a doctor with a rare blood disease and he’ll do anything to find a cure — even if that includes experimenting with vampire bat DNA. Are all of those big, pivotal moments? No. But it hints at a lot of connective tissue that was stripped away (almost everything with Jared Harris and Tyrese is gone) to streamline the narrative and simplify this introduction to a complicated Marvel character — a villain who sometimes does good, or a good guy who is often really, really bad. If it was done with a clear vision of who Morbius should be in this movie, it could work! But I have a sneaking suspicion it was done not to serve the character, but to make the character serve their growing Spiderverse franchise (as a few specific trailer changes, in light of No Way Home, seem to verify). It’s all just some real filmmaking-by-committee sh*t, so much so that I’m loath to even drag in the names of director Daniel Espinosa and screenwriters Matt Sazama and Buck Sharpless, who I’m sure all tried their very best.  Anyway, the committee approach works in the first act because the backstory is more or less concrete, by-the-numbers, “this is how Morbius became a monster” stuff: Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) grew up in Greece, in a hospital catering to children with rare, life-threatening blood diseases. There he’s under the care of a doctor played by Jared Harris, who I’m sure has a character name but I cannot for the life of me remember it nor do I care to look it up. He also befriends another boy he calls Milo, who has the same illness and grows up to be Matt Smith. Michael becomes a genius doctor and medical researcher, who invents an artificial blood formulation (and rejects a Nobel Prize for the effort) on his path to finding a cure for his and Milo’s affliction. He goes to Costa Rica to trap some vampire bats to study, and eventually devises a cure that splices whatever part of their DNA creates anticoagulants into human DNA. In a hurry to perform a human trial he sets up a lab on a freighter in international waters with the help of his research partner/love interest, Martine (Adria Arjona), and proceeds to administer his new cure on himself. And it works! Sort of! It, uh, makes him into a vampire. But like, a living one. Other than that he’s hale and hearty and a little bit murdery. In the confusion of his transformation, Morbius kills everyone on the ship except Martine, then escapes. And that’s when the movie starts to lose its focus. Morbius doesn’t want to be a murderer, but the fact remains that he has to drink blood to maintain his health — and his artificial blood formula only cuts it for so long. Despite all of his new-found powers (strength, speed, echolocation, etc.) the price isn’t worth it, so Morbius prepares to find a cure for his cure — but then Milo shows up and steals the vampire serum because he’d rather be a healthy monster than a dying human. Milo, by the way, is very loosely based on the Marvel character called Hunger, mixed with a few other people. The rest of the movie is a sort of half-baked cat and mouse game between Milo and Morbius, where their motivations are barely sketched. Milo wants to goad Morbius into enjoying their new life as vampires rather than trying to reverse the cure, I think? And to do that he, uh, frames Morbius for a bunch of murders and also tries to kill everyone he loves? And Morbius just reacts the whole time, running and hiding and science-ing until the big climax. The end. For a character being set up for future appearances, Morbius isn’t all that compelling — though I’m hard-pressed to lay that blame on Leto’s performance. His offputtingness works fine for a character who is supposed to be exactly that. The issue is more that the movie treats him as the hero even though he is being set up to be A VILLAIN in the future, and can’t thread the needle. He could have been a noble monster — a man who can’t help but kill, but regrets it — and it might have worked. But besides that one moment on the boat, the movie refuses to let Morbius get his hands dirty, or finds a way to justify every questionable decision he makes. The result is a character who isn’t so much morally gray as too ineffectual to root for, and not bad enough to root against.  The other problem is that Matt Smith is RIGHT THERE, bursting at the seams with fun and charisma, and everything else suffers in comparison. I have a pet theory about Doctor Who actors, which is basically that a good Doctor is someone who would be better suited to play the villain in any other property (see: Eccleston, Capaldi, even Tennant when he’s feeling frisky). Smith’s Milo could be Exhibit A for my argument, and the fact that he manages to not just steal the spotlight but BE the spotlight in this otherwise drab movie is all the more impressive because his character is practically nothing — a completely disposable entity. He still suffers from the same lack of logical motivations and connective tissue that plagues the rest of the film, but because the stakes are lower there’s some actual freedom for him to take advantage of. I can’t speak to the scenes of his that wound up on the cutting room floor, but the stuff that remains is easily the best material the movie has to offer. He makes ugly knits and New Balance kicks look like designer duds, he does a straight-up Keyser Soze transformational walk, he dances around without his shirt on, he even pulls off a cheeky Doctor joke of his own (“On a scale of one to ten, how bad is your pain?” “ELEVEN”). He simply comes into every scene like he’s having the time of his life. If only the rest of the movie could say the same. The action and special effects are a mixed bag, and again seem to have been tweaked between the trailer and the release. There’s something interesting there, in the way the movie tries to depict the unusual bat powers — though the speed just makes the characters look like smoke, and the echolocation just makes the world look like smoke, and also I think there’s something to do with wind currents and hollow bones but it’s not really explained. Sometimes the slo-mo effects in the action look great, and sometimes it all is an indiscernible blob. The bigger issue is that the transformation effects to turn Morbius and Milo into their monstrous selves are inconsistent. The practical effects work well but are rarely used — probably because they don’t make the characters look comic booky enough. So then the CGI comes in when they’re really vamping out, and it’s just terrible. And all the while you’re looking at Matt Smith’s cheekbones and thinking, “Just give that man some contact lenses and fake teeth, he’s already BUILT FOR THIS.” I could go on, but unfortunately to get at the heart of Morbius’s ultimate failure I’ll have to dig into some larger franchise spoilers, so I’ll save that for a later piece (that will also cover the two end credit sequences). Ultimately I’ll say that the movie wasn’t the trainwreck I was expecting — it wasn’t irredeemably bad. It was almost even sorta good, for a few minutes at least, and Matt Smith’s performance single-handedly makes this one a worthwhile “get drunk and watch it on cable” flick. But I’d rather see a flaming disaster from a team of passionate creatives than a sanitized jigsaw puzzle assembled by a board of directors any day."
"Apr 4, 2022",NEGATIVE," Today, after seven (count ‘em) delays, Morbius officially arrives in theaters. On April 1, otherwise known as April Fools' Day, a day where brands tell terrible jokes with the hopes of retweets and likes. Is Morbius a sick joke on behalf of Sony and Marvel? Is it truly the uniquely cursed item it seems to be based on the seven (!) times it was pushed off the release schedule? In a way, the answer is yes and no. Like most April Fools' Day jokes, Morbius is not actually funny. It’s not bad in the ha ha you have to see this it’s so ridiculous kind of way. It just feels underbaked and lame—and, sadly, not weird enough to be any kind of fun. Morbius—and I promise, I’ll eventually get around to explaining just what or who a Morbius is—was announced in June 2018, before Sony had a bona fide hit on its hands with Venom, which proved that, hey, maybe these “Spidey villain movies without Spider-Man” might actually work. Originally scheduled for release in July 2020, Morbius just kept getting pushed back until it finally arrived today. Even the Venom sequel came and went before it did. When the April 1 date was ultimately revealed it seemed like a gag. However, you can actually buy tickets for Morbius now, even though that doesn’t mean it still doesn’t seem like a collective hallucination. Directed by Daniel Espinosa, who made the enjoyable Alien rip off Life, Morbius stars the king of doing too much Jared Leto as Dr. Michael Morbius. (Yeah, his birth name is Morbius.) The good doctor has a rare blood condition and has spent his life searching for a cure, which he believes might have come along when he injects himself with a serum he concocted from the insides of vampire bats. But, whoops, that doesn’t go as planned and he must now contend with the fact that he vants to suck your blood. Meanwhile, his similarly afflicted childhood pal Lucien (Matt Smith)—nicknamed Milo in an overly complicated saga—wants some of Morbius’ vampire bat juice, takes it, and becomes the tragic villain of the saga. At least Smith seems to be amusing himself, dancing around while Leto takes his work Very Seriously. From the moment Morbius begins the pacing seems off. It bounces around in time, and moves through exposition without grounding it in any sort of real place or emotion. Because of the seemingly endless parade of delays, it seems likely that whatever Morbius was supposed to be got chopped to bits in post-production. The references to the Marvel Cinematic Universe are dropped in two nonsensical credits sequences, where Michael Keaton reprises his role from Spider-Man: Homecoming shows up in an apparent tease of Spider-Man: No Way Home, a movie which has already come out. After spending about an hour and 45 minutes watching Morbius, downing Diet Pepsi to fight off post-lunch sleepies that seemed only augmented by the dour color palette and phrases like “bat radar” said with no hint of irony, it still felt like less movie than marketing to me. Last night, the editor Brandy Jensen tweeted: “blessed to have a brain just fully resistant to the concept of ‘Morbius.’ you can tweet about Morbius. you can write about Morbius and post clips of Morbius. still i will not believe Morbius is real.” Morbius is ostensibly a real movie, but just barely. It feels bound to exist more as a can-you-believe-that happened trivia question in future decades, considering I would probably guess this is the end of Sony’s attempts to turn the character into any sort of phenomenon. If you go to see Morbius today, the joke’s only on you."
"Apr 4, 2022",NEUTRAL," The Marvel comics world expands with ""Morbius,"" a film which seemingly has been on the slate to be released for 17 years now. (It's really only a few pandemic related shifts). As comic book movies go it's overwhelmingly underwhelming, a lifeless carcass of a film that serves its immediate purpose but inspires zero desire to have this character's story continue in future films. Jared Leto (sounding a lot like Crispin Glover) stars as the title character - a brilliant doctor suffering from a rare blood disease. Morbius has made it his life's work trying to find a cure that would help him and longtime friend Milo (Matt Smith). Morbius believes he has found the possible cure, fusing his DNA with bat DNA. The fusion comes with deadly side effects, the thirst for human blood and the inability to control that desire. Morbius wants to shut down the experiment, but when Milo shows interest it forces the doctor to face the consequences of his tests. The story moves along at a rather mundane clip with little drama - even as the stakes are risen. The screenplay from Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless never finds a consistent tone, unable to decide if wants to be an adventure story with an anti-hero origin story or a horror film that embraces the vampire mythology. Leto's performance is pretty anemic, with a cold approach that doesn't really give the audience anything to root for. Smith fares the best of the supporting cast, bringing a slight spark to his smarmy character, but Tyrese Gibson, Adria Arjona and Jared Harris are wasted in poorly underwritten roles. With multiple post credit scenes, it is apparent ""Morbius"" is meant to be the start of another Marvel franchise. If this introduction is any indication, the character lacks the bite to be memorable and move forward. This might be a franchise that is best abandoned in its infancy instead of forced to be pushed forward."
"Apr 4, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Alas, the total quantity of wit in this movie is to a soupçon what Jared Leto is to Daniel Day-Lewis. "
"Apr 4, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Morbius ultimately feels less than the sum of its parts. While there might have been a good movie somewhere pre-reshoots, the film never finds its footing. That said, it's not nearly as bad as others pre-decided it would be. "
"Apr 4, 2022",NEGATIVE," The basic story at the heart of True Things is a familiar one – nice but lonely and slightly mixed-up girl meets handsome, twinkly-eyed good- for-nothing. And from the moment the charmingly roguish and swiftly nick-named Blond saunters into the benefits office where Kate reluctantly works, we’re pretty sure no good is going to come of it. Blond – played by a bleached Tom Burke channelling an awful lot of mid-career Simon Le Bon – might as well have ‘Bad Lad’ tattooed across his forehead. But Kate, very nicely played by Ruth Wilson, is bored, there’s an instant mutual attraction and pretty soon they’re off for sandwiches, skinny-dipping and quite a lot of sex. But while Wilson – star of The Affair, of course – continues to impress, the film runs disappointingly out of steam as the last lap approaches. The release of Morbius – the latest film to feature yet another character plucked from a Marvel comic – has been delayed many, many times and as the first 15 minutes play out, it’s easy to imagine why. After all, the main plot, about a gifted doctor born with a debilitating genetic blood disorder transforming himself by combining human DNA with that of a vampire bat, does bear an uncanny resemblance to one of the most widely reported theories about the origins of the Covid-19 virus. But as the rest of the opening hour slowly unfolds, another possible explanation for the multiple delays presents itself. Morbius is dreadful, quite possibly the worst example of the comic-book, super-hero genre I’ve ever seen. Jared Leto isn’t actively bad as Dr Michael Morbius but he is almost criminally dull which, given that he’s become a living vampire inside half an hour, is quite an achievement. But this is a film where nothing works – there isn’t a single likeable character, the screenplay is lacking both structure and humour and far too often we’re left watching two blurry visual effects battling out against the background of an even blurrier third. It sees the old video game returning for a second live-action feature film outing with the help of a well-polished and genuinely funny screenplay, a fabulously bonkers performance from Jim Carrey as the evil Dr Robotnik and a very nice voice-turn from Idris Elba as Sonic’s supposed nemesis, Knuckles. We watch the criminal characters who give this animated feature its title – Wolf, Snake, Tarantula, Shark and Piranha – being forced to become good by the award-winning social reformer Professor Marmalade. Who’s a guinea pig, of course. But are they as bad as they like to appear and he as good as he says he is? It’s a little repetitive but a top voice cast led by Sam Rockwell, Awkwafina and Richard Ayoade eases the potential pain.

"Apr 4, 2022",NEGATIVE," Jared Leto injects himself with bat serum and develops a swooshy Fields of the Nephilim cloak, a man bun and the ability to see sound; Matt Smith injects himself and morphs into a Wall Street rogue trader, made entirely of pinstripes and evil. This, and their mutual need to chug pints of blood, rather strains their friendship in this incoherent, vampire-themed Marvel offcut.

"Apr 4, 2022",NEGATIVE," After many delays, we can finally watch “Morbius,” a blood-sucking example of why not everything ever published by Marvel Comics deserves a movie. This is an odd production for multiple reasons. The main one being is it makes absolutely no sense. It features a quite efficient cast led by Jared Leto, with a look that suggests he’s traded his alt-rock outfit Thirty Seconds to Mars for the gloomier corners of death metal. The cinematography has some moments of genuine style. Yet all of it gets lost in a haze of incoherent storytelling and a droning music score. Officially this is not an MCU movie, but a Columbia Pictures release that forms part of Sony’s “Spider-Verse,” made in collaboration with Marvel. Alas, it feels more like a throwaway movie made as an excuse to profit off a character who works best on the sidelines. Dr. Michael Morbius (Leto) is the latest character accursed by the comic gods. He walks with two canes due to a blood disorder that has plagued him since childhood. Now he obsesses over finding a cure. His research has led to the creation of an artificial blood that gains him fame. He even wins the Nobel Prize! But the good doctor turns it down, of course. It’s just as well, since his more reckless research is being secretly funded by childhood friend turned crooked billionaire Milo (Matt Smith), who also suffers from the same disease. Morbius decides to take his research to the next level and experiment with vampire-bat blood. He will be the first test subject but when he ingests his concoction, it transforms him into a vampire creature with snarling teeth, upturned nose, killer abs and big claws. He also suddenly hungers for blood. Luckily, all his packets of artificial blood keep the cravings at bay. As you have surely guessed, Milo doesn’t want to be left out of the fun. When he gets his hands on Morbius’s discovery, he too becomes a “living vampire” and the two must now clash. Even before the pandemic, “Morbius” was a troubled production that underwent multiple re-shoots. This may account for its oddly fractured feel. What proves truly fatal to the movie is the lack of effort in the story itself. Morbius as a character is taken from the Spider-Man universe. Those who grew up watching the ‘90s “Spider-Man” animated series will remember Morbius as a tragic, even romantic, character who dooms himself while trying to steal the formula that mutated Peter Parker. He also tends to come out at night, like an actual vampire. Director Daniel Espinosa is tasked with finding some excuse to make a whole action romp around the persona which ironically enough, feels like a retread to bad ‘90s comic book adaptations. Visually cinematographer Oliver Wood captures some of the style of the early “Blade” films, before hilariously designed CGI sequences take over.  “Morbius” doesn’t know if it wants to be horror, action or a loud hybrid of both. The stakes are never raised higher than Morbius lashing around his laboratory, feeling the need for blood which he satiates with his artificial invention. Once Milo becomes a “living vampire,” which is a fancy term used to explain why these guys can still run around in the daytime, the narrative actually doesn’t change much at all. Milo’s aims as a villain are reduced to him willing to eat a common citizen or two. Later he might hang out at local nightclubs to hit on women with his vampire prowess. Oddly enough, Smith doesn’t get to show off any new pecks like Leto, who of course transforms from scrawny to buff thanks to his bat DNA. The two must eventually battle by rushing at each other in slow motion, fangs and claws drawn, at the local subway station. No explanation is given as to why time slows down and smoky CGI mist spirals around them each time they brawl. Morbius also has an odd habit of dangling from his legs like an acrobat without any payoffs. The supporting roles in “Morbius” feel tossed in simply because we’re supposed to have two FBI agents present for comic relief, played by Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal, and a love interest, Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona). None of these characters feel as if they are given adequate screen time to justify their inclusion. The agents pop in at Morbius’s workplace, interrogate him, he escapes, and they become inconsequential. Bancroft is horrified by what’s happening to her boyfriend then disappears for a long while before coming back in the third act for the required, tragic rooftop scene where Morbius must decide if he should turn her into a vampire. The great Jared Harris meets the same fate of being wasted in this film as the doctor who cared for Morbius as a child, and still watches over Milo as an adult. All the bats featured in this movie, whether in an elegant encasement in Morbius’s lab, or swirling around in shots aping “Batman Begins,” have meatier roles.  “Morbius” has such a puzzling structure that even the opening moments feel like a deleted scene. We see Morbius exit a helicopter in a distant jungle. He approaches some bats in a cave and opens his hand with a slice on the palm. Never is this moment explained or given reason for being throughout the rest of the movie. Other aesthetic aspects feel just as confused. The beginning and end title credits are a dizzying parade of triangles with a retro ‘80s vibe that will be maddening for anyone sitting in a front row. Jon Ekstrand’s music score has no idea what it wants to be, switching from horror orchestral sounds to an endlessly loud, droning roar that sounds like a cross between a fire alarm and construction equipment. The cherry on top is the expected bonus end credits scene meant to connect “Morbius” to the rest of the Spider-Verse. It’s quite ridiculous in how a surprise villain appears and announces that we’re in for yet another “team” of misfits to be formed for a new franchise. Then again, maybe Morbius will work better as part of a larger crop facing off with our favorite web slinger. As a solo title, this vampire lacks bite."
"Apr 3, 2022",NEUTRAL," Sony/Columbia Pictures was on a nice roll recently with
their Spider-Man-related movies: Into the Spider-Verse, Venom: Let There Be Carnage, and Spider-Man: No Way Home. It has all come to a grinding
halt with Morbius. Although it would be difficult to argue that the
studio has given back all the goodwill it has accumulated in the past
few years, the bloom is off the rose. Morbius is not only a massive
disappointment but the marketing campaign promises more to fans than the
generic origin story delivers. Although the multiverse shenanigans from No
Way Home are sampled in a perfunctory fashion, that doesn’t happen until
midway through the end credits when Michael Keaton (who is featured in the film’s
advertising) makes his overdue appearance…which lasts all of about a minute.  Morbius opens with a scene that feels like it might
have been taken out of a mid-20th century vampire movie. An
emaciated Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto), barely able to walk, disembarks
from a helicopter to approach the opening of a large cavern that is home to a colony
of vampire bats. He slits open his hand and extends it, inviting the bats to
feast on his blood. They swarm around him and we’re treated to a flashback from
Michael’s childhood at a sanitarium in Greece. It chronicles his meeting with
lifelong friend Milo (played as an adult by Matt Smith) and illustrates his genius
as a scientist/engineer.  Most of the story takes place in New York City, where Michael
has relocated as an adult. During his life, in an attempt to find a cure for
the rare blood disease that afflicts him and Milo, he has invented a form of artificial
blood but his most promising experiments cross the line into the realm of the
unethical and involve splicing bat and human DNA. Feeling that time is running
out, Michael makes himself human trial #1. The results are promising – he has
increased speed, agility, and strength to go along with various bat-like abilities
(like echolocation) – but it comes at a price: like a vampire, he must consume
blood at regular intervals. Although the artificial brand initially works, he
realizes that, over time, he will have to start drinking real blood to
stay alive. Michael is horrified by the implications but Milo, who steals a
vial of the serum and injects himself, doesn’t share his friend’s compunctions.
The two become rivals and, as Michael hunts down Milo with the goal of stopping
him, Michael’s girlfriend, Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), continues to work diligently
in the lab. Morbius is the kind of bland, by-the-numbers origin
story that shows comic book movies at their least innovative. It follows
a familiar trajectory that shows the hero and villain gaining their powers, baiting
one another, then eventually fighting to the death. The ending is anticlimactic
and most of the pyrotechnics and associated special effects seem anything but “special”
in 2022. They’re not bad; they’re just a little overused and uninspired. When
Morbius employs echolocation, the result looks cool but makes no sense
whatsoever. Evidently, little effort was expended on figuring how to make this sensible
and coherent on-screen.  Jared Leto’s established intensity is on display. He’s broody
and moody but his work here lacks the energy with which he invested his other
comic book character, The Joker (in Suicide Squad). Here, he’s overshadowed
by Matt Smith, who gives it his all and is about as far away from his
milquetoast incarnation of Doctor Who as one might imagine.  Despite only being a little over 90 minutes long, Morbius
is a chore to sit through. It lacks imagination, zest, and a thrill of
discovery. While similar charges could be leveled against Sony’s first
Spider-Man villain spin-off, Venom, at least that film had a sense of
humor. Leto plays this with a seriousness that even Tolstoy might find dour. It’s
too early to condemn any eventual Sinister Six project (the pieces are still
being assembled) but, unless better writing is involved, it’s going to make the
theatrical release of Justice League look like a masterpiece. "
"Apr 3, 2022",POSITIVE," Those of us who failed to achieve a symbiotic relationship with the box-office hits that were 2018’s “Venom” and last year’s “Venom: Let There Be Carnage” can’t help but proceed with a bit of caution into “Morbius.” The big-screen debut for the Marvel Comics antihero is the newest entry into what the movie’s production notes refer to as the “Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters.” (More commonly referred to as “Sony’s Spider-Man Universe,” it sits outside the hugely popular Marvel Cinematic Universe controlled by Disney-owned Marvel Studios.) For now, at least, it matters little that the cinematic version of Morbius probably never will cross paths with, say, Chris Hemsworth’s Thor. What does matter is that “Morbius” is a surprisingly solid building block for Sony as it looks to expand its universe of heroes and villains. Starring Jared Leto as the vampiric Dr. Michael Morbius, the movie offers nothing remotely innovative in the inescapable superhero genre, but it also doesn’t frustrate. Thanks to Leto’s strong work as its incredibly powerful but also increasingly desperate titular character and competent direction from Daniel Espinosa, “Morbius” is a reasonably entertaining serving of pop culture that, at under two hours, doesn’t overstay its welcome. We meet Michael — whose longtime suffering from a rare and fatal blood disorder has spurred him to become the world’s top expert in bloodborne diseases and a pioneer in the development of artificial blood — in the jungles of Costa Rica. He is hunting for vampire bats. He brings many of the nightmarish mammals back to New York City to conduct research so controversial that it may cost him his medical license, which is why he tells his colleague Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona of “6 Underground”) that the less she knows about it, the better it will be for her professionally. Mixing bat and human DNA, he develops an artificial-blood formula that not only eliminates his need for crutches and makes him feel fantastic but also gives him superhuman strength and quickness, as well as the echolocation powers of the bat, aka “bat radar.” The downsides: The treatment works for only a few hours; the window between needed treatments is shrinking; and he now has a thirst for real human blood, along with the fake stuff. In fact, he is believed to be behind a deadly attack on a nurse with whom he’d worked. Although he doesn’t remember killing her, Michael recognizes he may not be fully in control of his urges when the treatments change his physical appearance, including providing him neck-ready fangs. While she does help him every step of the way, Martine worries he’s wading too far into dangerous waters. On the other side of the spectrum is his best friend, Milo (Matt Smith), who suffers from the same disease and whom Michael has known since they were children in the care of the kind Dr. Nicholas (Jared Harris), who continues to be invested in both of their lives. Nicholas certainly has reason to worry about Milo, who sees no negative in the work Michael has done and becomes furious with him when he refuses to share the treatment out of fear it will do Milo more harm than good. By now, you can see where “Morbius” will get its obligatory villain, and, rest assured, we get the requisite fights between super vampires. As with the movie as a whole, they are fine but nothing you haven’t seen done before — and done better. Nonetheless, you can’t help but be impressed by the work of Espinosa, who was born in Chile, raised in Africa and educated in Sweden. His previous work, the “Gravity”-meets-”Alien” 2018 sci-fi film “Life,” also was a bit above average, so he’s proving to be a filmmaker worth following. Here, he’s working from a decent screenplay by the writing tandem of Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (“The Last Witch Hunter,” “Gods of Egypt”), whose vampire bona fides include 2014’s “Dracula Untold.” If their script falls short in any way, it’s that it makes little use of the comedic gifts of “Fast and Furious” franchise standout Tyrese Gibson and comic Al Madrigal (“the Daily Show With Jon Stewart”), who were tapped to play FBI agents investigating Michael. And while Smith (“The Crown,” “Last Night in Soho”) is capably creepy as Milo once he gains his ability, “Morbius” belongs to Leto, an Academy Award winner for 2013’s “Dallas Buyers Club” who also can be seen starring in the enjoyable new Apple TV+ series “WeCrashed.” His steady, even nuanced performance in “Morbius” goes a long way toward us taking the whole affair relatively seriously. Before it’s done, “Morbius” gives us a vague reference to Venom and a fun nod to the old TV series “The Incredible Hulk.” And, of course, if you care about where Sony may be heading with this still-Spider-Man-lacking Spider-Verse, stick around for the closing credits to sink your fangs in for a hint or two."
"Apr 3, 2022",NEUTRAL," But even more than the financial success, the high quality of the movies they have produced has been impressive; especially when you consider their fantastical/ridiculous subject matter. After all this time it is easy to look back and assume that this incredible run was a foregone conclusion and that success was all but guaranteed. But Sony has done a great job of illustrating that this is not the case. Through several corporate machinations, Sony Pictures retains the rights to Marvel’s Spider-Man and his rogue’s gallery of villains. Sony wisely let Marvel incorporate Spidey into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after “The Amazing Spider-Man 2” nearly killed the franchise. But Sony decided to keep several of Spider-Man’s adversaries for themselves and the results have been three very-average-to-below-average movies with two “Venom” films and now most recently with “Morbius.” In fact, “Morbius” actually has all of the ingredients you need to make a good Marvel movie. You start with an intriguing character played by a talented actor. Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) is a brilliant scientist suffering from a debilitating blood disease. Searching for a cure for himself and his childhood friend Milo (Matt Smith), Morbius develops a serum that combines human DNA with vampire bat DNA. The serum gives Morbius super-human strength and agility, but the effects are quickly reversed if he does not consume human blood. The entire crux of the movie is set up in Morbius’ moral dilemma, does he continue to stay strong and awesome by consuming human blood or does he allow himself to become feeble and potentially die? This is compelling stuff, but after the movie goes to all the trouble of setting the table, it forgets to bring out the main course. Morbius’ internal conflict is brushed aside and the movie’s central theme is abandoned and forgotten in a chaotic mass of special effects and a mad rush to set up more sequels. “Morbius” lets a decent premise and performances go to waste and leaves you only to wonder what Marvel would have done with the character (or if they would have given him his own movie at all)."
"Apr 3, 2022",NEGATIVE," The successes of “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” (2018) and “Spider-Man: No Way Home” (2021) have reinvigorated a Marvel flagship comic franchise, but while the spinoffs have been lucrative they have so far been critically reviled. “Morbius” seems to be part of a trend following “Venom” (2018) and “Venom: Let There Be Carnage” (2021). Although revolving around a fearsome antihero dubbed the Living Vampire, who first appeared in “The Amazing Spider-Man” comics in 1971, the new film decidedly lacks bite.  While otherworldly escapism is a big part of the appeal of adapted-from-comics movies, “Morbius” does not have nearly the scale or gravitas that fans have come to expect. Take the legacy character out of the equation, and this is virtually indistinguishable from any garden-variety horror/thriller released in the post-Oscars dumping ground.  “Morbius” opens amid the lush mountains and waterfalls of Cerro de la Muerte in Costa Rica, where Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) slashes his palm in front of a cave in order to summon a torrent of bloodsucking bats. It’s a spectacular, though somewhat gratuitous, set piece.  The narrative then briefly flashes to 25 years prior, when young Michael (Charlie Shotwell) met Lucien (Joseph Esson), whom he inexplicably nicknamed Milo, at a hospital in Greece where they were treated for a blood disorder that rendered them barely able to walk, even with crutches.  Present-day Dr. Morbius has devoted his life to finding a cure for this affliction, and he is not above risking his medical license toward that end. He creates chimera cells with the DNA of bats that feed on blood, and proceeds to have them injected into his spine. His discovery does more than cure his condition, as he can now dangle from the ceiling — but he is also turned into a living vampire.  Mr. Leto convincingly portrays Dr. Morbius as he transforms from frail and debilitated weakling to jacked-up superhero. His physical performance is on point, especially when ambulating haphazardly with crutches. Mr. Leto is reputedly a method actor, and one can’t tell how much assistance he receives from visual effects and makeup.  Despite its Marvel pedigree, “Morbius” has something of a cheap look. The production designer’s staged interpretation of New York City, where most of the action sequences take place, is dumpy and Oliver Wood’s green-tinted cinematography doesn’t help, as it precisely evokes the bargain horror/thriller aesthetic.  Dialogue is barely discernible in the terrible sound mix and the “Spider-Man”-esque final showdown between Dr. Morbius and Milo is utterly forgettable in light of previous films, “No Way Home” included.  The most interesting bit is in the epilogue, when Michael Keaton appears as Adrian Toomes, otherwise known as Vulture. Director Daniel Espinosa seems unable to contain his glee at having the former DC Batman in the Marvel “bat”-man film, not even waiting for the end credits to finish rolling before flaunting his scenes.  Mr. Tsai is a film critic with bylines in The New York Sun, Los Angeles Times, and many others.

"Apr 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"  Sony's Marvel universe has kicked off its 2022 slate of feature films with Morbius, starring Jared Leto as the titular Dr. Michael Morbius. The film experienced multiple delays due to the pandemic. It was originally meant to be released in March 2021 and then in October of the same year and now, finally, a full year after its initial release date, it is finally seeing the light of day. And let me be the one to say: I could have happily waited another decade.   Dr. Michael Morbius is a famed genius doctor who specializes in blood diseases, having concocted life-saving synthetic blood that has apparently saved more lives than penicillin. His research is fueled by his own condition, a rare blood disease that affects his ability to walk, which leads him to rely on crutches for mobility. He’s also inspired by his best friend, Milo (Matt Smith), whom he met in a hospital when they were both children and who suffers the same affliction. When Morbius makes a breakthrough in his research — successfully extracting DNA from a bat and attaching it to another animal — he and his work partner and fellow doctor, Martine (Adria Arjona), carry out the experiment. Obviously, it doesn't go to plan.   Similar to the inception of the Green Goblin, Michael wakes up in the lab as a murderous superhuman vampire. His face is transformed into a terrifying creature with long fangs and sharp claw-like nails. He can move at superhuman speed, crawl ceilings, and fly. There’s just one catch: he needs to consume blood every six hours. When Milo catches word of this, he turns himself into the same creature — but because he drinks human blood rather than synthetic like Michael, he has an even more nefarious side. The rest of the film sees the pair duke it out as Michael tries to stop himself from fully indulging in his monstrous side, walking the line between hero and villain.   With Marvel churning out content like a cow produces milk, it's been hard to believe how they still bring fresh and nuanced stories to the table — like Spider-Man: No Way Home or Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. However, the superhero studio has finally caught up with itself in its latest tandem release with Sony, as Morbius is one of its most stale, unoriginal, and forgettable outings. From start to finish, the film feels completely rushed. We get barely any backstory into the protagonist we are meant to empathize with through the entire picture. We know little about Dr. Michael Morbius. The film tries to give us a character that we can identify with as he cares for young children and tries to cure his best friend, but it all feels like filler, just waiting for the action to start.   The first 30 minutes of the film rush through Milo and Michael’s meeting, Michael’s life up until this point, and his research into bat DNA, completely skipping the time between his childhood and present day, and relying on another character to briefly summarize those events. By now, we know that in order to root for the hero (or villain) is to know what makes them tick — their flaws, hopes, desires, insecurities, or any other minor details that make up this larger-than-life character. But for Michael, we are expected to go along with it because... he's a genius?   The central problem of Morbius is a lazy and uninspiring script. No weight or depth is given to any character. There’s little humor and when it tries to make a tongue-in-cheek joke, it fails miserably. Being a villain origin story of sorts, it’s fair to draw similarities with Venom. However, Morbius lacks all charm and devotion to its main character, hoping that lengthy action sequences and jarring images of Leto and Smith’s animated faces will make us forget about how poor the script is.   Morbius prioritizes action over substance, doing little to establish character arcs, dynamics, and backstories in favor of focusing on action sequences, fights, and flashy CGI. In terms of the supporting cast, Jared Harris, as Milo and Michael’s doctor and mentor Nicholas, gets barely any airtime, wasting what could have been an important father figure who can effectively inject some emotion into the film — as seen in the likes of Uncle Ben, or even DC's Alfred Pennyworth. Instead, he’s a useless bystander, never offering any wisdom or implementing so much as a moral code in Michael. Arjona gets the same treatment. Although the MCU has frequently welcomed a subversion to the classic damsel-in-distress character, offering love interests more personality and independence from the romance, Martine, unfortunately, falls away into the background — only present to ask Michael what his plans are and help in the lab but ultimately failing to bring any real weight to the story.   The friends-turned-enemy trope can be an interesting and compelling catalyst for action — it’s done with some degree of intensity in Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man 3. What works with Peter Parker and Harry Osborn's feud is that the trilogy took the time to establish the friendship of the pair. We saw Harry and Peter go from high-school best friends to romantic rivals to enemies, making the conclusive fight all the more heartbreaking. Morbius, on the other hand, doesn't bother to establish an authentic friendship between Michael and Milo. They have few scenes together before they are meant to be sworn enemies. Even at the end of the film, there’s little regret between the pair about how their friendship came apart, which begs the question: were they really friends at all? On the topic of enemies, Smith's Milo comes closer to resembling that creep in the corner of your local bar than an MCU bad guy. Villains work best when they're either terrifying or charming; Milo doesn't reach either side at all.   If I can praise anything about this film, it would be that Leto does feel somewhat comfortable in the role. Instead of letting the lazy writing wash over him, he does what he can with it. With Leto having a recent stream of flop performances as Joker and Paolo Gucci, Morbius may suggest that Leto works best in less eccentric roles. It's the first time we’ve seen the actor stripped down to the bones, with prosthetics and wigs far removed. Of course, he does play a monstrous vampire, but when he’s Michael, Leto knows he's the driving force of the film and uses it to his abilities.   In classic Marvel style, we know that this may not be the last time we’ll see Dr. Michael Morbius. If the post-credit kicker is to be believed, he's sure to pop up in other superhero vehicles and potentially have his own sequels. Despite Morbius being utterly forgettable, I have hope that if the character is given the right care and attention, an interesting antihero could rise from the narrative ashes of his solo outing.

"Apr 2, 2022",NEUTRAL," Two years’ worth of delays should generate hype for any film, but that hasn’t really been the case for Morbius. What should have been tantalising excitement was quickly substituted with exasperation. The end result is – unfortunately but perhaps predictably – nothing worth cheering for. Morbius may have an intriguing idea at its core, but it fails to make the most of the tools at its disposal.  In a typical superhero story of pseudoscience gone mad, Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) is a brilliant but elusive scientist who suffers from a rare and debilitating blood condition. As he tries to find a cure for himself and for his best friend and fellow sufferer, Milo (Matt Smith), Morbius inadvertently turns himself into a living vampire who requires blood to survive. Granted superhuman speed and strength, and the ability to use echolocation, he desperately wrestles for control over his bloodlust before anyone else gets hurt. The film starts off strong, setting up a compelling dynamic between Michael and Milo based in their shared childhood experiences; but things quickly fall apart from there. Morbius’ supporting cast have their talents wasted by a script that seems uninterested in them. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) gets to tell off an arrogant mercenary who assumes she’s a nurse rather than a doctor, but that’s her only real moment of note, otherwise existing solely as a device to facilitate Morbius’ full transformation. Smith gets to ham it up as Milo in detestably groovy fashion, but strip away the entertainment façade and all you are left with is another disabled Hollywood character who’s embittered against the world. The film has little time for anyone bar its protagonist. Speaking of whom, Leto may not have a particularly shining reputation in Hollywood, yet for all of Morbius’ (many) problems, it’s hard to deny his efforts here. Aside from when he’s tearing various people a new one, Leto’s performance is quiet and almost sensitive, a welcome change from the deranged theatrics that characterise many of his other films. He elegantly telegraphs Morbius’ guilt and regret at his actions – that is, until the film’s close, when the character suddenly changes his mind for no apparent reason. Leto also nails one crucial aspect; he unmistakably looks the part, especially when in full vampire form. The decision to use CGI over prosthetics has seemingly paid off. Everything else, however, comes up lacking. Morbius struggles to achieve any real traction, hopping between hero origin story, horror movie and action flick without meaningfully committing to any. The visuals used to accentuate Morbius’ powers are distinctive, but rarely successful. The climactic showdown in particular suffers badly; in many of the shots featured in the final ten minutes of the film, it is damn near impossible to follow the action amidst the flying debris and wispy purple smoke. The story and its presentation also leave a lot to be desired: it doesn’t make sense for Morbius to apparently master his new abilities right away, and background characters are left with little to do other than watch and gawp (particularly Tyrese Gibson’s FBI Agent).  The end result is bland and unengaging; neither smart enough to make you think nor fun enough to make you smile. The latter point is a particular let down. If Venom: Let There Be Carnage took Sony’s new wave of Marvel films into a delightfully absurd direction, Morbius very much sits alongside The Batman as a gloomy mood killer of a film, except without any semblance of quality. The film lacks the gravitas, energy or execution to make it worth seeing, as well as being a disappointing waste of one of Marvel’s coolest characters. Leto does not pull the detestable, overdramatic creep stunt that you might be expecting, but that is the only pleasant surprise on offer. Between the lack of atmosphere, underdeveloped characters and questionable visuals, Morbius just doesn’t know how to hold its audience’s attention. It isn’t even much fun."
"Apr 2, 2022",NEUTRAL," Jared Leto trades in his clown shoes for fangs – and, of course, it’s as silly and bad as you thought. However, it’s never not entertaining, and Matt Smith understood the assignment. Oddly enough, I went into Morbius with the exact mentality of Zendaya’s words. I had a familiarity with the character going into the new movie (thanks, '90s Spider-Man cartoon show), but the film's trailer admittedly did not sink its teeth into my attention. It just looked like a goofy flick made 20-plus years ago, one where the special effects and dialogue are off. And yeah, Morbius is that. It reminded me of 2004’s Van Helsing: You know it’s not good, but you’re never not entertained. So, I can’t drive a stake through this. I enjoyed myself. Rather than kick things off like a horror movie (like it should have), the basic thrust of the plot is celebrity biochemist Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) is in search of a cure for his rare, enervating blood disease. He travels across the world to find vampire bats, so he can simply inject himself with their DNA. Like a classic superhero/villain accident, Michael is imbued with pseudo-vampiric superhuman abilities and physical traits. This means he needs blood every few hours to keep his six-pack and well-oiled body.  Things become even more complicated for Michael when his bestie, Milo (a scene-stealing Matt Smith of Doctor Who fame), wants in on the action. Milo suffers from the same disease, but Michael doesn’t want Milo to face the consequences of not being able to control his thirst. Naturally, this creates a rift, and the results get bloody. Right out of the coffin, how Morbius is shot and how the actors talk is abysmal. It’s a CGI overload splattered with nonsensical dialogue that delivers too much exposition. But there’s an amusing quality to it. Morbius isn’t a complete guilty pleasure watch. There’s some legitimately good stuff in here. Let’s begin with Matt Smith. Clearly, he’s the one performer who understood the assignment and didn’t try to take this super serious like the other actors. He dances to sexy hip-hop music and has a charm that mirrors Kiefer Sutherland in The Lost Boys. He even says Michael’s name over and over just like Sutherland’s fanged baddie. Smith tears up every scene he’s in, and it’s a hoot. There are also neat warp effects whenever Michael moves about in his vampiric form. It’s like he’s a Death Eater in Harry Potter. But instead of leaving a slight trail of black smoke, Michael paints all the colors of the wind, primarily purple. It’s like a watercolor painting to watch. So, for that, those rendered effects deserve a round of applause.  Morbius can be enjoyed if you enter with the right mindset. It never really had that much potential, so I cannot grade it as seriously with my red pen. If I did, this movie would be covered. Maybe I was in a forgiving mood. Regardless, this is a comfortable sit that’s less than two hours, and that’s a win in my book.

"Apr 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"
Occasionally, it's not as ghastly as it might sound, mostly thanks to Leto's general gravitas and a supervillain (Matt Smith from ""The Crown"") thoroughly enjoying his own personal discoveries."
"Apr 2, 2022",NEGATIVE," Lisa Johnson Mandell’s Morbius review says that there were high hopes for the stellar cast and Marvel/Spiderman pedigree, but this modified vampire villain flick quickly bleeds out. In the opening scene of Morbius, we see Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) and a crew landing a helicopter in a lush jungle. They seem very eager for Morbius to do whatever business he has quickly, so they can get out of their before sunset. Morris walks up to a cave entrance and slashes his palm, presumably to use his own blood as bait for the vampire bats within. It works like a charm. Everything including the helicopter is suddenly overwhelmed by thousands of the dark winged creatures. We assume this opening scene will somehow be tied in with the rest of the film. We assume wrong. It’s never quite explained what exactly happened or how or when it fits in with the rest of  the story. There are a lot of instances like that in Morbius. It’s a bit like an inexpertly assembled jigsaw puzzle. While the overall picture is obvious, the individual pieces don’t fit into place, and after awhile, you stop caring. What we have is the anemic story of a brilliant doctor trying to find a cure for a mysterious blood disease that plagues him and his bestie. Vampire bats seem to have the answer, the only problem is, the batty treatment keeps them alive, but only as vicious creatures who feed off other people’s blood. The film’s failure is not for lack of trying by the talented leads. Gifted actors Leto, Matt Smith and Jared Harris shine, as always, and Adria Arjona is serviceable. They lend substance to an otherwise flimsy film. The special effects are also surprisingly lightweight for a Marvel flick. The endless morphing of human countenances into scary bat faces and guys running through the air trailing red and gray ribbons representing air currents that allow them to fly without wings—we were nonplused. Blame it on the editors, blame it on director Daniel Espinosa (Life, Easy Money) blame it on too much dependence on the Marvel Universe to carry it through, it ends up as a drained and lifeless attempt to start a new branch franchise. That cameo at the end with Michael Keaton returning as Spiderman foe Adrian Toomes, teasing a sequel? Don’t hold your breath. Lisa Johnson Mandell’s Morbius review says that there were high hopes for the stellar cast and Marvel/Spiderman pedigree, but this modified vampire villain flick quickly bleeds out.

"Apr 2, 2022",NEGATIVE," The filmmakers and corporations behind Sony’s Marvel Comics adaptation Morbius (★☆☆☆☆) have had ample time to consider what they’re aiming for with this big-budget film intro for living vampire, and vintage Spider-Man nemesis, Dr. Michael Morbius. Namely they should have figured out by now whether their version of the character — portrayed in astonishingly muted fashion by Oscar-winner and accent devourer Jared Leto — exists in any known Spider-Man film universe, or maybe one that’s merely Spidey-adjacent, à la Venom. After half a decade and at least seven release date delays, moviegoers and Marvel fans (not mutually exclusive) also have had ample time to try to make sense of every hint in the marketing, and every detail of speculation. But the murky, mundane origin story that director Daniel Espinosa and credited writing team Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless have come up with treats making sense more as a perk than a prerequisite, so dial down expectations accordingly. Ultimately, Morbius is a setup — a long-winded prologue to some prospective later franchise entry, teased in the two underwhelming mid-credits sequences that will prolong this experience for many who would otherwise be ready to bolt by then.  Strangely enough, the movie checks out first, practically stopping on a dime following a listless showdown between super-vampire-powered Morbius and friend-turned-foe Milo, played by past and perennial Dr. Who, Matt Smith.  Smith and the effects team appear from what’s onscreen to be the ones to have really sunk their teeth into the material. The CGI wizards make abundant use of the scary-Bilbo effect, famous from Peter Jackson’s LOTR films, toggling between actors’ bare faces and fearsome flashes of fangs-baring bloodsuckers. And Morbius’ super-fast, super-agile moves are trailed by a dark mist resembling a cloud of bats, his spirit animal.  Supplying the only compelling lead performance, Smith’s Milo registers as his own special effect. Milo, real name Lucien, first meets Michael Morbius at a children’s hospital, where both sickly boys are being treated for a rare blood disease. Morbius grows up to be a world-renowned hematologist, seen rejecting a Nobel Prize from the King and Queen of Sweden. Why does he show up to reject a Nobel Prize? Reasons. Where does adult Milo get the money to become the leading financial benefactor for Morbius’ Horizon Labs? Sorry, must have missed it. At Horizon, Morbius works alongside colleague/girlfriend Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) to seek a cure for the disease that’s slowly killing him and Milo. And, eureka, by fusing human blood with bat DNA, he discovers a cure, which leads to serious complications that will have Milo and Morbius at each other’s throats. That’s about it for plot, which meanders forward unencumbered by emotional complexity or engaging subplots. Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal play two FBI agents who literally just show up at crime scenes throughout the movie, adding zero to the action or story. Leto’s Morbius, supposedly driven beyond reasonable and ethical limits — when it’s time for human trials, he experiments on himself! — feels like he’s sleep-walking through his big debut. Drive is not this guy’s prevailing characteristic, nor romance with Arjona’s bland love interest, his prime mode for charming the audience. The slight touches of humor might be where the character most comes to life.  Often, otherwise, he’s just a pixelated figure flying past buildings. Actually, in one mid-credits scene, Leto and his scene partner look like they might have been Zoomed into their respective shots. Whatever it takes to open doors to more lucrative, cross-over universes, be they MCU, Venom-centered, X-related, or all of the above.  The brain trust behind this bust might have spent a lot of time thinking about how to bring together alternate superhero movie franchises, but they don’t seem to have put the same care and detailed attention into how this superhero movie was assembled.  ""It really started just as a Twitter joke,"" recalls filmmaker Vera Drew, of her boldly creative comic book movie spoof The People's Joker, a passion project largely inspired by the Oscar-winning 2019 Joker starring Joaquin Phoenix.

"Apr 2, 2022",NEUTRAL," ‘You wouldn’t like me when I’m hungry,’ warns Michael Morbius the Living Vampire; to be honest, I wasn’t that keen about this guy when he was fully fed and watered. Daniel Espinosa’s horror/thriller feels like on off-shoot from an off-shoot (the model is to ape the success of Venom from the Spiderman metaverse) and that origin story suggests inessential viewing. But although I’d never heard of the character before, Morbius has enough adult content to make it a bloody snack for hungry MCU fans to enjoy between their regular super-sized super-hero meals. As with Venom and Tom Hardy, Morbius sees a serious actor struggling for purchase in a comic-book world; Jared Leto at least carries some kind of broody mystique into his role as a NYC scientist with a rare blood disease searching for a cure by splicing his DNA with that supplied by lots of Costa Rican bats. This quest resolves itself in a conflict with surrogate brother and childhood friend Milo (yet another awful turn from Matt Smith), who gains the same bat-like powers as Morbius, putting them in direct competition for precious supplies of the anticoagulant serum that will allow them to harness their super-powers; there’s a nice shot of Morbius coasting the down-draft from a subway train like the bats he steals DNA from. Plugs for Monster energy drinks tell you exactly what arrested development audience Morbius is aimed at; despite aspirations to Cronenbergian body-horror, Morbius’s bloody action amounts to a lengthy thin-off between Leto and Smith, two performers who love to let their skeletal physique do the heavy lifting. Also along for the ride are rando ingredients like Jared Harris, The Jam’s A Town Called Malice, jokes about The Notebook (yet again) and the usual mid-credits tie in to other movies in the form of a brief cameo from Michael Keaton’s Spiderman villain. What Morbius resembles closely is the MCU’s more familiar blood-sucking character Blade with a transforming good vampire who fights bad vampires for synthetic blood to retain his less destructive form. As a film, the much delayed and reshot Morbius is too dark and dank in tone to ever have had strong appeal to the family audience that often turns out for super-hero extravaganzas, but it’s of-a-piece with the lightweight Venom movies, passable, forgettable entertainment for easily-pleased teenage boys. When Morbius is challenged about his changing physical appearance, he quips in confidence ‘pilates helps’, and a few bursts of that kind of self-deprecating humour just about keeps this silly ship afloat. I liked the comics. Thought this had the potential to be, not a gamechanger, but at least something a notch above the usual superhero dreck. But sounds like we’ve been here before many, many, many times. Infinity War ended things for me, I did a couple of the new Spider-Man movies and the first Venom and even The Eternals but none match the Avengers series for me and I can’t be arsed with any of them anymore. Nope. There was a little bit of magic in the Avengers ensemble and a script & cast that gave the characters some depth, it wasn’t all about the CGI,plus they were funny. Missed all that in the new stuff. Yeah, I’m on the same boat as Fraggle. I was done with the MCU after the Infinity War duology. I did watch the second spiderman movie and at some point I’ll probably watch the third one, but that’s not a given like it used to be.
So this is not something I’m even remotely interested in. I have a feeling audiences will agree with your sentiments…. I’d have to check out the dates, but at least in the comics, I think Morbius might pre-date Blade.
And given how the last blade movie went and the public actions by Snipes, I don’t see Blade being popular again for quite a whiile. Thought Morbius was okay.  Interesting enough concept and well done in places. Surprised to hear it had terrible reviews. It’s not mainstream MCU but I thought that was the whole point. Leto had enough of the baleful to make the character work but i am getting fed up with the Matt Smith slouch and quiff.  Had to remind myself who the hell Michael Keaton was in the MCU scheme of things. Smith is just lousy in everything; I wondered if I’d provoke some offence from a fan by slagging him, but seemingly there’s no defending him. Not as bad as the critics say in general, old Morbius. Sonic was a bust. The first one I enjoyed, a nice mixture of playful and unexpected and Jim Carrey a good villain. This was all over the shop, two new characters, a wedding (!) and I certainly felt uncomfortable at the appearance of comic Russians. Seems to have taken off at the British box office, well ahead of Morbius and doing far better than Ambulance, so what do I know? No, it’s just the usual yardsticks are out the window. So strange to have Pixar going straight to streaming and Sonic 2 cleaning up. Hard to compute. Morbius has just about doubled its budget at the box office … as eye-rolling as the concept of a cinematic universe made up of just “Spider-Man” villains is, Sony’s plan is working, though I do think the Kraven the Hunter film will be the make-or-break point of this weird offshoot of Marvel. And there’ll be waves of nostalgia years from now when they bring back Morbius, whether he became a franchise or not, and have three different actors playing three different Morbius’s, just wake me up when it’s all over. If they tried making stand-alone movies with stand-alone characters, I’d be mroe interested…their plan may work, but I dodn’t have to go along with it!

"Apr 2, 2022",NEGATIVE," In Bram Stoker’s original novel, the foreign, perverse Dracula is almost universally read to stand in for immigrants, queer people and Jews. When asked to choose sides, you rooted for the virtuous British heroes, not the bloodsucking count. In the new Marvel superhero film “Morbius,” the vampire is the good guy. What he is not, however, is a champion of the marginalized. Although Dracula has long represented the outsider, Morbius spends the whole film trying to be more normal. Brilliant doctor Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) has a rare condition that leaves him weak, barely able to walk and in constant need of blood transfusions. So he dedicates his life to studying this disorder and defeating it. He first develops artificial blood, which saves millions of lives but doesn’t cure his own illness. Then, because this is a superhero movie, he turns to splicing human and bat DNA. Experiments, as you’d expect, go awry. And before you can say “origin story,” he’s a superpowered bat creature that needs to feed on blood. In addition to the connection to illness and disability, vampires in “Morbius” are also coded as queer. As a child, Morbius becomes close friends with another similarly afflicted boy, named Milo (Matt Smith). We see Milo early in the film being badly bullied by a group of boys who target him in part because he’s weak and can’t walk. But they also come after him because he’s reading what is essentially a love letter sent by Morbius. The explicit queer bashing gives a pointed, painful edge to Milo’s repeated insistence to Morbius that “we are the few against the many.” It also colors Milo’s obvious jealousy of Morbius’ co-researcher and romantic interest, Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona). Milo helps fund Morbius’ efforts to find a cure for both of them. But while Morbius is horrified by the bloodlust caused by his “cure,” Milo embraces it. “I’m not ashamed of what I am!” he declares. And he tries to convince Morbius he shouldn’t be ashamed, either. The separatist supervillain is a common trope, from Magneto of the “X-Men” franchise to Killmonger in “Black Panther.” Often the script will acknowledge that the bad guy has a point — mutants are oppressed in “X-Men” stories, Black people are oppressed in ""Black Panther"" (and in real life). Magneto and Killmonger seek excessive revenge, we’re supposed to think, but their call for justice has some merit. Milo isn’t accorded that much sympathy. The movie doesn’t acknowledge its LGBTQ themes or how disability is compounded by the callousness of adults, as well as the bullying of children. Milo’s rants are just rants; we’re not supposed to see his complaints as having any merit. Morbius does occasionally admit that being superstrong is fun, and he has a bond with bats. There are scenes when he’s flying amid all the CGI gunk that the story seems to be reaching — ineffectually, but still — for a lyrical celebration of weird queer goth transcendence. But those moments are fleeting and underdeveloped. Morbius never talks to Milo about the experiences they share as vampires or contemplates the way marginalization has shaped him. He just wants to be normal and hetero and settle down with Martine. You don’t cheer for Morbius the vampire. You root for Morbius to defeat the vampire within — symbolized by Milo. This lack of sympathy is especially frustrating because in many ways, it’s never been a better time to be a vampire (at least culturally). Anne Rice, Stephenie Meyer and numerous other writers have created romantic, appealing vampires who suggest, to one degree or another, that Bram Stoker was wrong about Dracula and that marginalized people aren’t inherently an evil parasitic threat. The most obvious example in this context is that other Marvel vampire film, “Blade,” starring Wesley Snipes. The film played with negative stereotypes linking Black people with addiction. But it also celebrated Blade’s outsider status. He’s a hero because he’s Black and because he’s a vampire, not despite those things. Like Milo, he’s not ashamed. “Morbius,” then, is a superhero story about defeating outsiders and monsters, rather than a story about how those outsiders and monsters can be heroes or about how we should maybe rethink our definitions of heroes and monsters. I guess that’s what Morbius wanted. But Milo deserved better."
"Apr 1, 2022",POSITIVE," Renowned biochemist Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) tries to cure himself of a rare blood disease, but he inadvertently infects himself with a form of vampirism instead. The remedy is potentially worse than the disease. An anti-hero like Venom, Morbius premiered as an original comic book character in 1971, from Roy Thomas and Gil Kane, and for the uninitiated, he’s a Spider-Man villain. But we don’t get very far into the Spider-verse – except in the two mid-credit scenes to tip us off as to what’s ahead. Like nearly all film adaptations of comic books, we’re left with a cliffhanger ending so that we’ll anticipate “Morbius 2.” And like all blockbusters that set up CGI showdowns as a grand finale, they unleash a torrent of rock-em, sock-em special visual effects that we are more familiar with than not. Those bombastic, repetitive confrontations always go on way too long and tend to wear out their welcome with me. But the razzle-dazzle is a big part of the appeal to their massive fan base. As in all films, I prefer the storytelling – the power to move us, to show us different perspectives, a new world. Why do the Avengers have such staying power? They aim for the heart with their human relationships besides the shiny ‘save the world’ pyrotechnics. Because I knew nothing about this character and was not a reader of Marvel Comics in my youth, I’m coming into these movies with an open mind. It’s my first opportunity to learn of this “Living Vampire” and his desperate measures to come up with a cure for the rare blood disorder he and his best buddy Milo (Matt Smith) have endured since they were roommates at a special home for chronically ill children. The Marvel Cinematic Universe as we know it has produced 20 movies in about 15 years, and shows no signs of slowing down, even though we’re in a different phase – and television series have been developed too from movie characters. The MCU is a well-oiled machine, but besides its affiliation with Disney, “Spider-Man” was a property of Sony (Columbia Pictures). It’s a tad sticky, and lawyers got involved, so this may be way it doesn’t look or feel like the usual fare – and has only a passing connection to “Spider-Man: No Way Home.” We’re familiar with the high-profile superheroes – Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Incredible Hulk, Black Widow and Black Panther, but have been introduced to Ant-Man, Dr. Strange, Hawkeye and Falcon, and more the past decade. “Venom” arrived in 2018 and its sequel, “Venom: Let There Be Carnage,” last year. Venom is a sentient alien symbiote with an amorphous, liquid-like form, who must bond with a host to survive. That poor soul was Eddie Brock, as played by Tom Hardy, who received enhanced powers in exchange for a life of mayhem. The character first arrived as a villain in a Spider-Man comic in 1984, then as “Venom” in 1987. In “Morbius,” because the bat DNA serum injected by Dr. Morbius causes both substantial physical healing but dire bloodthirsty consequences – survival means drinking blood – there is the dual nature of the consequences. The good doctor doesn’t want to hurt people, while his best pal Milo lusts after the new reign of terror. This film is made better because of the quality of its main actors. Leto, Oscar winner for “Dallas Buyers Club,” has been impressive the past two years – the creepy suspect Albert Parma in “The Little Things,” the hapless Paolo in “House of Gucci,” and as Adam Neumann in the limited series “We Crashed.” (Notice I am not mentioning his subpar Joker in 2016 “Suicide Squad,” but he did fare better in the 2021 Zack Snyder “Justice League” cut). Leto brings out the tortured nature of his brilliant physician-scientist character. He and the fine British character actor Matt Smith, most known for “Doctor Who” and “The Crown,” forge an authentic bond as the isolated kids turned damaged adults -- ‘the few against the many,’ (comparing themselves to the Spartans from childhood on to adult life). Milo, still a shut-in, has amassed a fortune that funds Morbius’ work and unethical experiments. Another strong character actor, Jared Harris, is their benevolent mentor who saw Morbius’ potential as a child. Standing out is Adria Adjona as Dr. Morbius’ lab partner/love interest Dr. Martine Bancroft, an actress you want to see more of in the future. Screenwriters Matt Shazama and Burk Sharpless merely set up the origin story that leads to the conflicts that are the staple to the story – we’re not in the same league as Dark Knight’s Christopher Nolan here. But the quality of the actors are genuine. The best aspect may be the seamless transformation of the characters between their real selves and the demons that are summoned – those slick visual effects are stunning in execution. While “Morbius” isn’t going to satisfy all tastes, the filmmakers have introduced a character that’s worth finding more about – if there are successful films. And in the Marvel universe, even if this isn’t the Disney wing, all things are possible."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," “Morbius, The Living Vampire” is one of those third tier Spider-Man villains who were never quite iconic, but also never someone you could write off as a lightweight. While he originated with Spider-Man he fit more in to the horror corner of the Marvel universe, and much like Marvel, his feature film debut doesn’t really know what to do with him, exactly. The movie audiences never seem to lose their appetites for stylish vampire movies, and “Morbius” had franchise written all over him to where could have served as an unofficial companion to the “Blade” movie series. It’s hard to believe that Sony could get “Morbius, the Living Vampire” so wrong from the gate. Oscar winner Jared Leto transforms into the enigmatic antihero Michael Morbius. Dangerously ill, and born with a rare blood disorder that has held him back his entire life, and determined to save others suffering his same fate, Dr. Morbius attempts a desperate gamble at using bats’ blood to help cure the rare blood disease. While at first it seems to be a radical success, a vampiric darkness inside him is unleashed. With Morbius struggling to fight his blood thirst, he has to face the terrible repercussions of his experiment gone awry, especially after being framed for murdering a nurse. Sony, like every other major studio, seems to have franchise aspirations for Morbius, even propping him up for entry in to the Spider-Man films. But they seem to lose all faith in the final hour, resulting in a dreadful film that has a vague connection to Spider-Man. I say vague because if you know he’s from Spider-Man, then the work is all done. “Morbius” is a painfully boring, listless, tedious (slightly ableist) horror action film that never quite knows where it wants to go. It aims for body horror, themes about god complex; then it’s a Frankenstein tale, a Gothic romance, and a man learning to embrace his vampiric urges. There’s also a tale about two lifelong friends, both of whom have vastly different ideas about what they want to do with their newfound abilities and physical form. Jared Leto literally sleepwalks through “Morbius” offering a performance as the titular character that is so one dimensional and bland, it’ll be tough to root for him. Even at his most vulnerable. Compensating for the sheer lack of enthusiasm is Matt Smith who is very good in the role as a character that is… or may not be… the film’s central villain. The writers never decided, even in the final scenes. They also jump in and out of the quite obvious homoerotic overtones between Smith and Leto’s characters. The writers work over time to push back on the obvious themes mid-way with a dull tacked on romantic sub-plot with Adria Arjona’s character. As for any other characters, you feel instantly bad for Tyreese and AJ Madrigal, both of whom play hard boiled detectives chasing down Morbius. They have no real purpose in the film, contribute nothing but the obligatory obstacle, and sadly only show up for three short scenes just to remind us that they’re there. “Morbius” is just down right awful from top to bottom. It feels like a movie plucked right out of 2004 (no soundtrack by Mudvayne or Godsmack), and oddly enough made me long for the “Underworld” movie series, which are also terrible, but at least charismatic and charming."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,"In short, going for the vampiric pun youd expect, this sucks."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," “Morbius” is the most elaborate practical joke in history, and we are the butt of that joke, you and I. Because I’ve actually seen “Morbius,” I am likely more of a butt than you. Peter denied Jesus three times before the cock crowed, and “Morbius” was delayed 6 times before crowds got cold cocked. Coincidence? Not when you consider how biblically bad the film is. The opening and closing credits sport graphics that legitimately look like early a rejected early-2000s screensaver, if that tells you where to set the bar. Little orphaned Michael Morbius is a genius with a mysterious blood disease. In addition to killing him, the disease presumably also strips him of any identifiable personality traits. He gets older and becomes Jared Leto, arguably the worst thing that can happen to a person. As an adult, Mikey Mo is a chemist-scientist-doctor who looks through microscopes to search for his charisma (and a cure for his condition). Then it comes to him: Bats! He liquifies a vampire bat pancreas and injects it in order to change his DNA. Several members of congress actually believe that science checks out. He becomes a vampire. This is one of those movies where nobody says “Holy shit, you turned yourself into a vampire!” As if that wouldn’t be the very first thing someone yells. I have accidentally yelled that at a few people who were just really pale and bored. Dr. Acula is torn because, on the one hand, he likes having abs and not dying. On the other, drinking human blood is still frowned upon, am I right, Armie Hammer? Anyway, the bad guy’s origin may be a spoiler, so just trust that conflict occurs and some solidly C-minus level special effects work is vomited on the screen. It culminates in two post-credits scenes that are so laughably, demoralizingly bad that it feels like a parody of the practice. Post-credits scenes are now dead at the hands of Jared Leto. He’s killed before, and he’ll kill again. An interesting choice: Every fight sequence or use of superpowers in “Morbius” is done under a fart cloud. Some may say it’s “vampire mist” or “puff of smoke,” but I know a plume of flatulence when I see it. Everything, every last tiny little aspect, in “Morbius” is uninspired, shallow, and dull. Actually, that’s not fair. Matt Smith does a kooky pajama dance in the middle that is a brief, 30-second delight. The film would have been better if it were worse because then it may have inspired some kind of meaningful reaction instead of just bleeding our finite lifespan. I don’t know if this is clear, but I don’t care for Jared Leto. He isn’t even “bad” here so much as he is the most passive version of his obnoxious self. Reports did, once again, detail his method acting and refusal to come out of character. Michael Morbius is a Nobel-award winning scientist. Did Leto cure a hematologic disorder? No, he was just a real big jerk to his costars again. I dare someone to cast the dude in a role where he plays a nice, quiet, humble fella and then keep pushing the production of film as long as he keeps buying it. Anyway, “Morbius” finally came out on April Fool’s Day for a reason: Because some trickster God made me a comic book fan decades ago so that one day I would have to see a Spider-Man adjacent film with Jared F’n Leto in it. You win this round, Anansi, Loki, or whoever at Sony flushed like $100 million to ruin my day. Wenlei Ma at News.Com.Au says “If the movie gods had any mercy, they would’ve killed off every character so they can never come back in a sequel.” MontiLee Stormer at MovieReelist.com says “Its frenetic pace may not make it a must-own in any medium, but it’s a more than passable popcorn flick. It’s not a movie everyone will love, but I can think of worse movies to watch that don’t look nearly as good.” Jenny Heaton at Alternative-Lens.com says “I thought it wasn’t possible to make a vampire movie this dull, but accomplishing that dubious feat is the only original thing ‘Morbius’ succeeds in.”"
"Apr 1, 2022",POSITIVE,"A mediocre mixed bag of a 90s B movie that, despite its many flaws, represents an acceptable introduction to Jared Leto's anti-hero.  "
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,"At this point, I think it's fair to say that any comic book character that has even the most remote stink of Spider-Man on them is fair game for a film adaptation (I'm looking at you, Venom movies), whether they deserve one or not. "
"Apr 1, 2022",POSITIVE,"Geez everybody, calm down. There is an essential question about the bodily handicaps in the story, which gives it some heft ... what is one willing to give away to get cured of a disease thats essentially a living death? Disgust for drinking blood? Cool."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," Some of the best vampire “transitioning” effects ever are wasted on “Morbius,” perhaps the least interesting and certainly the least consequential action picture ever to wear the Marvel badge. Jared Leto isn’t awful in the title role. But aside from the effects, everything and everyone around him is indifferent and dull and he proves himself once again as more suited to chewy supporting roles than a lead.  Michael Morbius and the rich kid Lucien, whom re-names “Milo,” met in a Greek sanitarium for children of wealth and the rarest of the rare blood diseases, one that requires a transfusion or two every day to keep them alive. Morbius, plainly a genius, is sent away to school where he vows to “find the cure” for them both. But while we catch up with the adult Michael as he’s refusing his Nobel Prize, probably for inventing artificial blood, he hasn’t yet figured out how to correct the faulty DNA that keeps him and Milo (the least interesting recent “Doctor Who,” Matt Smith) weak and on crutches. “Bats” might be the answer, and no, he didn’t get that idea from Bruce Wayne. Vampire bats from the Jurassic Park corner of Costa Rica provide the serum that Morbius takes as the first “human trial” on an offshore Panamanian-flagged freighter. That turns out to be bad news for the hired goons/minions on board. It’s bad enough that the good doctor’s scientist/colleague (Adria Arjona) doesn’t know how to pronounce “NoBEL” (Director Daniel Espinosa didn’t get another take?), but for evil henchmen, these mercenary minions seem awfully eager to pull the trigger on their supposed meal ticket. It’s to no avail. Morbius, transformed to something just this side of “sleeping in coffins,” slaughters them and makes his way back to New York, cursed and yet ethical enough to see that nobody else should try this stuff as he enlists Dr. Bancroft (Argjona) to elude the mustachioed FBI agents (Tyrese Gibson, Al Madrigal) on the case. And Morbius must also fend off the rich financier of his experiments — “Milo” — hellbent on availing himself of this hellish “cure” he’s paid for. A hallmark of many of the less enduring or endurable comic book adaptations is their humorlessness, and “Morbius” is a case in point. The best gag (perhaps from the comic book) is the name of the Panamanian freighter, “Murnau,” the director of the first important vampire movie, “Nosferatu,” F.W. Murnau. Letolocks is not just about the dreamy eyes and  Reagan/Elvis dye jobs. He’s has made it his business to build on the “Method” legend of DeNiro and make his body over for roles. Here, he’s hollow-eyed and emaciated as pre-“transformation” Morbius, chiseled and “cut” afterwards. That’s not why this movie sat on a shelf for so long, waiting for him to beef up or starve himself down. It’s a Marvel picture and there was a pandemic going on so there was no sense leaving money on the table by releasing it to empty cinemas. But I can’t remember a Marvel movie that went to less trouble giving us an “origin story,” that put more effort into tying the tale into this corner of the Marvel “universe,” and that had less going for it.  Morbius isn’t a Marvel movie. It’s about a Marvel character, but it was made by Sony Pictures, not Marvel Studios. Which is why it sucks so much."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," Do you remember the terrible movie based on the Fantastic Four comics? No, not the recent abomination with Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan. I'm talking about the 1994 version. If you don't remember it, that's okay since it was never officially released. The story behind it is one of Hollywood's most infamous tales, covered in a documentary titled Doomed: The Untold Story of Roger Corman's The Fantastic Four. Why do I bring this up in a review for an unrelated comic book movie, you may be wondering? Well, Morbius might have more in common with The Fantastic Four then you'd think. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) is a renowned scientist who has been working his whole life to find a cure to the rare blood disease he suffers from. His research is backed by his surrogate brother, Milo (Matt Smith), who also suffers from the same disease. Morbius is also assisted in the experiments by Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona). Morbius might finally have a breakthrough with a serum derived from vampire bats. He tests it on himself, and while it does cure his disease, it also gives him the supernatural abilities associated with vampires, but without the superstitious weaknesses. He does have one weakness, though: The thirst for human blood. Knowing the dangers of this ""cure,"" he refuses to let Milo have it. This, of course, doesn't stop Milo from stealing some and taking it himself. Unlike Morbius, who tries to keep his thirst at bay with the artificial blood he invented, Milo fully embraces the bloodlust. With the bodies piling up around the city, FBI agents Stroud (Tyrese Gibson) and Rodriguez (Al Madrigal) end up on their trail. The Fantastic Four was an example of someone owning the film rights to a property and doing everything they could to keep them, even if that meant cobbling together a movie with zero intention of it seeing the light of day. Morbius is part of a handful of Marvel characters stuck in a similar situation and, after becoming the most delayed release of the COVID era, maybe it shouldn’t have made it to theaters, either. If you aren’t familiar with what is now apparently being called the Sony Spider-Man Universe, or SSU, allow me to give you a crash course. When the first Tobey Maguire Spider-Man was made, Sony had acquired the rights in a trade with MGM for Casino Royale, and the whole concept of the MCU wasn’t on anyone’s mind. Thus, ever since Marvel decided to start making their own movies, they and Sony have been caught in a legal miasma involving Marvel getting to “borrow” Spidey, but certain of the sub-characters within his universe belong to Sony. This is why we got two Venom movies with no connection to Spider-Man, and how we ended up with Morbius. Even more than it did with Venom, Morbius feels like Sony desperately trying to cling onto a potential money-making franchise. It’s not a good movie, but it’s also not a terrible movie. It’s a meh movie, at best. It’s not very exciting, the action is simply there and the characters are never allowed to connect with the audience, so we keep wondering why we should care about any of this. Some of Morbius’ powers make sense, but others do not. Also, the attempts to shoehorn in connections to what has been going on currently in the MCU and with their version of Spidey feel too contrived and open the gates to Plot Hole City. The actors’ performances feel like they were all too aware that what they were doing was ultimately absurd. It never seems like any of them were having fun. Sure, its story is darker than the average comic book film, but the audience should still get the idea that the actors enjoyed their work. Smith tries during one particular scene designed to demonstrate how happy Milo is about finally feeling good, but even that moment comes off as forced.

"Apr 1, 2022",NEUTRAL," Movie struggles with whether the serum is a gift or a curse: It provides great power but also requires a high price. Eventually both hero and villain partake, with no real consequences either way. In the end, everything thorny that the movie brings up is merely ignored or smoothed over. Michael Morbius is arguably the hero, or perhaps an anti-hero, but the fact that he kills a bunch of people is largely overlooked. Ultimately, it appears that he plans to keep on going, presumably drinking real blood to survive. All diverse representation is in supporting cast, as movie focuses on two White men. Black and Latino police officers, a Latina doctor who assists Morbius, a helpful nurse who's a woman of color (no specifics of her background are given), and a young Black girl who's one of Morbius' patients (though she's put into a coma and forgotten about for the rest of the movie). Biting, slashing with claws. Some blood shown, including spatters. Gurgling noises. Characters die, dead bodies. Guns and shooting. Bullies kick a child. Child hits bully in the head with crutch. A woman is shoved; she hits her head and is knocked unconscious. Jump scare. Parents need to know that Morbius is a comic book movie based on a Marvel Comics character who first appeared as a Spider-Man villain. It takes place in the same universe as Venom and Venom: Let There Be Carnage, and, like those films, is rather flat and uninspired. Violence can be intense and includes monsters biting, slashing with claws, and fighting. Characters are killed, blood is shown, and there's gun use. Bullying kids try to beat up a young boy: They kick him, and he hits one of them in the head with his crutch. A woman who's shoved hits her head and is knocked unconscious. Language includes a few uses of ""s--t."" People kiss, and shirtless males are seen. Social/background drinking is shown: Adults sip martinis and drink shots in a bar. Characters also use hypodermic needles to inject a secret formula. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. In MORBIUS, Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) suffers from a rare blood disease and has spent his life looking for a cure. In the meantime, he's invented artificial blood that's saved countless lives. For a new experiment, he incorporates vampire bat blood. When he tests it on himself, the result is superhuman strength, speed, and other powers -- but also an unquenchable thirst for blood. The artificial blood slows the cravings, but it won't work forever. Meanwhile, Michael's childhood friend Milo (Matt Smith), who has the same disease, wants to take the cure despite Michael's warnings. Then a spate of killings sweeps the city: The victims are all drained of blood, and Michael is blamed. Can he set things right? Humorless and as flat and as uninspired as the Venom movies were, this by-the-numbers comic book action movie seems to be operating entirely on autopilot, ticking off plot boxes as it goes. Even the actors seem to be sleeping through their lines in Morbius -- not that there's anything worth hearing, anyway. What might have been deep discussions about life and death, good and evil, or power and weakness are kept strictly on the surface and solved without much bother or meaning. Moral implications are simply ignored. Action scenes are complicated by the strange decision to show vapor trails following the characters as they leap or are thrown across buildings, alleys, and subways. The choice makes everything look smeary, like a cover-up for potentially underwhelming effects. (Occasionally the movie pauses for a nifty Matrix-like slo-mo shot, which helps clarify things.) While Leto and Smith have the lion's share of Morbius' chunky-sounding dialogue, and while they try to keep hysterics to a minimum, it all comes off sounding more like reading than speaking. The rest of the cast has so little to do that they're barely worth mentioning. And a ""surprise"" that comes at the end is hardly that, given that the actor in question has been featured in trailers and in the film's credits. Its promise of more ""Morbius"" to come is less of a promise and more of a warning. Families can talk about Morbius' violence. How did it make you feel? Was it exciting? Shocking? What did the movie show or not show to achieve this effect? Why is that important?

"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," Over the last two very long years, nothing has been made more clear than the fact that the world we live in is devoid of constants. We know that the reality we say good night to when we go to bed could look drastically different — war, disease, climate change, death — by morning. Lurking before movies we actually pay to see in theaters, in between our favorite television shows, on our computers and in our phones pressed up against the YouTube videos we procrastinate with, the Morbius trailer has become an inevitability in many of our lives. This state of eternally “coming soon” was due to the numerous delays the movie has faced. Originally, Morbius was supposed to premiere in July of 2020, but was moved to March 2021, and then to October 2021, and finally April 2022. If Morbius was a person you were supposed to have a date with who kept postponing, at this point you’d both agree to just forget the other existed.  But Morbius is not a person, it is a superhero movie about a “living vampire” from the Marvel comic books, currently owned and heavily invested in by Sony Pictures — the studio behind the current Spider-Man and Venom movies. And because of film rights and intellectual property, it’s much more difficult and expensive to disappear Morbius. Directed by Daniel Espinosa and starring Jared Leto and his ageless face, Morbius asks the question: What if vampires weren’t fun? After 144 minutes of Morbius dimming the spark of my life force, I found the soulless answer. From its very first moment, Morbius seems a lot more fun than it will ever turn out to be. Michael Morbius is a genius doctor who has assembled a team of unnamed characters to travel, by helicopter, to Costa Rica’s Cerro de la Muerte, which translates into English as “The Mountain of Death.” We do not get much more information on how much killing the mountain has done. However, we do learn that Morbius is trying to capture a bunch of vampire bats to take home with him to New York City. He slices his palm open, blood drips down, and thousands of bats come shooting out of the cave trying to lick his pale little hand. It’s all egregiously silly when you start to realize that this is a never-ending stream of bats and that there’s no logical way that the swarm will all fit into Morbius’s tiny suitcase. Also, do vampire bats really swarm and frenzy like piranha? How is Morbius going to get through customs with literally tens of thousands of winged piranha? Does he have a plan to feed them? And if Morbius is apparently wealthy enough to go to Murder Mountain, Costa Rica, via private helicopter, why isn’t he outsourcing his bat problems? Doing things yourself is not a very smart or rich person thing to do. The actual explanation of his intentions with all these bats is a lot less entertaining — a letdown when you consider how campy this adventure is and how fun its cinematic cousins are.  After his bat procurement trip, Morbius’s fellow doctor and potential love interest Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) wants to know why he’s shunned the King of Sweden and the Nobel Prize, and why and how he managed to install a large glass pillar full of bats in the middle of their office. With exposition, flashbacks, and monologue masquerading as a conversation, Morbius explains to her that he has a terminal blood disease (something she presumably knows since she has been working with him for a very long time) and that he’s turned down the highest medical prize in the world and snubbed Sweden’s king because he needs to do secret, presumably illegal bat research. He’s hoping to find a cure for his own blood disease, not only for himself but his childhood best friend Milo (Matt Smith). Morbius thinks he can cure his condition by sequencing vampire bat DNA. He explains this by spending an extremely inappropriate length of time repeating the word “coagulants.” This monologue was presumably written to prove the character is Very Smart, but the overall effect is not unlike listening to someone try to get you to invest in cryptocurrency. Bancroft, mind you, just wanted to scold her coworker for rejecting the Nobel Prize, but after the scintillating dissertation on coagulants, she seems really convinced that rejecting the once-in-a-lifetime prize was the right thing to do. She doesn’t follow up with any questions about who installed the giant bat-quarium in their office. With the insinuation that human-bat DNA splicing is illegal in the US, Morbius explains to Milo and Bancroft, separately, that the experiment must be done in secrecy and in international waters. The international waters in question end up being a Panamanian cargo ship 12 miles off the coast of Long Island. One would think that a man who has just brought tens of thousands of blood-sucking bats into the US and installed a bat sanctuary without his coworker noticing would be competent enough at keeping secrets, but maybe Morbius just wants to be extra careful. Obviously, one doesn’t win a Nobel Prize by being careless. Compared to the great lengths that Morbius went to to reach Costa Rica’s Cerro de la Muerte, a jaunty sprint to the waters just beyond Fire Island seems a little silly, comical even.  In the bowels of the Panamanian cargo vessel, the experiment goes too well! The bat juice cures Morbius’s illness and somehow also gives him muscles and a tan. For a fleeting moment, Morbius looks like a sexy Jesus. Unfortunately, the bat potion also turns Morbius into a bloodthirsty bat-man, gnarling his fingers into huge claws, sharpening his face and nose into a snout, and twisting his mouth into a howling maw of fangs. In this form, he murders and exsanguinates his hired mercenaries on the rented Panamanian cargo ship.  No doubt, turning oneself into an horrendous-looking bat person who must consume fresh human blood is arguably the biggest oopsie that a Nobel Prize-winning doctor genius has ever committed. Morbius’s gimmick is that Morbius is now essentially a vampire, but without any tether to existing mythology. He’s not bothered by daylight or garlic, nor does he have aversions to Catholic iconography. But he is biologically bound to blood-drinking.  If Morbius consumes blood, he can maintain his hot and sexy human form and possess superhuman strength and speed. Morbius also says the bat-juice has given him echolocation, which is depicted as being able to hear conversations from miles away. If he doesn’t consume blood, he turns into the uncontrollable, screeching creature, and becomes a danger to everyone around him. I’m not sure I would attribute super strength or speed to bats, nor am I fully convinced that echolocation means being a really good eavesdropper (traditionally, it’s being able to use sound to identify the location of objects). That said, I’m not a chiropterologist, i.e., a scientist who studies bats, a term I had to Google. If the movie takes some generous liberties when it comes to bat physiology, sure, fine. Instead of using his new muscles to take thirst traps, bench press cars, or even fight crime, Morbius piously uses these gifts to study aggressively. Imagine being so scorchingly beautiful and strong, and just wanting to research for all eternity. Couldn’t be me. He dictates all his symptoms into a recording device. He writes all of his findings into a notebook. He uses a stopwatch to time how long he can last before needing to consume blood — the artificial blood Morbius invented keeps him sustained, but organic, free-range human blood makes him stronger. Without any explanation, Morbius’s preferred method of blood consumption is shotgunning bags of blood like someone intent on obliterating their brain cells with cheap beer, another moment that would be funny in any movie other than Morbius. Milo doesn’t want to die. Milo also wants to be hot. Milo, furthermore, wants to drink tequila and live deliciously. Milo is honestly a lot more fun, if rooted in impulsiveness, which results in the murders of finance bros and cops (if the movie were the slightest bit aware of who it was skewering, I would call this satire). Milo’s rising body count puts the city on alert for a “vampire murderer” which seems hilariously redundant, but nonetheless puts Morbius in the uncomfortable position of asserting his innocence and dispatching his fanged friend. With a lack of humor and deadly exposition, Morbius propels itself into an absolutely wild third act, perhaps the unintentionally silliest finish I’ve seen this year. Because the movie squanders so much time setting up coagulants, international waters, and bat DNA, Morbius must defeat his childhood best friend and share an erotically violent kiss with his doctor lover in rapid succession to wrap this entire thing up. The five minutes or so in which this all happens borders on psychotic; I found myself hollering an obscene and inhuman hoot — a gurgling death rattle from the last vestiges of my sanity. Primed by the culmination of two years of Morbius trailers or spending the better part of an hour and a half watching Jared Leto slurp down blood bags like a college freshman, I could not believe Morbius was really all wrapping up like this. But deep down I knew this couldn’t actually be the end of Morbius because superhero franchises, like vampires, never really die. It dawned on me that there’s probably going to be a sequel, or some tie-in; that this horrendous thing was maybe just really the beginning. Soon enough, we may find ourselves haunted by another trailer.

"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," The latest hero from Marvel is hard to explain. He’s a man and yet also a bat. No, not Batman. Let me try again: He’s a daywalking vampire, but, no, not that cool cat Blade. This guy is good but also very bad. Look, he’s clearly got an identity crisis and his film is equally in trouble. “Morbius” is a forgettable, often laughable, entry in Sony’s attempt to fill its own Spider-Man-adjacent cinematic universe, a poorly edited, derivative time suck — pun intended. It wastes the considerable talents of Jared Leto, who is often left here looking like the snarling lead singer of a death metal band. So confused is the film’s execution that it more closely resembles a horror movie than a superhero flick.  Leto stars as Dr. Michael Morbius, a frail, brilliant and wealthy biochemist with a rare blood disease whose desperate search for a cure leads to a serum that makes him strong but also turns him into a vampire with a thirst for blood. After a hit of serum, he goes from needing crutches to swinging midair on pipes like an Olympic athlete. “I don’t know what I’m capable of,” he says. One downside: He has to chug blood bags, so there’s that. He also seems to be able to turn into a bat and fly but why he hasn’t flapped his way out of this film is unfathomable.  The filmmakers — director Daniel Espinosa, hobbled by a meandering script from Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless — simply do not know what to do with this creature once they’ve given us his backstory. They throw in a rivalry with his best friend (Matt Smith) and a love interest (Adria Arjona) hoping to reach something Shakespearian, but they’re treading water. Instead of a seamless, tight visual style, we are given jiggly camerawork and a buffet of previous films — “The Matrix,” “American Psycho,” “The Usual Suspects” and “An American Werewolf in London.” Typical Marvel violence is unleashed, including so much muscle that our hero smashes though New York City concrete streets to the subway system below. What’s astonishing is that despite a whole movie, we know very little about Morbius. He is so principled that he turns down a Nobel Prize but perfectly OK slaughtering henchmen. He makes delicate origami animals for sick kids and, despite having oodles of cash from inventing artificial blood, wears a cheap Casio watch. At one point, Morbius loses focus as the main guy when Smith’s rival character hijacks the film entirely. The special effects team work overtime to give Leto, unfortunately wearing a messy manbun throughout the film, a sort of bat-ness — his pupils cloud and his ear hairs vibrate like he’s using sonar. His skin will suddenly stretch over bone and he snarls a lot, too. For some reason, whenever he leaps, he is enveloped by a viscous cloud. He can also slo-mo and duck bullets and the action sequences build to moments when everything is suddenly stylistically still and quiet, like inside a hurricane’s eye. “It’s a curse,” Leto declares at one point and you wonder if maybe he’s talking about the role and its place in his career. But he’ll be fine. He just has to ignore moments like when Morbius is chained to a desk in a police department’s interview room and says: “I’m starting to get hungry and you don’t want to see me when I’m hungry.” There will be a lot of debate over where “Morbius” sits in the Marvel canon. There are clues that he has a future fighting Spider-Man but maybe the best thing for our vampire anti-hero is just to ignore him or swat at him like a wayward bat. “Morbius,” a Sony Pictures release slated for theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 for “intense sequences of violence, some frightening images, and brief strong language.” Running time: 104 minutes. One star out of four. "
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," What will you do with your one precious, beautiful life? Will you journey across the globe, fall in love, eat a sandwich? Or will you sink an hour and 44 minutes into Morbius, Sony’s latest anemic entry into the MCU-adjacent universe? The choice is yours, but I compel you to do literally anything besides seeing this dreadful excuse for a movie.  Morbius sees Jared Leto starring as the titular Dr. Michael Morbius, a brilliant physician with a rare blood disease that keeps him in ill health. Morbius’s mission has always been to cure his ailment, which has plagued him since childhood. A hazy flashback to said childhood sees Morbius in a children’s hospital in Greece, where he meets Lucien, a fellow kid afflicted with the same disease. Morbius doesn’t acknowledge Lucien, calling him Milo instead. You see, Milo was the name of the kid before him who died, and the kid before that and the kid before that. Lucien obviously isn’t going to make it, so he’s Milo now. Even the doctors, like kindly Dr. Nicholas (Jared Harris) call him Milo (very professional, very cool). If you think that’s cruel, then you’ll be surprised to find out that Lucien and Morbius are BFFs!  Not only that, but the wealthy Lucien/Milo remains best friends with Morbius well into adulthood, where he is played by Matt Smith, aka the only person who understands he’s in a comic book movie. The obscenely wealthy Milo has bankrolled Morbius’s experiments for years, which is wild considering Morbius still refuses to call him by his given name.  But after years of award-winning research, Morbius has finally zeroed in on a cure, which involves splicing human DNA with vampire bat DNA. He’s assisted by fellow doctor/love interest Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) who is given little to do beyond pining for Morbius and warning him of the dangers of experimentation. But Morbius will not be deterred! He is going to squeeze all the bat DNA out of those vampire bats (who are currently chilling in a wind tunnel in his lab) until he is one with the bats! Until he is some sort of bat…man? Hmm, interesting. I wonder if anyone’s done that superhero yet. Morbius is ready to inject himself full of bat juice, so he makes Milo charter a tanker in international waters complete with a full laboratory and some stock henchmen. Dr. Martine is there to warn him from going batty, while actively helping him achieve full batness. Well, you won’t believe what happens: Morbius injects himself with the bat goo, and he straight up becomes a vampire! Not just any vampire, but a LIVING vampire. What’s a living vampire, you may ask? It’s a person with vampy powers who can’t be killed by garlic or wooden stakes or sunlight. Sidebar: I’ve always thought the whole wooden stake thing was suspect, because if you drive a wooden stake through anyone’s heart (vampire or not), they’re gonna die, right? I don’t know, I’m not a doctor, but Morbius is! We know this because he tells us he’s a doctor at every opportunity.  Morbius’s powers include enhanced strength and speed, echolocation, and the ability to morph his face/body into a vampire-style monster. Remember on Buffy the Vampire Slayer when the vampires would transform and get those head bumps and fangs? It’s kind of like that. Morbius also BAMFs around leaving CGI black mist in his wake, much like Nightcrawler did in X2 (2003). God, this movie would be a million times better with Alan Cumming. Anyways, once Morbius goes full vamp he terrorizes the anonymous henchman aboard the ship, draining them of their blood. But don’t worry: while Morbius stone-cold murders 7 men, they’re a bunch of no-good criminals. We know this because one of them was sexist to Dr. Martine. We also know this because the FBI agents investigating the massacre straight up tell Morbius that they were criminals who deserved to die. AFBIAAB I guess. Said agents are Stroud (Tyrese Gibson) and Rodriguez (Al Madrigal), who are hot on Morbius’s heels while seemingly nonplussed that their perp is a vampire. In fact, no one in New York City seems disturbed that vampires are A) sort of real and B) terrorizing the subways. Rodriguez shrugs it off, citing the insanity in San Francisco (i.e. Venom) and everyone is extremely cool with it. I wish I could explain just how bad these agents are at their job, but I’ll say this. While investigating Dr. Martine’s apartment, they notice a litter box. Rodriguez then shakes the litter box while calling “here kitty kitty”, as if cats come running to the sound of their own feces being jiggled about. It’s such a minor moment, but it’s a lowkey metaphor for this movie. People are acting like they have no goddamn sense or logic. The film’s plot is lackluster, and there’s no humor, no charm, and no warmth to be found. It’s rare to see a film so devoid of style and ambition, that slugs along like a direct-to-video Underworld sequel. The film lacks a pulse, a heart, and a brain. It’s a zombie, but at least zombies are entertaining.  Meanwhile, Morbius refuses to give the cure to Milo, warning him that it’s a curse, but not elaborating beyond that. Milo takes the serum anyway, and begins living his best vampire life, dancing in front of mirrors, dressing snappy, and snacking on everyone he comes across. Once again, Matt Smith is the only person in this film having any fun whatsoever. His performance reminds me of Sharon Stone in Catwoman. Just two villains camping it up, desperately trying to inject life into a dreary comic book movie.  Milo wants Morbius to let loose and join him in traveling the world and eating folks along the way (Eat Prey Love?) which sounds like a way more entertaining film than the one they’re currently in. Morbius refuses, so now he has to kill his best friend before he eats more people. Oh, and Morbius can also fly now. Good for him. There’s lots of filler content while we wait for Morbius to kill Milo, which includes Morbius taking over an underground money counterfeiting ring and turning the money machines into lab equipment. It’s a callback to earlier when, as a child, he fixed a dialysis machine with a ballpoint pen.  Anyway, Morbius and Milo have their big monster fight showdown after Milo mortally wounds Dr. Martine. Luckily for her, Dr. Martine bites Morbius’s lip as she dies, giving her vampire powers and making them a vampire power couple. Good for her. Morbius and Milo have a big old CGI fight, while plenty of black mist and slow-motion freezes and personal anguish. Morbius kills Milo, because the film isn’t called Milo, and scuttles off into the darkness with his bat friends.  But wait, there’s more! There’s not one but TWO credits sequences, which see Adrian Toomes/Vulture (Michael Keaton) materialize into a jail cell, thanks to Doctor Strange’s multiverse shenanigans in Spider-Man: No Way Home. Once there, he passes by Morbius and is like, “Hey Morbius, we should get together. I already have a name for us: the Sinister Two!” and Morbius is like, “Get back to me with four more bad guys and I’ll consider it.” No mention of Venom or Eddie Brock. Now the gateway between the MCU and the Marvel Sony-verse is open. And I’m very tired. Does this mean we have to sit through three more villain origin stories to get a Sinister Six movie? If those films are as lifeless, unoriginal, and devoid of charisma as Morbius is, we are in for a dismal saga. I urge you to do anything other than see this film. It’s not even “good-bad” in a goofy way. It’s plain “bad-bad”, and you could honestly do anything else with your time and money and still have a better time. To put it simply, Morbius sucks. "
"Apr 1, 2022",NEUTRAL," Following the much-maligned Venom (2018) and Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021), the third film in Sony’s Spider-Man Universe stars Jared Leto as Nobel Prize-winning scientist Dr Michael Morbius. Suffering from a rare blood condition that threatens to take his life, Morbius self-enrols in an experimental cure, combining his DNA with that of a vampire bat and so destining himself for a future as a living vampire. Symptoms of Morbius’s newfound condition are as follows: super-human speed, super-human strength, echolocation and, as he ultimately discovers, flight. Morbius, for all intents and purposes, is a bat-man. The caveat? Like his animal donors, Morbius finds himself dependent on an atypical single-food diet. Blood, specifically of the human variety, is a must-have for the doctor if he is to stave off his underlying ill-health and keep at bay the primal monster that now lies dormant within. Artificial blood, upon which Morbius has established his medical reputation, is a useful makeshift. But not only does it lack potency, it delivers increasingly diminishing returns. It is within the context of this ""kill or be killed"" ultimatum that Morbius generates its tension. First mentioned in The Amazing Spider-Man #101 comic, Morbius is the eponymous figure’s screen debut. An uncommon privilege within a genre that seems to throw up re-boots with ever-increasing frequency, this blank slate offers director Daniel Espinosa a unique opportunity for imaginative character development. It is one he ignores, however, opting instead for a hurried backstory that sees Morbius rapidly propelled from his ill-sketched youth, spent in a children’s medical facility in Greece, to New York. The result leaves the audience feeling cheated, for what is given in time (and ticket entry) is never repaid; the doctor, devoid of depth, generates only the most superficial of emotional engagements. Like a more developed spidey-sense, Morbius’s echolocation is one of Marvel’s more unorthodox superpower creations – and initially, at least, special effects are put to good use to visualize this on screen. Over-indulgence quickly sets in, however, and the effect is quickly lessened. Morbius’s childhood friend and fellow patient Milo suffers no such problem. Instead, rendered with Matt Smith’s trademark quirkiness, his revelry in bloodlust fulfils the apparent need for a more textbook villain and gifts the film with some of its most memorable scenes. In one, the freshly cured Milo dances around a walk-in-wardrobe fixing his suit-and-tie and combing his hair, as if to recall the maniacal Patrick Bateman of Mary Harron's American Psycho (2000). Before viewing, one might have figured the role as Morbius as a strong fit for Leto, whose award-winning performances as Rayon in Dallas Buyers Club (2013) and, more recently, the eccentric Paolo Gucci in Ridley Scott’s House of Gucci (2021), should on paper translate well into this bloodsucking mad scientist. Sadly, his own performance is conservative, even austere. With it, Morbius joins the glaring disappointments of Suicide Squad (2016) and the yakuza drama The Outsider (2018) as the latest instalment in a hit-and-miss career."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,"It would seem fairly difficult to make a boring vampire flick, let alone one tied to the Marvel universe, but here we have it. Yes, vampires suck, but so does this movie. "
"Apr 1, 2022",POSITIVE,"Hardly the best in the superhero game, but a decently entertaining and moody entry that's hands down better than the lackluster ""Venom"" series."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," No, “Morbius” takes place within its own ecosystem, one that can’t happen without the promise of future installments and loose connections to past iterations. Remember when “The Amazing Spider-Man 2” tried to set-up The Sinister Six? This is worse than that. Helmed by Daniel Espinosa, who’s criminally underrated space chiller “Life” didn’t get nearly the attention it deserved, “Morbius'' opens in the jungles of Costa Rica with Dr. Morbius (Leto) hobbling into a secluded bat cave on two crutches (Critic Note: There wasn’t a Batman in sight). Born with a rare blood disease, the doc has spent his entire life trying to find a cure and his biggest “light bulb” moment is meshing bat and human DNA naturally. With the help of his beautiful co-pilot Martine (Adria Arjona), Morbius sets-up a cargo ship in, as the movie describes, “International Waters,” with a group of mercenaries to run a human trial of the medical discovery. Why are mercenaries aboard the ship? Because our vampire infused protagonist will need a quick snack as soon as his hankering for blood kicks in: (At one point in the movie, and this is not a joke, Leto straight face delivers the line: “You need to let me eat. You won’t like me when I’m hungry”). Side effects of the serum also include super-sonic “Bat Sonar,” chiseled abs, and skeleton-like cheekbones plus a necessity for several gulps of human blood daily. Sadly, the doc’s Nobel Prize winning creation of artificial blood won’t last forever, sooner or later he’ll need the real thing. Sucks being a vampire. It equally sucks being an audience member forced to endure a clumsily edited and laughably painful CGI slugfest. We’ve seen poor special effects before, but the transitions Leto goes through between human and vampire reaches new levels of absurdity. It’s like watching a carefully crafted train wreck: The effort and determination behind the scenes are evident (Espinosa and the writers try to create something fresh outside of the usual Marvel mold). Even a game Matt Smith, playing Morbius’ chummy pal who suffers from the same blood disease and becomes the films antagonist,  can’t shake the distress of being caught in a film with minimal ambitions (two mid-credit scenes were obviously tacked on as a last-minute piggyback on the success of “Spider-Man: No Way Home”). For anyone trying to keep a mental checklist of cinematic universes, they’ll probably walk out of the theater dizzy. Leto is no stranger to dabbling in the weird side of superhero and adult fare and, as you probably remember, has tried to throw his own spin on the Joker in “Suicide Squad” (I didn’t hate the choices despite the movie cratering) and many have dunked on him for wild turns in “The Little Things” and “House of Gucci,” – again, I didn’t mind either of those films. But it’s hard to find a silver lining in something so mismanaged as “Morbius,” a $75 million budgeted film that doesn’t give him enough leeway to dig underneath the character in a way those previous movies allowed. Hell, you can’t even see him half the time! There’s nothing fans must see in “Morbius” to be ready for whatever cross pollination Sony is currently planning. I’m just spitballing but I assume, at some point, the vampire will show up alongside Venom and probably fight a variation of Spider-Man and it’ll be in that moment you remember a solo movie about the character (whether you’ve seen it or not) even existed."
"Apr 1, 2022",POSITIVE," Morbius has no reason to exist as an actual movie, but maybe that’s why it worked for me. This origin story for a second-tier Spider-Man villain is largely Sony’s way of capitalizing on its rights to the Spidey universe in order to maintain a partnership with Marvel and keep up with Disney. It has relatively little to prove, and not much to advance brand-wise; the Spider-verse will happily live on whether this movie does or not. Really, Morbius exists primarily to deliver its end-credits scenes, which you can read about here and which feel like they belong in a completely different movie. But the film itself, the one that plays until those end-credits start to roll, is surprisingly fun, a picture that can just kind of be whatever the heck it wants. And it wants, unsurprisingly, to be a mad-scientist movie, with all the tragic melodrama that comes along with it. Freed from the shackles of elaborate world-building or jokey, family-friendly tentpole-dom, this is a tight, brisk little over-the-top thriller, with plenty of atmosphere, effective jump scares, and a couple of genuinely moving performances at its heart. As Michael Morbius, a brilliant doctor looking to cure a rare disease that prevents his body from creating new blood, Jared Leto seems well-suited to the part, with those sad, intense eyes, that gaunt visage, and that slightly aloof presence. You buy him as a sick man, you buy him as a possessed man, and you buy him as the buff (but still sad) vampire he becomes after fusing human blood with a bunch of bats he stole from a mountain in Costa Rica. The character’s sense of purpose defines him: Michael wants to save the world, and himself, but also his best friend. An early scene, set 25 years ago in Greece, shows him as a lonely 10-year-old patient at a private hospital, meeting fellow child patient Lucien, whom he dubs Milo, a name Michael apparently gives to every kid who comes through the hospital and dies. But Michael, already showing signs of genius, gets sent off to a special school in New York before he can lose New Milo to their horrid common ailment. “I’m gonna find a cure for us, so we can be cranky old men together,” he writes to his friend before leaving, setting up the bond between the two, as well as the painful turn it will eventually take. The whole film is built around this relationship, which is promising, especially since Milo grows up to be played by Matt Smith, one of those actors who seems incapable of giving an uninteresting performance. Adult Milo has little of young Milo’s emotional fragility; he’s a charismatic, devil-may-care hedonist, consistent with someone who’s lived life knowing they’re not long for this world. (The two pals like to evoke the dedication of the Spartan warriors at Thermopylae when talking about their friendship, but Milo seems to be, spiritually at least, a full-on Athenian.) Smith, whose angular features already make him look like a walking noir pastiche, plays off Leto nicely: He leans in where Leto hesitates, and he leers where Leto demurs. Smith’s eyes aren’t haunted like Leto’s; they’re hungry. The second you see the two men in the same room together, you know they’ll eventually wind up facing off. But they also seem meant for each other, since opposites attract and repel in equal measure. Mad-scientist movies always give us protagonists who grow to belatedly regret what they have created and/or become. In Morbius’s case, he first freaks out over the fact that his experiments have turned him into, you know, a bloodsucking monster, though he soon devises a way of keeping the transformations in check. But guess who else gets their hands on Morbius’s experimental vampire potion? (You don’t need to guess; there are only like four other people in the movie.) Milo isn’t perturbed by his transformation. He’s delighted. He even dances a little jig after slaughtering a couple of cops on the subway. Morbius was directed by Daniel Espinosa, a Swedish journeyman who has made what I consider to be some of the most dreadful mainstream movies of our time, so my expectations going into this thing were probably lower than anybody else’s. But somehow, Espinosa manages to bring an engaging, dreamy sense of style to this film’s bleak, nocturnal world. The action scenes seem to be shot more for beauty than coherence, a trade-off I’m happy with. Once transformed, Morbius leaps, sprints, and even flies through the city trailing ribbons of color and light. Is this to convey the batlike radar his brain can now access, or to hint at his wispy, impermanent state of being, or just to make him look a bit more like those cool Death Eaters in the Harry Potter movies? I have no idea, but it looks tremendous. Morbius was supposed to be released a couple of years ago, and it has reportedly been tampered with while sitting on the shelf, which has probably added to a preconception (among both critics and audiences, I suspect) that the film is doomed, an aesthetic and financial write-off. But see if you can watch it with an open mind. In a world where the cultural terraforming of our cinema by comic-book movies is mostly complete, it actually feels like a welcome little stray, a movie that pays lip service to its corporate aims while delivering something sad, suspenseful, and unexpectedly heartfelt."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," Sony’s effort to build its own universe of Spider-man-adjacent superhero stories which has borne huge fruit with the two Venom movies, continues with Morbius, an all-around ill-conceived effort sporting a boring hero, an uninteresting villain, and probably the least-appealing visual style of any film this year.  The film, directed by the Chilean-Swedish director Daniel Espinosa (Life, Safe House), is based on the Marvel character Morbius, the Living Vampire. While its premise has a germ of a good idea, its story can never quite get going, and its visual style is cruddy and ugly. The action sequences, in particular, are a chore to sit through.  The premise of Morbius is that Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) has suffered for his entire life from a rare blood disease. Raised in what appears to be a hospital/orphanage hybrid under the care of a doctor (Jared Harris), Morbius grows up to become a brilliant scientist who has devoted his life to trying to cure the condition, but for himself and others similarly afflicted.  Morbius then attempts a cure, involving bats, so experimental and controversial that it can only be performed on a boat in international waters- and it succeeds, with the unfortunate side effect of turning him into a vampire. No, it doesn’t require him to be undead, and he can still be outside in the sunlight. But he gets all the other aspects of vampirism, including the Dracula-style fingers, and the overwhelming urge to suck blood.  The character spends most of the movie trying to be an “ethical” vampire, able to inject synthetic blood to keep the demons away, at least for dwindling periods of time. Meanwhile, his lifelong best friend (Matt Smith), who had a similar condition, isn’t so concerned about the ethical part.  There are some decent ideas here, but most of them, whether it’s his quest to not kill or various allegorical elements have been well-trodden before, especially by Twilight, True Blood, and other touchstones of the vampire craze of the aughts.  The biggest failure of the film, though, is visual. It looks like crud, almost every minute. The action scenes, in particular, are a poorly shot muddle, with shaky-cam galore. And it concludes with one of the more underwhelming finales of any superhero film in memory. I would also love, one of these days, for the mid- or post-credits sequence of one of these things to be held somehow besides a prison or mental hospital.  Leto, needless to say, is something of a polarizing actor. No one has such a great opinion about his brief turn as the Joker, and his turn in last year’s House of Gucci was much-mocked (though I laughed my ass off every minute he was on screen.) Leto’s method intensity is serving him well currently on WeCrashed, the current Apple series about the collapse of WeWork.  But in Morbius, he gives something of a listless performance, one that leaves no mark. That’s also the case with Smith, who gets one great moment where he gets to dance, but doesn’t make much of an impression otherwise. Adria Arjuna has quite an on-screen presence as Morbius’ partner and love interest, but she isn’t given much to do.  Meanwhile, Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal, portraying a pair of FBI agents investigating the paranormal events, are off in their own little movie — one that owes more to The X-Files than to anything Marvel — which is much more interesting than the main one.  There’s one amusing thing I noticed, which is that every time the film shows a news report, there’s a bit at the end in which the reporter says “a source” has told them some insider info about what happened in the previous scene. This implies that the FBI agent characters, offscreen, have been leaking to the press all along. It’s like the screenplay is making a subtle point about the interplay between media and law enforcement, in a movie that has practically nothing to say about anything else.  Still, these are the first movie cops I’ve ever seen who, after a long stretch investigating a crime scene, look up and notice that there’s a surveillance camera. I’d imagine most law enforcement professionals would look for that first.  I hated both Venom films too, which were huge hits, so I wouldn’t be shocked if Morbius succeeds and leads to numerous future sequels and spinoffs (the Venom movies, at least, offered some humor, and a charismatic lead performance). But Morbius, in most ways, is ghastly.  Stephen Silver is a journalist and film critic based in the Philadelphia area.

"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," There are not a lot of good things to say about the latest marginal Marvel character to hit the big screen, and plenty of bad ones. This sidebar effort — a nonsensical Frankenstein/Dracula/Jekyll & Hyde mashup — is from the Sony/Columbia offshoot of the Spider-Man branch of the Marvel family. He’s the titular black-sheep cousin. His weird vibe is so dark that I suspect most viewers won’t want him to return for another seat at their dinner table, even if there’s a heaping bowl of blood available for his li(c)king. This vampire bat/human hybrid beast comes when you mix bad science with bad filmmaking. All it takes is for a Noble Prize-winning medical researcher, Dr. Michael Morbius (hobbled by a rare blood condition) to play guinea pig and turn himself into a menacing anti-hero. A quite unappealing one. Jared Leto, who transformed himself under tons of makeup into Paolo Gucci in House of Gucci, offers up a different transformation, mostly via dreary CGI, as a grumpy, quasi-vampiric creature. He’s done superhero before, as the Joker in the first Suicide Squad (2016), with a similar snideness wafting through the air. Few jokes abound (one referencing the symbiote Venom, another that names a cargo ship Murnau — an easter egg nod toward that German director’s silent 1920s horror classic Nosferatu). Frankly, the film’s writers (Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless) make this comic character way too serious. Its origin story antics are poorly written and the blurry, kinetic action afforded it by director Daniel Espinosa makes this uneasy tale all the more unsettling. I took a gander at the screenwriting credits of Sazama and Sharpless. Gods of Egypt (2016), The Last Witch Hunter (2015), and Dracula Untold (2014). All duds (like his latest), with abysmal ratings on Rotten Tomatoes. They won a Razzie, and may repeat that feat. The epitaph to their misbegotten writing career is now being written in bat guano. Morbius isn’t a sympathetic character either — even when he appears remorseful. His best friend, afflicted with the same ailment, Loxias Crown a.k.a. Milo (Matt Smith as the preening adult version), decides that a little dab of the bad, bad doctor’s own medicine will provide an unlucky panacea. Yet, all we get are a series of mano-a-mano escapades that wreak havoc on the city and some of its innocent inhabitants. Along for their ride are underwritten characters, including the boys’/men’s mentor Dr. Emill Nikols (Jared Harris) and Morbius’ capable assistant Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona). Trivia question for the future: What 2021 Marvel movie dud featured two Jareds? The helter-skelter changes in Morbius — gnarly teeth and nasty complexion one moment, some buff abs the next, and then occasionally back to his muscle-challenged version which causes near-complete paralysis. I me wonder if enlisting a dentist to direct this movie may have been a better idea. Or maybe Little Red Riding Hood. As the film begins, the determined Dr. M is on a mission, in a remote Costa Rican jungle. It’s a scene that mines imagery from King Kong (any version), but instead of a giant primate, let’s look for primal vampire bats. The tale then backpedals 25 years, to the younger version of Leto’s character, in a Greek hospital (because?), where Dr. Nikols sends him on a lifelong mission to find the magic bullet to cure his illness (and apparently succeeding with a few other sicknesses, for which he gains global admiration). As Morbius begins to cross too many ethical lines, he becomes a pariah amongst his peers. And then desperation sets in and he decides to self-inject. The rest of the film is all showboating amongst the broody gloom and posturing between the two friends. Meanwhile, deaths, and bodies drained of blood, pile up. Like those corpses, the film is draining in the worst B-movie way. Spoiler Alert: There were two end credit teaser scenes (maybe more, but I didn’t feel obliged to stay any longer). Michael Keaton (Holy, Batman!) is Adrian Toomes a.k.a. The Vulture. So, yeah, you can pretty much assume that no matter how bad this film is (count me among the legions warning you), that Morbius might be recruited into bigger things involving Spidey and Friends. Wait, there are some amusing moments in the film, but I hope you won’t bother for the few minutes that Al Madrigal and Tyrese Gibson are on-screen as bemused detectives. Yet, with the antiseptic, mundane dialogue they’re forced to mutter, it’s a pity that comedian Madrigal took this gig. I hope it was for the money. Elias Savada is a movie copyright researcher, critic, craft beer geek, and avid genealogist based in Bethesda, Maryland. He helps program the Spooky Movie International Movie Film Festival, and previously reviewed for Film Threat and Nitrate Online. He is an executive producer of the horror film German Angst and the documentary Nuts! He co-authored, with David J. Skal, Dark Carnival: the Secret World of Tod Browning (a revised edition will be published by Centipede Press). If I had a nickel for every time that a “critic” thought that Morbius is part of the MCU, I’d have two nickels. Which isn’t a lot but still perturbing considering that it’s a pretty basic distinction."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," CHICAGO - It’s an accepted part of modern day superhero filmmaking that the trailers are going to lie a bit. Saving CGI reveals or cutting around a big climatic fight is a reasonable way to preserve a sense of fun and surprise for the eventual audience. But the trailers for the Jared Leto-led superhero movie ""Morbius"" take things a step further. They imply that Michael Keaton’s ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" character Adrian Toomes is going to be a major presence throughout the film when in actuality he only pops up in a totally unrelated post-credits sequence.  Taken on its own, that’s just a hilariously brash bit of marketing manipulation. But it also reflects the general sense of desperation that hangs over the film, which seems like it’s in full damage-control mode from the moment it begins. Whatever scrap of originality may have initially motivated this project has been trimmed down to something vague (and vaguely palatable) designed to get audiences in and out in under two hours. Originally planned for a July 2020 premiere before the pandemic pushed it back, ""Morbius"" is ostensibly Sony Pictures’ attempt to recapture the ""Spider-Man""-adjacent success of its gonzo ""Venom"" franchise. Instead it feels as gloppy and formless as the symbiote himself. The hook of ""Morbius"" is that it mixes superhero and vampire tropes together as Dr. Michael Morbius (Leto) sets out to cure his rare, debilitating blood disease and accidentally turns himself into a superpowered bat creature instead. Setting aside that the Wesley Snipes vehicle ""Blade"" already offered that particular comic book combo back in the ‘90s (as Mahershala Ali’s upcoming MCU reboot will too), ""Morbius"" has a steep hill to climb given that superheroes and vampires are two of the most well-trod genres in live action pop culture.  Whether your reference point is ""Angel,"" ""Twilight"" or ""The Vampire Diaries,"" Morbius’ crisis of conscience about drinking human blood will feel awfully familiar; just as his whole ""reluctant hero"" schtick will feel garden-variety to anyone who’s ever seen a superhero movie before. (So, everyone.) Plus, since this is first and foremost a Hulk-style science-gone-wrong story, ""Morbius"" misses out of some of the coolest bits of vampire lore — like the idea of living an immortal life through centuries of human history. Instead all we have is a man who decides to cure his blood disorder by casually splicing human and bat DNA together; you know, as one does.  What’s left is a superhero origin story that never quite finds its center because it’s so choppily edited and narratively inert. There’s no driving plot or pointed character study, just lots and lots of incident. The film clumsily rushes through its setup to get Morbius to his souped-up vampire state. But once it does, it doesn’t seem to have any idea what to do with him. Instead, the standout turn comes from Matt Smith, who would very much like people to remember that he starred as Patrick Bateman in the West End musical version of ""American Psycho,"" thank you very much. Smith stylishly sashays his way through the role of Milo, Morbius’ wealthy childhood best friend who suffers from the same blood disorder and has far fewer moral scruples when it comes to figuring out how to cure it.  As with Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise in ""Interview with the Vampire,"" there’s an undercurrent of romantic longing to the brotherly bond between Milo and Morbius. And it feels like a better version of ""Morbius"" would’ve put their complicated dynamic even more front and center. Alas, ""Morbius"" is too bound to comic book movie convention to become the overt gay vampire superhero melodrama it probably should have been. Instead, Adria Arjona is there because Morbius needs a (female) love interest. Jared Harris is there because he needs a father figure. And Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal are there because these kinds of movies usually have cops in them, right?  ""Morbius"" does feature the occasional dash of visual panache; these moments are serviceable enough, if hardly reason alone to see the movie. Random bursts of stylized slow-motion echo a ""Matrix"" sequel or Zack Snyder film, while Morbius’ vampire abilities are highlighted with trails of billowing colored smoke that call to mind Nightcrawler in the ""X-Men"" movies.  Indeed, ""Morbius"" often conjures-up those forgettable latter day X-Men films like ""Dark Phoenix"" or ""The New Mutants"" — movies that barely seem to have existed at all. Innocuous at best and laughable at worst, ""Morbius"" has no legs — or wings — to stand on.

"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," The last time a studio decided to build a film franchise out of a vampire from the Marvel Comics world, 1998’s Blade paved the way for the Marvel Cinematic Universe we know today. This year’s long-delayed Morbius, however, feels more like a stake through Sony Pictures’ superhero-loving heart. Directed by Daniel Espinosa (Safe House, Life) and featuring Oscar winner Jared Leto in the title role, Morbius follows brilliant scientist Michael Morbius (Leto), whose efforts to cure his debilitating blood disease lead him to conduct dangerous experiments with vampire bats. One such experiment seems to deliver that cure — along with a host of superhuman abilities — but also gives him an insatiable bloodlust. His attempts to cure himself of those deadly urges are complicated by the emergence of a villain with similar traits who’s happy to indulge his brutal instincts. In theory, Morbius has all the ingredients for a fun, entertaining film. It has an accomplished, quirky actor in the lead role who’s more than willing to dive into the characters he plays, and it surrounds him with a similarly talented supporting cast. Emmy-nominated The Crown and Doctor Who actor Matt Smith plays Morbius’ best friend, Milo, who suffers from the same blood disease, while Adria Arjona (Pacific Rim: Uprising) plays Morbius’ research partner and love interest, Martine. They’re joined by two-time Emmy nominee Jared Harris (Chernobyl, Mad Men) as Morbius’ father figure and caretaker. Along with that impressive cast, Morbius arrives with plenty of ties to established Marvel franchises, existing in the same universe as the (relatively successful) Venom films while also adjacent to the (outrageously successful) MCU proper, thanks to the increasingly blurred boundary between Sony and Marvel Studios’ characters. That connection gets plenty of attention in the film, too, with references to elements of the MCU and Venom films peppered throughout Morbius’ adventure. Despite offering plenty of opportunities for its protagonist’s tragic childhood and plight as an adult to strike an emotional chord with audiences, Morbius never ventures much below the surface with its title character or any of the supporting cast, for that matter. You’re given little reason to care about Morbius or forge any kind of connection with the sentiments that drive him, making the stakes feel frustratingly low and leaving the characters feeling detached from anything familiar. Leto seemingly does the best he can with the material he’s given, but there’s simply not much dramatic meat on the bone in Morbius. The entertainment factor increases a bit with Smith, though, who leans into his arc with a wild abandon that often overshadows Leto’s more muted and (seemingly intentional) brooding performance. Smith is always fun to watch, and that’s especially true in Morbius, where he’s the brightest light in a dark and fairly dull environment. Of course, Morbius didn’t need to be dull. From the aforementioned Blade to the more recent Deadpool films, there’s plenty of precedent for embracing the bloodier side of superhero stories. And what sort of project would be better-suited for that sort of horror-fueled treatment than a film about a superhero vampire? Sadly, Morbius is surprisingly bloodless for a film about a character obsessed with, well … blood. The action is bland by comic book movie standards, the scares are tame, and the characters are largely uninspiring (and not even moderately cheer-worthy) for much of the story. Rather than leaning into any of the elements that could have made Morbius stand out in a crowded genre, the film opts to remain frustratingly tepid across the board, hesitating to commit to any of the cinematic possibilities its source material offers. Still, even as Morbius seems intent on wasting its potential, the film also comes across as shamefully desperate to prove its value in the larger Marvel movie-verse shared by Sony and Marvel Studios. Nods to the MCU and Sony’s cinematic Spider-Man universe are shoehorned into the story in ways that make Marvel movies’ ubiquitous self-reference seem subtle in comparison. These heavy callouts culminate in a pair of mid-credits sequences that seem completely disconnected from the film’s story, intended to offer another reminder that Marvel’s recent Spider-Man films and Sony’s superhero universe are indeed connected — just in case you forgot. It seems silly to call a film about a vampire “lifeless,” but that might be the most accurate label you can apply to Morbius, which wastes a tremendous amount of potential by consistently opting for the most boring, predictable storytelling decisions at every turn. Morbius had every opportunity to be just as groundbreaking as that other Marvel vampire film was years ago, but instead it feels like just another nail in the coffin of Sony’s Spider-verse. It took until 2014 for Marvel to give a Muslim character their own comic book series, but once they did, it wasn't long before Ms. Marvel's teenage protagonist Kamala Khan became one of the publisher's most popular young heroes. Fast-forward eight years, and Kamala is set to make her live-action debut in the Disney+ series Ms. Marvel, which officially welcomes the Pakistani-American teen and her supporting cast into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Although it's been a speedy road to the spotlight for Kamala Khan, if the first few episodes of Ms. Marvel are any indication of what's to come for her live-action adventures, she's got a bright future ahead of her. After 27 films and a long list of box-office records, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has become one of Hollywood's safest bets, enjoying critical and commercial success for each highly anticipated (to put it mildly) installment of the franchise. But they can't all be hits, can they? If there's one thing the over-packed but visually stunning Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness makes clear, it's that even one of the MCU's clunkiest films so far can provide an entertaining experience.

"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," Academy Award winner Jared Leto (“Dallas Buyers Club”) plays the title tole in the Marvel by way of Sony origin film “Morbius.” Known for his at times outlandish acting style (See “House of Gucci.”), Leto tries to transform biochemist-turned-vampire Michael Morbius into a character of Shakespearean proportion. But he fails badly, sabotaged by screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, whose script for “Dracula Untold” should have disqualified them from writing another bloodsucker film. Don’t get me started on the ridiculous “Gods of Egypt.” The Marvel “Morbius” is essentially “Dracula” meets “The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.” After capturing a swarm of vampire bats in Costa Rica with little or no regard for the safety of his companions, Morbius, who suffers from a blood disease and whose name comes from a character in the science-fiction classic “Forbidden Planet,” returns to his lab in New York City, home to Spider-Man. In his bat-decorated lair, Morbius experiments upon himself (never a good idea in this kind of thing) and, of course, turns himself into a super-fast, super-powerful, bat-faced monster. He is also trying to find a cure for his boyhood friend Milo (Matt Smith of the superhuman cheekbones). Michael and Milo were basically raised in a Greek facility by paternal Dr. Emil Nikols (Jared Harris). When he drinks artificial blood, Morbius returns to his human self, completely cured of his disease. But he returns to monster form in increasingly shorter periods of time. Helping him to find a solution is the beautiful Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona, “Life of the Party”). Also on hand are NYPD detective Simon Stroud (Tyrese Gibson) and Agent Rodriguez (a thankfully funny Al Madrigal), who are investigating the blood-draining murders of over a dozen mercenaries on a container ship off the coast of Long Island. The mad scientist bit is all too familiar, and the Michael and Milo rivalry will ring bells for anyone who’s read or seen “Interview with a Vampire.” The effects, many involving transformations from man to monster and back again, are fine. But we’ve seen this stuff a million times. “Morbius,” which is part of the “Spider-Man” universe along with “Venom,” is nothing if not derivative. On a bus, Martine reads the front page of Daily Bugle. In one sequence, Milo dances sexy in front of a mirror admiring both his human and monster-vampire selves. It’s not quite Tom Cruise in “Risky Business.” But it could have been better and funnier without much effort. Director Daniel Espinosa, a Swede, has made a great film (“Snabba Cash”), a good film (“Safe House”) and an incomprehensible film (“Child 44”). “Morbius” is just thoroughly mediocre. Morbius and Milo flit around Manhattan, fighting, destroying other people’s property and leaving odd trails of color behind them as they flit. In a scene out of one of those bad “Halloween” sequels, a frightened nurse is drained of her blood in a hospital with flickering lights. Leto appears to battle the dialogue as much as he battles Milo. The two become sort of rivals for Martine’s affection, although the romantic element amounts only to more cliches. In a rare amusing bit, Agent Rodriguez brings holy water to the station to question a restrained Morbius. Harris, a great actor, is unable to do anything with the surrogate daddy role. Another villain from the Spider-verse makes an appearance at the end. Cue the ear-splitting sound of flapping wings."
"Apr 1, 2022",POSITIVE,"Morbius is a throwback to a simpler and less sophisticated era of superhero movies. Its not terrible, great, or even so bad, its goodits just super average. "

"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,It is so consistently uninventive  even apathetic  that one cannot help but ask if anyone involved even considered the possibility that making a good movie was an option.
"Apr 1, 2022",POSITIVE," He has a rare blood disease, and so he experiments on vampire bats, splicing their DNA with his own. The result: super strength, incredible stamina, echolocation and freaky inkblot eyeballs. He can leap so high he can practically fly, and even riled-up bats don’t seem troubled by him. Let’s face it – if the name Batman weren’t already taken, Dr. Michael Morbius would be a model match for the moniker. As it is he has to settle for “vampire killer,” which is both dull and ambiguous. Blade was a vampire killer. Abraham Lincoln was a vampire killer. What you’re looking at here is a vampire. “Killer” is a given. Jared Leto plays Morbius, just the latest Marvel creation to grace the big screen, though the movie is refreshingly free of references to others, at least until the obligatory mid-credit scenes. Even the Daily Bugle, which can be counted on to splash Spider-Man across its front page the way some newspapers go after Justin Trudeau, makes Morbius the main story. We meet him as a boy in a children’s hospital, where he saves the life of fellow patient Milo, who’s played by Matt Smith as an adult. Years later, Morbius is a famous scientist – a Nobel recipient who turns down the prize, saying he can’t accept such an honour until he succeeds at his work. His colleague is Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), whom we sense has more than mere professional respect for him. Of course, anyone who’s familiar with gamma radiation, super serums or alien artifacts will know that Morbius is headed for trouble with his experiments, well meaning though they may be. And sure enough, the very thing that cures his wasting condition leaves him with an almost insatiable thirst for human blood. “Drink the red or die,” he muses, sounding like a crazed sommelier. Can he put his newfound powers to good use, or will he succumb to their dark side? Screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (they wrote Dracula Untold!) do a good job laying out the ethical considerations of a modern-day vampire in New York. And director Daniel Espinosa makes the story pop, with some wicked-cool slow motion, freeze frames and framing that make scenes resemble their comic book progenitors. It’s been far too long since I’ve seen a superhero movie whose special effects were both jaw-dropping and seemingly effortless. I mean, of course Morbius leaves this wispy, streaky, smoky effect behind him when he moves. If you liked The Flash entering the speed force, you’re going to love this. His character’s wildly impractical, questionably safe and certainly illegal wafting around in front of a subway train is worth the price of admission. Secondary characters include Jared Harris (it’s a two-Jared movie!) as Morbius’s childhood doctor and friend, the aforementioned Smith as his benefactor, and Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal as FBI agents Stroud and Rodriguez, the latter introducing audiences to the word exsanguinated. “I looked it up,” he admits. Me too. And now I feel smarter. One more item in favour of Morbius. On the negative side, a pair of mid-credit scenes that add a needless layer of confusion while basically promising a sequel. You know, in case you thought Morbius was, like so many other superhero stories, a one-and-done. Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," Dear Sony: Stop trying to make the Sony Spider-Verse happen. It’s never going to happen, especially not if you keep dropping bombs like Morbius. Maybe after pushing back the release date approximately seventeen times, you should have quietly let this slip to streaming where it might find its way into an unsuspecting soul’s suggestions. To call this film dead on arrival isn’t truly accurate, because to be dead I think you actually have to have to have been alive at some point. Who is Morbius and why should we care? Both good questions, but only one has an easy answer. Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) is a brilliant man with an extremely rare blood condition that he shares with his surrogate brother Milo (Matt Smith). Morbius develops an experimental cure that splices human DNA with that of vampire bats, and testing on it himself transforms him into a vampire-like creature with multiple special powers but with an insatiable lust for blood. When Milo gets his hands on the cure and goes vampire himself, Morbius must contend with both the monster within himself and the monster Milo has become. If that sounds at all interesting in theory, let me assure you that in practice it is not. Morbius is a c-list anti-hero/anti-villain from the Spider-Man comics that’s made a handful of appearances outside of that arena, and even fans of Marvel Comics often only have a vague idea of who he is. This isn’t always a problem. Marvel Studios has proven that they can take more obscure characters like the Guardians of the Galaxy or the Winter Soldier and turn them into household names. Sony…cannot.  Which brings us to the second question: why should we care? The short answer is that we shouldn’t, or at least we can’t based on the film that’s been delivered. Director Daniel Espinoza has a history of making acceptable if not remarkable genre films, and he does what he can here, but one of the film’s biggest problems is its script. Writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless are responsible for some truly awful things like Gods of Egypt and even other disappointing vampire-based films like Dracula Untold. They continue their streak here with a pointless story, flat characters, and a conflict that goes nowhere and means nothing. Morbius himself is a major contributor to the ennui the film traffics in. As written, he’s a terribly boring character. We learn little about him other than he’s a genius and has a blood disorder that he’s spent his life trying to cure. He exists largely without context in a setting without grounding. New York City has rarely appeared as generic and unremarkable as it does here (probably because city scenes were actually filmed in UK). The film can’t even properly define Morbius’ powers, and they tend to be as powerful as the script needs them to be with new ones doled out as plot coupons.  Jared Leto does nothing at all to elevate Morbius, either. His performance is horribly one-note, his emotional palette nothing but a series of grays. He broods and whispers his way through every scene, barely coming alive except the scenes where Morbius is struggling to resist transforming into his vampiric self. Even then, he barely appears to put any real effort into his role. He’s supposed to have an important romantic subplot with fellow doctor and researcher Martine Bancroft (played by a criminally underused Adria Arjona). And this is where I make a bad joke about the two doctors having zero chemistry together, right?  There’s almost no real, meaningful conflict at all here, either. The official antagonist is pretty early set up to be Milo, who’s ethical code is much looser than Morbius’, but the stakes there are pretty low. Milo isn’t trying to bring down the city or end the world; he just wants to be a cool, murderous vampire alongside his best friend after living a life of pain and sickness under the specter of an early death. As far as motivations go, it’s relatively relatable if you take away the bloodlust, especially for someone who’s lived with debilitating health conditions.  And I’m sorry; an antagonist named Milo? Excuse me, but I’m having a hard time caring. (Yes, I know his given name is Lucien, but nobody calls him that, and I still don’t care.) The film wants the true conflict to be between Morbius and his vampire self. Will Morbius give in to his dark side? Will he embrace his powers and try to find a way to live in the shadows or in the light? Will he decide that the cure is really a curse and seek to remove it?  Again, there is nothing to latch onto here. Michael Morbius is a nothing character played by an actor who brings nothing to the screen. Milo is by far the more interesting of the two of them, if only because Matt Smith looks like he’s having the time of his life. He sinks his teeth (HA! I made a vampire pun!) into the role and doesn’t let go. As the sickly Milo he’s not terribly interesting, but as the vampiric Milo he’s a riot, a perfectly campy and entertaining villain that’s far more than the film deserves. He even gets a shirtless scene where he shows off a pumped up, chiseled physique that raises the film’s heart rate for a brief and flickering moment. The only things the film really has going for it beyond the Matt Smith singularity are some interesting if not fantastic special effects. How Espinoza has decided to portray the vampiric powers is relatively interesting, even if it becomes tedious after a while and eventually bogs down an already confusing, graceless climax. Jon Elkstrand’s score is also better than the film itself and is responsible for a ton of the dramatic weight of the narrative even if it rarely shuts up, which is more the director’s issue than the composer’s.  Morbius is a sad attempt to prop up Sony’s ill-advised Spider-Verse-Without-Spider-Man-Verse and tap into the same darker energies that made the first Venom movie a hit. But whereas Venom at least had a killer lead performance by Tom Hardy propping what was an otherwise dated and shallow superhero film, Morbius doesn’t even have that. It’s lifeless, pointless, and toothless. Also: If you do decide to see the film, don’t bother staying for the two mid-credits scenes. They have nothing to do with the film itself, make zero sense, and are a clumsy attempt at franchise-building. The first scene introduces a plot hole that the second scene then barrels through like a cartoon character running through a brick wall. "
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," The critics have spoken. And it’s not looking good for “Morbius,” now in theaters as a showcase for Jared Leto as Marvel’s “living vampire.” Such adjectives as “boring,” “disjointed” and “incoherent” have been tossed at Sony’s big-screen debut for a minor-league villain created by Marvel Comics in 1971 to pester Spider-Man. Come on, this movie is much worse than that. And none of it matters. “Morbius” is the third film in the studio’s spin into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, following “Venom” and “Venom: Let There Be Carnage,” which raked in over a billion bucks despite a burn from reviewers. Audience appetite for comic-book antiheroes means you’re going to line up for “Morbius” no matter what anyone says. From Loki to Thanos, bad boys are big box office. And Leto, an Oscar winner who played the Joker in “The “Suicide Squad,” always goes the extra mile. The actor never condescends to the role of Dr. Michael Moribus, a scientist who accidentally turns himself into a vampire after combining his DNA with that of a Costa Rican vampire bat to cure a rare blood disease that put him on crutches and sapped his strength. Having finished shooting nearly three years ago, “Morbius” feels like it’s been tinkered with during the period when the pandemic pushed the release dates of mega-budget epics that wanted to wait for theaters to reopen in a big way. That time seems to be now. Look at “The Batman.” At its core, “Morbius” is a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde ripoff about a good doctor who heals himself thorough illegal experiments that turn him into a monster with pointy teeth. Yes, he gains super strength and speed, but the urge to kill people leaves him feeling guilty afterwards. And that’s a problem right there because it allows Matt Smith, a former Doctor Who who crushed it as a young Prince Phillip on “The Crown,” to steal the movie right out from under Leto’s star spot. Smith plays Milo, a Morbius friend since childhood who suffers from the same blood disease but has no interest in stewing in brooding misery. Milo is a natural-born party boy. The minute Milo steals a dose of bat blood serum from Morbius, he’s off to the races. Milo is a billionaire who’s been living large in Manhattan from the outset. But the serum brings out the delicious worst in him, within PG-13 limits. Milo doesn’t wear a t-shirt saying, “What’s So Bad About Feeling Good,” but he could. Whenever Milo is off screen, the air goes out of this movie. Truth to be told, “Morbius” never had much helium to begin with. Director Daniel Espinosa (“Life,” “Safe House”) dutifully connects the dots of the story without taking any flights of imagination that might have lifted it past the merely generic. Espinosa needed a dose of Milo. “Morbius” comes in under two hours, but it feels much longer. The hot romance between Morbius and his colleague Martine (Adria Arjona) is barely lukewarm. Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal are strictly pro forma as FBI agents in over their heads. Even the great Jared Harris doesn’t add much as the father figure to these fang boys. What we’re left with in “Morbius” is the ghost of an effective horrorfest overwhelmed by an elephantine budget, botched suspense and the need to brag, especially during the shameless, sequel-begging end credits, that it is Spider-Man adjacent. Even the creepily charismatic Leto and Smith can’t sell a vampire epic that would profit most from a stake through its heart."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," Morbius is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence, some frightening images, and brief strong language. The running time is 1 hour and 44 minutes."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," The jokes have to be good because the central plot is as old as any crime caper. Wolf is a bad guy tempted by the chance to go straight. He has an epiphany when he realises helping an old lady is more rewarding than robbing her. But his gang are not so easy to rehabilitate, particularly closest pal Snake. Idris should have insisted on better material before signing up to be a voice on this family movie based on the hugely popular Nineties video game character. Whenever his live-action villain Dr Robotnik is on screen, everything is more colourful. Which is pretty remarkable given his main co-stars are computer-generated cartoon characters in vivid red, yellow and blue. AFTER playing Joker in DC’s Extended Universe, Jared Leto switches gear as the bloodsucking antihero Morbius in Sony’s Spider-Verse. But this Marvel outing is nothing but draining. Michael Morbius is a top biochemist who has dedicated his life to curing himself and his rich childhood friend Milo (Matt Smith) of a rare blood disease. This is utterly scattergun storytelling from Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless but not unexpected from the screenwriting duo behind The Last Witchhunter and Gods Of Egypt. It could not be further from the brilliance and style of Wesley Snipes’ Blade trilogy, another vampiric Marvel hero, where the artistic application of CGI is far more constructive than the frenzied overuse here. The cast cannot elevate a bland, lifeless narrative with direction from Daniel Espinosa that fails to capture any of the romantic yearning and melancholy associated with vampires or the excitement of the superhero genre the world has grown to love."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEUTRAL,"As disappointing as the movie may be, its post-credit sequence is even worse."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," Morbius was released into theaters on April 1, so I have to ask: Are we sure it isn’t some kind of elaborate April Fools’ Day prank? At the very least, it feels like one. There are very few times in my life I have seen a film this poorly performed, this awkwardly written, this obviously taken apart and reconstructed in the editing room. It may be about a vampire but it feels more like the work of a cinematic Dr. Frankenstein; sutured together from bits and pieces of different storylines and characters that don’t fit, and then zapped into unholy, disjointed life. Its title character, played by Jared Leto, has spent his entire life grappling with a rare blood disease. This incurable illness’ name and exact symptoms are not really explained; all that really matters is that it makes the perpetually weak and sickly Michael Morbius and his good friend Milo (or Lucien; he seems to have two names for some reason) need constant transfusions. As a child, Morbius was treated by a kind doctor (Jared Harris) at a private hospital in Greece; when he grows into his full Letohood, he becomes a doctor and scientist himself. Driven to find a cure for his condition, he invents a kind of synthetic blood that saves millions of lives. Then Morbius gets obsessed with vampire bats and their unique ability to metabolize blood. He collects a swarm of vampire bats and then heads out into international waters — literally, a title card onscreen reads “INTERNATIONAL WATERS” — and he injects himself with a vampire bat serum. You’ll never guess what happens to him next. These broad strokes sound sensible on paper, but words do not adequately capture just how sloppy and disorganized Morbius is. Director Daniel Espinosa seems to have cut the context, nuance, and character development out of every scene until all that was left was stunts, action, and Leto and Smith in CGI vampire makeup hissing at each other. Jared Harris, for example, is barely in the movie; if his doctor character ever served a larger purpose in the story, it’s long gone. Likewise, Michael Keaton’s Adrian Toomes, who previously served as the villain in Spider-Man: Homecoming and featured prominently in all of Morbius’ trailers, appears onscreen here for maybe 45 seconds total. In fact, based on Morbius’ trailers, it seems like it was conceived as a totally different movie. In those trailers, Tyrese Gibson’s character, an FBI agent named Simon Stroud, has a big robotic arm. In the film, he’s just an ordinary guy, and he only pops up occasionally to examine Morbius’ crime scenes. He also has a line in the trailer about how Morbius “has been missing for two months” something that never happens in the finished movie, which appears to take place over the course of a couple days. Some of the changes are just baffling. In one trailer released last year, Morbius attacks a group of thugs and says “I... am... Venom!” before quipping “I’m just kidding, it’s Dr. Michael Morbius at your service!” That’s a dumb joke and a pretty shameless attempt to connect this movie to the wider Sony Spider-Man universe, but at least it’s something. In the actual film, Morbius still says “I... am... Venom!” but that’s it; the punchline is completely missing. Why would he call himself Venom? What is the point? What is the point of any of this? Just a few months ago, Sony was riding high on the success of Spider-Man: No Way Home, which brought together different Marvel franchises into a singular movie that somehow became more than just fan service; it was a legitimately moving film about heroism and brotherhood. No Way Home was like watching a wire walker pull off a seemingly impossible physical stunt; there was all this tension and excitement, followed by absolute elation when they actually pulled it off. Morbius is like watching an incompetent juggler throw six knives in the air and then get stabbed by each of them on the way down. -Morbius is rated PG-13, which means it is a film about a bloodsucking monster in which there is basically no blood. That pretty much says it all, doesn’t it?"
"Apr 1, 2022",NEUTRAL," Dr. Michael Morbius is an impressive guy. Since childhood he’s suffered from a rare genetic condition that requires three blood transfusions every day. That hasn’t kept him from inventing artificial blood (it’s blue, not red) and winning a Nobel Prize. He turned down the award. He doesn’t think he deserved it, since he’s yet to find a cure for that rare condition, which also afflicts his best friend. He’s also good at origami. With the help of some vampire bats, he thinks he may have come up with a cure. Martine, the fellow doctor he’s in love with, urges caution. Wait, caution in a superhero movie? Good luck with that. “We have to push the boundaries,” Morbius tells her, “take the risks. Without that, there is no science, no medicine, no breakthroughs at all.” Morbius injects himself with a cocktail of vampire bat DNA and human DNA, then bumps up against the law of unintended consequences. Let’s just say that there are ways in which he’s more of a batman than Batman is — or at least a vampire batman. You don’t want to be the flight attendant asking what his beverage selection is. As Morbius, Jared Leto has all the hair he lacked in “House of Gucci” and gets to look haunted and soulful. He does that well. (It’s a toss-up between Leto and Cillian Murphy for male actor with most beautiful eyes in the movies.) It’s true that in a medical-man superhero face-off with Dr. Strange, Dr. Morbius would be a serious underdog. He’s more likable, unless you’re in the vicinity of a blood bank. Adria Arjona, as Martine, doesn’t have much more to do than look concerned. She’s not especially good at it. Matt Smith, who was the creepy boyfriend in “Last Night in Soho,” plays the best friend. Sidekicks in superhero movies do just fine. Best friends, not so much. They’re up there with Spinal Tap drummers for job security. Tyrese Gibson, as a stern FBI agent, is more furious than fast. Even at 104 minutes, practically a short by superhero-movie standards, “Morbius” feels draggy. Daniel Espinosa (”Easy Money,” “Life”) directed. Also unusual for a superhero movie, it feels earnest. This honors the character of Morbius but rather violates the spirit of the genre. The movie’s not entirely without humor. There’s a nicely underplayed Venom reference, and when Martine offers Morbius some coffee, he says, “No, thanks, I quit caffeine.” What makes the joke funny is that we’ve been seeing Morbius chugging from blood bags. The sight is disturbing, even more than the filmmakers presumably intend. It’s easy enough to see the various influences “Morbius” derives from: vampire movies, werewolf movies, “Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,” Spider-Man, the whole science-gone-wrong tradition. But the sight of those plastic bags as drinking vessels, that really is original. That doesn’t mean the originality is welcome. Directed by Daniel Espinosa. Written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless; based on comic book characters created by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane. Starring Jared Leto, Matt Smith, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris, Tyrese Gibson. At Boston theaters, Kendall Square, suburbs. 104 minutes. PG-13 (violence, frightening images, brief strong language)."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEUTRAL," Superheroes are getting moodier. The idea of ‘dark’ comic-book adaptations isn’t exactly new, but lately they’ve stepped up a gear, with Matt Reeves’ extraordinarily emo The Batman, and Marvel’s venture into the murky morals of Moon Knight. Sony’s latest MCU-adjacent Spidey-villain spin-off attempts to jump on this tone-shifting bandwagon, focusing on their most bloodthirsty of anti-heroes: a living vampire. Unlike the hapless Eddie Brock, the other anti-hero of a franchise once unfortunately named the Sony Pictures Universe Of Marvel Characters (or ‘SPUMC’), Dr Michael Morbius is actively looking for his superpower. A medical savant, Nobel Prize rejector, artificial blood creator and terminal blood-disorder patient, he uses the super-important anticoagulants in the blood of vampire bats (don’t think too deeply about the science stuff; Morbius’ script certainly doesn’t) to develop a cure, which transforms his emaciated, fragile body into a powerful, muscular one. Just one problem — he now needs human blood to survive. It’s saying something when your most grounded performance in years is as a superhuman vampire, but that is strangely true of Jared Leto, here finding a quiet sincerity that’s far less showy than the distracting accents (House Of Gucci) and messianic tendencies (WeCrashed) of more recent roles. The main trio of him, Matt Smith (Morbius’ pal Milo) and Adria Arjona (playing fellow doctor Martine Bancroft) are woefully under-developed; outside of their relationship to Morbius, Milo and Martine’s character-development is non-existent. He is forced into the mould of cartoonish villain (the kind of which Smith can do in his sleep, but still proves unsatisfying); she ends up nothing more than a disposable love-interest. Visually, Morbius does some interesting things with its titular hero’s powers. His superspeed is signified by a trailing haze around him, which doesn’t entirely work, but the use of slow-mo to pick moments out of the hectic set-pieces is effective — an extended fight and flight through a subway station being a particular standout. Seeing his echo-location powers ricochet off walls, ripple across New York City and pump through the air as he tracks a heartbeat is also cool. It’s just a shame we didn’t see him get to grips with it all — instead, his abilities are explained through an exposition dump, and seemingly mastered instantly. All of this falters in a nosedive of a final act, during which any sense of climactic action is masked completely by incessant swarms of bats, poorly rendered breaking glass and blurry, crumbling buildings. Morbius’ core concept is strong — two friends close enough to be brothers, bonded by their shared suffering, who’ll do anything to spend one day feeling truly alive rather than at death’s door. Unfortunately, it’s not properly supported by any other element of the film, with messy action, wafer-thin characters and an even slighter plot letting down what could have been a lean, dark, interesting instalment in the SPUMC. And don’t even get us started on those unforgivable post-credit stings."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," Morbius--Jared Leto certainly has the physique and facial bones to play the title character in this Marvel flick. His performance as the hapless vampiric hematologist is good, too; quiet and haunted yet not oppressive, tinged with grim humor. The movie, however, could use a transfusion of originality platelets. ...and eventually headlined Marvel titles of his own. Like Barnabas Collins in Dark Shadows, he was a reluctant and tormented blood-drinker. Michael had brought on his condition, which includes superhuman strength and batlike gliding and echolocation ability, through a serum intended to cure the rare blood disease that was killing him. He craved blood but didn't want to hurt anyone, and, as with The Lizard (with whom Morbius notably clashed), Spidey empathized with him and tried not to harm him. There are other strong performances in the film, directed by Daniel Espinosa from a script by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (the team behind 2014's Dracula Untold). Matt Smith slyly plays Milo, Michael's mega-rich pal and research patron, who suffers from the same disease and soon notices the same side effects from Michael's serum, but feels less guilt over his bloodlust. Adria Arjona has a lovely sober quality as Martine, Michael's partner and romantic interest; her gravity seems to bring out a hint of playfulness in Leto. I really wanted to like this one; I'm fond of the comic character. And for the first half or so it cruises along enjoyably enough, though there's nothing really new to it, just standard spooky gothic flourishes. The corn is as high as a vampire's eye, too; repeatedly, when they're in bloodsucker mode, both Michael and Milo strike a scary pose and go ""RAAAAAH!"" like the bully kid in A Christmas Story, and after a while they seem like the performers in a Halloween haunted house. Then, as the movie progresses, the questionable logic increases. Why, for instance, would a boat on which secret medical experiments were being conducted require a large team of heavily armed mercenaries? Why would Michael want to commandeer a counterfeiting workshop's equipment to adapt into scientific equipment? In the later scenes, as Michael and Milo battle in the shadowy streets of New York--The Batman has nothing on this movie for gloominess--Morbius descends into an unexciting muddle. It has a truncated, cut-down feel to it, a suspicion supported by the presence of scenes in the trailer that didn't show up in the finished film. The most disappointing of these is the paucity of Michael Keaton, as Adrian Toomes aka The Vulture; he's shown in the trailer and I figured that if nothing else worked in the movie, Keaton would at least goose a little life into it. But [spoiler alert!] he only appears very briefly at the very end, and adds almost nothing to the picture (unless I nodded off when he said it, even the line he speaks in the trailer was cut). In the sequel, if there is a sequel, I certainly hope Keaton gets a much bigger role."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," Morbius wasn’t good: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The rottenness of the tomatoes was signed by the critics, top and otherwise. But the ways in which it isn’t good are, if not instructive, at least somewhat interesting. Because Morbius—indeed, the whole Spider-Man Expanded Universe thing that Sony Pictures is trying to pull off here, between Morbius, the Home trilogy starring Tom Holland as Spider-Man, and Tom Hardy’s Venom movies—gives us glimpses into the past, present, and future of comic book franchises. The thing about Spider-Man is that he’s a great character, equal parts identifiable and wish-fulfilment. He’s such a great character that in the 1990s during the comic book boom he could carry four separate monthly titles and his appearance in other titles would lead to a sales bump. He’s such a great character that his side-characters started getting spinoff books. And this is where the problems began. A character like Venom could maybe support that kind of interest, as Venom was a legit fan-favorite phenomenon. But a mid-tier guy like the vampiric villain Michael Morbius, a scientist introduced in the 1970s whose meddling with nature turned him into a blood-craving monster? There was no reason to slap him in his own series for three years through the early-to-mid ’90s, except to piggyback off of the otherworldly success of Spider-Man. It was one of the surest signs of a comic book bubble. Similarly, there’s no reason to make a movie about Dr. Michael Morbius except to piggyback off of the insane amount of business Spider-Man and Spider-Man-related films have done. There’s certainly no artistic reason for this movie to exist; it’s a paint-by-numbers origin story, tracking Morbius’s (Jared Leto) time as a child with a rare blood disease who grows into a scientist so desperate to cure what ails him and his friend, Milo (Matt Smith), that he’s willing to meld his own DNA with that of a vampire bat. Shockingly, things go wrong. Morbius becomes a vampire of sorts, insofar as he’s hungry for blood, though one without the limitations of a vampire. He has no fear of sunlight; neither holy water nor crosses nor garlic seem to have any effect upon him. Would a stake to the heart kill him? Perhaps, if it’s filled with coagulant sciencey something-or-other that will mumbledee mumbledum problem solved. Morbius hates what he’s become, even though drinking blood cures his disease and gives him the power to do backflips and, I guess, swim a couple dozen miles to shore? Equally shockingly, Morbius’s amoral pal, Milo, takes the serum and becomes very, very evil. Morbius must fight Milo, because that’s what one does when confronted by your friend who enjoys swishing about in his delightful new vampire skin. Morbius is the comic book movie equivalent of mid-’90s filler on comic-book store spinner-racks: It has nothing to recommend it, exactly, but it’s new and it’s taking up a spot in the release calendar and it kinda-sorta calls to mind other stuff you like. It’s close enough to competent that most people aren’t going to complain too much when they get home and read it, but once it’s been bagged, boarded, and filed in their longbox, they’ll never think of it again. It’s not original in the slightest; even parts of the score seem lifted almost note-for-note from Hans Zimmer’s work on the Dark Knight movies. The visuals aren’t ugly, exactly, but they’re not noteworthy either. One imagines the ghost of comics present taking you to a premiere party where people try to be merry while Kevin Feige pulls his ballcap over his eyes and mutters darkly about Sony’s complete failure to understand why the MCU formula works. I say it’s close-enough to competent because there’s one way in which it is distinctly incompetent. Sadly, it’s the only way that really matters for the movie, at least as far as the future of Sony is concerned. After the jump, let’s talk about the mid-credit scenes, shall we? There are two such scenes. In the first, the sky opens up in a way that calls to mind the multiversal rip in Spider-Man: No Way Home and all of a sudden Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) appears in a jail cell. Toomes, of course, was the villainous Vulture in Spider-Man Homecoming. The suggestion here is that Toomes has been pulled out of the Holland-verse and into the multiverse inhabited by Venom (who is name-checked and whose exploits are referenced by a pair of FBI agents earlier in the film) and Morbius. But that means that they all now exist in a universe where Spider-Man doesn’t exist—except, in the second mid-credits scene, Toomes tells Morbius that they should team up, and that Spider-Man has something to do with … something. I want to say this as plainly as possible: Despite the fact that I have seen all of these movies and have stayed for all of the mid-credit scenes, none of this makes a lick of sense. Neither as a piece of storytelling nor as a piece of universe-building (which, again, is the only reason this movie even exists, from Sony’s point of view). You have people hopping between realms of existence and they’re all hopping to the one where Spider-Man isn’t. What … what is the thought process here? What’s the end-goal? Why are we watching this? Why are they making it? Sony needs to figure this out, lest Sony chairman Tom Rothman be led by a ghastly spirit to a neglected stone in the Cinematic Cemetery, where he sees the only name more terrifying than his own engraved upon it—SPIDER-MAN."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," Movies from the Marvel Cinematic Universe may well be likened to theme park rides, but at least you know exactly what you’re getting from them. The MCU doesn’t produce many great films, but by adhering to a crowd-pleasing formula, it also isn’t responsible for flat-out disasterpieces. (Thor: The Dark World and Captain Marvel are exceedingly mediocre more than anything else.) And that’s where Sony Pictures comes in. As the owner of the film rights to Spider-Man and the extensive library of comic book characters associated with the superhero, Sony has created many of its own Marvel movies, and the results have been all over the place. The Andrew Garfield–led Spider-Man franchise was so underwhelming that the studio turned to Marvel Studios when rebooting the character—and the Kevin Feige–approved Tom Holland era has been considerably better—while the Venom films have emerged as a horny, chaotic celebration of symbiote-human companionship.  But the greatest virtue of the Sony-produced Marvel movies—their sheer unpredictability—can also be a curse, much like a Nobel Prize–winning doctor discovering a cure for a rare blood disease that turns him into a living vampire. That’s right: After several delays going back to 2020, Morbius finally will be in our lives this weekend. The fact that Sony pushed back Morbius more times than The New Mutants before settling on April Fools as a release date led to amusing speculation that the film was an elaborate prank devised by one of Hollywood’s most notorious trolls, Jared Leto, or that it was such a transcendent experience that humanity wasn’t ready to experience it. (We can thank Teen Wolf star Dylan O’Brien for sharing that compelling theory.) Alas, I can confirm that Morbius exists: It’s a movie that the studio spent actual money to make and that stars real actors, including, for some reason, beloved character actor Jared Harris.  And now that Morbius has been released, our worst fears have been realized. Sony has distributed a film that is so breathtakingly terrible, and so excruciating to watch, that it could be mistaken for one of the 10 plagues of Egypt. I truly believe that Morbius’s opening weekend is the three days of darkness foretold in the Bible. Our only recourse is to drive a proverbial stake through the heart of this “Marvel legend” and ensure that a sequel never sees the light of day.  At the start of the movie, we see Dr. Michael Morbius (Leto) capture a group of vampire bats in the jungles of Costa Rica, hoping to splice their DNA with that of humans to cure his blood disorder. This is obviously wildly experimental and dangerous, but Dr. Morbius is one of those badass doctors who receives a Nobel Prize but refuses to accept it, so rest assured he definitely knows what he’s doing. And so, along with his colleague and possible romantic interest Dr. Martine Bancroft—a character whom actress Adria Arjona earnestly compared to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez—Morbius tests the cure on himself in exotic international waters (a.k.a., 16 miles off the coast of Long Island). Suffice it to say, it doesn’t go well—as in, Morbius turns into a vampiric man-beast who drains the blood of everyone aboard the ship aside from Bancroft.  Horrified by his insatiable thirst for blood, Morbius tries to feast on the “artificial blood” that he previously invented for medicinal purposes, but soon realizes that it’s a temporary salve. At some point, Morbius will need the real thing again—or he’ll die. Meanwhile, his childhood best friend Milo (Matt Smith)—whose name is actually Lucien but Morbius decided to call him Milo when they were being treated at a nondescript Greek hospital run by Jared Harris (don’t ask)—has been bankrolling the human-bat DNA experiments and doesn’t care whether there are some gnarly side effects. He just wants a new lease on life, and so he takes the experimental cure against Morbius’s wishes. Milo/Lucien is way more chill about randomly sucking people’s blood, so Morbius must embrace his inner vampire to stop him.  Morbius: [Punches him square in the face.] Mmmmm, yes. [Licks the blood off the man’s face.] That injury will require an external nose splint administered by a medical professional. The splint will protect your nose and the surrounding cartilage as the bone heals. The recovery period is approximately three to four weeks, and it is vital that you avoid strenuous physical activity in the meantime. If you experience additional nausea or uncontrollable bleeding from the area, please contact your primary care provider.  Unfortunately, Morbius never comes close to nailing a tone, campy or otherwise. Whenever the film veers toward being a moody character study of a vampiric antihero, it throws in a wacky scene in which Morbius is called “The Vampire Murderer” on the news. (Why not just “The Vampire,” nondescript local news anchor?!) The movie simply exists because Sony needs to flesh out its nascent cinematic universe of Spider-Man-adjacent characters. The sad truth is that Venom might’ve followed a similar path if it weren’t for Hardy hijacking the project by jumping in a lobster tank and being a complete weirdo on every level.  If the film’s two mid-credits scenes featuring (minor spoiler alert) Michael Keaton’s Vulture are any indication, this isn’t the last we’ll see of Dr. Michael Morbius, who could find himself sharing screen time with other Spider-Man villains in the near future. Of course, this also wouldn’t be the first time that Jared Leto showed up in a superhero blockbuster with a host of villains—and we know how well that went. The only cure for Morbius is to put the eponymous vampire and this tepid attempt at a franchise out of its misery. Here’s hoping Sony Pictures reads the room and grants the prescription. Three days after its release, how’s the double album landing? And was Swift’s approach to this highly personal project successful? Nora Princiotti and Nathan Hubbard discuss on ‘Every Single Album.’ Nora and Nathan are here to dive into the album and discuss ""Fortnight,"" how Swift is grappling with her level of fame, and much more!"
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," Marvel's latest onscreen superhero is not, in the conventional sense, either ""super"" or a ""hero,"" but he does have an unorthodox ailment and a weird skill-set to separate him from mere mortals. His name is Morbius, and while watching his origin story, you may get the feeling that somewhere in the cinematic multiverse, wires got crossed. The film begins with a helicopter, transporting a cage to the sort of mist-shrouded isle you half expect King Kong to be inhabiting. But Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) is looking to capture smaller game as he approaches the mouth of a cave, hobbling with difficulty on two crutch-like canes.  Positioning himself behind the wires of the cage, he slices open the palm of his hand and, as a roar of batwings echoes from inside the cave, murmurs to the copter pilot ""if you're gonna run, do it now."" Born with a rare blood disease, Michael Morbius has spent his entire life working on two things — a cure, and origami paper-folding. Natch, it occurs to him to fold together bat and human DNA.  Let it be said that some side-effects from dabbling in ""chiropter-y"" are less ghastly than others. Bat DNA evidently gives you great cheekbones and abs to go with increased strength and speed.  Less salutary effects include new fangs that sprout from his gums with decades of decay baked in, and claws that erupt from his fingers pre-filthed. I mean, sure...why not? Except this is a man whose hair has the kind of sheen that comes from brushing it three times a day.  One other thing: he now needs to drink human blood every six hours. Happily, on his way to declining a Nobel Prize, Dr. Morbius invented ""artificial blood,"" though that only fools his system for a while.  If you're expecting a conventional Marvel movie, you should be aware going in that what Director Daniel Espinoza and his writers have come up with is more a horror flick with Marvel bells and whistles.  That means Leto's Morbius gets purplish smoke effects to go with those fang-baring snarls as he's riding air currents in subway tunnels, while the similarly afflicted Hyde to his Jekyll – a schoolboy chum played as an adult by an amusingly hopped-up Matt Smith, gets blue-ish vapor trails and snappier lines.  But there isn't much tension to their story. Or logic. At one point, Morbius overhears some counterfeiters passing fake $100s, and commandeers their printing press to make what appears to be an artificial-blood machine — because the technologies for fake-bills and fake-blood match up? Maybe that works better in a comic book.  Speaking of which, when the DC Extended Universe first announced that Twilight star Robert Pattinson would play the lead in The Batman in their corner of the superhero multiverse, it seemed like a nice inside joke — from Vampire-teen to Bat-man. But now that the Marvelverse has Leto going full Dracula, it seems as if the casting maybe could've gone the other way 'round.  Leto is as persuasively haunted by the dark side of vigilantism as Pattinson was, and as a result of corporate positioning, is maybe more determined to avoid being a villain. Not unlike Venom, Morbius was a bad guy when he first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man comics, back in the 1970's. He needs to be at least an anti-hero now, if a franchise is to be built around him. But bad guy/bat guy...who's to say? As the trailers reveal, another DC bat-guy, Michael Keaton, shows up in his non-batty baddie Marvel persona Adrian Toomes, just to mess with the heads of anyone trying to keep cinematic universes straight.  But bloodlines will have to be clarified in more robust ""Morbius"" episodes to come, this origin story being merely adequate, and by Marvel standards, slightly anemic. "
"Apr 1, 2022",NEUTRAL," A character from the Spider-Man/Venom part of the Marvel comic book universe, Michael Morbius (Leto) is a genius doctor with a debilitating illness that he believes can be treated by mixing human and vampire bat DNA. Maybe he’s not so much of a genius, then. Of course, after a few brief trials on mice he decides to test his radical serum on himself – with the help of fellow doc Martine (Arjona), who doesn’t seem too bothered that she’s breaking just about every medical rule by injecting him with his own cure on a boat filled with mercenaries in the middle of international waters (the location is so they’re not arrested for illegal experiments, the mercenaries are seemingly there so that when Morbius’s treatment makes him crave human blood, he has some morally dubious people to chomp on). It’s all rather stupid as Morbius realises he has vampire traits (sonic hearing, pointy teeth, bloodlust and some astonishing cheekbones) when he is hungry for blood, and looks like an Abercrombie & Fitch model the rest of the time as the bat blood relieves him of his previous illness and makes him buff. He tries to survive on a blood substitute of his own invention but discovers the effect lasts for a shorter time each time he uses it (much is made of the four hour life span of the fake blood so you expect that to lead to some against-the-clock plot twist but it doesn’t). Meanwhile, his childhood pal – extremely rich bloke Milo (Matt Smith, way better than the material) who has the same disease as Michael – wants to be cured himself and doesn’t seem quite as worried about the side effects or post-treatment diet. With Arjona given little to do as the damsel who may be in distress, and Jared Harris even less as Michael’s mentor, it’s left to Leto to hold the movie together. Unfortunately his performance is bland, emotionless and pretty forgettable, and he is saddled with a dull script and predictable plot that borrows from 100 (better) vampire and comic book movies. Even the action sequences are forgettable –a blur of CGI punches, grunts and building-to-building jumping sequences in which Michael leaves a colourful trail of wavy streamy ribbons in his wake that are supposed to show his flight skills but instead just look like the remnants of a retired cheerleader’s pom-pom. This movie is a 15 certificate in the UK and is aimed at older teens and adults. It does feature moments of horror and violence, including characters injured by claws and teeth. Morbius’s treatment means he becomes a creature similar to a vampire. There are lots of scenes in which his face changes and becomes almost hollow, he gains sharp teeth etc and he does kill/drink the blood of people (though little blood is actually seen)."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,It's impressive to live in a day and age where comic movies can still be this bad. 
"Apr 1, 2022",NEUTRAL," But its primary issue is that, much like so many non-Twilight and The Hunger Games YA adaptations from the 2000s and 2010s, titles like Eragon, Cirque du Freak: The Vampire’s Assistant, and The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones, it is engineered more to set up future tales than it is in building three-dimensional characters worth caring about. It is the dreaded prequel-to-a-sequel-that-will-never-come, and even though in this instance it’s safe to say that Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) will undoubtedly return, I’m still sure my meaning is clear. Based on the comic book character created by writer Roy Thomas and designed by penciler Gil Kane, the film by director Daniel Espinosa (Safe House) gets credit for a bit more visual ingenuity than we’ve seen from most Sony-produced Marvel properties of late (Spider-Man: No Way Home, Venom: Let There Be Carnage). There are some boldly colorful flourishes, especially how the main character’s various unearthly powers are portrayed, and I found them suitably impressive. I also found the unintentional initial transformation of Morbius into his bloodthirsty superhuman alter ego to be surprisingly effective. Espinosa leans into the same kinetic go-for-broke tenacity he brought to his 2017 sci-fi horror yarn Life, a demonic otherworldly assault on a team of heavily armed mercenaries aboard darkened container ship aggressively realized with hushed intensity. Finally, there’s a splendidly loopy supporting turn from Matt Smith that had me grinning ear to ear. The former Doctor Who star plays Dr. Morbius’s childhood friend Milo and he is a looney hoot, greedily gobbling up each scene he appears in with malevolent, carnivorous relish. He brings energy to moments where it wouldn’t otherwise exist, doing such a fine job that he almost makes the film worthy of the matinee ticket price all by himself. The basic plot is still your standard comic book superhero origin story, only with a few vampiric flourishes. Afflicted with a rare blood disorder that causes his body to grow increasingly frail and will one day kill him, the brilliant Morbius is on the verge of a cure. By combining vampire bat and human DNA, he believes he has created a serum that will restore him to perfect health. With the aid of his assistant Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) and with Milo’s financial backing, Morbius tests his theories on himself in the secluded safety of international waters. That way, if anything goes wrong, no one can be held legally responsible if he were to inadvertently take his own life. But things go haywire in ways the physician couldn’t have anticipated: the serum leaves him seemingly cured of his affliction, possessing superhuman strength, and having an almost unquenchable thirst for human blood. All of this would be fine if either Espinosa or his screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (The Last Witch Hunter) appeared to care about what was going on or spent a bit more time fleshing out these characters instead of being overeager to race on to the next big thing. Morbius’s relationship with Bancroft happens the way it does because it has to for the plot to progress. The great Jared Harris pops in to add a hint of class and to vomit up some moralistic exposition, but that’s pretty much it. As for Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal as a pair of bumbling FBI agents, the less said about them the better. No, other than showing who Michael Morbius is and the tightrope suspended between healer and destroyer he must perilously walk, everything that transpires is like some feature-length coming-attractions reel. It’s all fragmentary sentences and annoying cliffhangers, and while there is a climactic battle between once-familial friends now turned mortal enemies, even that is an unfinished symphony with first and second movements but only the smattering of a third, and it’s frustratingly lacking an allegro. For all its stylistic flourishes, Morbius doesn’t have any bite. Considering this character’s background, that’s not a small issue. Heck, I’d go so far as to call it a bloody big one.

"Apr 1, 2022",NEUTRAL,"When you combine bad dialogue, questionable editing, and a dead-serious tone - the result is not exactly great."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," Credit where it is due, as much as 2018’s Venom felt like a shameless attempt by Sony to capitalize on Spider-Man-related box office potential without actually featuring the webhead, the poorly reviewed antihero spectacle was a wildly successful moneymaker. A sequel was made. It was also successful (and better reviewed). Morbius is another attempt to craft an antihero story based around a notable Spider-Man villain. I may be even less familiar with the Living Vampire’s solo adventures than I was with Venom’s, but surely real-life vampire, Jared Leto, would be up to the task of giving a film like this the kind of oddball jolt Tom Hardy enhanced his movies with. Well, this did not prove to be the case. One would think summing up the plot of this film could be even simpler following two years’ worth of trailers for this much-delayed film. As it stands, it’s both simple and hard to do, as the story presents nothing new for anyone that’s ever watched a superhero origin film. At the same time, there’s a lot of footage from the trailer not present in this film. Was there plenty of time to tinker with the final product, given all of the release date changes due to the pandemic (and possibly test screening reactions)? Indeed there was, and as a result, the final version of Morbius is as lifeless as a non-living vampire. The story concerns Dr. Michael Morbius (Leto), a genius with a rare blood disease. He’s the kind of guy who is so smart yet so committed to finding a cure for what ails him that he refuses the Nobel Prize and keeps experimenting (though he still shows up to Sweden because who doesn’t like a free Scandinavian vacation?). Things look to be taking a turn for the better, as Dr. M is finally able to create a serum that combines the properties of a vampire bat with human blood. Of course, one can’t just finalize this process in a lab in New York, so it’s off to international waters. You may know where this is going. The experiment “works” with a crazy side effect. As it turns out, in a world where superheroes and symbiotes exist, crossing DNA with a vampire bat totally turns Morbius into a vampire. Not a traditional vampire (not unlike Blade, he’s a daywalker), but one who gains powers such as super strength, flight, and “bat radar” by drinking blood. While it’s fortunate that the good doctor developed artificial blood (it’s blue!) he can feed on, that’s sadly not going to be enough. Oh, and there’s the other problem – Morbius’ surrogate brother, Milo (Matt Smith), has a real interest in what Morbius is up to, leading to killer results. I may not have been a big fan of the Venom films, but it is easy to see their appeal. Hardy is putting his all into an off-the-wall dual performance. That level of camp, fitted inside of a more traditional superhero movie plot, clearly worked well for audiences. With that in mind, I would be hard-pressed to understand what Morbius has to offer. Ideally, the X-factor would be having Leto embody this Living Vampire character. In the past few years, Leto managed to deliver his annoying/psychotic take on Joker as well as a live-action fashion-obsessed Super Mario in House of Gucci. Somehow, Leto’s livewire energy is nowhere to be found in this film. I can understand Dr. Morbius being a somewhat reserved character, but he never brings anything to this character resembling fun, whether in human or vampire form. The rest of the cast mostly follows suit. A requisite female love interest, Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona, 21 years younger than Leto), shares next to no chemistry with Michael and only speaks in the form of plot momentum. Jared Harris is around as a father figure. Al Madrigal and Tyrese Gibson play the only two detectives in New York, with cases taking them from the harbor to Midtown (filmed in Manchester). As an aside, Gibson, a presence I generally like in films, could not be more bored here, which is impressive for a performer who so easily leaves an impression elsewhere. The only actor attempting to bring life to this film is Matt Smith. Not playing a specific character from the comics (his role is influenced by Loxias Crown), Smith’s Milo follows the familiar concept of making the villain a meaner version of the hero. Still, Smith’s few moments to shine allow him to dive into the fun of being a bloodthirsty immortal who literally vamps it up as he relishes his newfound powers. With next to nothing to compliment this film, Smith at least adds something not terrible. Directed by Daniel Espinosa (Safe House, Life), there’s nothing here to suggest the work of a filmmaker whose passion for the character is finally being fully realized. If seeing a couple of slow-motion shots featuring Morbius in action is what you came for, this movie has those and an additional 103 minutes around them (including two clumsy mid-credit scenes). Sure, that makes for a mercifully short superhero film of this quality. Still, given the investment a studio puts in something like this, it would be great to get decent action or horror out of a Marvel vampire movie. Instead, Morbius is always in a rush, eliminating the possibility of better character work, suspense, or any natural rhythm to connect with. Frequently, things feel pretty slapdash, with certain scenes barely making any sense, as if the film has been trimmed down to offer the most bang for one’s buck one can get while relying on the most minimal runtime possible for Morbius to still make some sense. Even the visual effects fail to leave much of an impression, between the blurry mush of vampires traveling at high speeds and the opportunity to give Leto and Smith wacky vampire faces. There has to have been a vision for this film that would find a way to incorporate a more engaging lead performance into a story full of cool vampire action and possibly some horror elements to distinguish this superhero movie from the pack. We all know this is possible, as Blade was a huge evolutionary point for the genre back in 1998. If anything, it should be easy enough just to make something competent. Morbius doesn’t even live up to those lowest of expectations. My diagnosis: bad moviemaking."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEUTRAL," Despite the long hours that Sony Pictures have spent pumping life into the veins of their Marvel properties, the resulting films - whether box office behemoths like the Spiderman franchise or murky gunk like Venom - have, of late, been pretty crappy. It means that to non-comic types like your critic, the notion of having to first watch then conjure a few hundred words about Sony’s latest second-tier MCU anti-hero…well, I have hair to wash, too.. Wasting away in the grips of a degenerative blood disorder, Michael Morbius is driven to find a cure not just to relieve his own suffering, but to better the life of his friend, Lucien, aka ‘Milo’. They first form a bond as bed-bound boys under Dr Emil Nikols (Jared Harris), and remain chums into pained adulthood, where Morbius (a skeletal Jared Leto) becomes a Nobel prize-refusing researcher and Milo (played with menace, even when being nice, by Matt Smith) a couch-bound invalid. Of course, it’s a comic-book trope as old as comic-books; while being questioned by Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal, playing the two dumbest detectives in film history, a blood-craving Michael scowls, “You wouldn’t like me when I’m hungry,” a pointed reference to the Bruce Banner/Hulk mythology from which Morbius is drawn. Jared Leto does as much with the duality of the character as asked of him, committing to make-up prosthetics and stepping aside for his CGI stand-in when required. While the film won’t upgrade the property from that second-tier comic realm alongside the likes of Venom (or, for DC fans, Swamp Thing or The Shadow), there is a layered psychology to Morbius which may be further drawn out in future (and better) iterations. It is almost a shame that Morbius is tied to the Marvel universe at all, given that the inclusion brings with it franchise expectations that don't serve the character’s key traits at all. "
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," Comic book movies can be many things, ranging from grim and dark to zany and caper-ish, but it needs to at least be entertaining. And Morbius is not entertaining. Or it should have at least one character whose fate you care about. Morbius doesn’t have that either. If the movie gods had any mercy, they would’ve killed them all so they can never return for a sequel or crossover – no such luck, FYI. A new entry into the burgeoning Sony/Marvel shared universe, Morbius exists in the same world as the two Venom movies starring Tom Hardy, which are now connected to the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies, which makes them tangentially related to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  Michael Morbius (Leto) is a gifted doctor whose life ambition is to cure himself of a rare blood disorder that afflicts him and childhood best friend Milo (Matt Smith). The illness renders him and Milo physically impaired, gaunt and with a death sentence hanging over them. Along with doctor/love interest Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), he embarks on a dangerous experiment of splicing human and bat DNA. Of course it goes wrong and he turns into vampire, one which needs a blood infusion every few hours but can stroll around in the sun. His newfound powers stir desperation and envy in Milo, just as Michael contends with his new physical strength, and the cost it comes with, that of being a monster. Never before has Jared Leto turned in such an unmemorable performance, one that which allows his cartoonish House of Gucci effort seem inspired by comparison. Is it Leto’s fault? Not even. You can lay that blame at the feet of screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless and director Daniel Espinosa. And just to spread the blame, the producers too. The script and direction is so bland that even Leto couldn’t inject any charm, menace or a skerrick of personality into a character that’s supposed to be a conflicted genius-vampire-hero. The action sequences are barely discernible as it leans into the whole they’re-so-fast-they’re-just-whiffs-of-smoke effect, which quickly becomes tiresome when it’s the only trick in the book. And it appears as if the production ran out of visual effects money and dug up a floppy disk with the old vamp face filter from Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s first season. Morbius was originally due to be released in mid-2020 and it’s shocking the studio didn’t take the extra time to punch it up. Or, here’s a scary thought, what if they did and this was the best they could do. Now, that’s truly monstrous. Both a great sports movie and unconventionally riveting romantic drama, Challengers volleys the audience back and forth to reveal what is riding on a tennis match, writes Leigh Paatsch."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,Boring! And thats a death knell for anything coming out of Marvel Comic Universe. 
"Apr 1, 2022",POSITIVE,"Other than being predictable with repetitive visual effects, I found MORBIUS intriguing."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," It’s a tale as old as time. A brilliant doctor suffering from a life-threatening condition crafts one last-ditch attempt at curing their ailment, but the results dream up a nightmarish new reality far beyond their control. Dr. Michael Morbius embodies this anti-hero treatment in Sony’s latest ploy for a cinematic universe Morbius. Latest might be putting it kindly, as the vampire anti-hero origin story sat on the shelf for nearly two years due to the pandemic.  Following in the footsteps of crowdpleasers Venom: Let There Be Carnage and Spider-Man: No Way Home, Morbius marks a bold odyssey of expansion. The brooding vampire is a minor cog in the mainstream superhero marketplace, placing extra responsibility on Sony and their filmmaking team to establish an arresting first chapter in a new saga. Instead, Morbius delivers a toothless and aggressively soulless descent into beige superhero formula.  Before the film drives off the rails, Morbius presents glimmers of life for the all-too-commonplace genre. The film is surprisingly sincere in its anti-hero approach, crafting Michael into a well-meaning scientist who finds himself consumed by his failed experiment. Seeing a protagonist toiling with his super-powered affliction rather than being enhanced by it offers a refreshing perspective to explore onscreen.  Unfortunately, director Danny Espinosa rarely gets a chance to represent Morbius’ gothic sensibility. The film drapes every frame in a thick coat of bleak lighting choices and murky visuals, a style that vyes for the macabre but looks more like a bad TV pilot. Espinosa and company seem petrified of embracing a darker vision onscreen, with the few horror setpieces lacking the palpable tension one would expect. His flat presentation represents a studio-for-hire filmmaker who does not imbue an artistic voice into the project.  Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless collaborate on a similarly listless screenplay. The nucleus of Michael Morbius’ story radiates promise, taking an intimate dive into a tragic anti-hero who pays the price for trying to cure his deadly disease. His struggles as a doctor morphed into a flesh-eating monster never receives the time it needs to breathe onscreen. Mixed with dialogue exclusively made of exposition jargon, Morbius passes by without ever drawing a genuine attachment from audiences. I know star Jared Leto is somewhat of a punching bag in critical pundits, with several ostracizing the actor’s penchant for over-the-top performances. I will say it’s refreshing to see the actor step into a more grounded figure that fits the performer’s brooding energy. However, Leto finds himself stuck on a sinking ship. Neither he nor capable supporting players Matt Smith and Adria Arjona have any room to create distinct characters within the droning screenplay. It’s all so monotone and drab, leaving everyone in the cast looking around waiting for something to do.  Capped off with an incomprehensible CGI-slugfest of a finale, Morbius showcases the superhero genre in its most generic state. If the character continues forward in future sequels, I hope the creative team develops a more succinct vision for who the character should be.  We hope you're enjoying BRWC.

"Apr 1, 2022",NEUTRAL," Like the recent “Venom” movies, the Marvel entry “Morbius” is a Spider-Man villain origin story. It’s a full-blown horror flick about a brilliant doctor, played by Jared Leto, who attempts to cure his own blood disease, only to unintentionally turn himself into a super vampire. It’s watchable, but the by-the-numbers execution leaves “Morbius” just a bit anemic. In the Judd Apatow Netflix comedy “The Bubble,” a bunch of self-absorbed actors hole up on a quarantined movie set to film a “Jurassic World”-style sci-fi flick during the Covid pandemic. There are laughs to be had, but much of the material is delivered with sledgehammer blows. “The Bubble” doesn’t burst, but there isn’t enough funny material for this overlong showbiz lampoon. Broadway buffs will enjoy the Disney+ musical comedy, “Better Nate Than Ever.” Newcomer Rueby Wood plays a middle school theater nerd who sneaks off to New York to audition for a Broadway show. It’s all razzmatazz and artificial sweetener…but is likable enough for musical theater fans. Omar Epps and Michael Ealy headline the well-intentioned but meandering social drama, “The Devil You Know.” Epps plays a former addict trying to straighten out his life, but his brother’s involvement in a crime becomes a roadblock. “The Devil You Know” is well-acted but undone by poor dramatic pacing. The Netflix animated offering “Apollo 10 ½: A Space Age Childhood” is a wistfully nostalgic film for anyone old enough to remember NASA’s moon landing in 1969. Writer/director Richard Linklater recounts his remembrances of the era through the fanciful story of a Houston kid secretly sent to the moon just before the Apollo 11 team’s mission. “Apollo 10 ½” is an affectionate walk down memory lane."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," Morbius exists because Sony owns the big-screen rights to Marvel intellectual property that originated with Spider-Man, and by god they’re gonna use them. Just because Sony ran its own Spider-Man franchise into the ground eight years ago and subsequently let Marvel Studios feed them their lunch with a superior and beloved version of the wall-crawler doesn’t mean its time to sell it all back to Disney. There’s a whole catalog of recognizable Spider-Man villains to turn into antiheroes and allies to turn into icons. Why a blockbuster starring this fourth-string quasi-vampire character was Sony’s chosen path after the surprise success of 2018’s Venom is anybody’s guess, and it isn’t clear from watching the film that those involved in making it knew the answer. That said, even a bad idea executed with faith and ambition can be a worthwhile movie. The problem with Morbius is that it’s a bad idea executed at a breathtakingly bad level. Sony’s marketing promises “a new Marvel legend.” In this case, it’s Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto), a brilliant scientist suffering from a debilitating blood disease that has left him physically disabled and under constant threat of early death. He grew up in a little home for the similarly afflicted along with his buddy Lucien (Matt Smith), whom he renamed Milo for some reason. They’re cared for by Emil Nicholas (Jared Harris), a kindly doctor who serves as their father figure. In a terrible flashback, we see young Michael (Charlie Shotwell) win a game of chess against himself (which I guess means he’s a genius) before shipping off to earn his Ph.D. in biology by the age of 19. Morbius changes the world by inventing fake blood but otherwise devotes his life to curing himself and Milo. For whatever reason, that cure comes in the form of genetically splicing his DNA with that of a vampire bat, thus becoming a vampire man who needs blood but refuses to kill. Then Milo gets a whiff of the serum and decides he’s a vampire man who wants to kill. They fight about it a little bit. It’s pretty dumb. The trailers for Morbius have played in front of just about every single movie for the past two years, and the marketing spend probably dwarfs the GDP of most red states. It’s impossible to escape the movie despite the fact that it looks bad. Having seen the film, it’s surprising just how bad it is and, therefore, how enjoyable it actually becomes. Director Daniel Espinosa (Safe House) seems to have been forced into multiple rounds of reshoots because scenes don’t feel remotely congruous at any given time. The story beats found in most half-assed origin tales are present but feel rushed through at great speed for no discernible reason, and important events constantly take place offscreen. Given his executive producer credit and constant presence in the marketing, it’s clear the film was sold to Leto as a way to star in a Marvel film without the responsibilities inherent to entering the Marvel Cinematic Universe proper. After all, Tom Hardy has had tremendous success steering the Venom ship into its unique position among a constellation of successful franchises. He’s synonymous with that role, and nobody can tell him where to show up next. It’s easy to see why Leto was sold this bill of goods, but in no universe is playing Morbius a similar opportunity as playing Venom, who remains one of the most popular Marvel characters period. Nowhere is that clearer when comparing Morbius with the first Venom film: They both follow the same basic beats, but Venom is at least hysterical, self-deprecating and deeply weird. Morbius is weird, too, but not in the same way. None of the comedy seems to come intentionally. My favorite laugh moments are when it directly rips off Batman Begins, including its score. I also laughed at the two FBI agents, Simon Stroud (Tyrese Gibson) and Alberto Rodriguez (Al Madrigal) who do literally nothing the entire movie. Oh, and the scene where Milo, amped up on blood, gets dressed in fancy clothing while dancing to pop music in his apartment. That’s funny in a good way. Less funny are the scenes where Leto and Smith walk down the street doing their best to seem disabled, which are a bit awkward. Stray ADR work makes for amusing moments. Kudos for the title card “INTERNATIONAL WATERS,” which is always a great way of signifying something illegal is about to happen. It’s all so inexplicable and kind of wonderful in just how bad it is but only to the discerning audience who likes bad things. You probably have to be on its level, which means completely devoid of expectations or standards. That’s me, I guess. Morbius just keeps going until it abruptly ends, setting up a sequel I’ll probably watch and a potential spinoff about Leto teaming up with another Spider-Man villain to do battle for some reason they’ll probably never figure out. That won’t stop them, though, and it won’t stop me from plunking down another $15 to watch whatever incarnation of the Sinister Six Sony finally manages to concoct. It’s difficult to go too hard on something like Morbius because ultimately, I am the problem."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,Morbius is like a can of flat soda. 
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," MORBIUS is part of the SPIDER-MAN-verse of big-budget Marvel-inspired movies from Sony Pictures/Columbia, though on a certain aesthetic level, it’s more reminiscent of those days when Cannon Films and Roger Corman attempted to bring the publisher’s superheroes to the screen. There’s a decided B-movie feel hanging over the whole thing, no matter how much gratuitous CGI it throws at us. Simply put, this is not the preferred comics-based bat man to see on screens right now. I’m not familiar with the comics that inspired MORBIUS, though Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless’ credit for both “screen story and screenplay” suggests liberties have been taken. It opens with a sufficient bang as Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto), a brilliant scientist debilitated by a blood disease, arrives at a Costa Rican cave to trap a colony of vampire bats that are crucial to his research. Before we learn of their importance, the movie flashes back to Morbius’ childhood in a Greek clinic, where he began a lifetime friendship with similarly afflicted Loxias Crown, whom he comes to call Milo. Back in the present, Milo (Matt Smith) is bankrolling Morbius’ experiments involving the synthesizing of anticoagulants in the bats’ saliva into a serum that can cure himself, Milo and potentially countless others. Instead, as anyone familiar with horror-movie standards knows, testing the drug on himself causes Morbius to become a character who’s part human and part vampire, and also part Spider-Man (able to leap around with superhuman strength and agility) and part Hulk (given to rage-screaming transformations). The rules of his condition, and how he deals with them, are pretty shaky, and change depending on the needs of the plot. What’s for sure is that after taking out a squad of mercs on a ship that then drifts into a New York harbor (it’s not called the Demeter, but the Murnau, wink wink), Morbius becomes determined to keep his inner monster at bay until he can find a solution to his condition. Complicating matters: Milo, envious of the physical improvement and buff physique the serum has given Morbius, steals some of it and also vamps out, though he has fewer compunctions about restraining his new dark side. That provides the central conflict, shot through with themes of humanity and responsibility that have been seen in countless past films about vampires, Dr. Jekyll and other supernatural beings, and get little in the way of imaginative reconception here. One of the joys of so many of the Marvel movies, including the three Tom Holland SPIDER-MEN, is how they have found ways to ask very human dramatic questions in the midst of all the spectacle. In MORBIUS, everything is pro forma, playing out exactly as you expect it will, with the revelation of Milo as the story’s villain handled in an especially haphazard, offhanded manner. Smith seems to be having fun in a role given no quirks to distinguish him from countless past semihuman/power-mad villains, while Leto, underplaying some of the time, does his best to invest gravity into a role with only the most standard of shadings. Everyone else has purely functional roles to play, including Adria Arjona as Dr. Martine Bancroft, a colleague of Morbius’ who tries to help him out, Jared Harris as Dr. Emil Nicholas, Morbius and Milo’s longtime personal physician, and especially Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal as a couple of FBI agents on Morbius’ case. Gibson is the bad-ass one, Madrigal delivers the (mild) wisecracks and the duo have absolutely no impact on the storyline whatsoever. Director Daniel Espinosa previously guided street-level crime dramas like SNABBA CASH, SAFE HOUSE and CHILD 44, which would seem to make him well-suited for a Manhattan-set vampire epic. However…actually, let’s talk about the Manhattan thing first. The occasional helicopter shot of the real thing cannot hide the fact that MORBIUS was clearly shot somewhere other than the Big Apple (London, as it turns out); with the budget this movie had, you’d think they’d be able to set a key action setpiece in a New York City subway station that actually looks like a New York City subway station. And speaking of the budget, any attempt at gritty urban atmosphere is visually drowned out by all the digital trickery on view, as Morbius and Milo (whose vamp faces are almost all done via computers, not prosthetics) leave trails of CGI swirlies whenever they’re in monster mode, and especially when they fight. This reduces a number of the action sequences, particularly the climactic blowout, to incoherent blurs. Shot nearly three years ago, MORBIUS has clearly been subject to a lot of recutting and possibly reshooting, given the number of moments in its two trailers that appear nowhere in the film itself. These include appearances by a key character from a past SPIDER-MAN adventure who, those previews suggest, once had a greater role in the proceedings. In the final cut, he’s seen only in a pair of mid-end-credits bits that appear to have been hastily put together in the wake of SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME’s huge success. They make it clear that Morbius, no surprise, will be back in a future movie or movies, and also that–no surprise to anybody who sees this one–he’s not going to be the headliner."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,A living vampire and a lifeless movie.
"Apr 1, 2022",NEUTRAL," The worst cardinal sin that a film could commit is being forgettable. Bad movies at least evoke an emotional response and stay with viewers, if only out of petty anger, while good ones enrapture audiences and engage various feelings, creating a memorable experience and an emotional association that remains for years. But the worst is when a film dissipates in the mind shortly after watching it. The Spider-Man-adjacent “Morbius” isn’t totally unmemorable, as it has a few affecting moments that should elicit some response from viewers, but a lack of character arcs and interesting relationships dilutes most of its better elements. Audiences will remember that they saw “Morbius,” for good or ill, but its lack of impact gives such memories a short shelf-life. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) is a scientific genius and pioneering doctor driven by a need to cure his rare blood disease. There’s a ticking clock as his condition worsens — a desperation also felt by his childhood friend Milo (Matt Smith), who suffers from a similar affliction and uses his vast wealth to fund Morbius’ work. Morbius invented artificial blood, which revolutionized the world and is used by the military, hospitals and more, but even that mammoth discovery can’t remedy his disorder. While pursuing other avenues to treat his illness, Morbius discovers that certain anti-coagulating properties of vampire bats could help if there were a way to splice the animal’s DNA with human DNA. Working with Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), the duo conducts experiments that are promising until they go awry, leaving Morbius as an almost feral creature with heightened abilities and a strong need to drink blood. The artificial blood isn’t enough to slake the thirst in the long term, and soon, authorities are on the lookout for a vampire terrorizing New York City. Honestly, “Morbius” is a fine movie. There are major plot contrivances and other issues, but nothing so egregious that it makes for an unpleasant time. There just isn’t enough for audiences to sink their teeth into, so any spectacle, fights and deaths land with a whimper. Director Daniel Espinosa (“Safe House,” “Life”) gets good enough performances from his cast to keep viewers’ attention, but he probably would’ve benefitted from some greater flourishes and certainly from more substantive characters in Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless’ script. Each person is a clearly defined type that makes them readily identifiable, such as the tortured genius, the saintly friend, the kind mentor, the reckless wild card, the dutiful FBI agent, etc. Unfortunately, the characters don’t have much shading beyond that. Smith’s Milo has a greater range and depth of emotions (while seemingly being one of the few people having any fun) that makes his character stand out, no matter how clichéd his story may be. And Leto wears the angsty gothic scientist well; he’s the cinematic archetype of the enhanced person who constantly debates people over whether his newfound powers are a gift or a curse. He also adds a palpability to Morbius’ blood addiction — a compulsion that he struggles to control lest people get hurt. Basically, he’s like a Hot Topic Hulk. Arjona, on the other hand, is given very little to do despite being the audience surrogate who cares about Morbius’ condition. She does well in the limited capacity, trading barbs with Leto with some ease and then being very frightened by his vampiric issues or when used as bait. But there’s no strong chemistry or connective tissue between the two doctors; it mostly feels like placeholders that will be filled in later with more nuance and emotional bonds. One of the better elements of “Morbius” is that the dogged federal agent (Tyrese Gibson) and his comedy-relief partner (Al Madrigal) don’t waste time arguing the validity of vampires — they find blood-drained corpses and are quick to accept what they’re dealing with. It saves time, sidesteps that tedious discussion and is very much appreciated. And that is a testament to another strength of “Morbius”: The film moves along at a quick pace, foregoing any fake mystery or prolonged plot elements to get to its central conflict and action sequences. I’m not sure about the actual timecode, but it feels like Morbius becomes a living vampire within the movie’s first 20 minutes. Espinosa trusts that the audience knows what the film is about, so he doesn’t waste time with much of the usual filler involving disbelief or debates. This is a double-edged sword, of course, because in better hands, those are the moments that make for interesting characters and engaging dynamics. But if “Morbius” can’t have those, then it’s perfectly happy getting to the fireworks factory as quickly as possible, which means that audiences are treated to some fun vampire sequences that are visualized in an interesting (and comic book-y) manner, with trails of light and color following along with the super sped-up motions, creating a cool aesthetic blur and after-image that’s like the throwing daggers effect from “V for Vendetta.” There are a bunch of skirmishes and such (even if they’re essentially basic variations on each other) that provide some eye candy, though the use of speed ramping inadvertently reveals that the CG characters look far more cartoonish than anticipated. “Morbius” isn’t bad. It moves swiftly through its 104-minute runtime, and there are enough good parts that allow for a few moments of entertainment, but it’s unlikely that the whole movie will remain in viewers’ memories for long. Morbius is a character who’s caught between two worlds (man and monster), and his movie is stuck in a similar liminal space that ultimately makes it unremarkable.

"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," The entertainment giant spent the past winter watching Marvel Studios rule the multiplexes (during a gotdamn Omicron outbreak!) with their former, franchise cash cow Spider-Man, as Spider-Man: No Way Home raked in over a billion dollars worldwide as Marvel’s version of Peter Parker joined forces with their previous Peter Parkers. That’s gotta hurt. It’s like watching your exes have a threesome with a new dude and they’re having a way better time with him. They may have lost Spider-Man, but they still got the Spider-Man universe (a universe they apparently also have to share with Disney). And they’ve been leaning in on making down-and-dirty flicks about the universe’s antiheroes, with two movies where Tom Hardy assumes the role of half-man/half-alien symbiote Venom and, soon, Dakota Johnson will play blind superheroine Madame Web. (Since this movie will also co-star Euphoria temptress Sydney Sweeney, Sony is also in the business of making comic-book movies fanboys can finally use as masturbatory material.) At the moment, the latest antihero ride for Sony is Morbius, at long last hitting theaters after a couple years of postponed release dates, due to either the pandemic or other, more high-profile superhero films on the horizon. (With The Batman still killing it in theaters, perhaps Sony thought they’d pick up curious moviegoers by dropping their own bat guy a few weeks later.) That pretty-ass pain in the ass Jared Leto plays the titular good/bad guy, a brilliant but physically handicapped doctor who’s best known for making life-saving, Nobel Prize-winning, artificial blood. After rounding up a bunch of bats from Costa Rica, he creates a serum that’ll hopefully cure him and his best friend/benefactor Milo (former Doctor Who time lord Matt Smith) of their debilitating ailments.  Of course, when he gets injected with the serum, he gets all bloodthirsty and kills a bunch of mercenaries on a boat. (Don’t worry — the mercenaries are dicks. We know this because one of them didn’t treat his beautiful colleague, played by Adria Arjona, with respect.) He spends most of the movie keeping his bloodthirstiness at bay, especially when dead bodies start piling up and FBI agents (played by the dull duo of Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal) start pursuing him. It’s kind of frustrating how Morbius is just a quick, grungy exercise in keeping the SSU — Sony’s Spider-Man Universe — running smoothly. Director Daniel Espinosa (Safe House, Life) and screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (Netflix’s Lost in Space reboot) feverishly set up the conflict, with Morbius immediately doing battle — which, of course, means a lot of city property gets torn up — with his buddy Milo, who takes the serum and turns into a petulant, murderous douchebag. (Morbius continues Sony’s tradition of giving these superhumans archvillains who are really just bitter-ass brats.) The execution is utterly transparent, creating this flimsy origin story so Leto’s living vampire can eventually become a flying, fugitive badass who — as the obligatory, post-credits scenes immediately establish — becomes an integral figure in the Spider-Man world. For an actor who’s notorious for doing too gotdamn much when he’s in character, Leto surprisingly keeps things chill with his performance. (I guess he learned it’s best to play it cool after showing his whole ass as Suicide Squad’s annoyingly extra Joker.) Even before he gets all ravenous, developing not only a taste for blood but also “the constitution of an Olympic athlete,” his Morbius is already a cocky, long-haired rebel. Yeah, Leto is pretty much Leto throughout this gotdamn thing.  There isn’t much there with Morbius, a lame, lazy actioner so forced and derivative that it feels like it came out in 2002 rather than 2022. But, hey, unlike those CGIed-to-hell Marvel movies, at least it looks like it was shot on actual soundstages. "
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," Indisputably, our cinemas are clogged with superheroes. Griping about a trend that’s just a Hollywood fact of life is almost trite, but in the case of Morbius, the dark and gloomy Jared Leto vehicle finally making it to theaters this weekend, I have to register a complaint. Morbius, a “living vampire” who can fly and has super-strength and -reflexes, is the least helpful superhero I have ever seen in a movie. He causes many problems, resolves almost none of them, and at no point does anything particularly altruistic. One might counter with the notion that Morbius, who exists alongside Venom as part of Sony’s nascent Spider-Man-themed universe, is an antihero: a super-being plagued by an edgy, dramatic past who is not consumed by a need to carry out the typical bits of derring-do. Plenty of interesting comic-book portrayals along those lines have cropped up in recent years—think of Jon Bernthal’s Punisher, or Ryan Reynolds’s wisecracking Deadpool. But Morbius is little more than an irritant, a grumpy, one-note CGI beastie who spends most of his movie pondering whether he should go full supervillain. Spoiler alert: Morbius never really answers that question. Even by the standards of the many monotonous origin stories that have been rolled out during this superhero boom, Daniel Espinosa’s film is a whiff, a half-hearted effort to create a character on a knife-edge between valor and villainy that instead ends up a portrait of a very annoying weirdo. Perhaps that’s par for the course given Leto’s track record in this genre—his take on the Joker in Suicide Squad, intended as gritty and menacing, felt gratingly obnoxious. His Morbius is not quite so over-the-top, but he’s still a charmless knockoff lead, a character who deserves to be quickly forgotten rather than brought into the Spider-Man fold. When audiences first meet him, Dr. Michael Morbius is a scientific genius on the brink of death, suffering from a rare blood disease that limits his movement and requires constant transfusions. His efforts to cure his condition have led him to develop artificial blood, a groundbreaking achievement that would probably be a far more interesting topic for the film to focus on. But Morbius cares most about healing himself, which he of course achieves by injecting himself with a serum of vampire-bat DNA. Suddenly, he’s super-strong, his reflexes are perfect, and there’s just one tiny side effect: He’s a fanged beast who thirsts for human blood every few hours. Leto, an actor who often makes a public meal of how committed he is to his roles, does his best to sell the monster within through lots of anguished screaming. For all his internal torment, however, Morbius is a dull creature switching between equally bland personae: the human Michael, puzzling over his predicament, and the vampiric Morbius, who roars at people with a highly unconvincing, computer-generated face. Neither achieves anything remotely positive. The only time Morbius seems fleetingly interested in working for the public good is when he stalks some shady-seeming gangsters to a lab where they’re making counterfeit goods—but he then reveals that he only wants to hijack their lab to carry out more of his experiments. Other than that, Morbius is useless. He guzzles artificial blood to try to stave off his addiction, though it is apparently a flimsy substitute for the real thing. He creates carnage wherever he goes, throwing cops around a subway station and inadvertently putting his lab partner, Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), in harm’s way whenever she tries to help him. Most crucially, his best friend, Milo (Matt Smith), who has the same blood condition, gets his hands on the serum and becomes a vampire as well, embracing his villainy and delivering many a florid monologue about how great it is to suck people’s blood out of their neck. Morbius is tasked with defeating him, but given that Milo is a problem of the doctor’s own creation, that’s the least he could do. Smith does his absolute best to wring a little fun out of his character, dancing around in smoking jackets and throwing himself into every action scene with aplomb, but it’s not enough to distract from the overall dour tone. When Leto is at his most maximalist, it helps if the movie matches him—the willingness to embrace exaggerated silliness is what made House of Gucci such an enjoyable ride, with Leto hamming it up right in the middle of all the chaos. Morbius is reflective of Leto’s much more self-serious side, and the film is thuddingly tedious as a result. For all his vampiric power, I encourage Dr. Morbius to return to the noble field of blood science, because it’s clearly the only thing he’s actually good at."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," It’s true: movies are magic. It’s just that people often forget that sometimes, magic is bad. Morbius is the kind of magic you’d want to keep a lid on: a two-hour spell that makes viewers forget it actually stars Jared Leto, one of the few men alive in danger of being too interesting, thanks to his widely publicized overcommitment to Method acting and a public persona that frequently evokes “benevolent cult leader” vibes. Unfortunately, Morbius isn’t a good showcase for his talents the way its Sony/Marvel predecessor Venom was a showcase for Tom Hardy, even though the two movies share a similar structure. And a movie that apes Venom without an unpredictable performance at the center, it turns out, is a pretty lousy time.  Like Venom, Morbius spins off a Spider-Man villain into a story that makes him the anti-hero of his own little corner of the world. (The film, as one gag from the trailers underlines, is set in the same universe as Venom.) Dr. Michael Morbius (Leto) is a brilliant scientist with a rare, debilitating blood disease, one that leaves him frail, unable to walk without support, and in regular need of blood transfusions. Dr. Morbius, we’re told, is one of the world’s foremost scientific minds, having developed a blue-tinged artificial blood that has “saved more lives than penicillin.” Yet he still has not found a cure for his disease — something he desperately wants, not for his own sake, but for his childhood friend Milo (Matt Smith), who suffers from the same disease and funds Morbius’ research through his wealth.  In a desperate attempt to test his first viable cure, Morbius uses himself as a guinea pig for a serum meant to rewrite his genome and make him into a hybrid human and vampire bat — an experiment that’s off the books and unethical. (If it wasn’t, someone probably would have asked him to say “human/bat chimera” out loud, and re-consider whether the experiment was a good idea.) With the help of colleague and love interest Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), Morbius “accidentally” turns himself into a Living Vampire — basically a regular vampire, but without the traditional church allergies.  Morbius is the kind of film where it would serve viewers well not to sweat the details. Anyone wondering about the specifics of Morbius’ disease or superpowers is better off not trying to parse the film’s thin explanations. This is a film set in New York City but very clearly shot in London, where the crew taped up a few subway signs in a Tube station wall and called it a day. The film only truly comes to life when Matt Smith’s Milo assumes his villainous role, learning what Morbius has become and taking the serum himself.  The newly vampiric Milo relishes the powers that horrify Morbius, enjoying the thrills of being superhuman, and casting off the scruples that keep Morbius feeding on artificial blue blood instead of real human blood. (The two of them repeatedly refer to this as drinking “red” or “blue,” which never stops being funny.) Herein lies the biggest problem for Morbius: The villain, who is not in the film nearly as much as he should be, is having the sort of fun Morbius ought to be having. Milo dances and preens every moment he’s on camera, in a performance that’s only marred by the CGI makeover both leads get when they vamp up, a choice that doesn’t seem much better than Buffy the Vampire Slayer-style prosthetics.  Smith’s dynamism painfully underlines the lack of imagination and energy elsewhere in the film. Plainly shot, with a score (and a scene or two) that shamelessly ape Batman Begins, Morbius comes across as algorithmically calibrated to enter the blockbuster market as smoothly as possible. Its action is unimaginative, complete with exhausting slow-mo pauses. Its violence is toned down and defanged, even though it’s about, y’know, vampires. In spite of direction from Daniel Espinosa, who previously made 2017’s surprisingly creepy Life, Morbius does not convey any real atmosphere. If Instagram had a “blockbuster” filter, this film would use it the whole time.  It’s also buck-wild that Morbius manages to do all this while starring Jared Leto. He’s the guy who made the Joker comically twisted, his hilariously transformative performance is the best part of House of Gucci, he’s doing extremely committed accent work in WeCrashed. This is a man who should be able to make Morbius a meme. Instead, he’s a victim, sucked dry by a big-budget movie that’s only interested in selling a sequel. "
"Apr 1, 2022",POSITIVE,"Not the best written, but Jared Leto's surprisingly restrained performance mixed with Matt Smith's scenery chewing makes this a decent enough monster movie."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," Morbius is a complete mess from start to finish. There is so much wrong with this movie that even a great performance from Matt Smith cannot save it. It breaks my heart into a million pieces to admit that I was wrong in having any hope for Morbius, but alas, I was dead wrong. This movie was somehow much worse than I anticipated, and I was going in very cautiously optimistic. Jared Leto tries, he really does, but unfortunately the newest Marvel movie from the Sonyverse is a hot mess from start to finish. The story itself is disjointed, the editing is jarring, the CGI is some of the worst I have EVER seen, and the mid-credit scene makes absolutely no sense at all. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.  In Morbius, Doctor Michael Morbius is dedicated to curing the blood disease that he has been suffering his entire life with. He gets the brilliant idea to use blood from vampire bats and things do not go according to plan. The side effects include him thirsting for blood — human blood. Lucky for him (and those around him) he created “the blue stuff” — fake human blood that fends off his urges for a little bit.  The rest of the main plot is hard to talk about without using spoilers, but let’s just say he might not be the only blood thirsty creature in town. So is he good, evil, or in the middle somewhere? The movie never really figures that out. Not completely anyways. There are many plot holes and moments that I can only describe as weird. Some bizarre choices were made when creating this movie and I can’t tell if this was always an issue, or the delays forced the team to go back and change things because of movies that were supposed to come out after it, have now come out before it. It is extremely disjointed and confusing at times. I wish I could say there is a good story in there somewhere, but there really isn’t. The plot and storyline aren’t the only issues here though. In fact, they are the easiest to swallow. The editing and CGI are so jarring, and so choppy, that it caused me to leave the theater with a massive headache. When I first saw the Morbius reveal in the trailer I was thrilled — and thought he looked amazing. That is probably the only good vampire shot in the entire movie. What you can see, because yes this movie is quite literally way too dark, is just not good.  There are flashes of the vampire faces that are laughable — like 90s Buffy the Vampire Slayer vibes but maybe even worse. When Morbius is flying through the air fighting, he just looks like swirling colors. This was a huge misfire. The bats look ridiculous at times, and quite honestly, nothing that was CGI works. Not one thing except perhaps that one shot.  It seems like Jared Leto tried really hard with this character, but it just didn’t work out. This is not his fault, as a lot of the problem is the dialogue that is surely from the script. I feel a bit bad for Leto as he really is a good actor, he has just had a bad string of roles lately. There is a lot of humor that falls flat, and just doesn’t work – this is coming from someone who quite enjoyed the silly humor of Venom and Venom: Let There Be Carnage. Matt Smith is the little bit of saving grace here, as his character is not only interesting, but entertaining. Again with the weird choices though, as there is one scene in the Subway that I cannot imagine what they had to do to get him to agree to do it. Because he looks ridiculous. I was embarrassed for him. Overall though, his character has the best arc, and most complete storyline out of them all. In the trailers there were a lot of Marvel Easter Eggs which had fans wondering which universe this movie was going to exist in. Don’t worry though, you don’t have to think too hard because they have all been pulled out of this movie, solidifying that Morbius is in the Sonyverse. Then the mid and end credit scenes come along and further confuse things because what they are trying to do is cool, but they do it all wrong. Fans already know this is not how things work, so it becomes yet another weird and bizarre decision. Morbius is disjointed, rushed, poorly edited, and then it ends abruptly with viewers just kind of staring at their screen wondering what just happened. The mid and end credit scenes certainly do not help, or even make the film worth the effort of watching. It’s sad and disappointing because there could have been a good story in there. Morbius is an interesting character from the comic books, and coupled with Blade, who we know to be hitting the MCU soon, this should have been a home run.  One of the most compelling and conflicted characters in Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters comes to the big screen as Oscar® winner Jared Leto transforms into the enigmatic antihero Michael Morbius. Dangerously ill with a rare blood disorder and determined to save others suffering his same fate, Dr. Morbius attempts a desperate gamble. While at first it seems to be a radical success, a darkness inside him is unleashed. Will good override evil – or will Morbius succumb to his mysterious new urges?

"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," So many superheroes, and yet it sometimes feels as if there are only a few. Dr Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) is a brainy scientist, like Dr Strange, and also a broody loner given to skulking on rooftops, like Batman. Every so often he transforms into his monstrous alter ego, like Venom or the Hulk – and he can fly like Superman, or at least glide short distances. Aside from his twitchy fragility and hippie-goth look – the 1990s are back, or at least Hollywood wants them to be – the thing supposed to set Morbius apart is that he’s a “living vampire”. Afflicted since childhood with a rare wasting disease, he invents a serum that restores his vitality while conferring all the benefits of being undead. The one drawback is the traditional thirst for human blood, but through trial and error he learns to keep his rampages to a minimum. His childhood pal Milo (Matt Smith) has the same disease, but a shakier moral compass, and if you’re not sure where this is going you could try asking the nearest child of 10. If there’s anything unusual about the director Daniel Espinosa’s approach, it’s that he doesn’t appear to be trying for anything in particular. There’s none of the overwrought ambition of a recent Warner Bros. blockbuster such as The Batman, nor much of the flippancy associated with Marvel. Mostly, he’s content to alternate between generic special-effects sequences and close-ups that document the actors’ honourable efforts to transcend the script. Leto works hard as usual, even if his mumbly, offbeat line readings and other odd choices don’t quite add up to a character. Smith’s more theatrical approach is better judged on the whole, though perhaps there should be a moratorium on supervillains throwing their arms out wide and twirling on the spot to express a yen for world domination. Others have less to work with: Adria Arjona’s role as Morbius’ extremely loyal colleague is a throwback to the era – not really longer ago than yesterday – when love interests were often guarantees of the hero’s heterosexuality and little more. While I’m the last person to insist that every superhero blockbuster needs to go for two-and-a-half hours, you know something has gone badly wrong when a movie comes to an abrupt halt just when you might expect it to start gearing up for the big climax. The closing credits incorporate teasers for sequels in the usual Marvel manner, which here seems more than usually optimistic. As a Sony release, Morbius does not strictly take place in the Marvel cinematic universe. But it does tie in with the larger “multiverse” explored in the recent Spider-Man: No Way Home, albeit indirectly (to explain all this properly might take a double degree in comic-book history and copyright law). Over the years, there have been plenty of mediocre movies associated with the Marvel brand, but I can’t recall one so blatantly willing to leave viewers shortchanged. For those of us wondering how much longer the age of superheroes can possibly last, it’s an interesting development."
"Apr 1, 2022",NEGATIVE," In “Morbius,” a helicopter sweeps through the foggy jungles of Costa Rica landing on a remote cliff. As the camera cranes through a murky CGI-drenched cave, you’d be hard pressed to feel the opening scene’s intended gloom. It’s no secret the desperate lengths contemporary movies, especially of the comic book variety, rely on VFX to do  a film’s emotional heavy lifting. And following  “Venom,” “Joker,” and so forth, the tired novelty of villains starring in their own sympathetic origin stories offers few surprises. So as Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto), a brooding biochemist living with a blood disease, sways with the assistance of crutches getting off the helicopter, the mystery of his story is moot. We’ve seen this movie before, in far, far better forms. Daniel Espinosa’s “Morbius,” a misbegotten, artistically bankrupt bid by writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless to fuse a gothic horror edge to the MCU, is the nadir of comic book cinema. Created by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane, the titular villain, sometimes anti-hero, sprung from the pages of “The Amazing Spider-Man” in 1971, imbuing the  webslinger’s universe with a supernatural grittiness. On its face, injecting Morbius into the sterile, all-too-clean confines of the MCU should accomplish similar aims. Espinosa, unfortunately, is so beholden to the timbre of mass entertainment, he struggles to provide his film with the necessary bloodlust, brutality and frights to rise above a snore. The Times is committed to reviewing theatrical film releases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because moviegoing carries risks during this time, we remind readers to follow health and safety guidelines as outlined by the CDC and local health officials. The scrubbing in “Morbius” starts with a flashback to  25 years earlier. A young Morbius befriends Milo, a boy similarly afflicted with a blood disease requiring three transfusions a day to live. They view themselves as two broken people defying a cruel world. It’s a cloying ableist angle, barely dealt with by the haphazard script, worsened when Dr. Nichols (a criminally unused Jared Harris), the head of the facility where they are being treated, notices Morbius’ innate gift for mechanics and sends him to a place where his talents will not be wasted. Unlike other elongated comic book movies, Espinosa’s flick, clocking in at 108 minutes, features a compact run time. Bearing in mind the sage words of critic Roger Ebert, however, “No good movie is too long and no bad movie is short enough.” Morbius falls in the latter. In the early going, for instance, the film goes to great lengths to build a romance between Morbius and the devoted Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona). She steadfastly supports the pained and pale Morbius — now a Nobel Prize winner for inventing artificial blood — by assisting in his unethical experiments. Fusing together human and bat DNA, he eventually tests his invented serum on himself, accidentally morphing into a dhampir. Empowered with super strength, he no longer needs crutches to walk. He also gains sonic hearing, can float through the air and communicate with bats. The problem: Every few hours he needs blood or he’ll revert back to his past state. We’re never wholly invested in Morbius. That shortcoming somewhat stems from Leto. The forlorn character serves as his second trip through comic book land,  after portraying the unhinged Joker in “Suicide Squad.” Contrary to that role, there’s a palpable distance here between him and the audience. Leto loves flexing uncomfortable weirdos toward uneasy and haunting ends. Unlike “Blade Runner 2049” or “The Little Things,” where he could float through scenes as a blank villain, Morbius requires pathos, a layer deeply lacking in Leto’s range. The result is a story without heart. The dearth of sympathy for Morbius could be dismissed if the film’s other components were stronger. Instead a general allergy to detail courses through every vein. The special effects are simply dreadful. Rather than relying on makeup or practical effects to achieve Morbius’ dhampir appearance, computer graphics force a comically sunken visage, exposing his cheekbones and mummifying his jawline for a dehydrated look rather than a powerful or terrifying mien. The first major action sequence, staged on a freighter sailing through international waters, sees Morbius decimate a team of mercenaries. The slow motion and jump scare editing, mixed with plumes of black smoke, aims for frights, but only manages to stitch together a smattering of incomprehensible images. The bloody incident grabs the attention of detectives Stroud (Tyrese Gibson) and Rodriguez (Al Madrigal), who come to suspect Morbius in a string of murders. While the agents are a reach for a gritty milieu, the underwritten script gives the pair nothing but boilerplate dialogue, rendering them as mere window dressing. A similar ailment befalls the scares: One fright, set in a dark hospital hallway, wherein a nurse frantically runs from an unseen predator, falls flat under generic horror tropes. For this movie to find success on any level, the relationship between Morbius and Milo (Matt Smith) requires believability. Tired of waiting for death, the latter takes Morbius’ serum, becoming a vicious murderer who needs stopping. Smith rises above the film, moving with a lanky, unencumbered energy not unlike his “Doctor Who” days. He and Leto, unfortunately, do not share any chemistry. Each is acting in a totally different movie. Their fight scenes carry little potency under director of photography Oliver Wood’s murky, teal lighting. In fact, you can barely make out their faces. As they soar through the air, trading blows as a flurry of debris flies toward the lens, it’s a challenge following the characters’ movements, much less feeling any awe. Why are action scenes, now, so difficult for Hollywood to pull off? It’s a shocking problem in “Morbius” considering editor Pietro Scalia’s past award-winning work on “Gladiator” and “Black Hawk Down.” Why is Espinosa so afraid to show blood or gore? What’s keeping him from allowing us to see human bodies move balletically around each other rather than actors diluted to grotesque wax figures plunging wildly out of sight? An over-reliance on special effects is all too common in filmmaking today. And “Morbius” might be the worst-looking of them all. This movie is also devoid of depth. It is emblematic of a system that places amusement park wonderment above sturdy storytelling. It’s no surprise how quickly two post-credit scenes setting up a sequel conclude the film. Was this a real movie or just a badly made vehicle for future franchises? The fact that the question needs answering says everything about the present state of Hollywood blockbusters and the lackluster quality of “Morbius.”"
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," “Morbius” tenía el potencial de convertirse en una aterradora historia de vampiros, criaturas de la noche, y personajes vulnerables, pero al final del día, el director Daniel Espinosa y sus equipo han decidido entregarnos algo un poco más previsible. Lo que tenemos acá es un blockbuster meramente competente, que se descarrila de manera tan alucinante durante su tercer acto —y especialmente durante sus escenas post-créditos—, que uno puede evitar sentir un mal sabor de boca al salir de la sala de cine. Puede que no sea la peor película jamás hecha, pero ciertamente podría haber sido mucho mejor. “Morbius” cuenta la historia, apropiadamente, del Doctor Michael Morbius (Jared Leto), quien desde pequeño ha sufrido de una enfermedad mal definida que afecta su sangre y su movilidad. Felizmente, tuvo la suerte de ser cuidado por Emil Nikols (Jared Harris), quien lo trató tanto a él como a su mejor amigo, Milo (Matt Smith) como si fueran sus hijos. No obstante, ya de adulto, Morbius está obsesionado con encontrar la cura para su enfermedad, tanto así que se adentra en una cueva en la selva de Costa Rica, trayendo de vuelta a un grupo de murciélagos vampíricos que podrían ayudarlo. Y eso es precisamente lo que hacen. Con la ayuda de su mejor amiga (y potencial interés amoroso), la doctora Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), Morbius logra desarrollar un suero, el cual no solo lo cura de su enfermedad (tornándolo musculoso, porque obviamente), si no que también le da poderes de vampiro, otorgándole mucha fuerza, agilidad… y desgraciadamente, una espantosa sed de sangre. Es esto último lo que no puede controlar, desgraciadamente, lo cual empeora cuando Milo se inyecta el mismo suero, y se convierte en una versión maléfica de lo que Morbius podría llegar a ser. Es así que nuestro protagonista se empecina en detener a su viejo amigo, antes de que sea demasiado tarde. Lo mejor de “Morbius”, curiosamente, está durante la primera mitad de la historia. Es cuando conocemos a Michael, adentrándonos en su infancia, viendo cómo se desarrolló su amistad con Milo, y cómo eventualmente se obsesionó con encontrar la cura de su enfermedad, que la película se siente más verosímil, más interesante. Por más de que haya sido criticado en ciertos círculos, el trabajo actoral de Leto no es malo, y maneja una química decente con Adria Arjona, quien hace lo que puede con un personaje algo plano. En todo caso, “Morbius” logra ser bastante entretenida durante los momentos de descubrimiento del personaje, cuando lo vemos probando sus poderes, y disfrutando de una libertad que nunca antes había tenido. No obstante, es cuando la película se va acercando a su inevitable clímax, que las cosas se tornan más caóticas. Ciertos eventos se sienten inconexos o hasta incoherentes, y la “batalla final” (porque siempre tiene que haber una batalla final) se siente más anticlimática que otra cosa, haciendo que Morbius demuestre poderes que antes no había aprovechado tanto, y en general, abusando de efectos visuales digitales que se sienten excesivos en comparación a todo lo que vino antes. Entiendo que quisiesen culminar la historia de manera espectacular, pero en este caso en particular, se siente como un giro forzado, y para colmo de males, visualmente confuso. Fuera de Leto y Arjona, sin embargo, vale la pena destacar a Matt Smith, quien parece estar pasándola de lo lindo como un villano que simplemente disfruta del caos a su alrededor. Resulta gracioso verlo bailar mientras se pone un terno frente al espejo, o gritarle frases trilladas a Jared Leto como si no hubiese un mañana. Lamentablemente, “Morbius” decide concentrarse, también, en una suerte de subtrama con Tyrese y Al Madrigal, quienes interpretan a una pareja de policías cuyo impacto en la narrativa es prácticamente nulo. Es en serio; podrían quitar a estos dos personajes de la película, y absolutamente nada de la trama cambiaría. El hecho de que Tyrese, además, interprete al oficial Stroud de manera seria y hasta aburrida ciertamente no ayuda. Prefiero verlo de payaso en las películas de “Rápidos y Furiosos”. Por otro lado, el trabajo de Espinosa en “Morbius” no es del todo convincente. Algunas de las secuencias de acción abusan de la cámara lenta o del shakycam, lo cual hace que la película se sienta, al menos por momentos, como un producto de hace diez o quince años. Y por alguna razón, muchas escenas abusan de los primeros planos con lentes largos, haciendo que sea difícil que uno se ubique en el espacio que los personajes comparten. “Morbius” se siente curiosamente claustrofóbica, quizás no solo debido al trabajo de Espinosa, si no también a la intervención de Sony en el proceso de post-producción. Obviamente no tengo evidencia concreta, pero “Morbius” se siente como un producto modificado por un estudio sin la (completa) intervención de sus creadores. Al final del día, sin embargo, “Morbius” no es terrible —comienza bien, se desarrolla con algo de promesa, pero concluye de manera increíblemente torpe, desperdiciando a actores de la talla de Jared Harris (súper infravalorado), Adria Arjona (quien ha destacado en series como “Good Omens”), y sí, aunque no lo crean, hasta Tyrese. Los efectos visuales son decentes, las secuencias de acción no están mal, y las interacciones entre Leto y Smith o hasta Leto y Arjona le otorgan algo de pulso a la historia, pero fuera de eso, no hay mucho más que recomendar. Hasta las escenas post-créditos son decepcionantes —incluso habiendo visto (y disfrutado de) “Spider-man: Sin camino a casa”, me resultaron incoherentes y confusas. Pero lo peor, creo, es que mucha gente terminará olvidando a “Morbius”; honestamente, dudo que vaya a causar muchas reacciones apasionadas, ya sean positivas o negativas.

"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Not good. It includes a weak story, stale performances, and jerky action and editing. Serves as a reminder of what a disappointing superherocomic film looks like. Full review in Spanish"
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," After nearly two years of pandemic-related delays, Morbius finally hits theaters on Friday, arriving on April 1 like some kind of really expensive April Fools’ joke. The film stars Jared Leto as the titular living vampire and the latest anti-hero to emerge from Sony’s Spider-Man universe with his own movie following Venom. Since this is an origin film, naturally, it begins with the traumatic childhood of young Michael Morbius, who resides in a hospital for kids suffering from a rare and incurable blood disease. He instantly becomes best friends with Milo, who’s played as an adult by Matt Smith, and they bond over their shared tribulations. Several decades later, Michael is now a doctor in New York City, where he works alongside the smart and sexy scientist Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) to find a cure for his blood disease and hopefully thereby find redemption. Dr. Morbius theorizes that vampire cells can solve his and Milo’s condition, but after an experiment goes predictably awry, he instead becomes a vampire-like creature, thirsty for blood, able to hear minuscule sounds, dodge bullets, bust through iron walls, and trapeze through the air like a bat. Considering that he is a bat, one could argue that Morbius is Marvel’s answer to DC’s Batman, but the stakes are both higher, in that Morbius is a supernatural creature, and lower, in that it’s Marvel, so bad things rarely happen to heroes. But once Milo injects himself with the same vampiric serum that gave Morbius his powers, he becomes a “bad” version of his friend and the two of them quickly become foes, facing off over and over, etc. And that’s the problem with a lot of these comic book movies — you know the protagonist is never in real danger because corporate greed overrides the potential finality of a superhero story, which subsequently often suffers from a lack of consequences as a result. That result is bad enough on its own, but when it gets imported into movies that focus on villains, excuse me, anti-heroes, it makes the story nearly unbearable. Venom, for example, is supposed to be a bad, unlikeable guy, but in Sony’s Marvel universe, he’s a funny jokester played with wink-wink malevolence by human host Tom Hardy. This Morbius, too, is a good, decent guy. When he realizes the danger behind his powers, he sets out to destroy himself. To give the film a sense of purpose, screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (vampire world veterans who wrote Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter) create Milo, the truly evil version of Morbius. That character didn’t quite exist in the comics, but he’s here so that the bad guy-turned-good can vanquish someone and there can be a real villain. This remarkable trend of removing all possible stakes from every new movie accelerated to a stunning degree when all the Spider-Man villains were rehabilitated in No Way Home, and that strategy eventually makes a ghoulish appearance in this film as well. From a technical perspective, Morbius director Daniel Espinosa does a decent enough job with this problematic script, leveraging Leto’s undeniable talent and solid below-the-line craft. Most of the credit would go to a makeup artist, who in the first third of the film makes Leto look miserably gaunt, with a disturbing pallor that contrasts well with the rejuvenated version of the character (in a sequence that is riffed straight out of Steve Rogers’ first transformation in Captain America). That is, until one realizes that even that transformation is likely just the product of Matthew Butler’s all-encompassing visual effects and that Sony does not even officially credit a single makeup artist for the film. But Butler goes too far, even for a Marvel movie, making the key action sequences impossibly disorienting and confusing — quite like a Moebius strip. Each character is surrounded by a gas-like aura, giving the sense that they’re moving faster than light or sound, but key battles are physically impossible for the human eye to follow, and even Oscar winner Pietro Scalia’s best editing tricks can fix this problem. Then again, what more can one expect from a script that is fundamentally disinterested in telling a cohesive story, that simply wants to lay down markers, explain the character to you, and get to the end credits so it can dazzle you with teasers for the next chapter in this sad, sorry saga. Meanwhile, this first film whiffs on the relationship between Michael and Milo, who are supposed to be best friends, though the contours of their relationship are poorly defined. Is Milo jealous of Michael, or is it the other way around, and if they’re so close and so similar to each other, why does Milo decide to use his powers for evil? I just wanted a little bit more character motivation, because that relationship gets lost in a blur of visual effects, and even those are ineffective. Sony — in association with Marvel — seems to be setting up The Sinister Six, which is a group of Spider-Man villains. Of course, whether these villains are actually used as such remains a question, as just like The Suicide Squad, they could easily be presented as misunderstood heroes. In any event, Morbius feels like a sacrificial lamb — a jagged piece of the puzzle Sony has been building to capitalize on the success of its Spider-Man franchise, but a piece that, nonetheless, remains puzzling."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Jared Leto stars as a sulking, skulking vampire in a bloodless and boring comics adaptation desperately riding the coat-tails of the Marvel movie powerhouse."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," Morbius is half-baked superhero fare that can’t escape the trappings of other similarly forgettable comic book adaptations. Stacked against other live-action Sony/Marvel outings, it’s unremarkable. 2018’s Venom coasted on a bizarre Tom Hardy performance and a tonal departure that was better felt than described. Its follow-up, Venom: Let There Be Carnage, was just as weird, wild, and mindless. Morbius would be lucky to have that much personality. Director Daniel Espinosa does what he can to make Morbius likeable and compelling, but the bones of a great story just aren’t there. It’s briskly paced and action-packed yet perfunctory and vapid, with isolated highs keeping it watchable. Leto turns in an earnest performance as Dr Michael Morbius, a world-renowned scientist with a rare blood disorder. After a lab accident transforms him into a vampire-adjacent creature with a monstrous appetite, he must fight to sate his bloodlust and keep the people he loves safe. We’ve seen better (Dallas Buyers Club) and worse (Suicide Squad) from Leto, but his performance here – like most of the movie – is largely mid-tier. He’s clearly committed to the performance and wants to communicate the character’s pain and loneliness. To that end, he succeeds. As stodgy and hackneyed as it often feels, Morbius does boast fleeting moments of inspiration. Matt Smith’s villainous Milo injects energy and enthusiasm into an overly serious and dull script. Smith’s comical indulgence makes him the perfect foil for Leto’s Morbius, whose intensity and self-seriousness sometimes push against the story’s more self-aware elements. From cockily swaying his hips over the corpses of freshly murdered cops to primping himself for late-night gallivanting, Smith’s supervillain is an unapologetic monster and a blast to watch. It’s a shame that nearly everything else falls apart around him."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," Morbius hits the ground running, but the Living Vampire movie is ultimately an uneven film that never quite figures out what it wants to be.  After years of delays, Morbius is finally coming to theaters and bringing the Living Vampire to the big screen. With Academy Award winner Jared Leto starring as the bloodthirsty antihero, Morbius is a rushed affair that hits all the beats of a superhero origin story as quickly as possible before giving Michael Morbius the ultimate test of confronting his very first supervillain. With a nonsensical narrative, uneven pacing, and dated special effects and storytelling sensibilities, Morbius is one of the weaker licensed superhero films in recent memory and could derail Sony's plans for their own Marvel shared universe.   For all their lives, Michael Morbius and his best friend Milo (Matt Smith) have suffered from a chronic blood disorder that left them physically weakened and facing the certainty of an early death. In order to develop a cure, Morbius dedicated his life to becoming the foremost blood expert in the world, undergoing radical experiments with vampire bats in his research. However, Morbius faces the dark price of his unorthodox gene-splicing techniques, effectively transforming into a superhuman figure with a persistent and deep hunger for human blood that puts him in a moral dilemma about his new lease on life.   Morbius hits the ground running, with the eponymous scientist and aspiring superhero already well along the way towards developing the serum that will transform him into a living vampire by the time the movie starts. This breakneck pacing continues throughout the film, with characters quickly descending into villainy or Morbius himself developing alternatives to his condition rapidly across the story. This movie wants to get through its story, leading to all manner of lapses in logic and glaring plot holes that not even an overuse of bad slow-motion in its action sequences can fix.   The big problem is that Morbius doesn't quite know what it wants to be. On the one hand, it takes direct cues from Venom as a good man is tortured by the monster that he has become before learning to use this against evil. Morbius feels much more derivative than Venom, however, with an uninspired approach. On the other hand, the movie wants to lean into vampiric horror but can only go so far within the content permitted by its PG-13 rating. Given the sheer amount of footage in its trailers but not in the final film, Morbius feels like a movie that was tampered with extensively throughout its stalled production.   Most of the cast members of Morbius aren't unwatchable, and there is a level of earnestness to their performances. Matt Smith is visibly having a blast with the opportunity to cut loose and embrace his inner villain as he plays off Leto's Morbius, with that unhinged energy giving the film a much-needed boost in its latter half. There is a talented cast and crew working on this project, which unfortunately isn't enough to save Morbius.   Morbius tries to recapture the magic of Venom and its sequel and build onto the shared cinematic universe, but the lackluster movie instead threatens to stop such ambitions dead in their tracks. There has already been much discussion about the clumsy handling of its ties to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which just highlights how confused Sony appears to be about its direction with its licensed Marvel properties. More than just uncertain of where to take its motley crew of antiheroes next, Morbius suggests that Sony doesn't know what to do with its growing line of Spider-Man spinoffs at all.  Sam Stone is a 10th level pop culture guru living just outside of Washington, DC who knows an unreasonable amount about The Beatles. You can follow him on Twitter @samstoneshow and ask him about Nintendo, pop punk, and Star Trek. Hundreds of Beavers ushers in a new era of practical effects and crude comedy with what could become the next big cult film classic from Canada. "
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," In 2004, Morbius might have been a pretty good movie. Today, the comic book spin-off, which stars Jared Leto as Spider-Man opponent Dr. Michael Morbius, feels dated and purposeless. If this were a Disney Marvel Studios property, rather than under the Sony umbrella, you’d be watching Morbius this weekend on Disney+ as part of a six-part limited series showcasing the origins of the tormented, blood-sucking villain, rather than feeling forced to pay for a big-screen experience that doesn’t necessitate a big screen.  MORBIUS 1/2 (0.5/4 stars)
Directed by: Daniel Espinosa
Written by: Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless
Starring: Jared Leto, Matt Smith, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris, Al Madrigal, Tyrese Gibson
Running time: 104 mins. Leto, who hopefully didn’t fully method act his way through this one, portrays Michael with complete humorless sincerity, which causes a ripple effect through the film’s overall somber tone. Venom, as well as its slightly less successful sequel, worked because it never took itself too seriously, offering a real sense of fun, particularly in the outlandish characterization of the title character. Not so much here. The only thing remotely whimsical about Morbius, helmed by director Daniel Espinosa, is Matt Smith’s performance as Milo, Michael’s childhood best friend.  Michael and Milo grew up together, both suffering from the same degenerative blood disease. After a youth spent in a hospital in Greece, looked after by a kindly doctor named Nicholas (a wasted Jared Harris), Michael becomes world-renowned for creating synthetic blood, which saves many lives—but not his own. So intent on finding a cure for his illness, which makes him weak and barely able to walk, Michael rejects the Nobel Prize and begins secretly running experiments using vampire bat DNA. He manages to combine his own blood with that of some bats he captured in Costa Rica and injects a serum into his spine with the help of his sort-of love interest Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona). This sense of hubris, of course, goes dramatically awry and Michael becomes a blood-thirty vampire himself, killing a bunch of people in the process.  All of this set-up is . . . fine. But once Michael transforms into Morbius, who looks a lot like those badly prosthetic-ed vampires in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, nothing is really at stake. After the universe-shattering plot of Spider-Man: No Way Home this is a pin prick. The only drama comes when Milo gets his hands on the serum and takes advantage of his new-found power with some mildly murderous intent. But the world isn’t in trouble. Even the city of New York, which has been CGI-ed together after the film shot in London, isn’t really under any kind of threat. Early on the film Michael is deeply concerned about a young patient, who presumably also suffers a blood disorder, but we never find out what happens to her. Does Morbius save anyone? Do we care? Where’s Venom to make a joke and lighten the mood?  Visually, there are some interesting moments, especially when Espinosa hints at creepy horror aesthetics, but the visual effects feel like something out of that early era of superhero movies in the mid-‘00s when the technology wasn’t quite there yet. The final showdown between Michael and Milo, where, again, nothing really appears to be at stake, is a muddled mess of CGI. Moon Knight, which premiered its first episode this week on Disney+, has better visual effects and broader scope than this and yet Sony still kept delaying the release of Morbius until it could be seen in theaters. Unless your ticket is free, don’t bother. This movie is as lifeless as the bodies Morbius drains and throws on the floor.  We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," Apparently, the days of insultingly lazy superhero movies have not yet died out. Sure, there are still misfires here and there, but they at least have a sense of creative ambition or ideas worth giving a second chance in a sequel. Morbius is the worst of these comic book adaptations since 20th Century Fox failed miserably with Fantastic Four. It has some of the ugliest special effects seen in modern blockbusters with characters that look absolutely ridiculous when letting out their inner vampire. Such transformations not only lack finesse and detail, but look and are acted so silly that it’s hard to blame someone for spending these 100 minutes hoping someone gives Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto, for once lately, the least of a film’s problems) a Snickers bar because he’s just not him when he is bloodthirsty. Good characters and storytelling can always overcome shoddy CGI, though. Unfortunately, Morbius comes across designed by a committee (it is directed by Daniel Espinosa with screenwriting credits from Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless) to establish aspects of characters without actually characterizing them. Based on a character created by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane, Morbius only seems interested in giving viewers a cliffnotes version of the hero. Without context, the film starts with the good doctor securing exotic bats from Costa Rica to bring back to New York. It’s explained that he was born with a blood disease, but that doesn’t stop the entire sequence from feeling like you walked into the middle of the story. From there, the story goes back thirty years to a children’s hospital for those with similar conditions, where Michael befriends the bullied Milo (played by Matt Smith as an adult). This is also where Michael demonstrates prodigal intelligence, repairing a malfunctioned blood transfusion device by opening up the control panel and fixing it up with a ballpoint pen. Their doctor, Emil Nikols (a wasted Jared Harris), points this out with nearly the same delivery as the infamous bad guy impressed Tony Stark built something in a cave with a box of scraps. It’s as if the filmmakers were desperate to become another quotable sensation. Hell, at one point, when Michael has become a vampire and is running low on blood satiation, he quips, “you won’t like me when I’m hungry,” like he is a variation on The Incredible Hulk. It’s certainly not a funny joke and just feels like the writers couldn’t be bothered to write the character. Anyway, Michael gets a full education ride and becomes the successful doctor he is introduced as, dedicating his life to curing such blood diseases. He also remains friends with Milo, seemingly unbreakable as they compare their resiliency and strength to the Spartans (they are the few against the many). Lest you think the filmmakers might go somewhere with that analogy, they don’t. It’s not long before Michael’s experiments irreversibly change him in unexpected ways, killing and drinking the blood of an entire security team. Following coming to his senses through artificial blood, he vows to make sure this never happens again while testing out various changes to his body. At the same time, his medical assistant Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) looks on in horror and is then roped into a generic romantic subplot. Shortly after that (and contrived like nearly every aspect of this plot), Milo realizes that Michael has concocted a working serum from bats and doesn’t hesitate for a second to take it behind his back, knowing full well what unstoppable cravings the cure provides. The desire for blood is so impossible to resist with artificial blood running out, Michael might have to do the unthinkable just to make sure he doesn’t hurt anyone again, but not before stopping Milo. Cue several action sequences that feel inspired by a terrible early 2000s video game adaptation of a comic book movie (one of Michael’s abilities is echolocation, which is realized visually like a player is pressing down the right thumbstick and scanning the area, but with bland effects). There are as many slow-motion triggers as a Zack Snyder movie, but not exhilarating to watch. The final battle ends as fast as it begins, although that might be a blessing in disguise, considering the betrayal and rivalry buildup between Michael and Mil is forced. Morbius also has a hugely problematic element with its poorly defined motivations for a disabled villain. Yes, it is sensible that Milo wants others to know what his sickness and emotional pain felt like, but it’s dialed up to 11 here with chaotic evil unconcerned with the villain’s humanity. The potential for a strong throughline with Morbius exists if it were to focus on these disabled characters with a shred of respect and care beyond “one is a superhero, one is a villain.” Matt Smith attempts to give Milo a flamboyant, indulgent persona, but it amounts to nothing since the writing is paper-thin. Meanwhile, Jared Leto is somehow missing the charisma and spark to play a human/vampire hybrid capable of superhuman feats. One of the only kind things there is to say about Morbius is that due to its rushed pacing and insistence on hitting plot points by the minute, it’s never necessarily boring, and it does quickly move from one set piece to the next. The initial vampiric transformation and attack are also somewhat entertaining to watch. Regardless, the film itself appears to be dying of a blood disease from its opening scene. Perhaps if one takes a serum, they will crave better movies."
"Mar 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"  The evolution of the comic book movie era has seen characters once thought to be fringe move to the mainstream. Few could have predicted that the Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man, and Shazam would someday be headlining their own movies, but here we are. Now joining the unexpected list is Morbius, aka the Living Vampire.  Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) is a brilliant scientist who has spent his entire life trying to find a cure to a disease that forces him to use canes and has left his body gaunt. His big innovation, artificial blood, has earned him international acclaim, but not the treatment that he desires. Next on his list is to splice human DNA with vampire bat DNA to create a curative serum, a risky if not insane idea.  Naturally, he experiments on himself in the first human trial, but instead of merely healing him, it turns him into a being that needs fresh blood in order to thrive and survive. Michael is horrified at what he has done to himself, but his childhood friend Milo (Matt Smith) — who suffers from a similar ailment — has no such qualms about the violent side effects of the serum.  Directed by Daniel Espinosa and written by Matt Sazama and Buck Sharpless, the film is another long-delayed effort that was mostly shot prior to the pandemic. The character, which has a history in the Spider-Man universe, initially seems to be a hard sell, given that Dr. Morbius is pretty prickly. And even though his transformation into a blood-sucking creature is dreadful to witness, it actually serves to make him a fully-realized person.  The effects the filmmakers use to show how Morbius is adapting to his newfound powers are dynamic and — rare for a movie as CGI-dependent as this — coherent. Pulsating waves, shimmering streaks, and more are employed to give the audience a feel for what Morbius is experiencing, and they continue to work throughout the film, never becoming redundant.  As for the storyline … well, at least it’s never dull. The antagonism that grows between Morbius and Milo is initially interesting, although it gets less so the more each becomes entrenched in their respective viewpoints. A semi-romance between Morbius and his co-worker, Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) sparks a bit, but it’s kind of hard to get past the inherent disconnect between a vampire and a human.  Leto, like fellow actor Tom Hardy, seems to delight in hiding or altering his normal face, which he does for most of this film. Oddly, though, for an objectively odd character in both human and vampire form, Leto puts on a better performance as Morbius than he did while dialing it up in House of Gucci. Smith complements him well, but he’s the one who goes over-the-top in this film. Arjona’s character never truly connects, but Jared Harris is effective in a mentor-type role.  Given that Morbius is supposed to be an antihero with possibly some redeeming qualities, it’ll be interesting to see how he’s positioned in the Spider-Man universe going forward. An appearance by a previous Spider-Man villain in a stinger scene during the end credits seems to point definitively in one direction, but that might also make it difficult to make a Morbius 2, as is the practice these days.  For now, Morbius is a good-enough introduction for a character who most viewers may not know well. It’s not spectacular entertainment like the Spider-Man movies, but neither will it have viewers wishing for their money back. 1.

"Mar 31, 2022",POSITIVE," Jared Leto bares his teeth as a neo-vampire who walks by day and tries to keep his monstrous thirst at bay in the latest Marvel adaptation. My, what sharp teeth he has — and what lovely skin, too. One of the revelations of “Morbius” — the latest movie to take a marginal Marvel character out of mothballs for his blockbuster close-up — is that regular blood smoothies do wonders for the skin. To judge by the chiseled planes of Morbius’s arms and torso, pounding shots of the slurpy stuff also builds muscles much faster than mainlining anabolic steroids can. Still, the bigger surprise about “Morbius” is that it doesn’t suck, at least as a movie. Against the odds and despite the insufferable persona that its star Jared Leto has cultivated, it provides all you want from a diversion about a brilliant scientist with bottomless financial resources (as well as a hot but smart assistant) who, after refusing his Nobel for his genius scientific invention, secretly develops a serum that turn him into a batlike creature with razor nails, great powers and a hunger for human blood. It also runs under two hours, i.e., a full hour less than that recent slugfest “The Batman.” I mean, what’s not to like? As usual, it opens with some temporal scrambling in the present-day Costa Rica, where the adult Morbius (Leto) swoops in on a helicopter, a darkly romantic vision with a curtain of jet-black hair, billowing clothes and hired guns. There, he embarks on a close encounter with vampire bats, as one does when swimming with dolphins has become too pedestrian. Slicing open his palm, he draws first blood and is inundated by a cloud of bats. After a leisurely flashback to his sad childhood, Morbius is back in his New York lab, experimenting and knitting brows alongside a colleague, Monica (Adria Arjona). Like “The Batman,” “Morbius” is a classic American tale of personal trauma, existential agony, regenerative violence … and bats. Once again, the trauma reaches to childhood, though in this case it involves the young Michael Morbius being treated in a Greek children’s hospital for a rare blood disease. (Why Greece? I have no idea.) There he had a sympathetic doctor (Jared Harris) and befriends a boy he calls Milo, who has the same disease. Milo grows up to become a louche moneybags played by Matt Smith, who’s best known for playing Prince Philip in “The Crown,” a bit of casting history that gives his role here amusing tang. The movie’s first half is better shaped than its second, and there are narrative lacunae here and there that suggest some late-breaking editing busywork. Even so, as a neo-vampiric tale of dread and desire, the entire thing more or less makes sense on its own improbable terms. The characters are similarly coherent, not just sketches that are designated to be filled out in successive franchise chapters. This modulation also extends to the visuals, despite the overall Goth gloom; here, lights are actually turned on and sometimes the sun even shines, if only to explain that Morbius isn’t your granny’s Dracula.

"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," If you’re going into MORBIUS for a comic book adaptation, you’ll be disappointed. MORBIUS plays like just another vampire movie rather than an origins Marvel story. With a predictable plot, inconsistent beats, flat dialogue and lingering characters with no purpose, MORBIUS is a huge letdown. The end credits feel like an afterthought that leaves you questioning your own sanity. Suffering from a rare blood disorder, Dr. Michael Morbius is determined to discover a cure to save others like himself. He gambles on a theory that turns him into a blood-sucking monster. The screenplay by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless is a generic vampire story. Man becomes infected by a bat that turns him into a vampire but he must resist the monstrous urges to kill to feed. Created for the comics by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane, it’s hard to believe the filmmakers were unable to create something a little more original rather than just take the story beats from the comics. There’s zero creativity in the cinematic introduction of Marvel’s anti-hero. First off, the cast is so bland you really don’t have anyone to root for. Leto doesn’t really bring much to the table given the unoriginal story. The rock star vampire look is sexy at least. Arjona’s Dr. Martine Bancroft does stand out as the challenger to Morbius’ choices. Matt Smith, as usual, delivers his wicked sense of humor as the cocky best friend but you can easily predict where that relationship is going. However, the rest of the cast is wasted. Jared Harris’ Dr. Emil Nikols is likable enough but he has a few scenes. Tyrese Gibson is a walking corpse with zero personality as one of the detectives on the case. Al Madrigal, as his partner, provides some comic relief, but these detectives pop in and out of scenes with no real purpose. There’s no cat and mouse game between the detectives and Morbius. I have a feeling those scenes were left on the cutting room floor. The CGI for the vampire transformation is impressive, and terrifying to look at. There was no prosthetic make-up, according to Adria, so the transformations do look authentic. However the flying scenes not so much. The CGI there looks like a graphic in a video game, hence not as believable. There are so many inconsistencies throughout the movie. The top-secret lab is a few steps away from Morbius’ patient hospital rooms. Why would an unsanctioned science lab not be isolated far from any prying eyes? It seems also that anyone can walk into this top-secret lair and steal the magic potion. The post-credit scenes promoting a future team-up are sloppy and confusing. The introduction of a familiar character throws you off and you have to process and rationalize what you just saw on screen. There is no setup or hint as to where this story exists within the Marvel universe prior to these end credits so it’s all confusing. Coming off the success of SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME, MORBIUS is a hard pill to swallow. Sony Pictures has not learned from Kevin Feige and Marvel Studios how to create a throughline among their Marvel properties. MORBIUS plays like a vampire movie, and there are those who may enjoy that storyline but comic book fans will leave the theater feeling unsatisfied."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I know that the fans will spend their time and money to see the latest Spidey-verse version entry and more power to them. But, for everyone else without that fandom fervor, why bother?"
"Mar 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"Significantly better than Venom but still somewhat lacking in bite, this origin story perhaps inevitably grows more pallid toward the end but until then proves just tasty enough to merit the giving it a shot."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," There's a scene in ""Morbius"" where Jared Leto's character, a vampire scientist named Dr. Michael Morbius — a name which sounds funnier the more every character on screen says it — stands in front of a chamber full of bats while the film's Hans Zimmer-like score swells to a crescendo. It stands out because it at least recalls something, where most of ""Morbius"" is flat, forgettable and undefined. This is comic book filmmaking at its most uninspired, as if the last 20 years of Marvel and DC movies never happened. It's enough to make you appreciate the ""Venom"" films, because as loud and messy as they are, they at least have their quirks. In ""Morbius,"" every ounce of character and personality has been sucked dry.  Leto's Morbius suffers from a rare and debilitating blood disease, and he gets around with the help of a pair of forearm crutches. His ailment leads him to find his own cure for what's missing from his DNA, and he comes up with it in the form of an artificial blood supplement (and wins a Nobel Prize in the process). When he doubles down and turns to a flock of vampire bats to extract their blood properties, well, when's the last time an experiment with vampirism went right? Morbius comes to rely on drinking blood, and he sucks down his packs of blue goo like a kid crushing a juice box after soccer practice. Soon the synthetic stuff just isn't doing it anymore, and he needs real blood to quench his increasing thirst. The conflict comes from his character not willing to give into his urges, and the blood trail that comes from the times he does. Morbius' childhood pal, Milo (Matt Smith), who suffers from the same disease, has much less resignation about draining victims of their blood, and becomes an over-the-top supervillain in the process. A pair of FBI agents, played by Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal, are always cold on the trail, and seem to be unsure of what kind of movie they're in.  The audience can sympathize. ""Morbius"" is oddly flavorless, with little narrative drive propelling it forward. It suffers from dull pacing, lifeless characters and bland action, its only visual signature coming from the whooshes Morbius and Milo leave behind when they enact their superspeed abilities. They're like colorful curls of vampire chemtrails.  As a character, Morbius is part of the Spider-Man universe, and only at the end of the movie do we get that connective tissue. That eventual tease is ""Morbius'"" raison d'etre, which somehow manages to cheapen the experience even further. The urge to expand ""Spider-Man"" is understandable, especially at the corporate level, given the massive popularity of the Spidey films. But there's nothing in ""Morbius"" that couldn't have been better summed up in a two-minute trailer. "
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," Dr. Michael Morbius suffers from a rare blood disorder that threatens to end his life before he’s had a chance to live it. He pledges the remainder of his time to find a cure, believing it’s just around the corner. Unethically tampering with the laws of science and nature, he develops a serum that brings back his vitality but at a horrible cost. Injecting himself with Costa Rican vampire bat DNA (sure), he has enhanced strength, echolocation, and regenerative abilities, yet he also craves human blood in ever-increasing cycles. On the run for crimes he believes he cannot keep himself from committing, Michael races to find a cure for his cure. With his friend and colleague, Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) they look for ways to temper his hunger and stop a looming threat in his fatalist friend, Milo (Matt Smith). At an efficient 105 minutes, Morbius doesn’t waste time with a lot of exposition or backstory. In this version of Morbius he is more anti-hero than villain, a trend Sony has chosen to embrace (see: Venom) for reasons that may become clearer as the Sony Spider-Man and Marvel Cinematic Universes converge in the future. Morbius is stylish in its color choices for the wisps of supernatural energy that trail behind him, a la Nightcrawler: black for the base creature, red for the internal rage, blue for the artificial blood that keeps him stable, and finally purple as he embraces all sides of his personality. Morbius feels tragically gothic, penned by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless. Wealthy men, brought up from shaky beginnings, inadvertently bring unspeakable horror to the masses, then race to undo the damage. Milo and Michael share a connection in their disability and pain, vowing to stick together through whatever life throws at them. While Michael becomes a renowned doctor, treating rare disorders and getting in touch with his mortality, Milo whittles away his remaining years in active, if posh, decline, angry at the able-bodied people who both torture and ignore him. Michael’s breakthroughs and inventions will help everyone, and Milo can’t wait to destroy them all. What starts as an Us vs Them battle, becomes an Us tug-of-war, with Them in the middle. I’m not gonna lie, it’s difficult to watch the Joker and the Eleventh Doctor battle it out on-screen with teeth and claws, but Morbius manages to work. Matt Smith slides effortlessly into Milo (I know, phrasing), at first helpless and vulnerable, then embodying that patient but boiling rage glimpsed early on in the prologue. Jared Harris is the blindly compassionate mentor that wants to see his charges happy, no matter their outcome. Despite not delving deeply into the whys and what-fors, Morbius focuses on the inner conflict of the main characters, showing the nuanced humanity that frays and cracks under pressure. From the characters branches the action, creating that important connection that makes it more than just another superhero movie. Its frenetic pace may not make it a must-own in any medium, but it’s a more than passable popcorn flick. It’s not a movie everyone will love, but I can think of worse movies to watch that don’t look nearly as good. Morbius is, at its core, a comic book movie, deciding very early on that it doesn’t care about realism or accuracy, and that’s fine because it embraces that ethos throughout. This is an unapologetic movie about super-powered humans, and to the devil with your logic. There will be amazing acrobatics, complicated flight, punching, and of course blood. You can’t have a super-anti-hero vampire without blood. It’s both a stand-alone film and as per the two mid-credit sequences, also integrated into the Greater Universe, so don’t dismiss it just yet. Morbius (2022) is rated PG-13 for swears, rather violent transformations, lots of blood-guzzling (both synthetic and human), sharp teeth and claws, eviscerations, drops from great heights, and bats. Please be advised there are a lot of strobe effects in this very loud movie that could trigger episodes in those who are sensitive to such things."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE,You can only imagine the carnage that must have taken place in the edit suite.
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," When I first got into film criticism, I accepted that every so often I would have to watch bad movies. This is fine for the most part – so the old adage goes, they can’t all be winners, and often there’s some perverse pleasure to be drawn from settling down in the dark to witness something that transcends taste and decency to enter what I like to call ‘fun bad’ territory. At the very least watching a truly awful film can make me feel grateful for the embarrassment of riches cinema can otherwise offer us. But every so often, I sit down and watch a film so artless, so lacking in craft or guile, I feel legitimately irritated that “burning the negative” isn’t possible since the advent of digital recording. Morbius, the Living Vampire, aka Dr Michael Morbius, PhD, MD, started out life as a Spider-Man villain, but eventually earned his own spin-off comics. Born with a rare blood disease, he turns his preternatural intelligence into a career as a world-renowned haematologist while attempting to cure his own increasingly debilitating disorder. When we meet him in this film, Morbius has just been awarded the Nobel Prize – in the first of many baffling narrative choices, the film cuts away from Michael’s acceptance speech to a newspaper some days later, telling us he rejected his Prize with a very funny speech. Right then. You see, Morbius doesn’t care about prizes. He’s fixated on finding a cure for the illness which afflicts him and his purported best friend Milo (whose name isn’t actually Milo, it’s Lucien, but Morbius couldn’t be bothered to learn it when they were in a Greek convalescence hospital, so now everyone just calls him Milo). Milo, played by Matt Smith, is a rakish socialite who bankrolls Morbius while receiving treatment from their doctor turned surrogate father, Nicholas (Jared Harris, who looks about as happy to be there as I was to see him mixed up in all this). In an ethically questionable move, Morbius decides to splice together bat and human DNA in order to create a cure for his blood disease, and when the treatment appears to work on a lab mouse, he decides to use himself as a human test subject. This results in a horrific transformation aboard a cargo ship in international waters which leaves a pile of bodies behind and Morbius on the run. Despite the characterisation of Morbius as a Living Vampire, his taxonomy seems to more closely resemble Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Initially he has no control over his ‘vampire’ persona and goes into a state of frenzy when hungry (though apparently knows not to chow down on his love interest Dr Martina Bancroft, played by Adria Arjona) but seems to become more able to control himself over the course of the film. No reason is given as to why. In fact, for a genre so concerned with world-building and lore, there’s precious little at play in Morbius; we have no grasp of his powers or weaknesses, beyond that he needs to drink artificial blood every four hours and twenty minutes, a point repeatedly brought up as if repeating it makes it more compelling. The conflict in the film comes when Milo decides he quite fancies the trade-off between curing his painful illness and becoming a creature of the night. Morbius has to stop him, for reasons that are never fully explained. While Smith cuts about like a cut-price Lestat, Leto is absolutely lost, seemingly confounded by a role which doesn’t allow him to hide behind layers of prosthetics and put on a funny little voice in place of acting. His line readings are stiff, his characterisation rote, and we have no reason to care whether he succeeds in staking his brother or not. Even the central romance has all the passion and spark of a wet weekend in Whitby. All this to say: is this it? Is this what passes for a $75 million movie in 2022? Special effects and monster design that would have barely been passable in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a plot so thinly-sketched it’s hardly there at all, and uniformly unconvincing performances that make you wonder whether or not taking part in this film was some sort of court-mandated community service? I’d like to say audiences deserve better, but maybe they don’t. Maybe the condensation of big-budget filmmaking into a few studios and over-reliance on pre-existing IP and franchising opportunities was always going to lead us to this point, where a film so utterly devoid of charisma or personality can squeak into cinemas without a second thought, all in service of building some sort of naff villain team up movie (if Morbius’ two half-hearted mid-credits scenes are anything to go by). Still, I have to hope that sooner or later the bubble will burst, and a film as insulting to audience appetites and intelligence as this will be some sort of larger lesson for Hollywood. Probably not though. There’s always another D-tier comic book character waiting in the wings for their spin-off moment.

"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," Much like splicing human and vampire bat DNA, fusing a Marvel-associated movie and a horror film has intriguing possibilities. Though odds are it won’t take. Morbius is a part of the Spider-Man Sony/Marvel universe. And like Venom before him, the character has variously been a Spidey villain, a hero and an anti-hero. Dr. Michael Morbius, played here by Jared Leto, is a mad scientist of the My-God-what-have-I-done variety. He’s cursed by a genetic and chronic blood disease, and driven to find a cure – not just for himself, but for his similarly afflicted lifelong best friend Milo (Matt Smith). His approach is described above. Unfortunately, the anti-coagulant properties the good doctor seeks are not all that humans end up sharing with vampire bats. (The film’s most egregious missed opportunity is the white lab rat that ends up being cured by the bat serum. I’m sorry to report, we do not get to see what a vampire-rat looks like). But you do get the sense that Swedish director Daniel Espinosa really wanted to make a horror film instead of the usual super-hero origin-story-punctuated-by-carnage. Owing to the illegal and unethical aspects of his work, Dr. Morbius and his colleague/love-interest Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) carry out their human test on a cargo ship in international waters. If you know your Dracula, you know this is an homage and you can pretty much figure out how that little cruise ends. In fact, for all the usual super-hero sturm und drang to which Morbius eventually succumbs, its best moments are claustrophobic. Example: a “hunt” in a dark hospital hallway that is certifiablly chilling, with lights off-and-on and the predator variously appearing from floor to ceiling to wall. Mainly set in New York, Morbius’s protagonist is a good guy to the extent that he feels really bad about the body count and seeks to undo what he’s done (Tyrese Gibson and AAl Madrigal are likeable NYPD detectives who seem to take all the exsanguinated bodies in surprising stride).  Even when not in vamp mode, both Leto and Smith (whose character wants in on the cure-my-disease action) have abs, pec and guns-for-arms they can’t help but want to show off. A lot of weight-training went into this movie. And of course, these powers are in play in the last act, which in the Sony/Marvel version of a three-act narrative is where the big, noisy battle royal takes place, with property damage to match. I suppose a vampire movie built on mood was never in the cards. As hinted in the inevitable mid-credits scene, Morbius has a future in the Spider-Man Universe, and will be interacting with other characters. And in this universe, even vampires have to go big or go home."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," Synopsis: After taking an experimental serum derived from bat DNA in an attempt to cure his debilitating disease, Dr. Michael Morbius becomes imbued with superhuman abilities but also an ever-increasing thirst for blood. When Sony decided to start exploiting their rights to Spider-Man by making movies about his supporting cast, it feels like they didn’t really know where else to go with it after Venom. I mean, we’re apparently getting movies about Kraven the Hunter and Madame Web next, with projects featuring Black Cat, Silver Sable, Silk, and Jackpot (no joke, I’m serious, bloody Jackpot!) in various stages of development too. Of all of Spidey’s associates though, it’s baffling yet fitting that their next choice after Venom was Morbius the Living Vampire, probably the only other character in that roster who has enough history away from the wall crawler to stand on his own. The final product unfortunately, after a long string of delays from its original July 2020 release date, is a dull, formulaic and overproduced nothingburger of a movie with some of the worst universe building since 2017’s The Mummy. Right from its opening moments, Morbius follows in the footsteps of the first Venom by feeling like a superhero movie made roughly twenty years ago, constantly in a battle with itself over tone and genre. Its premise is a basic sci-fi horror yarn ripped straight from the Jekyll & Hyde playbook and plays out with no real surprises, treating its plot less as an opportunity to explore its characters or world and more like a shopping checklist of tropes from superhero and vampire flicks. There’s no real nuance and depth to any of its storytelling choices, and despite trying to present Morbius as a conflicted anti-hero, the morality of the film is incredibly black-and-white and negates the internal conflict that makes the character intriguing in the first place.  The structure and pacing is all over the place, exhibiting the telltale signs of a troubled production like important plot beats happening off-screen and copius scenes from the trailers missing in the final product. Despite running at a light but healthy 104 minutes, there’s little meat on the bone here that isn’t recycled from a plethora of better films, and its teneous connections to the Marvel universe are mostly fleeting…until the inevitable post-credits bonus. Without a doubt, these two scenes are the most random, underwhelming, confusing and desperate examples of expanding a cinematic universe since…ever, to be honest. The fact they spoiled this reveal in the very first trailer (which has clearly been dropped and reshot since) is evidence enough that Sony knew they had a non-starter on their hands and just gave up, but these scenes would have fallen flat even if they had remained a secret until release. It’s hard to think of an actor more unpopular and unsuited to being the lead of an aspiring blockbuster franchise than Jared Leto, especially given his last stint as a comic book character didn’t go over so well. It’s also surprising he took the role because, as a method actor known for his bold and bonkers choices, the character of Morbius on paper doesn’t give him much to play with. Seperated from his disability, he’s seemingly a smart and sweet but boring guy, and whilst his early flippancy with scientific ethics makes it seem like he’s going to be this morally complex character, that angle is abruptly dropped once he gains his powers. After just one scene of giving into his vampiric thirst, Morbius is chugging artificial plasma and basically in control of his bloodlust for the rest of the movie, robbing the film of the horror and suspense a good man-or-monster movie craves. In their attempts to make Morbius likable, they’ve way overstepped the mark and turned him into a high-and-mighty, hypocritical, melodramatic bore. I thought it wasn’t possible to make a vampire movie this dull, but accomplishing that dubious feat is the only original thing Morbius succeeds in. The supporting cast unfortunately doesn’t fair much better. Adria Arjona does a fine enough job bringing fellow scientist and love interest Martine Bancroft to life, but she’s something of an empty vessel with no real sense of her own life outside of her relationship to Morbius. The only time she even comes close to seeming well-rounded is when she’s on good enough terms with a bodega clerk to convince him to thrown an FBI agent off her scent, but that’s really stretching. Speaking of the FBI, Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal plays said agents hunting down Morbius but they add next to nothing, especially because we know early on that Morbius is mostly innocent. At least Madrigal has some sense of character with his vampire supersitions and Alan Alda-like voice, because Gibson’s Simon Stroud is a complete empty shell role. Given that he signed a three-picture deal and said in a 2020 interview that his character was a superhero with a high-tech arm, those reshoots must have been incredibly drastic.  Similarly wasted on this film is Jared Harris as Morbius’ mentor and father figure Emil Nikols, who appears so sporadically that you forget he was even in the movie every time he shows back up. The only actor who seems to be having any fun here is Matt Smith as the friend-turned-villain Milo. Yes, the character is a pretty generic “evil mirror of the hero with the same powers” adversary (and the only other trope they’ve ripped from modern Marvel fare), but Smith’s indulgent performance is so wonderfully daft that you just wish he was the one playing Morbius instead of Leto. To put it simply, and with pun fully intended, he properly vamps it up. The reported budget of Morbius may be $75 million, but most of the time it looks like it cost about half that. The visual effects are firmly stuck in the late 2000s, with horirble scene compositing and laughable vampiric face warping on Leto and Smith ripped right out of a Video Copilot tutorial. Much of the action looks like a pre-rendered cutscene from a PS3 game, especially the scenes where Morbius flies across the city in a manner eerily similar to Alex Mercer from Prototype, and that’s when you can even tell what’s going on. The lighting is so minimal and the camera whips around so much, combined with the overuse of fog and neon, that you can only tell what’s actually happening when the action slows down in faux-Zack Snyder style. Heck, the entire climax is essentially rendered unwatchable by a gigantic swarm of bats obscuring the fight! On the plus side though…um…Jon Ekstrand’s score is decently eerie, I guess, and…I liked the look of the credits. I mean, the whole vaporwave aesthetic seems like an odd choice for a vampire superhero movie, but…nice job, whoever put together the credits? I think? The anti-hype was right for once, folks: Morbius is exactly the big-budget misguided flop everybody’s been predicting it would be. With the exception of Matt Smith’s performance, which mostly seems like him just having a bit of a laugh for an easy paycheck, there isn’t a single positive thing to say about this film that isn’t grasping at straws or doesn’t come with huge caveats. It doesn’t even have the so-bad-it’s-good qualities that made Venom morbidly enjoyable, quickly placing it amongst the worst recent examples of the genre alongside X-Men: Dark Phoenix and 2015’s Fantastic Four. What exactly Sony thinks they’re accomplishing with these Spidey-less spin-offs other than playing keep away with Marvel Studios is beyond me, because all they’ll end up doing is devaluing the brand. Yes, Sony just made a boatload off the back of No Way Home, but it would only take a few more duds like Morbius to bomb the Sonyverse and send Ol’ Webhead into the hands of Uncle Walt."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," Sorry, couldn’t help it. I don’t know if it was the absence of Marvel MCU mastermind Kevin Feige (this movie comes from Sony, which has the rights to Spider-Man and the characters from his comics) or if they’re just digging down so deep into the MCU to find new IP, I mean new characters to develop and have run out of all the good ones, or both. But whatever the reason, “Morbius,” with Jared Leto is something no superhero movie should ever be — dull. The action scenes are poorly staged and the special effects are awful. Plus, it spends much too much time on the origin story somehow without ever making us connect to the title character. Leto plays Michael Morbius, an only-in-comics character who is severely disabled and a genius. And, of course, something of a renegade. He is so dazzlingly brilliant that he is the youngest scientist ever to win a Nobel Prize, but such a rapscallion that he waits until he is wearing white tie at the ceremony to tell the King of Sweden he is turning it down. He is in a furious race against time to find a cure for his debilitating genetic disorder. The funding for his rogue lab comes from the childhood friend played as an adult by Matt Smith (“Dr. Who,” “The Crown”). They met in a residential treatment facility run by kind-hearted doctor Emil Nikols (Jared Harris). When they first meet, young Michael dubs the new arrival Milo, though his name is Lucien, to indicate that he is just another in an endless line of young patients who die so quickly it is not worth learning their names. Nevertheless, they become friends and he continues to be known as Milo. Their shared problem is some blood-related thing, so Morbius comes up with the idea that one way to cure it could be to combine his DNA with the DNA of the only animal that lives solely on blood, the vampire bat. What could go wrong? This experiment is unethical, illegal, and extremely expensive. So, with Milo footing the bill, Morbius and his beautiful colleague Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) try the DNA mixture out on a cargo ship in international waters. Think of it as his version of a radioactive spider bite except that (1) he does it on purpose and (2) vampire bats have qualities that are generally considered to be problematic, starting with an unquenchable thirst for blood. So Morbius is an anti-hero, which means we have to have an all-out bad guy so he will be not so bad by comparison. The film expects us, like the FBI agents played by woefully underused Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal that the first few murders did not matter because the people killed were not good guys, and it is only when a nice single mom gets all of the blood sucked out of her that we should care about who did it. Michael feels bad about what he did and is a scientist and wants to stop even worse things from happening, so we’re supposed to be on his side. The scientific discovery he should be focusing on is how much crime a white guy in a hoodie can get away with. Even those who come to superhero movies just for the fights and special effects will be disappointed. The CGI is primarily used to make the faces of the two vampires go back and forth from skeletal to normal, plus some meaningless dust trails that their superpowers somehow manifest. Many scenes have drab lighting that for want of a less vampiric word, sucks the life out of the story. Matt Smith is a brief bright spot but Leto spends most of his time trying to look soulful. He says that despite the poor reviews, he’s committed to a sequel. Please, no MORE-bious.  Parents should know that this film has extended comic-book style peril and violence, including vampires, with some graphic and disturbing images. Characters use mind- and body-altering medication and strong language."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," Roughly 95 million comic book movies come out every year, and they obviously can’t all be good. Intellectual property holders make them all, from the best to the worst, as a means of making money, furthering the brand. Occasionally you get some that transcend the mere commerce of it all. Recently we’ve had stuff like  The Batman,  The Suicide Squad, and  Spider-Man: No Way Home, which are all very different, with different artistic goals, but all succeeded far more than they had any right to. And then there’s Morbius, a perfunctory, sloppy, paint-by-numbers attempt to remind audiences that  Sony has the rights to these Spider-Man villains and by golly they’re going to use them. We had a bet in the Nerdist offices about whether Morbius even existed given how long ago it finished shooting. Recent interviews with director Daniel Espinosa  indicated Avengers: Endgame hadn’t even come out when they were shooting, and that feels like a lifetime ago. At any rate, the movie does exist and is here for people to see. And that’s about it. It’s not particularly good, but it’s also not so incompetent as to elicit laughter, nor so baffling as to produce consternation. The movie doesn’t make any sense, don’t get me wrong, but it’s the kind of nonsense that we’ve seen before, so nothing really stands out that much. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) has suffered from a debilitating blood disease for his entire life. Apparently his condition requires so many treatments so often that as a child he has to live in a special hospital in Greece run by a kindly physician (an absolutely wasted Jared Harris). Early on, another young boy with the same affliction moves in to the bed right next to Michael. His name is Lucien, but Michael calls him Milo. Cut to 25 years into the future and Morbius is a famed biochemist who has spent his entire life attempting to cure his and Milo’s illness. Grown up Milo (Matt Smith) is very wealthy for reasons and has bankrolled Morbius’ work. Eventually Morbius and his colleague-slash-love-interest Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) hit the jackpot through a strange source. They create a serum using vampire bat DNA. Morbius injects himself and very quickly he gets better. Well “better” is a relative term, of course. He also has an inexplicable reaction which bestows upon him several incongruous bat powers. He’s super strong and agile, natch. His hearing becomes a kind of (his words) “bat radar,” even though the word sonar has existed for a long time. His appearance changes instantly and then goes back to normal depending on the last part… he needs to inject blood to stay alive. Ruh roh. And that’s kind of the movie. Morbius becomes a monster but doesn’t want to be one; Milo becomes and monster and loves it. CGI versions of them jump around with CGI vampire faces creating some kind of CGI smoke (?) for some reason. The dialogue and characterizations are absolutely inert while the action scenes are little more than digital noise. Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal show up as federal agents (or detectives, the movie seems confused) who ostensibly investigate the rampant vampire murders, but whatevs, man. The lone bright spot in the otherwise turgid excuse for a movie is Matt Smith who actually gives a performance. He seems to relish his time as the villainous vamp so very much. A scene halfway through finds Smith dancing around his penthouse, admiring his new physique and powers and it is nothing short of delightful. He’s too good of an actor not to give it his all, but next to the plank of wood that is Leto, he’s a beacon of excellence.  The whole movie should have been about him. Morbius is just not good. There’s no two ways about it. It just feels lazy and unfinished. Milo has no last name; we never know what kind of disease he and Morbius have; they can’t seem to agree on what Morbius’ vampire face should look like from scene to scene. I didn’t like the first Venom movie but at least it felt like someone made it; Morbius feels like a movie that was willed into existence by the incepted dreams of Columbia Pictures execs.

"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," A dark adventure that gets darker as it goes, Morbius flexes its action muscles early and often, telling the story of a brilliant doctor who is desperately searching for a cure to a rare, blood-borne disease. His latest experiment goes disastrously wrong, turning him into a ‘living vampire’ with an insatiable appetite for human blood.  Scripted by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, a writing team whose credits include Lost in Space, Gods of Egypt and Dracula Untold, based on a Marvel comic-book character, created by Roy Thomas, that first appeared in 1971, Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) is presented as someone whose life was shaped by a rare, disabling medical condition. In his youth, he met Milo (Matt Smith), who suffered from the same disease, but came from a far more privileged background. The two became lifelong friends, and Milo continues to fund Mobius’ medical experiments.  Lately, Dr. Morbius has been focusing his research on vampire bats, and believes he may have found a cure. He is seriously mistaken, resulting in a disturbing collection of corpses that have all been drained of their blood, save for a sole survivor, Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), Morbius’ colleague and a romantic interest.  As soon as Milo learns of the Morbius solution, and sees for himself that the ‘solution’ leads to a fantastic, permanent uptick into the superhuman realm for whoever takes it, he ignores Morbius’ pleas for restraint, leading to a series of destructive battles between the two in the skies above New York City. Much blood is shed, amidst an endless array of colorful vapor trails in the night sky.  Director Daniel Espinosa is a Swedish filmmaker who broke out big with Snabba Cash (2010), established himself in Hollywood with Safe House (2012), and followed that with the European crime-drama Child 44 (2015) and the sci-fi horror Life (2017), the latter of which showed he could take a vaguely familiar premise and turn it into a roundly entertaining thriller.  Taken purely as escapist entertainment, Morbius fits neatly into Espinosa’s filmography.  On the big screen, the dark palette looks appropriate for the dark story that is told. We are living in dark days, so it is fitting to see a dark antihero who is doing his best to resist his impulse to do dark things. The film opens in Dallas, Fort Worth and surrounding cities on Friday, April 1, via Sony Pictures.

"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," So here we are: another entry in Sony’s not-quite MCU, not-quite Spider-Man multi-villain series following the two oddly (but rightly popular) Venom flicks. Based on a character who originated from the wacky ’70s era of comic books (when Marvel had a Dracula title and DC had Green Lantern and Green Arrow team up to stop heroin addiction), this completely forgettable entry only serves to further prove how, despite their popularity—or rather: complete stranglehold on the culture—superhero movies have actually given their source material kind of a bad name: outlandish artwork rendered into ugly CGI and ambitious storylines as codeword for post-credit stingers. This might sound silly, but Morbius the Vampire feels like he deserves better. It begins with a flashback in Rome where we find two young boys, each with a debilitating and extremely rare blood condition, bonding over their mutual hopes for a better future only to see them grow into the esteemed Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) and old-money playboy Milo (Matt Smith). And their dream may have come true—we find the former something, something extracting blood or DNA or whatever from bats in Costa Rica and turning it into a serum that can cure their condition. Though of course, in experimenting on himself, Michael is becoming a vampiric iteration of the Hulk who wreaks havoc sucking the blood of innocent people. For a while there’s slight suspense this movie doesn’t have a villain and might actually become a classical monster picture where an anti-hero has to wrestle with himself. But inevitably [spoiler alert] Morbius’ childhood friend becomes a vampire, too, with whom he has to face off in the third act; at least he doesn’t become a bigger, veinier version of him à la most comic book movies. The two CG monsters smashing into each other is often a pretty incomprehensible mush of images, even when presented in slow-motion. Morbius faces the problem of actually making its character and his powers compelling onscreen. It’s odd that a full two decades after the first Spider-Man they haven’t figured out something more exciting and innovative than a video game character flying over a city, but sure—audiences don’t seem to have a problem. Not helping matters is that star Jared Leto is doing none of the obnoxious overacting that nonetheless livened up otherwise dreary prestige projects like The Little Things or House of Gucci. Relying on the 30 Seconds to Mars frontman’s sunken eyes and generally unwelcoming presence, his performance seems like another joke he’s playing on the audience and Hollywood in general—this time he can get away with phoning in as much as possible. If anything he might be the one superhero actor (outside Benedict Cumberbatch) with the most visible contempt for delivering lame one-liners. A lack of passion isn’t totally his fault, though. Stuck in certain four-quadrant expectations, Morbius is unable to transcend the lame PG-13 air around it; case in point is the film’s own Voyage of the Demeter sequence where Morbius has his first massacre (the victims are a bunch of innocent grunts) that’s obscured in darkness and quick cuts, ensuring it’s neither gory nor suspenseful. It’s hardly surprising with the whole enterprise steered by Daniel Espinosa, who’s made his name doing Scott Brothers cosplay (Safe House, Life) and seemingly didn’t get the memo to move past some Nolan influence. Note a scene of Morbius surrounded by bats scored to what’s nearly an identical copy of a Hans Zimmer music cue from Batman Begins (not to mention the often handsome nighttime cityscape shots that recall DP Wally Pfister’s work from those films). As an identity-less work, the initial charm of its relatively low stakes and brief running time only goes so far. If you need evidence of what’s missing, just look at Tom Hardy’s passionate levels of mugging in the Venom pictures, which showed that no matter how stupid and lowbrow the material seemed to the critical establishment—and even comic book movie fans—nothing was “beneath” him, and made them much more fun than any MCU title. Despite being almost objectively terrible, Morbius is sort of hard to get truly mad at. It’s a low-effort enterprise to the bone, like everyone’s dragging their feet around starting a franchise—the transparency of which might be clear to even the most casual moviegoers."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," In a sense, he’s the Marvel Comics answer to DC’s Batman. He’s been fluttering through the Marvel universe since 1971 when he was introduced in a Spider-Man comic book, joining Venom, Carnage, Doc Ock and the Green Goblin in the web-slinger rogue’s gallery of formidable foes. Leto has some background in playing in the comic-book sandbox, for DC as it happens, having portrayed the Joker in 2016’s “Suicide Squad.” He’s the main event this time around, oozing menace if not charisma as he agonizes through director Daniel Espinosa’s noisy, dreary exploration of the dark side of a very conflicted character. You think Bruce Wayne has personal issues that make him such a brooding crime fighter? Ha! They’re nothing compared to the demons dogging Morbius. Suffering from a blood disease that’s slowly killing him, he’s a brilliant research scientist (won a Nobel, but then declined it) whose desperate search for a cure has led him to combine human blood with the blood of vampire bats in a powerful serum. And hey, it works. For a while anyway. Pallid, skeletal and hobbling about on crutches, he’s injected with his lab-derived juice and instantly fills out, muscles up, walks tall and steady. Walks on ceilings. Flies. A miracle! But the serum effect is temporary and quickly reversible, so he needs more and bigger hits. What works even better is the real red stuff walking around in original containers. It’s a problem because he’s really a good guy who wants to cure people suffering from his ailment. People like his best boyhood pal Milo (Matt Smith, of “Doctor Who” fame). He doesn’t want to do bad, but when the serum is in him he can hardly control himself. And people die. And then he feels just terrible about that. Conflicted! Working from a script by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, director Espinosa brings little that’s new to vampire lore. The core dichotomy of the ostensible hero fighting the evil within (the serum) and the evil without (Milo) causes a lot of gnashing of those razor fangs, but it’s oddly uninvolving. And as is generally the case in Marvel-derived movies, the picture eventually descends into extravagantly overblown special-effects scenes, in this case featuring plenty of airborne vampire-on-vampire violence with Morbius swooping through Manhattan nightscapes trailing computer-generated contrails of lavender and orange in a manner reminiscent of bullet time. There is a romantic element in all this, with Morbius having fond feelings for his colleague and co-researcher Martine (Adria Arjona). We have to take the movie’s word for that as there is little detectable chemistry between the two. There’s also little spark in Leto’s performance. It’s the special effects, which hollow his cheeks, lengthen and sharpen his incisors and turn his eyes scarlet, that are the most impressive thing about him. Smith, on the other hand, throws himself avidly into his work, communicating a, uh, biting malevolence and sick glee in his portrayal. The picture only truly comes alive when he’s masticating his scenes. Otherwise, “Morbius” is dead at its center. By the end, it feels like a teaser-trailer to the inevitable sequel, which features a character from the Spider-Man pictures and promises, perhaps, a livelier ride. With Jared Leto, Matt Smith, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris, Al Madrigal, Tyrese Gibson. Directed by Daniel Espinosa, from a screenplay by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless. 110 minutes. Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence, some frightening images and brief strong language. Multiple theaters."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," Now, if I have learnt anything from Frankenstein, The Fly, The Island of Dr Moreau and Re-Animator it is that nothing ever goes wrong when a man in a white coat ventures this sort of hubris. Everything is going to be fine. Jared Leto is going to cure his stubborn blood disease, win over Adria Arjona and settle down quietly in a house by the sea. Speaking of diabolical plans, there are few so unlikely as Sony's scheme to build world-conquering franchises from the bits of the Spider-Man Universe that fell out of his suitcase when he ran away from home to become Tom Holland. It would require a top-flight legal boffin to explain who gets to monkey with which characters (a viewing of the current film raises more questions than it answers), but it seems as if Venom, a sort of id-forward Spider-Man, and Morbius, the world's second most popular bat-related comic-book character, are allowed to exist outside the formal Marvel Cinematic Universe. The plan is working surprisingly well so far. Neither of the first two Venom films were any good, but they both made mighty fortunes. It may not matter a tad that the incessantly delayed Morbius plays as if it were written with a crayon and edited with a chainsaw. Finally arriving on, by my count, its sixth scheduled release date — suspiciously high even for a Covid-era project — the film need only occupy adjacent Spider-Space to turn a profit. After an odd prologue that fits awkwardly into the main body, the film takes us back to two ill young boys in a Greek hospital. Dr Jared Harris (always welcome) enters and offers confirmation that their shared complaint is not going anywhere. Michael Morbius is sent to a school for the gifted in New York and gradually becomes Jared Leto. Milo grows up to be rich Matt Smith. The opening act of this mercifully brief film feels chopped down from a more lucid, but almost certainly more boring first cut. Morbius, now a gifted doctor, reckons doing something with bat blood may lead to a cure. He persuades Milo (I think) to pay for a trial on a big boat named — pay attention, Nosferatu fans – the Murnau and for the hire of various supporting hoodlums. The bat-blood infusion causes our antihero to develop a vampiric split personality. Formerly wan and phlegmy, he now looks as buff, coiffed and primped as that dubious tennis instructor your recently widowed aunt ran off with after the estate cleared. But if he doesn’t get his daily feed of plasma, his cheeks hollow, his teeth sharpen and waves of CG vapour spread round him like the sketched fumes around Johnny Fartpants in Viz. Where to begin with the issues? Adria Arjona, apparent romantic interest, looks to be going through some of the traumas that Geena Davis’s character endured in The Fly, but the scenes are so sketchy it is hard to say for sure. Maybe she just has a cold. The rapid shift from pre-origin story to full-on vampire wars is nauseatingly jarring. The computer graphics, though undoubtedly expensive, seem no more impressive than those in the average painkiller commercial. Most ruinously, there is too much Jared and not enough Matt. No harm to Leto, who wears less makeup as a vampire here than he did as a human in House of Gucci, but he appears to be taking the silly role absurdly seriously. It’s not Willy Loman, dude. In contrast Smith, whose character inevitably becomes the baddie, hams and twirls as if preparing for an infinitely more entertaining camp musical. Have at it, man."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," We
don't need a clear establishment of a character's role as either a hero or a
villain, even when it comes to comic book stories. What we do need for certain,
though, is a character with a personality, a moral code, a driving philosophy,
or any kind of distinguishing traits that go beyond some gimmick, some role in
the plot, and, in the case of those comic book characters again, any kind of
superhuman abilities. Morbius, which
is based on a character from the comics, is a bit unclear about whether or not
its eponymous character is a villain, a hero, or something in between, and
that's fine. He's simply not particularly interesting, and neither is his origin
story. Michael
Morbius (Jared Leto) is a doctor with a rare, unspecified genetic condition that
requires him to have multiple blood transfusions per day. The movie's mysterious
and strange opening scene has the doctor traveling to a jungle of Costa Rica,
setting up a trap in front of a cave entrance, and cutting his hand, allowing a
whole colony of bats to fly at him. This move by the team of screenwriters (Matt
Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway), which begins the story
without any specific information but right at the key moment for its
protagonist, is the last time the movie tries anything slightly different. Indeed,
the next scene undermines that initial strength. It's a flashback to 25 years
prior, seeing a young Michael (played by Charlie Shotwell) being treated in a
specialty hospital in Greece, meeting someone who will become his lifelong
friend, and showing enough intelligence at a moment of crisis that puts him on
the path toward becoming a world-famous researcher (He turns down a Nobel Prize,
which makes him a front-page story in a paper that's not the only connection to
another superhero). Back in the present day, those bats could be the key to a
cure for his condition, shared by his best friend Milo (Matt Smith), who is
under constant care from the doctor (played by Jared Harris) who treated the two
men when they were boys. Anyway,
the treatment Michael develops, with a bit of help from colleague Martine (Adria
Arjona), essentially turns him into a vampire, with an insatiable thirst for
blood every few hours and possessing several superhuman abilities. Those include
increased strength and agility, as well as the power of echolocation (or
""bat radar,"" he notes ""for the uninitiated,"" which is an odd
thing to clarify in his personal, scientific notes). His face also changes to a
bat-like appearancean upturned nose, hollow cheeks, and very point
teethwhenever he gets angry or hungry, and whatever trickery of makeup,
digital effects, or a combination thereof is employed here is unconvincing
enough that we understand why director Daniel Espinosa uses it somewhat
sparingly or obscures it until the climax. Michael
eventually learns to glide on drafts, too, which is somewhat unnecessary, given
his ability to run with such speed and leap at such distance that he leaves
behind cloudy trails of whatever color clothes he's wearing. Espinosa and the
visual effects team either believe that the confusing effect looks neat or know
that it's necessary to cover up for some additionally unconvincing effects. There
comes a point here at which we start to imagine the drab backdrops and visual
clutter on screen are more than just maintaining the mood of a vampire tale.
Everything is so intentionally dim and dreary, especially during a final
showdown in a dark gray system of tunnels (obscured even more by thousands upon
thousands of bats that later fill most of the screen), that hiding the effects
is made incredibly easy. As for comprehending what's happening amidst all the
distractions and obstructions, it's quite the opposite. The
plot is so routine that it almost doesn't need explaining. Michael keeps his
hunger at bay with artificial blood, but he knows the time he'll want the real
red stuff is fast approaching. That internal conflict and question of what he's
willing to do in order to survive become irrelevant, because there's obviously a
villain here, with the same powers as Michael but without the moral qualms about
killing people and drinking their blood. It's
the formula of just about any given superhero/supervillain origin story of the
modern era of movies, without any sense of humor, sincerity, or personality.
Combined with this uncertainand mostly dullprotagonist and those flimsy
powers rendered with shaky visual effects, the whole of Morbius
has nothing to offer except the usualand even that's a bit of a struggle
here."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," Dr, Michael Morbius (Jared Leto, surprisingly
unimpressive) is a brilliant scientist, inventor of artificial blood no less,
afflicted from birth with a rare disease that has a crippling effect.  Trying to find a cure with his research
colleague and fiancée Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), he concocts a serum mixing
his DNA with that of a vampire bat and then, in the usual foolish fashion,
injects himself with it.  Not a good
idea.  It turns him periodically into a
gruesome monster with an insatiable need for blood, though one endowed with
super strength and remarkable super-speeded agility. Michael is appalled by the carnage he wreaks, but his
friend Milo (Matt Smith, Prince Philip from “The Crown,” slumming here and
chewing the scenery), a wealthy invalid suffering from the same disabling
condition, takes a different view when he hears about what’s happened.  He and Michael had met decades earlier as children
(Michael played by Charlie Shotwell and Milo by Joseph Esson) in a clinic run by
Dr. Nicholas (Jared Harris).  Milo
doesn’t mind the side effects—sees them instead as invigorating—and takes the
serum despite Michael’s warnings, with lip-smacking results. That sets up a quasi-sibling rivalry (at one point Milo
actually talks about Nicholas having liked Michael better) interrupted by
inquiries from a couple of singularly inept FBI investigators (stone-faced
Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal, trying without success to serve as a bit of
comic relief in a picture totally lacking the crude humor of the “Venom” movies,
or any other kind).  It all ends in a
frantic confrontation between the two “living vampires,” in which Morbius
exhibits the power to summon thousands of bats to do his bidding, something even
Batman can’t do, despite his name. But its 144 minutes are quite tedious enough, especially
since the effects are splashy but messy, the result of director Daniel
Espinosa, cinematographer Oliver Wood and their team trying to do something
different—streaks of smoke and light streaming from the vampires as they swoop
about—that doesn’t come off.  On the
other hand, Stefania Celia’s dank production design fits the movie’s gloomy
mood, and Jon Ekstrand’s undistinguished score hits the beats expected in this
sort of picture. With due apologies to one of the few excellent modern
vampire films, “Morbius” might have better been called “Let the Wrong One In,”
were that title not already taken by a current horror comedy;  surely there are subsidiary characters in the
Spider-Verse more interesting than this. 
But like all the Marvel-affiliated movies, even the dreadful “Venom”
ones, it will probably be a big hit, a sad commentary on the choices made by
viewers nowadays and the start of yet another lamentable franchise."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," You can’t help but admire the boldness on Sony’s part to make the focal point of the Morbius marketing campaign the introduction of “A New Marvel Legend”, when the studio has evidently been aware for quite some time that its been sitting on a disaster, with the movie finally coming to theaters this weekend after being delayed from July 2020. On top of that, it’s clear the studio have tried their best to improve the end product after the fact, based only on the sheer volume of footage seen in the various teasers, trailer, TV spots, and promos that happens to be conspicuously absent from the theatrical cut. In the end, though, Morbius is about as bland as big budget blockbusters can possibly get, and it’s comfortably the weakest Marvel-branded project to come along in a while. There is admittedly potential in the premise, but the execution is roughly a million miles wide of the mark, with Morbius misfiring on almost every level. After a brief introductory scene that introduces us to Jared Leto’s medically-minded genius, game-changing creator of artificial blood, afflicted blood disorder patient, and rejector of a Nobel Prize, we flash back to his childhood for a relentlessly tedious exposition dump that’s supposed to serve as backstory and future motivation. Jared Harris’ Nicholas is the kindly doctor and father figure who inspires young Michael, while we discover the unbreakable bond formed between the future Living Vampire and the child who grows up to be Matt Smith’s Milo. Except his name is actually Lucien, even though nobody ever calls him that again throughout the rest of the running time. Why? Who knows, because it’s never mentioned after the flashback and doesn’t matter. That’s about the extent of the development Harris and Smith are given, and while the former unsurprisingly flounders in the “wizened mentor” archetype, Smith tries to do the best he can with the thinly-written material. Yes, we are once again in a comic book origin story where the villain is a twisted mirror version of the hero, but at least the actor’s scenery-chewing turn makes it abundantly clear that he knows exactly which kind of film he’s in, so he pitches his performance as such. After the kind of hokey science that’s par for the course, Dr. Morbius splices human and bat DNA to cure his ailment, and comes out on the other side as a buff vampire who must consume blood to survive. In a hugely fortunate coincidence, he created an artificial substitute so as not to paint him as an evil creature of the night right from the off, but eventually he’ll need the real stuff to survive. Along the way, Adria Arjona’s Martine Bancroft spectacularly fails the Bechdel test by slipping seamlessly into the one-dimensional love interest/damsel in distress role we’d hoped the superhero genre had moved well past by now, while Tyrese Gibson and Al Rodriguez contribute almost nothing to the story (bar a barrage of painfully unfunny one-liners) as a pair of FBI agents who don’t seem all that eager or enthusiastic about cracking a case that involves dozens of victims being torn apart and drained almost entirely of their blood. It sums up Leto’s career and reputation in microcosm that he delivers his most grounded and relatable performance in years while headlining a $75 million effects-driven story as a vampiric superhero, and he’s nowhere close to being awful in the lead. However, he plays it a little too straight given the silliness (a lot of it not being deliberate) that seeps out of Morbius‘ every pore, but his soulfully introspective antihero who got exactly what he wanted, but not in the way he was expecting, deserves a much better movie than what he ended up with to make a lasting impression. On a narrative level, Morbius is chaotic and messy, lurching from one scene to the next without a care in the world or even a second thought for such things as cohesion, well-rounded characters, or even an A-to-B plot that makes the smallest degree of sense or leads to any satisfying resolutions that couldn’t have been predicted by the end of the first act. That’s to be expected when the screenplay hails from Dracula Untold, The Last Witch Hunter, and Gods of Egypt scribes Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, so on the plus side, it matches the standards of their previous work. The visuals should be commended to a certain extent, with the echolocation offering a unique and distinctive hook with which to display Morbius’ powers, while there’s half-hearted attempts at adding some flair to the proceedings when the vampires are flailing around and leaving multicolored trails of mist behind them. That being said, the good doctor almost instantly masters his powers without so much as a training montage or any ‘getting to grips’ moments, setbacks, or obstacles he needs to overcome, so in the end it’s really just splashy window dressing for a horrendous final showdown. It’s almost as if director Daniel Espinosa has either actively sought (or been told by those above his pay grade) to undercut all of the things that could have made Morbius stand out from the identikit comic book crowd, with any sense of panache or style only being utilized for a fleeting moment or two, before we’re right back to mediocrity again. Far too many superhero movies devolve into a pixelated shambles in an effort to deliver scope and scale that hasn’t been earned or isn’t justified within the context of the setup, with Morbius one of the most egregious offenders in a long time. Good guy and bad guy are there, that much we can decipher, but the effects are so woefully inconsistent and the lighting so dark that it’s regularly impossible to try and understand, or even see for great stretches, what the hell is supposed to be going on. We haven’t even mentioned the post-credits scenes yet, which will only serve to make you feel bad about sticking around until the lights come up after subjecting yourself to the woes of Morbius. It’s the nadir of wink-wink Easter Eggs, name-dropping, foreshadowing, and clunky world-building, and genuinely leaves us worried about the long-term future of Sony’s Spider-Man Universe. Venom and its sequel succeeded largely because an underwhelming story was elevated by the undeniable charisma and 100% commitment to his bonkers performance that Tom Hardy brought to the table. Morbius doesn’t have that, despite the best efforts of several key creatives, and it’s another reminder that a couple of well-received movies doesn’t mean Sony has understood or learned from the mistakes that killed the last attempt to build a shared universe out from Spider-Man."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," The problems begin with Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless’ script, which causes only confusion over the many vague discussions about medical science and character mythology. In the first scene, Dr. Morbius (Jared Leto) visits a Costa Rican jungle to capture a swarm of vampire bats. Local legend suggests they feed on humans, though the average vampire bat does not. Are they supernatural bats? Why does his colleague Martine (Adria Arjona) later refer to their genetic material as “vampire DNA” and not “bat DNA?” And why, when he combines his DNA with theirs, can he transform his appearance, make wispy smoke trails, and fly without wings? Do the bats also have those powers? Despite being a scientist, Morbius never asks these questions. Perhaps we shouldn’t either. In any case, after gaining his new abilities, he finds himself plagued with the reality that he will not be able to survive long on his invention of blue artificial blood, which earned him a Nobel Prize (that he rejected for some reason). Will he let himself die before resorting to murder to feed? Or will he embrace his inner beast and feed on innocents?  Although these moral questions linger beneath the surface, director Daniel Espinosa (Safe House, Life) seems more interested in hitting the prescribed beats of a superhero movie. Morbius could be dealing with some serious identity issues, blood addiction, and questions of personal morality. Instead, he spends most of the movie contending with his lifelong friend, Loxias Crown (Matt Smith), whose wealth funded Morbius’ radical and illegal DNA experiments. In a flashback to 25 years earlier, we learn that Morbius calls Loxias by the name “Milo” because, in the Greek clinic where they were both treated by Dr. Nicholas (Jared Harris) for the same blood disorder as children, Morbius had lost someone named Milo. Afterward, he called every new young patient who arrived in Milo’s bed by that name. Unfortunately, the writers don’t make much of this devastating detail, which makes its inclusion even stranger. Rather, it’s only to establish that Morbius must confront his lifelong friend when Loxias sneaks a sample of Morbius’ serum and becomes an enthusiastic killer.  Morbius might have been diverting fun had the cast been more engaged, or the script gave them something compelling to do. Leto plays Morbius in a hollow performance that doesn’t have a personality beyond the character’s singular ambition as a scientist. Behind that beard and long hair, Leto’s look can only be called Christlike (or maybe hipster Jesus, especially when he wraps up those locks in a man bun). Much like Johnny Depp, Leto has become an actor who now only inhabits roles that require iffy accents, fat suits, wigs, color contacts, or other accouterments that do the work. But the problem isn’t so much Leto as the script that hasn’t made Morbius charismatic, funny, dynamic, or memorable. By contrast, Smith’s turn as the insatiable villain as least shows the actor’s willingness to go playfully over the top and have fun with his murderous role. On the periphery, Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal play two FBI agents investigating Morbius. Gibson looks wooden and sullen, but Madrigal offers a few funny moments reminiscent of Darren McGavin in Kolchak: The Night Stalker—where, without hesitation and minimal evidence, Madrigal becomes convinced the threat is vampire-related. Harris is mainly wasted, apart from a stirring late-film argument where he and Smith do some real acting.  If the villain and supporting characters prove more memorable than the titular antihero, then Morbius suffers from a common superhero movie malady. It isn’t the only one. Espinosa does the material a further disservice by delivering unintelligible, CGI-heavy action scenes of Morbius and Loxias flying around in two streaming blobs. Then, borrowing a trick from the Wachowskis (or, if you prefer, Zack Snyder), Espinosa freezes the fighting for ultra-slow-motion or bullet time sequences. Most of the action has little spatial clarity, and the writers have done such a poor job of explaining the rules to these powers that the confusing visual hodgepodge has little consequence or investment from the viewer. And, like most superhero movies, Morbius conforms to the PG-13 standard, pulling out the material’s horror roots. Despite the vampire scenario, this is a mostly bloodless movie. So when Morbius drinks bags of chilled red stuff to sustain himself, he never spills a drop. All the while, we cannot help but think about Blade from 1998 and its literal showers of blood. That movie managed to be bloody, true to its vampire trappings, and make a bundle at the box office—all with an R rating.  But Morbius has a sense of going through the motions. It’s not testing limits or delivering a worthy genre mashup; it’s turning over the latest product in Sony’s expanding Spider-Verse. By the conclusion, when the obligatory mid-credits scene establishes plans for a crossover, the movie raises unanswered questions about the character. Is he a hero or villain? The ending is ambiguous to the point of frustration instead of supplying a challenging aspect of the narrative. Usually, such ambiguity and open-endedness might make for a compelling character study. So would Morbius’ condition as a metaphor for addiction or his inner monster. Yet, this movie doesn’t explore these ideas with any depth—it’s content with being another building block in a larger franchise, and not one that feels inspired or even necessary, even though it had every potential to be something different. Morbius is what happens when a studio applies a horror filter to an average comic book picture. The filter may shade the original image differently, but it’s an unconvincing effect. "
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," About midway through Sony Pictures and Marvel’s Morbius—a monstrous union of bottom of the barrel intellectual property and fiscal year planning—Jared Leto’s title character is in the belly of the beast. Before this moment, Dr. Michael Morbius (Leto) has traded in his rare blood condition for a case of vampirism, a Faustian bargain that’s led the NYPD to finger him for murders throughout the five boroughs. Whether guilty or not, Michael reaches for Bill Bixby levels of grandeur as he broods and in a hushed whisper warns the coppers, “I’m getting hungry. Believe me, you wouldn’t like me when I’m hungry.” This might seem harsh for what on the surface is intentionally light entertainment—an attempt to mingle the bloodlines of modern superhero flicks with the far older lineage of vampire cinema. There are, indeed, elements that have as much to do with Bram Stoker as Stan Lee. During the opening sequences set in the jungles of Costa Rica, a then-disabled Dr. Morbius is told repeatedly by locals that he should not be traveling after sundown. Victorian chillers are echoed again when a container ship washes up ashore in New York harbor with (almost) every soul aboard drained of blood. Nevertheless, the conflations and contortions of this mash-up exercise never feel better than rote. It’s a mechanical product constructed from the ruins of other, better movies, and all in an attempt to make a Spider-Man movie without Spider-Man. On a certain level you must pity the committee room where Morbius was designed (likely repeatedly during post-production). After all, you can’t just make multiple franchises starring different Spider-Mans, right? Then again, after the success of Spider-Man: No Way Home, C-suite executives at Sony are surely second-guessing exactly that. Nothing about the version of Morbius they’ve unleashed on the world suggests they should do otherwise. As yet another Spider-Man villain origin story without the Web-Head, Morbius begins at a point of intrigue in the Costa Rican rainforest and then jumps back in time. From there, we go through all the familiar beats. First we meet Michael as a young boy as he dreams of one day doing great things after being born with a disease of the blood that leaves him pale, limping, and staring down the barrel of a short lifespan. As a kid, he also meets his instant best friend at a clinic, “Milo,” who conveniently has money and a devil-may-care attitude that perhaps covers up a dark side. Surely, that will not be relevant later. When the boys grow up, Morbius is now a bearded Leto while Milo is a callow malcontent played by Matt Smith. Both are still desperate to find a cure as time is running out. Luckily, Michael is close to cracking that miracle drug alongside Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona, wasted) at a lab Milo is funding. So once Michael realizes the cure may lie with splicing their DNA with that of vampire bats, well, what could go wrong? Just hire a team of blood bags security personnel and conduct the experiment in international waters. Faster than you can say Tobey Maguire, Leto is showing off a shirtless physique post-transformation, even as the film attempts to hand-wave away that he has to trip over more and more dead bodies to stay ripped. A film that’s been delayed and delayed again, Morbius belatedly arrives with a lot of curiosity and perhaps a fair degree of schadenfreude. But truth be told it’s not any worse than last year’s audience darling: the wretched Venom: Let There Be Carnage. Both movies are produced by Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach, and both feel like relics from the archaic days when mediocrity was treated as “good enough” by the fanboy community. Think Ghost Rider (2007) or Elektra (2005). And honestly, Morbius might be marginally better than that lot, including Venom 2, if only for not being quite so visually garish. However, the key reason audiences seem to have responded to both Venom mediocrities isn’t due to the prowess of storytelling or even the strength of shoddy CGI; it was to gawk at whatever the hell Tom Hardy was up to while playing to the cheap seats. Unfortunately, Morbius has no such ghastly-yet-entertaining performance to hold up this house of sticks. Perhaps remaining a wee bit sensitive due to the fair criticism aimed at his ambitious but flaccid Joker performance in 2016’s Suicide Squad, Leto plays Morbius relatively straight. He is neither fish nor fowl as a protagonist whom the audience is meant to root for as he searches first for a cure to his illness and then for his vampirism. But the role of a sympathetic vampire demands something of the operatic: a Jonathan Frid flash of charisma if not Tom Cruise’s full wattage. Instead Michael Morbius is, much like everything else in his film, perfunctory. Which leaves audiences with nothing to cling to as the monotony drones on courtesy of a tedious script that collects banalities as if they were seashells. Worse served, however, is Smith. Generally a fascinating character actor who makes clever choices in his television projects, be it as the title character in Doctor Who during that series’ glory years or as the Duke of Edinburgh on The Crown, Smith continues to be saddled with thankless villain roles in his Hollywood endeavors. And they don’t come much more thankless than Milo, a character defined by one characteristic—desiring a cure—and little else beyond a general smarminess. With echoes of the worst cinematic version of the Green Goblin in the Arad/Tolmach-produced The Amazing Spider-Man 2, here is a poor little rich kid caricature who just does things so there can be a paper villain to knock down in Act Three. Such poor choices reveal a startling lack of imagination on the part of the filmmakers, who set out to make a vampire/superhero hybrid and wind up settling for two CG blobs hitting each other at the climax. In any vampire story, the central undead figure should be the star, even if he is an antihero. But unwilling or unable to step away from the same template as Venom and so many other superhero movie bottom-feeders, this picture’s vampire conceit is wasted for a Hot Topic variation on a movie we’ve already seen done better and, maybe, worse. Director Daniel Espinosa and his team of CG animators have a few amusing flourishes—such as a CG black shadow trailing Morbius whenever he goes into superhero/vampire mode. The effect wouldn’t look out of place in a ‘90s era Mortal Kombat arcade cabinet. But when the whole movie is also just a beat ‘em up, no digital gimmicky (or bafflingly hackneyed post-credits scene) is going to hide how little life there is left in this bloody mess."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," 
As you're watching ""Morbius,"" you can already see it vanishing into the dollar bin of video stores long forgotten. It's one of those films like ""Jonah Hex"" or ""The Phantom,"" something pop culture will occasionally reference in ten or 20 years and we'll all think ""Oh, that's right. They made a movie out of that!"" But as destined as it seems to be set aside, sneered at and — even worse — unsequelized, this is also the sort of film you might catch late one night in a decade or two and realize it isn't as bad as everyone remembers.





A Marvel film far more interested in supernatural horror than superheroes, the flick directed by Daniel Espinosa (""Safe House"") was delayed multiple times and limps into theaters bearing all the scars of something that has been edited, re-edited, and re-edited again to suit different agendas. Plotlines vanish, major details unfold with minimal explanation, and — this being a post-""No Way Home"" film centered on a Marvel character — minimal, vague references to Venom, Spider-Man and the multiverse feel mandatory rather than organic. The third act sneaks up on you like a thief in the night, leading to an ""epic showdown"" that feels like the fourth or fifth best fight in most Marvel films.
Which is a shame, because there are some very interesting elements afoot in this depiction of Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto). After a spooky opening in a cave filled with vampire bats, we flash back 25 years prior to meet the future ""living vampire"" as a child, dependent on regular blood transfusions to stay alive. He is cared for by Emil Nikols (Jared Harris) and becomes friends with a fellow patient he dubs Milo (Matt Smith); the two young men pledge to do whatever they can to cure their ailments — and Morbius is smart enough to get to the verge of doing exactly that as an adult, engaging in advancements and experiments that could finally bring them health.





But while Morbius will make it clear later in the film that words like ""vampires"" and ""Dracula"" are within the realm of his awareness, he clearly hasn't learned any lessons from such stories. Long after every member of the audience will wholeheartedly conclude that his experiments are ill-advised and likely to have monstrous results, he's still injecting bat DNA into himself — and guess what? It turns him into a monster.

Thankfully, the Marvel elements of the film elevate it above your standard vampire flick. Setting aside franchises like the ""Blade"" and ""Twilight"" films and small outliers like ""Let the Right One In,"" most cinematic vampiric tales of the past couple decades have been uninspired public domain duds, from ""Dracula 2000"" to ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" to ""Daybreakers"" and ""John Carpenter's Vampires."" As presented in this film, Morbius is a character who ""invents"" vampirism to save his life, one who opens a Pandora's box and then is forced to deal with its consequences, desperately sucking down bags of artificial blood to keep his hunger at bay, but smart enough to know he can't keep it up. Say what you will about ""Morbius,"" but at least its origins — a Marvel character first published in 1971 with 50 years of storylines — gives this particular vampire some depth.





Every comic book film needs a villain, and although Morbius is about as anti-hero as a hero can get, he does (try to) not kill people and he does (try to) not turn others into vampires. This is not the case for Milo, who follows his friend down the vampirism path and then laps him, viewing his new reality as a long-overdue reward, embracing newfound health and athleticism, drinking deeply from the necks of anyone he deems his next dinner. The Milo character is horribly underwritten — what is his motivation, really, other than to simply be his best self? — but Smith injects madcap fun when the dialogue runs out. Half the time he's onscreen, it seems he's doing some sort of gleeful dance.
Leto, meanwhile, can't seem to decide if his character is supposed to be morose or mischievous. It likely isn't his fault (""Morbius"" feels like it was edited rather than directed), even if he is credited as an executive producer on the film. In some moments, he mopes so much that even the angsty, rain-soaked Pacific Northwest vampires of ""Twilight"" would tell him to lighten up; out of nowhere, he'll jokingly pretend to be burned by sunlight, teasing that he's ""not that kind of vampire."" This movie could have used more of that levity, but instead feels like a straight-faced ""Doctor Strange,"" bogged down in mystical mumbo-jumbo without the release of the occasional wi-fi joke.





Visually, the film also has its hits and misses. More than any recent blockbuster, ""Morbius"" suffers from that horrible trend where action scenes are shot so close up that you can't tell what's going on for long stretches of time; there's a scene where the character is tumbling through the air, and the viewer is rendered completely unmoored. On the other hand, a nifty ""swirl"" encompasses the vampires when they use their powers (a visualization, it seems, of their sound waves), frequently giving them the look of painted pictures rather than human beings. With all the comic book-fueled media we're seeing these days, such flourishes of uniqueness are appreciated.

But most cripplingly, this is a film that does a miserable job hiding its strings. When an inconsequential character enters a room during a seemingly quiet moment, carrying a machine gun and spitting out a sexist comment, clearly something is about to attack and kill him. When our villain needs a way to ""hurt"" Morbius without actually killing him, how convenient that he gets a front row seat for our hero's unearned, out-of-left-field kiss with fellow researcher Martine (Adria Arjona) — immediately marking her as a damsel ripe for distress. Two FBI agents investigating the rapidly-increasing stack of blood-drained bodies (Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal) are a threat when needed, then vanish for long stretches of time. A big deal is made out of Morbius' echolocation, but he rarely uses it; he'll suddenly control bats like Aquaman controlling fish, but we're never told why.





The sloppiest element of ""Morbius,"" however, has to be the one people are most likely to buy a ticket to see: the post-credit sequences. There are two of them, both equally confused, and both feeling as if the actors either weren't in the same room or serious ADR was used to change their meaning. Without going into spoilers, suffice it to say that you'll know even less about the future of whatever universe this is than you had when you came in.
When all is said and done, ""Morbius"" feels like a missed opportunity. Leto, like Heath Ledger with the Joker and Robert Downey Jr. with Iron Man, brings a charm and swagger to the character that is hard to deny. The film's supernatural elements are a refreshing twist on the Marvel movie formula, and there's a dark, goofy ""Venom""-like charm inherent in this material. Those three elements feel like they could be better served in movies focused on different characters; like Hulk in the MCU, perhaps Morbius needs to be a side dish that adds to the meal, rather than the main course.





Is ""Morbius"" a good vampire film? Actually, yes. But as a Marvel movie, it feels akin to Jennifer Garner's ""Elektra"" — a disposable could-have-been, destined to be quickly forgotten. Here's hoping Leto's Morbius makes like a vampire and someday rises from the dead, because seeing him sharing scenes with Tom Hardy's Venom, Tom Holland's Spider-Man or (especially) Mahershala Ali's Blade could be a lot more fun than this lackluster dud of a debut.

"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," In the field of cognitive science, there is a special kind of sound known as a Shepard tone. Invented by the psychologist Roger Shepard, it is constructed from a set of overlapping sine waves, and makes the listener believe they’re hearing a constantly rising pitch. But because of the  relationships between the individual waves, and the particular points at which each one swells and fades, the sound itself never actually changes very much: it merely gives an illusory sense of escalation, and a false impression of progress being made. In Morbius, the latest Spider-Man-adjacent Marvel project from Sony Pictures, the studio may have accidentally created the first Shepard film: it goes on for about an hour and 45 minutes, and right up until the second it ends, you keep feeling as if it’s just about to start. Jared Leto stars as Michael Morbius, a “living vampire” who has been a member of the Spider-Man rogues’ gallery since the early 1970s. Here he is, a world-renowned haematologist who attempts to cure himself of a rare blood disorder by splicing his own DNA with that of a vampire bat – an experiment that so flies in the face of every principle of medical ethics that it has to be carried out on board a ship in international waters, and which of course yields exactly the result you would expect. Along with an unquenchable thirst for blood, Morbius gains a thematically appropriate set of super-powers: echolocation; retractable fangs, claws, and snout; the ability to hang from and climb along the ceiling, and so on. The aim seems to have been to make Morbius a sort of swaggering New Romantic antihero – oh-so-enticing but deadly, with dark, flowing locks, a Mephistophelian beard, and a loose white shirt that billows under all atmospheric conditions. Alas, his computer-generated bat-like facial features slightly undermine the effort, and leave him looking more like a cross between Russell Brand and a Barbary macaque. Leto throws himself into the role with a steely commitment that would be easier to understand if the film surrounding him weren’t so thuddingly generic. When an early flashback shows the young Michael’s arrival at a children’s hospital in Greece, where he meets the doctor who will become his lifelong mentor (Jared Harris) and befriends Milo, the fellow patient who will grow into his future arch-enemy, you can already hear the plot mechanisms creaking like a galleon’s hull. And all that follows – the frenzied late-night research, the fateful injection of the vampire serum carried out by Morbius’s wary love interest Dr Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), the test-driving of the powers on disposable hoodlums, and so on – is origin story by rote.  Milo, played as an adult by an impressively game Matt Smith, suffers from the same blood disorder as Michael: he pinches a vial of the bat jab for himself and, thus fortified, embarks on a city-wide killing spree. “Make it mean something!” Dr Bancroft wails during his rampage. Honestly, you can see where she’s coming from. Every manoeuvre the film makes is less concerned with telling a coherent story than setting up the Michael Morbius character as a franchisable asset, ready to be mixed and matched at liberty with Tom Hardy’s Venom, Aaron Taylor-Johnson’s forthcoming Kraven the Hunter, and whoever else might receive their calling-up papers in future. Across two intensely bleak mid-credits scenes, which may have been shot at speed after the success of Spider-Man: No Way Home, a villain from an alternate branch of the Marvel content empire is pulled over into this one, like a footballer being loaned to a rival club. “Intriguing,” purrs Leto, in a voice that makes the possibilities sound anything but. Leto’s iffy custodianship of the role of the Joker in the unloved 2016 version of Suicide Squad at Warner Bros made him a polarising figure among superhero fans, while his latex-smothered, Joe Dolce-accented performance in House of Gucci elicited much tutting from critics – though I remain fairly certain the preposterousness was all intentional. But in Morbius – a film which at one point requires its leading man to stand inside a glass cylinder filled with a cloud of digitised bats and purr “I feel a kinship with these creatures. They welcome me like a brother” – you can tell it’s an accident."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," It’s ironic really. There were rumours that Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield might show up in Spider-Man: No Way Home, yet cast and crew denied it. No, no, no, they said. Fans shouldn’t expect extra treats. Then - ta da! - there were treats galore. With this Sony production, the third feature in the SSU (Sony’s Spider-Man Universe), director Daniel Espinosa implied there might be treats. And – ta da! - we get zilch. At press screenings, movies connected to Marvel comic book characters generally receive a round of applause. At Morbius, there was actual boo-ing. Just to be clear, neither Maguire, Garfield or Tom Holland are in this stinking mess of an “adventure” which is a relief. The lovely trio have not been soiled by a cash-grab so sloppy it makes you wonder if the top brass at Sony are nihilistic members of the undead. This is the origin story of one of Spider-Man’s foes, a blood-sucking anti-hero/villain who started appearing in Marvel comic books in 1971. The film was meant to be released in 2020 - before the hugely popular Venom 2 and Spider-Man: No Way Home (in which Tom Hardy’s Venom has a cameo). The delay hasn’t done Morbius any favours - we can’t help but make invidious comparisons. At the start of the movie, sickly scientist Dr Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) is in Costa Rica, bonding with bats. I’m not going to make jokes about him being bat shit, because Michael seems disappointingly grounded. He wants to cure himself - along with lots of wide-eyed, bed-bound kids - of a rare blood disorder. He’ll make a serum that mixes his DNA with that of a vampire bat. What could possibly go wrong? The first third of the film is bearable. We get flashbacks to Michael’s youth and his friendship with fellow invalid, Lucius/Milo. Back in modern-day New York, Morbius is still in touch with Lucius/Milo (Matt Smith), now a peevish Mockney who not only funds his old pal’s research, but seems to have a crush on him. And might the pair’s soft-spoken mentor, Nicholas (Jared Harris), who lives with Lucius/Milo, have incestuous feelings towards his adopted son? If you’re intrigued by these hot-house dynamics, don’t be. The film has no intention of exploring them. Morbius takes the serum and suddenly looks like a 90s pop star. Morbius also has a buff chest and a tan. Naturally, Lucius/Milo is jealous, so he finds a way to take the serum. Suddenly both men are zooming around, growling and causing chaos on subways, etc. The CGI fails to dazzle, (though I did like Morbius’s clever ears, which resemble the insides of a mushroom and are as strangely attractive as the webbed feet of The Man From Atlantis). In terms of the acting, the usually good-value Leto seems like his mind is elsewhere. Even the gorgeous Smith, lively at first, runs out of steam. As for the script, it gets stupider by the second. Dumb movies can be so much fun, but there’s just nothing and no-one to invest in. One death aside, Morbius the movie isn’t scary or tense. A boat is called The Murnau, a jokey reference to the German film-maker who gave us Nosferatu. That 1922 classic has fuelled so many nightmares. There’s no danger of Morbius doing that. It certainly isn’t sexy. Michael has a dull girlfriend, Martine (Adria Arjona; who must be so envious of Zendaya and Zoe Kravitz). Martine whispers, gormlessly, that she’s always found Dracula “romantic”. Good for her. There’s certainly no spark between her and Michael. Though Morbius is interminable, it also feels like big chunks are missing. My jaw dropped as I realised one particularly lacklustre kerfuffle was the last battle. A mid-credits scene, involving Michael Keaton as Adrian Toomes/Vulture (last seen in the Sony/MCU collaboration, Spider-Man: Homecoming), is the final insult. It. Makes. No. Sense. Fans love it when the SSU and MCU collide. But only crazed Marvel completists will be able to stomach Morbius. Tom Hardy’s blood-guzzling Venom earned the right to join the MCU party; Leto’s living vampire is the worst kind of gate-crasher. May he be escorted from the premises and never spoken of again."

Morbius, the latest entry in ‘Sony’s Spider-Man Universe’ – AKA the shared superhero world formerly known as ‘SPUMC’ – further pushes this particular corner of the comics-verse down the ostensibly darker road established by its sole stablemate, Venom. That Tom Hardy-starrer was a surprise hit, anchored by an enjoyably unhinged double act between Hardy and himself, but with this dull, derivative Jared Leto-fronted franchise non-starter, the SSU has SPUMC’d any lingering goodwill up the wall. Leto stars as Dr. Michael Morbius – a brilliant scientist suffering from a rare blood disease who inexplicably hits on vampirism as the solution to his ills. Powered up with super speed, strength, and nifty echolocation hearing, Morbius must consume human hemoglobin or risk the monster within getting out – a monster Morbius’ childhood friend Milo (Matt Smith) has no compunction unleashing on an unsuspecting public. Sticking rigidly to Venom’s anti-hero origin story formula, Morbius is a shameless exercise in comic book universe expansion. It’s slickly shot by director Daniel Espinosa (Life), who wastes little time getting to the action, and deploys every trick in the VFX filmmaker’s toolkit in an attempt to dazzle (copious slow motion, wispy particle effects, corkscrew camerawork), but a frustrating over-reliance on sub-par digital doubles means much of the film’s big ticket action feels underpowered, possessing the soporific qualities of a lava lamp. Leto is traditionally a supremely committed performer (some might say overly committed), but here he has the look of a man constantly thinking about his next manicure. It doesn’t help that the character is never adequately sketched, agonizing over a single patient one moment, brushing off eight gruesome murders the next. It’s a role crying out for a one of a kind, off-kilter performance to bring the material alive, something Matt Smith seems to recognise, but even his comically wicked dancing vamp can’t raise the film’s BPM as it flatlines. Frankly, Morbius is a film that will inspire utter indifference – competent enough not to be a complete waste of time, but nowhere near entertaining enough to recommend to anyone but the most dedicated superhero cinema completists. After 14 years of Marvel Studios perfecting and elevating this particular brand of crowd-pleasing, interconnected comic book blockbuster to its own artform, Morbius can’t help but feel like a film that’s slavishly following the same recipe, but getting all the ingredients wrong.

"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," In the unrelenting flood of superhero stories hitting film and television, you might well feel overwhelmed by the Spider-Men, Eternals, The Batman, and Moon Knight of it all. Well, I've got some good news for you: Morbius is totally skippable.  In an attempt to stand out, Sony's latest MCU-adjacent Spider-Man spinoff pitches plenty at audiences to see what sticks. Yet amid a barrage of stars, monster-on-monster violence, and science-gone-awry melodrama, what stands out most is everything that Morbius is not. Directed by Daniel Espinosa, Morbius follows Michael Morbius (Jared Leto), a world-renowned doctor in search of a cure to the rare blood disease that afflicts him and his childhood friend Milo (Matt Smith). In aggressive exposition scenes, the good doctor will explain over and over how their DNA is missing a puzzle piece, but that missing bit might be found in vampire bats. Like so many Spidey cohorts before him, Morbius plays test subject to his dangerous experimental science. Behold! He achieves a glow-up that turns him from scrawny, peaked, and limping to brawny, bronzed, and parkouring. But at what cost? Yup. He's a vampire now.  Known canonically as ""the living vampire,"" Morbius struggles with his new yearning for human blood, which initially pitches him into a murderous rampage. However, screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless treat vampire lore as little more than set dressing. So, there's an almost comical matter-of-factness to Morbius and his science pal/love interest Martine (Adria Arjona) discovering he's gone from sickly man to creature of myth. It's as if they're bored with the idea as soon as they learn about it.  Besides ignoring the fun that might be had with exploring the tropes of vampire horror, Morbius also fails to be remotely scary. This is in part because its titular bloodsucker is dedicated to not being a bad guy, so there's no chilling moral grey area to play in. Further vexing the issue, the PG-13 rating (which is generally demanded for studio superhero movies to make their money back from the widest audience range possible) means that like The Batman, the supposed hard-hitting violence is ludicrously light on blood. ""Artificial blood"" dyed bright blue, offscreen violence, and lots of biting scenes shrouded in shadow keep scenes squeaky clean and woefully un-scary.  That initial killing spree leaves a pile of bodies and a lot of questions. On the case is a pair of FBI agents, one stern (Tyrese Gibson), one snarky (a blessedly bemusing Al Madrigal). However, their chasing down clues is far from the center of the film, so it becomes just another element half-heartedly explored.  Madrigal brings spark to his wise-cracking cop character. But there's no actual suspense born from this investigation, in part because the audience is given no reason to think the blood-craving vampire couldn't just break out. After all, it seems every time he's in a pinch, Morbius uncovers a new power that can save his day — like the abrupt realization he can fly away!  It's not even a super-anti-hero movie like Venom or Venom: Let There Be Carnage. Yes, Morbius is based on a Marvel Comics character. So, it's technically a superhero movie. And it does include fight scenes, an evil antagonist, and a protagonist who is helped yet haunted by his superpowers.  However, defying the standards the DCEU and the MCU have forged in this genre, there's little in the way of heroics or derring-do here. He's not directly trying to rescue anyone or setting out to topple some massive malevolent force. Mostly Morbius is just cleaning up his own mess, trying to prevent the vampirism he released from making the world worse. But even this goal is abruptly abandoned to make way for the one superhero movie trope this movie hits hard: setup for a sequel.  Don't be fooled by the trailers that make mention of Venom, flash Spider-Man street art in the background, and tease Michael Keaton's return as The Vulture. Eddie Brock and his symbiote bestie are mentioned only as ""that thing that happened in San Francisco,"" and as an inexplicable joke, where Morbius identifies himself as ""Venom."" That's it.  As for Adrian ""The Vulture"" Toomes, he's not a part of the plot, despite what the trailers would have you believe. Slight spoilers: Toomes only appears in a pair of sequences that pop up awkwardly in the credits to tease a could-be sequel. As thrilling as it is to see Keaton's Vulture back in action, fans of the Sony Spidey-verse movies deserve better than the return of Leto's bland bloodsucker, who can't even brood with conviction.  Be it House of Gucci, WeCrashed, or Suicide Squad's Joker, Leto isn't much for subtlety. Similarly, Matt Smith has brought plenty of character to Doctor Who, The Crown, and Last Night in Soho. Yet here, both deliver dull imitations of their past performances. When his face isn't papered over by CGI-vampire features, Leto's expression is pretty but blank, as if he's in an ad for men's cologne. Playing more of a wild man, Smith gets to have a bit more fun, throwing his body into a frenzy of dance and occasional menace. Yet, in a realm where vampires are real and where we know Eddie Brock has leapt into a lobster tank, this all feels frustratingly timid, from the flat performances to the predictable plot points, the bloodlessness, and the shameful lack of style.  Grim greys and sickly greens paint settings that include unremarkable warehouses, laboratories, and hallways. The costumes are functional and forgettable, rarely fashionable or fun. Even the creature designs are unimpressive, feeling like a computer-generated ripoff of the Buffy The Vampire Slayer prosthetics. They're not bad, but neither are they fresh or frightening. No amount of slow-motion battle scenes can make up for that. In the end, Morbius is trying to do much, much more than the Marvel/Sony movies that have come before (which is saying something). But lacking in style, spirit, scares, and suspense, this would-be thriller is a toothless and tedious chore.  Kristy Puchko is the Film Editor at Mashable.

"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," Yes, we couldn't even come up with something more inventive for that headline, folks. But, quite honestly, 'Morbius' doesn't deserve it. Yes, we are surprised as you are that the oft-delayed and completely unnecessary adaptation of 'Morbius' starring Jared There Is No Method In My Method Acting Leto and directed by the journeyman's journeyman Daniel Espinosa is bad. Who could have seen this? How could we have known? Surely, there must have been signs, right? Every time a poster or a trailer emerged for 'Morbius', it was met with a chorus of silence online. Jared Leto doing a superhero movie? Sure, why not. In this day of fallen values and late-stage capitalism, we will all do a superhero movie eventually. And they will all have the same plot as 'Morbius'. World-renowned professional goes too far to save himself, his plan goes awry, gifts him with superhuman abilities but comes at a heavy cost. His friend or significant other is jealous, wants it for themselves, big bust-up at the end. Have you seen this before? Of course you have. It's the same plot that's been used for decades now. At every step of the way, you find that 'Morbius' has taken the safest, easiest option when it comes to its story and script.  'Morbius' is painfully dated, yes, but it's so much more than that. It so incredibly lacks imagination and vitality that, quite honestly, you have to wonder how anyone involved managed to turn up and do their work. Leto's vampire makeup, for example, is so completely uninspired. Think of something like 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer', for example. That was the '90s, and it had better-looking makeup than whatever CGI splooge they were using here. Also, if you're going to have a vampire as your central character, isn't there supposed to be some kind of sexiness woven into the fabric of it all? If you're not going to have that, then it's got to be bloody and horrific. 'Morbius' is neither of those things. When compared to 'Venom', which had the decency to be at least entertainingly bad, 'Morbius' instead is so disjointed and poorly made that it offers nothing of value. The editing looks like it was done with a rusted chainsaw, Matt Smith looks like he walked off the set of the 'Thriller' video when he's in his vampire makeup, Jared Leto's performance is as lifeless as anything he's done in years, and quite honestly, you're just watching this hoping beyond hope that Mahershala Ali turns up as Blade and beating the crap out of people while talking about motherf***ers wanting to ice-skate uphill."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," Starring Jared Leto, Matt Smith and Adria Arjona, Morbius is the latest film in Sony’s Spider-Man Universe (SSU). The film follows scientist Michael Morbius (Leto) as he tries to find a cure for his rare blood disease. Aided by colleague Martine Bancroft (Arjona), Morbius’ efforts see him try an experimental serum using vampire bat DNA that not only restores his mobility but also imbued him with superhuman abilities, as well as a thirst for blood. After the dizzying success of Spider-Man: No Way Home, anything seemingly related to the web-slinger would have to match or be in near sight of such high expectations. After the mixed reaction to Venom and its sequel, Venom: Let There be Carnage, there seems to be a determination to expand the SSU – but the plan to release a film about a ‘Bat-Man’ the same year as The Batman, which has already touted as the best films of the year so far, spells certain disaster. Singled out for his intelligence, Michael Morbius comes across as arrogant and rude who would turn down a prestigious prize rather than acknowledge his groundbreaking success in developing artificial blood. The story leaves him devoid of personality, making him obsessed with his work with his closest friend, the spoilt and overly frustrated Milo (Matt Smith), feeding his need for a cure as he also suffers from the same illness. Both are desperate for something to remedy their illness yet their respective circumstances have shaped them into two distinct personalities that guide the majority of the film. With Milo and Morbius having conflicting views on the ‘cure’, Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless’ screenplay becomes a predictable battle between a pair of two-dimensional characters. Along with an incoherent narrative and chaotic character development, the film delivers a laughable story so full of plot holes that it provides more questions than answers. One would think that Leto, whose career has spanned nearly 30 years, would have some sense in his choice of performances. However, after his OTT performances in Suicide Squad and House of Gucci, Morbius is the latest addition in a series of misfires. Despite being in the lead role of a superhero film, he lacks charisma and remains stoic throughout, with even his comedic efforts falling flat. In addition, Tyrese Gibson and Jared Harris feel wasted in their respective roles as FBI agent Simon Stroud and Dr Nicholas Morbius (no relation), as they could have helped build layers in Michael Morbius’ plight. However, Smith and Arjona seem to make the most of their supporting roles, with the former having too much fun. Behind the camera, Daniel Espinosa’s direction does little to lift the clumsiness of the narrative, as extra scenes and poor edits add to its confusing tone. Even the action scenes are a mess, as colourful waves during super-fast brawls with choice moments of excessive slow-motion come across as outdated and do little to add to the impact of Morbius’ abilities. Instead, the special effects just look flashy for the sake of it, rather than to entertain and thrill audiences. By the end of the film, it is clear that the SSU has a lot more work to do to be amid the MCU’s lofty heights. Dull, messy and badly executed, Morbius falls spectacularly short in terms of excitement or entertainment. Put simply, it sucks."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," In “Morbius,” a new shared universe of films inspired by Spider-Man characters, and now playing in theatres, Jared Leto plays a doctor who takes the old phrase, “Physician, heal thyself,” a little too far. Jared Leto is Dr. Michael Morbius, Nobel Prize-worthy biologist with a medical degree in hematology. His field of work is personal to him. Since childhood he and his best friend Milo (a preening Matt Smith) have battled a rare blood disease that drains him of his energy. As an adult Michael searches for a cure. He devises a cure, but it is it a cure or a curse? He will live, and maybe even thrive, but his life will be forever changed. The cure has transforms him into a transgenic vampire, a being with superhuman strength and speed, heightened senses, accelerated healing “and some form of bat radar,” but none of the usual weaknesses associated with vampires. Bring on the garlic and crosses. But, like traditional vampires, he now must drink blood to survive. “I have powers that can only be described as superhuman,” he says. “But there’s a cost. Now I face a choice, to hunt and consume blood or die.” He chooses life, but his tolerance for artificial blood is lowering and soon he’ll have to break everything he believes in and drink real human blood, a choice he loathes. Milo, on the other hand, chooses a darker path, pitting friend against friend. “All our lives we’ve lived with death hanging over us,” Milo says. “Why shouldn’t we enjoy life for a change.” It can only be said one way. “Morbius” sucks… more than just blood. Likely undone by a PG-13 rating that must have shaved off some of, what could have been, effective horror elements, it’s a defanged vampire movie with no bite. A generic story and dated special effects—the bullet time gag was fresh when we first saw it in “The Matrix,” but that was then and this is now—and the whole turgid affair culminates in a murky CGI climax that is visually hard to follow. You know where this story is headed, you just can’t tell what, exactly, is happening on screen. Leto is the above-the-title star, but his bland work is over-shadowed by Smith who at least seems to be having fun as the bloodthirsty Milo. There are two after credit scenes in “Moribus” that promise more stories with the batty doctor, but the franchise needs a serious transfusion before continuing the story.

After his divisive turn as the Joker in DC’s Suicide Squad, Jared Leto attempts to jump on the superhero bandwagon again as Doctor Morbius in the Spider-Man villain’s first standalone film. Once again, he misses the mark and winds up flat on his face. Michael Morbius is a renowned doctor whose goal in life is to find the cure for a rare blood disease that has afflicted him and his friend Milo (Matt Smith) since they were children. Morbius develops the cure using DNA from vampire bats, but when he tests it on himself he is transformed into a bloodthirsty killer with superpowers who requires human blood to stay healthy. Cue scenes of Jared Leto sucking bags of blood dry like they’re Capri-Suns. The central conflict of the film arises when Morbius denies Milo the cure, believing it to be a curse. In retaliation, an embittered Milo steals it for himself and frames him for murder. Whereas Morbius struggles to refrain from killing people with increasingly ineffective artificial blood, Milo inebriates himself with slaughter. Matt Smith seems to be having fun hamming it up as the villain here, gently drawing on the quirky persona he cultivated in Doctor Who. However, his moments stand out more as awkward blips rather than entertaining idiosyncrasies in what is otherwise a suffocatingly serious film. Smith doing a little dad dance over the corpses of murdered cops could have been raucous in an off-the-wall James Gunn film – here, it’s jarring. For his part, Leto lacks the wild eccentricity that makes Tom Hardy’s turns in the Venom films so compelling. Instead, he weighs Morbius down with a leaden performance, while the supporting cast is given little to do. There’s nothing in the script to give depth to these characters or their relationships. Jared Harris plays the doctor who cared for Morbius and Milo from when they were children, and serves as a surrogate father to the pair. But his role is emotionally weightless and he disappears for long stretches. Adria Arjona, meanwhile, is reduced to little more than hanging around as the charisma-deficient lead’s medical colleague and love interest, Martine.  The action sequences are similarly lacking. This is where Morbius could deliver a crumb of genuine imagination, but instead the audience has to make do with the gruel of muddy CGI in dimly lit locales. The conclusion to the climactic fight scene is so underwhelming that it’s easy to mistake it for a fake-out before a real finale to come. The fact that Morbius attempts to court an audience by dangling a potential connection to the Tom Holland Spider-Man universe is the worst kind of unearned fan service in a film this lacklustre. Compelling characters are the lifeblood of a good superhero story, so it’s tragic that a film about two warring vampires in the Marvel universe is utterly bereft of them.In UK and Australian cinemas now.

"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," It is a muddy puddle of a blockbuster; aimless, dull and lacking in a pulse."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," Ever since a deal was made with Disney for Tom Holland to play Spider-Man in the MCU, it’s been pretty much gold dust for the character after Andrew Garfield’s poorly received The Amazing Spider-Man 2. In the meantime, Sony have launched their own alternate Marvel reality in their Spider-Man Universe, giving Peter Parker villains like Tom Hardy’s Venom their own solo movies. Despite poor reviews for the latter, there has been box office success and the studio hopes for the same with Jared Leto’s Morbius. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD FOR MORBIUS. Originally shot in early 2019, The Living Vampire’s solo movie has been delayed for longer than No Time To Die and finally hits cinemas this week. Following Venom, Marvel fans were concerned Morbius could be another Sony spin-off dud after the dreary trailers, reminiscent of the bad comic book movies of the 2000s before Hollywood knew how to make a decent superhero blockbuster. Tragically, it’s worst than feared. And considering the competition over in the MCU, even with its recent misfires like Eternals, this is just a total embarrassment to the legacy of Marvel Comics and goes to prove after Spider-Man: No Way Home that Sony really can’t make a good comic book movie without Disney anymore. Set in the same universe as Venom, the film follows Leto’s Dr Michael Morbius, a scientist suffering with a rare blood disease, whose attempted cure gives him superhuman abilities and a form of vampirism. If anything, the basic plotline is similar to Edward Norton’s The Incredible Hulk, with Leto’s Living Vampire channelling Bruce Banner with the line: “You wouldn’t like me when I’m hungry.” Despite being a Spider-Man villain, Morbius ends up being something of a protagonist against his surrogate brother, Matt Smith’s Milo, who uses the “cure” to heal the same rare blood disease they share and become a vampire of sorts –although largely without the red gore despite the film being a 15. What follows is a tired superhero movie trope of the villain having the same powers as the hero but planning to use them for like evil or something. Again, much like The Abomination in The Incredible Hulk. This is particularly frustrating given that the star is often given stick for his method acting in recent turns as The Joker and Paolo Gucci when in reality he’s clearly a talented thespian who could have chosen something far better than this dire affair. Similarly gifted and sharing vampiric high cheekbones is co-star Smith, who gives his all to a role that feels tonally off from what Leto and the rest of the movie are going for. From the start, Morbius feels like a mess, with scenes edited onto each other in such a jarringly patchy fashion to be devoid of any coherent time flow. Morbius’ doctor fiancée Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) stands around looking pretty and seems to be being set up as a vampire in a possible – please no – sequel, while Jared Harris’ mentor figure Nicholas Morbius and Tyrese Gibson’s cop have a few pretty inconsequential scenes even when the previous is killed off by Milo. If anything, Morbius feels like a movie that happens at you, hoping for a big reaction but leaving the viewer cold. Yet at least there’s some hope for the character’s future in the end credits scenes, before calls for a final nail in this vampire’s coffin. As revealed in the trailers and spoilt by director Daniel Espinosa in a pre-release interview, Michael Keaton’s Vulture is indeed in the movie. He is the same character from the MCU movie Spider-Man: Homecoming and has crossed the multiverse into Sony’s Spider-Man Universe. In a clunky encounter with Morbius in the final scene, he suggests they team up against the Web Slinger – but which one? It looks like the studio are planning on uniting a Sinister Six, which would presumably include Hardy’s Venom and Aaron Taylor-Johnson’s upcoming Kraven the Hunter. Assuming they go up against Holland’s Peter Parker in an MCU movie, perhaps Morbius can be redeemed just as the villains of some of the poorer Maguire and Garfield films were in Spider-Man: No Way Home."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," Meantime there’s “Morbius,” where Leto plays not Batman but a man who turns into a bat man, vampire blood coursing through veins that manage to over- and under-act simultaneously. In the space between those words “bat” and “man” lies every indulgent, go-nowhere … unmotivated … pause favored by Leto, who won an Academy Award for “Dallas Buyers Club” and who went on to, among others, play the hideous Joker of the hideous 2016 “Suicide Squad” destined to be swept under Joaquin Phoenix’s rug. Leto: Not a no-talent. Not untalented. He has talent. But he favors a peculiarly enervating brand of intensity, deserving of its own two-word variation. It’s intense. In an itty way. And “Morbius” is an itty sort of Marvel movie, from Sony and Columbia, a little “Doctor Strange” drenched with gallons of “Venom.” Early in the movie the character of Dr. Michael Morbius, introduced originally in a 1971 “Amazing Spider-Man” comic storyline, turns down his Nobel Prize for inventing artificial blood and saving countless lives. The discovery was accidental, he reasons. The film, just this side of an R-rated melee, is one big fake blood squib. Struggling with a rare blood disorder, Dr. M ‘copters into Costa Rica to subject himself to a caveful of vampire bats. His research suggests a blend of human and bat DNA will cure him, and he’ll be able to save his similarly afflicted childhood friend nicknamed “Milo” (played by Matt Smith of “Doctor Who”) as he promised him years earlier. Aided by his research colleague and sort-of love interest Dr. Bancroft (Adria Arjona, the best thing in the picture), Dr. M sees his radical experiment through to the end. It goes not well, though transforming into a vampire has its perks: “bat radar,” aka supersensitive hearing, along with being able to fly like a bat. Here, with the most generic digital effects a medium-sized big budget can buy, the flying scenes have been rendered to look like Morbius is wearing a flight suit decorated with colored crepe paper. Much of “Morbius” sticks to a small circle of animosity and bloodletting and bloodsucking between Dr. M, Milo and Dr. Bancroft, plus a couple of NYPD detectives played by Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal. Director Daniel Espinosa, a filmmaker of Chilean roots based in Sweden, has made some passable-to-proficient action vehicles, among them “Easy Money” (2012), “Safe House” (2012) and “Life” (2017). The “Morbius” script by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless runs about 100 minutes without credits, but it feels like 150. Espinosa can do only so much, though now and then something happens visually, such as a simple hospital hallway sequence where flashes of motion detector lighting juice the suspense. An awful lot of the movie depends on the chemistry between Leto and Smith, playing old friends and new enemies. I don’t relish pinning blame, or a tail, or horns, or anything on a particular star/executive producer, in this case Leto, since so much in corporate franchise commerce has a chance to go wrong before a single performer gets in front of a camera. But my bafflement regarding Leto is becoming chronic, and I’m still recovering from his opera buffa turn and Chico Marx dialect in “House of Gucci.” In “Morbius” the actor’s willful disinterest in figuring out the rhythm of a scene, what’s important in it and how to bounce off his scene partners — well, it’s acting in a vacuum. What he needs is a director who can steer him away from his favorite scene partner, i.e., Jared Leto, long enough to activate the material at hand, even if it’s just a third-tier Marvel franchise hopeful.

"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," Forget the Dark Knight. In Morbius, Jared Leto is the Pale Knight, a serious-minded, soft-spoken biochemist in a ponytail who wants only one thing: To find a cure for the rare blood disorder from which he and a few others suffer, a disease which renders him too weak to walk without crutches and requires multiple transfusions a day. Leto’s Michael Morbius thinks the secret to a cure may lie in blood-sucking bats, who gorge themselves on the red stuff and somehow manage to process it just fine. He develops a serum drawn from their innards and allows himself to be used as a guinea pig, but the experiment goes awry: Though the secret formula grants him powers of superhuman speed and strength, it has also turned him into a vampire of sorts, a drawn, noseless creature with pointy teeth and talonlike fingernails. He must drink blood to function, and though artificial blood—which he happened to also invent—does the trick for a while, only that of actual humans may provide a long-term solution. And does sweet Dr. Ponytail really want to be that guy? How you feel about Morbius will probably depend on how much you have invested in the Sony-Marvel pie slice, and on your feelings about Leto, who perhaps isn’t so much a serious actor as one who takes himself very seriously. Still, his performance here has a quietly vibrating vulnerability; he seems to have made at least a small emotional investment in this film, as if to keep it from sliding into total special-effects-laden soullessness. His efforts pay off, nominally: Michael Morbius doesn’t want to be a baddie, though his ungodly urges keep pulling him in that direction. It doesn’t help that his closest friend from childhood, reclusive rich guy Milo (Matt Smith), who suffers from the same disorder, wonders why he can’t be healed as Morbius has. Leto is capable of portraying believable anguish and cautious tenderness, particularly in his scenes with the fellow doctor for whom he has “feelings,” Adria Arjona’s Dr. Martine Bancroft. Leto probably generates more facsimiles of real emotion than this slender yet clumsily extravagant movie needs. The director is Daniel Espinosa, and he, too, is probably a better director than this material warrants. (His previous films include the elegantly tense space thriller Life and the chilly child-killer mystery Child 44.) Some of the effects here are nifty: Morbius, with his special bat powers (which include extra-sensitive hearing—his ears have sprouted delicate mushroom-like gills) doesn’t so much fly around as flash through space, and when he does, he leaves feathery wisps of color in his wake. If the action sequences feel numbingly generic, at least they’re not noisy or assaultive. And for Nosferatu fans, there’s a sly F.W. Murnau joke. But if Morbius doesn’t drag, it doesn’t exactly whiz by, either. Espinosa may have been trying to distinguish his film from the dozens—are we into the hundreds yet?—of other movies spawned from the comic books of various universes, and his efforts do give Morbius a vaguely noble air. But in the end, we may not feel we need to know much more about Michael Morbius than this movie has already told us, even though a stinger alerts us that we’re due to see more of him in the future. This is a movie that feels like one big windup for something else, even if we walk out feeling we’ve already seen plenty."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," Following years of delays, Sony continues to expand their Spider-Man Universe with Morbius, following sequel Venom 2 and Spider-Man No Way Home. Based on the Marvel Comics character Morbius the Living Vampire, the horror-based rogue was originally a foe of Blade and Spider-Man, but throughout comic book history has been known to switch allegiances between tragically flawed antihero to a villain – which on paper, mirrors Tom Hardy’s Venom nicely. But, while the trailers teased a darker foray into brooding, gothic horror with exciting connections to the wider Spidey universe, the final cut leaves much to be desired – resulting in a surprisingly limp and formulaic origin flick.  Directed by Daniel Espinosa, Morbius follows the exploits of Nobel Prize winner biochemist Dr Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) as he attempts to cure a rare but crippling blood disease which threatens his, his childhood friend Milo (Matt Smith) and many other lives. As Morbius discovers a potentially life changing breakthrough after splicing DNA with that of a vampire bat, he takes a risky gamble and tests his new serum on himself, with the help of fellow scientist Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona). While initially, the enhancement appears a radical success which could potentially save thousands of lives, the subsequent transformation results in an overpowering vampiric bloodlust which proves hard to control. Following an intriguing cold opening which sees the doctor travelling to a dark and eerie cave full of bats in a Costa Rican rainforest – with his guides advising him he should not be traveling after sundown – the narrative jumps back in time to his childhood in an orphanage, shifting gears into a disappointingly familiar origins tale. What follows is an intensely bland and mostly bloodless tale which falls flat without the wider connections, as the majority of the much teased connective tissue with the wider Sony and Marvel Spider-Verse has been disappointingly cut. This results in an immensely disjointed narrative, leaving me wondering how many versions of the film were left on the cutting room floor.  While it certainly doesn’t live up to it’s teased horror roots, Leto and co. (excluding Matt Smith) play it surprisingly straight – resulting in a drearily dour instalment which is distinctly lacking in the fun nature and bonkers central chemistry of Tom Hardy’s Venom. The intently formulaic origin narrative from writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless hits all the recognisable story beats, harking back to early superhero outings such as Daredevil and Ghost Rider, resulting in a film which feels made by committee simply to continue building Sony’s Sinister Six for their larger cinematic universe.  Following his reportedly bizarre exploits going method as the unhinged, gangster-esque Joker, Leto has definitely restrained himself here, channeling a tortured and conflicted scientist with the best intentions at heart. But it’s Matt Smith’s flamboyant and hammy performance as rich kid Milo who steals the show, as it appears he was perhaps sent the wrong memo, mistaking this for the other Sony Spider-less outing Venom. The Doctor Who star revels in the ever increasing villainous turn, gleefully indulging his bloodlust in spite of his friend’s efforts to stop him. Unfortunately the rest of the cast serve as poorly underwritten supporting characters, including Adria Arjona as fellow doctor turned love interest Martine Bancroft, Tyrese Gibson’s agent Simon Stroud and even Jared Harris as long-term guardian Emil Nikols. While many were quick to judge No Way Home’s over-reliance on CGI environments and backdrops, Morbius comparatively features much more digital effects which are undoubtedly lacking in quality. The film descends into the typical beat-um-up third act, as the doctor and Milo go head to head in a blurry of blows (and pixels) as they fly across a dingy and colourless New York skyline, with an occasional dynamic camera movement and intriguing echo-location flourish. Their vampiric transformations are a result of ghoulish visual effects, with equally questionable bloodsplatter effects often peppering the lens. On top of that, the baffling post-credits scenes will certainly raise plenty of eyebrows, defying motivations and previous spells to further continue the expanded universe. For a darker, vampiric twist on the superhero origin, Morbius is all bark and no bite – resulting in a formulaic origins tale which descends into a CGI mess, relegating all of the more interesting connective tissue to the post-credit scenes. At least Venom is a relatively fun (but shlocky) outing thanks to Tom Hardy’s bonkers performance. Where Sony’s expanded cinematic universe goes from here is anyone’s guess.

"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," Let’s admit it, comic book movie fans have more spoilt than a supporting player from Willy Wonka in recent years. With those grandiose, richly crafted epics masquerading as superhero films, like the “Avengers” films and recent “Spider-Man” and “Batman” movies, anything even slightly less will likely be nose-thumbed. Comic book films have come a long way since the ‘80s and ‘90s, when thinly written, costume-over-captivation ruled supreme.  Sure, the odd gem seeped through the system, like Tim Burton’s terrific “Batman” (1989) and the highly underrated “The Shadow” (1994), but for every one of those there was a “Steel (1997)”, “Barb Wire (1996)”, “Judge Dredd (1995)” or “Batman & Robin (1997)”. It wasn’t really until Marvel Studios stepped up and challenged their hires to aim higher that the sub-genre became a real force to be reckoned with. Hacks everywhere sighed the moment Tom Rothman, Kevin Feige and Amy Pascal demanded more. Expect then to see the screwed-up noses of a legion of disappointed movie fans walking out of theaters this weekend after they catch the latest ink to celluloid adaptation, “Morbius”.  But again, only because we’ve come so far since a duck named Howard tried to get it on with humanoid Lea Thompson. Though set in the big-screen ‘Spider-Man’ movie universe – it ham-fistedly reminds us of the fact a couple of times with some shoehorned cameos and references – Daniel Espinosa’s trim, ridiculous and lightweight “Morbius” plays more like a superhero piece from the Reagan and Bush era’s (or one of those sequels to “The Crow” or “The Lost Boys” that were pushed out towards the millennium) than those gems that have come before it – many of which come from the same studio, Sony. The lengthy, surprise-filled and wholly engrossing “Spider-Man : No Way Home” – which Sony released at the tail-end of 2021-  – this is not. This is a short (running at just 1 hour 44 mins), punchy, old school good guy vs. bad guy popcorn movie that use to pack them in at the Cinedome on a Saturday afternoon in 1996.  Not such a bad thing? No. And if this had been released around the same time as one of the comic book movies around that time, like the original “Blade” (1988) or “Spawn” (1997), “Mobius” might even be considered a highlight for the sub genre. But “Morbius” is releasing on the heels of some of the best films the subgenre has released. Based on the Marvel comic book character of the same name, “Morbius” tells the story of a biochemist, Michael Morbius (Jared Leto), who has long looked for a cure to his rare blood disease. He comes across a possible fix in the form of bats, but when his experiment goes wrong, he inadvertently infects himself with a form of vampirism instead.  When his pal, the equally-unwell Loxias Crown (Matt Smith), gets wind of the ‘fix’, he decides to take it for himself – despite Morbius’s warnings. You can guess the rest. Featuring fun, immersive turns from Jared Leto (much more at home here as the rocker-like vampire scientist than he was as the clown prince of crime in fellow comic book movie “Suicide Squad”) and former ‘Doctor Who’ Matt Smith, “Morbius” is a film that doesn’t seem to strive to be anything more than a stylish, special effects-clad vampire flick that’ll keep you perfectly entertained on a red eye flight. For every predictable and unsurprising turn in Burk Sharpless and Matt Sazama’s script, there’s some punchy pace and slick production design to make up for it in the next syringe. What we have here is clearly a film that’s had too many cooks in its kitchen – what with the noticeably choppy, unfocused editing and wavering tones, not to mention an abrupt ending, all suggesting a better movie might have even existed before the film went into post. What’s possible is that Espinosa’s original cut resembled more its own beast, than something set in the “Spider-Man” continuity of films, and at the moment, what with Marvel and DC’s obsession to link every one of their film properties (especially after the success of “No Way Home”), the bean counters weren’t going to have that. It’s also possible, judging by some moments that cut away from gore and violence rather abruptly, that there might even have been a more welcomingly gratuitous cut at play originally. The studio needed to trust the filmmaker more on this one. Comfort food, no more, no less, “Morbius” does lack the bite of more recent, more ambitious comic book movies but it’s also not the ‘blunt Blade’ forecasters predicted either."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," Spider-Man universe movie Morbius stars Jared Leto in the title role, but this is a long way down from the standard of No Way Home – here’s our review. I preferred it when vampires sparkled. Say what you like about Twilight, but those movies have an eye for the camp, absurd elements of vampirism. The Cullens are golden-eyed, ridiculously earnest and drawn largely as caricatures, but at least they have personality. That certainly puts them a rung above whatever the heck leading man Jared Leto and director Daniel Espinosa are trying to do with Morbius. The film is the latest entry in what has been dubbed the “VenomVerse” on social media, with the more official moniker “Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters” delivering the decidedly unappealing acronym SPUMC. But rather than cash in on the impressive success of Venom and its enjoyably wacky 2021 sequel Let There Be Carnage, this is a mostly separate entity – making only a throwaway reference to “that thing in San Francisco”. Michael Morbius (Leto) is a brilliant scientist who has suffered his whole life from a rare blood disease, which threatens to kill him before he can find a cure. We’re told early on that he has already “saved more lives than penicillin” with his innovative artificial blood. But experiments in which he splices human DNA with vampire bats appear to have yielded success – with the small wrinkle of turning him into a grotesque supernatural beast with an insatiable lust for fresh blood. The chemist obviously didn’t put that side effect on the packet. Even before he goes all Nosferatu, Morbius is a chore to be around. Leto’s penchant for taking wild risks as a performer – albeit risks that sometimes leave him sounding like Super Mario having dinner with the guy from the Dolmio ads – is neutered here to the extent of absolute nothingness. Before and after his super-fiasco, Morbius is a miserable non-entity in a black hoodie. When he’s given jokes to deliver – Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless’s script sleepwalks through the superhero cliché canon – they fade in the air as he says them because the character’s persona is so anti-comedic. Leto is a Marmite screen presence, but his roles almost always feel very much his own. That’s not the case here. In stark contrast, Matt Smith takes on a villain role with all of the subtlety of a punch to the groin. As a childhood friend of Morbius who steals some of the scientist’s serum to cure his own condition, Smith exists only to yell, swagger and run menacingly at the camera in slow-motion. Given the stellar work Smith did as a loathsome, cunning manipulator in Last Night in Soho last year, it’s a shame to see him delivering lowest common denominator evil here. Women, meanwhile, are an endangered species in this world, with Morbius’s sort-of-love-interest Dr Bancroft (Adria Arjona) – the script tells us they fancy each other without so much as a biscuit crumb of passion – treated as a spare part by the uninterested narrative. None of the performers are helped by the fact Espinosa and his team set the movie in a New York City – actually mostly shot in Manchester – shorn of any amount of colour, energy or excitement. This is a sludgy, grey-green dirge of a movie – it’s like they applied a snot-coloured Instagram filter – which limps through its relatively slight, sub-two-hour running time with all of the intensity of a deflated balloon in a light breeze. Even the action scenes are rendered as pig-ugly blotches of dull pixels, with the climactic scuffle so colourless as to be entirely incomprehensible and any throat-ripping, blood-sucking fun concealed for fear of alarming ratings boards. The SPUMC – unwieldy moniker aside – faces an odd crisis of identity going forward, with Spider-Man: No Way Home's post-credit scene showing that the already quite flimsy partition door between universes is far from closed. Morbius mostly eschews such connections, save for the brief appearance of someone who was so heavily teased in the trailers. Golly, the less said about those scenes the better.

"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Even though there are flashes of promise, Morbius ends up being a bland and confused origin tale of the type we thought we had left behind."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," MORBIUS *** (104 minutes) M
One of the great things about the comic book movie universe version of New York is that however crowded and congested the city appears to be, there’s always a large, conveniently located vacant space for the main characters to have their climactic stoush in. We see it again in Marvel’s – whoopsie – Sony’s sufficiently diverting Spider-Man spin-off Morbius, a middling, time-killing superhero lark aimed squarely at Marvel/Sony movie fans with short attention spans.  As with most of the other action sequences in Morbius – and as has now become standard with big action movies – the final smackdown is staged in near dark, so it’s often fairly hard, with all the obligatory swish panning and splashy visual effects, to make out what is going on. With his trademark Jesus hair and beard looking fashionably shagged, Jared Leto plays Dr Michael Morbius, a Goth-styled scientist with a crippling blood disease  who creates a potion from vampire bat blood that temporarily relieves him of his walking disability and grants him bat-like superpowers. Much like the similarly stygian Spider-Man offshoot Venom 2, Morbius boasts a very lean running time; the film clocks in at just on 88 minutes before several in-credit teaser scenes buff out the duration to set up the next installment – another Marvel staple that is getting rather tired, especially if you’re all primed for a quick post-screening visit to the loo. That’s chiefly because the story has but two main focal points: the predicament Morbius finds himself in with his new-found power, and his new-found conflict with his similarly afflicted childhood friend Milo (Matt Smith, from Doctor Who and The Crown). Morbius needs to drink synthetic blood to keep going, but with his thirst increasing and the supply rapidly running low, he would have to switch to original recipe human blood, thus making him a full-on, legit vampire. Seems the sensitive new-age soul doesn’t have the heart to buy into the package deal that comes with being a fully fledged, card-carrying, super-powered vampire. Milo does, however. Having also benefitted from chugging the bat-blood serum, he’s relishing his liberation from his disability, which thus far has confined him to a plush apartment where his main visitor was life-long friend and paternal carer Nicholas Morbius (an under-used Jared Harris). Cue plenty of fights and chases that involve an admittedly snazzy variation on “bullet time”, the slow-motion visual effect created for the Matrix films. Looks pretty good. There’s also some nifty digital work where faces would morph from human, to non-human, and back again in an instant. It makes you appreciate just how far the art of the close-up effect has come since the John Landis 1981 horror-comedy classic An American Werewolf in London. The super-straight Leto brings some serious-actor heft to his performance, lending just enough gravitas to his fleeting lines about feeling alive for the first time in his life. All up, Morbius unspools as a fairly good, if gloom-laden jaunt, happily uncluttered by the tangle of poorly told sub-plots that afflict most superhero films. It’s a noble-enough addition to the superhero stable – sorry – universe, or whatever they’re calling it now.  Morbius is apparently part of this thing called Sony’s Spider-Man Universe, as distinct from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which conceptually it has to be part of, because Spider-Man is a Marvel character."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," To call Morbius, the latest superhero movie spun off from Marvel Comics properties, actually compelling would be overstating it by half. But there’s enough loose-limbed energy and competent filmmaking, plus an anchoring performance from Jared Leto that scrupulously eschews some of the showier or more self-consciously performative instincts which he occasionally indulges, to probably qualify this movie as a worthwhile investment of time for many of those who would be predisposed to care about its existence. Whether it checks all the boxes of full and complete fan-culture satiation is of course only for the terrible, terrible internet to decide, but there’s enough meat on the bone here to acquit this project, and its players. The story centers on Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto), a scientist who has devoted his entire life to studying blood-born illnesses since having been afflicted with one at birth which requires thrice-daily transfusions. A brief passage shows Michael as a child, bonding with fellow orphan Lucien, who he nicknames Milo; the latter grows up to be his rich benefactor (Matt Smith). For years this work has yielded prestige but little in the way of concrete breakthrough (we get to see Morbius turn down a Nobel Prize). One day, however, things change. When an attempted medical self-cure (the leaping-off point for many a horror film) held in international waters goes sideways, it leaves Morbius both imbued with pseudo-vampiric superhuman abilities (echolocation! flight!) as well as a crippling need for blood every four to six hours. It also leaves him riddled with guilt over a bunch of dead bodies on the ship. Milo, promised by his friend that research could perhaps reverse their conditions, snatches some of the test serum for himself and suffers no such remorse, setting up a surrogate-sibling showdown over the moral implications of living off of human versus synthetic blood, in addition to, you know, murdering people as a pressure release valve for years of pent-up hostility over being bullied. Caught up in this bloody, fanged swirl is Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), Morbius’ associate, who assists her research partner and comes to be rightly recognized by Milo as an instrument of human leverage in his battle with his fallen-out-of-favor friend. Movies like Morbius these days typically have much more on their minds than just telling one story well (even if it’s of an origin variety), and director Daniel Espinosa’s film is certainly no exception. The character originated in the early 1970s as an antagonist of Spider-Man, as well as an adversary of vampire hunter Blade. Given the hold of distributor Sony Pictures on Spider-Man as a property, they’ve been understandably quite interested in setting up their own parallel-universe rogues gallery of villains and antiheroes from affiliated comic books, to eventually provide a robust and lasting home base separate from the brawnier, bigger-budgeted Marvel Cinematic Universe. Compared to the execrable Venom movies (to which this effort nominally plugs in), Morbius is most definitely a step up, though in a perverse way it’s perhaps not likely to get credit as such. Those films, especially Let There Be Carnage, use their fusillade of “humor” to defend or defuse from critiques over narratives that are essentially colorful dead car batteries (plus awful special effects). Morbius has no such escape hatch. It isn’t grim and gritty, but neither does it lean into any lighthearted and winky asides. (Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal show up as police officers investigating mysterious goings-on, and the latter provides a soupçon of levity.) Unfolding in a slightly more recognizably level world, where a couple normal human characters do normal human things as decidedly non-normal things happen around them, makes Morbius seem almost radical at times. It’s a shame, then, that the screenplay, by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, is a purely surface-level type of thing, setting up story beats and pulling narrative levers with an automaton effectiveness that is also bit joyless, or at least free of any set pieces that will linger in an audience’s mind too long after viewing. There are intriguing possibilities for enriching subtext, both in the friendship between Morbius and Milo and in the manner in which the movie describes the pair’s reactions to red, human blood as primal, and the synthetic substitute as… less satisfying. But the movie seems to go out of its way to stamp out any truly complex same-sex feelings, delivering instead a nonsensically staged sulky, bitter stare in the rain during a kiss between Morbius and another character — a hacky scene that’s been worked to the point of death. Swedish-born Espinosa (Easy Money, Safe House, Life) is a filmmaker for whom facile genre mimicry comes easy — perhaps a little too easy. Those channeling gifts are put to more or less effective use here. The visual storytelling is enough to hold one’s interest, scene to scene, even if the action sequences themselves unfold as hyperkinetic flashes of color, summoning forth signature memories of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Coming off of his divisively hammy performance in House of Gucci, Leto delivers a very grounded and intense performance here; he invests in his character’s pain, at first physical and then emotional. He kicks to the curb any “method”-style affectations, instead leaning into the inner conflict in a manner that registers as simple and genuine. That’s the right decision for this character, and it gives Morbius a sturdy peg on which to hang itself (and, presumably, some sequels) should enough comic book fans turn out. The movie’s credit sequence tags, both occurring early enough to make sure audiences haven’t actually left yet, are duds as delivered, but do feature a character and narrative pathway which points a way forward for Morbius — and other Spider-Man villains.

"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL,"  Vampire Batman meets The Matrix in a rote and predictable anti-hero blockbuster. Morbius has a brilliant doctor with a crippling blood disease injecting himself with Chiroptera DNA. The film looks and sounds like a retread of special effects classics. If only the filmmakers had copied the quality of those scripts. The film's talented lead actors go through the motions of a textbook plot. Morbius has serviceable action but zero surprises.   We first see Michael Morbius (Charlie Shotwell) as a sickly child in a Greek medical facility. He meets the equally infirmed Lucien (Joseph Esson); who he nicknames ""Milo"". Both boys suffer from a rare and debilitating blood disorder. Their doctor, Nicholas (Jared Harris), recognizes Michael's astonishing intellectual aptitude. Twenty-five years later, Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) is the world's foremost blood expert. Having perfected artificial blood and saved countless lives.   Michael becomes obsessed with the powerful immune systems of bats. He believes he can combine their DNA with humans. Thus curing himself and his best friend. Michael's colleague, Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), thinks this is a terrible idea. She decides to help him anyway. Their efforts succeed with ghastly consequences. Michael develops incredible abilities. And a thirst for blood that transforms him into a monster.   Morbius could have been written by a robot that scanned the comic book source material. Everything plays out exactly as expected. The one-note characters follow a path that's evident from the opening minutes of the film. Jared Leto and Matt Smith, superb actors, needed a whole lot more to chew on. They are convincing as sick besties. That relationship sours on a coin flip. Their adversarial turn is contrived and poorly handled. Love can turn to bitter hate. There needed to be a better reason than the obvious lust for power. An opportunity was lost to explore the changing dynamics between lifelong friends.   Morbius, in vampire rage mode, moves fast and sees slow. The bullet time effect is used continuously during solid action scenes. He shreds baddies with bat-like movements. Then dodges their fired projectiles like Neo on his best day. The visual effects get progressively better as Morbius hones his powers. This skill evolution is the best aspect of the film.   The score and bat imagery is too similar to Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy. There are many scenes of Morbius surrounded by frenzied bats. We hear a rising crescendo that sounds exactly like Hans Zimmer's soundtrack. Christian Bale could have subbed in for Jared Leto. Imitation is the biggest form of flattery. But director Daniel Espinosa (Safe House, Life) and his composer, Jon Ekstrand, lack originality here.   Morbius should have been an R-rated film. The vampiric nature of the characters and narrative lacks a bloody edge. The film skirts the bloodsucking and graphic violence as much as possible. This was done for box office reasons. A PG-13 rating caters to a wider reach and younger audiences. I think a genuine, hardcore adaptation would be just as successful. Imagine Jared Leto and Matt Smith unleashed as ravenous super carnivores. Daniel Espinosa needed to take a page from Guillermo Del Toro's Blade II. Stick around during the credits.

"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE,"A throwback to the mid-2000s comic book film in all the worst ways. For audiences too young to remember what a lot of comic movies were like before the MCU - here it is, kids! This is what we had to grow up with!"
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," After a prologue about his childhood in a facility run by the caring Nicholas (Jared Harris), the story moves on a quarter-century. Morbius (Jared Leto) is now a revered Nobel Prize winner whose development of artificial blood has helped millions. Experimenting with human and bat DNA, Morbius undergoes a radical change, gaining superhuman strength and speed – and also a rapacious appetite for human blood. “You don’t want to see me when I’m hungry,” he says, a sly wink to that other Marvel transformer, Hulk, and his trademark “angry” comment. That, it should be noted, is one of the better lines in a threadbare script that even sees Morbius make a head-scratching reference to romance movie The Notebook. After Morbius’ “cure” goes disastrously wrong, leaving multiple people dead on a container ship a few miles off Long Island, he becomes a target for the authorities. But there are bigger issues when his friend Milo (Matt Smith), who suffers from the same disease, ingests the serum too and takes great delight in his new bloodsucking powers. “It’s not a curse, it’s a gift,” he crows, as he and Morbius come to blows. So often a dedicated actor, Leto offers little here (though, to be fair, he has almost nothing to work with), while Smith overacts wildly to compensate for his paper-thin role. Although the CG vampire effects have real bite, there’s very little that’s scary in Morbius. As horror films go, it’s at the anodyne end of the scale. At least the post-credits stings attempt to tie the film into the wider Spider-Man story, where Morbius may work better as a villain in a larger ensemble. On his own, he’s lifeless. Moribund, even."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL,"The complexity of the character appears to be there for the writers, but Sazama and Sharpless peel away many potentially interesting problems."
"Mar 31, 2022",POSITIVE," A monster movie with a little bite, Morbius is elevated by some spirited performances and director Daniel Espinosa’s sure hand with familiar comic-book material. Sony’s latest instalment in its expanded Spider-Man universe introduces us to the titular sickly scientist whose cure for his rare blood disease ends up transforming him into a ravenous vampire, played by Jared Leto with haunted gusto. This horror-action picture offers modest genre pleasures and a consistently spooky vibe, resulting in a film that has been designed chiefly to ensure future sequels, although the story includes enough emotional shading and robust set pieces to be an engaging standalone feature. Opening March 31 in the UK and the following day in the US, Morbius will hope to replicate the commercial fortunes of Venom, also based on a Spider-Man villain. Leto is an Oscar-winner who has dabbled in superhero cinema before, portraying the Joker in 2016’s Suicide Squad, and he is joined by Matt Smith, whose witty menace lends an extra spark to the proceedings. With The Batman’s stranglehold on multiplexes starting to diminish, Morbius seems well-positioned to take its place atop the box office — even if many viewers won’t have much prior association with the character. Leto plays the brilliant, caustic Dr. Michael Morbius, who since childhood has suffered from a fatal blood disorder that ravages his body, forcing him to use crutches to get around. Dedicated to finding a remedy for his illness — the same disease that affects his long-time friend Milo (Smith) — Michael boldly combines his own DNA with that of a vampire bat, and although the procedure gives him incredible strength and speed, it also leaves him with an insatiable taste for blood — in particular, human blood. After accidentally killing a few security guards in his heightened state, Michael is chased by the cops and must figure out a way to stabilise his terrifying new condition. As with his 2017 sci-fi/horror film Life, which liberally borrowed from Alien, Espinosa shows an ability to fuse different genres in Morbius, delivering a derivative but stylish entertainment. It helps that the effects work is compelling, accentuating Leto’s performance as the driven Michael who unleashes the beast within once he takes this volatile serum. Jon Ekstrand’s mournful score and Stefania Cella’s dank production design only further emphasise the film’s funhouse quality: once Michael becomes a vampire — and then, later, Milo — Morbius revels in its scary, suspenseful atmosphere. In recent pictures such as Suicide Squad and House Of Gucci, Leto has demonstrated a tendency to go broad, to varying degrees of success, and so, by his quirky standards, Morbius represents a relatively restrained turn. That said, the actor clearly savours Michael’s eccentric sense of humour and gloomy temperament, suggesting a character straight out of a Gothic horror story. But when Michael begins to wrestle with the repercussions of his experiment, Leto is largely reigned in, despite the scientist’s penchant for guzzling blood packs to quell his cravings. Smith is on the same tonal wavelength as his co-star, eagerly depicting Milo’s joy after secretly taking the serum, abandoning his cane and going out on the town with a cocky strut. Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless’ screenplay positions the two men as childhood chums who will be torn apart by their different attitudes toward their transformation — Michael fearful of what he has become, Milo drunk on his newfound vitality — but while the characters are not well-developed, Leto and Smith bring enough emotion to make their feud adequately poignant. At a time when too many superhero films extend far beyond the two-hour mark, Morbius is admirably succinct, producing some muscular action sequences alongside only a few egregious plot holes. (One kill sequence involving motion-detecting lights is especially effective.) Espinosa even finds enough room for a passable love story between Michael and his colleague Martine (Adria Arjona), who supports his research but worries that he is messing with primal forces he doesn’t understand. Hers is a reasonable, albeit predictable concern — after all, horror fiction has long been populated by scientists who foolishly dare to play god — but this consistently enjoyable franchise start-up manages to find enough new ways to tinker with the formula. Of course, the end credits contain a few bonus scenes meant to tantalise us with the possibility of where this series could go next. Such obligatory, unwelcome teasers risk sucking the fun out of what came before. Screen International is the essential resource for the international film industry.

"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," For a while, superhero movies seemed to be converging on one model. A quippy tone, lots of world-building, action sequences that weren’t exactly an afterthought but weren’t the main focus either: everybody wanted to be making Marvel movies. But since the one-two punch of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, the superhero multiverse has become a little more diverse – and with Morbius, Sony is looking to put its own stamp on the genre. Suffering since childhood from a rare blood disease, Dr Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) has devoted his life to the study of blood. So of course he injects himself with vampire bat extract and becomes a bloodsucking monster. But first we get half an hour or so of backstory, in which he’s basically cut from the same cloth as fellow Marvel heroes Tony Stark or Stephen Strange: a super-smart, top of his profession guy (he publicly rejects a Noble Prize) whose hubris gets the better of him. The difference is, he’s not quite as big a jerk as them. That’s reserved for his best friend and fellow blood disease sufferer Milo (Matt Smith). He’s both super-rich and a bit of a cad, which is a bad combination now there’s a super-serum around that turns you into a super-vampire.  Leto’s performance leans more towards the tortured, though he’s largely in leading-man mode here after a run of wacky supporting roles; Smith, on the other hand, gets to go big in fine style. It’s around this point that keen eyed viewers – or just anyone who’s seen a movie before – will start to notice the heavy hand of post-production editing. Supporting characters like Morbius’ assistant Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) lack the clarity you might expect (it turns out she’s his fiancée); others like Emil Nikols (Jared Harris) all but drop out of the film entirely. There might have been more to this story during production, but the version that made it to the screen is all about Morbius and not a whole lot else. So what about our living vampire? His new state of being definitely has its advantages. He’s now super strong, amazingly agile, has super-hearing and echo-location skills, plus when he bounces around his body is surrounded by a kind of black mist that makes it hard to figure out what exactly is going on in a lot of the fight scenes. The downside is that he needs blood to keep his strength up, and while the artificial blood that was his claim to fame (remember that rejected Noble Prize) does the job, its potency weakens with every drink. How long before he starts eating humans? If you ask the police he already is. The story that follows is so stripped back it’s hardly worth mentioning. The whole thing barely pushes past 90 minutes before the end credits begin and the real point of the film is revealed. Having introduced Morbius as a viable super-being in the mighty Sony manner, we’re presented with a couple of clunky post-credit scenes mapping out his future path to possible super-villainy in a wider Spider-verse. One, featuring a character heavily promoted in trailers but entirely missing from the film itself, looks built from footage designed for something else. The other features some superimposed CGI and a cast member almost certainly filmed in an entirely different context. Neither inspire a lot of hope for the future. Back in Morbius’ present, the film seems to solidify a specifically Sony approach to super-heroes first seen in Venom: Let There Be Carnage. These films are short, fast-paced, focused almost entirely on a big-name lead, and kind of refreshing in the way they don’t mess around. They’re a snack in a world of 150+ minute superhero banquets; by the time you notice the meal is lacking a certain something, you’re already out the door.

"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Featuring scattered storytelling and an unfocused script, Morbius is a huge missed opportunity. Leto is compelling, and his relationship with Smiths Milo had potential, but the movie struggles to bring it all together."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," After the staggering critical and commercial success of Spider-Man: No Way Home, you have to feel sympathy for the next film in line from Sony Pictures’ Marvel universe. That unfortunate mantle falls to the dreadfully disappointing Morbius; a flat, dull mess of a blockbuster that commits the cardinal cinematic sin of being unfathomably boring. Led by a genuinely lifeless performance from Jared Leto and drowning in a turgid disarray of CGI, it’s a forgettable experience that does little to justify its existence. Dr. Michael Morbius (Leto) is a gifted biochemist who specialises in blood born disorders like the incurable disease he’s suffered since his youth. Desperate to cure the illness that plagues both his life and his cherished childhood friend, Milo (Matt Smith), Morbius turns to an experimental treatment of mixing human and vampire bat DNA. While the procedure initially cures the doctor of his condition, it comes with a terrible price. Afflicted with a monstrous form of transgenic vampirism, Morbius inherits superhuman speed, strength, and hearing, but also the unrelenting need to consume blood to stop his affliction from returning. When Milo sees his friend cured, he believes their mutual problems are solved. But Morbius refuses to allow him to suffer the same fate, leading to Milo stealing the super serum for himself. As Morbius fights against his bloodthirst and searches for a cure to the, ah, cure, Milo relishes in his newfound powers and becomes a ferocious killer who’s causing carnage and murder all over New York City. With the police hunting down both Morbius and Milo, it’s up to the doctor to stop his best friend and prove he’s not the villain he appears to be. Coming off his batshit absurd Razzie Award-winning performance in House of Gucci, Leto feels like the perfect choice for the role of a dark and mysterious human with vampire tendencies. Excuse the pun, but Leto sucks the life right out of Dr. Michael Morbius, leaving us with a vapid shell of a character with absolutely zero charm or charisma. It’s like watching an anthropomorphic mop perform in front of you for 104 minutes. That’s largely due to Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless‘ flat screenplay that bizarrely avoids exploring Morbius’ classic anti-hero sensibilities and instead reimagines the character as an insipid do-gooder. There’s just nothing here for Leto to sink his teeth into (sorry, I promise that’s the last pun). For all the criticisms of his ridiculous “eyy, fuhgeddaboudit!” performance in House Of Gucci, at least it was entertaining. Leto’s turn is devoid of anything remotely interesting, which is a huge problem when he’s on-screen for 85% of this film. Instead, it’s left to Smith to breathe some semblance of life into Morbius. Sure, his villainous motivations don’t make a whole lot of sense, but at least Smith is having fun with his character. He chews the scenery in a menacing performance that’s far more engaging than anything Leto is laying down. Director Daniel Espinosa has no clue what to do with someone of Smith’s talents, so it all feels like a wasted opportunity. But at least Smith appears to be trying while Leto merely phones it in. There is a supporting cast of Jared Harris, Adria Arjona, and Tyrese Gibson, but they’re all completely underused and mostly just exist so that Leto and Smith have someone else to talk to. Arjona’s Martine Bancroft is occasionally injected into scenes as Morbius’ potential love interest without any time given to actually building their burgeoning romance before it’s forced upon us. As the stereotypical token female character in a comic book adaptation, she’s written as paper-thin as possible and there’s nothing Arjona can do to change that. The set pieces are often completely incomprehensible, though Espinosa does occasionally take a leaf out of Zack Snyder’s slow-mo guidebook to allow an audience to make sense of whatever the hell is going on. Ultimately, these slow-motion moments do nothing but expose how ridiculously cheap and shoddy the CGI work looks, especially on a big screen. The occasionally beautiful work of veteran cinematographer Oliver Wood is completely undone by every one of his shots being barbarically smeared in the strange blobs and blurs of two vampires going toe to toe. Morbius is so visually and narratively unappealing that I genuinely just stopped caring. Boredom is not an emotion one should feel when watching a film of this genre. Yet, when we’re giving nothing but a bland offering, it’s only inevitable to feel anything but lethargy and apathy. There’s a frantic attempt to provide some mild excitement with not one but two mid-credits scenes that tap into the multiverse, but there will be few clamouring to see another adventure featuring this new Marvel character."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL,The latest anti-hero saga deserves better than this meandering origin story.
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," After what seems like an eternity, the long-delayed Morbius is finally here. I remember the first time I watched the trailer two years ago and I didn’t like it at all. The whole footage sure looked like it was made in the 2000s era. The bygone era where the quality of comic-book movies was largely erratic at the time. And so, I chose to go in with the lowest expectation because who knows, Morbius might turn out not as bad as it looks. But first, the story: We learn that Dr Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) is suffering from a rare blood disease. His only chance for a potential recovery is to inject himself with an experimental cocktail of vampire bat DNA. A result that does not only give Michael superhuman strength but also turns him into a pseudo-vampire, where he has to sustain himself by drinking artificial blood. You see, Michael has a conscience and he wouldn’t go as far as killing people and sucking human blood, unlike his best friend Milo a.k.a. Lucien (Matt Smith). Like Michael, Milo happens to suffer from the same rare blood disease. He also turns out to be a wealthy man, who is responsible for financing Michael’s costly experiment. Long story short, conflict ensues between Michael and Milo, where the latter becomes Michael’s adversary. There’s an obligatory (and lengthy) flashback too, going back decades ago to see how Michael (Charlie Shotwell) and Milo (Joseph Esson) first met when they were kids. First of all, Jared Leto doesn’t overact as he did as The Joker in Suicide Squad (2016) and last year’s House of Gucci, where he plays Paolo Gucci with his god-awful Italian accent. His performance as the titular character in Morbius is subdued by comparison. But too bad the script — credited to Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless — fails to give him anything substantial to work with. I find it hard to feel sympathy or genuinely care about Michael Morbius’ fate. His overall character arc comes across as largely superficial. The film even botches the chance of delving deeper into Michael and Milo’s friendship and their subsequent rift, where they end up becoming enemies. Everything here is confined to a surface-level way of storytelling while it’s kind of baffling to see why Sazama and Sharpless were even enlisted to write the script in the first place. Not especially they were responsible for writing some of the worst genre films ever made in the 2010s including Dracula Untold (2014), The Last Witch Hunter (2015) and Gods of Egypt (2016). Morbius marks Daniel Espinosa’s first foray into the comic-book movie territory. Having seen some of his works in the past, he’s a journeyman filmmaker who has hopped from one genre to another with varying degrees of success. I wasn’t a fan of his two popular films, Easy Money (Snabba Cash) and Safe House. But his last directorial effort in his first Alien-like sci-fi horror, Life, was the only time I enjoyed his work. In Morbius, however, his direction is largely pedestrian. He’s more like a work for hire rather than a visionary filmmaker with a distinct visual style, even though he does offer some cool action moments. This is particularly evident during the scenes where the film showcases the character’s leaping and pouncing abilities in slow motion, complete with a cloud of colourful smoke puffing in the mid-air. The CG-heavy sequences are visually inconsistent, notably some of the vampire transformation effects and the incomprehensible final fight between Michael and Milo. Matt Smith seems to be having some fun playing the antagonist role while Adria Arjona and Jared Haris both deliver respectively decent support as Morbius’ fellow doctor and lover, Martine Bancroft and Morbius and Milo’s father figure, Emil Nikols. Tyrese Gibson shows up as one of the FBI agents investigating the case but his character is sadly reduced to a thankless role. Morbius ends with not one but two mid-credits scenes and all I can say is it made me feel like they are shoehorned for the sake of justifying its existence. Frankly, I’m not sure how everything is going to tie up altogether within Sony’s Spider-Man Universe. I guess we just have to wait and see but right now, Morbius is off to a lacklustre start."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," If it’s even possible to feel sorry for a fabulously handsome, award-winning movie star who doubles as a rock star and seemingly gets to do anything he wants, spare a thought for poor Jared Leto‘s super-villain movie career. Every time he picks what should be a plum role, studio interference ensures that the movie becomes a mess. Coincidence? Or inherent to the chaotic career of the famously committed thespian who is Jared Leto? His Joker was at least quirky enough to merit a return cameo in the Snyder-verse, but everyone will be better off if Morbius doesn’t make a return appearance. And should Leto ever be offered another comic book role, perhaps he should check to make sure he’s not playing a maniac with white skin again. Otherwise, he should say “no.” The hour-and-45-minutes of Morbius would work just fine as 30 minutes in a Spider-Man movie. Unfortunately, it’s not that. Like Venom and Bloodshot, it’s a comic book movie seemingly impervious to all of the improvements comic book movies have made over the past two decades. Unlike Venom, its intense lead actor doesn’t make out-of-left-field choices that save the day. Playing a vampire as a heroin addict by way of Jesus and Dracula feels obvious, and that’s a word not often associated with Leto. Leto’s Dr. Michael Morbius gets pegged as a genius from childhood, when he saved his friend Lucien from a faulty blood transfusion machine by fixing it with a tiny spring. This clearly marked him as the sort of genius who would go on to invent artificial blood, and insist on still calling Lucien “Milo” his whole life because he never wanted to learn his real name. Everyone else follows suit, for some reason, including “Milo” himself. Ironically, perhaps, Michael and Milo (who grows up into Matt Smith) both suffer from a rare blood condition in which pieces of their DNA are missing. Somehow, he seeks a cure in vampire bat DNA, because of the anticoagulants in their saliva which…do a thing. The movie doesn’t bother to take its science seriously, but at least it doesn’t expect you to either. Both boys should have just taken anti-aging tips from their mentor Nicholas (Jared Harris), who doesn’t look any different when the movie cuts to 25 years later. Morbius tests out his bat medicine on himself, and in short order becomes a super-powered vampire monster, which he learns to sort-of control. And in case Hulk comparisons don’t come to mind, a bit of wink-wink dialogue will ensure they do. His powers as a vampire feel arbitrary, and made up as the movie goes along. There’s super-hearing, which also turns his pupils temporarily into little asterisk blobs like Rick and Morty. He can glide on wind currents. He maybe talks to bats? And he’s surrounded in action by swirls of CG that don’t represent anything in particular. Maybe a Sony executive thought they looked cool in Bloodshot, and then realized  that nobody saw Bloodshot. But the swirls actually represented regenerating flesh in that movie. Here, at best, one could argue they’re anime motion lines. If you liked any of the trailer moments or early preview scenes, congratulations: none of them made the movie itself. Combine that with the extraordinary levels of on-the-nose exposition, including convenient news broadcasts that loudly spell out what just happened, and Morbius feels like the result of some heavy studio hands at play. Lots of key moments cry out for some sort of explanation that probably got lost to a previous cut, and key death scenes play hilariously hammy. Pity poor Matt Smith, after Terminator: Genisys, he is now 2-for-2 at playing major franchise villains in the absolute worst incarnation of said franchise. An old Doctor Who serial predating Smith’s tenure was called “The Brain of Morbius”; this new movie makes that title an oxymoron. Leto, of course, commits to the role of Morbius, with his crutches, cold sweats, and monstrous hunger pangs. What he lacks is a director like Ruben Fleischer to understand the absurdity herein. Daniel Espinosa, ironically the director of the Venom-esque Life, feels lost to studio mandates and CG fixes. What Morbius needed was a director to get Leto to ham it up even more. Lean into the nonsense. Because half-assed nonsense pleases nobody. As for all the marketing suggesting more ties to the multiverse…ehhh, not so much. We all know there’s a scene with Michael Keaton; now we can add that it’s rage-inducing and awful. That’s about it, really. Unless the movie includes way more subtlety than it seems capable of. The best thing about Morbius is it keeps the utterly obvious plot moving along, and isn’t exactly boring. But that’s hardly a ringing endorsement. Never detestable enough to merit its inevitable Razzies, nor as consistently campy as it occasionally becomes, this living vampire should have stayed dead, at least for now. Let Kevin Feige do a soft reboot of this character — hell, give Leto another shot in a more competent environment — and we can agree to forget this happened.

"Mar 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"Whatever, man - I liked it! A very good vampire movie starring Jared Leto and Matt Smith, both in top form. Similar to 2009's Daybreakers. As good a launch as 2018's Venom. Fun theater experience if you're into comic book movies."
"Mar 31, 2022",POSITIVE," The Sony/Marvel flicks (as opposed to the straight Marvel movies) are an odd lot. They resemble the superhero flicks we’re used to in superficial ways, but diverge from the formula in many others. Divergence from an established norm isn’t a bad thing, mind you, particularly in a genre as oversaturated as this, but Sony’s influence tends to result in dubious results like Venom (2018) and Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021). Morbius is the newest addition to Sony’s Spider-Man Universe and despite plenty of star power and arresting visuals, the result is a wee bit underwhelming. Morbius tells the story of Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto), a genius physician who suffers from a rare blood disease that is slowly killing him. In a last ditch effort to save his own life, and the lives of other sufferers of the disease, Mikey tries a dangerous experimental cure involving deadly vampire bats and ropey CGI. The good news? Ol’ mate Doc Morbius is cured! The bad? He’s also now a living vampire and requires regular infusions of blood to stay even vaguely human. It’s actually a pretty decent premise for a superhero movie, and in its early moments Morbius is quite promising. Jared Leto, who seems to veer from spectacularly awful (House of Gucci, Suicide Squad) to excellent (WeCrashed, Dallas Buyers Club), does solid work here as the conflicted doctor. However, after his transformation takes place, the film loses all sense of nuance and drama, and descends into a distinctly ‘90s-flavoured yarn, chockers with mawkish dialogue, murky CGI and weightless, incoherent action. A pity too, because you’ve got a decent supporting cast here that includes Jared Harris (!) doing his typically excellent work and Matt Smith, who looks like he’s having a good time vamping for the camera. The problem is, the script just isn’t at the same level as the cast, skipping through potential substance or nuance in favour of intermittently entertaining set pieces and the result is a film that feels increasingly disconnected from anything that resonates. It’s not a terrible film, mind you. It’s certainly an improvement on the first Venom (which is a low bar) and there are a few decent moments. However, by the time the climax rolls around you’ll likely have checked out, and the post-credit sequences are downright baffling. Ever since Sony and Marvel crossed the pop-cultural streams with Spider-Man: No Way Home, the potential for wild and imaginative flights of fancy has been high. Sadly, however, in the case of Morbius, it’s just another flat, rather ordinary superhero flick destined to be consumed, digested and forgotten within its release window. Fangs for nothing, Sony."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Running at 104 minutes, I was pretty impressed by its core theme: health is a privilege. "
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," Culture Representation: Taking place mostly in the New York City metropolitan area (and briefly in Costa Rica, Greece and Sweden), the horror/action film “Morbius” features a cast of predominantly white characters (with some African Americans and Latinos) representing the working-class, middle-class and wealthy. Culture Clash: A brilliant but illness-plagued biochemist named Dr. Michael Morbius finds the cure to diseases and death, but it comes at a price of becoming a superpowered vampire who craves human blood.  Culture Audience: “Morbius” will appeal primarily to people interested in movies adapted from Marvel comic books, but the movie’s weak screenplay ultimately lowers the quality of this already-mediocre film. “Morbius” works better as a horror movie than as a vampire superhero origin story that’s supposed to have a place in the “Spider-Man” franchise. “Morbius” has too many plot holes and not enough personality for it to ever be considered a classic superhero film. In fact, “Morbius” recycles so many familiar vampire clichés and action battle scenes, viewers will feel like they’ve already seen the movie before it even ends. And so, what’s a stereotypical movie to do when it doesn’t have a lot of new ideas to offer? It usually has to rely on the charisma of the cast members to engage viewers in a way that will make audiences feel personally invested in what happens to the characters. But that charisma is mostly lacking in “Morbius,” which has a very talented cast that is limited by uninspired dialogue that renders their characters as nothing more than generic and hollow. “Morbius” was directed by Daniel Espinosa and written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless. That’s not to say that “Morbius” is a complete waste of time. The movie’s visual effects, although not spectacular, still get the job done well enough that they look convincing in most parts of the film. And the acting isn’t terrible. The performances in “Morbius” just are not up to the memorable standards they could be for audiences who have become used to superhero movies where the main characters have strong and distinctive personalities. Even as an origin story, “Morbius” falls flat. Dr. Michael Morbius (played by Jared Leto), a brilliant biochemist, is first seen in Costa Rica with a team of people, as he entices a cave full of bats out of the cave, by taking a knife and using it to slice the palm of his hand with a superficial wound that draws blood. Considering that bats wouldn’t just swarm out of a cave because they saw or smelled a human being’s bleeding hand, this scene is supposed to show these are no ordinary bats. They’re vampire bats. “Morbius” then abruptly cuts to a flashback that takes place 25 years earlier in Greece. Michael (played by Charlie Shotwell), at the age of about 12 or 13, is in a children’s ward of a hospital when he gets a shy new roommate who’s about the same age. The newcomer’s name is Lucien Crown (played by Joseph Esson), although Michael insists on calling him Milo. This new roommate quickly goes along with being called by this new name, with the implication being that he’s got self-esteem issues and is desperate for a new identity. Milo uses crutches to walk and needs a machine to help him breathe. The two boys have health problems that mostly confine them to their rooms, so they know what it’s like to feel like outcasts. From their hospital window, Michael and Milo can see bratty schoolboys, who are about the same age, taunting them for having health issues. Milo asks Michael after one of these tauntings: “What would you do if you could be normal for just one hour?” Michael curtly answers, “I don’t think about it.” Milo and Michael become fast friends, with Michael being the more assertive and confident of the two. Michael tells Milo that they’re both in this hospital because they have the same blood disease and because “there’s something missing from our DNA,” so they are undergoing experiments. A scientist named Dr. Emil Nicholas (played by Jared Harris) is the leader of these experiments.  Dr. Nicholas is kind and paternal to Michael and Milo. Where are these boys’ parents or other family members? The movie never answers that question. However, people familiar with Morbius from Marvel Comics already know that Milo comes from a wealthy family, while Morbius was raised by a single mother. The Morbius in this movie never talks about his family or anything else about his background. One day, Michael saves Milo’s life. When Milo’s breathing machine malfunctions, and Milo loses consciousness, Michael is able to quickly solve the problem. He fixes the machine by removing a tiny spring of coiled wire. Dr. Nicholas is so impressed with Michael’s problem-solving skills, he tells Michael that Michael will be sent to a school for gifted children.  Before Michael leaves, he writes a letter to Milo in which he promises that they will see each other again. Soon after Michael leaves, Milo is outside and being harassed by some of the bullies who have found Milo carrying this letter. The harassment turns into an assault that’s halted when Dr. Nicholas comes to Milo’s rescue. The movie then flash-forwards to the present day. An adult Dr. Morbius is on stage in Sweden and about to receive the Nobel Prize. At this point in his life, he uses arm braces to walk. While a Nobel Prize official makes an introductory speech, it’s mentioned that Morbius was a prodigy who completed his doctorate at the age of 19. Viewers never get to see what happens next, but it’s described in the next scene. “Morbius” then makes an abrupt time shift once again. He’s now back in New York City, where he lives. Morbius works at a hospital and has built a scientific lab on a cargo ship, where he can do his top-secret experiments. While attending to a patient—a girl named Anna (played by Zaris-Angel Hator), who’s about 9 or 10 years old—she says to him, “I can’t believe you dissed the king and queen of Sweden.” Morbius then makes an anti-monarchist comment in response. What happened on the way to Morbius getting a Nobel Prize? A newspaper headline reveals that he refused the prize, after going to all the trouble of being at the ceremony. This was a missed opportunity for the filmmakers to show Morbius having an irreverent, maybe mischievous side that made Robert Downey Jr.’s portrayal of Tony Stark/Iron Man so fun to watch for many fans of superhero movies. Unfortunately, what happened on that Nobel Prize stage stayed on that Nobel Prize stage, only to leave it up to viewers’ imagination what kind of uproar Morbius caused at that event. Morbius’ closest colleague is Dr. Martine Bancroft (played by Adria Arjona), who is more cautious than Morbius is, when it comes to his radical experiments. She warns him that she knows he’s doing experiments that mix good DNA and bad DNA, and he could lose his medical license if authorities found out. Morbius is undeterred by Martine’s concerns. Martine later becomes Morbius’ obvious potential love interest, even though Leto and Arjona have little to no romantic chemistry together. Meanwhile, Morbius’ former childhood friend Milo (played by Matt Smith) and Dr. Nicholas are both in New York City too. Milo (who is now a flashy extrovert, in contrast to how introverted he was as a child) is eager to get the same serum that Morbius has been working on to cure them both of their blood diseases. Morbius tells Milo that he can’t have any of the serum until Morbius tests it on himself first. You know where this is going, of course. Because “Morbius” is a comic-book movie, viewers have to suspend disbelief that within this hospital, Morbius works in a lab with a large cylindrical cage full of bats. It’s implied that these are the same bats that Morbius got in Costa Rica. Morbius wants to see if he can solve his health problems by infusing his DNA with bat DNA in a serum, so that Morbius can not only eliminate his illnesses, he can also possibly live forever. Try to read that without laughing. A trial test on a mouse proves to be successful. And the next thing you know, Morbius and Martine are on the cargo ship off of the coast of Long Island, so she can inject him with the serum. Why have the lab on a cargo ship, which is out in the open and would put it on the radar of the U.S. Coast Guard or other entities that monitor sea vessels? Don’t expect an answer for that either.  It’s all just a way for Morbius to end up killing people when the serum experiment goes very wrong, and he finds out that he has become a homicidal vampire who craves human blood. A massacre ensues that leaves eight people dead on the ship, with Morbius and Martine as the only survivors. Martine’s injuries (she was knocked down by one of the ship’s crew members) leave her recovering in a hospital. It won’t be the last time she gets seriously injured in this movie. Meanwhile, the formerly sickly-looking Morbius finds out he’s now healthy with an athletic physique and superpowers, but he’s also a vampire who now craves human blood. Morbius is horrified and deeply ashamed of what he’s become, and he wants to make things right by trying to reverse the serum. However, he’s the main suspect in the cargo ship massacre, so he goes into hiding. And where does this fugitive go when authorities are looking for him? Right back to his workplace, where no one seems to notice that he no longer has to use braces to walk.  Two agents from the FBI are hot on Morbius’ trail: Simon Stroud (played by Tyrese Gibson) and Alberto Ramirez (played by Al Madrigal), whose names are not Mutt and Jeff, even though they act like Mutt and Jeff stereotypes. Agent Stroud is the stoic, no-nonsense type. Agent Ramirez is the goofy, nervous type. Agents Stroud and Ramirez are assigned to the FBI’s Department of Enhanced Individuals.  That’s why these FBI agents don’t really seem shocked when Morbius is brought in for questioning, and he starts to partially transform into a vampire right in front of them. Agent Ramirez brings holy water to protect himself in this interrogation, while Agent Stroud somewhat scoffs at Agent Ramirez’s fear of vampires. It’s enough to say that Morbius’ stint in a detention center is short-lived, and he goes on the run again. The rest of “Morbius” is essentially a “vampire on the loose” story, with the FBI trying to capture Morbius, who gets blamed for some more vampire murders that he did not commit. The movie falters in how certain fights involving Morbius (such as a major brawl that happens in a subway station) are treated as everyday occurrences and certainly not investigated adequately by law enforcement that has launched a massive manhunt (or is it vampire hunt?) for Morbius. But viewers can’t really take this “massive manhunt” seriously when Agents Stroud and Ramirez are the only FBI officials who seem to be available to show up and investigate the vampire crime scenes. The action sequences in “Morbius” liven up an otherwise dull storyline that lacks originality. Smith seems to be having some campy fun in his role as the adult Milo. Leto has done much better work elsewhere, although “Morbius” certainly isn’t his worst movie. The rest of the cast members are serviceable in their average roles. Two mid-credits scenes tease Morbius’ involvement with a character who was in 2017’s “Spider-Man: Homecoming.” Who this character is not a secret, but it won’t be mentioned in this review anyway, so as not to spoil the surprise for viewers who don’t know. Spider-Man and Venom both get briefly mentioned in “Morbius.” It’s enough to say, based on what the underwhelming “Morbius” has to offer, any future “Morbius” movies—just like many other superhero movies—might have to rely on Spider-Man to bring more excitement to the story."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," Sony Pictures' Morbius is set to arrive this week after countless delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Jared Leto starring film has arrived and the reviews are not kind, with its current Rotten Tomatoes rating sitting much lower than the original Venom. Our own review can be found below and it might be our lowest rated Marvel movie....ever? If there's one thing that can mercifully be said for Morbius, it's that it wastes no time making its character into the ""Living Vampire."" The scene when this happens is also its best, as it was clearly the set piece that director Daniel Espinosa had his heart in. POV scenes of a monster hunting mercenaries, who are present for no reason other than to be eaten, are the only remotely cinematic thing about this entire exercise of a film, though. There's also Morbius' goofball echolocation effects, a preposterous mist that surrounds him -- which seems like a studio note to make him look kind of like Venom -- that makes the visual language of the action nearly incomprehensible throughout; however, there's a moment where Morbius slashes someone's throat open and blood spatters on the camera lens that elicited a sensible chuckle from yours truly. This was the only time to laugh with the movie, as the times to laugh at the movie only multiply.  Jared Leto stars as the titular character, delivering a performance that feels like he's barely even trying. For all the faults you can pin on something like House of Gucci or Suicide Squad, at least Leto was doing something with those roles. There's also, naturally, the gross display of Leto playing a disabled character on screen, though the film's quick pace gets him off his crutches fast, yet it's still a facet of the identity of this role that drives him, and one of many moments in the movie that are deeply misguided. Opposite Leto is actress Adria Arjona, given the herculean task of playing his scientific partner and, at the drop of a hat, his love interest. Their relationship seems platonic until the movie needs it to no longer be that way, becoming at least beat #44 in the story that occurs because it needs to happen and not because there's a reason within the narrative for it to occur.  There are countless examples across the framing of Morbius that fit into this lazy and grating style of storytelling. Take, for example, Al Madrigal and Tyrese Gibson, who star as a pair of FBI Agents on the hunt for Morbius, and are subjected to some of the most baffling plot developments of the entire movie. A brief reference to the events of Venom apparently gives these detectives all the confidence they need to leap to ""a vampire did this,"" which is both hilarious as a viewer and baffling from the outside perspective. Matt Smith also has the tragic burden of starring as the film's antagonist, given the comical name of ""Milo,"" and some of the worst CGI effects to make him appear monstrous. Morbius needs a foil and all three of these characters are supposed to function as roadblocks for him, but the story barely has a foundation at all to even support antagonists against its lead. The spurts of genuine entertainment in Morbius are few and far between, and are so sporadic, in fact, that they could be accidental. What Morbius ends up being is a model of the lowest common denominator of cheap, studio, franchise filmmaking. It's not that Morbius is a bad idea for a movie, but the execution perpetrated within this film seems to believe that scraping the bottom of the barrel with comic book Easter eggs and CGI-heavy action will score this a guaranteed box office and fan interest. Marvel movie fans have developed an attachment to these storylines on the big screen because they're invested in what happens next with the characters and they like the spectacle, neither of which Morbius can brag about; or in the case of something like Sony's Venom movies, fans are getting something they won't get elsewhere. Morbius isn't doing anything you haven't already seen executed better. All of that is to say that Morbius has the worst sequel-bait for a movie in years, featuring an abrupt conclusion that feels like reshoots and pre-viz have become intertwined. Fans eager for connectivity to other Marvel movies and Spider-Man will also be greeted with perhaps the most hastily planned attempt at a tease that will only cause headache-inducing speculation. Spoiler alert: it's leading to nothing but confusion, as not even Sony knows what they're doing with it. The best possibility here is for none of us to ever find out what would happen next, because, frankly, who cares?"
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," It is kind of fun witnessing the absolute nadir of a cinematic genre. Watching an entire multibillion-dollar movement burn to the ground in such spectacularly stupid fashion – with the only arsonists to blame being the filmmakers themselves – there is a cathartic sense of relief. Finally, we can stop subjecting ourselves to this slop-bucket idiocy. At least, that is the hope: Hitting rock bottom should be the end of things, right? Unless, to borrow a now-ancient Simpsons gag, someone in Hollywood tries to “dig up.” Ahem, sorry, I needed to clear my postscreening rage. This is all a semi-tortured way of saying that there is absolutely nothing to admire or appreciate in the truly dreadful new superhero film Morbius. A hack-tastic effort in turning golden intellectual property into lung-clogging coal, director Daniel Espinosa’s movie is irredeemable in every fashion. It is charmless, incoherent, ugly and so aggressively stupid that it defies any attempt to shove it into the desperate “guilty pleasure” box. There is simply no joy here, even for those (like me!) who can appreciate a nonsensical CGI spectacle that knows it is silly nothingness, and only asks its audience to forget their worries for 90 minutes and play along. In Morbius, there is no playing along, no guilty pleasures to be found – only dreadfully boring pain. So much pain. Focusing on one of Marvel’s lesser-known Spider-Man frenemies, Morbius follows the origin story of one Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto), a brilliant scientist who is almost as good at his job as he is at wearing unbuttoned shirts and keeping his hair silky smooth. As Michael searches for a cure to his lifelong ailment (which goes unnamed, but involves being unable to walk without assistance and the need for regular blood transfusions), he creates a bat-human DNA hybrid serum that just might cure all of humanity’s illnesses. The catch (there’s always a catch!): Michael’s formula turns him into a vampire every now and then. Hate how that happens. This all sets up a battle between Michael, the skeptical authorities (led by a sleepwalking Tyrese Gibson, missing his more charismatic Fast & Furious co-stars and their dumb-but-fun megafranchise), and Michael’s benefactor/best friend, the fabulously rich Lucien (Matt Smith), whose wealth – like every other plot point in this film – is never clearly explained. Will Michael find a cure for his vampirism before he resorts to draining innocents of their blood? Will Lucien turn Michael’s invention against him? Will the hundreds of CGI artists responsible for creating the film’s many blurry digital bats ever recover from the mundane task set before them? You don’t need to subject yourself to a viewing of Morbius to figure out the answers. This is a bloodless vampire film, a cardboard-cheap superhero spectacle and a star vehicle for a star caught asleep at the wheel. Where is that bonkers House of Gucci energy at, Jared Leto? I’ll even take your cringe-y Joker act over Morbius’s aggravating blah-ness. Still, you might be tempted to watch Morbius in order to complete your understanding of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as this film is being marketed as a quasi Spider-Man spin-off, much like last year’s also-bad-but-not-nearly-as-terrible Venom: Let There Be Carnage. Sure, that is sort of vaguely true, thanks to the complicated mechanics of the licensing deals between Sony Pictures and Disney. But, please, I am begging you: Just search for the Morbius postcredits scene online (it’s already leaked on Twitter) and leave it at that. Actually, no: You won’t even be able to “leave it at that,” because Morbius’s postcredits bit of corporate synergy – which has been reworked from the small bits and pieces glimpsed in the film’s original trailers – makes no real canonical sense from even a multiverse perspective. Take it from me, an almost talmudic scholar of these things: There is nothing in Morbius that will further your appreciation or understanding of Spider-Man: No Way Home, or Venom, or any other Marvel movie. The film’s few final seconds represent a middle finger of a tease to fans, and if there is any justice in Hollywood – a long shot these smack-down days, I realize – Morbius will be retconned to the margins of superhero-cinema history."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," ★☆☆☆☆The cinematic equivalent of Murphy’s Law is demonstrated by this appalling superhero snooze-fest. It’s a movie without dramatic jeopardy, originality, narrative coherence, compelling characters or a single even vaguely human performance. The story of vampire antihero Michael Morbius (Jared Leto in stoned mannequin mode) and his fascinating quest to, er, um, drink only artificially manufactured blood has apparently been in development for over 20 years and finished principal photography in June 2019. It was finally unveiled last night, just hours before its nationwide release, and it appears, at best, to be an example of mainstream movie entertainment in which everything that could’ve gone wrong did go wrong, and spectacularly so."
"Mar 31, 2022",POSITIVE," Superheroes have, to hear marketing professionals tell it, wormed their way into conspiracy thrillers, family comedies, grief dramas, and other genres outside the specific confines of bodysuit rock-’em-sock-’em. It’s a natural evolution, then, that a superhero should find himself in the realm of horror. Enter Dr. Michael Morbius, the titular figurehead of the new film Morbius (in theaters April 1). A dying scientist who mutates himself into a half-man, half-bat creature in an effort to cure himself of a blood disorder, Morbius is, for all intents and purposes, a vampire. Boo! The curious fun of Daniel Espinosa’s film is in how it embraces the gothic mythology that inspired it. Morbius does eventually become a cluttered slugfest, as all things must. But for much of its run it is a stylish, intriguingly toned story of a man trying to thwart mortality.  The film opens on an ominous cave in a remote Costa Rican jungle. It then jumps back in time to a stately residential children’s hospital in Greece that seems more 1930s than 1995, before catching us up to the present in a looming and night-lit version of New York City. Morbius has a sense of place—and an interest in interesting places—that distinguishes it from the gleaming, anonymous Atlanta pop of so many other superhero films.  Does Morbius know that, in all its shiver and portent and moody eyes and long hair, it’s a little silly? I think so—a few vampire jokes peppered throughout suggest as much. So does the presence of Jared Leto, our aging screamo prince and a committed chameleon of an actor. But blessedly, the film does not try to court knowing chuckles; there is none of Venom’s creaky snark here. Morbius has a seriousness of intent, and is all the more engaging for it.  Dr. Morbius is steadfastly devoted to his work, and principled about it. He’s just turned down a Nobel Prize because he will not accept accolades for an unfinished experiment. He’s got good bedside manner with children, a soft touch contrasted by the fact that he is usually dressed like Johnny Cash at Milan Fashion Week. There’s a possible romantic interest in his orbit, fellow doctor Martine (Adria Arjona), but the real love of his life is Milo (Matt Smith), a childhood friend from that Greek hospital who lives in frustrated opulence in an ornately appointed Manhattan apartment.  Milo has a Sebastian Flyte flounce about him. He’s a bored aristocrat, gloomy about his failing health (he has the same vague affliction as Morbius does) and funneling as much cash as he can into Morbius’s research. Bonded by their lonely childhoods and now a mounting desperation to escape their circumstances, Morbius and Milo share a more complicated rapport—and a more deeply homosocial one—than do many a hero-villain pairing in movies such as this. Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes wish they had this brothers-in-misery chemistry, all its boarding school angst and platonic passion.  This also makes Milo a better villain than we often get from the CGI content factories; he gives Morbius something like literary stakes. While Leto humbly gets out of his way, Smith—who already looks like a vampire without all the makeup—plays his part with an alluringly haughty menace. Particularly in a well-worded scene in which Milo argues with his longtime caregiver/father figure, played by Jared Harris. (Matt Sazama and the gloriously named Burk Sharpless wrote the screenplay.) There is something strangely sophisticated about the milieu of Morbius, its sad fancy boys pouring their resources into a mad bid to gain mastery over their fate. It’s almost Mary Shelley.  Espinosa—who tends to elevate the standard-issue genre films he’s handed (look to his terrifically unsettling, and underseen, alien thriller Life for the most compelling evidence of that)—brings this tortured human drama to the fore while surrounding it with the whizbang required of a studio project. The New York he’s cobbled together out of locations in London and Manchester is appropriately teeming and sinister, while the special effects are mostly used with pleasing visual purpose.  Once Morbius has taken a risky cure of his own making, melding his DNA with that of Costa Rican vampire bats, he rapidly develops new abilities, which include acrobatics and, eventually, flight. To illustrate that speed, Morbius’s high-flying produces a vaporous trail, just as the Death Eaters do in the Harry Potter franchise. The device is a bit derivative in that way, but it looks nice, even when the necessary climactic battle sequence teeters into incoherence. Morbius is, of course, part of a larger Sony/Marvel enterprise that will likely be bound together into some kind of Avengers-esque movie involving Venom and one of myriad possible Spider-Men. I’m not sure how I feel about that coming convergence—a post-credits button brings Moribus too close to the glaring light of everything else—but I would, much to my shock, head back into the murk with the doctor and friends again.

"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto), the title character of Columbia Pictures’ MCU-adjacent semi-horror movie “Morbius,” is a “living vampire.” What, you might be thinking, does that mean? Did the good doctor become a vampire without having to die first? Why, yes—he fused his DNA with vampire bat DNA in an attempt to cure the rare, fatal blood disease that’s been plaguing him since childhood. (What disease, you ask? You sweet, innocent child.) The fusion gave him super speed, super strength, echolocation abilities, and an appetite for blood that’s only partially sated by the artificial substitute for which Morbius rejects a Nobel Prize at the beginning of the film. (Why? Again, you’re asking too many questions.) In short, he’s a science vampire. (So, like if Batman was a doctor, then? Wrong universe, but close.) So that means the usual rules of vampirism don’t apply, right? Yes and no. Loxias Crown (Matt Smith) Morbius’ best friend turned greatest adversary, does turn himself into a vampire using Morbius’ formula. But we don’t know if he died in the process. That sequence is left off screen, for reasons presumably tied to the many reshoots and delays that hampered “Morbius” on its journey to the big screen. And other characters die and come back to life after tasting Morbius’ blood, a supernatural transformation that doesn’t involve—as Morbius himself puts it at one point—""science stuff"" at all. In short, the nature of Morbius’ affliction is messy and contradictory and not worth thinking about for more than a few seconds, a quality that extends throughout Daniel Espinosa’s misbegotten superhero/horror hybrid. All the greatest metaphorical hits are present in Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless’ script, as well as in Leto’s performance: Vampirism as illness? Check. Vampirism as addiction? Yup. Don’t ask for much in terms of actually developing these themes, however, as the film’s approach is to point and yell, “look over there!” whenever things get complicated. A superhero whose murders are the direct result of his attempts to help people presents a complex moral dilemma. But you wouldn’t know it from this film, which takes any intriguing elements of its title character’s story and flattens them into clichéd grandstanding about the obligation of the privileged few to protect the unsuspecting many. From there, Morbius—who, as you may have already guessed, was turned into a “living vampire” during the experiment—is ostensibly under investigation by the FBI. But Agents Rodriguez (Al Madrigal) and Stroud (Tyrese Gibson) do a terrible job tracking him, given that he returns to his lab with his colleague and love interest Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) within hours of the crime. This is a front-page story with an escalating body count, and the prime suspect is wandering around unnoticed by doing little more than putting up the hood on his sweatshirt. But no matter. On to a more important question: Is the vampire stuff cool?  Sadly, not really. Like most superhero movies, “Morbius'' is rated PG-13, which limits the blood to the sanguine juice boxes Morbius chugs throughout and the occasional rusty stain across a character’s throat. And although prosthetic artists are listed in the film's credits, their contributions are difficult to make out amid the heavy-handed CGI. “Morbius” is not an MCU film: It belongs to the so-called “Spider-Verse,” coming from the same studio as “Spider-Man: No Way Home.” But it shares an Achilles’ heel with the MCU, in the sense that you can’t tell what’s going on in any of the film’s action sequences.  If it’s not the wavy, sketchy CGI trails that follow in Morbius’ wake—picture a combination of psychedelic tracers and the soot creatures from “My Neighbor Totoro”—cluttering up the screen, it’s those damn bats. Earlier action sequences aren’t much better, to be clear. But it’s almost impossible to follow the film’s climactic battle, thanks to a colony of vampire bats that swoop in at the last minute to help Morbius clean up the bloodthirsty mess he’s made. Espinosa seems to know that it’s difficult to make out what’s happening, pausing for a midair slow-motion shot in nearly every action sequence. The problem there is, lingering on these moments reveals how obviously phony they are.  But the film’s over-reliance on digital effects isn’t terribly surprising in a modern superhero movie. Neither is Smith’s sympathetic-to-a-point villain. Nor, for that matter, is Leto’s bland hero, whose most distinctive aspect is the demanding physical transformation the actor underwent for the role. No, the only really surprising—and, therefore, the most disappointing—thing about “Morbius” is the fact that it’s an honest-to-goodness horror film. But only for a few seconds. Midway through the film, a nurse walks alone down the creepy, abandoned hallway of a hospital late at night, triggering a series of motion-activated sensors as she goes. Suddenly, a light flashes further down the hall, drawing the eye to the point where it disappears into the horizon. A shape! The nurse spots the intruder and runs, bulbs flashing as she goes. She stops to catch her breath, and a monstrous hand pops up from the bottom of the screen. She screams. The camera pulls back, lingering as each isolated puddle of illumination blinks out until only the woman’s prone body—and the shadowy form hunched over her—can be seen. Finally, that light goes out as well, bathing the screen in darkness.  Enjoy the gasp as it escapes from your throat, dear viewer. Because you’re not going to get another one, at least not from this movie. Better luck next time with the actual undead, we suppose.

"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," After massive delays, Morbius is finally hitting theaters. But the long wait and coupled with the massive success of Spider-Man: No Way Home has crushed pretty much any (if there was some) enthusiasm for the film. Set in Sony’s Spider-Man villain universe that is being crafted without the web-slinger, Morbius picks up the PG-13 darkness torch that Venom carried but lacks the charming and entertaining protagonist that has turned that franchise into a cult classic. Morbius is directed by Daniel Espinosa, written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, and stars Jared Leto as the titular character with Adria Arjona, Matt Smith, Tyrese Gibson, Al Madrigal, and Jared Harris. In Morbius, Jared Leto transforms into the “enigmatic antihero” Michael Morbius. Dangerously ill with a rare blood disorder that is killing him and his best friend, Michael is determined to save others suffering the same fate. Having lived longer than what was anticipated and living with an anvil over his head, he attempts a desperate gamble to use the anticoagulants in vampire bat DNA with human DNA. While at first, it seems to be a radical success, it quickly becomes clear that there is a monster driven by blood inside of him, the living vampire. Much like Venom before it, Morbius is adapting a darker character and meets him with a darker tone. However, it’s frozen by its PG-13 rating. The blood on display is dark, almost black, done to get away from ratings I’m sure, and even the word blood has been switched with “the red” for some reason. While the tone of the film is broody and dark, both in content and lighting, Morbius approaches a line and continually jumps away from it. Pulling its punches is understandable, and an issue other Sony ventures have had (I mean, where was the carnage with Carnage) but Morbius lacks a scene-stealing star to keep you bought in. Instead, we get Jared Leto who is supposed to be playing an “enigmatic anti-hero.” Instead, there is no mystery around him, and other than a sadness that sure listens to the Black Parade, there are no characteristics that mark his character as the Morbius we know. Additionally, there is no antihero in this take on the living vampire. Instead, his motivations are straightforward, cure this blood disorder at all costs to save people – but the only cost is just himself and some rats. Beyond that, he is never once pulled over to the strength he has from “the red” and instead is deadset on sacrificing himself to save people from the film’s antagonist. He’s really just a hero, no wiggle room there outside some miscommunication with law enforcement. Working in its favor, the film seems to avoid much of the “disability is bad always” tropes that audiences were worried about and instead examines the scientific pursuit to cure a deadly disease and contextualizes the “cure” as a failure. However, the film doesn’t understand the message it’s throwing behind the scientific search. On the one hand, Michael is something different now and despite the blood lust and danger, the film’s antagonist wants Michael to accept it and embrace the power. On the other, the living vampire has regrets about playing god and seems to resign himself to end it all in an acceptance that science is sometimes better left untouched. The fact that both these threads exist isn’t inherently bad and can be fruitful ground to discuss biomedical ethics and god complexes. But the film doesn’t do anything with these ideas, instead, it leaves everything without resolution, as if a portion of the story was removed for time – even in an almost two-hour movie. But presenting interesting ideas and then abandoning them is the name of the game for this film. There is a good film somewhere in all of Morbius’ mess. For the first act of the film, choices are made that investigate Michael’s newfound powers from a pure scientific curiosity and that’s done extremely well. Additionally, the ethical questions of medicine and the action sequences balance each other out in a way that really works. However, once the film’s antagonist hits his stride, everything is out the window. Science takes a back seat, Michael becomes more focused on the drama between him and his former friend than any implications for the entire world, and the action sequences deteriorate. While the use of the smokey ripples around the bodies of the fast-moving characters during their fights is done well in parts, the climactic battle becomes muddied and almost impossible to process. Flying CGI industrial parts and some smokey swirls of purple are all you really see. For what it’s worth though, Matt Smith’s Milo really does hit his chaotic part on the head. He’s arrogant and self-centered and his joy when inflicting violence is extremely well-acted. From his physicality to his voice, Smith’s Milo swallows up Leto’s Michael Morbius in every scene they’re in together. Even if Leto didn’t understand the assignment (which at this point I don’t think anyone told him what was going to be on it), Smith does. Suffering from the same problems of trying to be dark and violent but still all-ages that Venom did, Morbius lacks the staying power and charm of its predecessor due in large part to its lead. There are parts I really liked about the film, primarily in its first act, but it’s not something I can recommend you spend money on. A night in on a streaming service sure, but going to the theater with inflated prices in a pandemic? Most definitely not.

"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," No one wants to watch a lousy movie, but an unmitigated disaster can often be more interesting than something that’s just mediocre. Morbius falls into the latter category, a run-of-the-mill origin story that’s capably acted and professionally mounted, but mostly lifeless up on screen—and feels more disappointing after two years of anticipation for its release. Jared Leto delivers an adequately creepy and conflicted take on the eponymous scientist opposite a scenery-chewing Matt Smith as his surrogate brother and sometime adversary, while director Daniel Espinoza (Life) stages the action like his latest project is cosplaying as a series of classic horror movies. The result is a bland, competent, and safe superhero adventure that seems destined to be forgotten before its end credits finish rolling. Leto (House Of Gucci) plays Dr. Michael Morbius, a scientist who devoted his life and career to curing rare blood diseases after contracting one as a child. Bankrolled by his surrogate brother Lucien (Smith), a rich orphan who was alternately raised and monitored by their shared physician Nicholas (Jared Harris), Morbius takes increasingly risky and ethically questionable chances to alleviate the fatigue and physical disability from which they both suffer. After harvesting the organs of vampire bats in the search for a crucial anti-coagulant, Morbius administers an experimental treatment to himself that restores his health and strength—but not before he succumbs to an inexplicable bloodlust and murders the team of mercenaries shepherding his laboratory through international waters. When his lab partner Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) is injured during the excursion, Morbius summons the authorities on her behalf and flees the scene before being apprehended. But while he tries to figure out what to do about his newfound condition, Lucien contacts Morbius and demands  his own dosage of the treatment. As two detectives close in on Morbius, seeking answers about his role in  a gruesome string of deaths, he races to create a cure for this  insatiable appetite. Before long, Morbius finds himself at odds not only with the cops, but with Lucien after his former friend embraces becoming a bloodthirsty, superhuman monster. That makes Morbius more determined than ever to find a cure for the violent and all-consuming affliction from which both he and Lucien suffer, while recognizing that doing so may cost both of them their lives.  Working from a script by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, whose first credit was on Luke Evans’ 2014 vampire film Dracula Untold, Espinoza shuffles through a familiar series of bloodsucker clichés that are frequently joked about but are otherwise reduced to the symptoms of a superhero’s curse, à la the Hulk. It’s hard to remember the last film that treated these fictional creatures with any real dignity. This one is all too happy to exploit their violent and dangerous impulses for set pieces, then undercut the more interesting elements of addiction or biological need to let Morbius, Lucien, and his costars prattle on in  increasingly tedious, expository exchanges. Essentially, when it isn’t standing on the shoulders of genre giants to elicit scary moments, Morbius wants to be the Batman Begins of Sony’s supervillain franchise, and it’s unafraid to borrow liberally from its predecessors to evoke the same atmosphere or tone. Morbius’ first attack on the mercenaries, for example, unfolds like he’s the xenomorph in a better-lit, earthbound version of the Nostromo and/or LV-426, decimating space truckers and automatic-weapon-wielding Marines with swift brutality. A later fight between Morbius and Lucien, meanwhile, conjures the tube chase from An American Werewolf In London, but with less style and more computer-generated imagery. One supposes there are only so many locations that filmmakers can use for action scenes that haven’t already been shot in some iconic fashion, but it takes little imagination to make those cinematic connections while they’re happening. Moreover, Jon Ekstrand’s score functions in precisely the kind of same-y, nondescript way that so much film and TV music seems to these days. The few moments that stand out do so because they sound so similar to Hans Zimmer’s wall-of-sound work on Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy, especially when they’re accompanying a scene where, say, a man is looking skyward as a swarm of bats flutter around him in obedience.  While close-ups of Jared Leto’s vibrating ears feel unnecessary, the effect of Morbius’ “radar” as he scans his environment—from his elegantly appointed laboratory to the entirety of Manhattan—actually offers a neat visual, as the buildings dissolve beneath expanding waves of mist. But endlessly transforming faces and colored trails that trace these monsters’ progression across a cityscape quickly grow repetitive, and by the time Morbius and Lucien are hammering each other from one rubble pile to the next, the action becomes an empty placeholder for the hero’s resolution that Espinoza telegraphs. His instincts to try for something semi-tragic, even operatic are admirable, and occasionally work when he slows things down to create a single, tableau-like moment, but the rest of the time the movie ebbs and flows without excitement between dopey character motivations and reams of technical jargon about blood. If he’s not quite winging it like Tom Hardy is in the Venom franchise, Leto thankfully doesn’t seem to take himself too seriously to prevent a little bit of fun from creeping into the film. But his character’s journey is too obvious, predictable, and oddly impatient to get to its resolution for audiences to care much about whether or not he becomes a superhero or succumbs to his disease. Especially since there’s no particular inclination for Morbius to help ordinary people without the enormous financial resources of Lucien, it’s hard to imagine him doing much of anything for anybody after  acquiring his powers and apparently learning how to control them. Smith, on the other hand, seems to relish his chance to turn heel opposite Leto, but he also seems to be well aware that however viewers receive his performance as the film’s bloodsucking super-baddie, his face will be covered more often than not with wildly uneven computer-generated effects. Without spoiling anything, a couple of post-credits sequences set up a future for Leto’s character in a larger world that you understand why Sony would try and telegraph, but given the failures of past Spider-Man spin-offs (particularly those from the Amazing films) it’s hard to believe they have really thought any of those next steps through. But until then, Morbius feels like exactly the kind of second-tier superhero adventure audiences will accept in between ones that they actively want. Admittedly, it’s odd to want a movie like this to have been worse, but that would mean it failed as bigly as the swings it took; by comparison, Morbius is a walk, or at best a bunt. That may qualify it as a hit for Leto, Espinoza, and Sony, but that doesn’t mean it’s much fun to watch from the stands."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," Spider-Man: No Way Home opened up the multiverse and introduced the vast potential for crossovers and introductions to Spider-Man’s more horror-based rogues. It makes sense that Morbius comes hot on No Way Home‘s heels, and well ahead of the new Blade. The living vampire’s comic origins as an adversary to Spider-Man and Blade expands the cinematic web further but introducing the character in a standalone feature to general audiences means skipping ahead straight to his antihero persona. It results in a standard origin story meant to acclimate audiences quickly, but it’s also devoid of much life or personality. Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) is a brilliant doctor determined to find a cure for the rare blood disease that’s afflicted him and his surrogate brother Lucien (Matt Smith) since childhood. With the help of fellow doctor Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), at least in keeping his work honest, Dr. Morbius experiments with the anti-coagulation in vampire bats. His tests cause him to inadvertently transform, granting him superpowers and a need to feed on blood. The script by Burk Sharpless and Matt Sazama includes a few wry winks that hint at an intended sense of humor. Morbius transforms into the living vampire aboard the Murnau in international waters. The Murnau, of course, being a nod to Nosferatu director F.W. Murnau. The scene draws cheeky parallels to Dracula’s famous voyage across the sea on the Demeter, from Bram Stoker’s classic novel. Beyond that, though, Michael’s origin story gets stripped to its core basics and falls into a more familiar formula. The actors become tasked with communicating the deadpan humor and very rarely do they nail the delivery to make the jokes land. Only Al Madrigal, as an agent tracking Morbius, consistently succeeds in being funny. Leto takes himself too seriously, for the most part, for the dry one-liners to hit their mark. On the opposite end, Smith pushes his character too far into caricature. Director Daniel Espinosa (Life) attempts to inject style into Michael’s constant discovery of emerging powers and his battle with the film’s big bad. Still, the brisk run-through of by-the-numbers narrative beats means no time to let the character relationships organically develop. Leto and Arjona lack chemistry and their superficially rendered characters don’t give them much to grab onto either. It makes it challenging to invest in their rushed romance. That applies to Michael’s relationship with his brother, too, which is a much bigger issue considering the film’s emphasis on brotherhood. It’s hard to invest in any of these characters. The movie spends so much time on Morbius trying to control his bloodlust and run damage control on a deadly threat, firmly setting him as more of a hero type than a foe or even an antihero. It makes for a somewhat confusing final few moments for the character and an even more confusing duo of mid-credit scenes. Those scenes offer more personality than anything that preceded, but they also directly contradict the character we just met. It’s as if the precedence is with the bigger picture than the smaller, standalone components. In an oversaturated space of superhero cinema, Morbius sits smack in the middle. It’s not terrible, but it’s not memorable either. Leto mistakes a lack of emotion for stoicism, and it’s up to the VFX to do the heavy lifting to imbue the living vampire with any identity or temperament. Without, say, someone like Tom Hardy embracing the weirdness of the character in Venom, it’s tough to find rooting interest or muster any excitement for the vampiric bat man. At best, it’s a serviceable placeholder until the next installment of this expanding universe. Horror journalist, RT Top Critic, and Critics Choice Association member. Co-Host of the Bloody Disgusting Podcast. Has appeared on PBS series' Monstrum, served on the SXSW Midnighter shorts jury, and moderated horror panels for WonderCon and SeriesFest. Officially announced by Blumhouse and Lionsgate earlier this month, a reboot of The Blair Witch Project is currently in the works, which will be the third follow-up to the original found footage horror classic that changed the game back in 1999. In the wake of the announcement, the original creators and stars have each issued joint statements this weekend. The Blair Witch Project was created by filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez – along with Haxan Films creative partners Gregg Hale, Robin Cowie and Michael Monello – back in the 1990s, with stars Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams, and Joshua Leonard heading out into the woods of Maryland to conjure up horror magic together. The actors largely improvised their performances and even used their real names in the movie, with the film’s clever viral marketing campaign leading many to believe that they weren’t actually actors in a movie, but rather real people who truly went missing out in the woods. All this to say, Donahue, Williams and Leonard are collectively a huge part of why The Blair Witch Project became a pop culture phenomenon, and all these years later they’re looking for some recognition from Lionsgate, the current rights holders of the iconic property. As Joshua Leonard first explained in a Facebook post on April 11, “I’m so proud of our little punk-rock movie, and I LOVE the fans who keep the flames burning. But at this point, it’s 25 years of disrespect from the folks who’ve pocketed the lion’s share (pun intended) of the profits from OUR work, and that feels both icky and classless.” 1. Retroactive + future residual payments to Heather, Michael and Josh for acting services rendered in the original BWP, equivalent to the sum that would’ve been allotted through SAG-AFTRA, had we had proper union or legal representation when the film was made. 2. Meaningful consultation on any future Blair Witch reboot, sequel, prequel, toy, game, ride, escape room, etc… , in which one could reasonably assume that Heather, Michael & Josh’s names and/or likenesses will be associated for promotional purposes in the public sphere. Note: Our film has now been rebooted twice, both times were a disappointment from a fan/box office/critical perspective. Neither of these films were made with significant creative input from the original team. As the insiders who created the Blair Witch and have been listening to what fans love & want for 25 years, we’re your single greatest, yet thus-far unutilized secret-weapon! 3. “The Blair Witch Grant”: A 60k grant (the budget of our original movie), paid out yearly by Lionsgate, to an unknown/aspiring genre filmmaker to assist in making their first feature film. This is a GRANT, not a development fund, hence Lionsgate will not own any of the underlying rights to the project. “As we near the 25th anniversary of The Blair Witch Project, our pride in the storyworld we created and the film we produced is reaffirmed by the recent announcement of a reboot by horror icons Jason Blum and James Wan. “While we, the original filmmakers, respect Lionsgate’s right to monetize the intellectual property as it sees fit, we must highlight the significant contributions of the original cast — Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Mike Williams. As the literal faces of what has become a franchise, their likenesses, voices, and real names are inseparably tied to The Blair Witch Project. Their unique contributions not only defined the film’s authenticity but continue to resonate with audiences around the world. If you’d like to support the cause, sharing and amplifying is the way to go. You’ll find the original post for Heather, Michael and Josh’s statement below, which can be shared to your feed."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," Somewhere in the middle of Morbius, a film about a Spider-Man villain that does not feature Spider-Man, I was ready to tap out. To get up and leave. To move to an alpine cottage in Switzerland and simply never engage with Sony’s Spider-Man-less Spider-Man Universe ever again. It’s too much effort, with too little reward. There’s no reason all of this should be so complicated. Morbius, in the comics, makes for a fine adversary. Even the film’s given origin story could have neatly fit into the sidelines of a Spider-Man outing: Michael Morbius (Jared Leto), the inventor of artificial blood and a man so humble he turned down the Nobel Peace Prize, lives with a condition that requires three blood transfusions a day to survive. A fear of his own mortality corrupts him, so he flies to Costa Rica to seek out a rare type of blood-sucking bat (what’s scarier than a vampire? A vampire with colonialist ambitions). He mixes its DNA into human blood and – bada boom – he’s now Nosferatu for the Hot Topic generation. Morbius looks like Jared Leto with extra highlight shimmer. He can fly by riding air flows, leaves trails of smoke behind him, and has wiggly ears capable of echolocation. Sometimes he wears a kagoul. It’s all pretty straightforward. Sony, because of its deal with Disney’s Marvel Studios, has loaned out Spider-Man for the foreseeable future. But apparently unable to simply sit on its piles of cash and enjoy the view, the studio has forged ahead with its own franchise, one which continuously implies the existence of Spider-Man without confirming which of the three existing Spider-Men – Holland, Garfield, Maguire – we’re talking about. Morbius follows two Venom films, and there is a single, oblique reference to that character in this one. It will be followed by Kraven the Hunter. Who knows how he fits in. At least Sony had enough faith in director Andy Serkis to trust him with last year’s sequel Venom: Let There Be Carnage. There was a voice there. A little bit of originality in its central romcom conceit. Morbius, from top to bottom, is a work of shameless corporate desperation. It can’t be described as the wild, untethered disaster that some were secretly hoping for, either, because that would imply some level of creative risk. No, this is the flavourless product of far too many board meetings, where anything offered by director Daniel Espinosa has been whittled down to the level of pure “content”. I’m not sure it’s even meant to function as a film in the traditional sense. It’s more a two-hour prelude to a post-credit scene, which happens to be one of the most sloppily written teases ever committed to screen. Morbius also doesn’t have an ending. It simply cuts to the credits when everyone’s had enough. Elsewhere, Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless’s script largely submits to Leto’s overwhelming desire to act. He yells. He throws things. He contorts his body. It’s expression without any real character, nor the fallback of a quirky Italian accent à la House of Gucci. Morbius learns to control his powers without much effort, so the majority of the film is dedicated to Leto monologuing about how he can only be sustained by artificial blood for so long. Eventually, he’ll have to start sipping on the red stuff. Around the film’s midpoint, it also lets Matt Smith, playing Morbius’s BFF Milo, do some acting, too. An entire superhero vehicle is reduced to two guys ineffectively trying to convince us that they did this for the art and not for the money. In Espinosa’s defence, there are ghostly traces here of a film with horror ambitions. We see blood splattered across glass windows, lights flickering in a hospital corridor, and grimly lit nightclubs. There’s violence, but only ever implied – lost somewhere in all the chaotic editing, which seems so unsure about what a vampire in battle should look like that it simply fudges every action scene into an indescribable blur. It’s humourless in places where it should be goofy, if only to acknowledge how much Morbius’s wrinkly, snarly vampire face makes him look like he’s about to be staked by Buffy. But, conversely, it also drops humour into all the wrong places – “You don’t want to see me when I’m hungry,” Morbius says during a police interrogation, to zero applause. All in all, Morbius is a film that’s more frustrating than it is gleefully inept. And if superhero movies really are going to dominate modern cinema for the next decade or so, we should at least be allowed a little healthy competition between studios. I hope, in the future, Sony can put up a better fight than this."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL,Morbius is surprisingly an okay film with Jared Leto delivering a somber performance as the vampiric antihero.
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," When Jared Leto makes his first appearance in Morbius wearing a black, bat-like cape that looks like he bought off the discount rack at a Spirit Halloween store, you know that this film isn’t exactly going to be one for subtlety. That isn’t necessarily the kiss of death for Morbius, as Superhero films have a reputation for hammering their message home like a railroad spike, and we’re usually okay with it. What sucks the life out of Morbius is a trifecta of failures. The first is Jared Leto’s performance, somehow wooden and annoyingly over-the-top at the same time. The second is the uninspired series of action sequences, which would have looked dated if they had gone toe-to-toe against The Matrix in 1999. And the third is a complete lack of anything approaching a real human character. These issues and many more make a solid case that Morbius isn’t just bad — It’s irredeemable. Michael Morbius (Leto) is a brilliant young doctor whose invention of artificial blood has saved lives around the world. However, he’s running out of time to save himself, having suffered from a blood disease since birth that requires dialysis multiple times a day. All of his research is dedicated to finding a cure not just for himself but also for the many others who suffer from the same ailment, including his childhood best friend Lucien, aka Milo (Matt Smith).  He finds a promising lead in certain coagulants found in vampire bats and theorizes that if he can somehow fuse human and bat DNA together, the blood disease will be neutralized (If you have any background in science or, hell, even a used 6th-grade biology textbook sitting around in your childhood bedroom, you will likely find this hypothesis particularly galling). Predictably, this doesn’t go as planned. Although Michael indeed finds a way to rid himself of his disease’s painful and debilitating effects, it comes at a terrible cost: He needs to drink blood more and more frequently until it becomes an overwhelming ache that consumes his every waking thought. On its face, Leto seems like a perfectly acceptable choice to take on this role. He has a certain trademark intensity that would seem fitting for a superpowered vampire desperately trying to control his darker urges. But whether it’s his performance or simply the way the role is written, there’s nothing there – no charisma, no life, no humor. We know he’s a generally upright kind of person based on his desire to help people and the lengths he goes to prevent himself from hurting anyone. But for the most part, it’s like staring into a pure void. He is not particularly well supported by his fellow cast members, either. There’s a version of this film where Matt Smith as Lucien would be a great counterpart to Morbius – he’s a much more interesting actor than many give him credit for and has a quiet menace and charm that can be extremely engaging under the right circumstances. Alas, he’s wasted here. The character of Lucien is poorly written, and Smith’s efforts to imbue him with life end up with him going entirely off the rails, gnawing on any bits of scenery he can find. Adria Arjona as Martine Bancroft, Morbius’ dedicated fellow doctor, doesn’t fare much better. In a true step backward for superhero love interests everywhere, there is absolutely nothing to her character other than a pure devotion to Morbius. Oh, and she’s smart. That’s it. It’s hardly Arjona’s fault that the character she’s asked to portray is paper-thin, but it makes her yet another weak component of the film. But who cares about characters? People are going to see a superhero movie for the action, anyway, right? Well, Morbius is a letdown there, too. Despite this film’s bloated budget, there are extended fight sequences that look no better than a video game. Even worse is how the film feels bold enough to slow down the action, as though to show off a particularly cool move, which only exposes how shoddily put-together the conflict is. There’s no choreography, just a bland CG mess adding nothing to the production. Look, with the amount of superhero content released every year, it stands to reason that not all of them will be winners. But when you watch Morbius, there’s an inescapable sense that someone had to be actively trying to make a movie this bad. It fails on almost every conceivable front, making even its comparatively short run time of under two hours (rarer and rarer for a comic book movie these days) feel like an eternity. The young versions of Morbius and Lucien, who have about four minutes of screentime, are good, and the always dependable Jared Harris is a brief shining light in the darkness. But that’s it. And that’s not nearly enough to save Morbius from the disastrous fate of becoming one of the worst movies in recent memory."

The Spider-Verse was already growing unwieldy long before the concept of the multiverse was so forcefully (and, to be clear, cleverly) injected into the adventures of Peter Parker (and Peter Parker and Peter Parker) in “Spider-Man: No Way Home” (a Sony film). Before that, it was bandied about in the wider Marvel Cinematic Universe (a Disney franchise), hinted at in “Into the Spider-Verse” (Sony), nodded to in the “Venom” films (Sony), and mined for still more material in the various Marvel television series (again, Disney). It’s enough to make anyone’s head spin, and that’s even with the generous help of the internet itself, rife with Wikipedia pages and explainers and timelines galore. Now the Spider-Verse again expands, thanks to Sony’s long-delayed “Morbius,” ostensibly a Spidey spin-off set in a universe where (for now at least, and one of the few things that seems clear in a film muddled by a series of baffling choices and unkind edits) Spider-Man doesn’t exist, but human-created vampirism does. Sure! DC may have long ago laid claim to the concept of a bat/man, but Marvel — not an institution to shy away from putting their own spin on comic book ideas — has spent decades building its own man/bat, this one a villain (maybe?) who leans into the bloodier side of associating with literal bloodsuckers. Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) has plenty going for him — a journey to the character’s Wikipedia page is a joy in itself, billing the Marvel baddie as “Morbius, aka the Living Vampire, aka Dr. Michael Morbius, Ph.D., M.D.” — but you’ll forgive him for being obsessed with the one thing his big brain can’t cure: a rare blood disease that’s been slowly killing him his entire life. When we first meet Dr. Morbius — and, just to be clear, one of the first things we hear him say is, “I am a doctor,” thank you for that — he’s somewhere in Costa Rica, attempting to capture a pack of vampire bats. Is this an idea that has ever worked out for anybody? Flashback: child Michael (Charlie Shotwell), tucked up in some fancy clinic in Greece, lives out his days either a) hobbling around the joint on braces or b) getting blood transfusions to keep him alive. He’s grown accustomed to losing people, so when a new pal is put in the bed next to him, he can barely even acknowledge the kid’s name (Lucien), instead opting to call him “Milo,” just like the first kid who died next to him, just like he’s called every other potential friend who entered (and exited) his life. Daniel Espinosa’s film moves reasonably fast in its opening moments, and while we may never learn much more about Michael (like, does he have parents?), “Morbius” at least makes an early claim to what ails the youngster and what’s clearly going to impact the rest of his life. (And, yes, it is somewhat refreshing to meet a batty super-dude who isn’t entirely driven by his pain over his dead family.) A tech whiz to boot, when kindly Dr. Emil Nikols (Jared Harris), his sole caretaker, offers to get him admittance to a school for gifted children in New York, Michael goes for it, even if it means leaving his newest pal behind. He’s got big plans, like curing the disease that has afflicted both of them, and while this is hardly an original idea, it’s one that makes sense. That clarity will soon dissipate, but screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless have to be commended for even briefly injecting anything grounded into what becomes a weirder story by the minute. Twenty-five years later, Michael is a genius doctor (financed by the very rich adult Milo, now played by Matt Smith, who somehow still goes by “Milo“) who has spent his career attempting to cure vicious blood diseases. There have been some strides, like his invention of fake blood — which we’re soon told has cured more people than penicillin — but while the world has wanted to fete Michael for this gift, he’s reacted by doing bonkers stuff, like rejecting a Nobel Prize. Worse, he’s still miles away from solving his own personal puzzle. Maybe, he hopes, blood-sucking bats can help him. His alluring professional partner, Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), is certainly game to try! This sounds dark and gritty, and Oliver Wood’s murky cinematography and Jon Ekstrand’s “Dark Knight” lite score sure seem to want viewers to associate it with other, much better bat-adjacent joints, but the film is too disjointed to feel much like, well, anything. Mostly, the film occupies a strange no-mans-land of the sprawling Spider-Verse, not charming like the “Spider-Man” films, not funny like the “Venom” films, and certainly not technically impressive like the animated “Into the Spider-Verse.” Even the most basic elements of the film are incomprehensible. Michael has all the trappings of a bad guy — this is the kind of guy who has a massive chamber of bats in the middle of his lab, both for decor and research — but by the time he gifts yet another origami animal to someone he cares about, you’ll have to wonder, this dude is a villain? (Leto, who notoriously immerses himself in his work, could seemingly find little here, his Michael is somehow both confounding and very boring. ) Even after he injects himself with bat blood serum and murders a literal boat full of people, the extent of his powers remain a mystery. Something about really good hearing? It should come as little surprise then that the film’s scattered action sequences are just as confused, mostly relying on characters falling from tall heights, smashing into things, and unfurling more streaks of powdered color than a gender reveal party (does this not make sense to you? good, it doesn’t make sense in the context of the film either). Espinosa has directed some great actioners over the years, from “Snabba Cash” to “Safe House,” but not of that skill is on display here. Elsewhere, the CGI that transforms Leto into an uneasy bloodsucker is ugly and unappealing. The film’s timeline is hazy, basic common sense never enters the picture, and a villain arrives on the scene because somehow “Morbius” needs to move forward. Most of the film feels unforgivably chopped up, as if key scenes were snipped at random, an inscrutable introduction to a character who probably could have stayed safely hidden in the shadows. There are moments of perhaps accidental levity, like the chyron that pops up to explain we’re in “international waters” after Michael has announced that they can only conduct an early experiment in…international waters (what, did the sea not give it away?) or Leto’s straight-faced assertion that the bats “welcome him like a brother.” That amusement runs dry, however, and “Morbius” mostly surprises because of how very dull it is. (How do you make a Jared Leto vampire superhero movie dull? In this economy?) Case in point: After Michael’s bad deeds become publicized, local news teams term him “the Vampire Murderer,” an uninspired nickname that serves as a microcosm of everything “Morbius” is: mostly unnecessary, oddly unoriginal, and soon quite forgettable indeed.

"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," In “Morbius,” Jared Leto sports his signature beard and long silky black hair parted down the middle, though for a good stretch he doesn’t give off his usual Jesus of Beverly Hills glow. That’s because he plays the sickly Dr. Michael Morbius, who is cadaverous and sunken-eyed, hobbling around on a pair of forearm crutches. Morbius, a science wizard, has spent his life trying to come up with a cure for his mysterious ailment; along the way, he invented artificial blood. But now he’s going for broke. In the film’s opening sequence, he emerges from a helicopter in the mountains of Costa Rica and enters a cave to capture a gigantic flock of vampire bats, whose DNA he plans to extract to create a powerful new serum, which he’ll inject into his own mottled veins. It’s an experiment at once bold and beyond the pale, in direct violation of medical ethics, which is why he conducts it on a cargo ship off the coast of Long Island, with eight mercenaries in tow. It is also, of course, an experiment destined to go very, very wrong. In Marvel movies like the ones featuring the origin stories of the Hulk or Captain America, these kinds of experiments tend to blow up in spectacular, mind-and-body-bending ways. But in “Morbius,” there’s not much ado about what happens to Michael Morbius. Working with his loyal assistant, Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), he injects the serum and instantly morphs into a thirsty kinetic vampire, his skin stretched over his cheekbones, his teeth a gallows row of pointy incisors, his pupils scrambled like Jackson Pollock pinpoints. Even if you’re not familiar with the “Morbius” comics, which first appeared in 1971, we’ve seen monsters like this one many times before ­— in “The Reptile” (1966) and old Tobe Hooper films, and in movies I can hardly think to name because the whole feral chompy look and gnashing vibe of Morbius the vampire supervillain and brooding antihero, while true to the comics, has a generic demon flavor to it. The entire movie, directed by Daniel Espinosa from a script by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, is generic — naggingly, almost jarringly so. You watch it and think, “This is what now passes for a new Marvel chapter?” Technically, “Morbius” is the third entry in the Spider-Man Universe, after “Venom” and “Venom 2: Let There Be Carnage”  — you know, the movies that that were designed to reignite the comic-book spirit at Sony Pictures after the two plodding Andrew Garfield “Spider-Man” installments. And just as the executives at Sony seemed to unleash those earlier films upon the world without the kind of creative oversight that might have enlivened them, “Morbius” is a movie in which it’s clear that no one ever sent the script back for a rewrite with the instructions, “Please add a script.” As in: Add spice, add dialogue, add something so that the movie plays like more than a barely colored-in diagram. “Morbius” isn’t even a debacle. It’s a little over 90 minutes long if you don’t count the credits (which include what has to be the worst closing teaser I’ve ever seen in a Marvel movie — it ends with the word “Intriguing,” dangled as if Vincent Price had uttered it), and for all the overwrought push of Jon Ekstrand’s score, the film is nothing more than a flimsy time-killer, an early-April placeholder of a movie. It’s as trashy and underimagined as the “Venom” films, though it’s easy to see why both of those became mega-hits: The character of Venom, who’s like a superhero merged with the creature from “Alien,” with a voice of basso showbiz effrontery, is an entertaining hunk of sci-fi demon eye candy. Whereas Leto’s teeth-baring monster-scientist truly looks like a relic from the ’70s. He never scares or dazzles or haunts you — not because Leto is less than a good actor, but because this isn’t a character based on acting. It’s based on the creakiest FX, the one (mild) exception being the painterly trails of digital “smoke” left behind by Morbius as he flies through the air. At first, Morbius has no control over himself. He makes mincemeat of the mercenaries, which brings a couple of cops, the earnest Stroud (Tyrese Gibson) and the cutup Rodriguez (Al Madrigal), onto his tail. Are they investigating a criminal mystery? Not really. A mystery requires at least two moving parts. But Morbius, though he now needs blood to sustain him, doesn’t want to be a killer; that’s his torment. For a while, the packets of artificial blood that hang in his laboratory freezer work just fine. Leto will grab and drain one like a desperate alcoholic in a ’40s movie downing a pint of whiskey. But the effect of the artificial blood starts to wane. First it works for six hours, then for four hours and 22 minutes. What will happen when it stops working? Before he has to worry about that, Morbius must deal with Milo (Matt Smith), his sickly British boyhood chum from a sanitarium in Greece, which was overseen by the kindly Emil Nikols (Jared Harris). The once-mild Milo, after too much bullying, has grown up into a bitter martini-swilling aristocratic shut-in. Unlike Morbius, he has no compunction about not only taking the serum — which he does behind Morbius’ back — but giving into his newly enhanced virile bloodsucker self. Matt Smith, from “Doctor Who” and “The Crown,” gives Milo a toxic magnetism. There’s a sequence that begins promisingly, with Milo dressing and strutting in front of the mirror then heading to a bar, where he suddenly feels like a superman. The movie needed more of this (and juicier writing even in that bar scene). Matt blasts in and out of demon face at will, and his embrace of a newly empowered state is, frankly, more fun than Jared Leto’s pensive guilt about it. These two rise in tandem, then face off, and that’s more or less the entire movie. The character of Morbius is being set up as one of Spider-Man’s antagonists, which the film establishes with a late-in-the-game appearance by Michael Keaton’s Adrian Toomes. Of course, this isn’t Leto’s first fling with comic-book villainy, but his Joker, in “Suicide Squad,” displayed the actor’s talent as well as his genuine attraction to preening dark-side souls. “Morbius” is more like a paycheck movie: time for Leto to punch the clock and get on the comic-book train. But this reluctant vampire has so little flavor that he’s closer to the invisible man."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," In the future,  every Marvel comics character will have their own movie for 15 minutes. Right now, the spinning intellectual property wheel has stopped on Dr. Michael Morbius — prize-winning scientist, terminally ill patient, Type O connoisseur. Initially introduced as a Spider-Man villain in the early Seventies, the man known as “the living vampire” helped cash in on the horror-crossover craze and eventually earned his own solo stories in titles like Adventures Into Fear, where he promised to only feast on those who crossed society’s lines. His dislikes included webslingers, werewolves, vampire hunters named after sharp objects (looking at you, Blade) and clothes that were not one-piece jumpsuits with plunging necklines and very large collars. His likes included Ghost Rider, the blood of the guilty, piña coladas, and long walks on the beach. Even when he teamed up with other spooky antiheroes/superheroes — your Man-Things, your Manphibians — Morbius wasn’t exactly the most compelling player in Marvel’s deep bench of monsters. He felt like a fanged footnote at best. But hey, Sony owns the rights to a stable of Spidey-adjacent characters, and that includes the good plasma-craving doctor. Plus, movie audiences and stockholders hunger for anything even slightly superheroic, so guess who’s got his own movie now? Initially, Jared Leto‘s inaugural turn as the lauded biochemist who tries to cure his own rare blood disease with bat DNA and then, whoops, becomes a scientifically superhuman vampire, was supposed to hit theaters in July of 2020; a certain pandemic caused it to be delayed to March 2021. Then the movie’s release seemed to be continually punted down the road, and it was hard not to wonder if maybe, just maybe, this game of multiplex-schedule musical chairs wasn’t solely Covid-related. Having now endured this addition to the cinematic Spider-Canon … let’s put it this way: A wise man once said that you should never confuse shit with cioccolato. We’re not sure everyone involved with the making of Morbius listened to that bit of advice. When we meet Dr. Morbius, he’s not in good shape; the illness that’s plagued him since his childhood in Greece has left him frail and unable to walk without the help of canes. But that doesn’t stop him from flying down to Costa Rica and gathering up every single bat he can find in the name of research. He’s brilliant, you see, and extremely driven — the gent turned down the Nobel Prize because the lifesaving fake blood he invented wasn’t up to up his standards! — and also, he thinks the dozens of winged mammals he keeps in a terrarium in his office hold the key to a cure. This “Bat-man,” if you will, creates a serum that, because it’s highly unethical and completely illegal, he must test on himself while sailing in international waters. His fellow scientist-slash-romantic-interest, Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), is thankfully along for the ride. The result leaves a ship full of corpses and her alive but unconscious. But it also makes Morbius feel better than ever! And gives him superhuman strength! And the ability to glide on the wind, just like his furry little friends! Whereas once Leto sported a Peter Murphy-esque pallor, he’s now jacked and looks like a superhot rock star — call him Thirty Seconds to Morbius! The downside is that Morbius craves blood, and he has tendency to get a little monstrous when he indulges. The fake blood he invented all those years ago helps keep him stable, but only for about six hours. The real stuff lasts longer, but after witnessing the carnage he left on that boat, the doctor has vowed “not to drink the red.” Unfortunately, his childhood friend Milo (Matt Smith), who suffers from the same disease as Morbius does, has no such compunction about tapping jugulars after he sneakily downs the serum as well. It’s a pure good vamp/bad vamp showdown from here on out. You can tell that the creators want to keep one foot firmly planted in Sony’s ongoing Spider-Verse — there’s a reference to “that thing in San Francisco” for you Venom lovers, and given that he’s listed on the film’s IMDb page, no one’s hiding Michael “Remember when he played the Vulture?” Keaton’s involvement — while dipping a toe or two into some horror-flick territory. Director Daniel Espinosa (Safe House) seems more comfortable with the second part, leaning heavily into the creepy elements as much as he can; you can sense him having fun as he stages a sequence involving a nurse, a predator, and a hallway with motion-activated lights. Yet when things require elements like the coordination of action, or narrative momentum, or helping establish a sense of character past “bad dude” or “damsel in distress,” he comes off as a little lost in the corporate fog of Superhero I.P. 101. Once Morbius becomes a vampire, his preternatural powers are rendered via colorful, almost mist-like trails that streak and dissipate as he moves. It’s a good way to visually distinguish his character at first. Once you have two vampires fighting in subway stations and rooftops with these traits, however, the action sequences start to resemble someone vomiting onto a Jackson Pollock painting. As for Leto, he’s restrained himself from chewing the scenery despite having those bitchin’ fangs, and goes for a more brooding, moody, existentially-conflicted-hero mojo that feels par for the course he’s forced to play on. No actor should have to sell dialogue like the follow-up to a description of his super-hearing — “‘bat radar,’ for the uninitiated”; that’s the actual line — or the solemn declaration that those flying mammals “now greet me like a brother.” Matt Smith’s gleefully evil bad guy may not be the most dangerous Marvel villain ever, but he does wear chic designer suits with running shoes, so his Milo is definitely the douchiest Marvel villain to date. Tyrese Gibson shows up as the youngest cop ever to be too old for this shit, while his partner Al Madrigal cracks wise and then cracks wiser. We love Jared Harris, who plays Morbius’ mentor, so we’re leaving him out of this altogether. Pay that mortgage, my man. Is Morbius the worst Marvel movie ever made? In an alternate universe without The New Mutants, the answer would likely be yes. And with all these multiverses now colliding into each other, who knows: There may even be a world out there where things actually came together for this old-school comic-book bloodsucker onscreen, where his determination to fight his newly monstrous nature while taking on the corrupt and the criminal gave us a deeper, darker antihero and Leto the chance to make his mark in the larger Marvel ecosphere. We’re stuck in this timeline, where the Morbius we’ve got is, plain and simple, a mess. If it’s not the worst of these films, it’s certainly the most anemic — and even die-hard fans are apt to feel completely drained by all of it."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," A Bat Man of a different kind rises in MORBIUS: a man who splices his DNA with a vampire bat’s in order to cure his terminal blood-born disease. His conflicted character also unfortunately serves as an energy vampire, sucking you dry of your lifeblood and brainpower. Director Daniel Espinosa’s adaptation of the Marvel comic is heavily weighed down by exposition, logistical nonsense and generic conflicts that barely allow anything original to rise to the surface. Missing much of its connective tissue to make sense of its shenanigans and acting as a delivery device strictly to tease what emptily caloric delight might be next, this titular anti-hero is given a vehicle that takes its foot off the gas not far enough into the ride. Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) is world-renowned, bad boy scientist hell-bent on finding a cure for blood-born diseases like the one he and his best friend Milo (Matt Smith) have been struggling with all their lives. Armed with disposable wealth thanks to Milo’s funding, he’s searched far and wide and believes he’s found a solution, hidden deep in the jungle recesses of Costa Rica where vampire bats dwell. After one encouraging medical trial, he elects himself the guinea pig to begin the highly unethical human experimentation. And with fellow researcher Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) at his side to help, nothing could go wrong. Except it does. Things go pear-shape for the pair when, after Michael takes the alleged life-saving serum, he turns into a vampiric monster. This newfound gift quickly turns into a curse, however. Michael’s bestowed with superhuman strength and bat-like abilities, but only if he guzzles human blood every few hours. This causes him to do things he’s not proud of like feasting on his hired henchmen. Yet as soon as his company founder Milo catches wind of his pal’s physical improvements, he too wants the upgrade – one Michael refuses, leaving them on the outs. Meanwhile, FBI Agents Stroud (Tyrese Gibson) and Rodriguez (Al Madrigal) notice exsanguinated bodies beginning to pile up, including one of Dr. Morbius’ own staff, making him the prime suspect. Only there’s another tormenting creature causing the ruckus, forcing Michael to embrace his new capabilities and save the city. Espinosa and screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless task the audience with too much hoop jumping when it comes to its multitude of weak spots and confusing logistical applications. This causes a litany of distractions during each sequence, everything from why hallway lights in a business powered by disposable income would have energy-efficient settings, to how the antagonist even got their hands on the dangerous vampire serum, plus injected it themselves. Their attempts to pull inspiration from DRACULA and THE USUAL SUSPECTS are noteworthy, solely because these references inspire many to cringe and audibly groan at their use. Humor is attempted a few times, but mostly collapses in on itself. A joke about Pilates being Michael’s reason for renewed vigor is beyond a decade stale, but so awkward its effect, it’s funny again. Murky motives overpower the scenes and character arcs causing more questions than answers. Jared Harris, who plays Michael and Milo’s doctor/ father figure, is barely fleshed out as one-dimensional, yet used as a catalyst to begin the 3rd act. Same goes for Martine, who’s little more than a hollow attempt at a Strong Female Archetype and more like a stereotypical damsel in distress. Longtime friends turning into foes is clichéd, well-traversed territory already on-screen and this doesn’t add anything new to the equation, though it does provide some emotional resonance and weight to the story. Still, any pathos or gravitas conjured by the actors or screenwriters is undone by ridiculous, predictable and unearned revelations. Espinosa and his visual effects team do an admirable job visually contextualizing their protagonist’s skillset, from his use of echo-location (representing soundwaves as a pulsating, iridescent rippled shimmer) to his rapid striking power (moving with a smokey, slo-mo effect). While, in the big action set pieces like on the cargo ship, tension increases the more the monster is obscured, when Michael does let his inner vampire appear, the makeup department handedly crafts a spooky, disturbing design. Nevertheless, with little to no body horror, nor having any foreboding sense of dread threaded throughout, the picture painted is a sloppy mess that won’t leave anyone asking for more."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," Sony’s Morbius is ostensibly a Spider-Man spin-off, but in many ways the Marvel movie has more in common with DC’s solemn The Batman. Michael Morbius is a moody, Byronic scientist living in New York, with rich sponsors to fund his research into the rare blood disorder he suffers from. The answer could possibly lurk in the DNA from which animal? You guessed it, the bat. After mixing bat DNA with human DNA, Morbius becomes essentially a man-made vampire, and must wrestle with his new lust for blood while protecting those he loves. It’s a pretty simple set up, pulled from the pages of the comic books, which in turn were clearly influenced by everything from Dracula to Jekyll and Hyde, with the usual references to addiction thrown in. Leto brings enough intensity and humanity to the role to engage, but he’s not helped by the script from Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless that favors exposition over character development. Adria Arjona is particularly poorly served by her character Dr. Martine Bancroft — we only know that she is clever and has a cat: superhero movie shorthand for being conveniently single. Her main job seems to be getting Morbius to explain his science in a language the audience can understand. Tyrese Gibson has a perfunctory role as a detective, while as his colleague, Al Madrigal provides the first laugh of the film — approximately 50 minutes in. The most fun to be had here is with Matt Smith’s Milo, Michael’s best friend who has the same disorder and has accumulated considerable wealth and a taste for the good life. Smith throws himself into this enjoyable role. It’s good to see characters with chronic illnesses at the center of the story, and an opening flashback to their youth sets the scene well enough. But one imagines some potential backlash from the disability community about the way their plotlines develop. This movie isn’t terrible. Leto is good, the VFX work is slick, and there’s modest entertainment to be had here and there. But it seems unlikely to please crowds like Spider-Man: No Way Home  — and the mid-credit scenes are more baffling than exciting.

"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," There’s nothing like on-screen text over a crystal-clear establishing shot to tell you exactly how stupid a filmmaker thinks their audience is. Sometimes it’s the big, bold “PARIS, FRANCE” chyron over an aerial shot of the Eiffel Tower; sometimes we get a widescreen image of the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, and the Capital building with a helpful “WASHINGTON, D.C.” In “Morbius,” our title character is explaining to his best friend that an experimental procedure has to be performed in international waters, after which director Daniel Espinoza cuts to a giant shipping boat, in the middle of the ocean, with the words “INTERNATIONAL WATERS, EASTERN SEABOARD” plastered on the bottom of the screen. Did… did they think that we would be confused? In their defense, however, they’re making a movie for an audience that is ready to plunk down their hard-earned cash for a Jared Leto comic book movie, so maybe it’s best not to overestimate anyone’s intelligence. Leto stars as Dr. Michael Morbius, whom we first meet capturing a whole mess of vampire bats in Costa Rica before we leap back into a flashback of his hospital-bound childhood. Morbius has a rare blood disorder that inflicts exhaustion and constant pain, and he has considerable trouble walking. But he has a gift for science and mechanics; his mentor, Emil Nikols (oh no, Jared Harris) sends him to a school for gifted children, informing him, “You have a gift, Michael. It would be a shame to see it go to waste.” And then we’re back in the present day, where we discover Morbius has won the Nobel Prize for developing a life-saving “artificial blood,” but that was a mere byproduct of his ultimate goal, which is to splice human and vampire bat DNA to cure his blood disease. (Uh, ok?) Yadda yadda yadda, scientific explanation, he’s closing in on a “highly experimental, morally questionable” cure, which is how we wind up on that boat in international waters for that old comic book movie standby, the experiment-gone-awry sequence. His “cure” fills Morbius out from a bony weakling to a swaggering beefcake, but he kills eight guys and drinks their blood during the transition, oopsie doodle. (The ship is called the Murnau, the movie’s one clever touch, and single indication that its creators have ever seen a non-comic book movie.) The one thing that could make “Morbius” unique among its comic book movie brethren – or, at least, less of a thing we’ve seen a million times before – is the less-ubiquitous idea of a supervillian (rather than superhero) movie. Alas, and in spite of the carefully misleading ads, Morbius isn’t really the villain; that would be Milo (Matt Smith, poor Matt Smith), Morbius’ childhood friend and partner-in-illness, who helps himself to the “cure” as well and becomes a worse super-vampire, more cold-blooded and blood-thirsty, not all bummed out about it like his wet-blanket pal. Morbius thus becomes the lesser of two evils and must stop Milo, so the audience can have a proper rooting interest, etc. But before that, we get multiple, cringe-worthy scenes of Smith dancing and mugging and trying to steal the show, under the woefully misguided notion that he’s Nicholson in “Batman” or something. He’s not the only performer adrift here; as an investigating detective, Al Madrigal, dear sweet Al Madrigal, tries his absolute hardest to fulfill the role of comic relief without the helpful tool of “jokes,” or any feedback whatsoever from Tyrese Gibson, at his most wooden as Madrigal’s partner. There’s nothing much to say about Adria Arjona, who is saddled with no discernable character traits and the most perfunctory romance in comic book movie history, which is saying something. (Michael Keaton, whom the trailers make look like a full-fledged co-star, appears for maybe a minute – in closing credit scenes.) Talented filmmakers spent time and energy on this thing – Oliver Wood shot it, Pietro Scalia cut it – though director Espinoza (“Life”) isn’t one of them. Action scenes are poorly staged, shoddily animated, choppily edited (complete with random moments of slow-motion), and clumsily shot; at the conclusion of one, the movie seems to just give up, and simply shakes the camera for a few seconds. Once the vampire plot kicks in, it goes from badly aping the tropes of superhero movies to badly aping the tropes of horror movies, just as incompetently. By the end, it’s all auto-pilot; they get so desperate, they trot out bullet time. (More than once!)"
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," Sony’s Spider-Man Universe has its first expansion out of Venom territory with Morbius, the Jared Leto-led superhero flick about a so-called “Living Vampire.” Director Daniel Espinosa approaches this bat-man’s beginnings with horror flourishes once seen in his sci-fi thriller Life, but they’re never pronounced enough that they’ll satisfy horror audiences. Morbius presents its origin story with the most formulaic structure, as an overly serious Leto is doing the opposite of Tom Hardy’s campy Venom schtick that so many adore. It’s a choice that promotes Morbius’ moral conundrum as a self-conscious vampire over anything considered “superhero cinema fun,” taking everything deathly serious to an ultimate detriment. We’re introduced to Dr. Michael Morbius as a Nobel Prize winner with a crippling blood disease he’s vowed to cure. His acclaim, and his company Horizon’s breakthrough, is an artificial blood that has saved countless lives — the seafoam-colored liquid represents one of the film’s outlying blasts of color amidst putrid darkness. Morbius works alongside scientist and eventual romantic interest Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) in the name of his ailing best friend Milo (Matt Smith) since their early private health care treatments. It’s the epitome of serious consequences brought upon by fraternal love as Morbius splices vampire bat DNA with a human subject — himself — leading to his ghoulish transformation into a not-yet-proven-controllable killing machine. One of the early problems in Morbius is how the origin beats cycle through the monotonous motions. There’s a lacking energy behind Dr. Morbius’ condition because we know he’ll eventually go all man-bat, nor is there any attempt to creatively dump exposition that could have been read as an introductory text scroll. Countless superheroes and supervillains boast the same creation tale — writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless struggle to set apart Morbius’ emergence despite introducing such a horror-forward character. In regards to larger cinematic universes and hopeful sequels, Morbius rolls through introductory motions only to close out just as our interest climaxes. It’s always a first-step movie that exists because it has to exist for later reasons, which becomes apparent as the script fast-forwards through most explanations or descriptive advancement. It’s jarring to watch the digital effects-heavy Morbius so soon after Greig Fraser’s stunning cinematography in The Batman, since the former becomes another blurry post-production eyesore. Nothing is practical as Leto’s chiseled cheekbones turn into the angular, skeletal scowl of Dr. Morbius, who’s trailed by a spectral mist of sound waves whether he’s lunging, dashing, or flying. Morbius is a gloomy, black-on-black-on-black tapestry in so many sequences that monochromatically lose visual interest. Morbius flies past New York City skyscrapers like Spider-Man discovering his web-slinging for the first time, but there’s nothing aerially spectacular. No grand gothic gestures in cinematography, just an F. W. Murnau reference here, or Freddy Krueger cue there. Morbius feels churned out of a Superhero Movie factory, made from stock parts — except for Matt Smith’s portrayal of Milo. He appears to have just waltzed off the set of Venom: Let There Be Carnage, allowing his dapper underworld adventurer a colorfulness the film desperately needs. Smith’s flamboyance and spirit is the antithesis to Leto’s drearily dour genius, which is a purposeful but inefficient comparison. As the two continually cross paths, it’s Smith who consistently steals scenes despite Dr. Morbius’ name as the movie’s title. Smith does so bloody good playing bad, to the point where everything almost becomes one notch above bearable (read: almost). So Morbius advances, calling on direct Batman imagery as the winged creatures swirl overhead and taking jabs at Marvel’s mightiest Avengers. A stern tone becomes the film’s downfall, because there’s nothing exceptional about poorly underwritten supporting characters — Adria Arjona, Jared Harris as Milo and Dr. Morbius’ caretaker Emil Nikols, Tyrese Gibson as agent Simon Stroud — and dizzying animated action. Sony’s reliance on digital renders for Venom and Carnage work because there’s an absurdity to their roles as actors talk to themselves, which isn’t a benefit of Morbius. Here, audiences are fed exactly what they’re most likely expecting from this bargain-bat origin that’s a bit exhausting until too late. Morbius is unspectacular in ways that waste the potential of what could be an intriguing hybrid of sinister horror and superhero thrills. One single scene recalls David F. Sandberg’s Lights Out for a suitable fright, but otherwise horror accents are limited to cheesy jokes about Dracula. That’s the approach the whole film takes, in fact. Everything feels superfluous and uninterested in thoughtful storytelling because the mission at hand is to get to the end credits where the meat exists. Morbius is so focused on building Sony’s Spider-Man Universe and hopeful sequels — which could very well be better now that the foundation exists — that it forgets about enthusiastically engaging its audience from the start."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," Morbius is a movie Sony has been trying to make since the early 2000s, and the film being released in 2022 feels like a relic from that early 2000s era of superhero movies, and not in a good way. Director: Daniel Espinosa
Summary: Biochemist Michael Morbius tries to cure himself of a rare blood disease, but he inadvertently infects himself with a form of vampirism instead. Sony has been trying to make Morbius happen for pretty much as long as they have had access to the character. When you think back to the cultural mindset of the early 2000s, making a movie based on Morbius makes at least a little sense, all things considered. Vampires were the ""it"" thing, and the goth thing was very much the aesthetic of the late 90s and into the early 2000s. All of this makes sense for a movie based on Morbius to come out sometime before 2005. However, a film based on Morbius in 2022 is a little stranger and what is even weirder is the script that Sony is putting up on the big screen appears to be a script that they could have used twenty years ago with almost no changes. Everything about this movie, from the special effects to the story to the tone, feels dated. It's like getting transported to that era when comic book movies were ashamed to be based on comic books, so they tried to make everything look cool to fifteen-year-old boys and precisely no one else. That is the only crowd Morbius is aiming for; fifteen-year-olds from the early 2000s who thought they were too cool to admit that they liked comic books. It really shows that Sony and everyone else thought that they didn't need to really put in any effort, and people would flock to the theater because they can say that this is a Marvel property, and that is enough these days. There isn't a single moment in Morbius that feels original or like something we haven't seen in better movies or, for that matter, in the first two Blade movies. A better idea would be to stay home and revisit those first two Blade movies instead of seeing this if you really want a blast from the past type of experience that has some vampires and better gore. Even the design of the vampire form itself looks dated. They were trying to make the creature design as comic accurate as possible while also bringing it to the big screen and to live-action, but there is a problem here; it doesn't look modern. The issue of the Morbius creature design has nothing fundamentally wrong with it, and when the character was created in 1971, it probably was perceived as unique. However, that was over fifty years ago, and in those fifty years, people have been adapting vampires for the big and small screen in very different ways. One of the most beloved television shows of the time period that this movie feels like it is a relic from has vampires. One of the movies that kicked off the 1-2-3 punch that started off the superhero boom that we live in today has vampires. That movie actually almost had Morbius in it. There was a whole other series of movies that came out in the early 2000s that had vampires as well. The design of Morbius is not a problem, but the issue is they adapted it straight and then did nothing around it. They just planted this version of the character in the real world and went, ""all right, here go,"" and they didn't do anything to make it unique. They relied entirely on the allure of the Marvel lore for its worldbuilding to make up for the fact that they didn't want to make this world or this version of vampires interesting. If there is a movie to compare this to, it would probably be Venom, but it is considerably less fun than Venom. However, much like that movie, Morbius also has one cast member that appears to be in a completely different film from the rest of the cast, and this time it's Matt Smith. Smith seemed to be the only one who knew he was in a movie about a dude that splices his genes with a bat and becomes a vampire for Reasons and decided that turning it up to eleven was the only way to go. He is clearly having a ball, and the only time the movie even feels like it comes alive [zing] is when he's on-screen. Star Jared Leto, however, seems to think he's in some super serious melodrama and is playing everything so insanely straight that it's nearly comical. However, it never quite gets to the point where it becomes amusing to watch him mope around with his ridiculously long hair that he never pulls back for some reason and makes growling noises. All of this could have been excused or at least tolerated if the action made up for everything, but if you've seen a trailer, then you know what to expect. The action in Morbius also feels dated in the sense that they seem to think bullet time is still this awesome thing that everyone must have just discovered because The Matrix just totally blew all of our minds a few years ago. Everything about the fight scenes looks goofy, which would work if the rest of the movie wasn't trying to take all of this so seriously. Then there is the final act, where entire story points and character arcs are just forgotten, and it seems like whole scenes are just not there, and the movie just ends. However, it doesn't just end; it throws in two of probably the worst mid-credit scenes ever put on camera. A scene like this is supposed to make you excited for more; these are confusing, frustrating, and make even less sense than the movie we just saw. Morbius doesn't overstay its welcome as it clocks in at just under 100 minutes, and while Smith is fun to watch, there really isn't anything here. We've seen all of this before, and it's more apparent than ever that Sony has no idea what they are doing with these characters. Morbius takes itself far too seriously to be any level of enjoyable to watch and truly feels like a relic of superhero films that is older than a decent portion of the audience that might go to see this. When the second credit scene teases more to come, it doesn't feel like a promise; it feels like a threat."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," “Morbius” may very well be the exception to that rule. I tend not to pay attention to internet buzz, buzzlessness or noise because it tends to save my personal. But when the rancor reaches epic levels, some things are unavoidable. In the case of “Morbius,” that noise has been deafening in its criticism. For once, the internet was right. And this comes from someone who liked the “Venom” films with Tom Hardy. They, at least, possessed some sense that they were more comedic diversion than anything else. “Morbius” wastes a few good actors in Jared Leto, Jared Harris and Matt Smith (“Dr. Who”) in this latest tale from Marvel Studios about a doctor who turns himself into some form of a vampire in this straight-up money grab. Leto stars as Dr. Michael Morbius, a doctor who has suffered from a rare genetic condition all of his life. We meet him as a preteen just as he’s formed a friendship with Milo (Smith) in a private medical facility. The facility’s head physician (Harris) discovers Morbius is gifted and arranges for him to attend the best schools in New York City, where he excels in medical research, eventually winning and declining a Nobel Prize. Morbius is determined to solve the condition he shares with Milo, who remains a friend even after 25 years, and that leads him to discover a link between his disorder and bats. Of course, he does what every well-intentioned, ambitious, desperate scientist does. With the aid of his partner Martine (Adria Arjona), he experiments on himself. Things go horribly awry as Morbius awakens from the experiment with a thirst for blood and realizing that he’s literally created a monster. Milo, who has been footing the bill for Morbius’ work, couldn’t be more thrilled when he finds out, despite the fact his friend tells him that he’s asking for trouble.  Who can guess what’s going to happen next? Say hello to Morbius’ first nemesis — his bestest buddy in the world. How utterly Shakespearean, no? Along the way, we’re treated to a couple of Marvel references: “I’m starting to get hungry and you wouldn’t like me when I’m hungry.”  And, yes, the special effects can impress as well as annoy. But Morbius, despite the best efforts of its cast, suffers from a number of problems. It’s not a Marvel film showing its A-game. At its absolute best, it’s pedestrian and lacks scope. At its worst, it is unintentionally silly. Throughout its entire runtime, it unspools in a very predictable manner. For Marvel fans, the cash grab is obvious. Although I’ll pass on providing a spoiler, two key post-credit scenes set up the possibility of a film based on the “Sinister Six,” a group of Marvel supervillains, connected to Spider-Man, who join forces to cause mayhem. From those scenes, it appears a long-rumored film based on those characters, for whom Sony has theatrical rights, could be in the offing. Got to keep those Spider-Man-related bucks flowing, right? Yes, that’s an absolute cynical take, but there isn’t a lot to enjoy in “Morbius.” Like many films during the COVID-19 era, it suffered through release delays. It could have endured another much longer one and not have been missed."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," All those movie Batmen have the impressive costumery and in some cases the cool, bat-based toys and those pricey Batcave living quarters, and sometimes there even are some actual bats hovering about—but as far as I can recall, none of ‘em has ever injected himself with actual bat DNA like Dr. Michael Morbius. I mean, talk about a guy who has earned the twisted right to call himself Batman! But he’s not The Batman, he’s the titular character of “Morbius,” a second-tier MCU movie with some interesting performances and a few flashes of inspiration that unfortunately never goes deeper than superficial storytelling and grows increasingly tiresome over the relatively brief running time (1 hour, 48 minutes) before it reaches a predictable, underwhelming conclusion. (Even the two brief mid-credits scenes teasing the further adventures of Morbius are less than stirring.) Jared Leto, who has never met an accent, a wig, a prosthetic, a dramatic weight loss or a Method role he couldn’t sink his teeth into, actually plays it somewhat straightforward and grounded as Michael Morbius, a brilliant scientist who invented an artificial blood “that has saved more lives than penicillin,” or so we’re told at a Nobel Prize ceremony. (Distractingly, another character calls it the “Noble Prize,” not once, but twice, in the next scene.) Looking like he’s been pounding at death’s door since last winter, Michael is suffering from a rare and fatal blood disease, and despite the financial backing of his lifelong friend Milo (Matt Smith), who has the same condition, Michael been unable to come up with a cure—and time is running out for the both of them. Cue the bats! As Michael explains to his longtime associate and potential love interest, Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), certain types of bats are the only creatures that can survive by consuming only blood, so if Morbius injects himself with vampire bat DNA, maybe that’ll fix him up real good! (Man, I don’t know. Even the likes of Seth Brundle from “The Fly” and Dr. Norman Osborn aka Green Goblin might think that was a bat-bleep crazy idea.) With Milo’s backing, Michael builds a lab on a tanker that will sail international waters off the East Coast (what with this process being illegal and all), with Martine onboard to aid with the experiment and a bunch of armed henchmen along for the ride in case things go awry. Within moments of receiving the injection, Michael is transformed into a howling, fanged, clawed, bloodthirsty beast who wreaks havoc before jumping off the ship and returning to New York City. (The Northern Quarter of Manchester, England, doubles for New York, but there’s never a certain sense of place and time about this film. It seems self-contained and smallish. We never get the sense the good people of New York are truly interconnected with “The Vampire Murderer,” the lackluster term assigned to Michael by the tabloid press.) Michael’s transformation and subsequent, periodical returns to normal human form seem more wolfman-like than vampiric, as he doesn’t have the usual aversion to sunlight, fear of garlic or holy water, etc. For the time being, Michael is able to sustain himself on artificial blood, but the window in which he remains human is tightening, meaning it’s only a matter of time before he’ll have to resort to guzzling the real deal. Ah, but Michael’s old friend Milo has no such moral qualms. Against Michael’s warnings, Milo has injected himself with the vampire bat DNA — and he immediately turns into a killing machine who embraces his role as a super-sucking, super-villain. Dancing about with a hairdo and wardrobe that conjures up images of David Bowie in his “Let’s Dance” period, bellowing statements such as, “I am resurrected,” Matt Smith as Milo gives a terrifically over-the-top performance — but there’s never any explanation for why Michael would be so conflicted and torn about his transformation, whereas Milo would suddenly turn into a psychopath. He seemed like a really good guy before he, you know, shot up bat DNA. The great Jared Harris does what he can with an underwritten role as Emil Nikols, the obligatory Kindly Mentor to both Milo and Michael, while Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal are stuck playing cynical, bantering NYPD detectives who ask questions straight out of the “Law & Order” playbook and are always showing up at the scene of the crime and shaking their heads at the carnage. As for the action sequences: When Michael Morbius flies around the city, he often leaves a smoky trail of blue or orange in wake, like a gender reveal where they ordered the wrong colors, and the big finale is shot in dizzying closeups, edited in headache-inducing fashion and often murky. It looks like “Morbius” might soon cross paths with Spider-Man in one universe or another, but that would be a big step up for him, because his introductory vehicle feels more like a just-average 1990s vampire movie."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," Renowned scientist Dr. Michael Morbius has a brilliant idea. In order to cure a debilitating bloodborne illness, he will combine human DNA with that of a Costa Rican vampire bat.  The issue is personal. Michael (Jared Leto) and his best friend Milo (Matt Smith) both have a lifelong mysterious disease that weakens their bodies and forces them to walk with two canes. Determined, he illegally experiments on himself. The tired and gloomy new Marvel movie “Morbius,” which is made by Sony and not part of the massive Marvel Cinematic Universe, suffers from chronic obviousness. Of course, Dr. Morbius (Jared Leto) is gonna become Batboy. Of course, Milo (Matt Smith) is gonna want in on the action. Of course, the character I shan’t name is gonna accidentally wind up a vampire too. Director Daniel Espinosa’s film isn’t a disaster — just a bat-nap. Comic book films are often formulaic, yes, but you need only look to last year’s “Spider-Man: No Way Home” to see that there are ample opportunities for the unexpected. Here, there are only opportunities for Leto to be a creep and wildly contort his body. That is the most predictable part of all. “Morbius” is one of Marvel’s growing number of antihero films — a more palatable one than dumb-as-rocks “Venom,” at least — about an off-putting person who develops a destructive power that he can’t fully control and whom we don’t know how to feel about for two hours. The viewer struggles to care. We’re also aware that there are many, many better vampire stories than Count Dreckula here (check out the Netflix series “Midnight Mass”) and not much sets this one apart besides its sexlessness and lack of wit. It’s closer to the horror genre than most Marvel films; however, it’s never scary.  Aesthetically it steals from a lot of what came before it. In one scene, Morbius stands in the center of a tornado of bats as a booming score blares, just like Christian Bale did in “Batman Begins.” When Morbius and Milo go into vampire mode, their mugs look like emo versions of Spike from “Buffy the Vampire Slayer.” And, come on, an experiment that turns a guy into a bat is a helluva lot like a lab accident making Peter Parker into a spider. Leto is at his best when he isn’t flying around hissing and using echolocation. He’s well-cast (all the actor needs to do to prepare to play a vampire is wake up), and you believe he cares for Milo (Smith, as we saw on “The Crown,” does brat well) and his colleague Martine (Adria Arjona). However, the scenes with young Michael (Charlie Shotwell) at the beginning are better and more moving than anything that comes after. The cacophonous ending sets up a sequel, but I hope it never sees the light of day. Actually, considering it’s about vampires, maybe I do! "
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," Morbius, the long-delayed next film in Sony’s Spider-Man universe, is like a roller coaster without a pulse.  There are highs, there are lows, there’s plenty of disorientation, and by the end, you aren’t upset with the ride, but largely underwhelmed because you have the sense it should have been better. Oscar winner Jared Leto stars as Dr. Michael Morbius, a rich, genius doctor who has spent his entire life looking to cure his very own rare blood disease. Which, eventually, he does. Except the cure involves splicing human DNA with bat DNA and it turns him into a bloodthirsty vampire. The desire to kill humans and drain their blood is bad but everything else that comes along with it is good: super strength, speed, enhanced movement, and hearing. So Morbius decides he needs to figure out how to balance the two. Will he be a hero? Or will he be a villain? At the start, that’s the basic idea of Morbius and, after an at first interesting but ultimately confusing opening scene that never comes back into the narrative, the film begins on that trajectory. We see Morbius as a young child, he meets another boy he nicknames Milo who shares the same rare disease, and eventually, the two grow up to be rich and successful. Morbius wins a Nobel Prize for creating synthetic blood and Milo... also grows up to do something of note. We don’t know what exactly, but we know it’s good because older Milo is played by Matt Smith and he lives in a nice apartment. As those relationships and characters get introduced, director Daniel Espinosa (Life) seems interested in exploring all the various dynamics. What it’s like to be a person fighting for your life and what it would be like to win that battle, even if it came at a great cost. And eventually, the idea of struggling between hero and villain seems poised to drive the film. However, at a certain point soon after Morbius becomes  a vampire, the film loses its focus. One bad story decision leads to another. The rules and boundaries of these powers are never defined and eventually, the story of Morbius trying to find his balance gets pushed to the side. Instead, he becomes a fugitive at large and once Morbius finds himself behind bars, so too does the film, as all character development is derailed in service of narrative excess. The tide does turn for a while when Matt Smith’s Milo becomes more prominent. The film’s marketing has largely kept Smith out of it but suffice to say he’s much, much more crucial to the film than the trailers might lead you to believe. We won’t say exactly what happens but if you had a life-long best friend with whom you shared the same terminal disease, and then one of you found a cure, cursed as it may be, well... you can begin to connect the dots. Smith makes the most of his newfound importance to the film and relishes every second he’s onscreen with a comic book glee that can border on parody. It’s in these moments though, especially juxtaposed with the deathly serious tone of the movie around it, that Morbius’ cracks really become prominent. Smith’s Doctor Who-esque bravado versus Leto’s stoic intensity just makes you want more of the former. More humor. More energy. More wow. This is a comic book movie after all, right? And there is certainly some “wow.” The visual effects-driven action sequences in Morbius have a dynamic, unique way of attempting to quantify the vampire’s powers. They’re fluid and propulsive, almost like the string-cheese symbiote of Venom mixed with the dense battiness of Batman Begins. These scenes are few and far between however, and they’re certainly among the best beats in the movie, especially when it’s Leto’s Morbius battling the film’s surprising main villain. Once Smith gets moved to the forefront, you quickly realize that Morbius’ new story about two friends struggling with powers is even more compelling than what the film originally seemed like it was going to be about. But that’s the problem. That there’s even a question of what story Morbius is trying to tell is a stake through the heart. Halfway through the movie, it’s almost like everything that came before is completely derailed or subverted. Detectives who had been looking for Morbius, played by the wildly miscast Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal, are mere afterthoughts. Morbius’ friendship with a fellow doctor played by Adria Arjona becomes a romance almost out of nowhere, and that whole idea of “How do I balance being a killer vampire and being a good hero?” that began the movie goes away, never to be heard from again. Finally, the ending of Morbius is so shockingly abrupt, it felt less like the end of a story and more like 20 minutes are missing. Morbius has a few good ideas in it and the action scenes are decent, but even the good stuff just makes the other stuff look worse in comparison. Jared Leto is coasting on his movie-star status, Smith blows everyone else off the screen, and Arjona is completely underused. Outside of those action scenes, there’s very little about Morbius that distinguishes it in any way, even in terms of its connection with fellow Spider-Man films. All told, it’s a messy void that isn’t terrible when you’re watching it, but leaves a bad taste in your mouth by the end."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," It’s become something of a running gag on the internet that “Morbius” isn’t really a movie. Online observers insist that, from its ever-changing release date over the last two years to its grim and somewhat goofy premise involving Jared Leto as a scientist who turns into a vampire, this has to be an elaborate prank and not an actual film. Leto does indeed star as Michael Morbius, a world-renowned physician — talented enough to invent an artificial blood substitute, iconoclastic enough to turn down the Nobel Prize he won for the invention — who has grappled with blood-borne disease since childhood. With the financial support of lifelong friend and fellow patient Milo (Matt Smith), Michael has become a leader in his field, even as he branches out into morally questionable territory, exploring the possibility of grafting vampire-bat DNA with human DNA. Like “The Wasp Woman” and countless other cinematic mad scientists who tampered in God’s domain, Michael tries the experiment on himself, discovering both a cure (he’s strong, buff and can hang from the ceiling) and a curse (he transforms into a fanged creature starved for human blood). With the help of love interest and fellow doctor Martine (Adria Arjona, “6 Underground”), Michael uses the artificial blood to slake his thirst for the real thing, even though each use of the substitute keeps his literal demons at bay for less and less time. When Milo injects himself with Michael’s experimental bat DNA and revels in his newfound power (and thirst), it’s up to Michael to stop both of them from feeding on the city. Screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (“Gods of Egypt”), adapting Roy Thomas and Gil Kane’s original Marvel character, don’t seem particularly interested in the metaphor of mega-rich Milo seeing the rest of humanity as nothing more than fuel for his sustenance, but then they don’t seem much interested in anything beyond the usual world-building and sequel-crafting that plagues so many mediocre comic-book movies. Director Daniel Espinosa, previously responsible for such competent and forgettable action sagas as “Life” and “Safe House,” finds some entertainment in the set-up of “Morbius,” crafting what’s essentially a big-budget spin on an old American International Pictures horror movie, complete with a shadowy laboratory. (Michael works in a Manhattan facility that can accommodate both individual patients and a huge, glass tubular cage for imported vampire bats.) But once the film builds to the inevitable Michael vs. Milo showdown — taking seemingly forever to get there, and making one further appreciate the expedient pacing of “Venom: Let There Be Carnage” — we’re left with lots of VFX (the movie becomes practically a full-on cartoon at this point) but very little skin in the game in terms of plot or character. Apart from his physical transformation, Leto doesn’t really have anywhere to go, since Michael Morbius is already full-on goth before he gets the vampire-bat DNA; he’s given to shoulder-length hair, black ponchos, and even black latex surgical gloves when he’s at work. It’s a far more subdued performance than his recent florid turn in “House of Gucci,” but a subdued Jared Leto is less interesting than an over-the-top Jared Leto; some artists just work best when they color outside the lines. Jared Harris (as Michael and Milo’s doctor and mentor) and Smith are mostly wasted here, as is a very monotone Tyrese Gibson as a New York cop. (His partner is played by Al Madrigal, who does what he can to inject some sorely needed comic relief.) If there’s any reason to want to see sequels or spin-offs, it’s because of Arjona’s Dr. Martine Bancroft. Even when the story goes off the rails and the film can’t decide on its vision of Manhattan — where skylights look like disco dance floors, and Wall Street bars somehow have parking lots — she never wavers. Her character’s strength, compassion, and resilience make her the MVP of “Morbius.” And that might or might not, in this case, stand for “More Vampires, Please.”"
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL,"  In recent years, Sony Pictures has been building out their own interconnected franchise of Marvel movies, beginning with Venom in 2018 and spanning a handful of movies, the most recent of which is Morbius. However, while Sony's Spider-Man Universe has adapted some of Peter Parker's famous villains, the live-action series doesn't have their own webhead just yet. Instead, Sony has confirmation that their Venom and Morbius movies are connected to the MCU via the multiverse, as revealed in Spider-Man: No Way Home. But until Sony introduces Spider-Man to their live-action universe, the movies must stand on their own merits. Unfortunately, Morbius does not. Despite a fine performance from Jared Leto, Morbius is a painfully mediocre superhero origin story, delivering a shallow recreation of better movies.   Leto stars as Dr. Michael Morbius, a scientist with a blood disorder for which he's dedicated his life to finding a cure. He's able to cure himself by splicing his DNA with that of vampire bats, but he turns himself into a living vampire in the process. Michael gains certain abilities ,like super strength and sonar hearing, but he also needs to drink blood in order to survive. Michael's life is made more complicated when his childhood best friend Milo (Matt Smith), who suffers from the same condition, steals the serum that cured Michael and turns himself into a living vampire as well. With the help of his fellow scientist Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) and his father figure Nicholas (Jared Harris), Michael must find a way to put a stop to Milo's murderous rampage on New York City, all while avoiding being arrested by FBI agents Simon Stroud (Tyrese Gibson) and Al Rodriguez (Al Madrigal).   Directed by Daniel Espinosa (Life, Safe House) from a script by the writing duo of Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (Dracula Untold, Gods of Egypt), Morbius struggles to find fresh ground to cover in a landscape of superhero movies that have exhausted the standard origin story over the last two decades. The plot of Morbius follows the exact same beats as most superhero movie origins, but where Sazama and Sharpless's script struggles is in the character development. Instead of focusing on who Michael is, Morbius spends much more time explaining the exact powers and abilities he gains with his vampirism, using them to deliver a host of action scenes. But without any compelling character story at the heart of it, even those action set pieces fall flat and fail to set Morbius apart from the host of other superhero movies that already exist.   For their parts, the Morbius cast do their best with the material they're given. Leto's Michael is a fine hero, but he's lacking in personality and motivation. Michael starts out being dedicated to finding a cure, but once that's done, it's as if the movie doesn't know what he wants next. Without the hero as the guiding light of the film, Smith's Milo becomes the clearest character, if only because he does have some semblance of a personality and his motivations are clear. As such, Smith becomes the standout in Morbius, though that isn't saying much since Milo is still a run-of-the-mill villain, especially by Marvel movie standards. Milo falls into the same trap as many MCU villains, where he has the exact same powers as the hero, but he's evil. The rest of the Morbius supporting cast are serviceable, but fail to make much of an impression.   Perhaps what's most frustrating about Morbius is there are elements of the film that could have worked to help make the movie more enjoyable. Early on, when Michael is first turned into a vampire, he stalks the mercenaries on board a ship in an action scene that ramps up the horror of the situation (though it's hindered by the film's PG-13 rating). Espinosa plays with horror in another scene a little later on, but Morbius is unfortunately too concerned with remaining a superhero movie to go full-on horror. Similarly, the friendship between Michael and Milo is meant to be the heart of the movie, but it's not developed enough. So when Milo takes a villainous turn, there's little emotional impact. In the end, Morbius has some interesting ideas and concepts, but Espinosa's execution behind the camera — and Sazama and Sharpless on the script — end up hamstringing the movie.   As a result, Morbius isn't a must-watch entry in Sony's Spider-Man Universe. Those already interested in seeing Morbius may find something to enjoy, especially with Leto and Smith's performances. Perhaps the biggest thing the movie has going for it are its MCU connections, which were teased with Michael Keaton's Adrian Toomes (aka Vulture) showing up in the first trailer. However, these connections are rather minimal and quite puzzling. So while Marvel movie die-hards may be excited by Vulture's appearance, casual fans or those who don't enjoy superhero movies as much will be fine skipping this one.   Morbius will release in U.S. theaters Thursday evening, March 31st. It is 104 minutes long and rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence, some frightening images, and brief strong language.  The LEGO Group has released five new Star Wars sets for March 1st, celebrating the toy company's 25th anniversary with the galaxy far, far away. Tyler Perry's latest movie, Mea Culpa, was a Rotten Tomatoes disaster, but his next movie is on its way to being much better received by critics."

"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," Here’s a little knowledge to impart on the non-superhero fan in your life about the new film “Morbius”: Jared Leto is a bat man but he’s not Batman. Or Spider-Man. Or any of the other many cinematic superheroes the film tries to copy. Directed by Daniel Espinosa (“Life”), “Morbius” (★½ out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters Friday) is the next major movie to introduce a new Marvel comic-book character to the movie fold, seemingly based in Sony’s Spidey-centric galaxy (see also: “Venom”) instead of Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe. But the worst superhero outing since “Fantastic Four” doesn’t really fit anywhere: With Leto flying and jumping through New York City as a do-gooding bloodsucker with moral “Should I feast on my fellow man?” quandaries, “Morbius” is a lifeless slog with no real bite. Suffering from a rare blood-borne disease since childhood that leaves him weak and is slowly killing him, scientist Dr. Michael Morbius (Leto) is determined to find a cure to help old friend Milo (Matt Smith) and others with this same illness. Morbius travels to Costa Rica  for vampire bats so he can mix their DNA with human genes for some highly illegal experiments. With the help of fellow doctor (and love interest) Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), he thinks he’s finally cracked it and tries it out on himself, leading to a transformation into a buff dude with superhuman strength, crazy jumping abilities and sweet echolocation skills. Oh, and a taste for blood. The artificial stuff he slurps works at first but he wants the real human thing more and more. Morbius also begins to lose control, and he gets pegged as a serial killer by authorities even though there is another “vampire murderer” on the loose that Morbius has to battle. The whole thing is pretty silly – apparently being a “living vampire” means he’s got a weird bat face rather than one of those sexy “Twilight” vamps – and extremely derivative. “You would not like to see me when I’m hungry,” Morbius says with a stern face, aping the old “Incredible Hulk” TV show. But, aside from Smith’s inexplicably goofy dancing every so often, there’s no self-awareness whatsoever. Instead of having even a dark sense of humor, the film’s simply hellbent on being a superhero horror movie yet fails at being a good superhero film or an effective horror treat. Coming off of Leto’s enjoyably campy turn in “House of Gucci,” his Morbius – best described as a goth-friendly mix of Popeye, Dracula and the Hulk – is a dour disappointment. The prosthetics he wears to match the facial look of his original comic counterpart look good when he’s snarling still, but when he starts flipping around, fighting, or just quickly swapping between regular dude and vampire guy face, the special effects prove to be a letdown. Smith’s character suffers from a lack of development as does Jared Harris’ role as a mentor to Morbius and Milo. “Fast and Furious” stalwart Tyrese Gibson plays a cop in pursuit of the newly vampiric doc – his job is mainly to grimace a lot. And Michael Keaton reprises his role as the Vulture from “Spider-Man: Homecoming” although he also seems to be wondering why he’s there. Most of the MCU movies and some of the recent DC films like “The Suicide Squad” are case studies on how to best introduce obscure superhero personas onto the screen. The gonzo “Venom” movies know and proudly own what they are. “Morbius” misses all those lessons and seems to be stuck among the more lackluster films from the early to mid-2000s a la “Elektra.” Even the mid-credits scenes that attempt to bring Leto’s role into a larger landscape wind up being more confusing than cool."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Morbius is Marvel's most flavorless installment yet...severely lacks energy and excitement, which shows in the final product."
"Mar 31, 2022",POSITIVE," PLOT: Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) seeks to cure his rare blood disease by injecting himself with the DNA of vampire bats. The plan works but also turns him into a blood-drinking superhuman. He can control his bloodlust, but the same cannot be said for his similarly afflicted best friend, Milo (Matt Smith), who uses his powers for evil. REVIEW: You have to hand it to Sony – the extended Spider-Verse (or – as they call it, Sony’s Spider-Man Universe) has worked way better than anyone thought it would. Venom and its sequel overcame pretty toxic reviews to become box office juggernauts, and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse became a classic. Now, with Spider-Man: No Way Home opening the door to allow the extended Spidey universe to mingle with the legit MCU franchise led by Tom Holland, the sky is the limit. Morbius was shot before No Way Home, but there are enough hints dropped here to set it within the extended Spider-Man universe, meaning we may soon see Leto’s Morbius go up against Spider-Man. However, the question of which version is the one fans will no doubt be asking once they see this long-delayed superhero flick. Morbius is similar to the Venom films. More modest in scale than anything in the MCU, this is light, fast-paced superhero action, running a lean 100 minutes. It probably cost about a third of what No Way Home did, so if you expect a large-scale superhero epic, you’ll be disappointed. However, if you don’t mind a smaller addition to the franchise, you’ll find that Morbius works relatively well as decent entertainment. Jared Leto makes for a likeable Michael Morbius. It’s rare to see him in more heroic parts, with him often playing villains, but he’s admirably straightforward as the heroic Morbius pre-transformation. Morbius is presented as a kindly doctor eager to better humanity, although he knows he’s on a ticking clock, with his disease on the verge of ending his life prematurely. He also bristles against his physical limitations, explaining his relationship with Adria Arjona’s Martine. She’s a medical associate who carries a big torch, but he’s unwilling to go there with her as he figures he’ll soon be dead. His only real relationship is with Matt Smith’s Milo, a similarly afflicted billionaire who bankrolls his work. At the same time, a wildly under-utilized Jared Harris plays their father figure, a doctor who’s Milo’s full-time care-giver. The relationship between Morbius and Milo grounds the film somewhat, making the latter’s eventual transformation into a villain carry a bit of pathos for our hero, as he has to fight his only real friend. Once Morbius becomes strong, Leto displays a physicality we haven’t seen in many of his more recent roles, with him impossibly chiselled while he gets to mix it up in a few brief fight scenes. The transformation into the vampiric side of Morbius is done through CGI, with the vampire side of the character peaking out any time he starts to hunger for human blood. Leto is a divisive figure, but I think he’ll win over a lot of people here. At times he’s even low-key. Meanwhile, Matt Smith seems to be having the time of his life as the scenery-chewing baddie, going purposefully over the top as Milo begins to relish his new powers. Director Daniel Espinosa similarly has fun with the comic book origins. The cinematography gives this a bright, colourful look that’s a far cry from the more noirish approach of something like The Batman. Espinosa also embraces the horror aspects of the plot, using an iris-out at one point, and staging one really cool attack sequence in a way that pays homage to An American Werewolf in London. However, Morbius has a few issues. Notably, both Harris and Arjona are wildly under-used. Both disappear from large stretches of the film and could have used more screen time. Also, a bickering cop pair played by Tyrese and Al Madrigal adds nothing to the plot except for a little tacked-on comic relief. Why bring Tyrese into a movie like this if he’s not going to get any action. Morbius also rushes towards its climax, similar to the last Venom film, as if they ran out of resources and had to wrap things up quickly. I wish Sony had pumped up the budget a bit more to give the character a more significant launch, but keeping it modest means it doesn’t have to open to The Batman numbers to make it a success and continue the franchise. In the end, Morbius is a decent enough start for the latest addition to the Sony Spider-Man Universe. While I doubt fans will be clamouring to have him join the MCU right away, it would be cool to see him show up in perhaps another Spider-Man spin-off, especially if Sony ever manages to entice Andrew Garfield to reprise the character in a legit The Amazing Spider-Man 3. Only time will tell. Chris Bumbray began his career with JoBlo as the resident film critic (and James Bond expert) way back in 2007, and he has stuck around ever since, being named editor-in-chief in 2021.

"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," Sony so badly wants their own cinematic universe that they've wrought ""Morbius,"" an absolutely dreadful piece of pre-packaged junk that throws a bunch of CGI ghoul faces our way and hopes for the best. A mash-up of vampire movies and '90s superhero flicks, ""Morbius"" is officially part of the studio's clunky, cobbled-together, ever-changing Sony's Spider-Man Universe, which no one will ever confuse for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While Sony still has their grip on Spider-Man, they also have a whole slew of other Spider-adjacent characters at their disposal. They got lucky with ""Venom,"" which succeeded despite its many flaws thanks to a highly recognizable main character and a more-than-game performance from Tom Hardy. No such luck this time. ""Morbius"" star Jared Leto can go big and over-the-top if he wants to (just look at his recent turn in ""House of Gucci""), but he's sleepily subdued here. So is everyone, really. There's no energy to be found in the film; nothing even close to a spark. Everyone shuffles through their scenes as if they're suffering from a cold medicine hangover. ""Venom"" is not what I'd call a good movie, but it never got boring. ""Morbius"" might very well put you to sleep.  ""Ah well,"" you might be saying. ""Are the special effects good? Are we at least distracted by some big, cool superhero spectacle stuff?"" Absolutely not. This is an ugly film, staged in non-descript rooms and sterile labs. Everything is awash in a Windex-like blue tint. There's no sense of scale — or place. If it weren't for several establishing shots of the New York skyline, we'd have absolutely no idea where ""Morbius"" is set. As for how, or why, this film connects to the larger Sony Spider-Man Universe, well, I'll leave that for you to discover, reader. Just know the results are about as dumb and disappointing as everything else that goes on in this puddle of garbage juice disguised as a movie.  Leto is Dr. Michael Morbius, the type of brilliant scientist who is constantly being reminded of his brilliance by everyone around him. He also suffers from a deadly, and cinematically vague, blood disease that should've killed him by now. Instead, Morbius has devoted his life to trying to find a cure, for both himself and his life-long friend, Milo (Matt Smith), who suffers from the same ailment. During his acclaimed career, Morbius has gone ahead and invented life-saving synthetic blood — but he's still been unable to cure himself (and Milo). Finally, Morbius thinks he has the answer: crossing human blood with vampire bat blood and testing it on himself! The movie gives us some iffy explanations as to how this might work, but honestly, I didn't need them. It's fine. I know this is a ludicrous premise, and I have no problem with that. By all means, get silly! Unfortunately, there's no room for silliness here. ""Morbius"" doesn't want to stop for a single second and admit how goofy it is. Instead, it plows ahead with a Very Serious Tone constantly at war with what's actually happening up on the screen.  In true ""mad science run amok!"" fashion, things don't go according to plan, and Morbius is transformed into a monster. He's sort of a vampire, in that he can fly around and sprout fangs and wear a trench coat like a cape. And oh yeah, he gets some superpowers! He's strong, and fast, and he can hear things really well now! He can turn into a cartoonish blur that blasts around a room. And he's also really, really close with bats. ""They welcome me as a brother!"" he narrates at one point, referring to his new winged pals. Sure, whatever you say, Morbius! While all of these new skills might be seen as a blessing, they also come with a heavy burden. For one thing, Morbius can't quench his thirst for blood, which puts others around him in danger. For another, when he gets angry, the character is prone to having his face morph into a CGI mess, all ghoulish cheekbones, oversized fangs, and a snout-like nose. This is probably moot at this point, but gosh: what the hell ever happened to practical make-up effects? Remember the glory days of Rick Baker and those in his field? The type of artists who could take tangible materials and transform a human being into something otherworldly? That used to be magical. Movies used to be magic. And I want that magic back.  But more often than not, it feels like those days are pretty much long gone, never to return. Why hire a creature makeup artist when you can just bury Jared Leto in digital nonsense? Maybe I'm grasping at straws here. But a film as shoddy and poorly planned as ""Morbius"" requires one to reach out for dear life, looking for something, anything, to cling on to. If we must be subjected to this drivel, can we at least have a sliver of relief here and there? Bring the magic back, that's all I'm saying. Give me something, people. Work with me.  Morbius' new monster form leads to some deaths, which convinces the good doctor that this was all a mistake. But Milo doesn't care. He wants to be well again, and so against Morbius' advice, takes the human/bat blood cocktail himself. This allows Milo to become the film's villain. Why? Because that's what the plot calls for. Everything here is paint-by-numbers, and a hero needs a villain. Never mind that there's absolutely nothing to explain why Milo becomes a full-blown bad guy and Morbius remains noble. It doesn't matter. Smith, bless his heart, tries really hard to inject some sort of life into his character. But there's only so much he can do. He at least fares better than Adria Arjona, who is utterly forgettable as Morbius' fellow scientist, Martine. Since she's the main female character, that aforementioned paint-by-numbers approach requires her to become Morbius' love interest, even though Arjona and Leto have nothing even resembling chemistry. Characters will show up and attempt something resembling banter now and then, but the dialogue and delivery have all the cadence of a parakeet mimicking words. Scratch that; a parakeet would probably sell the lines better. And scenes in ""Morbius"" don't so much end as fizzle out. It's as if everyone runs out of things to say and then the editor gives up and cuts to something else.  Perhaps the most infuriating thing about ""Morbius"" is how inert it ultimately is. This movie isn't aggressively bad, or bad in a fun, entertaining way. It's just plain old regular bad. It's bad in the way something uninspired is bad. Something that was constructed without an ounce of love, care, or interest. It's abundantly clear that no one involved here — not Leto, director Daniel Espinosa, nor writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless — has any investment in what they're creating. I'm guessing all of these folks have sat for interviews at one point or another during the film's marketing campaign and said ""I love the character of Morbius and I'm excited to bring him to life!"" or something close to that. If so, I assure you, they're not telling the truth. They're running through talking points. This is not a work of art made by people who care. This is a product. To be fair, all Hollywood movies are. But so many of them are better at convincing us otherwise. ""Morbius"" offers us nothing worth savoring. It exists simply to spawn sequels and spin-offs in true mercenary fashion. But just because we're being spoonfed this gruel doesn't mean we have to happily lap it up and ask for seconds. "
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," Matt Smith and Adria Arjona also star in Marvel’s origin story of the conflicted antihero, a doctor who gets cozy with vampire bats to treat his rare blood disorder. After his bizarrely cartoonish turn in House of Gucci, it’s a relief to see Jared Leto channel his lust for transformative characters into a film where that’s quite literally written into the role’s DNA. He plays the title figure in Morbius, known as “The Living Vampire” in the Marvel comics from whence he hails. Leto gets to juggle time as the brilliant Dr. Michael Morbius — who has spent his life searching for a cure for the rare fatal blood disease that afflicts him — with the blood-sucking monster he becomes, which fills his soul with horror. After a promising start, Daniel Espinosa’s long-delayed film only intermittently matches the intensity of the lead performance, and the script by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless becomes thin on story, choppily stringing together chaotic outbursts and action clashes that build to a painstakingly foreshadowed “sibling” face-off. None of that seems likely to deter the geek faithful, even if this new entry in Sony’s Spider-Man Universe often seems a lot like a boilerplate Venom installment, without the humor. A tense prologue takes place in Cerro de la Muerte in the misty mountains of Costa Rica, where a frail, emaciated Michael hobbles from a helicopter on crutches into the mouth of a cave that’s home to thousands of vampire bats. While the chopper pilot frets about getting out of there before dark, Michael spots a half-devoured animal carcass and notes admiringly that even though the bats weigh almost nothing, they can overpower a creature almost ten times their size. Without warning, he slashes open his hand to serve as bait. Cut to 25 years earlier in Greece, where the young Michael (Charlie Shotwell) is in a clinic under the care of Dr. Nicholas (Jared Harris) when he meets new patient Lucien (Joseph Esson), a British boy roughly the same age and with the same blood disorder. They bond instantly, with Michael giving his new friend the nickname Milo and likening the two of them to the Spartans: “We are the few against the many.” Which is the only semi-discernible reason for this part to take place in Greece. Back in the story’s present in New York, Michael has become a renowned doctor, who shocks his trusted colleague, Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), when he turns down the Nobel Prize for his development of artificial blood. That’s just the beginning of his work, Michael explains, which is where the “aquarium” — actually a massive upright cylindrical glass chamber — full of bats brought home from Costa Rica comes in. Both Michael and Milo (Matt Smith) continue to be treated by the weirdly ageless mentor figure of Dr. Nicholas. Milo, meanwhile, has inherited a fortune, so he’s bankrolling Michael’s lab experimentation while hungrily soaking up whatever life he can in his louche, playboy style, as his body continues to deteriorate. Given that the procedure of mixing human and bat DNA is considered both unethical and illegal, the first trial has to be done in international waters off the Eastern Seaboard, on a cargo boat manned by shady mercenaries. Martine injects the serum into Michael’s spine, and though we don’t witness the actual transformation, we definitely see the end result spring into action, which is bad news for the crew. The upside is that it gives Michael Olympian athletic prowess, superhuman strength and exceptional sonic radar. Oh, and springboard skills that soon morph into the power of flight. The downside is creepy bat eyes, a gnarly manicure, fangs and a thirst for human blood that needs to be sated whenever the serum wears off. The movie from there on out is basically Michael wrestling with his conscience, vowing that what happened on the boat can never happen again, while FBI agents Stroud (Tyrese Gibson) and Ramirez (Al Madrigal) investigate the string of violent deaths that begins there, with corpses mysteriously drained of blood. The body count is destined to keep climbing when Milo gets his hands on the serum and reveals fewer scruples about his new favorite tipple. “All our lives we’ve lived with death hanging over us,” he tells Michael. “Why shouldn’t they know what it feels like for a change?” Besides, the bat transformation of Milo’s face when he’s on the juice does wonders for Smith’s cut-glass cheekbones. But the different views of Michael and Milo toward suppertime inevitably will set brother against brother, with Martine at risk in between. While DP Oliver Wood shoots most of the action with the lugubrious palette that’s become standard for this end of the Marvel spectrum, he makes atmospheric use of New York’s subways and underground spaces in several scenes. The thundering score by Jon Ekstrand, with its pounding percussion elements, also pumps up the energy, even as the plot slides into repetitive grooves. The look gets a boost from the effects team’s visualizing of sound waves received by Michael and Milo whenever they’re in vampiric mode, bouncing off people, objects and buildings in their paths. Their speedy movements are also trailed by a dusting of color; that’s never really explained, but it looks cool, especially when Michael’s in an orange prison jumpsuit or a flapping black coat with bright purple lining. Their facial transformations are entirely digital, done without prosthetics, effectively straddling the divide between photorealism and comics. But like so many movies rooted in comics, much of Morbius seems like groundwork for more complex storytelling to come, and especially for crossover chapters, one of which is set up in two mid-credit sequences involving a character (and star) seen previously in Spider-Man: Homecoming. It’s just a shame this opening salvo takes itself too seriously to have much fun with the mayhem, despite the potential in Smith’s devilish turn for amusing interplay between the antagonists. Arjona carries herself with confidence, but her character also gets a little lost in the carnage; perhaps the late-breaking romance between Martine and Michael will acquire more of a heartbeat in the next round. Leto certainly broods up a storm behind his veil of rock-star hair, yet the movie has too little to distinguish it from the second-tier (or maybe third?) Marvel pack, ending up as more of the same."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL,"There's some kind of invisible force here, hurrying things along in the hopes of a future team-up, making sure Morbius arrives more undead than alive."
"Mar 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"  Branding aside, Batman has never really done bat things. He may have the swag and the color scheme, but there's no real communion, if you will, with the small winged mammals that gave him his name. Not so Marvel's Morbius, the dark hero who finally gets his due in the titular film hitting theaters this Friday. The fact that it's really only half a movie — much like Dune, its entire plot is essentially the preamble to a larger story — only partly diminishes the lizard-brain fun of watching Jared Leto zip around for 100-plus minutes like a you-know-what out of hell, sucking the blood from hired thugs and finance bros and then feeling really bad about it.
  He's a killer with a conscience, you see: Dr. Stephen Morbius, a world-renowned scientist so gifted and so principled that he can casually turn down a Nobel Prize. His sole aim in life is to cure the disease he was born with, some kind of rare disorder that leaves him in a permanently weakened state. He's not alone in his misfortune; there's a childhood friend who shares his illness, Milo (Matt Smith), and the kindly man who cares for them, Nicholas (Jared Harris), both established in early flashbacks. In the present day, there's also Martine (Adria Arjona), the fellow researcher who is, by the laws of Hollywood, both improbably hot and remarkably amenable to sudden startling alterations in Stephen's DNA.
  It turns out that a scouting trip to a well-stocked cave in the wilds of Costa Rica has borne fruit for the good doctor; after a little tinkering in the lab, a syringe of precious bat-liquid gives him the life he's never had. With each infusion his withered legs grow strong, and his concave chest turns to Men's Health marble. He can run, leap, fly! He also can't stop draining humans like they're Capri Suns, feeding on the pints of hemoglobin that instinct tells him he needs to survive.
  Swedish-Chilean director Daniel Espinosa (Life) gives it all a dark sheen, and shoots the pair's inevitable confrontations less like traditional comic-book clashes than something from The Matrix. The air around them moves like liquid ribbons, and even in peak CGI, their fights looks like something between jet propulsion and underwater ballet. Logic and plot flow are generally treated like civilian casualties, but the movie, with its canny mix of whiz-bang violence, goth atmosphere, and high camp, feels pleasingly pulpy and urgent up until its last minutes, when the narrative doesn't so much wind down as run smack into the final title card.

"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," Sony is desperate to build a universe out of Spider-Man characters, independent of Spidey himself. With the popularity (if not the quality) of the Venom films, they’re full steam ahead on this quest. With the long delayed Morbius, it sure seems like first making good origin stories is not on their minds. This movie is messy, edited to ribbons, hard to follow (but without much of a plot), and never once makes a compelling case for why it exists. The character itself has a lot of potential, but little to none of it is seen here on the screen. Plus, Morbius somehow might have two of the worst credits sequences of the stinger era. This flick has basically sat on a shelf for three years, but for all the money, it feels like a forgettable relic from the 1990s. Morbius has such an anonymous feel to it that it’s impossible to work up any strong feelings, one way or another. It’s bad in boring ways. The things it does well it does in such a forgettable key. This is the worst kind of mediocrity, since it’s clear the studio wasn’t sure what they wanted from it in the first place. Nothing set this film up for success, that’s obvious, but the execution still leaves a tremendous amount to be desired. Biochemist Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) suffers from a rare blood disease, one he’s had since childhood. The leading researcher in his field, he’s been attempting to cure his illness, this time seeing the mixing of human and vampire bat DNA as the cure. Assisted by Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), Morbius sees his initial failure turn into a success. Inadvertently, however, the process doesn’t just cure him of the disease. It also infects himself with a form of vampirism. Not only does Morbius now require blood to survive (while gaining superhuman abilities), his childhood friend and financial backer Milo (Matt Smith), who suffers from the same disease, is infected the same way. The only difference is, while Morbius is struggling against some of his new instincts, Milo is giving in and beginning to kill. With the cops after them both, a confrontation is inevitable. Jared Leto is fine here, but it’s a workmanlike performance that anyone could have done. For better or worse (sometimes both), Leto usually makes big choices. That’s the not the case here. On the other hand, at least Matt Smith is having a blast. He tries to chew as much of the scenery as possible. No one else looks like they’re having fun. This includes the aforementioned Adria Arjona, as well as supporting players like Tyrese Gibson, Jared Harris, Al Madrigal, and Charlie Shotwell. Even the cameo from Michael Keaton doesn’t get out unscathed. In fact, that’s somehow the nadir of this mess. Director Daniel Espinosa is normally a solid action filmmaker. Here, he showcases very little of that. To be fair, the script from Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless gives him very little to work with. Still, the shoddy CGI, the sometimes incomprehensible editing/plotting, and the general blah-ness of it all is indicative of something having gone very wrong. Cinematographer Oliver Wood certainly is trying something with the action, but nothing about the visuals clicks. Then, there’s the ending. Botching the Keaton cameo and the credits sequences too, which are basically free bits of goodwill to generate, is a mind-boggling mistake for Espinosa and company. Morbius is a boring and forgettable mess. Any comic book fare that is this much of a slog is never a good thing. If we see a sequel, there’s at least the kernel of something here to build on, but it’s impossible to leave this movie feeling optimistic about the character and his place in this Spider-Man world. Frankly, this film should have just stayed on the shelf, collecting dust. I continue to admire your optimism and ability to see the promise in any idea, no matter how musty or boring they come off to me. Saw the trailer in the cinema and even that looked a mess!.. Reading your review it must have been close to only getting one and a half stars. Now, I don’t put any stock in CinemaScore grades as an “objective” marker of a movie’s quality, but the extreme highest and lowest scores can be a really interesting indicator of a film’s appeal to the masses. Sometimes an F CinemaScore piques my interest even more because it often means the film is really weird and refreshingly unconcerned with appealing to the average joe (like mother! and the Solaris remake)."
"Mar 31, 2022",POSITIVE," Ninety percent of all superhero movies end up with two guys fighting it out on a roof. It’s a cliche of the genre that seemingly can’t be avoided, and indeed “Morbius” has a scene like that, too. But it’s how the new film handles the superhero cliches that makes it a success. Bad directors, when confronted with stale material, choose to blow it out, to make it bigger, noisier and longer, partly just to show off and partly to distract audiences from the fundamental emptiness of what they’re trying to sell. But “Morbius” director Daniel Espinosa goes in the other direction. If it’s something you’ve seen before, like a rooftop battle, he’ll give you just enough and no more. But if it’s something new, something interesting between the characters, he lavishes time. Consider this: He’s from Sweden, and he has never directed a superhero movie before. That means that “Morbius,” a Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters film, was his big break. Yet instead of making a bloated, self-important atrocity like the nearly three-hour-long “The Batman,” he actually chose to make a good movie. Moreover, he chose to make a good movie about a vampire superhero, as if that were easy. And he did in 104 minutes, including credits. It could have been awful. Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) is a Nobel laureate suffering from a blood disease that has been killing him since the day he was born. With time running out, he embarks on a line of clandestine research involving mixing human DNA with vampire bat DNA. His intention is to extract one curative element from bats, but he gets more than he bargained for. He is restored to health, but he is also given superhuman strength and an insatiable thirst for human blood. Leto (“House of Gucci”) is a good actor, but if left unchecked, he can overdo it. That would have been fatal here. Instead, Espinosa keeps all the performances naturalistic. The situations are extreme, but the emotions are real. In the end, the great appeal of Leto’s performance is that he doesn’t play Morbius as the usual solipsistic superhero, who only cares about his own deep feelings. Morbius is an entirely decent guy, who is appalled at the possibility of hurting others. Burk Sharpless and Matt Sazama’s script, based on the Marvel comics by Roy Thomas, is a skillful mix of elements from “The Fly,” “Dracula” and “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.” From the beginning, the story has a sense of urgency, because the illness of Morbius and his best friend, Milo (Matt Smith), is made vivid. We meet them as suffering children, and then we see them as suffering adults, looking thin as death. One of the remarkable visuals of “Morbius” is how Leto’s body is made to look almost skeletal, like that of a concentration camp victim. It’s so convincing one could easily believe that Leto lost 40 pounds for the role, as he did for “Dallas Buyers Club.” But then we see him in the next scene, post-transformation, looking muscular and robust. Adria Arjona, who to this point has had a modest resume, stands out as Morbius’ fellow doctor and research assistant, the woman who would be his girlfriend if he were healthy enough to have one. Smith, who looks a little like a vampire bat to begin with, finds himself in the plum role of Morbius’ mercurial childhood pal, and Jared Harris brings a gentle reality to the role of Milo’s lifelong mentor and caretaker. There’s no filler. At its best, “Morbius” keeps the audience riveted, wondering what will happen next. In the end, it ends up where all Marvel movies end up, on a roof, and looking like a blown-up computer screen. But the obligatory fireworks don’t go on long enough to spoil anything."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEGATIVE," Comic book movies have come a long way in the last 20 years. In the aftermath of Blade, X-Men, and Spider-Man, which successfully revolutionized the genre, the industry unleashed a series of shallow, hollow ventures that were consistently cringe-worthy, but proper creative investment in the material eventually dismissed that terrible era. As full potential in the material has been recognized, the films are now made with the specific intention of having depth and emotion come part-and-parcel with spectacle and flash. The storytelling has improved tremendously, allowing audiences the world over to discover what readers of Marvel and DC magazines have known for decades. While watching Daniel Espinosa’s Morbius, I found myself regularly thinking about this special pop culture evolution. With as many great things we have seen come out of comic book movies in recent years, the finished product here suggests that the brains behind the operation weren’t cognizant of any of them. In a time when on-screen superheroes and supervillains are more dynamic and complex than ever, Morbius is the worst, most boring version of itself that it can possibly be – happy to serve up a narrative that is 100% plot, fail to introduce even a single interesting or compelling character, and execute action that is nothing more than murky shadows accented with colorful smoke. Jared Leto is the eponymous Michael Morbius in the film, a scientist who has long lived with a debilitating blood disorder that he has spent years trying to cure. Working with Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) at New York-based Horizon Labs, he hypothesizes about mixing human DNA with that of a vampire bat, believing that the flying rodents’ natural anti-coagulants will be the key to eradicating his disease. After animal testing, he prepares for human trials – which is to say giving himself an injection. Because it’s an illegal procedure, Morbius has to get private funding for the experiment from a childhood friend suffering from the same condition, Milo (Matt Smith), but before too long he is out in international waters on a cargo ship with Dr. Bancroft and a team of armed mercenaries. (Why armed mercenaries? Your guess is as good as mine.) Of course, the procedure goes horribly wrong, as the genius doctor is transformed into a feral beast and needs to drink human blood to keep himself under control and healthy. (It’s worth noting that he never actually tries to see if animal blood will do the trick.) Morbius sees himself as a monster after killing several people, but Milo is purely focused on the cure to the blood disorder, and after taking his own dose, he becomes your standard mirror villain: possessing identical abilities to the hero, but with an antagonistic philosophy. The nicest thing that I can say about Morbius is that it is efficient in its storytelling – but even that’s a shaded compliment given that ruthless efficiency serves to drain any and all flavor out of the proceedings. There are no styles or textures applied, and not even a single scene in the entire 104 minute runtime that gives insight to the personalities and perspectives of the characters beyond what is happening in the moment. The script coldly navigates from plot point to plot point, failing to engage with the details of the world, and just execute Origin Story 1.0. This zero frills/nothing interesting approach is only made more noticeable by the ideas that it ignores. For example, Morbius has invented an artificial human blood that prevents him from drinking the real stuff, and it’s implied that there is a different effect that it has on him, but it’s never made explicit. It’s also repeatedly said that the efficacy time of what he imbibes is diminishing, and he tracks the progress on his digital watch – but even with that introduced, the film never does anything as compelling as having the protagonist in a race against the clock before he goes full living vampire. The most devastating side effect of the structure and pacing of Morbius is what's done to the characters, who are all steamrolled into 2D-ness by the plot. There isn’t a single role that can’t be summed up in two words. Jared Leto’s Morbius: Sad Vampire. Matt Smith’s Milo: Happy Vampire.  Adria Arjona’s Dr. Bancroft: Loyal Partner. Jared Harris’ Dr. Nicholas: Paternal Figure. Tyrese Gibson’s FBI Agent Stroud: Serious Cop. Al Madrigal’s Agent Rodriguez: Sarcastic Cop. It’s the entire cast – though nobody could pin the blame on the actors given what they are working with. Usually in movies this bad, there is at least one person in the ensemble who demonstrates a fourth wall-esque awareness of the crap they are contributing to and delivers a wink-filled performance that suggests that they are at least trying to have some fun –but not Morbius. There is no relief of that sort offered by this film, and it’s all the more punishing because of it. On top of everything else, even discernable, impactful action sequences are beyond the film’s grasp – though it is very clearly working at a disadvantage because of its PG-13 rating. Between what’s being chugged and what’s being spilled, there is a lot of blood in Morbius… but that gets a big no-no from the MPAA when a studio is trying to sell a movie to under-18 audiences. The “shortcut” utilized to get around this is to have everything play out in shadow or at night, but the end result is that you can rarely tell what the hell is going on. Only hurting and never helping are VFX flourishes that are painted in seemingly reflecting the main character’s echolocation abilities and perception of air currents, allowing him to fly (admittedly I’m meeting the movie more than halfway with the second one, as that’s purely my understanding of what’s going on). The goal in part seems to be to add some nice rainbow splashes in the otherwise caliginous palette, but all it really accomplishes is adding heavy doses of blur. If you’re one who follows the business side of the film industry, you know why a Morbius movie exists: Sony is white-knuckle desperate to be relevant in the world of superhero blockbusters, and it is passionately trying to wring every single last dollar that can be made from its ownership of the big screen rights to Spider-Man and all Spider-Man related characters. Commercially speaking, it’s all kinds of logical, but artistically, it’s been a total train wreck – with this loathsome latest product being the follow-up to the dismal twosome of Venom and Venom: Let There Be Carnage. Morbius is a movie that is so creatively bankrupt and lacking in entertainment that I feel compelled to actively implore anyone reading this review to not purchase a ticket and let it die a quick, flopping death. There is no fun to be had here; there isn’t any ironic or “so bad it’s good” enjoyment. It’s soulless. It’s oozing, tar-like gunk that has been spit out of the Hollywood machine, and you should avoid stepping in it. Eric Eisenberg is the Assistant Managing Editor at CinemaBlend.

"Mar 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"Morbius is a film that requires one to play along and enjoy the project for what it is. While one absolutely could sit shaking their head as the film plays, it feels entirely possible to get onto the same wavelength as the project and enjoy the ride."
"Mar 31, 2022",NEUTRAL," That is partially why – and no real fault of Sony, since they couldn’t plan all the ups and downs of this pandemic  – Morbius may already be feeling stale and tired even before it finally hits theaters this weekend. There’s also the obvious hurdle of Dr. Michael Morbius being a perfectly fine Spider-Man supporting character in the comics, a flawed anti-hero, but not one that necessarily deserves or warrants a solo movie vehicle for Jared Leto to play the medical genius with a rare disorder that causes him to drink blood to improve said condition.  Before we learn much about him, we meet Dr. Morbius in Costa Rica, as he is capturing voracious bats for some scientific experiment. We then flashback to his youth as an outcast being treated with another young man with a similar condition, and then back to present day as Morbius is close to solving his problems by combining human and bat blood into a “blue blood” variant that can improve his condition. It also gives him super-strength and other bat-like powers that draws out his instinct to drink the blood of all those around him.  A few notable filmmakers have mentioned that the best way to approach a comic book movie is by not actually looking at it as a “comic book movie,” but rather, transposing the characters into a more proven film genre. In this case, Morbius director Daniel Espinosa (Life) clearly was hoping to make something more like a horror movie, which certainly makes sense for the character. Hence, the results are a lot more Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde or Cronenberg’s The Fly than it is Dracula, even if it tries hard to throw in clever Easter eggs like naming Morbius’ floating lab the “Murnau” after the German filmmaker who made the earlier silent vampire film, Nosferatu.  This isn’t a terrible vehicle for Leto, who I still think is a pretty decent actor who always tries to make the most out of any character he plays, in this case enhanced by make-up and CG as necessary. It’s just the few times when he tries to put any sort of humor into things (as has become de rigeur for these movies) where things just fall flat, but that’s also because the writing just isn’t up to snuff. Matt Smith isn’t much better as his friend-turned-antagonist Milo, because he just resorts to hamming things up, which seems to be the only way to make a villain interesting any more. The film repeatedly cuts back to Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal as literally the worst police detectives on the planet trying to investigate dead bodies drained of blood that clearly point to Dr. Morbius. And yet, instead of keeping him locked up, he’s just released.  Adria Arjona plays Michael’s collaborator, Dr. Martine Bancroft, but she isn’t given much to do beyond being a typical comic book love interest, while Jared Harris’ mentor (of sorts) mysteriously comes and goes without bringing anything to the story. Morbius is very much a throwback to the superhero movies released during the first decade of the 21st Century. While there were a few standouts like Spider-Man 2 and X2, there were far more duds. Many of the worst of these – Ang Lee’s Hulk, for example – quickly fell into a formula that Morbius follows almost to a T: A mad scientist experiments on himself, gets powers that leads him into trouble, until he encounters someone far worse and more power-hungry than him who uses the same powers for bad, they fight, etc. etc.  It certainly doesn’t help that Morbius’ friend-turned-arch-villain is named “Milo.” It’s great that bad guys these days don’t feel they need to use silly comic book code-names, but I have a hard time believing the filmmakers couldn’t do better than “Milo.” The truth is that Morbius probably would have worked far better if it just went for an R-rating. Trying to water down the needed blood splatter to get a PG-13 rating takes away from those horror aspects, which might allow parents to feel better about bringing their younger kids to see it (unlike The Batman) but anyone older than say 15 will likely be bored. On the positive side of things, the movie generally looks pretty good, but it’s also constantly leaning so hard on its VFX budget to try to make things look cooler than they actually are. They rarely help to make up for the fact that the story and writing aren’t solid enough to bolster them. Something that REALLY bothered me, but probably won’t bother others, is that this movie was obviously filmed a lot in the UK in place of New York. As someone who has spent a lot of time in both places, it bothers me that anyone might think the two places are so interchangeable.  As much as I was hoping to like Morbius more, because it isn’t a terrible movie – believe me, I’ve seen worse this week alone! – it constantly feels like the filmmakers had to work extra hard to make something out of a weak script that brings absolutely nothing new or original to a genre that’s been much improved in recent years. This might have been a terrific movie if it was still 2005, but it’s not, and no one has asked for this kind of throwback to when comic book movies were just so mediocre and forgettable. Rating: 5.5/10Note: There are two end credit tags that ham-handedly try to tie Morbius into other recent Sony Spider-movies. At this point, do we really even need a long-threatened Sinister Six movie after Spider-Man: No Way Home? I think not. "

"Mar 30, 2022",NEGATIVE," If Morbius were the first film in Sony’s Spider-Man Cinematic Universe, we’d be talking about it as the beginning and end of the franchise. It would be what The Mummy was to the Universal Monsters. Despite sitting on the shelf for two years, delayed largely because of COVID-19, the antihero film led by Jared Leto as the vampiric Michael Morbius is a complete misfire and a total bore, with the only real consistency being how consistently bad it is. This thing will suck the energy out of audiences faster than Morbius can drain a vial of artificial blood. Surprisingly, my beef with Morbius doesn’t extend to star Jared Leto, who is usually in my crosshairs for giving performances only he seems to understand. As Dr. Michael Morbius, , who suffers from a debilitating blood disorder, he’s actually quite dialed-back and reserved. Unfortunately, it’s in keeping with Leto to go against what the film actually requires but a more over-the-top, demonstrative performance would’ve helped liven up this dull film. Instead, the Leto wackiness is given over to co-star Matt Smith, who plays Morbius’ longtime friend, Lucius, although he’s derisively nicknamed Milo as a child, a name that sticks into adulthood. Born with the same blood disorder, Milo is envious when Morbius, a renowned doctor so rebellious he rejects a Nobel Prize because…*shrug*, why not, uses vampire bats to create an experimental cure. The side effect is a monstrous transformation and an unquenchable thirst for human blood. But at least he has cool sonar effects and can fly using air currents or something, plus speed, agility, and all that good stuff. The blood thirst is a problem, though; his artificial blood is dwindling and its effect are decreasing. Milo doesn’t care; he steals the serum from his friend and takes it, but rather than fighting the thirst he gives into it, becoming a killer of the innocent. It’s up to Morbius to take his former best friend down. The film is directed by Daniel Espinosa, whose spotty resume includes breakout crime flick Snabba Cash, followed by blockbuster Safe House, the forgettable Child 44, and the underrated sci-fi horror, Life. Speaking of which, there is absolutely no life to what Espinosa brings to the table. One groggy, inexplicably blue-tinged scene stumbles into the next. Action is at a minimum, especially unforgivable when you consider Tyrese Gibson co-stars as a cop with a friggin’ hi-tech arm. What fighting we do get is slowed down with shoddy CGI effects, made messier by vapor trails and other nonsense meant to dazzle. None of it does. Gibson isn’t the only co-star who goes to waste. Adria Arjona has little to do as Morbius’ colleague, friend, and love interest Martine Bancroft. Shockingly, Arjona has said the character is inspired by politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which should be like a slap in the face to the Congresswoman she’s so painfully underserved. At one point, the filim boasts scenes with Leto, Smith, and the always-great Jared Harris, and they are briefly a pleasure to watch. But ultimately, the level of talent is squandered by a script that has no direction, no passion, and no moments that make you want to see more of Morbius. Leto tries his best but he miscalculated his performance. And Smith, who recently admitted he doesn’t understand the movie or his character, has a perfectly evil dance number that comes out of nowhere and is the film’s one actual highlight. We don’t understand Milo or his motives and there is zero attempt to explain him. The hatred between him and Morbius goes straight from 0 to 60. All the film has to lean on are a handful of Easter Eggs, including one real eye-opener about a certain school in New York, but is even a tease of close MCU ties enough to build a Morbius franchise on? Sony will hope so, but I think the blood has been sucked dry out of this one before it ever really got started."
"Mar 30, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Morbius is a mostly unlikeable mess. The lowest bar any superhero movie has to clear, is that it should at least be fun to watch. Morbius falls at the first hurdle."
"Mar 30, 2022",NEGATIVE," Academy Award winner Jared Leto is Michael Morbius, a biochemist who mistakenly turns himself into a vampire, in this horror-tinged Marvel superhero blockbuster. As Liam Maguren grimly writes, perhaps we needed this film to remind us what a superhero waste of cinema space truly looks like. Moviegoers endure a love-hate relationship with superhero films. Crowds can’t get enough of them, as Spider-Man: No Way Home‘s box office domination showed. Others say they’re the slow death of cinema, a point made convincing when struggling theatre chains pulled screenings for Best Picture Oscar nominee Nightmare Alley in favour of the Marvel behemoth. Whatever your feelings are, we can all agree that the cinema space is precious. Perhaps we needed a film like Morbius to remind us what a superhero waste of cinema space truly looks like. After a run of eccentric acting choices, Academy Award-winning actor Jared Leto appears to be overcompensating with his flat interpretation of Michael Morbius. Originally a Marvel Spider-Man villain turned not-quite-anti-hero here, the biochemist’s search to cure his rare blood disease accidentally turns him into The Living Vampire. I can’t speak to how disabled audiences will feel about Leto’s pre-vampire performance as the disabled doctor, but the story’s at least wise enough to emphasise his intent to prevent his condition from killing him—not “cure” his disability. Unfortunately, the film’s not wise enough to have Leto react like a human being to his superhuman situation. He responds with mild interest in his ability to jump ten metres high; he responds with mild concern when learning he’s responsible for an innocent person’s death; every extreme is treated so mild in his eyes, nothing feels exceptional. It’s as if Leto’s character notes were “just do the cool vampire shit!” Adria Arjona (6 Underground) and Jared Harris (Chernobyl) co-star as fellow doctors Martine and Emil alongside Tyrese Gibson (F9) as Detective Simon Stroud. The roles are so thankless, they’re not worth writing about. Respectably, Matt Smith (The Crown) manages to inject some character into this as Morbius’ best mate Milo. You can imagine a better script that expanded his character and made him the lead. Sadly, we got this script, one that flirts with being an anti-hero tragedy only to break its back to make Morbius a faultless goody. The scene of his first transformation sees him kill a bunch of armed dudes in tension-free horror movie style, only to have any morally interesting Jekyll-and-Hyde consequences shuffled off stage by one line of dialogue. Then there’s the villain’s motivation, a reason so thin it wouldn’t pass the Rubber Ducky School of Drama. You can picture someone over the writers’ and editors’ shoulders during revisions yelling: “just get to the cool vampire shit!” There’s a two-hour long YouTube essay worth of stuff to say about the writing, editing, storytelling and acting in this film but screw it—let’s just get to the cool vampire shit. Well, it ain’t cool. It’s just shit. Especially the bizarre use of a smog SFX surrounding vampire Morbius. While it makes sense when visualising his “bat radar,” it makes no sense when he’s moving slightly faster than the average person. Worse still, it smears all the action scenes in a CG blanket of blur, occasionally doing a Zach Snyder-esque slow-mo to give the illusion of being comprehensible. When Morbius takes on his vampire counterpart in the climax, it just looks like a fight between two human-sized gas leaks. Add some disastrously dim lighting and a shaky cam that reads 9.0 on the Richter scale, and you’ve got one of the worst popcorn blockbuster experiences in recent memory."
