"Sep 12, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Having seen Bo in action on Imus, I had to watch this - you can get it on Netflix streaming.   Baldwin does a pretty good Bo impression - he brings the right 'amplitude' to the role, as Bo might  say - and it was fun to watch Chris Penn in action, too, may he rest in peace.   Worth watching when you feel like watching a New York cop movie that presses all the usual buttons."
"Aug 21, 2008",NEUTRAL,"great acting by Baldwin and Penn.
RIP Christopher Penn!"
"Jul 23, 2008",NEUTRAL,I can't remember ANYTHING about this one
"Jul 21, 2008",NEUTRAL,Aldrig har jeg grint sÃ¥ meget... det er bare synd det ikke er en komedie.
"Apr 29, 2008",NEUTRAL,"No review, this movie just kind of all over sucks. Although, if you want a funny/bad movie, this really fits the bill and earns two stars from me."
"Jan 2, 2008",NEUTRAL,This wasn't the worst movie in the world but Stephen Baldwin isn't the best actor in the world.
"Jun 13, 2007",NEUTRAL,Hahahahahahahaha. Oh was I not supposed to laugh?
"Jan 7, 2007",NEUTRAL,Sexy movie. Paul Guilfoyle is a pimp in dis movie. He has 2 women on the side of him and he's makin out with them one by one.

You don't love dragons???Oh, please? They are beautiful! Large and scaly, and have you seen all those posters featuring dragons? Wonderful colours! I usually buy those posters just because of the colours. But don't get me wrong; I really like dragons. Got one for Christmas. Or three, actually. Haven't named them yet, but I will.

Er...that is a temporary list. Might change my mind later. 
 
I saw ""The return of the king"" the other day, by the way. (Hey! Day-way! Heh heh...Yes, I know. I'm easily amused!) Anyway...where was I? Oh, yes. Return of the king. Did I like it? Yup. Did I love it? Naah. Too long. I'm sure Jackson couldn't make it any shorter without losing important bits, but... Hey, Mr jackson! Some of us need to pee once in a while, you know!:D Maybe longer movies should have a ""pee-pause"" in the middle, hm? Heh heh... At least at the cinemas. I mean, you don't want to run off just when Gollum's having a little fight with his other self, or when Frankenstein's monster is about to kiss a gorilla, or when Kevin Costner is kidnapped by aliens with pink tentacles. (Yeah, that's right! Why should they always be green, duh?:p If I were an alien, I'd be purple. Or maybe red. Or orange...)
 
Got to run now. See you!
 
PS. Did anybody see my dragon? I'm sure I put it here somewhere...
