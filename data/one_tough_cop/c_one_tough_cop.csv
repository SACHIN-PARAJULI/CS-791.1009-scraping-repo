"Jan 1, 2000",POSITIVE," Like many recent Ritchie movies, this one has a lot of frenetic action, a fair amount of spectacle, some cheeky dialogue, and a hefty dose of machismo. Designed to be corny and loopy but with a kernel of sentimentality at its core, and is sufficiently different to make it almost worth seeing for that reason alone. ""Civil War"" does a good job dissecting the damage done by a desensitization to violence but it botches the backstory and features an ending that belongs in another movie. The actors do what they can with underwritten roles but it is hard not to see that a lot more could have been developed from the premise. For those who have an orgasmic reaction to kaiju confrontations, far too little of the film is devoted to them and the overreliance on CGI leeches away the awe associated with the spectacle. It is at times unsettling and the ending contains a strong shock element but the movie as a whole feels a little too familiar to engage its audience."
"Jan 1, 2000",NEGATIVE," As the opening credits on ""One Tough Cop'' rolled, I made a bet with myself that the opening sequence would involve a hostage crisis. I lost. There was another short scene first, and then the hostage crisis. A tough cop named Bo Dietl (Stephen Baldwin) walks past the uniformed officers and confronts the madman who has taken his daughter hostage. Just like in dozens of other cop movies. Of course the hostage sequence must stand alone, and not have any attachment to the rest of the movie. OK, I'm thinking. What scene always follows a hostage scene in a cop movie? A bar scene. Cops drinking. I am correct. Dietl and his partner Duke (Chris Penn) are in a bar, while the movie establishes that Duke has drinking and gambling problems. (It's always a danger signal when your partner advises you to ""put something on your stomach.'') Then Dietl ends up at a birthday party for Richie La Cassa (Mike McGlone), his friend since kindergarten. Is Richie in the mob? (It's always a danger signal when your best friend has an uncle named Sal who travels with bodyguards.) I'm checking my Timex Indiglo, waiting to see how long it will take for the rogue cop to be called on the carpet by his superior. Answer: four minutes. ""Bo,'' says the chief, ""you're the best cop I have working for me, but, swear to God, you're your own worst enemy!'' Bo is confronted by two feds (Amy Irving and Victor Slezak), who show him photos of himself hugging his childhood buddy Richie at last night's party. In a dialogue scene so talky it brings the movie to a halt, they want him to turn rat and plant a bug on Richie. But Bo won't. The movie is filled with speeches in which he explains that these Mafia guys are his childhood friends from the old neighborhood. He'd see them on Sundays at church and never asked what they did for a living. Meanwhile, Duke continues to drink and gamble, and then the two cops happen upon a crime scene in which a nun has been raped and tortured. I'm counting down, five, four, three ... and sure enough, on two, we hear the obligatory line, ""What kind of an animal would do this?'' This Bo Dietl is apparently a real person, an ex-cop who reviews movies on the Don Imus radio program. ""One Tough Cop'' is based on a book that is somewhere between memoir and fiction. The movie ends with its only laugh, a title card that informs us: ""Except for the character of Bo Dietl, all characters and events in this movie are fictional.'' How real can a character be, you ask, in a totally fictional story? Think Michael Jordan in ""Space Jam.'' To the degree that Dietl's book does reflect events in his life, his life has been remarkable in incorporating all of the cliches of cop movies. There's even a noir heroine, Joey (Gina Gershon), whose purpose is to be backlit in slinky poses while making me wonder why this movie got released when her infinitely better work in the incomparably better murder-and-incest film ""This World, Then the Fireworks'' (1997) never got a theatrical run. The movie misses sure bets in scene after scene. Consider a confrontation in a bawdy house between Duke and Frankie ""Hot'' Salvano (Paul Guilfoyle), a mob gambling collector. ""Hot'' insultingly throws crumpled $100 bills at Duke, who boils over, smashes ""Hot'' against a table and stalks out. My best guess is that the hookers would immediately dive for the floor, butting heads in the scramble for the C-notes, but no. They just sit there, forgotten by the screenplay. The movie forgets lots of things. If you were Bo Dietl, for example, and had already been shown 8-by-10 glossies of yourself at a private birthday party with your mob friend Richie, would you select a table in the front window of a coffee shop as the ideal place to openly hand $5,000 in gambling debts to ""Hot''? That's professional suicide. Maybe Dietl is thinking, one tough cop is one tough cop too many. Roger Ebert was the film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times from 1967 until his death in 2013. In 1975, he won the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished criticism."
"Jan 1, 2000",POSITIVE,It's not one long series of gunfights and carefully choreographed car chases: it's a throwback to character-driven 1970s-era crime thrillers.

"Jan 1, 2000",NEGATIVE," Loosely based on the exploits of real-life NYPD cop Bo Dietl (who has of late been making the talk-show rounds with Baldwin in tow), this bloody, brawling, testosterone-heavy cop drama is a pure Seventies throwback: I kept waiting for Serpico to show his face, but Baldwin -- as Dietl -- apparently walks a different beat. Though rife with gritty urban realism, One Tough Cop is also one bad movie, wholly dependent on the hoary boys-in-blue clichÃ©s that make those Sansabelt Seventies so much retro fun today. Fists fly, perps flee, and Dietl and his partner Duke (Penn, bloated and unctuous) wage an uneasy war for their embattled streets. Big deal. As Barreto's film opens, Dietl and Duke are called in to a hostage situation involving a little girl and her estranged father. After much negotiating on Dietl's part (he sets aside his piece, he strips off his shirt, he does pretty much everything the NYPD manual advises officers not to do), the girl is released, shots ring out, and noted character actor Luis Guzman is spurting crimson. Dietl's flouting of the established rules lands him in the hot seat with Internal Affairs, but it's his longtime camaraderie with boyhood pal -- and mafioso -- Richie (McGlone) that interests the F.B.I. task force headed by an icy Agent Devlin (Irving, woefully out of place). Having grown up together on those fabled, Scorsesean mean streets, Richie and Dietl share a common bond and act more like brothers than workaday adversaries. Dietl, despite what I.A. and the F.B.I. think they know, has spent his eight years on the force keeping his nose scrupulously tidy; he may be a maverick, but his cash flow's squeaky clean. When a grisly, Bad Lieutenant-like nun-raping occurs, Dietl and Duke ignore the orders of their superior officer and go after the crackheads involved, which, of course, only adds to the ongoing intra-departmental chaos. Subplots involving Dietl's romancing of Richie's moll (Gershon) and Duke's unassuaged gambling debts (and $10,000 in parking violations) add to the general air of NYC malaise, though One Tough Cop is almost comedic in its reverent attitude toward this hulking, sweatshirted toughster. âYouse guysâ is actually uttered more than once in the film, and though there is no doubt that certain quarters of New Jersey and New York City still harbor such syntax-mangling Ã¼ber-hoods, its repetition elicits laughter more than sympathy for these duty-bound street creatures. Barreto does his best with what appears to have been a ridiculously macho script, but what he comes up with is 90 minutes of ham-handed neo-goofiness. Honor, loyalty, and all the other supposed virtues of the street still have their place, but One Tough Cop just makes them feel like so much Fifth Avenue window-dressing.

"Jan 1, 2000",NEUTRAL," 
We see this kind of gritty urban cop drama on TV all the time (""NYPD Blue""), but this highly-fictionalized, cliche-riddled cop bio is more USA Network than it is Steven Bochco. When thick-neck Brooklynite Bo Dietl was a New York City plain-clothes policeman, his life was apparently an endless series of gritty cop cliches.
Dietl is a real guy, a retired badge who wrote a semi-autobiographical novel which has been turned into a movie, ""One Tough Cop,"" starring Stephen Baldwin. But apparently the autobiographical elements of his life didn't make for good drama. A disclaimer precedes the closing credits that reads (I'm paraphrasing here), with the exception of the character of Bo Dietl, almost everything in this movie is fictitious.
Fictitious, overworked, recycled and shopworn.
In the picture, a beefed-up Baldwin (he gained 30 pounds, a few tattoos and an accent for the role) slogs through untold episodes seeming salvaged from the ""Hill Street Blues"" cutting room floor: Dietl is ordered off a case and investigates anyway. His partner (Chris Penn) is a drunk with huge gambling debts, but, of course, a noble cop nonetheless. His girlfriend was recently his best friend's girlfriend (insert ""we gotta talk"" scene here), and she says things like ""Well, well, well, Dietl. I was wondering when you'd show up.""
Naturally, Dietl's interrogation style is to bust up a suspect's apartment and push him violently back into his chair every time he jumps up saying ""Hey, man, I don't know nuthin'!""
You get the idea.
That disclaimer about it all being made up came as quite a relief, but I wish it had been at the beginning of the movie, because it was hard not to smirk and roll my eyes while watching scenes lifted from a hundred B-grade cop movies being passed off as a true story.
Here's the stuff that is real: Dietl really did grow up with a guy who became a mob operative (played here by Mike McGlone from ""The Brothers McMullen"" and ""She's The One""), and their continued friendship begot all kinds of trouble for Dietl, including an investigation by Internal Affairs and the FBI. Also, Dietl helped solve the brutal rape and murder of a nun. And, based on the way Baldwin plays him in the movie, I wouldn't be surprised if Dietl really did drive a gold Trans Am.
Pretty much everything else -- the opening sequence hostage situation that Dietl resolves single-handedly, the scene cradling the bullet-riddled body of his dead partner in an dark intersection (oops, did I let that slip?) -- was invented (or, more accurately, pilfered) by either Dietl the novelist  or Jeremy Iacone, the screenwriter, and it's excruciatingly obvious.
And, by the way, what is with that title?
""One Tough Cop"" shows promise when its focus is on the semi-factual. Baldwin and McGlone have an old-neighborhood chemistry that lends the cop-mob guy relationship some real chops and cogent conflict.
But the movie isn't about that relationship. It's not about the nun case either, although his determination to find the perps responsible stirs Baldwin's strongest and least pre-fabricated emotions. It's just about this one tough cop who is no more or less interesting than all the tough movie cops that have come before him.
