"Apr 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"Absolutely phenomenal, could not give a higher recommendation to a modern animated film."
"Apr 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"A mastery of pacing and animation. Movie tuckles havy themes like batteling over ones mortality, looking for happiness and forming meaningfull relationships. Big Jack Horner felt a bit over the top and not really necessery, but this movie is forever great to rewatch. Too bad it's the only really good movie Dream Works made in reacent days, and it might just be only good sequeal they made. I mean, there's Shrek, but I didn't really enjoy it, and haven't watched it since, so"
"Apr 10, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie was entertaining for the kids and the adults alike. The characters were interesting and the animation was beautiful.
"Apr 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is the decade-later sequel to a spinoff franchise and yet, it is the best movie in the Shrek franchise. That's no small feat when it has to match up against Shrek 2. Everything about this movie pushes the boundaries on how we view animated family movies. From a message about coming to terms with our own mortality to humor that doesn't talk down to its viewers. With 3 different kinds of antagonists, the movie is able to make sure none are too hot or too cold, striking that balance of just right across the board. Even a character like Perro, who you would expect to be the annoying comedic relief, is a fun side character who contributes to the themes and flow of the story. This movie was an incredible surprise that ensures that Puss will always be our favorite fearless hero."
"Apr 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"A very fun sequel that delivers unlike megamind 2. A fun, colorful, great story family film for all to enjoy."
"Apr 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"Given the movies that directly followed this, I'm convinced that Dreamworks didn't make this."
"Apr 5, 2024",POSITIVE,Nooo way This Movie Sooo AMAZING!!!
"Apr 3, 2024",NEUTRAL,every time jack was on screen it bored me unfortunately the hype didn't go as what i thought this movie would of been the wolf character bc of puss in boots last life i really like but he is barley in this movie unfortunately this movie is disappointing but i enjoyed it when it came to the very beginning and the 3rd act but the second act is boring bc jack wants a wish just for him to be so powerful bad motivation 82%
"Apr 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"Beauty of a movie, with amazing character growth and the designs are so GORGEROUS, i love the backgrouns and every little frame, the frame drops in fights are so so SO good we need more movies like this"
"Mar 31, 2024",POSITIVE,Honestly peak dream works that took a smaller character and made an absolutely amazing story line. The characters were all enjoyable and the comedic relief wasn't an annoying side character who serves no purpose to the story. He actually had a character and felt like an important part of the team.
"Mar 30, 2024",POSITIVE,This was an amazing movie 100% better than the 1st one
"Mar 30, 2024",POSITIVE,"A sequel to Puss in Boots being considered a cinematic masterpiece is a shocker and I absolutely agree. Everything from the incredible animation, to the compelling story  and the amazing performance from the voice actors. It's a non stop ride of action, emotion, comedy and I can't stress enough how amazing this film is. Chefs kiss and I hope this is the direction Dreamworks goes for Shrek 5."
"Mar 29, 2024",POSITIVE,"This film is fantastic in every way. The animation is beautiful, the comedy is spectacular and the movie is scary, funny, sad and exciting at the same time.

All the characters are so fun and unique. Everyone is giving it their all and it is incredible.

There are a lot of cameos from other character out of the Shrek franchise that are very fun to see on the big screen again.

There are great surprises sprinkled throughout that will excite and entertain you.

Last but not least this film has a surprising amount of dark moments and a wolf character that will maybe scare you.

Overall the movie is awesome .

If you want a movie for the whole family to watch and enjoy in the theater then this one is perfect."
"Mar 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots returns for a sequel with the hugest bang possible. With a whole new animation design that resembles closely to Spiderverse & TMNT, the last wish made every fan rejoiced with it's sense of humour and amazing choreography matching to none. The film succeeded in doing something what Dreamworks is known for, targeting at mature audiences. With topics as death, depression, etc, it really is a dreamworks writing through and through. The film's major bonus point is the addition of most beloved fairy tale characters and showing their darker and gritty sides which really puts a new perspective in the minds of people who have grown up watching such titles. The story explores the last life of Puss which really puts a spin on what it means to live a life knowing there is no coming back. 
All in all,  a great film that made me love Dreamworks even more & hopeful in the future installments.

PROS:
-	Amazing Cinematography and Animation.
-	Great Villain and characters arc.
-	A complete and unique story.
CONS:
-	Some story points that feels to repetitive of the first movie but still blends in really well."
"Mar 28, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Let's go with the minuses - I was surprised by the level of violence portrayed in the movie at times. It's also quite loomingly scary, with the characters of Wolf (played by Wagner Moura) and ""Big"" Jack Horner (John Mulaney) being very violent. Wolf also occupies a very weird place in the film - I remained unclear if he was supposed to be a representation of death or death itself. The new animation style was interesting but didn't really seem to serve a real purpose except for it being there.

However, these are quite minor, and the movie itself is quite well put together, with logical reasons for each of the characters to look for the wish (maybe except Kitty, but it's a small thing in the grand scheme of things). Perrito (voiced by Harvey Guillen) and Goldilocks (played by she's-everywhere Florence Pugh) are interesting additions to the storyline. The humour is also quite well done (though again might fly over the kids' heads), and it was an enjoyable movie. 

Overall, a good movie, though keep it for the older kids."
"Mar 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great movie just everything the voice actors, the animation, highly recommend"
"Mar 27, 2024",POSITIVE,"Epic animation, epic music, epic story, and epic comedy! If you haven't seen the movie yet, THEN WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? GO SEE IT NOW!!!"
"Mar 27, 2024",POSITIVE,"A hero fallen from grace, going through a midlife crisis as he realizes he's aging and death (the wolf) is getting closer and closer. The Shrek fairy tail universe is expanded upon, introducing a whole plethora of new fun characters, subplots to keep you invested, and excellent animation and voice acting."
"Mar 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie is definitely one of the best DreamWorks films. The cinematography, animation, voice acting and humour was just all fantastic. This might be the next best film from DreamWorks since How to Train Your Dragon."
"Mar 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"vivo por ese final, asombroso"
"Mar 26, 2024",POSITIVE,Fun movie. Whole family loved it. Little taco dog was funny and cute.
"Mar 25, 2024",POSITIVE,"Show this to adults and kids, animation is a medium, so is this movie. Something for everyone to enjoy here"
"Mar 25, 2024",POSITIVE,woooooooooooooooooooooo
"Mar 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie is multidimensional and goes beyond what the trailer shows. An exceeding of expectation no doubt, and definitely not just for kids!"
"Mar 23, 2024",POSITIVE,"Perfect movie, a complete animated movie in animation, plot, characters and humor"
"Mar 21, 2024",POSITIVE,It's long time ago that I've seen such a great movie. The animation looks amazing and clearly took some inspiration from into the Spider verse. I can listen hours to the beautiful music. The voice cast is great and I better characters are almost not possible. The storyline is amazing and is focusing on really dark subjects you usually don't see in animated movies. But it still has laughs and cute moments so this is still one of the best movies I've ever seen.
"Mar 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie is a Chad....🗿🍷
DreamWorks>>>>> Disney"
"Mar 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"It's rare to see a sequel outshine everything else that's in theaters.  The concept that Puss was on his last life, and tried to give up his adventures, only to be brought back by friends for one last adventure, was incredibly well done.  The new characters were well written, thought out, and voiced over.  Although Puss is brought somewhat low by his predicament, he's never made to look weak, and his many strengths still shine throughout the film.  The new villains added an amazing contrast to the entire movie, again, written in a compelling way with really well done voice actors.  The movie occasionally switches to a different type of 'painted' animation for story telling.  This was well executed and not overdone.  All around, this was well worth the theater tickets."
"Mar 20, 2024",POSITIVE,All right Nah! Amazing!
"Mar 19, 2024",POSITIVE,What an amazing peace of art !
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"really good, i love the story and the animation"
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,One of my absolute favorites!!
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Explores quite an unsaturated area in movie design and makes the idea of mortality extremely approachable to the younger audience through many funny scenes, which further dramatize the climax of the movie. A huge visual overhaul compared to the movie's predecessor"
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, like a breath of fresh air!"
"Mar 14, 2024",POSITIVE,this movie is amasing to whatch as a family on a friday and its a masterpiece. and this movie is good and all
"Mar 13, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great Movie! 10 times better than the first movie. this movie is about Puss trying to find a star that will let him wish for all of his 9 lives back. Near the end of the movie puss starts to value the last life he has left. The villains of the movie are amazing. 
10/10"
"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"Suprisingly the great sequel, great plot, and the one of the best Villain"
"Mar 11, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's pretty good and I would recommend it but it's really annoying that Hollywood consistently use the Old cliché of cockney aka British working class accent for ""crude"" antagonists, too much class snobbery which is not healthy for a young audience."
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Best Dreamworks movie i have ever seen. Both in terms of story and animation.
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't this. I was completely blown away by this film. Finally, something critics and audiences agreed on!"
"Mar 7, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie is so good and for no reason
"Mar 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"Excelente, maravilhoso, espetáculo."
"Mar 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"Pretty good Dreamworks movie, not too many complaints"
"Mar 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"the animation was choppy, which i like, and the plot was also nice.
overall, the movie was good!"
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a great and enjoyable Movie. The story was great, the villains were good, it's a great movie for the Shrek Franchise and good to see that Shrek was in the movie. It's a great sequel and one of my favorites, I can't wait for Shrek 5"
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,PUSS IN BOOTS IS AMAZING! I watched this movie with my kids in January 2023 and oh boy was this a complete banger. The movie is really intresting about how puss is on his last life and needs to go to the wishing star and make his wish to get back his nine life's back (since he's only on one more life left). And lets not forget about the best dreamworks villlain of all time DEATH. Death is the best dreamworks villain its literally no competition. But jokes aside all the characters are really fun to watch not like the last puss in boots movie. And the animation is splendid aswell its just really good. But yeah this is a really attractive movie. And I know I was really late on reviewing it I just needed more time to think about what's good.
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie is great for everyone even grandma even tho she is dead, this movie is high quality animations and real models the voice actors are better and the story is amazing, and reason why i wouldn't give a 5 star because not all movies are perfect"
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,My favorite Dreamworks movie/sequel and my 2nd favorite movie ever.
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,God I have no words for this masterpiece!!
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,One of the best animated movies in recent memory. It harkens back to Pixar's golden days. Absolutely recommend for any and all ages with its slick animation for kids and story tackling mature themes for adults.
"Feb 20, 2024",POSITIVE,Tuve la oportunidad de verla después de que salió y que todo internet la pusiera en tik tok en Facebook en donde sea pero está película o mejor dicho secuela es algo en donde Dreamworks acertó con el gato con botas al hacer algo divertido y entretenido pasa la Audiencia no solo la animación es hermosa si no cada detalle y personajes introducidos son algo especiales en cierto modo
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Rarity these days to see movie that kids and adults can both enjoy. This shrek spinoff should be the blueprint for other studios for how to make smart animated movies.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,I really enjoyed the movie and watching this made me even more excited for what's to come from Dream Works! It's entertaining and a fun watch.
"Feb 13, 2024",POSITIVE,"A Masterpiece, I don't need to say any more"
"Feb 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"I think it could've easily been a 4.5 or a 5 if it didn't spoonfeed a lot of the morals at the end. Like the message was very clear but they chose to make the characters spoonfeed you the moral making it less impactful. Amazing movie regardless, the humor and the story was nice. I think my favorite part are the scenes where Puss is afraid of Death. These moments truly made the movie special."
"Feb 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"The writing in this movie is outstanding, the cinematographic techniques they used was so involving and well done that I felt impressed, the characters, all of them with a great story and reasoning behind their actions, marvelous, the best animation movie I've seen this past years."
"Feb 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie is absolutely spectacular.  The storytelling, the voices, the incredible little bits of detail we see as we watch it beyond our first time, it's all just spectacular.  And Jack Horner was a huge breath of fresh air for just being a purely evil villain with no sympathetic backstory or anything.  But I think Perrito has to be my favorite character.  He's absentminded, but not dumb.  Talkative, but not annoying.  And he's the sweetest soul you could ever come across.  I can not praise this movie enough for any category."
"Feb 6, 2024",POSITIVE,Como alguém não consegue gostar desse filme?
"Feb 4, 2024",POSITIVE,really good best movie dreamworks ever made watch it
"Feb 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie is awesome! Fresh animation, good jokes, loveable characters and menacing villains!"
"Feb 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Masterpiece. One of the best movies I've ever watched. The plot, the animation, the characters, the jokes. Everything is perfect. The story has such great characters and I love how not all of them are redeemable. It has a variety of villains, each with their own personality. Some pure villains, and some not. The plot is amazing and the character development is perfect. Watch this movie."
"Feb 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Animation that in its narrative we have nothing new, but it is so well done that laughing, crying, getting excited, moved, afraid, reflecting and vibrating are natural reactions when watching it. And if it is ""simplistic"" in its story, the Photography is SPECTACULAR(!), being a real eye candy! A sequel to the 2011 film that surpasses it and is worthy of an Oscar, a feat that only Puss in Boots can achieve. your last wish could be fulfilled. Miauuu!"
"Feb 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Plot-wise, I don't think any movies will ever touch the early Pixar movies again...toy story, incredibles, monsters inc., I don't think it's possible. But this was one of the best kid movies I've seen in a long time, very entertaining."
"Jan 25, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie has explaining that Puss in Boots is awesome movie that similar sequel to Spider-Verse.
"Jan 23, 2024",POSITIVE,One of the best films made by Dream works. I had a lot of fun watching it.
"Jan 12, 2024",POSITIVE,such a beautiful movie every scene was created with the best writer in the world
"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"Everyone was saying how surprisingly good this movie was. I believed them only to an extent as I am someone who finds the first Puss in Boots movie underrated. But then, I finally saw this movie and was utterly flawed. I was desperately trying to find a flaw in this movie but I just couldn't. 

So weird to think that a Puss in Boots movie might just be my favourite movie of this decade so far."
"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Very silly and fun. The dog character was the best comic relief character I've seen in a very long time.
"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Puss in boots gets a beard. Thats enough to get you to watch it
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"Full of excitement, humor, and heart. What a great story with charming characters! Excellent voice acting and singing."
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great movie with an interesting lovable villain.
Perrito is so cute and innocent throughout the movie, I love it. Kitty and Puss's love-hate relationship was also fun to sit through as well."
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"Spectacular, hilarious, and heartfelt to boot (pun intended), Puss in Boots: The Last Wish proves that there's still plenty of lives in the Shrek franchise."
"Jan 7, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Much better movie than that horrible egg that was the 1st. Very nice script that entertains all audiences and very good quality graphics, Kung Fu Panda style. And there is an interesting open ending."
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"Best sequel ever in any dreamworks movie, they really out did themselves!!!!"
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was the best movie with the most awesome story and exceptional character developement
The bad remains the best and most horrifying villain i have ever see"
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,Animation and storyline are amazing
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,I previously said the the 1st Puss in Boots need Shrek or Donkey to make it worth wild.  There just wasn't anything there to grab onto.  This film however was amazing and it stood all on its own.  All the characters were great and Funny.  I highly recommend.
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"Well designed and animated. This Puss in Boots sequel is emotional, wholesome and terrifying. But what convinces me of the film's high quality are the depth of rhe characters and their conflicts."
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"I didint expected this movie to be soo goodd, loved perrito"
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"An instant classic, I've seen this movie 6 times in the year since it's been out. Genuinely one of my new favorite animated movies, Everything is so beautifully animated and every character is so awesome… and the message… holy cow it's so powerful. AMAZING movie."
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"An actually really good movie, 93-95%"
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Best Shrek movie imo
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Perfection. This movie is so enjoyable, the animation is incredible, everything. The plot is well constructed, as well as other characteristics such as characters, writing, etc. A must see if you like Dreamworks movies or overall animated movies!"
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"An animated MASTERPIECE!  One of the best animated films to come out of Dreamworks.  Animators should study this this one.  Everything about it was jaw droppingly well executed from the writing to the characters to the animation itself.  And this possibly has the greatest villain of all time seen in any movie, live action or animated."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,Uma das melhores animações!!
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,i love this movie so mush
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful movie, beautiful animation, such a scary antagonist in an animated film I love it"
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"I want to say it's not as good as people say it is, but thinking about it there are no flaws! The music, the villains, the scenery, 👌"
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie has a amazing plot, and amazing animation. I love it so much"
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"A very good sequel, as usual with DreamWorks. Both its archetypal villain and its main antagonist are excellent and the development of Antonio Banderas' character (puss in boots) was very good. I would watch it over and over again."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie, from the setting to the characters everything was perfect. It is a must watch movie and my best movie of the year so far."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Easily one of the best Disney movies
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Arguably, the most compelling and heartfelt animated movie packed with a great and jaw-dropping villain."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Undeniably one of the greatest kids movies ever made
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Thos movie is just heart warming wirh beloved characters that do not disappoint.  The story is sweet, with a Gillian that is despicable.  Definitely must watch."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,i think my favourite movie of all time
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: the Last Wish offers some great cameos from very recognizable faces and some of DreamWorks' best ever villains, it is one of the best animated films in DreamWorks canon.

9/10"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"A movie with so much passion and soul that isn't afraid to hit the feels in all the right ways. It's excellent themes along with it's fun and lovable cast, be it good or evil or everything in between, you'll find someone to enjoy throughout the movie. Quirky and charmo, yet deep and emotional, this movie might be a rollercoaster for you. Truly a masterpiece and an easy top 3 in the Shrek franchise. I'll always consider this a classic and a must watch if you haven't."
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie takes the cake i love it so much with all character developments with puss try to get his wish but in the end he chose to keep his last life and make new adventures I love the giant fight that was thrilling to see
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It's was (in my opinion) the best movie of both 2022 and 2023.
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is iconic from the casting and the animation and of course you can't forget the humor
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"they killed it with this one, legit how is it so good—"
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Puss in boot is really my greatest fearless hero.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie's incredible elements of surprising characterization, colors, and writing was an outstanding piece of art. It provides incredible character quality and quantity, the life lesson it gives, and unique development of each character, especially the protagonist. 

With this, this an amazing and successful film made by Dreamworks. I look forward to the many films up to plan like Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Death is terrifying tbh
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is probably one of the best DreamWorks production movies to come to light, and possibly the best of them all. The animation is cartoonishly amazing, with inspiration from the Spider-Verse Series. The Humor is amazing, like one of the subversion roots of Shrek, one of the things the Shrek Franchise will do right. Overall, a 9.7/10. Action scenes, Characters, Humor, folktale elements, and The Villains,  were absolutely enjoyable, and I don't have that much complaints about this movie. And even then, the flaws are snuffed out with more enjoyable scenes."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is awesome. It has great sword fights, great characters, a great story, but most of all, a great villain. It's debatable on whether the villain is Goldilox for lying, Big  Jack Horner for selfishness, or Death for scaring Puss to death. Literally. But, the only one to get punished was Big Jack, so a lot of people think it's him. But I disagree. I think Death is the villain because he is awesome! Just like the movie. There are some corny bits, which is why I'm giving it only four stars. Some senes I didn't approve of, like the posey scene, or the river scene. I really don't think it's romantic to give someone a haircut. I mean seriously?! Couldn't DreamWorks come up with something a bit more romantic?! But, other than those two scenes, the movie is pretty good, so if you haven't watched it, than you should."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it.. tied with Sherk part 1 in the sherk universe... awesome animation and surprisingly great storyline. Loooooved it🥰
"Dec 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well, This Was An Entertaining Sequel. I Went To See This With My Brother, &amp His Friends At Cinemark. It Was Funny &amp Badass. The Characters Are Cool, Cute, &amp Funny, Especially Peritto. The Villains Are Amazing. This Is Another Ultimate Example Of How To Make A Sequel Good. This Movie Is Definitely Fabulous From Start-Finish. I'm Waiting For A 3-Quel. I Need To Rewatch The 1st To See Which Is Better. Well, That's Pretty Much My Salute. Time To Rate It.

RATING: Fabulous Movie (100/100). If Looking For An Advice &amp You Wanna See A Fabulous Animated Sequel, I Recommend Watch This Movie."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great villians, Great character development, and loved the growth you get see in the Protagonist.  Who better to describe this movie than Puss himself: ""He was known across the land by many names. The Stabby Tabby. El Macho Gato. The Leche Whisperer. To some, an outlaw. To more, a hero. To all, a legend. I was right. Words were not enough""

The three bears made me laugh, and brought back that feeling I had back in the original Shrek and Shrek 2.  Playing on words and their whole story."
"Dec 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I watch the first one and was disappointed with it so much that I delay watching this sequel. Well to my delight this is what I expected the first one to be like, it has great plot, characters and modern animations. I hope that the next installment of this franchise whether from the main or side one such as this continues on this formula as its great!."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand why wasn't this nominated for Best Picture. It is an excellent movie not only being serious, but also fun and full of suspense."
"Dec 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in boots: the last wish is awesome! The style gives you a sort of spiderman into the spiderverse vibe, with a comic book sort of mix of 2d and 3d and pretty colors and scenery! It was really funny, detailed, and at some parts a little scary, and better than the first one. This movie goes hard and you should watch it now"
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Yes!!! Animation is Amazing! Story is Brilliant! Best DreamWorks film to be released in ages!
"Nov 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The overall plot is not something to be dazzled by. It's the characters that make it extraordinary. Once again, cutting down on the whole parody aspect but scaling up on maliciousness and a much darker tone."
"Nov 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Tbh, I liked the first one way more. Ofc was it important for dreamworks to make the movie friendly for kids but it was too childish for the movie. The first one was also rlly cool for adults as well. Also the animations are rlly weird compared to the first movie."
"Nov 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honest shocked at how good it was, after Shrek 4 I wasn't really expecting much...
I was blown away at the quality of the animation, the story and the character development.

I've re-watched it several times, just brilliant."
"Nov 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is so good I don't even know what to say.Oh yeah, death was the most epic character in the entire movie, despite his super low screen time."
"Nov 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun family movie. The animation is very good. It is not only for kids, Adults can also watch this movie. Go and watch the movie!"
"Nov 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing Story. I must see for every age
"Nov 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Clever, well thought out characters, and compelling story."
"Nov 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I could go on for hours about this film. The soundtrack, the fresh writing, the boundaries broken, the stylistic choices, the tasteful handling of anxiety…this movie is perhaps the best animated film I've ever seen. Just watch it!!!"
"Nov 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think the plot has served its purpose. While the animation itself is great, its handling of the topic of death may not be appropriate for many audiences."
"Nov 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was actually pretty good. I wasn't really too sure of what it was when I went to see it with my little brother, but it was solid. It has some awesome animation and action, and the villain is cool."
"Nov 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such an unexpected surprise. I didn't mean to see this but I am so glad I did. Amazing characters, deep meaningful themes, and some of the best villains I have seen in years. All of this combined with fun animation to produce one of my favorite animated movies of all time."
"Nov 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Outstanding, the story, visuals and meaning of the story is awesome."
"Nov 18, 2023",POSITIVE,An amazing kids action packed movie. A must watch could watch for hours. The movie starts with an amazing introduction and an energetic start to finish. This movie does not have any boring parts just Turley amazing.
"Nov 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It is pretty much a perfect movie that can be enjoyed by kids and adults. There is a wolf character who is actually really dark and badass. But the main villan big jack Horner really holds the movie back from 5 stars.
"Nov 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible animation, actually good animation, and they have legit villians."
"Nov 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"This has been one of my favorite movies for a year now since it came out,  it has animation and visuals that are very pleasing to the eye and an excellent story. I'm not up to date on PussBoot lore and the past movies, so I'm not sure if it's accurate to the story or not, but I think it's really good."
"Nov 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Screw it this is a great masterpiecec and I really like this movie.

This isn't my favorite Dreamworks movie but it's a masterpiece and I care for it more."
"Nov 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,Meh I mean it's alright but I loved Jack Horner
"Nov 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was ... PERFECT !!!! 
So refreshing ! 

It's hard to write about this movie without spoils but really everything is perfect. The voices, the animations AND the SCRIPT ! 
For kids it's more than perfect. And for the 'grown kids' it's even better haha 
Bravio !"
"Nov 11, 2023",POSITIVE,It is just God tier!
"Nov 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is just perfect in every possible way. The music, the art style, the characters. the plot, the animation. Whenever the frame rate drops, you literally see the best parts of the movie! Also, can we just talk about the villain? Death the Wolf is literally the best Dreamworks villain of all time and It's literally no contest! Before watching this movie, I didn't pay to much attention, but now having seen it, this is the greatest movie in history! If you have never watched this movie, you need to watch this movie RIGHT NOW!"
"Nov 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This Movie is Glorious 

The Characters and Their Arcs are Amazing, Enjoyable, and likeable. The Animation is God Tier like Spider Verse.  The Fight scenes are great, and The Music is great. And the lessons about appreciating the life you have instead of using it and throwing your past behind you is amazing.

It's my favorite animated movie of all time."
"Nov 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"I personally believe this movie is great I love all of the different styles of animation it's similar to spider verse and mutant mayhem. I love the villians and there separate personalities. I think goldilocks and the bears had a great ark and were very thought out characters. Jack Horner had me dying while watching this movie he was so funny always talking about ruling the planet. And last but not least death was one of the best villians in any movie I have ever watched. Even with deaths small aperance in the movie he built fear. The movie can portray this in the beginning; when puss defeats a giant it shows how strong he is but as soon as he meets death and death makes a threat it makes the audience think puss will win. When puss ends out not winning and even getting scraped it puts a sense of fear into the audience and puss. It in general makes deaths presence so unsettling, from his non blinking eyes to him being everywhere at once death is a great villian. Puss is puss and kitty is kitty I forgot the dogs name but he was great and was hilarious."
"Nov 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you're a fan of adventure, humor, and daring heroes, then Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is the movie for you! This film takes everything we love about the swashbuckling feline and adds a new layer of depth and emotion to his story.

The animation is absolutely stunning, with vibrant colors and beautifully rendered landscapes that transport you right into the world of Puss in Boots. The voice acting is superb, with Antonio Banderas once again bringing his signature charm and wit to the character of Puss. And the supporting cast, including the sly and cunning Big Bad Wolf, are all perfectly cast and bring their own unique flair to the story.

But what really sets Puss in Boots: The Last Wish apart is the emotional journey that our hero goes on. We see him struggle with the consequences of his adventurous lifestyle and confront his own mortality in a way that is both heartwarming and thought-provoking. And yet, even in the face of his own mortality, Puss never loses his sense of humor or his indomitable spirit.

Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a five-star adventure that will leave you on the edge of your seat in tears but with a smile on your face. Whether you're a long-time fan of the series or just looking for a fun and exciting family movie, this one is not to be missed!"
"Nov 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"By far the best family movie I watched in years. My family and I enjoyed every minute and, in the end, felt a full sensation of goodness and satisfaction. I couldn't recommend it more."
"Nov 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"I can't complain, this is a masterpiece. I am blown away. 10 outta 10 movie!"
"Nov 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film is an exciting thrill ride of a film that your whole family will enjoy. This film is a fun adventure across the Shrek universe that has lots of references to the Original Shrek films. The story is action packed and fast paced with lots of fun and interesting references to old fairy tales like Pinocchio, little Jack Horner and goldilocks and the three bears. This will make teenagers reflect on their childhoods and feel nostalgic. Also, the adventure that our main characters take it will keep you on the edge of your seat as they go on a long journey to get to the dark forest and then traverse that forest which is a new and colourful location. this movie has some outstanding characters such puss in boots. He is a fun, funny and a complex character who at first doesn't take care of his lives, until he learns at the end of the film why you should spend your life in the best way you can. alongside puss we have kitty soft paws who wants the wish to find someone who she can trust. Perito is a fun sidekick that helps kitty and puss get their wishes without magic. Goldilocks learns an important lesson about family. She tells her bear family that she wants a real family instead of living in a family of bears. But she learns that she should love the family she has. with the art style in this film are taking a lot of inspiration from one of my favourite movies of all time called Spiderman into the Spidey verse. This film has an art style similar to comic book and the main character of the film miles loves comics so it also kind of fits with the movie. Back to Puss in boots, the visual look is done with a paint brush which makes this movie look aesthetically pleasing to its audience. Now on to the music, every single song fits the theme of the scene that you are watching. It goes from the banger opening with the song fearless hero, to the wolfs whistling theme which is ominous and adds a level of fear to this mysterious wolf. This is why the art and music of this film makes it stand out significantly to the over films DreamWorks has released over the years. Overall this film is worth a watch 9/10"
"Nov 5, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was very nice and quality and had a smooth and cartoony animation style. The villains were good and a nice refresher from the new rule that villans have to have a sad back story and a possibly redeeming factor about them. Had a nice story and a very cool ending.
"Nov 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is far better than it had the right to be. This is the sixth movie in the Shrek franchise. It's a sequel to a spin-off. And yet I found myself laughing more than I have since Shrek 2. The animation is vibrant & colorful, and the action sequences are highly energetic. It's obvious that the animators took good notes while watching Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek Pinault do a good job, as per usual, but newcomers Harvey Guillén, Florence Pugh, and John Mulaney gave memorable performances, as well. It seems that Puss really is a legend."
"Oct 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hilarious movie with a few fun twists and turns

Watched it 3 times so far😅"
"Oct 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Una película que nos hace demostrar que DreamWorks cuando tiene que hacer buenas películas y excelentes secuelas..... Lo hace con creces y este film lo demuestra de principio hasta su final. Película muy pero muy bien Animada, excelentes villanos y vaya que excelentes desarrollos de personajes tan bien fundamentados en esta historia que no me sorprende que este film hay asido nominado al Oscar y estuvo a unos centímetros de ganarse la presea máxima."
"Oct 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Christ! This movie slaps! How is this a movie sequel to a movie 1,000x worse than this! If I had to sum this movie up in one word it would be 'beautiful' in this movie, puss is on his last life (caz cats have 9 lives) so he goes to a wishing star to wish for 9 More lives but on the way he encounters 8 people, kitty soft paws (returning from the original) perito, goldilocks and the 3 bears crime family, jack horner(pure evil) and the one and only, death, yes you heard me, the embodiment of death, he is so cool! His spine chilling whistle scares puss making his runaway scenes so spine chilling but I think he was just trying to tell puss that respect his life because it won't last forever, also, jack horner is just to evil, he deserved is defeat, 2nd best movie of 2022"
"Oct 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of 2022. DreamWorks > Disney.
"Oct 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Me and my family enjoyed watching this movie a lot. It is filled with the most fun jokes ever seen.
"Oct 29, 2023",POSITIVE,I really love puss in boots why didn't like about it is the animation when I got to the fighting sequence as I didn't like that it was like they could've just kept the same information that they were using the entire time of the movie I love you with the cat lady you know she was like you're a basic cat lady but towards like towards the end of her scenes she was really funny I really liked her I wouldn't mind one more background story she said she was like that was her first time of piano in and she said her cats can play better than I was like I don't know her story that was like my two problems with the movie but I loved it it was funny he was creative I love all the characters the storyline was awesome amazing 5 star ⭐️ ⭐️ 💫 🌟 ⭐️ I am really excited about sherk 5 how it ended
"Oct 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was great, but I felt myself get a little bored for some parts"
"Oct 28, 2023",POSITIVE,I went into the cinema expecting to see a funny movie about a kitten wearing boots and I left with philosophical thoughts in my head.
"Oct 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"PIB 2 (Puss in Boots 2 aka ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"") is an absolute must-see. From the opening song describing our fearless hero all the way to the end of the film at the site of the wishing star, PIB 2 left me laughing and crying and feeling everything in between. This sequel to a spin-off of a sequel to the original Shrek movie had me laughing and crying. How did this happen? The characters were extremely memorable for one. ""Big Jack Horner"" was a great intentionally one-dimensional villain and the character of ""Death"" was truly terrifying. The comic relief, Perrito, a small abandoned puppy, stole the show. This movie would have been pretty good with out Perrito, but with Perrito it was great. One of the best scenes in the movie had to have been when Puss is having a incredibly realistic panic attack and Perrito is able to do what he's always wanted to do-- be a therapy dog for his friend. This substance in storytelling wasn't the only thing that made this movie great. It's style was also phenomenal. Based on the style of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, this film dazzles with its color palette, direction, and dropped frame rate during key moments of intensity. But by far, the great element of this movie was just how funny and entertaining it was! PIB 2 is a must-see if you haven't already seen it."
"Oct 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story , great characters, and great animation. Puss in boots the last wish delivers on all fronts, Puss is amazing, the character ark he goes on is great. But the thing the movie does best is the villains. One of the villains might just be one of if not the best villain in an animated movie. And the film also some how balances all villains perfectly. This is one of DreamWorks best."
"Oct 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Puss is adorable and funny.
"Oct 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great film, a 10 would not be enough... It has to be more than 1000000, this film is fantastic, I had the opportunity to see it in the cinema"
"Oct 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sorprendente, la primera me pareció muy mala, pero esta es maravillosa. Diría que es la segunda película estadounidense del año que mas me ha gustado tras Oppenheimer. Madura, fantasiosa y ejecutada con brillantez. La mejor película que vi de animación desde Coco. Dentro de la Saga Shrek, la pongo a la altura de las dos primeras."
"Oct 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Art cannot be rushed, or it won't be as perfect as it should be. Comparing Puss in Boot's return to the first time he spun off from the ""Shrek"" films shows how much the focus been improved to greater results. Certainly, inspired animation being freshly stylized with increased attentive coordination while the performances vocally attributes to the thematic heft with truly-embraced passion, particularly Banderas who personally emphasizes with his character's mortality. An exceptional homecoming to the surrounding statuses in promising, thought-provoking forms as the film amazes over its talented displays that nicely switches between humorous fun and realistic subtextual poignancy through a conscientious story that doesn't ridicule. (A-)"
"Oct 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Outstanding movie for the whole family. Great message and great delivery. I have already rewatched it a few times!
"Oct 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Music..Animatons...Plot...Story... Name it and this movie has is briliant. The main villain is just AWSOME. Character development is also such nice thing to see. Best animated movie ever for me.
"Oct 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Melhor que o outro, tem uma ótima história e excelentes vilões."
"Oct 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well, I got a thing for cats, and AB does a great job showing how suave they can be. Stylish. Cats are so cool. This, and the prequel, just show how cool they are. AB is one suave dude."
"Oct 6, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought this movie was a very heartwarming movie very fun for children and adults a like...
"Oct 6, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie is awesome
"Oct 6, 2023",POSITIVE,I think this is the same level as shrek 1 and shrek 2
"Oct 5, 2023",POSITIVE,It is a film that is really hard to not like. The voice performers are perfect and the film is actually quite funny. The always dependable Antonio Banderas leads the way as Puss. I enjoy this concept with the fairy tale characters who wander about in this universe. I loved the animation and the way the characters are drawn. A very fun animated film for adults and kids! Sequels coming! Final Score: 8.6/10
"Sep 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Es mejores secuelas de Dreamwords es muy buena es genial es entrenida y espectacular animación los personajes y los villanos son increíbles es un 9.4 de 10
"Sep 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"too overrated. I loved the message it tried to convey, but it felt sooo long as I watched it. anyways, i loved the character's development."
"Sep 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this movie, I absolutely loved the Character: Death. His whistle really changes the scene from funny to scary very quickly, would recommend."
"Sep 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"To be honest, it's one of the best movies I've ever watched PERIOD. I have watched it over 4 times already, and I could sit through the entire movie for hours without skipping a second. Or at least, mostly. Definitely the type of movie I'd recommend to anyone, not just kids."
"Sep 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Puss in boots did not live up to the hype, it was pretty standard animated movie and not that special, the best part is the character design of the wolf. I also really didn't like how it randomly switched to a stop motion style animation whenever there was action. They were trying to copy spiderverse and failed, it just make it hard to follow and annoying to watch. It's not terrible, but the internet made it sound amazing, and it was not that good. Definitely does not deserve to be rated at high as it is."
"Sep 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film and writing is incredible, it's funny although it should be a 13-plus with the villain of Death."
"Sep 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great animated film with fantastic animation, great characters, and great action"
"Sep 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic fun with some very clever nods to more nursery rhymes (of course!), along with a great message for everyone. Outstanding selection of voice actors. Not the best of the Shrek Universe but a fitting finale for Puss."
"Sep 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Now this is a good ending for Puss
"Sep 14, 2023",POSITIVE,The animation left me with an open mouth since the start + death was a perfect character
"Sep 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"For me, it feels like the Mario movie, but better in every way. Better protagonists, better villains, better plot, actual emotional moments, and it's improved in every way. 8/10."
"Sep 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"After the excellent first Puss In Boots, big hype to see his sequel, but what a fraud. A disaster on all points, at the complete opposite of the first movie, atmosphere, dialogues, humor/jokes, animation, graphic details...11 years after, all is bad in this second movie. For us it's an unsolvable riddle, an enigma. If it was only me I would live with it like ""ok it's just me and the time"", but kids said it before I said it : ""it's not funny, and what's wrong with their fur ?!"". We had the same feeling than when we saw Angry Birds 2, the first Angry Birds is a masterpiece, the second is a mercantile joke with a very cheap humor. But animation was good for Angry Birds 2, not for Puss In Boots 2. Very bad movie, and more compared to the first Puss In Boots, so 2 stars for us."
"Sep 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"An endearing feline protagonist, accompanied by a great soundtrack, and a heartwarming tearjerker that reminds us to cherish those who choose to be in our lives."
"Sep 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Award winning for sure 😁 the animation was nice, voice acting was wonderfully done, and the overall story and characters were the best.
who else wants to see Shrek and big jack horner throw hands?"
"Sep 8, 2023",POSITIVE,This was an masterpiece that is a true gigachad of 2022
"Sep 8, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is really good my only problem with it is that these are the types of movies where I can enjoy it so much on the first time I watch and then the second time it gets really boring maybe that's just me but still pretty good go check it out
"Sep 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is an unexpected gem of a movie! The art, the several villans/antagonists, and the main characters all look so amazing and are so lovable. This movie's art style is phenomenal, an amazing leap forward from the last puss in boots movies and other Shrek universe films. The main villain throughout the entirety of the film is so awesome! He is a perfectly executed character that makes me love watching the movie, even the parts where it puts Puss in danger."
"Sep 7, 2023",POSITIVE,I've heard a lot of good stuff about this movie by my friends at college and now I've seen it and it's... PERFECT. Love how sometimes (mostly during fight scenes) the animation transitions between lower and higher frames (kinda like spider-verse) and I love it and the Ending got me thrilled to wait what is next for the crew... and perhaps... their old friends...
"Sep 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Very awesome. I was super into this.
"Sep 3, 2023",POSITIVE,It's an awesome movie to watch with the family.
"Sep 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Finally watched the next instalment in the Shrek universe- Puss in Boots The Last Wish. This film is one of my favorite animated films of all time now!

To be completely honest I watched this film only for the antagonist but I was pleasantly surprised by all the supporting characters, yes all the characters. It is a rarity to find great supporting characters in animated films unfortunately but this film breaks that stereotype. All of them have something to offer to the story and the themes, my favorites were Perrito, Goldi and of course Death.

The conflict , the resolution and the ending in my opinion are just perfection because I cannot think of anything better than what I actually saw! Moving to the technical aspects, the animation was spectacular the best in the universe, I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen and the design of death was the best-I watched a video about his design which made me appreciate the character even more. The music was pretty cool too especially death's whistle which was creepy as hell and I assure you that it will haunt you forever.

Coming to the negatives I kind of found it difficult to get immersed into the world during the initial 20 minutes but when I understood the theme of the film I got right into it. That would be my only complaint.

Finally Puss in Boots is a really mature animated film and has to be the best from the universe yet."
"Aug 31, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this movie soooooooooooooooo muchhh. It absolutely exceeded my expection. I came in the theater just because my nieces wanted to watch it and I came out absolutely amazed. The animation and art direction of the movie is spectacular and the story connects so well. Must watch 1000%
"Aug 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish - 10/10. What a lovely surprise! This sequel to the iconic character Puss In Boots see Puss having to deal with the idea of death. Being an iconic cat burglar cat, he must come to terms with the fact that he is at his last life, and that he must try to find a special wish granting thing to help him get his lives back in check. Along the way, he ends up making new (and old) friends, and realizes that he doesn't need 9 lives, rather, he just needs the one to understand how beautiful life is. And what a beautiful film in general! A mature family friendly film dealing with the idea of death, and how we must enjoy the life we have regardless of what may come in the future. Also, made me a little teary eyed while watching it! Awesome movie and definitely recommend!"
"Aug 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic movie and needs way more attention. And dare I say it? It should have won the Oscars in 2022, not only for animation but also for amazing story and design."
"Aug 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"O Gato de Botas percebe que gastou todas as suas vidas e está na última. É quando ele descobre que existe um lugar que atende um único desejo e parte disposto a recuperar as suas nove vidas. Porém há outros interessados pelo caminho. Esta sequência de Gato de Botas tornou-se uma grata surpresa. Possui uma história melhor e a qualidade técnica da animação está fantástica, misturando vários estilos de animação a la Homem-Aranha no Aranhaverso. Os personagens principais passam por arcos que os modificam mesmo. O elenco de vozes originais está muito bem e, puxando a sardinha para o nosso lado, Wagner Moura está muito bem fazendo a voz do Lobo. As sequências de ação estão muito boas, com a utilização de menos quadros, com isso o efeito de câmera lenta e imagem congelada produz frames fantásticos. Parabéns pela Dreamworks que fez uma animação à altura do personagem e os redime do último Shrek que foi terrível."
"Aug 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"The animation is stunning, the art is fantastic, the heart is felt, the passion of everyone from the actors to the one guy who helps checks pixels is there! It's beautiful, genuinely incredible."
"Aug 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Perfect movie. I could say nothing more, nothing to criticize."
"Aug 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the most beautifully animated movies of modern time. The plot and characters are really good as well. Also pretty funny. Overall, amazing movie."
"Aug 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Good it has a really good plot story. I can't think of one time I was so confused about what was going on it was letting us really get to know how the characters felt and a little background information.
"Aug 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dreamworks once again show that it is possible to make really good movie, without forcefully pushing wokeism down our throats. Great movie, pleasant to watch and with pretty animations. Writing is on a different level, comparing to most movies made in last decade. Main antagonist is so unobtrusively well written that you almost forgot it's supposed to be movie for kids. Dreamworks casually dropped coldest villian that 90% of horrors made post '90. This movie has it all, little bit of sadness, little bit of seriousness, lot's of laughs and what is most important, good message, teachings of values that is almost extinct in modern cinema.
Overall strong 93/100"
"Aug 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great animation, great action, great villain, and great character development."
"Aug 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Last Wish is a surprisingly relevant movie. It's still a fun ride, but this project skillfully dives into the importance of valuing one's life. Also, the main villian is among the most ominous to haunt a children's animation."
"Aug 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Una aventura gloriosa llena de emoción, drama e ingenio, envuelta en una animación que esta para chuparse los dedos. Una secuela spin-off que demuestra que esta saga aun tiene mucho que ofrecer."
"Aug 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"over-rated sequel, over done and overcooked with passable animation"
"Aug 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Funny, colorful fun for the whole family. Best movie in the Shrek/Puss in Boots franchise."
"Aug 19, 2023",POSITIVE,increible pelicula muy buena historia un excelente villano y personajes que son comicos como perrito
"Aug 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Movie Ever! Must see! Great message.  Perfect for not only kids but adults as well. Absolutely hilarious had me laughing out loud throughout the whole thing also made me cry. This movie was absolutely phenomenal and I'm usually not into animated movies but this one I've watched about a hundred times.
"Aug 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Easily one of the best Dreamworks movies with incredible animation and amazing villains, with Death obviously being the best and being my new favourite dreamworks villain. Great voice acting all around. Peritto was much better and funnier then I expected and is one of the main reasons why the panic attack scene was the best scene in the whole movie. 12/10"
"Aug 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A remarkable tale that will stand the test of time for animation & film. Such a huge breakthrough for stylish artistic design, & an emotionally-driven story that will resonate with everyone. A must see for all."
"Aug 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing, great story and graphics."
"Aug 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme é muito bom !! A história é muito boa , o vilão da medo é espetacular !!!"
"Aug 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Where can I begin with.
The animation is superb and the fight scenes are gorgeous.
The characters wheter them being new or old had fantastic development and the humor is really funny.
Death is a great character and about the tones of the movie it speaks about important themes,but threat them well not like Disney does."
"Aug 15, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is insane. I didn't expect it to be this good.
"Aug 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"An amazing movie, great plot, great message, the characters are so well developed, so much better than the first one, great movie for families that want to have fun and also have a positive message."
"Aug 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Woah, this was really good. Awesome animation style and a really interesting and personal story for Puss as he deals with his fear of death and learns to let people in. And as always, Antonia Banderas is perfect in the role. Extra points for Harvey Guillén as Perrito."
"Aug 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,I left the movie earlier. Just maybe not my style 🤷‍♀️
"Aug 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,In was the bacis storyline of the Puss and Boots Movies
"Aug 13, 2023",POSITIVE,A beautifully animated film filled with thrilling choreographed action sequences. Intriguing character developments and introducing one of the best animated villians ever brought to screen. It is well paced written story about immortality that can be enjoyed by both adults and children.
"Aug 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Puss in boots👍👍👍👍

"Aug 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow , I wasn't expecting this movie to be so great , I mean , I really was expecting to hate it and click stop after 5 minutes BUT this movie is awesome ( I actually didn't care about this character before watching this film, only reason I gave it a chance is because I heard the buzz about this movie being excellent) the movie delivers in every aspect: , visually STUNNING , dialogues, music , main plot , villains, full of meaningful action . I dare to say this movie deserves a 95 . After finished watching in hbo I searched if there is a 3d edition so I can get it but it seems  it doesn't exists. Now this is one of my favorite animated films."
"Aug 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie blew me away. The animation was crisp, the action was fast paced, and the story/morals were will thought out. Also, we got a killer of a villain in Lobo!

Well done, DreamWorks, well done! This animation critique is impressed."
"Aug 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Milhões de vezes melhor que qualquer animação da Disney
"Aug 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Whether you're someone who has watched all the Shrek films or not, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish will be a fun movie to watch. It doesn't lean heavily on one's knowledge of fairytales or anything related to the Shrek movies to get its jokes or enjoy this story. The jokes a goofy, the action is solid, and the plot is interesting overall. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a fun reintroduction to this world with a charismatic character that lands safely on his feet."
"Aug 8, 2023",POSITIVE,This is probably the best DreamWorks movie IN YEARS.
"Aug 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Bruh it was so good that my house got broken into during the movie and I didn't even notice
"Aug 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Nothing special. More of the same with this franchise. I was curious just because the general consensus of good ratings, plus the Oscar nod.... But nah"
"Aug 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Laughed, cried, hoped, it was a wonderful movie! A must watch!"
"Aug 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish has a storyline that has a rough start but then gradually brings out the fearless risks to an engaging story with a lot of enthusiasm.
"Aug 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Best one by far of the Shrek Spinoffs
"Aug 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,The worst one by far
"Aug 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such a leap up from the last movie.
Amazing story with a darker tone then most animated movies.
While still keeping the character's charm and the fairy tale aspects of the world.
The character of death is excellent, and is not really a villain in my opinion.
He shows Puss the value of his last life through raw fear, which is cruel but effective.
The comedy-relief character has depth rather then being a 1 dimensional joke.
And the ending makes me weirdly exited for the sequel, considering were it's going.

Because of the darker tone, the movie is NOT suited for children.
But as someone who grew up with the franchise, It's great to see the franchise grow up with it's audience."
"Aug 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing animation amazing story amazing voice acting amazing movie
"Aug 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie. Nice animation. Both adults and children can watch it.
"Aug 5, 2023",POSITIVE,The animation was phenomenal. All of the characters were amazing. And the story was great too.
"Aug 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"A very good movie. Saw it with my Kindergarten aged son and wife on a family vacation. It was charming, enchanting, and had real meaning. I give it 4 stars for its quality and an extra 1/2 star because it was such a treasured family memory."
"Aug 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Okay, but not at all the sequel the first movie deserved. It fell flat for me, but I will agree it is beautifully animated. Also the Favorite Fearless Hero song must go. That was not it."
"Aug 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"True to what we expect from the ""Puss in Boots"" franchise. Fun, catchy, well-written script and sweet characters. Definitely woth watching!"
"Aug 4, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is what I watch when I need to be uplifted. We can all learn from Perrito!
"Aug 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Animation is fantastic. If you are a fan of animation and enjoy seeing new styles done well, it is a must see.

Voice acting is fun. Not every joke landed, but enough landed for me to still give it the five stars. John Mulaney doesn't do it for me, but he played an unlikeable character anyway.

Ending of the story got a little muddled, but not muddled enough to subtract a star. 

Two thumbs up"
"Aug 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Una película muy fresca , fue increíble ver su animación y trama además de traernos devuelta a este personaje"
"Aug 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"A beautiful heartfelt story that almost makes you forget it's animation. Fantastic performances with John Mulaney standing out as a very creepy Jack Horner. Good adventure, good message, no preaching, no politics. This is why Universal keeps beating Disney."
"Aug 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Gorgeous to look at, expertly animated. Overall a bundle of fun!"
"Aug 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Not even going to lie probably one of the best animated movies I saw. The fighting scenes where very well made and the graphics where amazing.
"Aug 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Better than expected. Saw it twice with my kids. 
Funny and cute."
"Aug 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story about the 9 lives as a cat and what Puss has done with them all. Highly recommend this movie . And even though a sequel, it stands on it's own easily."
"Aug 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Funny with great animation, while dealing with issues as deep as fearing death with grace. As the film went on I was continuously blown away without much I enjoyed it and how it dealt with adult issues in a way palatable for all ages, while still providing plenty of laughs and adventure."
"Aug 3, 2023",POSITIVE,This is DreamWorks best movie ever!!!
"Aug 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Antonio Banderas brings light to fierce and lovable gato in this unexpected sequel by having him find the true meaning of life after already living for quite some time along with Death trailing him voiced by Moura. The supporting characters were a great addition to story telling and many comedic moments throughout the film. Animation style was top notch proving that perhaps there is more stories to tell with these characters.
"Aug 3, 2023",POSITIVE,My Rating: 10/10 (Perfect)
"Aug 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"this movie was great, all the villains played a good role in the movie, and you can feel and see the fear of puss when death follows him."
"Aug 2, 2023",POSITIVE,I absolutely LOVED watching this movie. Ever since I was a kid I loved the puss in boots franchise and to see it now with this AMAZING animation and story is just magical!
"Aug 2, 2023",POSITIVE,It was fantastic! Made me cry several times and laugh!
"Aug 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun and fun but also fun. One of my favorite movies.
"Aug 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss In Boots: The Last Wish

It's not every time that a franchise can progressively get better, but this new instalment in the Shrek universe proves just that. Aided by stunning visuals, Puss In Boots: The Last Wish takes audiences on a thrilling, heartfelt and contemplative journey. It also blends its dark elements perfectly with its comedy.

The plot is poignant. The characters are very distinct, and each one is developed properly. Having antagonists that range from sympathetic to horrifying also helps keep things fun. The voice work of the cast should also be praised. The action sequences are well-choreographed and smooth.

One of the best animations from DreamWorks.

9-9.5/10"
"Aug 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Outstanding movie an amazing performance from dreamworks
"Aug 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Surprisingly amazing movie for both adults and kids.
"Jul 31, 2023",POSITIVE,A movie for children that directly confronts the fear of death with a beautiful artstyle and actual tension.
"Jul 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie to this date remains extremely close to my heart, not only did they bring back a nostalgic character from my past they brought him back better, more funny, and more creative. The animation, the script, the plot, the twist, and of course the characters made this movie an absolute must see, so stop reading this and watch it!"
"Jul 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Toca temas difíciles de una manera espectacular, hay amor, comedia, terror, todo junto y muy bien armado. Una de las mejores películas que he visto<3"
"Jul 29, 2023",POSITIVE,The villain gives me chills.
"Jul 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a really good film. The animation is good, the same art style as ""Into the Spiderverse"". Antonio Banderas is captivating as his iconic Puss in Boots. Wagner Moura's character Wolf makes for a terrifying villian. The plot is decent and there is some good comedy and action scenes. Kids and adults will enjoy this film."
"Jul 28, 2023",POSITIVE,An adorable heart warning cute movie .
"Jul 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Probably the greatest big studio western animated film out there. It's truly something else. Deep, sad, hilarious, and awesome!"
"Jul 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hands down, an amazing film for all audiences. Well worth watching!"
"Jul 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"My son and I just watched this movie and we both really enjoyed it. This is a fun romp for anyone ages 2 to 102. I appreciate when a movie sets out to entertain it's audience, not lecture them. Give this one a go!"
"Jul 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it.  Made me laugh and cry.  A beautiful ride for all ages.  Brought out the kid in me.
"Jul 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love this movie, IT FELT VERY ALIVE! This deserves a 100/100 rating. :)"
"Jul 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Coming into this movie I completely expected a milked dull children's movie that was simply made to make money off parents being begged by their children. However, I watched this movie and was stunned at how well put together it was. Death is one of the best villains in any pixar movie along with the refreshing funny villain Jack Horner. This movie hit all emotions and made multiple jokes for the adults in the room. The comic book like animations were neat and the story was very good and fun. An amazing movie from pixar!"
"Jul 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Better plot, pacing, and characterization than most ""adult"" movies."
"Jul 23, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie takes on the popular hand drawn stop-motion-style art and give a hand-drawn feeling. With a mix of smooth rubber and Smeared blurred movements. With a great story and good character roster.
"Jul 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Llena de magia, acción y aprendizaje. Es maravillosa."
"Jul 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots is the perfect family film to watch if you're a fan of fairy tales with a twist. This colourful, adventure-packed movie uses the full potential of animation in its action scenes and sprinkles humour throughout. The character development of Puss in Boots was satisfying to watch as he learns to be humble and to live life to its fullest. Nota al margen: amando la música española"
"Jul 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BEST ANIMATED MOVIES IVE EVER SEEN!! :DD
Puss had an amazing glow-up and i love that the characters are from kids' fairy tales lol. The animation was magnificent and the story was utterly amazing :D"
"Jul 23, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie blows you away with every character and the plot and the twist are exactly what they needed to be.
"Jul 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved every single minute of it, I didn't expect to see such good depiction of panic attacks in an animated movie about an orange cat but here it is. I went back to the theater and watched it 3 times"
"Jul 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I know I'm late to this, just watched it actually. It's as amazing. I've watched so many movies this year(probably too many). This movie however was my favorite so far of this entire year, there was no moment that felt boring or stale. Every single second was exiting and filled with personality, the animation style is one which I really like and hope to find more movies alike in the near future as well. Anyways I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone looking for something to watch!"
"Jul 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The animation is gorgeous, and I love how vivid and bright and fresh it looks. 

The plot is just incredible, and the protagonists are all so endearing. Wait, scratch that, all the characters are endearing (except for Big Jack Horner, who was just hilarious in how thoroughly evil he was, that was really fresh too). 

This is the best movie I've ever watched, from every possible angle I can think of. I absolutely recommend."
"Jul 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Have never been a fan of kids movies. I'm usually the one that recommends scary movies and such. But when I tell you this movie is an absolute must see IT'S A MUST SEE. The story was amazing. The graphics are amazing. The scenery is amazing. But what made this movie is amazing as it is. It's the MORAL that it teaches you. Nothing makes me  shed a tear but this movie did just that. Simply…AMAZING.
"Jul 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The studio that keeps delivering good films. The story, the visuals and the sound all fit so well. Making hard work look easy… and great! Bravo"
"Jul 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely fantastic story telling and art. By far the best movie in ages.
"Jul 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I wish they would have promoted this better I would've rather seen it at the movies then at home on Netflix. The graphics, acting, and story were great though. The whole family loved it."
"Jul 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best of the Shrek franchise (YES, BETTER THAN SHREK 2!!!)"
"Jul 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Good dreamworks movie
"Jul 18, 2023",POSITIVE,An amazing fairy tale story for all ages. Great comedic timing for almost all of the jokes.
"Jul 17, 2023",POSITIVE,watch now watch now watch now watch now
"Jul 17, 2023",POSITIVE,It is a wonderful family friendly ish movie you will not regret seeing it
"Jul 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best animated movies of all time. Not only is the animation amazing, the action exceptional, and the villians some of the best I've ever seen, it connected with me deeply on a personal level about the nature of death."
"Jul 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Simplesmente perfeito ❤️ não tem palavras para essa animação!!!! Maravilhosa, chorei horrores, bom de mais."
"Jul 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great characters, phenomenal visuals, animation, cinematography, imaginative story, and a great message the best movie of 2022 and this masterpiece should have been nominated for best picture 4/4"
"Jul 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great references to fairy tales. Very entertaining
"Jul 17, 2023",POSITIVE,aight lemme cook rq this is the best animated movie I have seen since UP. This movie is deep as hell looking into the spirit of every character from death himself to the side characters.
"Jul 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought the movie is refreshing. It carries the same vibe as the recent Spiderverse movie. Vibrant colours and never bored.
"Jul 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"From the beginning, you can see the upgrade in the animation that they did in this movie when compared to the first one. In the same way, the story has much more meaning and the main characters as well as the secondary ones contain a complete development in their trajectory. ""Perrito"" ends up winning our hearts with his innocence. The end-end left me with a very big illusion."
"Jul 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Excelente continuação. O filme ensina muitas virtudes e valores morais. O Perrito é bonitinho demais.
"Jul 16, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a REALLY good movie the art is amazing
"Jul 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"The hype is mostly real for this surprising animated feature. Puss in Boots was nothing to write home about back when it came out. It was a solid movie, no doubt. But this time around, the stakes are higher and Puss is a wily veteran. Everything is just more fun and action packed. The animation is also breathtaking at times with unique hand-drawn segments. The villains can be questionable, depending on how one views it. But as a whole, The Last Wish is a huge win for Dreamworks and may even set up another Shrek film."
"Jul 16, 2023",POSITIVE,It is the most magnificent animation of my life.
"Jul 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Are you people blind? How can this be called a children's movie? It is evil beyond imagination! The wolf alone is demonic and all that witchcraft and death. Then you ask ""why is my child having nightmares?"" "" why is my child acting out?"" ""Why is my child saying bad words?"" Make no mistake! This movie is demonic and has evil written all over it! As a parent, we all need to be aware of what our children watch and let in our homes! It is saddening to see how this is the number 1 movie on Netflix because parents do not care to understand the evil behind what their children watch! If your child has started to act differently or is always scared, beware of what they are watching!!!!! This industry is going down and it's about time!"
"Jul 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"this is the final chapter but certainly not the least one, Banderas' voice has so much charisma it'll blow you away , this is a must see"
"Jul 15, 2023",POSITIVE,now here is a movie that can make you feel a lot of feeling in just under 2 hours
"Jul 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Has everything: A great villain, interesting character development, unique animation… The people who worked on this really cared and it showed! Best animated movie of the year easily."
"Jul 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Who wrote this!? The dialogue for one thing is on a level never seen before, even from live action entertainment. Don't get me started with Death, incredible and the Jiminy cricket character had me rofl."
"Jul 15, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is awesome the animation is good the acting is good and the music is good as well I would like to see a TV series based off of this movie with the animation 10/10
"Jul 14, 2023",POSITIVE,I was surprised how much I liked this movie. I put this on for my son when it became available on Netflix and ended up watching the whole thing with him. Loved the artistic animation and excellent depiction of Death. I always loved Shrek 2 growing up and this is the best thing to come out of the franchise since. 10/10 Dreamworks!
"Jul 14, 2023",POSITIVE,ow...this movie had me tearing up a couple times. this is an amazing movie and the only ones that are keeping you from one of the most amazing movie experiences you will ever have... is sadly you. everyone should watch this movie it teaches a really strong lessons in here. beautiful story great music and fantastic art and minds of DreamWorks have made puss in boots the last wish my favorite movie I've ever seen. there is nothing wrong with this movie at all. many blessings and praise the lord and creator
"Jul 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"A perfect movie,with action and humor.The first was boring but this sequel was amazing..."
"Jul 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Simply a reinvention of the Shrek franchise! And certainly a villain that gives you nightmares.
"Jul 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Es gran película animada bien hecha toma temas serios muy bien y ase bien el humor los villanos son increíbles el lobo como muerte es terrorífico y me encanta su silbido y el gato se desarrolla buy bien ahhhh que buena secuela
"Jul 11, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't even need to explain why this movie gets 5 stars from me
"Jul 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Whilst I enjoyed the first Puss in Boots 12 years ago, no one was pining for a sequel especially with the Shrek IP having cooled off in the meantime, so I had little expectations or intention to see it when it arrived in the cinemas last year. Kudos then to its writing and directing team to find the courage and a fresh angle to tackle this which manages to reinvigorate an old, perhaps even one-note, character and brings pathos and some fantastically rendered visuals to go with it that almost made me wish I had seen it on a bigger screen. Re-focusing and re-imagining Antonio Banderas's Puss as an existential character facing his own mortality after squandering 8 of his 9 lives within a fairytale world where Goldilocks and the 3 Bears (cheekily voiced by Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman and Ray Winstone) are a cockney crime family and John Mulaney's Jack Horner represents the big corporate baddie, the story is essentially one extended Wacky race-style chase to get a wish from a fallen star in an enchanted forest where the visual department is unleashed to delightfully creative effects. Now I get why, quite rightly so, this was nominated for an Oscar earlier this year."
"Jul 11, 2023",POSITIVE,The animation in this movie and story are great! The characters are so fun and it is better than the original?
"Jul 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good message, entertaining characters, funny jokes
Entertaining for kids and adults alike"
"Jul 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,adorable movie that exceeded my expectations. very funny too.
"Jul 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie made Dreamworks better than Disney, it is a masterpiece"
"Jul 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"''it was perfect. PERFECT. everything right down to the last minute detail.''

The humour, the plot, the characters...
Dreamworks did what they are good at, making great animations. Very much looking forward to the next one."
"Jul 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Perfection. That's all this is. If you think this is bad then you clearly don't have taste for good movies. It's absolutely fresh. It's got everything. The choice of villains. The choice of characters. It's all in here. You've got 3 villains. You've got the more kindhearted, redeemable villain. Who's actually portrayed really nicely. You've got just a classic old evil villain. Nothing else. And you've got a crazy, unbeatable force. Not going to spoil any names but the main villain (who technically isn't even a villain) is probably the best or one of the best villains DreamWorks has ever made. Even though there are very few scenes of him, it feels like he's in the movie all the time. The plot is good. The acting is good. The jokes are good. This movie is a masterpiece. One of the best movies made by DreamWorks. Looking forward to Kung Fu Panda 4. So overall, this movie is really really good. 100% recommend to everyone who hasn't seen it."
"Jul 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Didn't know how much I missed movies with live lessons and morals that were layered in the subtext to well. No much better than expected!
"Jul 6, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best animated movies of all time
"Jul 6, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best animated movies of all time
"Jul 6, 2023",POSITIVE,My daughters and I love this movie they see it like twice a day lol so sad it's getting taken off from peacock
"Jul 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Animação incrível, história boa e bem desenvolvida, além de ser bem divertido. Me arrancou boas risadas, enfim a franquia Shrek sendo ressucitada. Amei o filme."
"Jul 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pros:
-All the characters are great and entertaining to watch
-It's surprisingly dark but in a good way
-The animation looks spectacular
-Its pretty funny
-All 3 of the villains are all handled greatly
Cons
-Nothing really"
"Jul 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"The animation was amazing, the story line was great, the characters where amazing and it was on of the best movies that have ever been made in 2022"
"Jul 5, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was enjoyable. The death guy was a little creepy. But the kids didn't seem too bothered by it.
"Jul 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,Pretty good movie! Family enjoyed it!
"Jul 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm laughing because I didn't expect to enjoy it so much. I cannot believe I am about to write such a genuine and in-depth on freaking PUSS IN BOOTS of all movies. 
Firstly, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish had the trademark unbelievable wit and humor of the previous movies. With John Mulaney as one of the voice actors, the already hilarious script became so much better. 

The character arc was incredible (although I may be biased as a sucker for the arrogant character) and his romantic dynamic with Kitty was one of the most enjoyable straight romances I've seen recently. It was just imperfect and genuine enough, while also being well-balanced as a friendship and partnership. 
Perrito, of course, is impossible not to love and maintains a complicated story despite the initial ""comedic relief"" impression he gives. The multiple dimensions to the characters was an instant green flag for this film.

I've seen this talked about a lot, and the way they conveyed a panic attack in Puss was perfectly executed in my opinion. Not simply with the way his friends and himself handled the anxiety, but they artistic choices as well.
I'll admit, this is what I wanted to talk about the most. I was so impressed I wanted to cry. I've seen the style used here popping up in more places over the past few years (one example being Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse) Where they play with 2D and 3D designs, frame rates, and camera angles to shake up the conventional CGI animation. That combined with the BEAUTIFUL color schemes and auditory techniques (such as the ringing and muffled sounds whenever a character is struck hard or dissociating) made for a gorgeously immersive experience. The use of visual symmetry and dynamics (such as all the characters at different points of the star) made it all the more satisfying.

I don't need to point out how cleverly Death was designed, but I'm already on a roll so why not? His design with the ghostly-white-versus-black color pallet paired with his twin scythes lended themselves to the traditional reaper technique, but there were so many more clever details. The way his eyes flashed, the haunting whistle, and his unnervingly normal voice and demeanor were all techniques that made such a brilliant villain.

Finally, I noticed much more linguistic representation in this movie. It may seem small, but personally (even as an American who can just barely speak Spanish) seeing most of the characters alternate between English and fluent Spanish added cultural representation I didn't know I needed to see. It made me SO happy to see, and in my opinion added yet another layer to the characters in the movie.

I have to reiterate: I did not expect to be so impressed and delighted by this movie. I'm almost embarrassed to be writing this review with the same vocabulary and conviction as a damn college essay, but knowing that good animation and storytelling is still thriving is really all I care about. Now I just have to convince my family to watch it!"
"Jul 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun film that works for kiddos and adults. Has some real heart and a good story, good action and plenty of adventure. Good life lessons to draw from the story, very relatable."
"Jul 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"The unexpected sequel to the Shrek spin off film was gorgeous with beautiful Spiderverse style animation, witty humor, unique characters, and is just a fun time for young and old alike."
"Jul 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Best puss in boots movie so far. The animation and plot and it's storytelling is fantastic. I just really like how they build this fantastical world that is not afraid to take things from other fairy tales. Just great
"Jul 3, 2023",POSITIVE,What a great movie..... amazing.....
"Jul 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss In Boots The Last Wish is a beautiful movie that tackles the topic of anxiety, death, living life in the moment, and excepting what you lack in a very serious, realistic, and mature tone that left me absolutely speachless whilst walking out of the theater. There isn't too much that hasn't been said but it's interesting story and gorgeous visuals will keep anyone engaged with the movie, the perfection of Puss In Boots The Last Wish is how this movie does not have a target demographic and that anyone no matter their age will be able to appreciate it for what it's worth. This is an absolute must see movie as this is Dreamworks' BEST movie to date for its lovable characters, mature story, and it's impactful messages that blew most peoples expectations (including mine) out of the water. I have no issues with it. Masterpiece in writing and a movie that anyone can learn from."
"Jul 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"an excellent sequel, the animation inspired by spider-man in spider-verse was beautiful in the movie and the villain is cool and scary, also other new characters that we meet in this movie are very well done that we relatable with."
"Jul 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"LOL, the funniest 01 hour: and 42 minutes ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Starring (for the 2nd time) the voice of Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Jul 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Best dreamworks movie
"Jul 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"A- 
moved me to tears. lol"
"Jul 2, 2023",POSITIVE,One of my favorite animated movies in the last few years. Really funny. Terrific writing. Excellent art. Outstanding voice writing. I could not recommend this highly enough!!!
"Jul 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Actually a masterpiece. Just watch this, and not the first. Cuz it isnt needed!"
"Jul 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,Really enjoyed this one!
"Jun 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie was bad not good for any Shrek fans
"Jun 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"First of all, that wolf has no reason to be that sexy. 
Second, this movie had no reason to give me so many feelings I will never recover, but in a good way."
"Jun 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"11 év után visszatér mindenki kedvenc kardforgató hőse, nem is akárhogy…
A Csizmás, a kandúr az utolsó kívánság egy családbarát, humoros és komoly témát feldolgozó film.Az animáció gyönyörű, a karakterek kidolgozottak, szóval ez egy nagyszerű film.
SPOILER
A halál és a félelem témáját is nagyon értelmesen mutatja be, hogy Kandúr hogy néz szembe azzal, hogy nem halhatatlan, és a végén tudja, hogy nem győzheti le a Nagy Gonosz Farkast, aki maga a halál, de addig harcol az utolsó életéig, ameddig csak tud.
SPOILER VÉGE
Hogy kinek ajánlom a Csizmás, a kandúr 2-őt?
Mindenkinek."
"Jun 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"An absolute legend! Puss in boots: The last wish was the movie the Sheck franchise needed, but I don't know why Dreamworks aded the blood, in a movie for kids."
"Jun 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muy perfecto. Dooo watch. I love the movie. Wasn't that bad, rly good!"
"Jun 27, 2023",POSITIVE,the second greatest animated film ever made
"Jun 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Great animation that offers humour for all ages.
"Jun 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Beautiful action. Good storytelling. And tye characters were good. But death was amazing and made for some of the best animated scenes ever.
"Jun 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Esta secuela del Gato Con Botas ofrece algo nuevo usando la fórmula de Spideman Into The Spiderverse. Deja de lado la animación 3D vista en su predecesora y da un salto más allá con una combinación de animación 2D y 3D, haciendo que se sienta como una mejora y actualización de la franquicia de Shrek. La película es visualmente disfrutable con esa mezcla de animaciones que la hacen sentir como un comic o una pintura en movimiento. Esta animación actualizada se lleva toda la atención de la película. Antonio Banderas y Salma Hayek vuelven a ser la pareja que tanta energía le daba a la película anterior y esa chispa no se pierde. Aquí el felino aventurero aprende una lección en esta aventura sobre que la vida no es siempre fama y aventuras, ya que todo tiene un final. Gato aprende a evolucionar más en esta película. Ricitos De Oro y los tres osos se vuelven unos antagonistas entrañables por ver como son ellos como familia. Incluso Ricitos aprende lo que es el significado de la familia en esta aventura. El lobo tendría que haber tenido más participación por lo oscuro que es y hubiese sido perfecto como villano principal. Esta película es una extraordinaria secuela que no solo revive de nuevo el universo de Shrek, sino que al igual que The Bad Guys, es una gran actualización para DreamWorks. Mi calificación final para esta película es un 9/10."
"Jun 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best animation of decade 👍, 
Art style-10/10
Story-10/10
Characters -10/10

 DreamWorks really did wonder with did title and I hope they will use same or similar animation in upcoming shrek 5(which is teased here :) ) -- protagonists are sailing to far far away kingdom ;)"
"Jun 21, 2023",POSITIVE,There is no way to compile my thoughts into a simple review. Go watch it and be amazed!
"Jun 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have 0 words for this movie, its amazing!"
"Jun 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Puss in boots: the last wish is a spectacular plot and fun and entertaining at the same time with a couple of references and spectacular animation I also love this movie
"Jun 20, 2023",POSITIVE,That's the second best animated movie i've ever seen
"Jun 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Everything about this movie is a must-see. The characters, the story, the come-backs, the animation and cinematography, directly inspired by spider verse! oh— the antagonist takes the cake to be honest! The best animated villain this year by far!
It's great to see puss in boots make a comeback, and this film alone is the great awakening of the Dreamwork's franchise. Automatically one of dreamwork's best films.
Bravo Dreamworks! Your really gonna beat Disney this decade.

(If shrek wasn't enough)"
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is the best the story the fights the animation bro death is the best villain
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie I've seen in 2023
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Movie is an absolute masterpiece. The way how its animated at 12 frames per second is so incredible to me. The writing, the animation, and the voices are spot on. I totally recommend this movie."
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The animation alone is top notch. Easily one of the nicest looking films. The humour is also done very well. Definitely a fun time to watch.
"Jun 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing. A movie with a solid theme, amazing comedy, and fantastic action. Would recommend for all ages!"
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"O Último Pedido foi uma experiência que não via há anos! Seus detalhes na animação são impecáveis, com toda certeza o melhor visual da franquia Shrek.
É um filme que sabe aproveitar muito bem momentos engraçados e momentos dramáticos. Antagonistas carismáticos e um vilão tenebroso.
O único problema é a falta de intensidade em momentos desesperadores, embora que ainda sejam, mas que são interrompidos com outros dois personagens que tirão a tensão do momento. E deveria ter mais aproveitamento do vilão, que por sinal é incrível. O filme tem um introdução extraordinária, um desenvolvimento decente e um final épico. Recomendo."
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a spectacle of a sequel, probably the best in the franchise, with amazing villains, amazing themes, a heartfelt story, amazing voice acting, and a beautiful animation style."
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me: The only people we hate in this movie are those that hate and especially those that refuse to be redeemed in a single way even when they are about to die as well and especially never had a single purpose in there life this whole 
Scuttle ( 2023 ): Yah. And I mean Jack horror dosnet even go after Pinocchio to have revenge him ether i any single way possible and not even having all the magic in the world do anything for him or for to even finally get Vengeance on even that poor wooden boy who is obviously a real boy for by now. Yet we don't even get any scenes with him and Pinocchio ether or why was he never there for him in dreamworks and especially that now thinking about all that Jack horror I mean hornor is just a complete !!JOKE!! Those everything else in this movie is just right especially when he dies while this young hero and the user of this account im with is the perfect definition of herosisum in everyway and Animat especially has every right to give this movie the Animat seal of approval. Though should made that his number one instead Del torsos Pinocchio for this and especially last year in general at that so yah. So watch it now
My Pikachu: So yah Watch Puss In Boots The Last Wish Right now 
Me: Yes
My Rioul ( Taichi ): and the consistent from dreamworks is perfect for me just as much as both Pinocchio for obvious reasons and Pinocchio. And as for Jack Hornor
Jack Hornor as a pinecone: * falls out the tree then breaks and dies * 
All of us and as well Jimainy cricket ( both from Disney & Dreamworks ) and r we everyone else in this movie + Scuttle ( the little mermaid 2023 ): He is Gone. For good this time 
Story: 8/10
Animation: 10/10
Characters: 9/10
Overall: 9/10 🤩"
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Legit gives you the chills when death is shown. Has great humor, and many reference to lots of fairy tales and storys. It has a fantastic storyline and it has awesome animation. The fights scenes are even better. I'll give this 10 out of 10 that's how good I think it is."
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good movie!
Very good for families to watch."
"Jun 17, 2023",POSITIVE,es mejor que su primera entrega es bellisima tratar la muerta muy seria es oscura el lobo me gusta como la muerte y el desarrollo del gato es genial
"Jun 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Puss in Boots It gives me the vibe of Shrek 4 that is similar. But it always made me cry in my thoughts. I like linking stories Makes me want to watch Shrek season 5.
"Jun 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I love the story, and I love puss in boots. HOWEVER! The comic books animation was awful. It took me three attempts and some serious self discipline to make it through the entirety of the movie. If it were a show and that was the style fine. But this was the second part of the movie series and it was choppy and distracting."
"Jun 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Good story and jokes. Nice visuals and great music score. Unexpectedly also emotional and touching. Great movie!
"Jun 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not the wittiiest children's cartoon, but very entertaining nonetheless, mainly carried by the incredible chemistry between Antonio Banderas & Salma Hayak.

The action sequences are colorful and well choreographed; the humour, while skewing towards a younger audience, isn't completely juvenile. Plus this film is beautiful, reminiscent of the Spider-Verse style.

Overall really enjoyable. 8.6/10, B+
Like Top Gun: Maverick, this film has no business being so much better than the original. 

3D: 8.5/10. Definitely watch this in 3D if you get the chance. Best I've seen since Shang Chi (but I still need to watch Avatar: TWoW)"
"Jun 14, 2023",POSITIVE,The storyline is amazing and couples well with the other puss and boots shows/movies. With great animation and voice acting it is a must see. The story really shows what a good villain can do and teaches how comforting a friend can be in tough times.
"Jun 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots movie was very wonderful, creativity from dreamworks, the drawing was very special, it deserves 5 stars"
"Jun 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Totally lives up to the hype. I'm really glad I saw this in theaters. This was such a beautiful, immersive movie. The big bad wolf was an amazing and truly scary villain."
"Jun 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Literally a perfect film. I was blown away by the cinematography and the brilliant plot, not to mention it's absolutely hilarious without the try-too-hard feeling many of the other Shrek movies have. Did I mention the soundtrack is also phenomenal? Or that Death is literally the best ""villain"" animation has ever seen? So many things to praise about this film!"
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was really good in my opinion.
I like the contrast between puss beging his normal ever So cocky self and his realization of it.
Animation was good
Jokes were actually genuinely good
Voice acting was great
Good job Pixar 👏🏻"
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic, refreshing, adorable, funny. Great sequel with 3 so different villains and so great journey for Puss. Yet Wolf steals the show every scene he appears. Must see!"
"Jun 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Top notch story, intetesting characters (both heros and antagonists , a legitimate villan), amazing special effects. It's a well written story and movie which will go down in history ."

"Jun 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"The animation was fa nominal, Death was a great and scary villain, and the adventure is fun and exciting. This movie makes Disney look like a joke in 2022."
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a brilliantly thoughtful and exciting movie. An epic adventure that can be enjoyed by parents and kiddos.
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Story: 10/10

"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Probably the best movie I've seen in years, complete with good characters, plot development, and stunning animation quality."
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a visually stunning and surprisingly emotional film that puts DreamWorks back to the level of perfect animated movie quality it deserves.
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed this with my daughters.
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,animation is weird and ruined the original puss in boots for me.
"Jun 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, and amazing animation!"
"Jun 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was like a breath of fresh air. This is easily the best animated movie of this year, maybe even this decade."
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Engaging. Well written and beautiful. So Fresh.
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best dreamworks films, it's definitely for adults and kids"
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,I hope there are more movies like this.
"May 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Mature story with stuff for kids too. The animation is really cool and Puss' arc is so satisfying. Definitely would recommend it.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was equally hilarious and enjoyable. Puss in boots was one of the best animated movies I've seen in a long time.
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie in all of history
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent and funny, multiple laugh out loud moments. Highly recommended. The wolf character can be a little scary but my young daughter loved the film"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme incrível, quero assistir muitas vezes mais!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Filme incrível! Superou minhas espectativas
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Esta película es una obra maestra, un poco sobrevalorada, pero sigue siendo una obra maestra"
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie to watch with the whole family. We saw this in theaters and watched it again at home with our kids and were pleasantly surprised how much we actually enjoyed watching it together. Really great comedic timing, fun references for adults, enjoyed by all."
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was fuckin amazing, Marvel can learn something from them"
"May 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"A MASTERPIECE....
masterpiece"
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's bright, dynamic, funny and touching!"
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Plz make another puss in boots movie ( 1# movie of all time ) ( i watched it 6 times ) one of the best animated films I've seen in years
"May 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Truly impressive how good the visuals are and the storytelling is out of this world.
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I can't say anything about this movie that hasn't already been said, it is absolutely perfect!"
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"We bought this and me (36) and my daughter (12) watched this great movie every day for 13 days. It became a silly but enjoyable thing to do. Perhaps thats what great movies should do, entertain and also create great memories. 

Anyway, a beautiful movie with funny moments, no silly and contrived politics, and great voices."
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was way better than I expected and I love the character development of everyone, each learning a great lesson (or otherwise paying for not learning their lesson)"
"May 24, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie knows how to make good villains
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing animation and storyline, love the characters, especially the main villain! Overall 10/10 would watch again."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Never seen but assume it’s good 
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun, nostalgic, and well animated."
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved this movie for my kids!  They were a little scared at points (6 year old and 3 year old Boys) but the animation was great and the story portrayed a great message my kids could take with them.  Highly recommend and I like it more than the first!
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, great characters, great animation, great cinematography and great voice acting."
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was one of the great surprises of that year, they daringly reinvented it for a new visual approach with a story about ""behind your desire"" that manages to surprise even the most evil with animations, as the characters are incredibly charismatic and win our sympathy in the right measure. Dreamworks has proven that yes, it can make a nearly perfect Puss in Boots movie! It's an even better Spin-Off sequel than some movies in our beloved Shrek franchise!"
"May 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"With Animation reminiscent of the style of Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse, this movie broke from Dreamworks traditional approach, and also from the rest of the Shrek and Puss In Boots franchise to deliver an exceptional movie. This one shone in all the ways that the first Puss in Boots did not. The characters hit harder, even ones that should have been well-established back then, and the story felt elevated on a plane the other one was just not on. This movie pleasantly surprised me, even with the high expectations I went into it with. I highly recommend this film."
"May 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I've been looking into Florence Pugh's filmography and realized she has a small part in this movie. Ordinarily, I wanted to skip this, never being a fan of the Shrek movies, but this is a spinoff, it doesn't have Mike Meyers and Eddie Murphy's annoying voiceovers. Plus, I do enjoy Antonio Banderas' movies from time to time. Not to mention Disney is in a bad place, so why not check out the competition?

Puss in Boots, the jovial adventurer from the Shrek sequel has gone forward since those early days with his spinoff, but after nearly ten years, he returns for a sequel. The brave cat ends up magically dying and coming back to life only to be told that he is on the last of his nine lives and should retire from his adventures. But this is Puss in Boots, and if there is an opportunity to start over again, he will take it when a magical power known as the Wishing Star map has been found, and he wants his nine lives back. But there are others in his way, from foes to friends, on the way to redeem the Wishing Star's wish.

As I mentioned before, I am not a fan of the Shrek series, but I love Puss in Boots. Banderas chews the scenery with his voice as the legendary feline hero, alongside plenty of other voiceovers from Salma Hayek, Ray Winstone, and Florence Pugh. I got to say that Dreamworks makes a great movie, better than anything Disney is making nowadays."
"May 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,The framerate made the movie unwatcheable.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Good funny animated movie. Nothing unbelievably great about it or like my favourite animated movie ever but it's for sure a movie to watch If you need a laugh. But in the end What makes this movie work is how mysterious the wolf was and how funny Puss and Perrito are.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,it was so good!!!! its even better than the first one. the cgi animation is great and don't froget with the caracthers. Death is like one of the coldest vilain ever made.
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,How can a sequel to a secondary character movie be so good?
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,this is my second favorite movie in 2023
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is amazing! Suitable for family! Great time watching it!
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie is great! Nothing but action and lots of humor.
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"There isn't that much that I can say about this movie that hasn't been said already by people on YouTube or other reviewers on the site. This movie is just all around good. On top of giving Puss a facelift that he desperately needed, even if we didn't know, it takes a cue from animation and innovates in such a way that makes the fights look spectacular and the characters fluid. The entire movie was a joy from start to finish, and if I ever have children, this is one of the first movies they are seeing when they hit the age of 10. 
All of the villains are spectacular, the main characters are great, and the story isn't too loaded down with baggage to properly fly. The movie is not only a feast for the eyes but it is also a engaging story experience, one that I found compelling and that resonated with me. 
If you are superstitious or of a more conservative background, the movie might not be as good to you due to it offending your existing values. Otherwise, this movie is a must see for people of all ages and should be used as an example for good storytelling in classrooms."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this movie. My wife and daughter all loved it as well. 
Definitely worth seeing."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This one caught me by surprise! It was visually engaging (with a slightly different art style to older DreamWorks Shrek universe movies) and really made you care about the storyline and characters as an adult viewer! Really great job
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I need to learn how to whistle.
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Os vilões tornaram o filme na coisa toda.
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Was the story great? no. Was the animation great? no. 
It was a terrible mild movie, what is a disappointment for a character that is loved by so many fans. The animation was soo diffrent than the other movies of Puss in Boots that it really annoyed me the whole movie, the eyes look terrible of all the characters, really flat with no live behind them. They should fire the animation team."
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"HOLY FREAKING MOLY. 
This movie deserves all its praise! The writers did a phenomenal job and the animation... the animation... wow! so refreshing and beautiful. To me, this is the best film of 2022 and better than what Disney had come up with for the last 5 years. 
Well done Dreamworks! 
All the praise for this film is so deserved!"
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,film naprawdę super - oglądałem ze 3 razy i jeszcze na pewno kilka razy obejrzę - definitywnie najlepszy film 2022 - kurde nawet się wzruszyłem na nim parę razy
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Went in open-minded and was utterly blown away. Animation stellar, voice acting fantastic and Jack horner was an amazing villain. You must see this film!"
"May 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Puss in boots: the last wish is perfect.
"May 16, 2023",POSITIVE,mestria en animacion e historia
"May 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This animated movie should be taught in film schools on how to make a regular story great, and how to make your characters greater.. Probably the best animated movie since Coco - at least to me.."
"May 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kept hearing how good this movie was. And sheesh, they weren’t wrong"
"May 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme é um pouco pesado para crianças, acho que poderiam pegar um pouco mais leve por se tratar de um conteúdo com classificação Livre. Mas no contexto geral, é um ótimo filme que chama atenção pelo visual, por como o passado dos personagens (com os seus erros e acertos) molda suas personalidades e seus objetivos futuros (fazendo com que os telespectadores tenham mais empatia por eles) e pela bela lição de moral no final."
"May 14, 2023",POSITIVE,A perfect movie that perfectly balances all the aspects that every great movie should have.
"May 14, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed watching this one with my family as It had a great story-line with the familiar cast of storybook characters along with some new ones. I hope they continue on with a sequel to this
"May 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of my favorite childhood movies, because of the characteristic of puss and boots being a adventurous"
"May 14, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is fire asf💪💪
"May 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great family film, lots of emotional ups and downs for the characters and growth"
"May 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really great, much more mature and nuanced than your average children's film. The characters had meaningful arcs and this led to a satisfying conclusion. The animation was gorgeous and the voice cast were perfect. 

You know you have something really special when adults are impressed by the wisdom on offer in the story and a 2 year old can also have a blast. Very excited to see what they do next."
"May 13, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie has the exact visualization of a panic attack!!
"May 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"This, Super Mario, and Coc*ine bear are the greatest three movie stretch ever."
"May 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Great plot and loved all of the characters
"May 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"I didn't step into the theater with particular expectations and I walked out nearly bawling. It's a gem. It's soulful, wholesome, fun and beautifully animated. It unpretentiously tugs on the heartstrings by tackling some of the biggest adult themes like the dread of mortality, midlife crisis and realising the value of the family you choose (or chose you). The editing and pacing also works well and isn't wasteful just to pump up the runtime. One of the must watch films of the year!"
"May 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Not me crying after the movie for no reason other than that it was bussin bussin fr no cap 💀
"May 11, 2023",POSITIVE,best movie ever great animation just amazing bbruh
"May 11, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was like so good all the pants in my house ripped and I gave dreamworks $7 for making such a masterpiece
"May 10, 2023",POSITIVE,It was stunning just amazing made my day.
"May 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a great movie it had a great plot and didnt feel like they were pushing a message down my throat although I watched it for free, it is defenitly worth going to the movie and buying the ticket :)."
"May 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Well, I get what they'd say about ""Puss in Boots"", kinda lil' emotional, but the movie's awesome, though. It has the perfect story, perfect anime inspiration (same with ""Turning Red""), and perfect beautiful colors, too, but...some characters with LGBTQ voices. Anyway, I know the movie is perfect, but from DreamWorks Animation, I dunno, I think they're hidin' somethin'."
"May 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely in the top 5 best animated movies I've seen. The animation and symbolism is amazing . dream-works will beat Disney  if they keep this quality of movies coming.
"May 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie. Great art style and animation feels crisp. The story is great to both adults and kids even if you haven't watched previous films in the Shrek Universe

"May 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolute masterpiece! Didn`t expact the movie is so great.
From story, to characters, humor, action and animation style everything top notch!"
"May 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"The first thing I noticed was the animation style, and even though they may have ripped a couple of pages out of Into The Spiderverse's book, it's certainly a masterpiece. Let's just say, it needs a rewatch because of how awesome this movie is. Honestly, it's probably one of the best-animated movies I have ever seen. This is the movie we needed but didn't know we did. 87438735875387538% recommended."
"May 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's good to watch with the kids. But I multitasked while watching it as it did not hold my attention.
"May 8, 2023",POSITIVE,This was such a well done movie!! The animation was beautiful and the themes were deep. I would watch it again in a heartbeat.
"May 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Eu não tenho palavras para resumir o quanto esse filme traz lições para uma geração, além é claro, de seu belo visual artístico, sendo ele relacionado a pinturas a óleo. Personagens carismáticos e bonitos, também uma história bonita e que apresenta bastante os contos. minha nota é 9.8 de 10, já esperava essa bela obra cinematográfica da dreamworks."
"May 8, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was better than avatar 1 and 2 death the perfect villain

"May 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Il gatto con gli stivali 2 offre interpretazioni, regia, musiche e tematiche che nessuno si sarebbe aspettato da un sequel uscito 11 anni dopo il primo film. Divertente e serio al massimo, consigliato per tutte le età. Dreamworks Is the goat"
"May 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good movie! one of the best villains out there!

"May 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"AM-A-ZING
Never on my wildest dream I would cry while watching an animated movie.
This movie hits home for me. 
A lot of message such as depression and fear of death which is rare nowadays where everything had to be LGBTQ. 
Overall, it's a great and fantastic movie with a good message that relate to a lot of teens and even adults"
"May 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Brilliantly blends children's entertainment and adult themes of loss, fear of death, friendship and family"

"May 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I watched it 7 times in four days, it's safe to say I'm obsessed with this movie. The animation is beautiful, the plot and directing is top notch, and I laughed every time."
"Apr 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a awesome movie 10/10 it's a masterpiece of the art, music, soundtrack, and also the villain death the wolf. Death the wolf is kinda scary because he wants to spare puss in boots so puss in boots tried to get his lives back and he has 1 live left in the wishing star but in the ending then don't need it especially kitty soft paws, Goldi so GO WATCH IT!"
"Apr 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow. Very cat. I liked how the backstories add more depth to all the characters. I was surprised that this was actually funny, like when they come close to swearing. No more fart jokes! As for the visuals, I enjoyed how they changed his character design - I think he looks more cartoonish? I also agreed with the choice to make the framerate slightly choppier in areas to mimic a stop motion effect. Overall, it had a good message, albeit a little corny. Of course, there was your classic 3rd act breakup and misunderstanding. The resolution worked out easier than I would expect, no surprises in the ending. Despite this, I still think it's a beautiful movie. I definitely want to watch the original now."
"Apr 30, 2023",POSITIVE,The biggest and best animated movie of 2023
"Apr 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is tightly written, gorgeously animated, funny, and action-packed. The character work is superb, old and new characters have compelling arcs and no one takes up more screen time than necessary. The film also gets a lot of mileage from its fantastical setting serving the characters while moving the plot forward - it's very efficient. It's rare that any movie, animated or not, is both as thematically rich and generally well-executed as this one. I'm glad it's getting the recognition it deserves."
"Apr 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie! this is how movies should be made.
"Apr 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Rewatched it and honestly its good. The dog is cheesy and has a cheesy voice. Yet he's a good addition to the franchise.
"Apr 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Supera en todo a la primera parte, el estilo de animación es espectacular, totalmente recomendada, las escenas donde aparece el lobo son geniales y el viaje del Gato hacia su superación algo que vale la pena ver."
"Apr 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Excelente animação!!!!
"Apr 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Puss In Boots the last wish definitely deserves an award for the best animated movie in 2022 which is why I give it a 3.5/5.
 -The movie is enjoyable 
 -the plot is really good and there are no plot holes  -the villains in this movie are great especially the main villain"
"Apr 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Una película que se nota el amor y la entrega que le pusieron al proyecto.
"Apr 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'll start off and say the ending was pretty predictable BUT overall, it was such a fun and entertaining story with good laughs throughout. I really enjoyed it. It was a good surprise to enjoy with my son."
"Apr 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Me encantó..... magistral interpretación de Antonio y Salma. (Recomendada).
"Apr 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just perfect in all ways possible.
Great animation, story and the villains.
Definitely recommend it's worth your time."
"Apr 28, 2023",POSITIVE,This a must see for the whole family.
"Apr 28, 2023",POSITIVE,the fact that this movie comes from the same franchise as shrek is something i will never understand. this movie is basically perfect and a brilliant story for our favourite fearless hero
"Apr 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was okay . I wouldnt go back tho
"Apr 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Oh, what a adorable feel good adventure. The characters had us entertained and crying at the end. Well done."
"Apr 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Late Review but this movie adaptation got me off guard and amazed at the same time. Keep surprising us.
"Apr 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is too good, go give it a watch whether your a kid or a adult"
"Apr 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was positively surprised by the film, compared to its predecessor, the narrative and animation evolution is remarkable, with 1 hour and 40 minutes of well-qualified entertainment. I really liked it."
"Apr 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible animation and a genuinely great story make this my favourite animated movie of the past few years. I've lost count how many times I've rewatched it!
"Apr 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is an absolute must watch. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish gives everything in a movie that I can ask for; A great plot, characters, and growth of the main character. A great sequel. For my extended review I will speak on aspects of the movie so if you do not want to be spoiled please do not read. First I would like to talk about Puss and his growth as a character. I absolutely love the way Puss goes from a prideful, arrogant, and irresponsible cat to something more mature and less reckless.  He learns that he is not indestructible and that he feels fear. Through this realization Puss does not run away from his problems anymore and decides to instead go head first into his biggest fear. Death. Which leads me to my second aspect of the film, the antagonist. In the movie there is a bundle of side antagonist who actually have a purpose and fit the story well. Each with their own motives and the writers did a great job explaining what they were after and why in such a short time. The lead antagonist Death was by far the best aspect of not only the film but also the development of Puss. He shows that Puss is both vulnerable and scared which leads him to face his fears and fight Death head on. Such a great antagonist to a great film. I would suggest leaving the franchise as it is and to not make a third movie so that they can't potentially ruin everything the second movie brought to the table. A must see movie."
"Apr 25, 2023",POSITIVE,The writing and animation in this story is perfection. We have the blue ray and still watch it all the time. Never gets boring.
"Apr 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots The Last Wish is an insanely good film. By far one of the best animated films to release recently. It is exciting, funny, and the story really packs a punch. Cannot recommend this one enough. Go see it!"
"Apr 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"ONE of the BEST DREAMWORKS movie, the Plot, Cinematography, Characters are great"
"Apr 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"A challenge to those who dare claim animation is just child's stuff. It has beautiful artwork, it's funny, heart filled, and has an antagonist who's probably going to go down as one of the best animated antagonist ever. I recommend it, even if you don't have any children to watch with you."
"Apr 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I can't believe this. This is the best animation of the year. My favorite animation of Dream Works. This is a Masterpiece.
"Apr 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best spin-off movie I've ever seen, great casting that actually makes the characters feel so... real, ya know? Plot is over the top, both of the villains were amazing. This is genuinely the greatest movie to end with 2022. 9.5/10"
"Apr 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"esto es oro, se tardaron 11 años en hacer esta pieza audiovisual"
"Apr 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny and hallarious a good family movie for everyone 
"Apr 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film restores your faith that creativity still exists in movie-making (which is even more amazing when it's a sequel).  Clever, funny, heartwarming and charming--'nuff said."
"Apr 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots, is, for the most part, a character that grew up with his audience. 

With this sequel coming out an entire decade after its predecessor, people definitely were not expecting this release. 

It's a rare thing when a sequel, especially a spin-off sequel, is met with open arms from audiences from sightings of a mere trailer, let alone an actual viewing. 

Puss in boots has a gorgeous stylisation, with a unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, that makes use of bold strokes, both within the literal art style and within the story beats themselves. Even the camera direction and angles used, alongside the editing is something that seriously lends to the viewing experience.

With unique character designs and bold, oversaturated use of colours, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, is a film that isn't afraid to lean into its painterly and cartoonish roots to help convey mood and emotion within scenes, in a way that does not in any way retract from the experience. It, alternatively, lifts the viewing experience up immensely with the way in which it is done. 

It's a film that evokes unexpected emotion from the viewer, with scenes that tackle real life issues such as mental health struggles and even the concept of mortality and existential dread, with a realistic and raw approach, in a fashion typically not explored or portrayed in these styles of movie, at-least not with the level of care and tone-appropriate humour the film manages to utilise without denoting the character struggles.

This film also uses an interesting story telling mechanic, employed by having several characters within it that one could consider the ‘true antagonist' of the film depending on either the viewers perspective, or the time within the story as it progresses. The villains in this movie are all very three dimensional, and the level of foreshadowing that comes alongside that, is simply astounding. 

All in all, a film definitely worth a watch, and then another, to catch all of the details you might have missed the first time, thanks to that pesky yet effective foreshadowing."
"Apr 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Animated movie of all time and my new favourite movie of all time!!
"Apr 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It has been a long time since a new aesthetically pleasing villain was introduced in an animation film, whilst the past Puss in Boots movies have been fantastic this latest installation throws the previous into the dust. The animation style is stellar, vibrant and the character art is crisp and flourishing to see with the vfx effects. 

In a more in depth dive into the films pacing, at first the Giant being set up as the 'villain' but immediately losing to Puss set up an interesting perspective of 'who is the villain'. Whilst many would argue death is the main antagonist, he also equally isn't in a sense that his existence sets up Puss's own character development, death isn't evil he is instead a major factor in a characters growth. 

Overall the film takes you along the ride of seeing Puss not only as a character grow but also face his own fears as well as establish a bond with others as well."
"Apr 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a terrific fantasy-adventure film spinning off from the Shrek universe. It follows the story of Puss, the charming fugitive feline who, following a scary encounter with Death, decides to stop his adventuring as he finds out he only has one life remaining. Soon after, his journey begins one again as he finds out the mystical Magic Wishing Star exists, with the ability to grant his one wish – the wish to reclaim his nine lives of course. 

This, however, is not an easy mission as other well-known fairy tale characters with a twist also battle for the wish. Overall, the epic quest is filled with hilarious, hearty and fearful moments, with an incredibly fleshed out storyline jam-packed with emotion and meaning. The film successfully explores themes of friendship, courage, love and ultimately the beauty that one life has to offer.
It is perfectly paced, with the main characters having sufficient and meaningful screen time, as well as an incredible dynamic with each other, and each scene having an importance and relevance. The animation is phenomenal and visually striking, and the action scenes are fast paced, smoothly transitioned, and spread out to keep the film intriguing. It is a one-of-a-kind film which has the ability to appeal to both kids and adults.

I would recommend this fantastic film to people of all ages, as this level of story-telling and striking animation is rare to find in today's cinema!"
"Apr 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Debatably one of my favorite films of 2022. Didn't go with high expectations and left wishing I seen this movie opening weekend. Great watch for kids and adults . With life themes flowing through out the film. Can't wait for shrek 5
"Apr 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's what you expect. If you enjoy these films you will enjoy this one as well.
"Apr 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Dude I loved this movie and death. He was so cool.
"Apr 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great characters, great animation and great story, this move deserved Oscars"
"Apr 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is a fresh new take for the Shrek universe, the animation is awesome, the story is great and the vilain are probably the best part"
"Apr 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Funny yet serious intrigue, interesting characters, this is the best sequel I've ever seen."
"Apr 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Perrito Said A Bad Word But Censored.T_T
"Apr 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"You know how marvel's visual quality got better as their story telling got worse.
Now picture that quality, but with a heartfelt story that feels - just right."
"Apr 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Um bom enredo, ótima qualidade de imagens e cenas emocionantes com suspense"
"Apr 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Captivating and beautifully animated. It's an adventure with yours truly, Puss in Boots."
"Apr 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"amazing movie, a big step up from its predecessor"
"Apr 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing, beautifully animated and a top notch story with memorable heroes and villains."
"Apr 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Some of the best animation and story telling I've ever seen. Incredible messages on anxiety, death, love, found family, and treasuring the life you're living. Best Dreamworks movie (yes, it topped Shrek 2 and Megamind.) Go watch it."
"Apr 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"That was awesome. The animation was ok, the story was good."
"Apr 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good story with good character development. Although this is a kid movie, grown ups can also enjoy it too"
"Apr 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Better Than The First Movie
"Apr 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,The first installment of PIB was just so so and the 2nd part is not much better. By far does not get close to any of the Shrek films. Only interesting for little children.
"Apr 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It's just a work of art
"Apr 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Animação muito legal, levei a família para assistir e gostamos muito"
"Apr 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't usually watch sequels without having seen the first movie, but my family always goes to the movies on Christmas and this was our best option. I was not expecting to like this movie as much as I did, especially because I have grown tired of spin-offs, sequels, and multiverses at the box office. However, this movie delightfully surprised me, and is great on it's own. I loved how like the Shrek franchise, other fairy tale characters are incorporated and modified in unique ways, like Goldilocks and the Three Bears. The animation was entrancing, and I enjoyed how the storyline addressed dark issues, such as death. Overall, this is a great film for children and adults alike, and I am excited to rewatch."
"Apr 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"i loved everything, ratings must be 100%"
"Apr 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Far superior to the first one, this film is beautifully animated, a visual delight, with a much deeper and more mature story, while still being fun for all audiences."
"Apr 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was so much fun and heart warming. Great animated movie!
"Apr 16, 2023",POSITIVE,ES EXTREMADAMENTE BUENAES LA MEJON PELICULA ANIMADA EL GATO CON BOTAS ES BUENA MOMENYO EMOTIBOS UN MU BUEN MENSAJE ALA ADENCIA Y AL LOS NIÑOS BUENA PELI ANIMADA
"Apr 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Man. I never thought a sequel to a shrek spin off would do so good! I could go on for hours and hours but I'm ganna shorted it. The made it realistic and I love it.
"Apr 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing Animation, Plot, Pacing, Design, Characters and also amazing horror film to it, surprisingly dark for a kids movie, portraits puss' story well, his arrogance,loneliness despite being loved by everyone, amazing concept of the 9 lives, that's a fresh take, and overall incredible"
"Apr 16, 2023",POSITIVE,So many life lessons in this awesome movie. Great job Dreamworks!
"Apr 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the animation of this movie. Took 10 years to make another but definitely worth the watch. Death was one of the best villains
"Apr 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best film of the year so far, I can't remember laughing so hard. The characters were fun developed and all contributed in meaningful ways to the overall story. The writing was well done and with respect to all the films that came before this one. I was not expecting to be blown away but this film really out did itself and set the bar for what films should strive for."
"Apr 16, 2023",POSITIVE,But if you know the legendary movie
"Apr 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A beautiful and energetic animation, well worth watching! ^^"
"Apr 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Just a great film all around!
"Apr 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"it may be animated but its not a kids only movie, it has funny moments for kids, and more serious themes for teenagers and adults. it somehow managed to get 3 villains in the movie and theyre almost perfect. it is funny when it needs to be and sad or scary when it needs to be, and the comic-relief side character actually impacts the story, and the wolf is scary as hell. definetly a must watch."
"Apr 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,It kept me entertained. Yep… that’s all I got. 
"Apr 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I had a lot of high expectations, and a lot of them just weren't met. That being said, it's still a solid film."
"Apr 15, 2023",POSITIVE,The animation of 2d and 3d animation is a brand new era for DreamWorks. Absolutely loved this movie.
"Apr 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing animation, wonderful story. Totally epic, a must watch for sure."
"Apr 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was expecting more Death but the movie is still amazing, a must-see"
"Apr 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"A masterpiece. Look how well-handled each character (especially the villains) are; no character here is wasted, and the ""simple and predictable"" storyline is perfectly executed."
"Apr 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Perfection for all ages.  The animation is creative, the jokes are actually funny, and the protagonists all have a genuine and heartwarming arc.  This movie never steps on an emotional moment for a cheap laugh, and commits to what it is trying to say about family, friendship, and living in the moment."
"Apr 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies I’ve seen in years, from a “kids” movie!!!?! "
"Apr 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"ESTA PELÍCULA ES SIMPLEMENTE INCREÍBLE, tan divertida y entretenida. Sin duda merecía EL OSCAAAAR"
"Apr 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kindove overated, but definitley better than the first one. GREAT ANAMATION!!! THE DEATH WOLF WAS AWESOME!!!!"
"Apr 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Animated movie of the year ! Visuals, characters (especially the main villain and his whisle), music, humor... No complaints"
"Apr 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"An absolute gem! Dreamworks wrote a great story with one of the coldest villains in history, and it was all worth the wait. I forgot the entire plot for the first film going into this one so I just thought I would go ahead and enjoy it no matter what. And I did just that. This movie is a story of comedy, friendship, and adventure with a great lesson on making sure you live life to the fullest and don't take it for granted. Perfect for the kids and a great choice for family movie night."
"Apr 14, 2023",POSITIVE,the best movie of all time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Apr 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"The witty humor and interesting animation style was fun, I'd recommend this movie for smaller children. Great for the family."
"Apr 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"""I'm Death, Straight Up."""
"Apr 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"The whole film is like a colourful explosion of passion and quality. Blows the original out of the water- and pretty much everything else animated that has come out recently. The last time I was this much in awe by an animated film, was Frozen 2. It's hard to find anything bad about this movie. All the characters are instantly memorable, which is fantastic. Death takes the cake though. He was just so damn cool. Give the person who designed him a trophy or something."
"Apr 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"The delivery from Antonio Banderas sounds like it's getting old, but DreamWorks resurrects this franchise with a sparkling new coat of paint, and more winsome interpretations of classic fairytales for a lightning-paced new adventure that comes with surprisingly dark themes. ￼"
"Apr 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great story telling. Really enjoyed it.
"Apr 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Me and my siblings loved and enjoyed every minute of it!
"Apr 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun, heartwarming and filled with joy and wisdom.  This was a grand time and very creative in every way. Well done!"
"Apr 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very funny movie. Excellent story, with curiously memorable support characters and villains. Best movie I've seen this year for sure. 5 stars."
"Apr 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"A cute, funny and worthwhile continuation of the Shrek franchise. Looking forward to Shrek 5!"
"Apr 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"After a longer while this was a movie that was funny, emotional, action packed and had compelling story. Big thank you to everyone involved."
"Apr 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another awesome Puss in Boots story. Really Loved the movie. Story was also great, Voice acting were on point. Jokes were not cringy. I liked it even a bit more than the first one."
"Apr 13, 2023",POSITIVE,i saw this movie and i love puss in boots as well as shrek also SHREK 5 IS FINALLY CONFIRMED LETS GOOOOO!
"Apr 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was one of the best movies this decade. You can feel the time and effort, love and care put into this movie. It has a beautiful blend of comedy, action, adventure, and cats. The plot was creative. Who would think of a cat who is on his last life and is literally running from death. (Which is used metaphorically)"
"Apr 13, 2023",POSITIVE,A perfect movie. This movie is better than anything disney did in the last 20 years.
"Apr 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a great film. It's fun, exciting, serious, and sometimes scary. The film manages to capture so many emotions for such a short film. The animation is one of the best I have every seen and is very stylized. Please watch this!"
"Apr 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"A rarity in Hollywood today - a movie that entertains.  Probably the best film ever made in the Shrek series, or at least of the Puss in Boots series.  Ostensibly a kid's film, this has something for everyone.  My teenagers, wife and I all loved it. It has wild half anime visual style, crazy action scenes, fairy tale craziness (although that shtick has dropped off since the original Shrek).  The humor is not wall to wall, but organic, and almost always lands.  But more importantly, it has more mature themes of coming to grips with mortality and life priorities.  It is an emotional roller coaster and really well done.  Yeah it is a little cartoonish sure, but it IS a kids' film."
"Apr 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Good! I love cats so much! ❤️
"Apr 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Uno dei migliori film di animazione di sempre, sopratutto per gli orsi Napoletani. Ottima grafica, buona storia e ottima caratterizzazione dei personaggi."
"Apr 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Simplemente espectacular, entiendo porque Pinocho le gano el Oscar, pero el dibujo y el juego de planos, su cínico villano y el lobo como catalizador de nuestro héroe para que valorara su última vida fue más que una película de domingo."
"Apr 12, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was amazing
"Apr 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If I thought this had anything to do with the original fairy tale, I was seriously mistaken. Apart from very few witty references (the Mafia etc.), this was just a mindless collection of characters crashing into something or beating each other up. Half-way through the show, my daughter said: Daddy, I have enough of this. Can we go home now? - Well done, my girl, for not being fascinated by on-screen violence, even if this may have put you off going to the cinema for the rest of your life. If I could add some rotten cucumbers, I would."
"Apr 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good! Fun movie to watch with kids
"Apr 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"My whole family loved it! These movies never disappoint. Funny, action filled, and heart warming moments through out."
"Apr 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love this movie. My favorite part is when the cricket was mad at jack and said, JACCKKKKKKKKKKKK..... YOUR HORRIBLE, YOUR WISH IS HORRIBLLEEE...... YOU'RE HORRIBLLLLEEEEEEE."
"Apr 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"I literally cannot think of a single thing to complain about. This is the best movie I've seen in a long while. I'm about to go watch it again. The characters are interesting. The animation is gorgeous. I am wondering whether they developed a new way to animate fur cause I've never seen it like this before. You can easily watch this without having seen the first Puss in Boots movie.
Also, no spoilers, but how the dark forest is connected to the map is super cool."
"Apr 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"DreamWorks representou nesse filme, eu achei no inicio que seria um filme sem graça, com animação exagerada, focada apenas para crianças de 5 anos.
Mas este foi muito além, trazendo várias mensagens, principalmente sobre valorizar a vida e aproveita-la.
Os vilões são muito bons mesmo, João Trombeta e Lobo, conseguiram ser ótimos vilões onde um voce sente raiva e o outro voce sente medo.
A arte do filme é maravilhosamente incrivel. Sinceramente este filme acertou em vários pontos, e é impossivel alguém se arrepender de assisti-lo"
"Apr 11, 2023",POSITIVE,It's teaching us what anxiety it is
"Apr 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'll be honest I didn't want to watch this movie. It just didn't appeal to me. But my high school students kept telling me how great it was. Finally I cracked and I am happy to say they were right. I am so happy I watched this film. It was a deep, well written, visually compelling movie that has some really great moments and characters. Life lessons are learned in this movie and characters actually grow. For me the Wolf and Goldilocks really stand out but almost every character is worthy of a shout out. This is one of the best animated movies out there."
"Apr 11, 2023",POSITIVE,I love the movie. It's one Of the best animated films that Dreamworks has created.
"Apr 10, 2023",POSITIVE,What a joy!   My kids absolutely loved this!!   Solid watch for kids and parents!
"Apr 10, 2023",POSITIVE,The volume of his fart sounded like a volcano 🥵🥵🥵 but talking cats funny 🤣🤣🤣🤣🫃🫃🫃🫃🫃🫃🫃
"Apr 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"AMIGOS MIOS, DREAMWORKS REVIVIO AHORA SI POR COMPLETO."
"Apr 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,where the F@#k was shrek
"Apr 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly the best movie I saw that year. This is a kids movie but it has so many mature themes, like personifying death (Puss, aka Catt) and coping with abandonment and rejection (Perrito, aka Dog), and rejection (Kitty). By far one of my favorite movies now."
"Apr 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"A beautiful animated film that took inspiration from Sony's ""Into the Spiderverse"". The Puss In Boots sequel is miles better than the first film with a villain 10x better and a more mature and deep story that fits along the lines of Shrek 2. The writing teaches the main character of his sense of mortality and his lack of care for his safety. The daredevil cat learns how to value life and the people that love him that he must cherish because no one is immortal and the time we have is valuable."
"Apr 10, 2023",POSITIVE,friends we finnaly made it I did see the movie and it was a great movie you must see it
"Apr 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is amazing!
It takes things to the next level!
OMG! The villains are soooo good in this movie!!"
"Apr 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dream Works pleasantly surprised me with this one. I didn't expect much, but Puss in Boots: the Last Wish, an absolutely adorable and hilarious animated movie has some deep themes and messages behind it. As well as it's main antagonist - Death. There's something much to talk about, but it's simply the best movie of 2023 and one of my favourite animated movies so far. 100% recommended!!!"
"Apr 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Risas, buena animación e historia."
"Apr 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was amazing, the mix with 2D and 3D animation was great (which Spider-verse did the same), the soundtrack was great I even put some of the songs in Spotify, the story and the morals were great with Puss changing for the better. The villains were also great: Puss in boots protagonist who had a great character development, Kitty Softpaws being badass and sarcastic I really like her relationship with Puss in boots they're so cute together, Perrito who I thought was gonna the funny annoying dog but I was wrong he wasn't annoying, Jack Horner being funny he is just straight up evil he knows that and he doesn't care which is funny, and of course Death (the wolf) was scary and cool. It was the first movie that I watched twice in cinema which says something, can't wait for Shrek 5 hope they'll use the same animation and have an interesting plot.

I really wish that we would see Kitty and Puss getting married in Shrek 5."
"Apr 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This was a classic DreamWorks film. it had everything we expected, and a little bit more. This is a great one for parents to enjoy with the kids."
"Apr 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Gato de botas 2 nos trás um roteiro muito agradável que mistura o esteriótipo de desenho animado para crianças e uma história sombria e bem construída, cada uma dessas partes representadas por João Trombeta, um vilão que é mau só por ser mau e A Morte, que não é má mas ganha o aspecto de ""vilão"" por se antagonizar com o Gato. Um filme suave o suficiente para as crianças mas ainda é profundo o suficiente para agradar os adultos"
"Apr 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish it's an amazing movie, it's the best dreamworks has ever made. The cuteness of the cat is immense and the film is very well done"
"Apr 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best animated movie of 2022. 10000000000000000008293649273

"Apr 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A formulaic adventure. Little in the way of wit or wonder. No surprises and predictable outcomes. For an undemanding primary school child, perhaps."
"Apr 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Actually the best dreamwork movie for the past decade
"Apr 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Style was amazing, wasnt dragged out into being 3 hours long, cinematography was very impressive and the animation was very creative, but my favourite part has to be the death character. So well done he gave me chills."
"Apr 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hilarious movie! Love the villains, especially Big Jack Horner."
"Apr 9, 2023",POSITIVE,About what you'd expect from another installment of the Shrek franchise.  But the animation in this was top-notch.
"Apr 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible animation, great characters, and a smooth plot help The Last Wish become an extremely good experience."
"Apr 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is in my opinion one of the best animated movies in the past several years. It was so very refreshing to see that it's not a cheap cash-grabs that most animated movies are today (especially considering it's a sequel!). The art, story, writing, acting, everything seemed so passionately made. This movie, along with Spiderverse, make me feel excited and relieved for the future of animation!"
"Apr 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked soo much this movie, the history and the animations, there are just incredible"
"Apr 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Like it's predecessors, Puss in boots the last with is a fun interpretation of fairytales and nursery rhymes. It also includes great messages about found family and death. Even if you haven't seen the first movie, or any of the Shreck movies, you can still enjoy this."
"Apr 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Great animation and good story
"Apr 8, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is more targeted at people between 15 and 23. The age group than most likely watched the first movie. This movie is fun and hilarious to watch for anyone any age. This is what peak entertainment looks like in a kids movie.
"Apr 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is simply wonderful, it exceeded all my expectations. The movie takes the universe created in Shrek to a new level. Artistically speaking, the film is a feast for the eyes, a great explosion of creativity on the screen."
"Apr 8, 2023",POSITIVE,This was an amazing movie!
"Apr 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyable, funny, wholesome. Everything you'd want in a family-friendly movie!"
"Apr 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"An amazing movie with the subject of dealing with death and coming in term with their own mortality. I watched this movie three times and enjoyed it every single time. Even though the theme might sound a bit dark, it got me laughing quite a bit. All the characters were well fleshed out and I never felt overwhelmed with the large cast of characters. It's a movie for all age groups and if you haven't watched the movie yet, go watch it. You won't regret it."
"Apr 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Short and so much fun. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is kind of dark for a kids movie. I was really digging what it had to say and the way death is portrayed is captivating. It's funny, great animation, and above all has a lot of heart to it."
"Apr 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is perfect it is funny, stunning, fearful and amazing there is nothing bad about this movie"
"Apr 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"An excellent warm family friendly film, with great animation and a good solid story about embracing and living life to its fullest, finding meaning in the face of your own mortality and making the most of the time you have with the people you love."

"Apr 7, 2023",POSITIVE,I find the storyline is clean and original. Love love love!
"Apr 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Great animation. Always makes me laugh and cry
"Apr 6, 2023",POSITIVE,PUSS IN BOOTS 2 IS LIKE THE MOST FUNNIEST AND ENTERTAINING MOVIE IVE EVER SEEN
"Apr 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This may just be my favorite movie of all time. Not the best movie, The Prince of Egypt and A Beautiful Day in The Neighborhood are the best movies I've seen, but Puss In Boots: The Last Wish is a must-watch. Even as someone who didn't like the first movie, I think this movie soars in every aspect. Puss, Kitty, and Perrito are a great cast of main characters, each of which feel grounded and entertaining at the same time. This movie having 3 villains could have made it feel overstuffed and like it was doing too much, but no one villain takes time from the others and they're all so well written. Jack Horner is a refreshing villain, he is completely irredeemable and evil, something that Disney should do more with its villains if they ever decide to have an actual villain again. Goldilocks and the 3 bears are incredibly sympathetic, well written characters, they're some of my favorites. Wolf was so threatening, generating chills any time he was onscreen. The animation of this movie is so stylized and gorgeous and puts what the first Puss in Boots did to shame. The music is great, ""Fearless Hero"" is one of my favorite songs from a movie, there's a reason everyone remembers this song after seeing this movie. I could go on and on, but you get the point. Puss In Boots: The Last Wish is an uncontested masterpiece, by far my favorite Dreamworks movie"
"Apr 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was pretty funny, the graphics were ok, the only thing is that the storyline was confusing to understand and didn't quite understand why some random characters appeared in this movie."
"Apr 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots is great for many reasons.  First, it's super funny! Second, it's got a good message.  Third,  I am really impressed with is how it leaves out divisive political ideologies.  It's a great classic movie!"
"Apr 6, 2023",POSITIVE,It was the best movie ever of 2022
"Apr 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful masterpiece. Fresh, engaging animation style, timeless subjects tackled (death, meaning/purpose of life, anxiety, trust), great characters and development."
"Apr 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing writing, story, visuals, animation and great lessons, it's a must-watch for any type of person no matter the age!"
"Apr 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"My lord, this is one of my favorite animated movies I have seen, the art the music and the story telling where a masterclass on what to do right, amazing."
"Apr 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best animated film in years. Wonderful story, animation, voice acting and characters."
"Apr 6, 2023",POSITIVE,This is one of the best definitions of must watch and perfect movies this is a 1000/10 movie on all aspects i simply love it!
"Apr 5, 2023",POSITIVE,The main cat never disappoints!!!  Puss in Boots is awesome and this movie is beyond awesome!!!  Love it!!!
"Apr 5, 2023",POSITIVE,the animation was amazing. this movie gave a lot of what i missed in newer animation movies.
"Apr 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Probably the best Shrek movie, knows how to play with its legacy and sincere presentation of new characters"
"Apr 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow I don't have words to say about these masterpiece the animation passed to be realistic to be like into the spider verse it's a pretty good movie with great villains and a great message I love it.
"Apr 5, 2023",POSITIVE,A top tier comedy movie. Laugh after laugh after laugh. Plus the animation is excellent. 10/10!
"Apr 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not full 5/5 stars because I think that the only issue this film had was the fact that it took too long time to get the adventure going, like while i enjoyed puss trying to retire at this weird ""cat home"" it did feel like we were there a little bit too long and I did wanted the plot to start moving but once it got moving it was an incredibly engaging experience that shattered my expectations completly. Not just exciting but also surprisingly mature and thoughtful and sometimes thrilling, it really is the package and eaisly the best animated film of 2022."
"Apr 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie has a mix of good things. Pleasing animation, exciting action sequences, compelling characters, excellent antagonists, a surprisingly poignant theme, and masterful storytelling. There is just so little to complain about. Easily one of the best Dreamworks movies."
"Apr 5, 2023",POSITIVE,The prefect movie for gigachads
"Apr 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Must see funny to see puss in boots go through his lives great movie to see with the kids
"Apr 5, 2023",POSITIVE,So much fun the animation is beautiful I want more
"Apr 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Far too scary for young children. Not suitable or particularly enjoyable, or even funny. Contains unnecessary horror, distress, weapons, and blood."
"Apr 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"personalmente cuando la vi me encanto la forma de la animación, pero sentí muy forzado meter tantos villanos en menos de 7 minutos, la muerte tiene un diseño muy intimidante, es una gran lástima que la película se sienta muy apresurada por el poco tiempo que dura."
"Apr 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"yo know who joe is?, Joe mama HAHAHA"
"Apr 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Nearly perfect! IMHO this movie should have won the Oscar for best animated film. I've seen Pinocchio's Netflix movie and I agree it was a very good animated film and they did an amazing job. But Puss and boots the last wish was an original story that had me laughing and crying all at the same time. One of the best in the Shrek franchise! The reason it did not win an Oscar was because its animated style in some parts were too much like Spider-Man's multiverse animation movie. Which wasn't too good. A part from that, the movie as a whole was an A+."
"Apr 4, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Shrek movie since the second one!
"Apr 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in boots is a fantastic movie. I'm an adult and fortunately movies like this allow me to escape from the everyday struggle. My family knows that when I get in a low spot I watch my favorite few movies on repeat just because they make me feel good and this has definitely been added to me list. Not only is the movie constantly entertaining but the details that go into it make it so that every time you watch it you notice something new. And the movie score is fantastic. 
It's a fantastic movie. In my opinion this is one of dreamworks best animations and films in general."
"Apr 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Gorgeously animated with surprisingly mature emotional beats. The humor was pretty delightful, most of the jokes landed for me. This is a definitive step up from Bad Guys, which itself was a good movie, DreamWorks is really perfecting that Spider-verse inspired look! Absolutely blows the first Puss in boots movie out of that water!"

"Apr 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a great film, amazing animation, anime influence obvious, hilarious comedy, terrific voice acting - Florence Pugh as Goldi was so different than her usual voice, almost a Cockney accent! Glad it's doing well in the theater so we get more of these great movies!"
"Apr 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Best animated movie in a long time. Take notes Disney.
"Apr 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was very funny and an absolute delight. We need a Goldilocks and Bears spinoff, please."
"Apr 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you want to see a familie movie, you should watch this one. It's extremely well written. Can't think of another movie that tops this one."
"Apr 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"There's almost nothing wrong with this film. I enjoyed everything from the stunning Spider-Man into the Spiderverse inspired animation style to the humor (especially from Big Jack Horner) to the plot and characters. One thing I don't like as much with this movie is the fact that there is 3 villains (6 if you think about it) so I feel like 1 of them could have been unessecary, even though the movie never felt crammed. Another thing is the predictable ending. (SPOILERS) Puss and Kitty both give up the wish at the end and the message is ""everything you need is already in front of you"" Good for all ages- maybe a bit scary for little kids at times."
"Apr 1, 2023",POSITIVE,So good it made me make a rotten tomatoes account just to give it 5 stars
"Apr 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is a masterpiece, perfectly blended the characters and the meaning of the film. The characters are so full and real. I havent seen a movie on this level the Avengers infinity war. Please go watch."

"Mar 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was really good. Fun story and plot, good characters, etc. Death was such a good villain"
"Mar 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"When this movie came out, I had little expetations so I didn't even bother to see it, but seeing all of the hype it was getting, I couldn't miss it, and holy moly, what is this movie. It didn't have to be this good, but it was. The story is awesome and the visuals stunning. Would totally watch it again."
"Mar 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Una película muy fresca tanto en historia como en animación, un muy buen trasfondo y desarrollo. Me encanto."
"Mar 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great movie, without many flaws. There's nothing I dislike about this movie. Although, at first I disliked Perrito, but he grew on me enough that at the end of the movie, I forgot that I disliked him. Other than that, everything was great: the animation, the action scenes, and the story's pretty good. Definitely, a must-watch if you're a fan of Your Favorite Fearless Hero."

"Mar 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Terrific voice work as always by Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots, and Salma Hayek is charming as Kitty Softpaws. The story takes some welcome, surprising turns. Some dark moments with the Wolf/Death may be frightening for sensitive young viewers."
"Mar 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Dreamworks may have a mixed output of Quality but puss in boots 2 proofs that they can blow everyone away.
"Mar 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it was an awsome film will watch again need to buy it death was awsome

"Mar 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I mean if you don't know how good this movie is yet well what took you so long idiot.
"Mar 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'll be honest, I'm not really fond of the Shrek franchise, or even the original Puss in boots. But The Last Wish is a DreamWorks masterpiece with it's characters, charming plot, creative villains and heartfelt message on life. For a sequel ten years later, this is what I needed."

"Mar 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,We went as a family. I found it to be violent for my daughter. Who Is  eight years old. She was frightened at the work who appeared to death and all of the violent scenes. She could not sleep and has been talking about now how scared she is of the dark. I would not recommend it at all. The adults that attended in the movie theater kept covering their kids eyes. Why would a movie be so violent for their age?
"Mar 26, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was a wonderful surprise too me. Beautiful animated and a great story.
"Mar 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"W DreamWorks

"Mar 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"(SPOILER WARNING) (TLDR AT THE BOTTOM)

This is what animated kids movies should be like. Behind all of the bright colours of the gorgeous animation, making all of the action scenes an absolute spectacle to feast your eyes onto, is a simple plot with an absolutely massive impact. 

The story is light hearted enough so kids can get enjoyment out of it, but it also treats its audience with maturity, not playing safe and having the ‘bravery' to insert extremely deep messages. One of which is the over-arching theme of mortality and how we need to appreciate what we have.

This theme is represented beautifully through its characters. The protagonist puss in boots learns how he has taken his lives for granted. He learns this through the other characters such as Perrito. 

At first glance he seems like the cliché annoying side character for comic relief, but turns out being a warm, friendly and extremely likeable little chap. The fact that he does not have a wish, along with some other character traits, shows us and puss how he is content with the life he has, and only looks forward to his simple dreams, letting the rest develop along the way. His dream is to become a therapy dog, which is an important detail to note further into the film. 

Of course I cannot review this movie without mentioning Death, one of the best animated villains I have seen in a while. He shows puss his hatred towards him for taking his lives for granted, and enjoys inflicting fear into other people. In his introduction scene he is extremely close to taking puss' final life, coming as close to a scar on his forehead, with one drop of blood slowly creeping down to his shocked face. (Another example of this film's maturity) in this scene we see puss experience true fear for the first time in his life, as he is petrified of dying right there, right then. This is the moment he comes to realise how much he has taken for granted, and it was all at the fault of this menacing wolf character.

But it doesn't stop there, he constantly torments puss, showing up throughout random parts of the film, in which every appearance, send massive chills down puss' and my spine, with his truly uncanny whistle. 

One of these appearances leads to what is in my opinion one of the most powerful scenes in the film. Puss begins to run away in a state of absolute to panic before coming to a stop. We see that he is struggling to breathe, and his vision is blurry. Perrito is the only one there, and without any dialogue, Perrito simply rests his head on puss' chest, and in a slow decent into calmness, puss regains his control. Perrito has completed his dream of being a therapy dog. The shear realism of this scene, along with the mature dealing of the situation is what makes this scene, and this film in general truly one of a kind. 

To finalise, we also have many other great characters, most notably, Goldi the three bears, the redeemable villains who learn to appreciate their family, and Big Jack Horner, the pure evil villain who does not appreciate what he has at all, to which he learns to consequences. Overall he is an extremely funny character with a ‘charming evil' to him. All of these characters are balanced out perfectly through the films perfect pacing. Nothing seems to drag on at all.

TLDR:
This movie is an incredible creation. All the characters are amazing in their respected ways, the animation is a true spectacle of passion and creativity, and the plot is simple, but truly impactful with the balance of light hearted humour and the downright mature themes. 

Personal experience:
I have never felt so much towards a film before, the mature themes especially hit hard and really made me look over how I spend my one life. I would honestly not recommend this film to really young audiences, because this film is best experienced when you truly understand the mature tones and messages. I absolutely adored this film, and I hope you did as well.

P.S. this is my first proper review of a film, so sorry if some parts are a bit confusing, and the pacing on this is no where near as good as the films lol. There's so much to say but I don't want this to be too long. But still if you made it this far, even if skipping to the TLDR, thanks for reading, hope i expressed my opinions well enough."
"Mar 26, 2023",POSITIVE,it was actually so funny
"Mar 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty good! Kept my six year old entertained with minimal squirming in his seat.
"Mar 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of moral message There. I like it so much.
"Mar 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I saw Puss in Boots: The Last Wish with my sister yesterday and it was an amazing movie. There were a lot of characters that I couldn’t keep track of but I liked the animation style and the story was really fun. I really loved Perrito the dog and also Kitty Softpaws and Puss in Boots.
"Mar 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent! Weve seen it twice in the theater so far. Loved the storyline, the animation, the soundtrack, and the graphics. Very emotional, too youll laugh a lot, youll at times be on the edge of your seat with suspense, and youll cry for sure (happy tears).
 Puss in Boots is at his very best in this movie. Also: Got really attached to Perrito and hope to see him again in the next installment!"
"Mar 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Without a doubt one of the best movies of 2023. Good for all ages.
"Mar 25, 2023",POSITIVE,A very engaging film for funny and one of the best kid freindly movies ive seen in a long time with to notch aniation
"Mar 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"second best movie of all time. shrek is the best, but thats why this is in 2nd death, puss, and jack rivived this spinoff series"
"Mar 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I watched this film with my friend and let me tell you this is probably the best movie of 2022 at least in my top three because this movie is not just a kids film. It's a film that anyone can enjoy. I don't think I really have any real big problems with this film because the animation is super vibrant the characters are lively, even the villains, Jack and death are some of the best, animated villains or even just villains in general that I have seen in a long time there's a big complaint about this movie being too crowded but I think it's just fine. The first half really makes it feel like a Puss in boots film but by the end, it really flashes out all the other characters in Waze I didn't expect, and I love this film for doing that. I really don't know how Shrek five would top this but if it does, then respect because this film was incredible I don't think it's as good as Shrek two, but it is darn close also, I watch this film with my friend after I watch this film you'll never guess what I watched after I watch this film again for a second time it's that good 9/10"
"Mar 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, too many commercials before movie began"
"Mar 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Surprisingly good.  I don't think as good as Shrek, but still good."
"Mar 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Puss in Boots The Last Wish... Underwhelmed, under performed, used ""anime"" looking animation in several scenes. It was not worth my time. Rent or buy the 2011 1st movie."
"Mar 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is the best sequel that we could have gotten from this character. The animation style inspired from into the spider-verse, the great lesson this movie teaches, and the cast really gives it their all. Even death is the best antagonist we have gotten so far in the year."
"Mar 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"An incredible movie!! Visually stunning, very witty, shares a good message, genuinely funny and shows a side to Puss we never saw before. The bleeped out language was some of the funniest jokes of the movie. Made me cry three times. The animation of the action scenes was fantastic (it played around with the frame rate and had 2D elements in it.) It realistically showed what being scared or having a panic attack feels like. The antagonist is masterfully designed and genuinely scary. This movie is seriously a must-see for any age."
"Mar 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked it, I really liked it. I liked it a lot."
"Mar 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Clean movie. My teens and preteen enjoyed it immensely. Fun characters without cliche stereotypes. My kids loved the way the story was told and loved the animation. Just a fun story without politics. My son was very entertained, a tall order."
"Mar 25, 2023",POSITIVE,A dark and expertly crafted film for all ages.  It feels like a movie made for adults that kids can also enjoy!
"Mar 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'm disappointed in the amount of cursing in the movie and several other things. They say ""what the hell,"" ""crap"" (x2), and they have actual bleeps multiple times like someone is cursing in an adult movie. The characters tell each other to ""shut up""  and call each ""stupid"" and ""idiot."" The theme of death was too strong for my 5yo and they show blood from a facial wound twice. This is a Disney movie. One character was Death and one character said that he was dead on the inside. All completely inappropriate."
"Mar 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Animação espetacular, roteiro muito bom. Já assisti 2 vezes e irei assistir pela 3."
"Mar 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I can't believe we paid money to see this. They kept talking about murder and death like it's nothing. There are many references inferring that someone will be hurt I horrific ways. I'm disappointed that majority of people don't see anything wrong with hearing ‘shut up' in a movie for kids and seeing PG rated violence. This is not even close to Shrek, which was a really cute, innocent, and funny movie for all ages."
"Mar 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Humor both kids and adults can enjoy
"Mar 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie, it has great animation and a great story. I loved the messages he conveys, and everyone can identify with the characters. The wolf is just perfect, and yes he is very scary, he has a certain psychological pressure and that brings a great sense of fear and terror, and he was portrayed very well. Congratulations on this film."
"Mar 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lo-key is one of the best movies I've EVER seen. I watched with my family, and we all liked it! It's a great movie that you HAVE to give a watch."
"Mar 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Yes. Go watch this movie. Everyone will enjoy it, not just the kids."
"Mar 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't really know where this came from, but this movie, which was very clearly created to be for kids, has some real material built around solid bones. And that wolf was genuinely unnerving."
"Mar 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"ages 12 to 60 in our group, and we all loved it!  Animation different and exciting, and great theme/moral to the story."
"Mar 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Death is the absolute best villain. That is all I have to say.
"Mar 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,meh; i didn't love it. it lost my attention eventually.
"Mar 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Too loud. Too little plot. Substance substituted by action.
"Mar 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Funny and good story!
"Mar 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fairy tale lore meets surprisingly mature drama. ""The Last Wish"" could have sacrificed the musical numbers for more action scenes, but the emotion throughout the picture was able to keep me engaged with tears rolling down my face throughout."
"Mar 23, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best animation movies the animation The animation itself is amazing the story and the adventure is great and death is one of the best villains if not the best villain i ever saw in a animation movie he reminds me of hermonica from once upon a time in the west becuse of his whistle and strength and puss himself is vary good and antonio banderes is a great voice actor a most watch movie
"Mar 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Immensely creative, hilariously sarcastic, and with so much heart to bring you to tears no matter what age.

The greatest animated adventure I've seen since Spider-Verse!
Stick it to the Disney man."
"Mar 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Most epic movie I have ever seen. Watching it made me spiritually ascend and high five god
"Mar 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was Perfect. Honestly Perfect. Dreamworks having the thought of animating a panic attack is a whole level, I don't know if they have done this before but hell this gave me goosebumps. I felt bad for kitty about her life with puss in the past but they worked it out."
"Mar 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved the movie. The movie scenes worked great with serious, sad, funny, and exciting scenes all working very well together. To many modern movies crack a joke during times meant to be serious or sincere but there are moments in this movie like the time when the Puppy comforts Puss that are very touching and there are no jokes or wise cracks to ruin the moments."
"Mar 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a little scary at first, but I love that at the end😍😍😍😍"
"Mar 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good family movie, with villians and heroes (Puss in Boots & Kitty Softpaws. Our 4 year old grandson enjoyed it and there are funny adult references to laugh about as well. Reminds me of the cartoons we used to watch as kids but obviously, much well produced and with great action parts."
"Mar 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the end the way they stayed together.
"Mar 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This Movie is one of the best animated movies this decade and it deserves the praise it's gotten. This movie is so dark and mature. My favorite scene was when puss is running from death and when Perrito found him snd he calms him down. Death is horrifying and probably one of the best villains iv'e ever seen , Jack Horner is hysterical. The animation is amazing and Goldilocks and the three bears were a funny, and an emotional group with great character arcs. Perrito is a great character with funny jokes and a kind and adorable personality, and his sad backstor
 Iv'e watched this movie 3 times and on my second viewing iv'e noticed that one of the locations in the map when perrito holds it is called the river of relaxation which is where his owners nearly drowned him. Trust, anxiety, fear and emotion is handled so well and there's a lot of things for adults to enjoy. Death is an extremely dark villain and there is some bleeped swearing but that makes this movie the best. This movie took risks and after being stuck in hell for years. Hollywood doesn't respect animation. They think of it as something that is only meant for kids, but movies like this, and many other DreamWorks movies like Shrek, how to train your dragon, Kung fu panda, and Wallace and Gromit the curse of the were rabbit. And to anyone who doesn't like this masterpiece than maybe these kids movies are a little to mature for you."
"Mar 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Trabalho excepcional da DreamWorks, dublagem maravilhosa do Antônio Banderas e Wagner Moura, que deu outro nível a Morte no filme, e como sempre a DreamWorks acerta e faz um vilão maravilhoso igual o Joãozão trombeta, merecidamente uma das melhores animações do ano."
"Mar 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss In Boots: The Last Wish is the best animated movie I've ever seen and the cast and director have nailed yet another Puss In Boots movie. To give this movie a bad rating because of it's scariness is a crime. The PG rating tied to the humor and darkness of the film is to better the age appealing. I would recommend looking into Puss in Boots as well as all the other movies tied to it made by Dream Works before you watch it. Maybe then you'll realize the dark humor that's shown in previous movies that they set you up for. Next time Grandma, don't listen to your grandchildren about what they heard or saw on Social Media and pray for the movies downfall after the 5 year old kids come out of the theater crying."
"Mar 21, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best animation movie i've seen since Kung Fu Panda! I didn't know I really needed this...
"Mar 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"A masterpiece of the movie that surpasses the original by far and keeps you on your toes throughout the film. Also, Fearless Hero is a great song."
"Mar 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Esse filme é muito bom... e que baita vilão é esse Lobo.
"Mar 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The sequel to the Shrek's beloved gato, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish has definitely done the series proud. The soundtrack is outstanding and very fun to listen to. Each character has their own backstory and relationship to the story as a whole. The story itself is simple yet refined in its own unique way with all the characters seeking ""The Last Wish""! From start to finish this is a must see for viewers of all ages! 

When you finally get the chance to see it, you'll think you yourself ""What took ya so long?"""
"Mar 21, 2023",POSITIVE,My grandchildren really enjoyed watching the movie.  Even my 3 year old grandson sat still through almost the whole movie.
"Mar 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I honestly think it's great I've already watched it 3 times, the wolf might be a little scary for the Little 
Kids, great movie over all"
"Mar 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is the best animated movie I have seen in 27 years and leaves many positive messages in each character
Let Dreamworks make more movies like this."
"Mar 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Efectivamente es cine
"Mar 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was fantastic! The best animated movie I have seen in a very long time! The animation is stellar, with great humor, great action, a great story, excellent uniqueness, a great lesson, great acting, great music, just all great! Dreamworks really went SPOT ON with this one, which, in my opinion, is one of the best animated movies ever made!"
"Mar 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Mmmmmm~
such a good movie. 
it has a great story and very charming characters. The visuals are something Dreamworks need to keep. plus shrek world so..."
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Kiddos loved the movie
"Mar 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This was good but can be a bit frightening for younger children. Also the themes (mortality etc.) are a bit adult, but the kids I went with seemed to enjoy the movie!"
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining, good storyline and graphics."
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie ever shouldn't be only 94% audience rating
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was good and much better then recent animation movies. I choose to watch this over Shazam if that’s saying anything.
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"We loved it. Both the 55 year old parents and the 25 year old kids. It was funny, engaging, surprisingly mature and thoughtful. Highly recommended."
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE,bro this is one of the greatest movies i seen and i especially liked the fight between puss and death it was epic and how they introduced the characters was amazing and the scenery ✨beautiful✨ anyone who hasn't seen this movie has no life at all cause it is amazing
"Mar 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was awful. Story was awful. Not funny. This is a PG movie meant for kids. There is a character swearing constantly  and it is bleeped out as a joke but its not funny and its kind of shocking to be honest. I mean its a PG movie lol. One of the villains is always talking about murder. He says the word murder quite a few times for a this kind of movie. Definitely perplexing route they took with this movie. I think the Puss in Boots character is really cool too, but this movie is terrible."
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE,this is a masterpiece the animation is perfect the story is amazing the characters are amazing to.death is so scary it's crazy you must watch this movie
"Mar 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a very good family movie with a great message of the importance of Family!
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is a delightful cinematic experience that not only brings joy to its human audiences but also has the magical ability to charm our four-legged friends, as magnificently demonstrated by Magnolia, the adorable dog who gives it a resounding paw of approval!

This latest installment in the Puss in Boots franchise once again proves that this swashbuckling feline hero is as timeless as fairy tales themselves. The film combines action, humor, heart, and of course, those iconic kitten eyes, to create a story that appeals to viewers of all ages.

Antonio Banderas, who has lent his voice to the character of Puss in Boots throughout the series, continues to shine in the role. His charismatic performance brings a blend of sophistication and endearing goofiness that makes Puss an absolute joy to watch. The character's depth and growth are beautifully portrayed in this film, adding a layer of emotional resonance that is truly heartwarming.

What sets ""The Last Wish"" apart is its ability to capture the essence of classic fairy tales while adding a modern twist. The story is cleverly woven with themes of friendship, self-discovery, and the enduring bond between humans and their pets, which might explain why Magnolia the dog seems to adore it as much as her human companion.

The animation is top-notch, with lush visuals that transport you to a fantastical world filled with daring sword fights, mystical creatures, and breathtaking landscapes. The attention to detail in the character designs and settings is a testament to the dedication of the animation team.

The humor in the film is both witty and slapstick, appealing to a wide range of humor preferences. Whether it's a clever one-liner that makes you chuckle or a comical chase scene that has you in stitches, ""The Last Wish"" keeps the laughs coming throughout its runtime.

And let's not forget the soundtrack, which complements the film beautifully. The music adds depth to the emotional moments and excitement to the action sequences, enhancing the overall viewing experience.

In a world where we often long for stories that make us smile and remind us of the magic of storytelling, ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is a heartwarming gem. It's a film that manages to captivate not only its human audience but also the furry friends who share our homes, making it a true family-friendly adventure.

So, whether you're a devoted fan of the Puss in Boots franchise or just looking for a feel-good movie to enjoy with your loved ones (including the four-legged members of your family), ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is a must-see that will leave you with a warm heart and a big smile."
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Good but a little scary with the wolf
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie and the amount of people working on this was incredible.
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme incrível,animação boa e com o melhor antagonista das animações."
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was funny and exciting. The reaper was a bit scary for kids.
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dude, this movie was perfectly archetypal. It played with valuable themes that make you actually care. That villain is puurrrrrrrfect (see what I did there, like with the cat thing).  I think I liked this equally with Shrek (maybe even more.)."
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This goes so hard. I would recommend this for adults, kids, teens, anyone. It has good jokes, the story is amazing, it pretty much skews over the first movie to tell it's own story while still hanging on to the lore of shrek and (most) of the puss in boots films. It takes a character you've probably never heard of despite being a real poetry character ""Little Jack horner"" and turns him into a heartless villain with no tragic backstory, just straight up evil, and it makes his character really funny, while still having other villains that have motives like goldilocks, who wants to have a real family, and death who wants to take puss's life because he doesn't appreciate it. Honestly, it's an amazing film with top tier animation, and it is possibly the greatest DreamWorks movie."
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I honestly don't have anything bad to say about this movie. The storytelling, character arch, sound design were awesome. But as a 3D artist myself, I must say the style, animation and envoriment design were so good that I would watch the movie again, even on mute, just to appreciate that."
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"No need to elaborate why, just know it was a masterpiece."
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was skeptical as it feels like there are a million Shrek/ Puss in boots movies but this is done very well. The plot is refreshing, there are some emotional parts but also a lot of laughs. I like how it ends with them sailing towards Far Far Away, I am excited to see what comes next."
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it ! Only movie that kept the attention of my 4yr old grandson .  Fun movie to enjoy with kids of all ages .
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I am delighted with this masterpiece . Incredible success in the evolution of the cat's facial expressions and the principle of all animation. The characters of the second plan are perfectly worked out, a separate respect for the fact that they were not afraid to show a little blood,. For the wolf and its design, a separate fat plus. If you haven 't watched it yet, then be sure to watch it !"
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great movie that sees some of the most interesting villains match up against incredible heroes that all showcase wit, humor, and heart. Snappy dialogue and surprisingly funny moments match up alongside sharp action. The new art-style might take some getting used to, but the more painterly aesthetic alongside what an intentional reduction in animation frames lends itself well to a more fairytale book feel while still giving a sense of dynamism.

All in all, a great movie and I can't wait to see where they go from here."
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome watch. Good fun and enjoyable. Must watch.
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was wonderful. From the animation to the creativity from this simple character to a complex and realistic lyrics characterized figure. Ioved the unique message and this movie was really valuable to me. The themes if death make me feel seen and make this one of my favorites.
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is better than full river red combined with america, this movie is the .G.O.A.T."
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Best animated feature of 2022 in my opinion
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"In the sea of what we have gotten the last three years, it's always such a life line to sanity when a studio makes something that really is wonderful!"
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,An excellent story with spectacular visuals and awe inducing sound design. A must see for anyone who enjoys a funny but serious installment in the Shrek universe. A very mature and emotional story just below the surface of a fun adventure film. I would recommend this film to anyone with a taste for adventure.
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Music was great but the best part was Antonio and Selmas voices in Kitty and Puss
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome! so cool i forgot to eat the popcorn!
"Mar 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Fun.  Small plot but fun action
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was very cute and it kept my 7 year old grandson entertained!  That always makes the movie experience that much more enjoyable!
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very fun, clever addition to franchise with smart writing, and enough scares to keep my 8 yo on edge of his seat.  A lot of not so subtle adult humor as well. Highly recommend."
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,That it was a teaching moment and movie that our grandson enjoyed and knows it was teaching about the fact family and friendships are important.  and He loved the movie and so did we.  Need more movies like this to remind the true values of life.
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The animation is great, the story is constantly pulling you in and the humor as expected is hilarious!"
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie the animation was amazing and the characters are great. The movie was also funny but interesting at the same time
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss really makes a wish come true this time around! 
With a colorful cast, peppy one-liners, and a plot that felt completely fresh, Puss nails this with even with claws retracted behind his back!"
"Mar 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Don't care for this movie, all I want is a Shrek and Donkey film like the original shrek film."
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is incredible. The animation is the best I've ever seen, the Goldilocks plot line is amazing, Death is one of the best villains in animation, and this movie is so funny one scene nearly killed me. The only thing keeping me from giving it a five star rating, is that stupid bag of dog crap Jack Horner. An annoying antagonist that I want to murder with a rusty hatchet."
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun and cute, but with deeper meaning. Puss in all his glory. Interesting mix of animation styles. Worth a watch."
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing, outright amazing, DreamWorks took a risk when no one wouldn't, I definitely recommend it to anyone really, P.S if you got a family watching this... IT'S PG FOR A REASON."
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie to watch with the family. My daughter loved the therapy dog.
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolute masterpiece of a film. Everything comes together so beautifully. Not only a return to form but a new, fresh take. Every character does their part perfectly, the dialogue is fun and enjoyable, the plot is complex but easy to follow, the voice acting is off the charts, the music and soundtrack are all done to perfection, and the ending is satisfying and fits the storyline and each character's arcs"
"Mar 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is incredible! The whole family loved it! Another phenomenal movie from Dreamworks! 
"Mar 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Myself and younger daughter's enjoyed it
"Mar 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible film. I work at a cinema and this has been the best movie in two years. Still sends chills down my spine even after seeing the iconic scenes countless times.
"Mar 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Gato das botas 2 faz um bom trabalho ao equilibrar seu humor impressionante com uma história surpreendentemente sombria de como o espectro da morte pode limitar a capacidade de alguém de abraçar e aproveitar a vida completamente.
"Mar 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is excellent! "" It's just right! """
"Mar 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots is spectacular, touches on a very important theme."
"Mar 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly, it was the only movie in the theatre that I deemed age-appropriate for my kids. I wasn't expecting much, but ""oh my"" was I pleasantly surpised! This movie has heart, humor, charm, and has a genuinly good message to both parents and kids about enjoying what life has granted you, without cramming the message down your throat. It is devoid of ""woke"" media messages that are so prevalent in this day in age. This is one movie that will be added to my family collection. Already a classic in my book."
"Mar 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"DreamWorks is back! Animação linda, dublagem incrível (principalmente de Wagner Moura) os personagens, até mesmo os secundários tem um bom desenvolvimento, o assovio do Lobo arrepia até a alma (O Gato de Botas sabe do que eu estou falando) e uma mensagem muito bonita! Amei"
"Mar 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"What an exciting reprise to the last Pass and Boots movie. At was funny, full of action and great for adults as well as children."
"Mar 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Amusing and my granddaughter and her frien liked the movie
"Mar 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning movie and entertaining all the way through. I'm sure it would be a hit with any kid, and if you are willing to look past the simplistic plot and corny jokes, it can be an enjoyable experience for adult audiences as well."
"Mar 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The absolute best movie ever. Must see! Even though it might look like a kids movie, it is an amazing movie that you will enjoy no matter the age. The best description of a panic attack ever seen in a movie. The animation is remarkable, much like Spiderman Into The Spiderverse. The story is very creative and in my opinion, they made the scariest cartoon villain ever! All the characters are very entertaining to watch. All of the stories fit together so nicely. I can't wait to see what Dreamworks has in store for us if their movies are going to keep being the incredible!"
"Mar 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love this movie. It  is so good for any age group. The animation, score, dialogue, colour palettes and message is all beautiful. I love everything about it. Please watch this."
"Mar 17, 2023",POSITIVE,i watched it in class 10/10 Loved it
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"My 8-year-old daughter's review:

""I picked Puss in Boots because the pictures and the movie and the story is just beyond good, and I think you should watch Puss in Boots.  I think you'll like it or even love it."""
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Está Película Ya La Ví Con Mi Mamá Y Está Increible La Animación Te Hara Reír Y Reír Hasta Que Ya No Puedas Más.
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"A very funny, colorful and well animated movie. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish goes surprisingly deep into its main character giving a multi-layered personality and a very satisfying character development. The whole cast is particularly efficient to hook you up in their adventure, protagonists and antagonists all shine in their way and give you new favorites in the Shrek Universe. 
Things go fast here since the main goal is to entertain Puss in Boots don't take too much time in event that would usually ask for a little more development. It's notable but not necessarily a bad thing since the characters really help to smooth things with how they command the pacing.
The Last Wish is unexpectedly violent with literal deaths in it, a few drops of bloods, and one of the character is scary. Not a bad point actually, I found it pretty great that they dared to push a little the boundaries of family entertainment."
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"With a great script and a beautiful final message, Puss in Boots is one of the best animations in the studio and a great movie to watch as a family."
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a beautiful movie. It worked for and completely earns all of the praise it gets. 

It was visually fantastic. It was emotionally moving. They did a wonderful job telling the story. Even the parts I initially thought would be annoying were great. It was perfectly balanced and had such good messages throughout. 

This movie reminds you to appreciate life and what you have, to live in the moment, to make the most of the time you have, to not let fear control you but that it is ok to be afraid sometimes you just need to work to overcome it. It supports strong family connections, whether that family is biological or not. The antagonists/villains are superb.  It's really funny but still gives the emotional moments time to breath. And this is from a sequel movie to a spinoff about a swashbuckling cat. 

So many movies are the equivalent of junk food and we just keep accepting it and getting more of the same.

Movies like this need to be praised and supported. It's the only way to send a message that we are tired of the constant junk thrown at us.

Enormous thanks to everyone involved with the creation of this gem."
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie tops the original in every way and more, the animation takes a page out of spider man into the spider verse and it works, The characters are fun and entertaining, the messages can tackle adults and kids alike, 2 of the villains in this movie are top tier dreamworks, and the villain death is my favorite movie villain of all time, I have no negatives or nitpicks about this movie."

"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,fantastic fantastic fannnnntastic
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Gato de botas 2 é realmente um bom filme, mas o único problema é que os 30 a 40 minutos do filme faz parte do trailer ou seja no começo já sabemos o que vai acontecer"
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie both for kids and adults.  Great animation, story and action sequences."
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Una de las mejores secuelas que tiene Dreamworks fresca en su animación y excelente actuación de voces
"Mar 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,What am I missing here?  How is this a good movie? The production values are off the charts but . . . Juvenile and vulgar humor and one dimensional characters - no thanks.

"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is a visual spectacle, full of humor that if it makes you laugh, both the old and the new characters are too good, it is a perfect movie that makes you want to see it over and over again and you never get tired, 10/10."
"Mar 16, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was very funny. Kid appropriate. my granddaughter really loved it.
"Mar 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"WOW, Depois De ""Fracassos"" Como (Shrek Terceiro) e (Shrek Para sempre) A Franquia Mais Amada Voltou Com tudo Nesse Novo Filme Do Personagem Mais Icônico Da Franquia De Shrek (Gato De Botas), Trazendo Um Filme Com Personagens Ótimos, E Um Incrível Vilão, É de Arrepiar, Esse Filme É Perfeito."

"Mar 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"May not be as good as the original, but still pretty well done. Great watch."
"Mar 15, 2023",POSITIVE,PHENOMENAL! I LOVED IT!
"Mar 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie and it's positive message of the importance of seeing things in a positive light, like the character Perro, the little dog. Perro proves to everyone what an advantage it is to go through life seeing the good in everything and everyone. I also loved all the references to other Fairy Tales, and there's an excellent quote in the movie from The Wizard of Oz. It was very entertaining with plenty of action & adventure, and a little bit of a love story, too. I highly recommend the movie!"
"Mar 15, 2023",POSITIVE,We liked the puss or the lack of it
"Mar 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Uma das melhores animações que já vi, história simples porém bem pensada e bem executada, momentos épicos e de arrepiar."
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Wowww!!! Loved it!!!
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was too loud. I wished I had brought headphones for my grandson. The movie otherwise was entertaining. Hi
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this movie so much it was my favorite movie in 2022 but I Olso loved avatar the way of water.
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme espetacular. Animação bem feita, personagens cativantes e um vilão sensacional. O filme passa uma lição que muitas vezes ignoramos."
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best ""Shrekverse"" movie since Shrek 2."
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Peak. Simply Peak, amazing star villain and protagonists."
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was fine. The amount of commercials was RIDICULOUS!!
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"giga chad death, great soundtracks spectacular animations and graphics"
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,rizz in boots is a mastapiece
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wasn’t a huge fan of how many bleeped out cuss words there was, but the story line wasn’t to bad"
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent Sequel. 10/10
"Mar 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie has perhaps the best villains in animated movies, maybe ever. The animation is stunning, the humor hits well, the emotional moments work and seem earned. I thought Perrito was going to be an annoying side character but he quickly became incredibly lovable and added to the movie. The way Death is handled is marvelous, Puss' character development is good and isn't rushed, and no side plots are neglected or have too much screen time. Fabulous movie, i loved every moment."
"Mar 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fun story that had adults laughing. Great animation and transitions to other types of film styles. Enjoyed the way the story was told. Selma Hayek was off with her voice acting and it seemed like she didn’t see what she was voicing. 
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"With a hell of an opening punch, the movie is determined to deliver action alongside a surprising amount of heart as the film toys with the fear of death and legacy much more than most animated films. Packed with delightful voice talent, aided by the eternal chemistry between Hayak and Banderas."
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"yes, very very good :)"
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"A visual for the eyes. The characters were charming and fun, and the villains are just great. It could be scary for younger kids between the ages of 2-5. This is one of the best and my personal favorite animated movie and possibly even movie in general of 2022. If you haven't watched it yet and you have a Peacock subscription or your going the theater, choose this movie. One of the best Dreamworks movies ever made."
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,peak film at its finest
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of, if not the best animated movie Dreamworks has ever done."
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, The team behind the movie deserve all the happyness I can wish for them."
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was really impressed how much I liked this film in the end. And I am still listening the Deaths Theme Song.
The creators here did really the best with the archetypical villains and their heroes. It is a real fairy tale in its own right although it is born in a series of fairy tale parodies"
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is very good because when I see this movie I remind my friend yiğits butt and my friend Kuzey who is a therapy dog.
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"No explanation, just a Masterpiece. It has some funny moments and emotions. The villains are one of the best things in this movie as when death himself just got tired of seeing cats having nine lives and he had enough. I love how it describes that a boy didn't get as much attention as a boy. And he wants all of the magic in the world, so he can get attention and popularity. I would definitely rewatch this again with some friends and family. Overall this is a highly recommended movie that should be seen by everyone. One of the Greatest Dreamworks movies ever made."
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Best animated movie since Coco… 🙌🏼
"Mar 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,I thought nothing could outperform Shrek in terms of a complete lack of humor and overall cheesiness. I was wrong:)
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great movie. The Wolf, it was a great character, and the meaning of the story was so beatiful, i love this movie."
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Must-watch animation who loves cat!
"Mar 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,There were some very funny moments but not as good as Puss n Boots 2011
"Mar 13, 2023",POSITIVE,I really liked the movie. But some parts of the animation were just sloppy.
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Good funny story....definitely worth a watch.
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,THIS MOVIE WAS AMAZING!!!!!!!!! Such an awesome new take on visual effects and the Shrek Universe. THIS MOVIE WAS PERFECT
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Mostly for younger kids but very enjoyable
"Mar 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was such a cute movie but there was some language beeps that really shouldn't be in little kids movies.
"Mar 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not a good movie at all. No story, just not very well done. The kids will like it but if they are above 10 forget it. If you go get the matinee."
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"From the swashbuckling action the Shrek/Puss franchise is known for to the witty humor directed at young and matured viewers alike, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is massive breath of fresh air in both cinema and in the Dreamworks line of films that left me craving more, down to the mid credits scene."
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Good story line. I felt the animation could have been better.
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,The greatest animated sequel to the movie Puss and Boots and to Shrek too.
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing story with beautiful graphics and incredible characters.
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was so freaking good! I watched it with my sister because people wouldn't stop talking about it, and I was worried that it wouldn't live up to the hype… but boy was I wrong! Everything to the animation, to the story, to the characters, to the dialogue was absolutely PERFECT. I loved the Shrek cameo at the end too! Dreamworks deserves every bit of success that they are getting right now!😊👍"
"Mar 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very sad to report this movie, for the most part, bored me. Superior graphics and colors was not enough for me to rate this any higher. Cute cat though"
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"I created an account just to review this movie. I love the animation style, I love the story, and I love the little nods of nostalgia. Good movie for all ages."
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely loved this masterpiece!💜
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Damn good animated movie with heart and soul.  Filled with adventure and action. One of the greatest antagonist in a while.  GIGACHAD MOVIE OF THE YEAR
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"The animation and story are great the balancing between the ""antagonists"" was very well done."
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"With its visually stunning artstyle and captivating storyline, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a must-watch animated movie. That being said, I found the Twitter hype to be somewhat overrated. Nonetheless, it's definitely worth watching for its impressive animation and storyline."""
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots the last wish is a gorgeously animated, funny, intelligent, touching examination of the fear death, growing old and not being relevant anymore, while also exploring universal themes such as family, friendship, trust and the importance of treasuring every moment in life. Disney/Pixar can only dream about making a movie like this nowadays. Do yourself a favour and go watch this gem."
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fast moving.  Adults could enjoy it at an adult level, and the kids could enjoy it at a kid level."
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"My five year old daughter, and I really enjoyed it on our daddy-daughter datenight."
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss In Boots The Last Wish is Outstanding, AWESOME, and IMAGINATIVE. Truly A Perfect Masterpiece."
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best versions, funny and theoreticalogical!"
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,They did not need to go so hard.
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Cute movie to see with the grandkids.
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"The story line is outstanding, that you dont need a wish and to just be yourself and it will all work out"
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,So good! I loved the nostalgia of childhood fairytales and nursing rhymes throughout the movie. Im 28 and enjoyed it very much. 10/10!
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Get kids movie. As an adult its a feel good movie that will take you on ride back to when you read those nursery rhyme stories. Great movie to take your kids too.
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,My wife and I took 3 of our Grand Children to see this movie and they LOVED it!!
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"great action, great story, great heart!"
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought that puss and boots the last wish was a really good animated movie I've seen in a while. It was a fun, funny, cute movie."
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,A bloody masterpiece. Have seen it several times. If this does not win a Oscar I will riot.
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Personally this movie is completely underrated. I watched the first Puss In Boots movie and it was utter trash but this movie is amazing. Good plot and I liked the ideas of the ‘bad guys' being fairy tales. I did find the dog rather annoying though.
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,We brought our almost 9yr old son and his best friend and we all loved the movie!  Our son was laughing so much during the movie as well as mom and dad.  The visual graphics in the movie were top notch and the way they tied in childhood stories and characters into the movie plot was so cool!  It was a little scary for younger kids (2-5yr olds) as we heard some kids crying in the theater when the death character was coming to get Puss & Boots for his last life.  Over all it was one of the best kids movies and our son ranked it in his top 3 of all time.  My wife ranked it as one of her favoritesmaybe her best of all time.  I would agree and put it in my top three as well.  Because of the awesome graphics it is a movie that will be best seen in a large theater.
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"beg for mercy from puss! in boots!

the concept for this film is simple, puss has run out of his nine lives and can only get them back with the means of a wishing star which is in pretty high demand among the bad guys of the shrek cinematic universe. the competition is Goldilocks and the Three Bears and Little Jack Horner who is not so little anymore along with a certain someone who is behind puss for a very specific reason.

the execution of this concept is what makes this film such a treat. the screenplay is straightforward and fast-paced, drags somewhat in the second act but manages itself by the end. the music is perfect for the aesthetic (chef's kiss to be more accurate). the voice acting is muy buena (very good). Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Florence Pugh, Harvey Guillén, John Mulaney, Wagner Moura they're all just fantastic. I was genuinely invested in the characters and not solely on nostalgia. not that this film does a few callbacks but those aren't some cheap fan-services but something that add a little substance to the greater story.

now, the animation and the cinematography. ughhhh, it's so freaking beautiful !!! spiderverse swung in style so puss in boots could land perfecttly on it's feet. there is clearly inspiration for the animation here but instead of some cheap rip-off, it really feels like an artistic choice and comes off as an artist's fairytale come to life here. the movie literally starts with the words ""this is a fairytale..."" and lives up to it! the cinematography too is something to look out for. this film haz better shots than I can spot in a big budget Hollywood blockbuster these days. DreamWorks atleast never fails in that department and always manages to exceed expectations!

to be honest, I wasn't really expecting anything from this film because the shrek cinematic universe has been near-dead for so long, but this film gives me hope. this film gives me something to put my faith in. you'd think that years of development hell would usually mean bad for a film but not for PUSS!... IN BOOTS!

just go and have a good time with this. and if you haven't yet seen the trailer for the film, don't do it. just go into the film blindly like I did. It will surely give you a few surprises! in my opinion, this is the best film in the Shrek Cinematic Universe since Shrek 2, which isn't saying a lot, but it should since Shrek: Forever After was the only good film after Shrek 2.

P.S.: the new DreamWorks intro is so good. I just love it!"
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the movie a lot
"Mar 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good storyline, crikey"
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"In a time when many movies are bland retellings of old stories or a jumbled mess of little creative vision mixed with corporate algorithms, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, is a breath of fresh air. The visual style is stunning, with plenty of creative flare and eye-popping colors. The beautiful animation is accompanied by timeless and heartwarming messages that anyone can connect to. All I can say is we need more movies like this!"
"Mar 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"These is pretty much the spider verse of DreamWorks the only thing that I ""dislike"" is the piss joke like I get it, It's kids movie but like WHY
besides that movie good 👍"
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'd never seen the previous Puss in Boots movie, but as a grandad bringing his 9 year old grandson to the theater I personally found this to be a funny movie and was probably laughing a little more than my grandson.  Some of  the subtle cliches may have gone over his head, but I found them funny."
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Even better than the movie from 2011! I love them both! I like they continued Puss and Kitty thread and even they added awesome backstory!
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,The greatest animation I've ever watched.
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Animation style, pacing and funny characters."
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was super cute and great for kids!!! I really enjoyed it.
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is pure fun. Good pace. Good characters. A history with a message. This is a work of love, not (just) corporate greed. Enjoy y Olé!"
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is truly one of the best animated films I’ve ever seen, I’d recommend this to all age groups."
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"it was such a nice movie, I really liked it, was funny, epic and just nostalgic even, I reccommend this to everyone"
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Something for everyone.  Adult jokes keep the older humans entertained and light-hearted goofy jokes keep the children entertained.  Good message and a great family bonding movie to discuss.  Overall, funny, entertaining and a good time."
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a truly amazing movie, by FAR the scariest villain I've seen in a while. When he come on screen and the whistling just gave me chills it was perfect, its was like i were being hunted by the one and only death like i can feel the fear he carries. Great project for a kids movie, it add a lot of story to puss like the way he revealed his true colors at the end of the movie and the friendships he have along with the adventures he have, showing that puss is a huge character in the Shrek universe even one of the strongest he last against death in a battle. I really like how they end the movie, SPOILERS they way death gave him a chance at life because he showed who he really is and hes not that overconfident guy who think he can work alone, he shows that he have heart. Death was no longer searching for that same guy anymore he saw his true self i love that, instead of just making it where they made death surrender or die OR show that hes weak. The moral of the story and the text make a lot of sense and was inspiring truly an experience.

The villain in this movie is really scary and the whistling sound that he make gave me chills. I could feel the fear that he carry, like I was being hunted by Death himself. This movie is a great project for kids because it add a lot of story to Puss in Boots' character. We see him reveal his true colors at the end of the movie, and the friendships he have along with the adventures he go on. This show that Puss is a huge character in the Shrek universe and even one of the strongest because he last against Death in a battle.

I really like how the movie end. SPOILERS Death gave Puss a chance at life because he showed who he really is and he's not just an overconfident guy who think he can work alone. He show that he have heart. Death was no longer searching for that same guy anymore because he saw Puss's true self. I love that the movie didn't just make Death surrender or die, or show that he's weak. The moral of the story and the text make a lot of sense and was truly inspiring. The movie is a great reminder that it's important to show our true selves and that we can all change for the better.

In conclusion, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a great movie that you should definitely watch. The story is engaging, the characters are interesting, and the villain is truly scary. The movie add a lot of depth to Puss in Boots' character, showing that he's a strong and complex character in the Shrek universe. The movie's ending is satisfying and inspiring, reminding us of the importance of being true to ourselves. If you're a fan of Shrek or just looking for a great family movie, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is definitely worth a watch."
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Way better than all the horrible, disgusting and blasphemous movies that come out these days. The villain is the greatest part of the movie."
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"When I say I am a simple person, I'm not lying... I really am easy to please with animated movies. However, I must give it to DreamWorks, this sequel really caught me off guard! I was afraid that it would be a cringy empty headed movie!
The visuals are FANTASTIC! The animation? SPECTACULAR! Score? Catchy as hell. Voice Acting? Music to the ears! The casting for La Muerte was really a great choice! I loved the writing and the new characters that we were introduced to. Keep up the good work!
-10/10. Would (and will) watch again-"
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,It was great from art style to tied in reverses
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was great!! Funny, sweet it was awesome!"
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good movie loved watching it had a great storyline and interesting characters along with the way the animation illuminated the screen.
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"You might be bothered by the slow fps scenes but other than that there is not a single flaw in this animated masterpiece. Voice actors, animations, art, story, 10/10."
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,That's how you make a timeless movie. Thought Hollywood had forgotten.
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the absolute best animated movie ever realised. The depiction of human emotions, and the feeling of fear and dread that Puss feel thourough the movie is geniunely among the best portrayed feelings in animation history. The plot is also incredibly fun to watch, and the personification of Death is probably one of the, if not the best character I've seen in a movie. I just love it."
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing film, new favourite movie."
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Melhor filme de 2022 disparado
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,This should win an oscar.
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"simplesmente, foi uma grande revelação pois eu não esperava muita coisa desde o trailer, mas cara eu to maravilhado, roteiro, atuação animação, tudo nota 10, e se pá deve ganhar o oscar de melhor filme de animação de 2022, pois isso realmente é bem merecido para um grande filme como este"
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"História redonda, simples porém funcional, ótimo filme para a família"
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Bro this movie is actually so good. Watch it fr
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was just tons of fun, every character was interesting and even when the story went to focus on a different character, I wasn't wishing I was still with that character. You can tell very easily all the passion that went into this movie and the art style, my god, it is phenomenal the way it perfectly captures the painting like aesthetic is flawless, more only gripe with this film is the cat retirement home scenes, I felt like it went on for a bit too long, but other than that it was perfect, I totally recommend checking this movie out"
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,One of if not the best animation I have ever seen.
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"After ""Rise of The Guardians (2012)"" DreamWorks movies have been so dumb and cringe. They were barely managing to make an watchable movie.
Even though the first Puss in Boots was pretty good, I was literally expecting nothing of this movie. The trailer for Puss in Boots 2 show a silly plot that makes the movie seem just another bad DreamWorks movie, like it's been in the past ten years.
However i was very surprised that this movie was ACTUALLY good. The story, though it does have some silly moments and classic dumb DreamWorks humor, it's still pretty good and enjoyable. The protagonist motivations are solid and you can feel his growth through the movie. The style, though it seems poorly at first, is actually really beautiful and artistic.
I just hope the next DreamWorks movies were as good as this one.
But of course, after seeing the trailer for ""Ruby Gillman"" and ""Trolls 3"", my hopes flushed down the toilet."
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Love this film. Loved the first one too. Loved all the characters and plot line. Cant wait for it to come out on DVD so I can watch it over and over again
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"I LOVEE this movie. I love the character development, the animation style, the plot, the anxiety representation, and I especially love the death villain. He is so eerie and it makes me really get into the film. Over all, five stars 😎😼"
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is an incredible follow-up to Puss's story. Lovely story and character growth, and the animation is beautiful."
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went to see this because my friend said she saw a teenager on tiktok say it ""low key slaps"", and after my experience with this movie, I concur. I may even say it high-key slaps. I loved the colorful and inventive sets, especially once they enter the dark woods and the map changes their obstacles - an excellent story device and visually delightful. We all loved it when the cats ‘broke character' and acted like cats. I also became incredibly invested in the Goldilocks/Bears Family Drama. 10/10!"
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"What's not to like? You've seen all the other reviews I'm sure. The only people that don't like it are the folks that don't respect animation in general and some distraught parents that think a single drop of blood is unacceptable. This movie is as close to a masterpiece as a family film can be, tackling subjects like mortality and found family. Guaranteed you'll like it."
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Great family movie. Definitely take your kids or nephews out nieces to see it. Really enjoyed the story and the movie delivered.
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,so fun and entertaining!
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was great!
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,amazing movie with so much depth and lessons to be learned
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the underlying message about inner dialogue, conscious, fear, anxiety, and dealing with your inner critic was so relatable. There were jokes for parents, jokes for kids, the style of the animation for fight scenes was very unique. Kids loved it, we loved it. 5 stars!"
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great animation, acting, and story. Excellent film all around!"
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was such a surprise. Puss in Boots The Last Wish is amazing in terms of story and animation. Movie of the year worthy. 
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Witty and fun to watch… love the cross references with other fairy tales
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"such a good movie, real story, funny, MUCH better than pixar and disney movies"
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Easily one of the most complete animated films released in years, heavy talent all throughout the voice acting cast tied with a fresh new style of animation. Not to mention an impeccable script covering universal and mature themes. Absolutely incredible."
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing animation and style. The whole concept of the movie is interesting and can be enjoyed by any age. Lots of funny jokes and a perfect villain for this film with some intense scenes
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie all around and a great plot twist just another awesome movie for all to enjoy 😁
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Fabulous visit to the cinema with the kids - wasn't expecting much but this was a great adventure with a nice message.
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"From the tone of the movie, to the actors casted, this is hands down, Dreamworks' best movie since Kung Fu Panda 3 and How to Train Your Dragon 3. I will even say that this is even better than every Disney film released in the past 2 years. Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, and Harvey Guillen's performance as Puss in Boots, Kitty Softpaw, and Perrito are just fantastic. John Mulaney as Big Jack Horner is a delight, the Wolf is awesome and Goldilocks and the 3 bears were all hilarious to watch. Dreamworks has done it again!"
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Stunning animation, voice acting and the action scenes are very well done. This movie isn't just for kids either. Brilliant."
"Mar 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,Exactly what you'd expect from a puss in boots film. Easy to watch but nothing special. The ending was a nice touch.
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots delivers one good story ,plot, best villain and friendship. it gives me hope that there are good writers out there."
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Yeah, this movie is pretty much as close to perfect as you can get. Every frame is so beautiful I want to hang it up on my wall, the action goes unbelievably hard with insane coreography, and it has a sweet story on top of it all. In addition, Antonio Banderas gives his performance his all, and its a welcome return to classic one-dimensional villains. Abs-a-bally-loutely amazing, 10/10."
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Brilliant writing makes this a movie for both kids and adults. Some really serious life issues are covered here. And the fight scenes are AWESOME!!!!!!!!
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Thoughtful, beautifully written, gorgeous animation, funny and endearing. Amazing voice acting, honestly one of the best movies on a long time. Sigh wish there were more like this. Well done Dream Works!"
"Mar 7, 2023",POSITIVE,The animation is incredible and the villains are amazing.
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Creative, action-packed and a lot of fun, this film packs a deep message and is a must-watch for kids and adults alike"
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Que filmaço! Uma animação que surpreendeu demais! Eu não gostei muito do primeiro, mas esse já é um dos meu favoritos! Além deles fazerem o lobo ser ""a morte"" e darem uma lição forte e fazer um espetáculo, que te faz ter medo dele, o perrito, é muito engraçado, que no trailer vc acha que vai ser aquele sidekick irritante, mas é o contrário!"
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,This is straight up a amazing perfect movie to watch amazing characters good story amazing animation it keeps me entertained from start to finish so many iconic and Badass scenes I loved it so much can't wait for it to be on Netflix hopefully
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Better thought through plot and more character development than the last six Marvel films put together. Beautiful to look at too with an individual style which is a mix of painted illustration mixed with manga.  This is also refreshing as most animated films all seem to look the same.
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"great storytelling! reminds me of something from before 2015! Timeless themes and no exhausted progressive political messaging. well done to both writers for not caving in to ideologies and just focusing on a good story. Hopefully, more to come. 
I'm gonna watch it again,I loved it. very refreshing."
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Outstanding! Everything about this movie is phenomable.
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"puss in boots: the last wish is the greatest movie of all time. It saved my firstborn, cured my illnesses, cured my depression, stopped climate change, saved animation as a medium, killed Donald trump, and solved world hunger. In conclusion, the wolf should step on me."
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's great, one of the better movies lately. The characters are great and relatable in various ways, not as flat as expected from animated movie. Love that studio started experimenting with animation styles, and it's not just another standartised 3D jig (looking at you Pixar and your recent years of work that's becoming increasingly muddied stylistically). 
I'm not sure whether Puss in Boots is going to have another story, but I'm pleasantly surprised about where Dreamworks could go after seeing Puss in Boots."
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Time to wake up, Disney. Dreamworks has long been eating your lunch, and Puss just finished your dessert. I cannot praise this movie enough. It's a visual feast, hilarious in places and sombre and honest where it counts (and they let the hard-hitting moments linger, none of this wisecracking a joke right away that the MCU does just in case the audience stops laughing for 3 seconds).

The Last Wish is a breath of fresh air. It doesn't harp on at the audience; it doesn't lecture, and it doesn't reiterate the typical ""environment good, white men bad"" rhetoric that Disney has been repeating since they turned awful. Puss carries a genuinely essential and universal message about making the most of your life, overcoming hardships and bad luck and coming out all the stronger for it with an appreciation for what you have. It may be hard for modern audiences to relate to putting others' needs before your own instant selfish gratification, but it's nice that that's also a theme.

It's fantastic, and I would love to see more studios returning to a more wholesome and honest approach to making movies. Enough woke BS"
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Wonderful storytelling and the pacing was all right. This continues the amazing Shrek quality of humor and weaving of childhood tales' ideas. It's a must see for anyone who's ever enjoyed any Shrek movies. I look forward to more!
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,me and my gf loved it!!!
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Push in boots has gain more fans with this late episode ''the last wish''.
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Puss and boots charactor
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Must see with family, or even just with friends!"
"Mar 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Brilliant for both little & big kids, me being the latter..."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I honestly wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as I did. It felt fresher in animation style,   a villain that felt genuinely a little scary and probably the most relatable version of Puss in Boots."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is EPIC and yes I admit that I'm terrified of the wolf he's terrifying he's cool but terrifying
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,filme 10/10 tudo de bom
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I absolutely loved that movie
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie made me call my dad I never met that’s how good the film was, the shrek universe makes the impossible possible. Definitely recommend watching this & giving your dad a call."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie made me call my dad I never met, the shrek universe makes the impossible possible. Must watch this film."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie from beginning to end
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,It was entertaining.
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I watched the movie for the first time a little under two months ago and can I just say, I was in awe. I was in Florida, visiting my grandparents for vacation and it was one of the first things I wanted to do with my grandma while there. I had heard a lot of praise for the movie from my friends (age range 14-20) and since I'm an enjoyer of animation in the first place, I went to go see it. Now, I will say I went into this with little background of how the first movie went - I had watched it once, and that was several years prior. Good thing about The Last Wish, though - you don't need too much background information, so to an extent it can work as a standalone movie if you really want it to be. Going into the actual movie, WOW! The animation was absolutely stunning. They definitely took a lot of inspiration from Into The Spiderverse regarding the animation, mixing the 2D and 3D together. I've seen several reviews saying that made it ""hard to watch"" or ""look cheap"", but it was quite the opposite, quite dynamic! It was also very colorful and very detailed, but not too much so - ""just right"", as Goldilocks would say. Speaking of Goldilocks: regarding the characters, I think they were also very well done. It's easy to root for Puss, he's not one of those protagonists that you get bored and annoyed with, especially with Kitty and Perrito supporting him in his leading role. The villains of the movie were also very well done: Death (the wolf) was quite ominous and accurately embodied Death, ""straight up"". Goldilocks was a flawed character rather than an actual evil one, and it was nice that her story and wish was resolved at the end in a sweet way, though I will say if I have any critiques at all you could see that from a mile away. Jack Horner, though being the most unapologetically evil character, is also one of the funniest and most memorable of all. Killer design, funny lines, John Mulaney did such a great job voicing him. In fact, all of the voice actors and actresses were flawless - they fit their characters and fit the tones perfectly. 
A lot of reviews against this movie say it's too dark, but I think that's what makes this movie so beautiful. Yes, one of the main topics is mortality, and if that's not something you are ready to talk about with your child - assuming that's who you're going to bring to the movie - then do not bring them. However, if you want them to be able to discuss and see the topic of mortality in a healthy, safe way, this is definitely the movie for you. A lot of media these days struggles in how to discuss death. I think The Last Wish definitely illustrates how ominous and scary the topic of death may be, with its personification of death (the wolf character). At the same time, Puss is able to tackle his fear of death in the end. 
All things considered, this movie absolutely knocked it out of the park. There is so much to enjoy out of this movie, from humor, fun characters, sweet moments, dynamic fight scenes (which do NOT take up the whole movie, by the way!), absolutely GORGEOUS animation, and a killer soundtrack that doesn't get enough credit...and of course, the fact that there is a lot to think about after watching it. 
I highly recommend this movie. Treat yourself and/or your loved ones and go watch it."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Terrific story and finally a movie with a positive message about family and perpective in life
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely a good watch with the family.  My whole group enjoyed it and have watched it multiple times now.
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Cleverly inventive, delightfully humorous and heartwarming, ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"", much like the ""Shrek"" films, has plenty for young and old to relish while delivering some astounding action sequences and lovable characters and spoofs on classic fairy tales and nursery rhymes."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining even for adults.  Enjoyed it with my older teens.
"Mar 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Unfunny. Animation is colorful but cheap, poor detail and depth"
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,An absolutely great movie the villains were perfect and the animation was phenomenal the best animated movie in years I recommend 10/10!
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought this movie was the best and I love the reveal of the next Shrek movie. My personal or should I say purr-sonal favorite character was purrito. The villain or villains more like are fresh and new, the animation is great and I have watched it 3-4 times now. If you are a parent on the edge of watching it with your children I suggest giving it a watch. I love this movie so much that as you can see I basically wrote an essay on it. Watch at all costs as it is a must watch 10/10 -Anonymous"
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great animation, stellar cast, menacing villain, and a great character arc for the main character."
"Mar 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Nice movie for kids.
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Lots of adventures for Puss. Animation was unreal!
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,The animation is outstanding and is on par with that of 'Spider-man Into the Spider-verse'. Puss in Boots is a very compelling protagonist who goes through a very well written character arc where he comes to term with his mortality. The side characters are very entertaining and give the audience some strong emotional scenes as well as lots of laughs. Death's character design was beautiful and he is one of the coolest animated villains ever. Jack Horner was hilarious! The way he disregards human life and is irredeemably evil is so refreshing and something I haven't seen a lot of since old Disney. DreamWorks really put their heart and soul into this film and made it one of the best animated movies in recent memory. Would recommend and is definitely worth your time. Go see it if you haven't already.
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked that the story heartened back to the original fairy tales as did Shrek.  It was sweet
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Very cute.  Kids loved it and not boring for the parents!
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is so good. From the gorgeous animation style to the compelling, and sometimes touching, story, this is quite possibly one of my favorite DreamWorks movies, right up there with The Bad Guys!"
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a great movie for all family
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Kids enjoyed the movie
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was ok. My kids loved it though, and we went for them."
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is by far one of the few modern gems to come out in recent years.  The story is fantastic, it's funny, heartwarming, and exciting all rolled up into one ball of yarn.  Great for the kids, great for the adults, just an all around must see for all."
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Golly, I wanna watch this over and over! PUT YOUR MONEY INTO THIS, WE NEED MORE MOVIES LIKE THIS! THE COMEDY WAS JUST LIKE THE FIRST SHREK MOVIE(pefect), THE CONFLICT WAS MY FAVORITE OUT OF ANY SHREK UNIVERSE MOVIE, VILLAINS WERE JUST AS, IF NOT BETTER THAN THE KUNG FU PANDA ONES(mainly Death), THE SIDE CHARACTERS LIKE THE *ETHICAL BUG* WERE GREAT. I MISS THIS PROFANITY, I MISS PUSS, I MISS THESE REFERENCES TO FAIRY TALES, AND THE TEASER [SPOILER]

AT THE END WHERE THEY RETURN TO FAR, FAR AWAY WAS MAKING ME WANNA SCREAM IN HAPPINESS. I JUST CAN'T WAIT FOR THE FUTURE OF DREAMWORKS. Though   I like Shrek just a little bit more, this the overall better movie. 10/10 Watch it now!"
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was really awesome the was how they made death scary my expectations were way higher then I thought
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well balanced storytelling with great characters and a good message. Catch up Disney, focus on making a good story and money will follow, not the other way around."
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"My expectations weren't set very high buy when my kids dragged me to the theater I was pleasantly surprised. It's greatest feature is it's beautiful Art Style. The deviation from the classic DreamWorks look really, really works here. Great tie ins from previous franchise titles, funny, and enjoyable for the entire family no matter the age."
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Best villains of all time!
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Modern Disney should learn from this how to make a good and fun animated movie
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie with great characters and great plot
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots 2 is the greatest movie of 2022. The first time an animated villain gave me actual chills when he appeared. The animation was stellar and overall, just amazing."
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a great movie. Death scared the shit outta me.
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought the movie was really cute. I would definitely recommend going to go see it. Im an adult and I went to see it but I loved it. Im definitely planning to go back
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie had no right to be as good as it was. First I want to start by talking about the villain. Holy shit that was awesome to see the menacing figure that you could believe would actually make the fearless Puss in Boots quiver. The animation worked well in the kind of Spider-Man into the Spiderverse type of way where the frames drop and it looks great here as well. I thought the movie was pretty imaginative and the side characters were likable. The morals while not super deep, were well done and properly conveyed. This movie shows that Dreamworks can still release bangers."
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic all around. Villains especially were top-tier, and tons of humor that adults could enjoy while the kid stuff wasn't cringe."
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Um pouco infantil, porém muito bom pra distrair."
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"muito bom melhor filme que ja vi na vida, eu fiz ate uma conta so para me dar minha opinião e avaliação"
"Mar 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"A film made with care, with people who knew and wanted to make it, they enjoyed making it, they liked the jokes, they liked everything... making every detail with great care, congratulations, one of the best films I've ever seen!"
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Its Nice! Wont forget the details and the amazing story of this ! Its pretty short since im not english lol
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"That was the cutest new film I've seen so far, that was literally so wholesome and perfect. The way they portrayed Puss's anxiety was portrayed well. And Perrito!"
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"During the start I was like ""ya this is good, then I was like ""ok, okkk this is really good"" then outa no where I was like ""BY JESUSES HOLY SANDALS THIS IS GOOOOOD"". They need to contact Marvel and say hey guys this is how you do a good film considering they have been lacking lately (just saying)"
"Mar 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Nesta continuação da origem do personagem apresentado em Shrek 2, o Gato de Botas se vê em uma situação desesperadora ao perceber que só lhe resta mais uma vida. Então, determinado a mudar o seu destino, ele parte em busca da Estrela dos Desejos para recuperar as suas vidas perdidas. Nesse contexto, a obra vai surpreender ao apresentar uma série de inovações visuais que mescla elementos em 2D e 3D, proporcionando movimentos dinâmicos e fluidos semelhantes aos vistos em ""Homem-Aranha no Aranhaverso"". Além disso, a aventura é também muito bem construída e conta com todos os elementos esperados, incluindo ação, emoção e alívio cômico. 

Desse modo, embora a história em si seja um tanto clichê e previsível, todos os personagens são muito bem aproveitados, o que garante uma experiência divertida e envolvente. Além do mais, toda a trama principal e as subtramas dos demais personagens também são bem construídas e exploram temas relevantes como o sentido da vida, traumas, autoconhecimento, diversidade familiar e amizade. Portanto, é interessante observar a presença deles, assim como o antagonista, são fundamentais para enredo ficar completo e equilibrado.

Para tanto, ainda que a trama não apresentar grandes reviravoltas ou surpresas, com uma narrativa previsível e fórmulas conhecidas de outras animações, o filme é capaz de encantar o público com a sua atmosfera única, referências e personagens carismáticos. Portanto, independentemente de a obra ter inspirações em outras animações, ela surpreende com sua execução e inovações pontuais, onde consegue cumprir com excelência o que promete, ao emocionar, arrancar risadas e criar empolgação para futuras continuações."
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great. I go as far as to say, best animated movie ever (though that may change).The animation style is very good. The paintbrush style mixed with the framerates dropping when there is action makes it a very good movie. The general story is also great. It follows a character who is dealing with the fear of ""Death"", both figuratively and literally. So please watch this movie, it is so good."
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Gorgeous animation with a fun story, obviously the humor is a bit childish but it's a puss and boots movie lmao."
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Can you give me Shrek 5 please
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the greatest dream works films of all time, fabulous colors, characters, and story."
"Mar 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Some virtuous themes but with the amount of references to ""murder"", ""kill"", and death...not sure who this movie is for, definitely not the small children that were in the theater."
"Mar 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"A beautiful movie about pride, humility, anxiety, and contentment."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was outstanding , it had great character moments and the animation was on point in a lot of scenes in the movie. This movie is rewatchable."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I'll destroy every last bell wielder.
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,de longe até o momento o melhor filme do ano
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Buena pelicula muy divertida incluyendo trajo unos nuevos personajes que son muy buenos como perrito o jack horner etc ojala la disfruten como yo a los que todavia no la ha visto
"Mar 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,Had been looking forward to this but after 50 minutes we felt compelled to leave. It was terrible.
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a piece of art, from the plot from to the animation! The animation of the wolf was really well made and had some deep meanings of life. Also with the character of the dog, comic and cute feelings were all around the cinema. Greta movie! Totally recommend it 👍"
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,A cute addition to the Puss story.
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is literally PERFECT. The animation, the writing, the comedy, everything is just amazing."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie! On the level of Shrek One
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a amazing movie it was hilarious as well as had awesome animation
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is my favourite movie ever now, I watch this time flies so fast.
I love the characters, the music, the animation style is absolutely perfect, I just adore this movie and I recommend it for sure"
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Someone: nooo you can't like puss in boots! It's a children's movie!

Me: haha sassy orange cat with sword go BRRR"
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie for kids and adults.
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I brought my boys for their 16th birthday and they thought it was a fun and enjoyable movie.  The liked how the fairy tales were incorporated. They said the cinemaphotography was epic.  They were highly entertained and reiterated parts of the movie the next day.
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Una excelente trabajo de animación
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is THE movie of the year! Not only is it a visually stunning movie, but it is a masterfully told story. It is heavily stylized, reminiscent of  storybook illustrations, and comic-book action scenes. The story is incredibly focused and well-told, with strong charaterization for all of the characters. There isn't a single unlikeable character. The consistency in tone and plot theme definitely makes this a winner! Highly recommend, and definitely worth revisiting again and again. 5/5 -- will watch again!"
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,10/10 greatest movie so far
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Very well made and amazing movie
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the villain wolf very cool bad guy
 to come after puss in boots."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Good for the kids and adults. I love the details in this movie.
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,The best movie shown that proves that Dreamworks is gaining the upper hand with movie making against Disney. Amazing villains and characters along with scenes to make you cry.
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Animation very vivid and exciting to watch with action sequences. Awesome storyline.
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Normally can't stand cartoon movies, but I enjoyed this one."
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it.  It was great. Clever and not overly obnoxious.
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"such a good, heart tugging movie"
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,genius. pure genius.
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"A sequel to an average spin-off film that struggles to make its own name somehow has a sequel more than a decade later that excels at everything cinema is missing these days. Great storytelling, great villains, excellent character journeys and a kid's film that has more profound and more mature themes that even 12A and 15 films lack. While I admit the Wolf may be slightly too scary for the age range it appeals to in its more vibrant child-like audience, I think it fits into a wider family film that has its laughs for the kids while not being afraid to make an emotional effect on the grown-ups. Kids and grown-ups love this film alike, just what a FAMILY film should do. Family films are now more kid's films that grown-ups watch out of necessity, but Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is hopefully the start of animation going back to being a family occasion and not just a kids-only appeal. Dreamworks could be onto the renaissance of animation, and if the same team is working on Shrek 5, I am definitely on board."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing! I really really really enjoyed it! Great animation/art style, story, characters, side characters, soundtrack, cast, villains, relationships u name it. Everything about it was so good, def one of my fave movies. A must watch for ppl who love dreamworks and adventure. Watching it on the big screen was amazing and I highly recommend watching it cause u won't be disappointed"
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, it's crazy because I really wasn't expecting a spinoff movie to be this good, let alone a sequel to a spinoff."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"one of the best movies I've seen in years, an impeccable plot"
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was so great, absolutely in perfection. We did not expect Puss in Boots and this hit us so hard. We love the animation, the graphics, especially the Villain of the show. I am just so speechless."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,fire movie 10/10at this movie man greatest movie I watched it was so awesome and it was great
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"IT WAS SO CUTE . I have a huge Anxiety About death and have panick attacks most nights out of fear, thiss movie made that fear lessen . Learning that its okay to be scared and that what matters is you live a good life with love ♥"
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved this movie!!! Dreamworks killed it. Loved the action and how wholesome the ending was 
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the first time where I have seen the audience scores aligned with the critic scores. Normally, I would say critic scores are trying to be cooperate-friendly and be as nice as possible to the movie(the exact opposite of what a critic is ironically), but I have to say, the critic and audience score is very justified. I may or may not update this post, because I have only seen this movie once.

So right now, I am going to be upfront, and write my critiques out of the way so I can talk about the good stuff after.

So, I don't know if it's the effects of my sensory issues and loud movie theater speakers clashing, but it induced a bit of anxiety in me. It could've just be the first few minutes kind of rushing through along with other effects, or it was just loud speakers and my sensitive ears colliding. I really don't know, I would have to rewatch so other time to see. The first few minutes are kind of just a fuzzy memory to me.

I also don't know why they didn't just address the problem between Puss and Soft-paws earlier in the movie. There isn't necessarily anything bad about it, but I feel it would've been better addressed earlier.

That's really my only concerns, not even a problem really.

I think that all the villians are all pretty solid for there being multiple villains. You know what. Scratch that. They aren't just solid villains. They are all really good villains. Plain an simple. 

Jack Horner isn't trying to be relatable at all. He doesn't have some sad back story that tries to get you to sympathize with him. He is just pure evil. He believes only he should be entitled to his power, doesn't give a damn about anyone else, and would do anything to get what he want, even if it means needlessly putting others lives at risk, even those who dedicate there services to him. It is a bit more refreshing to see that we aren't being guilt tripped through a story, and we are being shown that evil isn't made because of bad things. It can just be made in anyone, regardless. Plain and simple. 

He also isn't 2 dimensional either. He might not have a conscious telling him what right and wrong is, but you are shown he has a reason for doing it, even if you don't understand his ideologies or reasonings. It is showcased in ways that you understand what he is doing and why. He knows that once he gets his hands on the power, no one will be able to stop him anyway, and he is confident he can get it.

Ohhh… and death. Death is just amazing to watch on screen. He literally gave me the chills anytime he was on screen, and I love it. That's how you right a villain. When his presence on screen is so intense, that you get chills just seeing him. He is just a badass. Through and through. Nothing else. And I don't mean it metaphorically or rhetorically or poetically or theoretically or any other fancy way. He is a total badass. Straight. Up.

He has so many memorable quotes, I just can't help but reference them as I am writing this review! He is genuinely that fun and memorable as a villain!!! 

He also has a motive that isn't just clear like Jack Horners, but you understand why. And you don't just understand why, his motives are almost justified. You almost root for him at times.

Not to mention Puss in Boots arc where he goes from arrogant ass who doesn't truly value his lives until he realizes he doesn't have any to lose, to one who would like to spend his life wisely and happily, realizing what life is.

Everyone going after the wish has a reason to go after the wish, and then they realize they had what they wished for, and it's just so good. It shows that you could learn to look at what you have and not take it for granted.

I could go on for hours and hours why this movie was such a good movie. But I bet you probably came here for a shorter review just to see if this movie. You didn't come for a whole essay. So I am going to cut it short here and save everyone including myself time. This movie is going to be one of the highest ratings I may ever give to a movie. It's that good. Watch it as soon as possible."
"Feb 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"The new sequel to the puss in boots franchise is definitely one one of the best Dreamworks movie that I have seen since Kung Fu Panda 3. The animation was a fresh look over what Dreamworks typically does. The characters were relatable while keeping themselves unique towards the movie. The movie is certainly a must see kind of movie, suitable for all ages."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"DreamWorks is clearly saying with this movie that they are now king of the hill in animation films. The animation is incredible and the cast of characters is great. The one thing that sticks out though is the character Death. In my opinion one of the scariest villains in animation history, he defies in any scene giving you goosebumps along with an incredibly intimidating voice given by the talented Wagner Moura. If this is the new standard of what DreamWorks is going to make, I can confidentially say for everyone, we are excited and hope for the best. But please no more Trolls or Boss Baby."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"hace tiempo que no disfrutaba una película familiar, esta es una de las pocas películas que puedes disfrutar en estos años, la película es impresionante y su calidad es brutal, la historia es muy buena y suficiente para dejarte enganchado en cada escena de la película, su ambientación es espectacular como para apreciar cada detalle de la película, no diría que es una película para un niño menos de 10 años ya sea por algunas escenas sensibles. para mi esta es una muy buena película que te deja atrapado hasta que termina, muy recomendada para verla en familia y sobre todo es disfrutable."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"The animated film is fantastic in every way. And I don't mean it metaphorically or rhetorically, Or poetically or theoretically, or in any other fancy way. Straight up, great movie."
"Feb 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"PG?!? I was absolutely shocked at the fat shaming, ""what the hell"" usage, name calling, extremely rude gestures and bullying from the ""baker"", this movie is NOT appropriate for anyone under the age of 12. My 6 year old was absolutely terrified of the ""wolf of death,"" which I'm also blown away that we are trying to covey such emotional traumatizing messages to children. The movie is pretty enjoyable for an adult, hardly even close to appropriate for a child. I hope they can re-rate it PG13"
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,The perfect movieforeverrrrr
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,one of the best movies ever
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best movie I have seen this year better than the blue cat people movie. highly recommended
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Todo en esta pelicula es espectacular, la presentacion de los distintos personajes, la aparicion de ""el lobo"" demuestra que con amor al proyecto todo sale fabuloso, la historia a pesar de ser un poco predecible en ocasiones no se hace tediosa gracias a la innovacion en la animacion, un punto extra es que la carga de comedia no es excesiva y, al menos para mi, las ideas o ""moralejas"" que pretende plasmar son ideales para cualquier momento de la vida, tanto chicos como grandes pueden disfrutar de esta cinta y salir con un buen sabor de boca"
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,The only problem with this movie is we don't have enough Jack Horner.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked the dog. It was hilarious
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Dreamworks stepped up! Creating a new story with the same old Puss we know and love.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Uma animação repleta de belas mensagens de superação, confiança, amor e valorização da vida.
Bem executado e bem dirigido, com um elenco de peso em sua dublagem, e um belo destaque para Wagner Moura e as emoções que ele consegue causar com seu papel no filme, genial.
O filme me fez rir e chorar quase que ao mesmo tempo, uma obra de arte."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme divertido, engraçado e tem uma animação perfeita"
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme abrange não só a plateia infantil mas adulta também, como esperado. Com certeza e uns dos melhores filmes que assisti esse ano."
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,My grandkids and I enjoyed the movie very much
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Was way better than I thought it was going to be.  My boys were laughing and ohhing the whole time.
"Feb 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic film for the whole family.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a very good movie my take from the movie was to appreciate the things you have now and love the life you live…
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I walked into this movie with very little expectations and walked out absolutely blown away. The story was amazing and every character was done perfectly. I would highly recommend this movie for all ages; it is a perfect movie for families.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"NAH THIS MOVIE IS GREAT, I HAVE NOT SEEN SUCH A GREAT MOVIE IN YEARS. They took a lot of things seriously and not played everything as a joke and showed many messages in just 1 movie. I love it, and especially the way they handled the movie. And the visuals are really nice to look at."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the plot, characters, animation and ending. 
A great story about love, family and trust."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked how boots learned he doesnt have to be number one anymore and he has finally made friends
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie is a must see sooooo good
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie. Very funny and entertaining!
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"É muito simplesmente incrível, a animação muito característica é linda, a construção na parte inicial no filme é bizarra de boa, o início até a parte que o lobo aparece é perfeita, o filme continua incrível, mas o início é perfeito."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"everything on this movies is good, the story, action, and history all amazing."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible! beautiful animation and a story although simple can be exciting
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I bought this movie because I heard it was pretty good and pretty good is an understatement this movie as absolute perfection and to understand that you must watch the movie
"Feb 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So, this doesn't rise to the same quality as the first 2 Shrek movies for me. It was enjoyable, but I didn't walk out of the theater blown over."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"An absolute home run masterpiece! I heard the good reviews and had some high expectations and I was still impressed! The visuals, the plot, the characters! Was worth every penny seeing it in the theatre"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Refreshing with great dialogues, animation and even though I am an adult - I loved watching this. Plus, the dog steals the show"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Some really powerful messages in this film, covering for example the inability to cheat death, experiencing fear and fear of death, love and betrayal, trust and loss of it, recognising and appreciating what we already have rather than wishing for things, the power of forgiveness, the pitfalls of ego, and more besides. Some of the action scenes, especially towards the end, were rather repetitive and seemed to hold back the progress of the story towards its conclusion. Scratch below the surface of the wonderful animation and character portrayal and there are some profound doctrines of truth to be found"
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,The best animated movie I've seen in a long time !!🤩
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly, this is one of the best movies I have seen in 2022. It has amazing and unique visuals like Spider Man Into The Spider-Verse. It has a phenominal and mature story about growing up and knowing you can only live life once, so live it to the fullest. Seriously, this movie is on par with some of Pixars greatest films. Highly, highly, recommend this sequel to Puss In Boots and can't wait to see what the future of the Shrek franchise gives."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent! Well written story with themes of mortality and anxiety that adults can relate to. Beautifully animated.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,This. movie Is epic.It was just awesome.Whenever death arrives that whistle gave me goosebumps.It was Amazinh
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,thought it was a very cute movie very good kids movie.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good movie better then the first. I loved the beard it was pretty funny looking. The storyline was way better then part one.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Puss In Boots: The Last Wish arrived after a decade. But it was worth waiting because the animation and plot and everything is amazing. It should be the best movie DreamWorks have ever made. It is better than the first movie. But the first one is also good. The animation is better than the first one. So I give this movie 100/100 ratings. Best animated movie I have ever seen. You should watch this movie. 👍👍👍👍👍
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,All around great movie.....much better then what we thought.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie for kids ne and my kids enjoyed it
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Usually, sequels are terrible.  How pleasantly surprised we were by this gem!  We LOVE Puss in Boots, and this cartoon does a fantastic job of carrying on the Legend, and tugging on your heartstrings along the way."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I really liked it I was scared from the whistle from the wolf
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story Great action and great message of living life with consequences. The way they introduce death as a reality check is amazing as well bringing shine to panic attacks
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best animated movie out there.... It has such a good artwork, plot..... Everything is just amazing...."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme é simplesmente perfeito. Eu ja gostei do primeiro filme ( o colocaria como nota 4 de 5), mas nesse filme a animação dos personagens ficou muito melhor que o primeiro, realmente exploraram bem o que um filme animado pode oferecer de fotografia aos espectadores; o rotoiro foi muito mais criativo e bem explorado e os personagens são um melhor que o outro."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wonderful things happen when DreamWorks is on top of their game. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish takes what made the character enticing to begin with and elevates him, while also giving him a worthwhile journey full of emotion, fear, and comedy. The rest of the movie around Puss is equally entertaining. Salma Hayek is the perfect match for Kitty Softpaws who herself is elevated and doesn't feel forced. John Mulaney as Big Jack Horner may not be the top villain of the film but provides a loose and silly portrayal. Oh and who's the best villain in the film? Discover it for yourself but it's worth watching just for that. I'll just say, it's a thing of beauty."
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was pretty good! Dreamworks main antagonist in this movie was very good! The villain was lethal, and had that fire in him! Definitely cannot wait to see the next Puss in Boots movie!"
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a good funny movie.
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"good movie for family, but jokes only adults noticed, fantastic"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"é muito bom é melhor até mesmo que Sherk 2 e quem sabe ultrapasse toy story 3, espero essa qualidade em sherk 5!"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Only Perfect, most important animation movie of 2023, and have a good message not only for child but for adult too, absolutely perfect ❤️"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,took grandson and he enjoyed it. I got a few laughs too. Not an Oscar winner of course but cute and appropriate
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved how well it handled such adult themes such as death and family. The first 20 minutes or so was a bit iffy and made me wonder if I was going to enjoy it, and the many musical numbers were a bit annoying. But the story, the animation, and voice acting were all amazing. Interested to see where it goes from here"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Magnificent, beauty, action, funny and 100% better than Disney animations haha"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Puss in boots the last wish was so funny. Me and my family enjoyed it. Totally recommend you go see it
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Puss in Boots 2 I give this cartoon five stars
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hands down one of the best animated films of all time. The writing, characters and animation alone are enough but the story just hits different. Gotta watch this movie"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,The best movie of the year. End of story! This movie give me hope for Holywood. I hope for more movies like this!
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Overall good movie.  A little intense scary at times. Loved the romance and action scenes.  Good characters especially the Luna and her cat  home.   :)
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie reminded me of the golden age of DreamWorks! The animation that mixes 2D with 3D is phenomenal! The script is realy emotional and at the same time funny.

"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Peliculón, imprescindible"
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good, the animation, story, angle, conversation, character development, villains, plot, very perfect."
"Feb 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Very high quality animation. Makes me think “great production design”. A good heartfelt story, dynamic characters. Did not like the “dog as the best pet” part too much. But overall a good, imaginative, and emotional story "
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I dont think much needs to be said
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love how they showed different fairytales within their universe. The cinderella slipper, Hansel & Gretel, etc. I loved the Wolf, his parts were actually intriguing. His appearances were the best. Some parts were cringey but I understand it is still a movie for younger audiences."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is a thrilling adventure that will have you on the edge of your seat - and it's not just because of the swashbuckling hero himself. DreamWorks has outdone themselves with this latest installment in the franchise, and one of the highlights is the mind-blowing performance by Death Wolf.

This new character, voiced by the talented Idris Elba, is a force to be reckoned with. His menacing presence and cunning tactics make him a worthy adversary for Puss in Boots and his new allies. And when Death Wolf finally unleashes his full power, the results are truly awe-inspiring.

But Death Wolf is just one of many memorable characters in this movie. Puss in Boots, voiced once again by the incomparable Antonio Banderas, is as swashbuckling and charming as ever. And the addition of new allies like Dulcinea (voiced by the delightful Tiffany Haddish) adds depth and heart to the story.

ง

Of course, it wouldn't be a DreamWorks movie without stunning animation and plenty of humor. ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" delivers on both counts, with breathtaking visuals and plenty of laughs to keep audiences of all ages entertained.

In a world where animated movies are a dime a dozen, ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" stands out as a true gem. With its unforgettable characters, thrilling story, and mind- blowing performance by Idris Elba, it's a must-see for anyone who loves great movies."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is an absolute delight from start to finish, bringing back the swashbuckling feline hero we all know and love in a brand new adventure that will leave audiences purring with delight. With stunning animation, hilarious humor, and heartwarming moments that will tug at your heartstrings, DreamWorks has once again proven that they are the masters of family-friendly entertainment.

While Disney may have a storied history of creating classic animated films, ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" shows that DreamWorks is truly a force to be reckoned with. From the intricate character designs to the intricate fight scenes, every aspect of this film has been expertly crafted with care and attention to detail.

If you're looking for a movie that will transport you to a magical world filled with adventure, romance, and plenty of laughs, then look no further than ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish."" DreamWorks has truly outdone themselves with this latest installment in the beloved franchise, and it's a must-see for anyone who loves great animation and storytelling."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,The best movie of our generation just watching it made my life infinitely better

"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"no se puede decir mucho, pero es buena, no esperaba mucho de esta peli, y me sorprendió, 100% recomendad para verla incluso en cine, lo único no esperen algo inédito, es apuntado a niños, asi que el final es algo predecible, lo bueno, el perro he incluso risitos de oro, lo malo, la verdad nada, para el publico al que apunta, nada malo, incluso visualmente es muy buena."
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Very cute good family movie me and my 3 kids enjoyed it!
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best antagonist ever! No cap, death is over taï lung. Death to the top baby"

"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Great humor and beautiful animation
"Feb 25, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was really funny and cute for kids. I took my niece 3 and nephew 8 they laughed and totally enjoyed the movie. I recommend the movie for families.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent story line, action pack and entertaining from start to finish."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is how an animated film should be. Story, engagement, funny. LOVED THIS MOVIE"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,One of Dreamworks best movies and honestly one of my favorite animated films of all time. The Last Wish is just amazing all around and I'm really happy now that more stylized animation is being used by other studios in a really cool way. This movie was one of the last movies that I thought was going to be really good but I'm very happy that it went above and beyond what I thought it was going to be. The story is pretty cliche and generic yes but it's everything around the story that makes this film so good. The animation is incredibly. The Spider-Verse style works very well for this film and it still stands out from Spider-Verse in its own unique way. The characters and their own respective arcs are great. There really isn't one weak character here. Puss himself gets some excellent development and his journey of grabbing with the concept of death is very emotional and well written. Kitty Softpaws also has a really good arc and chemistry with Puss and Perrito has some really great moments. All of the villains here are great. Goldilocks and the 3 bears all have a good arc and Jack Horner is one of the funniest characters ever included in an animated film and works amazingly well as the irredeemable villain but the real standout here is Death. Death is probably one of if not the best Dreamworks villain. To have Death be personified and built up the way it is in the film is just something else. His interactions with Puss were always amazing. The humor was great as well. Pretty much every joke from Jack landed and all the other jokes were really great as well. Everyone involved with this film felt like they really cared about the characters and the story and that's what makes the film so great. I would highly recommend checking this film out as it's genuinely one of the best films of 2022 and one of the best animated movies ever.

"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolute amazing animation and history
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a good movie to take my 7 year old but there were some bad words that were spoken ..
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow.. for a ""Kids"" movie this movie really amazing. Visually it looks great the story is great with great characters and gets you in the feels. Really makes you think about life"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Cute family movie, I would recommend seeing it!"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was absolutely incredible. Everything from the comic book style animations in the fights, to the cold villain known as Death. The entire movie was a 10/10 and was excellent in quality."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,My grandsons loved it and so is Papa and Grammy. Funny with lots of adventure and a cute storyline. Great for the whole family!!
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is the best movie I've ever watched in my entire life
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing. Can't wait to see it again.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" absolutely took my breath away. This work of art provides everything you could ask for in an animated film. The animation was superb, with a slight action style that added a unique spark to the already beautiful visuals, which had such a variety of themes. Plus, the character design. I'm still getting over how amazing the wolf looked, absolutely horrifying but so fun to watch. The direction was one of the best I've seen in any animated movie, with stunning shots that I'm shocked other films haven't used. The worldbuilding was so compelling, with elements of fantasy and adventure so interesting and thought-provoking, and ideas so brilliant I've truly never seen anything like it. The voice acting was perfect, casting celebrities that are actually good at voice acting, and actors I've never seen before that still were great. The characters were set up so well, with emotional sequences and character building that was heartfelt and realistic, despite the movie being about talking animals and fictional creatures. The comedy was wonderful, with Disney parodies and fairy tale references, plus sequences that were extremely funny. There's practically nothing wrong with this movie- everything was so riveting and fun to watch, always entertaining you while keeping you in suspense. Overall, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, animated or not. I was invested throughout the entire experience, rooting for characters in their toughest moments, and genuinely tearing up multiple times. This movie is outstanding."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"He was arrogant, selfish, prideful, he was the Legend! But now he is truly a legend because he humbled himself. He found someone other than himself to put first. She saved his life with a gift! He redeemed himself and now lives his life with Value! I think us adults along with the kids need a movie like this to think about how we're living our life and it sure stomped on my toe! This is an amazing movie with an amazing cast, story and animation! 9/10 for me! And if you disagree that's completely fine but this is my opinion and you're free to have your own. By far my favorite animated movie through my lifetime so far! Highly recommend! And oh my goodness their relationship truly brought me to tears and I loved every second they were on screen together."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! I love that Dream Works is taking risks and evolving past the pixar animation style to make content like this.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"i liked when he said ""its pussin time"" but the bears were br*tish"
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Super funny and awesome characters. Gotta see it
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,amazing. great message.
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked the story.  Liked the humor.  Liked the idea of friendship /family.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the wolf in the movie.. very ominous character
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Brilliant story, this is what the big screen was made for. Clever, witty, funny with great characters, an absolute joy to watch will watch again and again."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a cute the kids enjoyed it.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muito bom! Animação linda, vilão assustador e engraçado. Retrata situações realistas, como, crise de ansiedade, problemas com a família, enfim muito bom 👏👏"
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not bad movies, not a fan of those effects tho."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Highly recommend. This movie is amazing, story wise and visuals. The Last Wish has rememberable characters.  There are new characters, which are really great, and there is another reoccurring character aside from Puss. The movie is strong because you didn't need to watch the prequel to understand what is going on. It is a feel good movie for both younger and older audiences. Again, I highly recommend."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie had no damn reason to be good.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Cara, A DREAMWORKS CAPRICHOU MUITO! Fez uma continuação de um spin-off de shrek, só quero ver quando lançarem shrek 5 rsrsrsrrs"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny and heartwarming. It made my bf cry because it was too cute. Highly recommend.
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic animation! I feel like it's the The Last Jedi/Iron Man Three of Puss In Boots, but done right!"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Esse filme foi simplesmente incrível, o estilo de animação é extremamente lindo, os personagens são muito cativantes, a história é muito divertida, além disso as lutas são muito empolgantes e o vilão é muito assustador, todas as vezes que eu ouvia o assobio dele eu me arrepiava.
Simplesmente incrível."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a lot of other people have said on the internet in videos and websites, this movie has been far more than just a movie for me. I saw this movie teased on poster at a cinema where I live. Me, who has watched the original Puss in boots movie and Netflix series as a young child, tought: ""Well, I have forgotten anyway what happend in the crap I watched back then. It won't hurt wasting my time watching this."" 
After I have watched this movie I had felt something which also occured to me when I watched: ""How to train your Dragon the Hidden World"" Other than the fact that the animation of the movie and the casting was just purely stunning, It really went sodeap. I never tought that I, who watches in my age World War movies and documenteries would feal such passion towards an animated movie. This movie made me watch ""The Adventures of Puss in Boots"" andthe original movie again. The love between Puss and Kitty or Puss and Dolcinea is for me even comparable with Hiccup and Astrid. There is so much to add to this movie. I couldn't imagine how someone wouldn't want to watch this movie. I would really recommend this mvoie for anyone, who is seeking to live his childhood life again."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"My experience with my family was wonderful! I saved lots of money by buying the tickets through you, thank you!"
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"great movie, with excellent writing and animation."
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Feb 23, 2023",POSITIVE,absolute gem a masterpiece one of a kind

"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"filme incrivel e os vilões são incriveis 
a morte
o joão
e a caxinhos dourados"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,i went from hating it even tho i never seen the first one or anything shrek to it bein a s tier movie
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme perfeito, surgiu para dar uma salvada nas animações, já que a Disney perdeu sua magia."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,best movie of all time
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,good movie but we always know how is it going to end
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Well done!  My 5 and 7 year old grandchildren loved the movie and didn't move once it started.  Enjoyed the customer service of the staff!
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"From story to animation this was a masterpiece. 
Surprisingly mature and funny."
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was just an okay movie. All three kids said the same.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"the film is very good, memorable soundtrack, great animation mixing a cartoon that made the difference, scenes that mixed very well the emotions they wanted to convey and an impeccable story.
I just don't give full marks because a part of the film ended up following an expected ""clichê"".
Even with this ""clichê"", the film managed to please, bringing excellent animation and design"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in boots. A loved character across the Shrek Universe. This was an amazing sequel and an absolute MUST see. All the characters were amazing with a perfect story line. But I must say, DEATH. One of the greatest villains of all time. When watching him he sent cold shivers down my spine. DreamWorks hit hard with him and it was an amazing choice to do so. 
        So I'm conclusion, I think this movie was amazing and had to be the best DreamWorks movie. The creators did well in everything and it came with a great outcome. In my opinion, I think everyone needs to see this action packed masterpiece. I'm a dog person. But, this was so good that it made me like Puss In Boots and other cats a lot, lot more! I thank the creators for making the global phenomenon Puss in Boots: The Last Wish."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"My wife and I, and our two grandchildren, eight and ten, thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  Lots of action, very funny, great graphics, and a, great storyline of good verses evil.  Fun movie."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Much better than the first part, from all sides!  First, the animation is so bombastic that even Spider-Man in Dimensions is not as good as here.  I'm just silent about the plot! HE'S THE BEST!"
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The story and characters are well written... 
And the animation is just ""chefs kiss""..."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dreamworks returns back to its true ambitious form in this seemingly-underdogged entry to what you forget is even Shrek-related. Heartwarming, endearing, and incredibly clever. Last Wish taps into real relatable fears and explores concepts relating to both children and adults. Character-driven and hopeful for the studio's future!"
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Even though I didn't like it still ROCKS🔥🔥🔥
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Towards the end when puss overcame his fears
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie is fantastic and overall I would rate it a 8-9/10. Surprisingly really good and might even beat shrek 2.
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best movies to come out in 2022. The plot was amazing and even the sub plots from side characters were outstanding. Death in this movie played a very chilling role one of the most fleshed out animated villains created. It's good fun for kids and adults very funny moments in this film. Salma Hayek did amazing as Kitty Softpaws  didn't even realize she voiced her by how well she did the chemistry between her and Antonio Banderas is almost perfect rating 10/10
"Feb 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was boring, It was predictable. Too many fairy tale references in it."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie! Hands down my son & I loved every bit of it.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie ever hands down
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really cute movie, very good."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Oh my... What a great, beautiful, and funny movie. My mom and dad loved it too, Jack Horner is the most scary and funny villain at the same time 🥶 thats a real psicopath 🤣, perrito 🥹🥲❤, I loved the bear family and goldy🥰, the cricket 😂, death or wolf 🤯😱😨, and of course Kitty 😍🐈‍⬛ and Puss in boots 👢 🐈 make this hole movie so entertaining. Congratulations to DreamWorks for creating this piece of art! ❤️🙏🥹. You must watch it! You won't regret it unless you're unhappy and hard to satisfy."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,We brought our grandchildren ages 3 and 5 to see this movie. The whole movie is fighting and visual effects.
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Puss in boots is honestly amazing this movie was funny full of heart and action prefect for kids and adults.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie!  I loved the animation style, the once every now and then bone rattling appearance of the villain, and the occasional different art style.  This movie is a movie that you can watch with your kids, loved ones, and friends.  I find that this movie is the current best movie of 2023."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie I've seen in YEARS, not just the animated genre."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is absolutely one of the greatest movies i've ever seen, i've seen it twice now and i just can't stop thinking about it, i always thought that if Dreamworks were to ever return to Shrek and its universe it would be some terrible cash grab like Shrek the Third, but Puss In Boots: The Last Wish has confirmed that Dreamworks still has the ability to make masterpieces of storytelling.
I highly recommend going in as spoiler free as possible, this is a must see for anyone, and definitely deserves the price of admission, don't pirate it, seriously, Dreamworks deserves to reap the benefits of creating masterpieces like this."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hey, you wanna see something cool? Then go watch this movie!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots was one of the most stunningly creative and beautiful animated movies I have watched. You can tell that it was created with love and passion. Not to mention, the story itself is wholesome and fun."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly with the use of so many characters the movie should have felt cramped. However the way the characters were designed so that they were easily sewn into the story worked. No character felt like they had too much or too little time on the screen, every character's amount of time on screen was just right.

Great for all ages, funny and well written."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"My first cinema experience of 2023, and what a good one it was. I didn't have high expectations - I decided on a whim to see it after two recommendations in separate, unrelated YouTube videos. I didn't even remember this is a sequel. Nevertheless, it was fantastic, and a fantastic standalone film. The animation style is delightful, and similar in many ways to Into The Spiderverse, with an overall painterly, comic book aesthetic and creative use of variable frame rate and colour. The story brilliantly balances real heart with cracking jokes. The characters are all super endearing and energetically acted - suave Puss and his old flame Kitty, effervescent Perrito, relentlessly, comedically cruel Jack Horner, surprisingly familial Goldi and her three bears, and the spectre following Puss everywhere. The story is interesting, taking someone who has grown to think himself untouchable and challenging him to stop thinking about himself for once, and along the way a loner learns to trust again, a dog with the saddest backstory finds a loving family, and an adopted child comes to appreciate her found family. So much else to love - the Shrek cameos, the touching portrayal of a panic attack, the in-universe theme song (""He is your favourite fearless hero""), the touches of anime in fight choreography. I can't wait to see it again."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"My 11 & 16 yr old wanted to see this so I grudgingly went along. Much to my surprise, I actually enjoyed it. Only odd thing was the merge of different types of animation for action scenes. It was an interesting idea but didn't work very well and looked weird. Otherwise, good story, good animation, better than Shrek"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,this was a 10/10 solid movie. Its a must-see if you are a fan of the Shrek universe
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Heartfelt. Promotes normal family values. Refreshing
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"this was the greatest film ive ever seen i watched it multiple times over, i never thought i would feel my heartbeat during a spanish cat movie."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie provided a lot of laughs. My 8 and 6 yr old children loved the movie!
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I didn't suppose that ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" would be so good. Starting with the plot - it's exciting and engaging, even for an older audience. It's a cute story about friendship presented humorously. The characters are well-written, and the plot is gripping. The graphic style of the movie is intriguing, as it sometimes mixes realistic 3D characters with pastel, hand-drawn landscapes. It looks excellent! I highly recommend watching ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" on a big screen; it's definitely worth it. One of the biggest surprises of the year, for sure."
"Feb 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"OK fairy tale, the villains were quite well made, the allies not so much.
The laggy style of fight animations made them very unpleasing to watch."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I adore this movie. This is my third time watching it in theaters and I enjoyed it just as much as the first. The best movie in the Shrek franchise.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing, most beautiful great GODLY film ever. Honestly, it's probably my favorite movie. The animation, the characters, the plot, all of it is great. (Spoilers) 
The wolf, Death, is one of the best villains I've ever seen. Jack Horner was hilarious and enjoyable as a villain, PERRITO. God perrito was great too. I just- this thing is too good. PLEASE watch this if you haven't. PLEASE."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is great, the animation is insane along with the fighting scenes🤧💖✨"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, and the seats were great, wings could be a little better but it’s a movie theater so I’m not really complaining. The surround sound along with the bass was amazing as well. Wolf was so well written as well as the message."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastically written movie with great visuals, great action, and a great message. High, high recommendation if you have any interest in this movie, and maybe even if you don't."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" understands its audience to a fault and delivers a film that exceeds expectations. With its colourful animation, heart-wrenching storytelling, and mature tone, this film proves that all-ages entertainment can be so much more than dull."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the absolute biggest surprise for a movie. The visuals are really cool, the voice acting is really well done and the writing is spot on. The best part is one of the villains is probably the best villain to come along in a long time.  Wow what a surprise!!! Go see this!!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"""The Last Wish"" might very well be DreamWorks' magnum opus; at bare minimum, it's one of their best by far. I have seen very few films that have successfully nailed such a strong balance of comedy, action, poignant moments, and -- surprisingly -- legitimate horror; that TLW manages to pull this off while being a mostly-child-friendly animated film is deserving of praise. While it doesn't quite reach perfection, it comes remarkably close. A must-see for anyone with even a passing interest in animated films."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Assisti hoje mesmo, mas já vi algumas partes no YouTube e levei alguns spoilers.

Por mim, a Dreamworks está de pé novamente e com um filme ESPETACULAR e incrível, Wagner Moura dublando a versão em Inglês é maravilhoso também!

Que filme!"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"In my entire life, I have never gone out of my way to rate any movie. Yet watching this…was just a pure pleasure. Never before did I enjoy watching something as I had with Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. I'm always an active critic, yelling in my mind on why the movie is terrible and unrealistic while I'm watching it, yet I didn't do that at all while watching this. 

The story plot line is perfect, it is somewhat bit more fast paced but there is 0 filler or unnecessary moments. Each and every part seems to contribute to a lesson or meaning, and really builds each of the characters that we see in the short amount of time (less than 2 hours). The buildup is solid and the ending is amazing.

The voice acting is flat down some of the best I've ever heard for any animated movie, fantastic and describes each character exactly. I actually never noticed this about any other movies but it really stood out to me from this one. 

Overall the movie is a 10/10, from a solid critics viewpoint."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The wolf hunter is one of the cooler caracaters I've seen in a movie for a while, puss in boots fearing him it's something really cool when the whistles begins, the plot of the wolf it's amazing, good movie"
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, great music, and great emphasis about what is family and friendship."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Nice, charming movie about with very cool animation style. Adds interesting depth to the Puss n Boots character as any good sequel should. Rare and encouraging to see that it gets more acclaim than its successor."

"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Very cleverly written.  One of the most entertaining kids movies I have seen in years.
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely hilarious! The entire cast was amazing, Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, John Mulaney and Wagner Moura KILLED IT! 

I don't watch movies twice, but I would watch this movie again and again."
"Feb 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I didn't expect this movie to be as great as it was.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Accurate representations of varying emotions, including panic,  it was genuinely funny and had intelligent callbacks to other DreamWorks films and helped reframe outlook on whats really important in life."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a masterpiece made in 2022 just an masterpiece
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"As ever, dreamworks producing masterpieces. It isn't a five stars because of some jokes that I specifically didn't like, but it's amazing."

"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was just incredible, went to see it with my sister today and i could not stop laughing, honestly i recomend watching it. Only flaw is that it's a bit short."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Kids loved the movie. Totally engaged for entire show.
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,The grandkids will  like it. Bit like Shrek but not as funny. Can see why it s taken the money it has. Not sure people of my generation ( 70+) are the target audience.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Didn't expect this from a animated movie. The most fascinated character was the death its animation and the death wistel made me goosebumps I loved it I will strongly recommend it

"Feb 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great actors, great visuals heavy-handed, simplistic, moralistic tale."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It was really good! I thought it might be a little too childish for my 10 year old but it was action packed and he loved it.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun for the whole family with a goofy but enhancing story and fun characters.

"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome you will enjoy fro end2end this movie !! I really like it
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"A movie that is somehow able to do the impossible task of being incredibly compelling for the two different audiences at once, adults and kids. From amazing animation to it's ability to tackle hard topics like anxiety and death in a way that is digestible. This film carries so much heart and achieves something rarely accomplished in any movie, let alone in a kids film."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good story like. Something for all ages.
Strong characters, and good intro of new characters"

"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Humorous, wholehearted, nostalgic, thrilling, fun, the message within the story is one worth knowing."
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie! All the characters are so interesting and overall, enjoyable. The animation is 10/10 and the story is awesome. A lot of subjects were treated such as anxiety, death, life, etc. For me, the best character was Perrito. He has such a lovely personality. His story is heartbreaking however, it doesn't shadow him as a victim but more as a role model. He's adorable and I would like to see more of him. My review is not professional but I recommend you to watch the film and enjoy each part ! :)"
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't even need Shrek 5 just give me more of this.
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Visual work of art!!!!
"Feb 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the theme good for both children and adults alike

"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a masterpiece. The movie was over 10 years in the making and it shows. Not a single part of it feels rushed, forced, or poorly done. It has gotten stellar reviews on all fronts because the movie is flawless in every regard. It's no wonder that a fantastically executed depiction of one of the most consistently beloved characters in history makes for the greatest movie of all time.
The movie utilizes an animation style inspired by Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, a movie similarly praised by critics, nigh on universally for its fantastic art. Dreamworks used this same system in the production of Puss in Boots, another example of why the decade-long wait after its original announcement contributed to how truly spectacular the movie is. The painting-like style of art created an atmosphere that felt very much like a fairy-tale as opposed to the just-off-reality vibe that CGI movies of the past had, or the totally devoid of realism style of completely hand-drawn movies such as Aladdin or the Lion King. Dreamworks gave us the best that there is in the animated world by refusing to hold back on the art style. The fact that all movies with higher acclaim amongst critics happen to be live action only serves to illustrate why this movie isn't considered better by so called professionals.
	This art-style helps contribute to the simply stunning fight scenes in Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. However, the visuals are not the only thing that makes the swordsmanship in this movie stand out. Unlike other movies using swords, The Last Wish holds a great degree of accuracy to real life swordsmanship. In every single fight, it is clear who is attacking who, who is on offense, who is on defense. Puss can be seen parrying, and then counter attacking with a well executed riposte just like in real fencing. Puss' fight with Death at the end of the movie is the most spectacular fight throughout, with both characters showing off the true height of their ability, utilizing their respective advantages in speed, dexterity, strength, size, cunning, and more and not just pointlessly slapping sticks together between them. What's more, Puss' use of a so-called ‘gatito blade' in his offhand, is highly consistent with the use of parrying daggers, which were quite popular in Italy and Spain for use in rapier fencing. Such historical accuracy is quite rare in TV shows and movies, and for it to be found in a children's movie where that is rarely a concern just goes to show how much effort was put into the movie. Finer details such as these serve to show just how great of flawless masterpiece this movie really is. What's more, every fight in the movie serves a purpose other than just violence for the sake of violence. They help create exposition, advance the plot, and develop characters, whether that be by showing ‘Big' Jack Horner's ruthlessness, the strengthening of Three Bears familial bonds, or galvanizing Puss to be brave and value his lives and the time he has with his friends.
The message of the story is found in the final fight scene. Without having to be explicitly said, the message is still clear, you should cherish every second. The movie also has much to say about how it's ok to be afraid, a lesson many young boys, and all men really, need to hear. It has a flawless and nuanced depiction of a panic attack, something that can't be said for most movies, and shows us that we don't always have as much control as we thought we did, and that's ok. Therein lies the elegance of Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. It is, at its heart, a children's movie, and therefore has the obligation to leave the audience with a clear and positive message. This is no easy task for a movie to accomplish without being heavy handed. Luckily, for the Last Wish, the movie is far from heavy handed, with every message in the story being flawlessly woven into the very essence of the movie, instead of being carelessly stapled on top like so many other movies do. The reward of being appropriate for all audiences and for leaving them all with a positive message is incalculable and one of the many reasons Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is greater than any other movie, despite their higher approval amongst critics.
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a work of art. It is not only accessible to all audiences, but entertaining to them as well. It surrounds a beloved character that is a known-quantity in his beloved status amongst all, and does him justice in innumerable ways. The movie's attention to detail, and sheer visual beauty set it apart from any other animated movie ever made, while its character development, positive messages, and ability to stay within a PG rating puts it far ahead the dark live action movies that dominate the highest rated spots amongst movie review websites. Dreamworks didn't hold back on this one and, on God, it shows."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The kids said they disliked the fact that they were almost swearing in a couple of the scenes. But they both really liked the puppy character.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Animation like spiderman univers, great and funny old fasion dreamworks story and finaly great film that we need"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hey Disney, are you watching? This is how you make an animated movie! Not box checking or trying to shoe horn in a message nobody needs to know. Good characters and a fun story, that's all we need. Great movie. I enjoyed it from start to finish. And it's been a while since an animated movie did that."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"When I first watched this movie, I was shocked at the amazing animation style that Dreamworks did in this film. Took insperation from Into the Spider-Verse, and made it 10x better. I HIGHLY recommend everyone to watch this movie."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"My god! This was amazing! My little cousins laughing and I almost cried in some scenes show the big contrast that age have on how you see life depending the stage of life. 

That scene between Perrito and Puss... many people (including me) were sobbing. What a great message, and the villains, show an stoppable force, an incomprehensible and unknown gift, and the punishment for a selfish wish. 

The animations is on point, the plot is well developed and the fact that this gave us a hint on what is coming... this is absolutely amazing and Oscars' deserving!"
"Feb 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie answers the question, ""Why are children so cruel, afraid and violent."" No plot. Terrible morals. Gratuitous fear. Queerphobia. Sizeism. I left half way through. 1 star."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,right up with shrek 2
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"The first film was a unsuccessful shrek spin off  ,dreamworks trying  to make the shrek universe survive without shrek but this redefines Puss in boots's character with accurate depictions of panic attacks and anxiety and packages all of that with beautiful stylised  animation and uses techniques such as slowing the frame rate of fight scene to create quick and rapid animation in the action scenes as well as adding a few bleeped sequences which dosen't alienate the film from kids but means the adults with the kids can enjoy the film so in conclusion just watch this film there's no reason not to unless you have some outlandish stereotype about animation and how it's for kids"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is amazing, it was revolutionary, a good and heart sequel.
Characters with captivating stories, extremely good villains, excellent story and animation, one of the best films from DreamWorks and the animated film industry that I have seen, I highly recommend it."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Maravilhoso! Recomendo mil milhões. As cenas de ação, comédia, efeitos, trilha sonora e dublagem e muitos outros que eu poderia citar aqui e ainda seria pouco. De forma resumida esse é disparadamente o FILME do GATO DE BOTAS mais bem feito e mais lindo que já assistir. Desde do começo ao fim, eu só me sentir bem, arrepiado e super animado toda vez que o LOBO aparecia, roubava completamente a CENA. Todos os personagens diretamente ligados a história tiveram um bom desenvolvimento e os personagens temporários, que eu não me esqueça, até eles tiveram um bom tempo de desenvolvimento. Não foram só aqueles típicos personagens que aparecem e não agregam em nada. tudo muito bem construído.

Eu poderia ficar aqui escrevendo o quão feliz eu estou de assistir essa animação. Como fã do gato de botas, amei de mais. Esse filme é MARAVILHO."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I've made an account just to tell you how great this movie is honestly this is the best animated movie I've ever watched everything about this movie was great!
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,The definition of how a franchise matures with its audience.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Just as everyone expected, a sequel to a spin-off to the Shrek franchise that took 11 years to arrive in theatres was the animated movie that took the world by storm. 

The Last Wish really did defy expectations, assuming people had any. The animation style was refreshing for the franchise, the humor was more balanced with the character-driven story, and despite maintaining three different villains the film feels solid rather than clunky. Instead of frequent pop culture references and dodgy jokes that pad for time in the later Shrek films, this Puss in Boots sequel weaves the influences of classic Spaghetti Westerns and swashbuckler films with a family adventure storyline and affirmative, positive themes about appreciating life and those around you. It knows when to be lighthearted and when to be serious, and introduces us to one of the coolest original villains in family animation - a wolf embodiment of death - by not holding back on the menacing aura and instead focusing on it; hopefully the sense of danger will encourage other franchises to stop oversanitizing their films. If I were in the movie's target audience, it would probably be a film I would swear by for the rest of my life (sort of like Shrek 2), but in this case I'll just call it a very good family movie that came out of nowhere.

I hope you're all ready for more Shrek because now it's basically guaranteed to happen. And they will likely be disappointing. (3.5/5)"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"man I have nothing to say... this movie is INCREDIBLY WONDERFUL, I loved its animation style the voice acting the villains the soundtrack and the action scenes, cute, and deep and I thought it was amazing"

"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie for the kids,  shows team works and end results of it."
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's more than just a cartoon. The story has deeper meaning about life, friendship, trust, unresolved trauma, and the loyalty of a dog. 

(Also Perrito's back story is the exact representation of humans that are far worse than animals.)"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"W movie, dont have to say anything else"
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best animations of recent years.

"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely INCREDIBLE movie. It's honestly life changing and so exhilarating, it inspired me to be a better person and was so moving and heartwarming. Beautifully made with such memorable characters who are so funny and emotionally intelligent, I love them all and I especially loved Death, the villain, he was so cool and awesome one of the best animated movie villains ever! Excellently written, the plot was charming and clever and so skillfully made. I didn't have very high hopes for this movie at first but it is a truly fantastic masterpiece and has restored my hope for the future of DreamWorks. Puss in Boots is my favourite fearless hero"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It had action from beginning to end.  My grandchildren really enjoyed.. and we laughed a lot.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A beautiful and fun movie, with one of the most memorable antagonists, that becomes a surprisingly emotional and heartwarming story which you can easily recommend to everyone no matter young or old!"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good movie. Watched it with my 9 year old. Can be intense sometimes but we had a great time.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"antes de ir a verla esperaba una pelicula infantil e inmadura pero la verdad me sorprendió bastante y se me hizo bastante graciosa y la animacion es increíble los personajes estan bien chistosos y esta muy chido que pongan referencias a shrek dejando en claro que no se han olvidado de el,lo cual para mi es un super alivio porque la verdad se me acababan las esperanzas de que ya no iba a aver mas shrek. dejando eso de lado la peli esta muy buena y la recomiendo bastante vayan a verla."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent story and message, a very fun movie, and great animation.

"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best animated movies I've seen in along time, the whole family loved it.  Disney needs to take some notes here…"
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is the definition of perfection.
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie really gave me goosebumps and made me tear from how nice it felt to watch a western animated movie that I can enjoy. 
I had accepted that animated movies just weren't my things anymore and had turned to anime, this movie however showed that it wasn't I that had changed, it was just the movies that had become stagnant and boring. 
I haven't felt such childish joy since watching treasure planet and I loved every minute of this movie.
I didn't dislike any part of it but the dog companion was a bit too optimistic at times and I would've liked a bit more depth and development with his character, the movie was pretty short and could've used a bit more time on the dog and the villain
Still, absolutely loved it and I've missed good movies like this so much that I honestly want to give money to the movie, cuz i'm scared of losing them"

"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dreamworks have hit a stroke of genius in the creation of this beautiful, highly stylized, humorous, and suitable-for-all ages action film. Puss' character feels extremely fleshed out and Kitty Softpaws is an interesting character that plays well with Puss' dynamic in this movie."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was a great way to bring the shrek/puss in boots series back to life. This movie is fun and great for shrek fans
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,perfect movie. the animation and story are not what i expected. Everything was better than i cud ever dream of
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"El gato con botas: el ultimo deseo es la revolucion de Dreamworks, se la destaca por una animacion increible, un villano muy intimidante y con una trama en donde los niños y adultos disfrutan, para mi fue increible"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, I can't describe it with just words"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Being hearing impaired I wish the volume could be a tad louder
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss In Boots: The Last Wish is the best film in the Shrek Franchise since Shrek 2. The story is great, The writing is amazing, The animation is absolutely stunning, the characters are well written, The callbacks and references to Shrek are nice and the themes are very deep and thought provoking. This is easily a Top 3 DreamWorks Movie and for that I'm giving this a 9.5-10/10 YEAH IT'S THAT GOOD!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"WOW!! WHO IS YOUR FAVORITE FEARLESS HERO?? PUSS IN BOOTS!! Let me say, the animation is fantastic! Having the animation blend with the water brush aesthetic was pleasing for the eyes. The characters were so much fun, especially the villains in the film. The story was well written, making it seem it took a long time to carefully write such a compelling story. This overall movie was such a treat for the Shrek universe and makes me excited to see what Dreamworks will offer in the future!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,An absolute treat to watch on the big screen. Mind blowing CGI & the sequel is way better than the previous one. Death The Big Bad Wolf was one of the most scariest villians ever made by Dreamworks. Absolute must watch❤️❤️❤️💖💖💖🤗🤗🤗
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Once the film finished, and the lights turned on, I turned to my partner and said: ""This had no right to be this good?!"" 

5 stars!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fantastic movie the animation is superb, mimicking some of the animation style of Spider-Man into the spider verse it is beautiful visually and as a story in whole. It departs from visual style of the 1st and Shrek style with a deep story about life much more than I expected from this movie I was not anticipating feeling some of emotions I did going into this movie. I would highly recommend. What it takes from in humor from the first movie it has double the heart and depth."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a cartoon movie lover, I have watched the movie called Puss in Boots, The Last Wish. I have watched the last Puss in Boots movie in 2011. It seems like it brings back our childhood memories. Due to the technology, the animation is better than the last movie 10 years ago. Puss in Boots is a cat with boots, a brave hero with nine lives. The movie starts with a fighting scene, and he lost the eighth life in the opening battle, and he only has one life. He started to be afraid to die and he wanted to find the wishing star that can give him back his nine lives.

On his journey finding the last wishing star, there are a lot of adventures awaiting and he meet unexpected characters, the one is his lover and the other is a dog, he named him Pero or Perito which means dog in Spanish. His life story shocks to the audience, but he has positive thinking about everything he faced in his life. Apart from Puss in Boots, there are villains who are trying to find the wishing star. There is also a villain is the Big Bad Wolf named Death who is trying to take Puss in Boots&#39;s life instead of trying to find the wishing star. If you watch the whole movie, you will know Death is not a villain. The fighting scene between Death and Puss in Boots is epic. Every time Death appears, it makes my bone chill. His style and background music are so artistic.

It is interesting that who got the wishing star, and you will find out because it is unexpected plot twist. Overall, this movie is really good and more than a just fun cartoon movie that a family gather and watch. The animation style and the story line of the movie are great, and I want to say Puss in Boots is coming back with great success."
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excelente peli muy entretenida y hasta con mensajes importantes para ninos y adultos. Ojalá el final de la película se cumpla, urgen películas animadas de calidad!!"
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Very cute and fun movie. Antonio Banderas did a great job reprising the role. Could've used a few more cameos.

"Feb 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A great continuation of the Shrek franchise but for a children's film it wasn't so great the character ""Death"" made the children in the cinemas I was in all scared"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,It was amazing. For sure the best-animated film of 2022. The fight scenes were great and I thought it was very funny
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,OMG THIS WAS SOOO FRICKING GOOD
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing animation style the story and characters are amazing 100% reccomend
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Honestly I was so impressed with the movie! I took my ten year old daughter to see it and we both really loved it! It was filled with clever lines and fun scenes but also really heartwarming moments about friendship and family. The animation was really well done but the style during action scenes changed to being similar to Into the Spiderverse which I thought was strange at first but still looked good. The voice acting and characters were all well written and all had their own character development which was meaningful. Definitely watch this movie as it's really great!
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent story involving all feelings, lots of fun."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,A great movie for the family. A wholesome story with a good message and a lot of funny moments!

"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"My family and I all enjoyed it, as well as my pets. I would watch it again because the topics, story, and animation were all so fantastic. In short, you should watch it if you haven't already! 9.5/10 for sure. Who is your favorite fearless hero? Puss in Boots, I say!"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,um filme visualmente lindo e que consegue prender o espectador
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,They better do a Shrek 5 after that tease at the end!!
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Can we all agree there will never be a villain like death…
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"PUSS always brings it home! Fun cast, fast paced and at a some points I didn't even feel like I was watching animation. I really was immersed in the story."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was funny and hilarious even for parents. There is a bit of scary moments where they encounter death so you need to think about that before you bring your child. My daughter is 7 and was scared and I even thought it was a little scary!
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movie seen after a long time. Must see. Puss in boots is absolutely magnificent. Story, animation, cast, direction is top notch. Would recommend everyone to watch this movie."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Muito melhor que o primeiro filme!
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss In Boots: The Last Wish made me sign up to this platform to give a review, that's how good it was. 

The film's animation and art style is amazing, blending stylized 3D visuals with beautiful 2D animation and effects to create a visually appealing movie, on the lines of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse.

Then we get the story, a story that deals with the themes of life and death so maturely that you forget this is supposed to be a family-friendly children's movie. And that's because it's a movie for everyone who's protagonist just happens to be your favourite fearless hero, Puss in Boots. 
I haven't seen a film deal with this theme so maturely in so long. The acceptance of one's own mortality being a reason to find things worth fighting for in your one life. 
PIB might be the best interpretation and dealing with said theme i have ever seen. 

And at the heart of it all is a film that doesn't take your time for granted, being around 100 minutes long, short for this current age of cinema, keeps the pace going whilst allowing for those slow moments to make you feel Puss' every thought and feeling on his latest adventure. 

And plenty of fun and entertainment to be had. 

No matter how old you are, you need to go see this movie"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"My expectations were pretty low but during the vision i immediately realized how good of a movie this is. 
A delight for the eyes and for the soul.
Must see"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was as good as everyone says, the graphics are great, the theme is simple but it's written to perfection, and the character development is phenomenally good, not to mention the antagonist is just a piece of art. Overall great movie would definitely watch again"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the greatest Animation film like the style of the animation the character what a movie take note Disney
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"So well directed, I love every second of the movie absolute classic this will become. I advise all to watch this master piece!"
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"The greatest animated film in awhile… The existentialism that Puss portrayed in this film really broadens the theme and brings it all together in the end. I would not walk, but run to the theater to see this film. 

100/10, strongly recommend."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Cute movie. I didn't expect it to be so deep lol. I would recommend.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Initially, you walk in thinking this movie is just for kids, this movie won't be anything but another kid's movie. but then after a glorious one hour and forty minutes of amazing voice acting followed by outstanding animation, you've realized you just witnessed the greatest piece of the film created within the last century. Not only were the protagonists of the story amazing in all their regards, but the antagonist added way more than expected making this film such an outstanding piece of cinema."
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss In boots: The last Wish is a very enjoyable animated film that has one of the most iconic animated characters, Puss in boots. I really enjoyed the new animation style they used for this film. The story is also really engaging to the viewer with puss and boots on the last of his nine lives and the new villain that is introduced in this film, Death. Death is one of the darker villains I’ve ever seen in a kid targeted animated film, but there is many factors in the film from silly humor and silly characters that even out the tone of the movie. Overall I really recommend this film or just to the younger audiences but to everyone who enjoys watching animated films.

-Eric Bautista "
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Best 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life!
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Nearly perfect, the only thing I'd have be different is the British characters, oh my god Americans can't write English people to save their life, also how they kinda ruined the ending by spelling out the message of the movie And just screwing over the sweet subtlety the rest of the movie set up"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,The best dreamworks movie ever
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,absolutely loved this movie! I am bilingual (Spanish & English) and loved the accuracy and incorporation of the Spanish in the movie. I enjoyed the fact that it was tailored to the aging demographic while also having the flair and eye catching aesthetic that children enjoy.
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of my favorit movies ever.
Good Perrito :)"

Después de probar la formula de animación con ""Los Tipos Malos"" se la juegan con esta película de ""nuestro héroe favorito"", dejando la vara alta tanto en animacion, trama y banda sonora.

"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,a good cheering up movie
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie of 2022, and easily top 5 of all time. It deals with both Puss' fear of his own mortality, and his morality, going from everyones ""favorite fearless hero"" and flying solo to traveling with his new friends. I hope it sets up for Shrek 5."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Simplesmente adorável é um filme pra reunir a família.
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely amazing film to see for the return of the spin off series.

"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow! This film was perfect! I’m a huge movie buff so it’s sooo refreshing to see something so entertaining. I enjoyed Into the Spiderverse, but this one if anything might have out performed it. The script, the characters, the action, the comedy, it was the finest form of entertainment. Don’t trust me? Go see it for yourself! What a fantastic film!"
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was great they improved the style alot and i want to see it in the next shrek movie
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely Incredible! So many twists and emotional rollercoasters. It was amazing.

"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,I went to the wrong theater and I’m sad but I’m sure it was great
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,As far as a stand-alone movie goes not too bad but as far as finishing out the puss and boots portion of the childhood I had it was a great time.
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its purr-fect and the animation is so good, and death is the best dreamworks villain."
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Good funny family movie. We all enjoyed it kids from 8 to 18.
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Beautiful movie! A must see with the family!

"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,It’s a pretty good movie had the theater to myself
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"5/5 Stars for me, The Last Wish takes an exceptionally mature route route while also maintaining the humor and lighthearted nature that made up the first film back in 2011. The Animation is amazing, obviously inspired from Spider-Man: Into The SpiderVerse. The message about friendship and not wasting your life was perfectly depicted. And Death/The Grim Reaper is now among my favorite DreamWorks characters, I really hope we see more of him in future projects."
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Gostei muito como a dreamwork manteve a essência do gato de botas e que vilão sinistro meus amigos.
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very enjoyable movie for all age groups, very relatable jokes from the franchise we all know and love."
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Biggest surprise of 2022. Fantastic animation and a great story with good morals, well written characters, and a great soundtrack. This movie is hilarious and is fun for the whole family!"
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie perfectly exemplifies the social construct we know as death. In the film, Puss is chased day after day by the reaper of death. But in the end, he simply says no, leaving death only to ponder pursuing Puss in the first place. It's moments like these in film, where we are reminded of the game we play. Puss, like all of us, has something inside him that he loves and doesn't want to go away. We thank you Puss. Thanks for letting us spend a day in your boots!"
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,A must see movie with the family
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"amazing film, art, animations and perfect soundtracks with a beautiful ending, I recommend it, from beginning to end it is a splendid film."
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Oh man! The film is too good. The story is superb. I loved it. Must watch.
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Excelente animação. Apenas a dublagem BR de alguns personagens que ficaram ruins.
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Cinematic Masterpiece. Not even joking. Not a single cringe meta joke, just flowing and refreshing humorous dialoge. Not only is the story really well crafted, but every scene is perfect and enjoyable. Emotionaly grasping and engaging, every character is designed to perfection. Not a single try to rely on Shrek or other already famous characters, Puss In Boots stands as a lone and immaculate Protagonist. Absolutely Oscar worthy not even kidding. Go see it, its scary, touching, funny and heartwarming at the same time. I will watch the movie again next week on my own and you should too. 10/10 would absolutely recommend! Almost forgot the crisp and clean animation that is perfect on its own already. Absolute eye candy!"
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a cute movie with a decent story BUT for a kid movie I could have done without the bleeped out cussing.

"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,the movie was far from bad its just that is overhyped its not bad but people where hyping it up like it was the best movie of the decade.
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Imagine being avatar way of the water and being in production for a decade only to get beaten by puss in boots on rotten tomatoes
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,It had a variety of good art style's and emotional moments that everyone can relate to
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,A good theme and morals for older kids as well as for adults.
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,pretty cool i'd say.
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"DreamWorks definitely took the Crown of 2022 from Disney. I watched 'The Bad Guys' , and thought it was definitely a new step for DreamWorks, as it showed us what animation can give if done correctly. Puss in Boots, The last Wish didn't just do animation correctly, it perfected it. It has a great story which at sometimes can be dark.  Great Character's with well written and each has there own charm. Humour which is funny for children and adults. And best of all, animation with heart, soul and passion put into it. Whether that be it's cinematography, backgrounds, characters, art style or world building, it's those little details like that, that have given animation itself a better name. It's movies likes these that gives me hope, that the animation  industry will wake up more, and realise that people actual want effort for a change, and not the same old way to make money.

Animation - 10/10
Story - 9.5/10
Characters - 10/10
Humour - 9/10

Final Score - 10/10"
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think this movie had great animation quality, and was visually stunning. It had a great story line and plot and is definitely worth watching!

"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Witty, entertaining and beautifully animated. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is undoubtedly an excellent film with a formidable villain and jokes the whole family will enjoy."
"Feb 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Meh...ok the storyline itself was okay but just a little too weird and my grandson was like ""who is little Jack Horner"", thinking they could have used a more recent bad guy so the kids could relate."
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"good for whole family, all ages"
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't usually review movies but feel the urge to, after seeing Puss in Boots The Last Wish! It's been a long time since I came out of the cinema feeling pure joy for a film. I am one of those people who loved Shrek 1 and 2, deciding not to watch the sequels and spin offs after so when I heard about this Puss in boots movie, I wasn't jumping to see it. My partner saw the trailer and was eager for me to watch too. Once I'd seen the trailer I knew there was something special and different happening with DreamWorks this time!

Obviously the visuals were the no.1 thing that drew me to the film. I loved the inspiration they took from Into the Spiderverse. I also see a bit of Arcane and Wes Anderson's Fantastic Mr fox! The fight scenes are epic like Attack on Titan.

The characters are hilarious, and I loved the themes that played throughout. If you've ever experienced anxiety or depression and have started therapy, this movie will probably stir up your emotions (hopefully in a good way). I absolutely recommend everyone see this movie. If DreamWorks keeps this creative team, I'd be excited to see what they'll make next. This is the kind of creation that Disney is falling behind on."
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Completing the return to form for DreamWorks Animation that began with Abominable and continued with The Croods 2 and The Bad Guys, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish just might be one of the studio's best films since How to Train Your Dragon 2. With gorgeous Spider-Verse-inspired animation, exhilarating action sequences - though not quite as jaw-dropping as The Sea Beast -, a chilling villain, well-defined characters, some cameos that felt like reuniting with old friends and some really good lessons about coming to terms with your own mortality as well as a beautiful new logo for the studio that's arguably better than the short-lived one from HTTYD 3, Puss in Boots 2 just might be one of the best animated films of 2022. A visually stunning, darkly humourous fantasy adventure that's possibly one of the best installments in the Shrek franchise since Shrek 2."
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,The combination of different types of animation was amazing!
"Feb 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,This was not for children under the age of 7 it had too much violence for the little ones.
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,it was funny and gave a valid life lesson ong
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wolf/Death verry sexy, would smash"
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was the first animation I watched in 10 years. I was blown away by the artistic style, camera movement and unforgettable cast of characters. Although I'm 22 I was enjoying this move as if it was made not for kids, but for adults."
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"It exceeded my expectations in terms of plot! It was much more nuanced than the previous movie. All of the characters were once again lovable and with distinct personalities. In some ways, there were many cliche and meme-y moments, but even so, it didn’t bother me at all and simply added to the movie’s charm. Though those moments were cliche, they all served a purpose in sharing a slightly deeper meaning when thought about in a more serious manner. However, the animation style wasn’t better in my opinion. I know many people enjoyed the more cartoony style in this movie, but I think I prefer the older one. This one had frame rates that were slightly too low for me and sometimes the action felt like the theater was experience screen lag. I also appreciated the detail in the first one more. (Slight spoiler) The Last Wish tackled themes of death (and the fear of it) as well as found family, appreciation, pride, and more. I was thoroughly impressed at how the producers executed these themes in a way that is entertaining and for kids while being very honest about them."
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"such perfect, dreamworks perfect, everything perfect"
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Super great story, amazing visuals, and it seems to be a movie that we didn't know we needed."
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Phenomenal. Brilliant animation, mature themes, top-notch jokes, and fluent storytelling. What else could you ask for? 
No wonder everyone loves this movie. 
Not just for families, not just for kids. Animation is a medium, not a genre, and this movie takes full advantage of that. EVERYONE should see this film."
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"A wonderful sequel in almost every way, the plot, character development, animation, style, story telling are all surprisingly better than the former movie, except one little caveat for my personal taste--Kitty is not as alluring as the original film"
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Good kids movie i enjoyed it lots of action and heart filled moments that grabbed your attention!!
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,This cracked me up from start to finish. I loved how they worked so many fairy tales into the film.
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,It is the best movie I've ever seen in my entire life.
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,All of us were laughing)) including 2 kids 13 years old and 6 years old).
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie has No right being so Good!
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Made my gf not wanna leave me!!!
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Took my grands and they LOVED this show!
"Feb 13, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie is everything i've been searching for in an animated film. i've seen it in theatres 3 times in the last week and plan to see it many more before it's taken out of theatre. incredible work
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't really find myself watching movies like this, but for a movie that I wouldn't usually be interested in, it is done perfectly.

If you are interested, you should watch it."
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,There was nothing to not like about this movie it was great the humor was in point I loved every minute of this movie for sure.
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Perfeito!! O romance era realmente interessante, os gráficos lindos, e os vilões eram tão bons que você queria saber mais sobre eles. As cenas de medo quase me davam um ataque cardíaco, porque mesmo você sabendo que o herói principal não iria morrer, ainda parecia que o lobo iria acabar matando ele, já que ele era tão mais forte. Além da tocante cena do ataque de ansiedade, os produtores deixam um tempo para o personagem se recuperar, que é muito realista algo que não esperava de um gato do universo de Shrek."
"Feb 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Didn't see the original Puss when it first came out, but over the Christmas season, I chose to be sentimental and watch for some feel-good joy to see the adventures of a furious male cat as he strives to control the world. In addition, the settings and tone made it enjoyable to watch Puss roam, be slinky, and sip milk. The movie also looks good and has a cartoonish color scheme, so even though it's not ""Tom and Jerry,"" many adults, found it to be entertaining to watch. Antonio Banderas's performance as the voice of Puss is excellent, and the work and on-screen chemistry are also superb."
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Faz tempo que não assistia uma animação que me fazia dizer Wooooooooow !
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"This Movie is very fantastic. My white family laughed at this movie. New villian, New animation style. Congratulations to all, who maked the movie. Congratulations to DreamWorks for hard work. In my opinion, we need shrek 5 , which i dream to this New movie they will add, at the end: ,,puss marry kitty,, . I hope shrek 5 will ge good :)"
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Who is your favourite fearless hero? Who is your FAVOURITE FEARLESS HEROOOO
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best film I've seen so far. Great animation, a good story, and great laughs. Still think the ending is a bit Hollywood-zy but overall, impressive."
"Feb 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It is good, would recommend for a family get together on a Sunday for fun and relaxation"
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing animation, good story.  Held out 4 year olds attention most of the time, which is not easy to do."
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,the movie was fantastic
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Too much Violence for little ones
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,very funny 😁  loved the movie
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, completely exceeded my expectations! Characters were fun and multidimensional and the message told though the plot was very meaningful. I will definitely be revisiting this again as one of my comfort movies."
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely wonderful movie!! Enjoyed every bit of it! Now I have to go back and rewatch all of the Shrek movies again! Best movie of the year!
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Um grande filme onde esqueceram a militância e funcionou muito bem.
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,I really liked what they did with Goldilocks and the 3 bears. But the whole movie was awesome.
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Exceptional. One of the few movies i actually really enjoyed and gotten me intrigued from the start to the end. Loved the comic book animation, which will age greatly instead of trying to look realistic and look much worse when new tech came. The story and character development too. 10/10 for both adults and kids"
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing Art Style and new characters Pretty Neat
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"The story, the characters, the jokes are very very fun! 100% would recommend to everyone."
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muy buena película, para todas las edades!"
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a lot better than it needed to be when studios seem to just pump out uninteresting sequels and spin-offs to grab the cash of poor parents who begrudgingly bring their kids to watch annoying talking animals and bright colors. 

No, this film goes hard. From the fresh animation style to the well written and acted script to the dazzling action scenes, you can really tell the animators and everyone actually put heart and effort into making something pretty amazing. 

It's one of those ""wow where did this come from?"" moments that makes you forget this isn't Pixar - this is a sequel to a spin-off of a 4 film franchise of which it breathes new life into. 

Along with Sony's Spider-man: Into the Spiderverse and The Mitchells vs the Machines, this Dreamworks film should be a wake-up call to Disney and Pixar who are now at serious risk of falling behind with their tired animation and direction. 

The Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature is well deserved."
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the story and the fact that its pointing towards another Shrek movie. Also loved the fact that theres no WOKENESS in it!!!
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,A remarkable showcase of the power of anthropomorphic media
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,10/10! Best animated movie I've seen in years!
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the, if not THE best animated film of 2022! Dazzling visuals, well-developed characters, and an engaging story had me on the edge of my seat the entire 1-hour and 40-minute runtime in the theater. In addition, the moral of the story, living your life to the fullest and not fearing death, has got me thinking deeply as it was brought about in a very profound way for an animated, family-targeted movie. Great job, DreamWorks, this may be your best to date!"
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"had me in tears, enjoyed the ending so much too"
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Even better than the first! Awesome new characters, great story, new songs, and funny. Fans of all ages will love it!"
"Feb 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,Fun & my daughter loved it. Even ok for dads!
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,A delightful movie for kids and adults.  This movie should get 6 stars!
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,My son and I loved it.
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wonderful movie! The animation graphics and plot were amazing, fun for both the kids and adults."
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfect movie. Absolutely entertaining from beginning to the end.
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie is fantastic!!! The movie can work for kids and adults.
"Feb 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"GREAT GREAT MOVIE!! enjoyable, funny, witty & great for the whole family!! would see again!"
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the best villain character ever created in DreamWorks. I can't wait to see him again.
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,I really like this movie! My favorite is the orphan dog!!
"Feb 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Was not nearly as cute as the others. The plot was ok. It had death pursuing Puss as a main theme but the kids sitting next to me really didn't like that. One elementary aged girl said, ""don't' they know this is for kids?""

I was fighting dosing off for the first 30 minutes of the film, had to grab a coke to stay awake."
"Feb 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,We had to leave early because the sound level was painful. Even with earplugs it was too loud.  Pity because the plot was very well written!
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"A kid's movie unlike any other. Fantastic animation, themes, and character development."
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing story,  loved the characters, the animation was so beautiful!! I loved it!!"
"Feb 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"My grandkids said, the character Death wasn't exciting enough."
"Feb 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was very loud and I thought the end was a little scary.
"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was fresh and interesting throughout. Leaves you believing there will be another movie to follow.
"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Went into this movie with high expectations and was not disappointed, from the animation to the story telling it's definitely a must see for families!"
"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything about this film is amazing
"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went to the theaters with high expectations, considering all the good reviews, and believe it or not,they were exceeded IMMENSELY. I'm shocked at how spectacular this film was. It's nearly tied with Shrek 2 as my favorite Shrek related film, it's not quite as good, but it came pretty close. That alone should tell you how good it is. The animation has a ""Spider-Verse"" like feel,and the action scenes were spectacular. Now lets get to what EVERYONE is talking about, the villain, the literal personification of DEATH. Death is honestly such a scary villian for a kids movie. I was shocked at how intense and suspenseful his scenes were, everytime you heard his whistle, you new stuff was about to go down! I liked Jack Horner as a surprise villian, he's existentense was kinda spoiled by social media, BUT I won't spoil anything here. Goldie locks and the three bears were a fun addition. I'm shocked the film didn't feel overstuffed. Puss in Boots was very good, having to face his mortality and some heavy subject matters. Kitty Softpaws also had a good arc about trust(and the world trust wasn't said a million times like a certain Disney movie) Perito was a funny addition that never got annoying. I love how optimistic he was considering his backstory. This movies story was dark, about Puss being down to his last life and looking for the last wish, and Death hunting him down. This is a MUST SEE, for all ages. 10/10, one of the best DreamWorks and Shrek related films."
"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed the movie. Quite a few belly laughs.  The anxiety scene was amazing.
"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, amazing animation and always a good laugh"
"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Grat movie! Wholesome and filed with a lot of life lessons. Totally recommend.
"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"With a catchy story and a sinister villain, Puss in Boots The Last Wish is an amazing experience that i recommend for all the public's."
"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best animated movie of the year, I didn't know dreamworks were making a sequel for 2011's ""Puss in boots"" until the movie came out and i didn't know what to expect from it. entering the theater and I thought it will be one of those generic kids movies, to my surprise it had very touching scenes like when Perrito calmed down Puss when he had a panic attack which is something you don't see in kids movies, or at the end when Puss realizes that he doesn't need to wish for his 9 lives to be restored and that he should cherish his last life. Also goldilocks and the three bears crime family thing was weird in a good way they had some very heart warming moments like when Goldilocks said that she wants a real family and not the bears, the bears were sad to hear her wish but they agreed to help her later on Goldi saves kid bear while saying that the family she has is just right. Big jack horner not a lot to say casual rich power hungry character just that he is a maniac he doesn't care for his crew or anyone really besides himself and to my surprise he isn't annoying just a grown up child (sad backstory though). Death, there isn't really anything i can say about him that wasn't said before he is the perfect villain he terrifies Puss THE LEGEND who was ""never touched by a blade"" fear for for his life Puss ran away to Mama luna's cat house some time (story happens) Puss meats death while seeing his previous lives as they mock him for being a coward and not the legendary ""PUSS IN BOOTS"" and he keeps convincing himself that the wish will make him the legend once again and then Death arrives remembering their previous encounter Puss starts to run (he also saw Death when he kitty softpaws and the bear family jack horner fought for the map) he heard Death's and took off. Puss fights Death one last time but this time he appreciates his last life then Death leaves and he says to Puss ""You know we'll meet again right? I know Lobo (Lobo =Death) "" .so yeah good movie perhaps i jumped places hear but good movie Puss's relationship with Kitty is very good Perrito is amazing he is so positive that he doesn't realize that his tragic past is tragic. Good jokes very good fighting scenes (similar to ""spider -man :into the spiderverse)
Go watch it in the theater it is the best movie now 12/2/23 for the American 2/12/23 it is worth a watch in the theater make this movie earn why it deserves which is more the Avatar way of the water
One of the best movies i have ever seen a 10/10 for what it's trying to be and a 10/10 for a movie"

"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,the movie was awesome
"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Surprisingly great movie!!!!
This is the best puss in boots movie we have ever seen!"
"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es una belleza la animación y como van alternando de una manera muy orgánica los diferentes tipos que maneja, la trama es buena, predecible pero eficiente, funciona y es lo que importa, los momentos de comedia y musicales están muy bien integrados y no se siente nada fuera de lugar. Gran película, es increíble lo que logro Dreamworks."
"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie! The animation is beyond beautiful to look at the score is flawless the action and story is so well put together. Each character beet flows well and ends in a fun and bombastic interwoven climax that is a joy to watch every time! It's themes about self and the fears of life are handled with love and care. One of my favourite films!!!
"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining from start to finish!
"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in boots: the last wish is fun, exiting and sweet while still proving that even after 10 years people are interested"
"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was absolutely amazing, one of the best movie of 2022 and one of the best animated movie. Disny, pixer and sony makes more childish animations but DreamWorks movies are for everyone."
"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"First Puss in Boots movie I've seen, incredible movie and will be seeing the previous movies, definitely best of the 2022 with incredibly lovable characters. I was so satisfied with the movie that I created a rotten tomatoes account to give it a good rating."
"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,seeing everything come together at the end was great
"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,MARAVILHOSO MELHOR FILME QUE JA VI NA MINHA VIDA
"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"No recuerdo la última vez que me sentí feliz y entusiasmada al terminar de ver una película, no siquiera con Pinocho de Guille. Amé enormemente Puss In Boots the Last Wish. 
Un grande Dreamworks."
"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,AMAZING 100/10 WOULD RECOMMEND!! BROUGHT BACK MANY CHILDHOOD MEMORIES!! 3
"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Very satisfied I really enjoyed this movie
"Feb 11, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a cute movie with a very serious underlying story about life in general. Took my family to see it and we enjoyed it.
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Most extraordinary movie. Antonio's best work ever! My eyes were popped out because I was so appalled! I was begging for more!
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Good fun movie. Kids will enjoy it

"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing sense, brilliant art style, incredible story with heartwarming moments!!!"
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Another great Puss in Boots. Lots of action and fun and fantastic voices.   Totally enjoyable!
"Feb 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,Bland unforgettable and unfunny. Avoid
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,It changed my life. When I went to the theater i had high expectations bc I saw the good reviews and the memes about it and it really lived up to the hype. The art-style which is great and the excellent music made it fabulous. 10/10
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie defies all expectations of what should have come of this franchise. After Shrek 2, DreamWorks used this beloved franchise to milk as much money out of our loved characters as possible. The first puss in boots movie is a generic, bland adventure film however; this movie is a massive bounceback for the franchise. The lovable characters and the beautiful animation carry this movie along with the fun plot and the amazing settings. The bleeped cursing from the characters is a bold comedic flair that only adds to this masterpiece."
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautifully animated, great story and amazing characters"
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was fire the villain is the best part
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best animated films in years! 
Exceptional Film"
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Truly incredible, The Last Wish is a feast after a famine of truly great animated movies, 10/10 would watch again over and over for the rest of my life."
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Watched this movie with Family! It's such a fun wholesome movie to watch with Family that shows you that you need to live life to the fullest and I 100% recommend this movie if you like the Shrek Movie!
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"İf u deep dive its really great 
Watch it!
💗💗💗
/İ was crying when the pup said his own past 😭/"
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Dreamwork's decision to reprise a beloved character has paid off. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a truly amazing film. Beautifully animated with an absolutely terrifying villain in Death.
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"an incredible movie, really interesting and fun to watch, it has an interesting plot and good humor, good animation and an excellent sequel, it left me reflecting on the end. simply a masterpiece"
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is amazing after I got out of the theater I rewatch it again I love this movie I totally recommend watching this movie and I can't wait what's going to happen to DreamWorks new movies in the future
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a blast. A quality addition to the Shrek franchise. While maintaining the humour and fun, this film is surprisingly mature as it deals with themes of mortality and introspection. The cast is stellar and the visuals are top tier. The best DreamWorks movie since ""Shrek 2""."
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie has a heart. With a very good animation quality and style, the movie really stands out in those areas. The story is predictable from the middle of it but it is told in such a way that when the end comes it leaves you wanting more as the characters already won your heart."
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"The animation was spectacular! I loved all the characters, especially the villains. There was some confusion for me when certain people teamed up at the end without verbalizing anything to each other, but other than that, it was a solid movie.
Some reviews say the movie isn't appropriate for kids, but in general, yes, it is if they are at least five or six in my opinion.  
It is rated PG, meaning parental guidance is suggested as some material may not be suitable for children, so there will be things that might be surprising (I suppose)
The movie says the word hell, and they do use a bleeping noise to suggest when characters are cursing. (Obviously, they don't use the words, it's just a bleep.)
The violence is very cartoonish. The main villain might spook a child under the age of five."
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,My baby boy George loves this movie and he's got a big U know what
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Stunning visuals, great animation, and fantastic development! This movie is by far the highest quality in Dreamworks' catalog. This movie somehow managed to juggle three protagonists and three conflicts flawlessly. The art is stunning with dynamic backgrounds and a painted esthetic that fits with the fairytale theme. The animation is fluid and dynamic; from changes to the frame rate to the visual effects. This movie should be an inspiration for the future of Dreamworks animation."
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie combines action and fear in a way that I just love. The main villain in this movie is menacing, and I just wouldn't expect that from a Dreamworks movie. The ending is pretty good and I'm pretty sure Puss in Boots is my favorite Dreamworks character, overall a awesome movie. -9.5/10"
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is AMAZING!!!!!!This movie's art style is so unique and the characters are all great.The main villains are really good.The wolf is so menacing and good.The fun is non-stop and can't wait for the 3rd, if it is made.Puss and Kitty have great chemistry and purrito is adorable.There is nothing bad about this movie.Amazing movie and the best Shrek movie ever. -9/10"
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme muito bom! Bela lição de moral, filme emocionante e comovente. Aquele filme de dar um frio na barriga. Animações otimas e efeito sonoros nota 10. Muito bom a dream works cada vez melhor."
"Feb 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny! Exciting! You cared for the characters. If you pay attention there are cool references to other characters in the world of fairy tales!
"Feb 9, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the greatest movie of all time
"Feb 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Peak animation. Oscar incoming!
"Feb 9, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is amazing enjoyed every second of it!
"Feb 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing story line with great lessons for people of every age. Fantastically written characters that show growth throughout the film (besides the antagonist who is almost comically evil). And above anything else, the art and animation is probably some of the best I have seen in a very long time. Pixar could never. Pandora from avatar is skidrow compared to the artwork and attention to detail in this movie. Yes the writing is a little cheesy at times but this is also a kids movie so I won't hold that against them. Overall, might be my favorite movie of the last year."
"Feb 9, 2023",POSITIVE,An absolutely astonishing movie with and incredibly amazing plot!
"Feb 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Greatest movie I've seen in a long time. The animation is dynamic and unique. The comedy hits every time. The characters are impeccable and the villains are perfect. AND THE MUSIC. I cannot get enough of this movie. 100/100 PLEASE SEE THIS MOVIE!
"Feb 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hasta hoy la mejor película del 2022 y lo que va de 2023 en pelis animadas. 
Buen antagonista, Sub tramas interesantes, Humor agradable para nada pesado, evolución del protagonistas y los que lo rodean y buen mensaje al final."
"Feb 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"My grandkids, my daughter, and myself (nana) loved this cute take on the beauty of family!
The introduction of the cute little puppy totally made this movie! I was surprised there was a tiny bit of questionable language but not enough to distract from this adorable concept of family."
"Feb 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Dreamworks did such a good job with the VFX in this movie. The characters are pure charm and I just loved the antagonists. Definitely recomend to everyone in all ages!
"Feb 9, 2023",POSITIVE,woah did dreamworks actually just surpass disney?
"Feb 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such an exciting animated feature by DreamWorks. This movie doesn't get the credit that it deserves, but it's definitely nominated for an Oscar. This film is so exciting from beginning to end with action pack scenes, an emotional dialogue. The comedy twist, and the character development is all exciting and lives up to the hype. I highly recommend this film for anybody. Interested in checking out an animated feature on the big screen before it leaves theaters completely."
"Feb 9, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it. Character development was just amazing and the new enemies were great.
"Feb 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Masterpiece. This will go down in history as Shrek
"Feb 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was perfect beautiful and heart warming film I ever watch and part where he said
The legend will never di 🔔 cracks me up must see it with friends or family or your self just watch it! It's great!!!!"
"Feb 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"intricate plot, incredible thematic music throughout, visuals were off the charts"
"Feb 9, 2023",POSITIVE,The best movie of 2023 so far
"Feb 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in boots the last wish was great. This movie isn't a cash grab movie like most movie these days but rather a well thought and balanced animated movie that takes risk. Even for a family friendly movie it welcomes heavy scenes and by that I don't mean light hearted heavy scenes. From the emotional depth of each characters of the story and the best, antagonist I have seen in a long time in an animated movie. I concur this is the best animated movie that have come when it was released and I would say it's even on par with Shrek 2. Personally, this movie is right there with Spiderman: into the spider verse as my favorite I just can't pick which because they're both great lol"
"Feb 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well done animation, with fun dialogues and good soundtrack."
"Feb 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best animated movies I have ever seen, 

I hope more movies will be like this, it genuinely may be one of my favourite movies of all time. I made an account just to review this. No animated movie will be like it for a long time!!!"
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Maravilhoso, uma dos melhores filmes que vi nos ultimos tempos"
"Feb 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,A little too intense for my 6 year old grand daughter
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"For a movie targeted towards kids, it absolutely exceeds expectations. Dealing with themes in mental health, trust, and belonging it's got a great message for all to see!"
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"love, absolutely one of the best animated movies of all times"
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Brilliant movie from the animation, characters and pretty much everything else. The villains is Dreamworks best ever. This is just simply amazing. 95/100"
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Penso che sia adatto a portare un teenager a guardare, ma non sotto di 6 anni. la storia e' molto carina, ma la morte potrbbe fare paura ai bambini molto piccoli."
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"this was my second time watching this movie And I still love it to this day
story got really good if not better
you have three villains with three different morals but two of the same goal
witch makes me love death so much do to him trying to kill puss in boots and try to fulfill his own purpose
Jack Horner is just some guy who went through his Joker ark  cuz some wooden boy named Pinocchio fucked up his life
and Goldie Just wanted a normal family cuz she wants to feel like she fits in and be the sore thumb that sticks out in a bear family.

in finale words 
don't be a greedy ass hole
have your moments with your family
and try to enjoy life while you still can"
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wasnt expecting such a genuine portrayal of a number of themes, must see."
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was such a great movie, most movie sequels are worse then the first ones, but puss in boots the last wish is a better movie then the first movie, everything in this movie is just great it has perfect balance between serious and comedy. Serious issues like anxiety and panic attacks are shown in a serious matter and build the story. The Antagonist of this movie is one of my favorite of all time, without spoiling to much this antagonist really changes the movie and is my favorite character. Many characters go through some great character development like Puss in Boots who has some of the greatest development. You grow to love the characters as the movie goes on. 10/10 please watch it if you can, The animation in this movie is very eye catching and gorgeous as well."
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"After I saw the dogs belly, I need a therapy dog (not that one)"
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Looked like a watercolor movie! It had some of my favorite actors and was decently funny.
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"A kids movie being more mature than an adult series? Ohhh, I LOVE when this happens. Yea, I'm watching you, VELMA (100% pirated)."
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went to see this movie this past Sunday, I went into this movie off the hype I was hearing about from other people, so my expectations were high for the movie which can often only end in disappointment when a movie doesn't live up the the idea of it within your own mind. 

I'm glad to say the movie not only met my expectations but sailed way above them.

The voice acting, sound effects, animation, story and camera angles in every scene were phenomenal; from the most gripping fight scenes to the most heart-warming scenes. To compare I recently also went to see the sequel to Avatar as well and if I was asked to make a choice between the two it would but Puss in Boots without hesitation. 

The characters and story had development and character arcs that I didn't expect to have in a Puss in Boots movie however that only made the movie the more refreshing and gripping. You've got heroes and villains that are incredibly relatable as well as the comically villainous villains which all culminates an incredible finale for the characters and viewer. 

If you've the choice between this and any other movie out right now; pick Puss in Boots."
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,We need more of these well thought out movies and not some cgi crap from marvel!!!
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"This animation style provides a fresh, crisp style, and the script isn't dumbed down for only children. Fantastic villain and hero's journey. Would absolutely see again"
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in boots the last wish is the perfect animated film.
You might think I'm exaggerating because its an animated dreamworks  film about a talking cat in shoes from the shrek universe going on a typical adventure but that's because you aren't looking deeply enough into the film about a talking cat form the shrek universe. Puss in boots is at its core a story about the idea of ""laughing in the face of death"" and coming to terms with our undeniable mortality and a story of living your one (or nine) lives the best you can. It's a story that juggles anxiety and panic attacks paired with the feeling that death is looming around you constantly, waiting to strike. And it's a film about what fear does to you and what it does to your relationship and your life

Puss and boots starts with Puss going on a normal adventure,  throwing a party and then killing a giant. But then he dies. Which he seems completely unfazed by until he realizes he's on his last life. And is prescribed ""retirement."" 

I've never been a fan of the dreamworks art style. Its just never stood out to me. But with Puss In Boots  The Last Wish  I genuinely enjoyed the way they animated it. Their use of the more 2D art style in a mostly 3D animated film was gorgeous and definitely did more than offer a nod to Spider-Man into the spiderverse. It genuinely excites me that one of my favorite animated films, Spider-Man into the spider verse, could be having such an effect on animation and the industry. The animation in Spider-Man into the spiderverse genuinely made me so happy and I thought the scenes were absolutely gorgeous. I've been animating for multiple years now and I've won competitions for my animation and I LOVE animation analysis and both of these movies really stand out to me.

Not only is this movie gorgeous but it's also smart. This movie,as I said, tackles bigger topics and enthralled you with its gorgeous animation but it also appeals to the right audiences. Because of course it's a kids film so kids are going to watch it but who's taking them to the movies? Adults. How do you appeal to adults?"" That's a question the animation industry has been looking at for years. They've tried things such as, more adult jokes, which the shrek universe is famous for. But in the end they just feel like cheap laughs. I took my dad and my sister to see Puss In Boots the first time I watched it and my dad genuinely laughed at parts. He found lots of teh humor amusing such as, The Jiminy cricket sketch and the Goldilocks dynamic. This movie appeals to lots of people and does it well. ANd they have the numbers to prove it."
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,purrfect. I haven't seen it I just remember the original.
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Very funny and creative. Great family movie.
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"A visually stunning film, Puss in Boots is well written and directed (excellent job on the pacing, Joel Crawford). The script is character rich (Perro, Goldilocks and the Bears, Little Jack Horner, Ethical Bug and more) and they are so organically woven in, I couldn't get enough. Bravo of taking on the topic of 'death' in a very kid friendly way. And while the 'wish upon a star' is not new or a fresh take, been done and is more ownable by other franchises, the movie managed a fresh take on the journey through the Black Forest to reach it ...so giving credit where credit is due."
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,The animation is fantastic and is the best animated movie next to Into the SpiderVerse
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"THE WOLF WAS HOT, love him. Also great story."
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a whimsical creature my heart is fluttering
"Feb 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,We were late and the movie theater wouldn't move up our movie time
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun story, great graphics!"
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,melhor filme de 2022/2023. super recomendo
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Who would expect the orange cat from Shrek to maje a movie that hits perfectly right ?
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was perfect, perfect, everything, down to the last of my mutant details"
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Everyone vote puss in boots the last wish in the Oscars or i will come to your house and the fbi will come up to shoot you
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,He's one of my favorite cats.  It was a great movie. He had me cheering for him.
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! This was my second time watching it.
"Feb 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was ok but not great.  The plot is recycled from 1000 other films and paints some other storybook characters as villains.  Not appropriate for younger kids and too thin for older kids and adults.  Kids 10-15 will probably enjoy it.

It does glamorize drInking, stealing, and being fugitives to a degree."
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved everything about the movie and so did my grand Grand daughter
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,10/10 funny cat helped with my existential crisis unironically 10/10 action 10/10 pacing every scene felt like it belonged 10/10 characters some were too real like death is how i imagine death to be 10/10 ending the animation was stellar all around but the ending made me cry at how beautiful animation could be it wasnt even a story beat and it made me cry. went in expecting a cashgrab bleakly animated marketable trope filled hellscape mess but got one of my favorite movies ever. make shrek 5 like this and ill die happy
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a very cute story, very funny and surprisingly scary. Great for the whole family"
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,IT WAS THE BEST PUSS IN BOOTS MOVIE EEEEVVVVVEEERRRRRRR IT HAD ACTION AND ADVENTURE AND KITTY SOFT PAWS and I'm not an zoophile but if I was WOOF WOOF OR SHOULD I SAW MEOW
"Feb 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"You gotta love Puss In Boots - fun family film - take the kids or not - its enjoyable, bring the popcorn."
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,It was everything a movie should be! 10/10 would recommend!!
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun movie that is fit for all ages! Refreshingly new with a touch of nostalgia
"Feb 8, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best animated movies in general with an amazing antagonist. Give this movie your money so we can get more movies that clearly put their heart and soul into animation.
"Feb 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Damn good, love this cat."
"Feb 7, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the 2nd best Shrek movie. it takes a few watches to get all the jokes. it is very much in the style of Spider-man into the spider-verse.
"Feb 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is an adult movie-not a kids movie-ad advertised
"Feb 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun watch and entertaining throughout the movie. 
"Feb 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This has the best animation I have seen in a few years. It has that creative and fun stylization that you expect from animated movie, unlike the over-hyper-realism pixar seems to be going for. Plus, the fight scenes are soo good. Story is also pretty good, it handles a sensitive subject in very mature way, a way that you won't expect in an animation movie. 
In my opinion, the highlight of the movie must be the villain, an absolutely terrifying and death-chilling antagonist."
"Feb 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Villains where hilarious
"Feb 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"The only animated movies that blew me away from the last decade are How to Train Your Dragon, the Croods and How to Train Your Dragon 2 gets an honorary mention. Puss in Boots The Last Wish is the first in this decade's list. Hope DreamWorks keeps making more like this"
"Feb 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Puss in boots: the last wish tells a mature story about death and acceptance. The comedy is very enjoyable and doesn't leave a dry taste in your mouth. All i have to say to dream works is surprise me! I look forward to the future.
"Feb 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Easily the best movie of the decade
"Feb 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a masterpiece. Everything about it is perfect - the story, the characters, the animation, the sound design, even the pacing. It's an absolute pleasure to watch and I recommend it to everyone.
The story is great, despite being an animated movie deeply connected to ones made previously for children, it doesn't sway from tackling more deep and challenging problems. The main characters go through a lot in this movie and it is reflected by their behaviour.
The sound design is immaculate, certain sound cues being played at perfect times to signal danger, fear, or comfort. It is perfect to the point of the whistling one character does becoming very iconic, and every time it appears you know they are near.
The animation is top notch, workers at DreamWorks clearly putting in a lot of effort to create the best in a long time. Characters move through the environment clearly, interacting with it as they go, making us feel like they really are there instead of just being pasted in later. The animation is fluid, so when an enemy moves with less frames per second you can tell they are dangerous and clunky, and when later the same animation style is done to the main character while escaping you know they are the ones in danger. The animators doing little tricks like the one previously mentioned shows just how skilled they are in the art.
The characters are all memorable, each one's personality being very defined and different from the other's. This leads to some conflicts but also is a nice way for them to interact without it feeling forced. The new additions to the cast - the little dog, the main villain and others don't feel shoe horned in, instead feeling simply like extensions of the world we just haven't seen before.
This movie was masterfully done in all aspects, and I cannot recommend it enough to everyone. You should most definitely watch it or you'll miss out on one of the most amazing movies I've seen in a while."
"Feb 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"I am a 23 year old man and this 'children's' animated movie has become my favourite film of all time. It is perfect in every aspect, story, characters, pace, dialogue, animation, sound track, all of them 10/10. I can genuinely think of no faults to this film and it is one that can be thoroughly enjoyed by all ages, perfectly balancing light hearted comedy with some deeper themes and important life questions and messages . I will be going back to see it on the cinema screen several times before it leaves theatres and I will be bringing as many family and friends as I can because it is just that amazing!"
"Feb 7, 2023",POSITIVE,it was absolutely brillaint best animated movie of the century the animation was great the villain/ characters were amazing the plot was good nothing bad about it its soo enjoyable 10/10 easily
"Feb 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Have to admit this is actually better then the first love the animation fight scenes are perfect and the style they use for it it the story was great very funny even with some adult themes that are blurred out over all really good movie
"Feb 7, 2023",POSITIVE,know this is what I call a MOVIE. thanks dream work for this masterpiece!
"Feb 7, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the characters!
"Feb 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Going in I had low expectations because I did not love the first Puss In Boots, but this movie blew me away. It was funny, heart warming, and overall the story had such amazing themes. The animation was also phenomenal and all of the voice actors gave a great performance."
"Feb 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was good, especially the story"
"Feb 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie ever made, (certainly better than the new Avatar movie). I loved the morale of the movie, the animation was also spectacular, the low fps, bright animation just ties all together so well. The villain / protagonists were all written so well, while Death was just doing his job. Jack Horner was pure evil. This was such a good movie and Dreamworks didn't dissapoint."
"Feb 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Top 3 movies I have ever seen it's sooo good
"Feb 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie.Great story, love all characters.La mejor!!!"
"Feb 7, 2023",POSITIVE,It had a very interesting twist.
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"awesome, loved the movie and the ending scene? daaamn, that means something?? :O :D"
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Great family movie. Enjoyed it with my fiancée.
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have always been a big animation fan, I grew up with Shrek franchise. But honestly, i didn't expect anyting special from the movie, cause the Dreamworks studio and animation having not the best years. HOW WRONG WAS I !!! After absolutelly horrible movies about boss baby, Dreamworks ressurected with amazing Puss in boots. For example,I exspected Perrito to be a regular dumb comic relief and I was wrong again! It's a very good character who makes sense for the plot and other characters evolution. The villians - BASE! Both Jack Horner and Wolf catch the eye, it was so brave to do that serious villians, I respect that. The animation, the music, the drama, side characterrs, locations designs, jokes, Shrek and farytales references - I noticed that all, and all authors hard work. Dreamorks is back on track and ready to meet Disney on the animation battlefield again, like back in early 2000s. They have already gave a lesson how to do an amazing family movie withot trying to follow all fashionable trends."
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie! Every character is lovable, the jokes made me audibly laugh and the villain's in the story are some of DreamWorks best (Death will always be my favorite character in this movie). The visuals are nice with the comic book look and give the backgrounds a nice pop of color."
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Obra Prima, que filme foda cara"
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was absolutely incredible! It has a very good message about the value of life and some of the best villains/antagonists I have seen. The significant characters had a captivating screen presence and were all so much fun. In addition to that, It portrays anxiety in a realistic way when it shows Puss having a panic attack. The visuals were a stunning mix of 3D animation, watercolor, and that Spiderverse-ey style.

As far as story goes, it serves its purpose of humbling Puss and develops his character in a believable way while still keeping him as the same lovable feline.

I admit, I initially thought Perrito would have been the stereotypical annoying Kevin Hart side character, but I couldn't have been more wrong. He was surprisingly lovable and endearing. He even helped Puss through a panic attack in the same way REAL therapy dogs do. 

Jack Horner was absolutely hilarious, Goldilocks and the three bears were surprisingly wholesome, and Death filled me with pants-shitting fear every time I heard his whistle.

Puss in Boots: the Last Wish is altogether an incredible movie, 100% a must watch."
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Hero's Journey is an absolute timeless classic. Puss in Boots manages to frame that perfectly into it's own theme while developing side characters just as well.
I didn't expect such a good movie.
The visuals are a blast, steering away from realism and turning into a colorful anime/comic-book action style."
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"When I first heard that Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is coming out I did not expect to like the movie so much. At some moments of the movie I was sobbing and at some I could not stop laughing, It was a roller coaster of emotions. This movie is for ALL ages, me and my whole family watched it all together and we all loved it. The movie was so witty and funny. The animation was elegant yet so smooth.

The movie had so many characters which most of you already know from your childhood like Goldilocks and the three bears, Little Jack Horner, Big Bad Wolf which in this movie he was represented as ""Death."" Even though you think you know these characters in this movie but there, their story was explained more and they acted more different then what you would think, I would like to explain how but that would be like a spoiler. I would rate it 10/10
It was Purrrfect. :)"
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Beyond mind blowingly amazing and fantastic. Truly Oscar worthy by far. Probably my best animation movie of all time. Shocked and suprised in the best way. This movie is going to get every award. Wish I could give it 10 stars. Beyond worth it to watch. Love this movie to bits
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"A beautiful movie, my kids loved it. Great plot, charismatic characters, a very well written story.
The people who made Disney's Pinocchio should watch it 20 times to learn how to make a worthy film today."
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Movie of 2022, even beats The Batman in my opinion. 

Must watch."
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,It's the best movie I saw the last 4 years and it's a amazing idk what to say else 10/10
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very funny and family oriented. With a very good message and very good performances. a great, great animated movie for kids and adults."
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was amazing, great story and plot, and a W for him showing emotions and having a panic attack! Love it and everyone went ""awww"" once he showed his face on the big screen. Amazing animation. Movie deserves awards"
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is an absolute fantastic movie! Beautiful art stlye mixes und super awesome villains! A perfect movie with a perfect villain - The Wolf.
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"esse filme é pedrada!, bom demais!!!"
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Recomendado 10/10 es cine.
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"На мой взгляд, это лучший анимационный фильм снятый за последнее время, в нем незамысловатый сюжет (движение из пункта а в пункт б), простой злодей который злой сам по себе, однако этому мультфильму не нужны эти сюжетные осложнения, ведь в это не было целью создателей, этот мультфильм раскрывает нам кота в сапогах не как неустрашимого безупречного героя, а как простое самовлюблённое и эгоистичное существо, которое изо всех сил пытается оттянуть собственную кончину и избежать смерти, однако на этом пути он изменяется и понимает, что конца не избежать и необходимо жить здесь и сейчас и дорожить тем что имеешь. По итогу могу сказать, что если этот мультипликационный фильм нельзя назвать не побоюсь этого слова шедевром, то мало какое произведение может претендовать на это звание."
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is the best movie I've ever seen, I am disappointed with it only having 95 on the tomatometer, it deserves more, but 95% is still high.
Anyways, let's get in topic.
In this review, we will have 7 categories to cover and rate.
Characters: The characters are a sweet and pure 10/10, their backstories are very creative with goldilocks, perrito and jack horner, and the characters don't make you feel like they are just added in because the studio can, it makes you feel that every characters have their main purpose of being in the show, every character is just a puzzle piece in this movie.
Casting: The cast for the movie is gold, 9/10! John Mulaney fits the role for jack horner, and Death sounds so good! every character feels like if the animation speaks without any person voicing it! mouse syncing is very good too!
Villains: 11/10, no explanation here, Wait no, 11+/10 it's not gold IT'S DIAMOND!
Animation: Animation is SUPER GOOD! like how they use a similar style with one of the best movies out there, Spiderman into the spiderverse! but instead of making the visuality looks like a comic book, they made the visuality looks like a fairy tale book, it looks so bright and actually give that art made out of paint/ fairy tale book vibe!
Plot: 12+/10, the plot is what brings together this magnificent movie, so no explanation same for the villain!
Action: 100/10 this is like an anime type of combat/fighting, fast paced, effects that is more likely to make you watch every single part of the scene and sounds in those scene are so satisfying!
Soundtrack: 8/10 fearless hero is a banger, my favorite out of the bunch is horner heist, no context."
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Literally perfection
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best masterpieces ever created ngl, only negative is that its more for adults than kids :D"
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was fantastic, the visuals, the action, the character, the plot and script, this movie talks about fear and it's depressed but it still be a kids movie."
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Genuinely one of the greatest movies of this generation the writing was amazing the animation and the voice acting was beautiful .the writing wasn't scared to get ""dark"" for a Pg movie genuinely feels good animation is coming back compared to what we had recently. Overall its a must watch"
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"BRO WHEN I SAY THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WATCHING I MEAN IT. ITS GOD TIER ITS AMAZING. ITS ABOUT A SILLY CAT WHO IS SCARED OF DYING AND HAS TO GET OVER THEIR HUGE EGO. THE THOUGHT PROCESS PUT INTO THIS MOVIE WAS NEVER ENDING AND I CANT STOP THINKING ABT IT. THE 3 MAIN CHARACTERS ALL FOCUS ON ONE ASPECT OF TIME. THE MC CAT, PUSS, WORRIES ABT HIS FUTURE AND HOW WILL HE CONTINUE LIFE IF HE CAN NO LONGER BE RECKLESS. THE SECOND CAT, KITTY, FOCUSES ON THE PAST AS SHE STRUGGLES TO TRUST ANYONE FROM WHAT HAPPENED IN HER PAST. AND PERRITO, THE DOG, FOCUSES ON THE PRESENT AS HE BELIEVES HE SHOULD CHERISH ANYTHING HE IS GIVEN. AND DONT GET ME STARTED ON THE ANIMATION AND CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. OHH AND HOW COULD I GORGET THE GREATEST SONGS MADE OF LATE 2022?! WHO IS YOUR FAVORITE FEARLESS HERO?! 💯🗣🤺"
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was amazing. The writers gave us a beautiful fusion of childrens stories with some more mature elements to it for older viewers. Messages of the inevitably of death, wishes, pride and so many more were tackled here, and my only complaint is that it wasnt longer.

For sensitive parents, there are two moments where blood is shown on screen, but they are very brief and the equivalent of a paper cut."
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't write reviews a lot, but for this one it was so great, I just had too!! The plot line, the charcter development. Everything was just amazing!!! I 100% recommend. The movie was super deep aswell!! The way they portrayed the fear and anxiety with puss and boots was phenomenal!!! The charcters are so well written. The whole goldy locks and the three bears concept was just so amazing!! It was so unique!
The whole movie was absolutely beautiful!!! Between the storyline and the charcters the movie had me smiling, laughing and even cry with how wholesome some parts were. 
Not only was this animated movie able to convey a good story but it was also able to convey a good moral and real life issues, such as anxiety. 10000% loved it!!
100000% recommend."
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,The story the humor the animation
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another family friendly feline flick. A story of family, friends, and the ideal value one should place on what is truly important in their lives. My 10 year old loved being familiar with all the characters and their individual stories. Some tear jerker moments, a lot of good chuckle moments too. The animation reminded me of the movies before but they seemed to have implemented a sort of comic book-esque style of animation as well. If you're familiar with the animated Spider-Man, that's where it felt like it was pulled from."
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow. Okay, a kids movie about a cat with boots was not one I expected to hit every single mark I have in order for a movie to be considered ""great."" 

And yet, here I am.

Everything about this movie is really phenomenal. I wasn't going to go see it, but heard good things and thought, ""well, I haven't been to the theaters in a while. Why not?"" So glad I did. I will be going again. The storytelling is literally PERFECT (or puurfect? ...sorry). It doesn't treat the audience as stupid, everything just flows so perfectly, and there's no lecture telling us what the moral of the story is--instead, the movie trusts in its own ability to tell a story. The villain/s are fun and interesting. The humor actually lands. I actually cried. Who knew an animated movie about a cat would bring me to tears?

This movie hits home on so many levels, addressing so many raw, human fears that are incredibly relatable. It has a good moral, and good sub-morals. And it's fun. It's so much fun to watch. Highly recommend. I'll definitely be buying this on DVD when it comes out."
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie this year so far, amazing animation and story line, also I liked the characters as they were all well made with proper backgrounds and fitting voice actors, great job dreamworks"
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it, couldn’t have been better!"
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved this movie! Funny, entertaining and with a few lessons for children and adults. We must stay humble, be grateful for what we have and appreciate the people in our lives. Happiness is a life well lived!"
"Feb 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,Nice animation and a couple of good laughs. Main story aim a little random but then it is a fairytale!
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a cute movie! Very well written storyline. I mean, it is Puss in Boots!"
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"A sequel to a bland spin-off has no right being this GREAT! 
Puss In Boots: The Last Wish has plenty of heart, colour and charisma that's brought to life not only from it's visuals (that are quite simply fantastic) but from a passionate voice cast that oozes energy. Vapid and superbly edited action scenes that carefully utilise it's Spider-Verse style swagger at the right moments. Humour that hits more than it misses. Satisfying story arcs and Emotional beats. AND all of this is seasoned with a delightfully mature approach towards it's themes, proving yet again that the best ‘kids' films are the one's that – much like it's terrifically scary villain - aren't afraid to get a little dark."
"Feb 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,Horrible!!!!! Not a pixar quality film
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,This is literally the best film of the last 5 years. No Question.
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,just watch it trust me
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,animação divertida e gostosa de assistir ver o gato passando por crise de ansiedade e aprendendo o valor dde ter apensa uam vida é uma baita lição de moral e o lobo como vilão incrivel
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Very funny and has a really good story
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, great jokes, great new villains, even got something in my eye. Animation is excellent esp during fights when it takes on a more hand drawn look."
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Family loved it! Definitely fun, cute and funny."
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I like the way that the three bears and Goldilocks, both cats and the dog all got their wishes without even having to make those wishes. It shows if you’ve got a good heart, it will come shining through and the movie did that in a wonderful way that leaves you feeling happy at the end. The message that the movie gives is really sweet and good for all ages alike."
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,PUSS IN BOOTS >>> AVATAR 2
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"A melhor coisa áudio visual que eu já vi, simplesmente uma obra prima."
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was fun laughed alot and was just stunning id go again
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,10/10 very great movie
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was a good family movie.
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme muito bom, engraçado, emocionante, que te prende na história, o vilão e foda"
"Feb 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,I thought it was a kid friendly movie. Not really probably need to be 10+. I dont know why it need to be so dark of a film seemed very unnecessary.
"Feb 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,Story was good. Larger guy was kind of weird.
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I absolutely loved this movie! I am a huge fan of Puss in boots and this movie completely did him justice. I love the character development we have and can’t wait to see more of him.
"Feb 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great movie for my grandkids
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"we all loved it kids and adults, really sweet movie."
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"An excellent addition to the Shrek Cinematic Universe which weaves the ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" animation style into its action sequences. Choosing to develop Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the three bears helped to contrast all of the families and their unique dynamics."
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,loved Goldilocks in the movie.
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was amazing, the art style, the comedy, the story's pacing, loved it all."
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have seen this movie four times, twice in theaters and twice at home, and even after seeing it this many times, it never gets stale. Each scene of this movie is crafted wonderfully, with each character serving their purpose perfectly, and even the fact that this movie still makes me laugh to this day, that really says something. This is now my favorite movie ever. A movie filled with action and themes that are both for kids and adults. Highly recommend watching this to incentivize DreamWorks to make more of these films."
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun wonderful movie, and I'm a grownup"
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining. Animation could’ve been better. Plot was a little silly. 
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,haha funni funni big back borner
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film is brilliant.
It completely captured the Shrek vibes and executed it even better than the first one.
The animation is gorgeous, characters amazing, good writing, music is beautiful and the jokes capture the goofy lil Shrek vibe I love.

I was also in tears multiple times and the ending and prologue are so hype holy shit."
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was awesome! I would recommend it!
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Great storyline! Very choice funny moments. My daughter and I enjoyed it immensely!
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"An absolute must see movie, I am normally not a massive fan of animated movies, but this is excellent from start to finish. Funny & great little story too."
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic! Worth multiple rewatches, characters are all so dynamic!"
"Feb 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was a vacuous shell of a move lacking everything that that made the first one so endearing, what a stinker!
Watching the beginning song and dance sequence that introduces the newly animated look of puss, I was dismayed at the cheap looking slapstick action lacking any of the charm that oozed from all the characters in the original that had incredibly detailed expressions.  It set the tone for the whole rest of the movie.  All the clever humour and emotion that appealed just as much to the adult audience was gone and replaced by Hanna-Barbera type cartoony action.  Maybe mildly entertaining only for kids below the age of 7.  Also without meaning to sound ageist, Banderas and Hayek's voices were simply too old and croaky to be fitting for the characters, unfortunately sounded more suitable for grandad/grandma type characters."
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,awesome movie with fun characters and absolutely stunning visuals!!
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining. A great written sequel for both kids and parents
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing family movie. Halarious and was overall such a fab film!!
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"It doesn't matter how old we get moves like this are always worth it. Great sequel, loved it."
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,this was so cute! loved it!
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I like everything. 
Cool story.Well done!"
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,One of my favourite animated movies of this year great experience the fights the action puss himself a goat the soundtrack. death as a villain and his haunting signature whistle all the characters are so sick if you've seen movie clips online and people tell you it's amazing take there word and go watch it
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Considering how terrible the first puss and boots was, I was beyond skeptical that this was going to be just another bad animated action movie. boy was i wrong.

this movie was a wonderfully crafted masterpiece. dream works out did themselves by finally making the puss and boots movie many early 2000s viewers of Shrek 2 have been wanting to see since the introduction of puss. 
the movies story was incredibly thought out and had so much genuine character something the first film lacked. speaking of characters every single character was amazing going back to the twisted fairy tales we have seen all the way back with the first Shrek. each character was well thought out from Goldie and the 3 bears to jack hawner each one was fine crafted. i must personally say though that there was a definite outlier. Death. every single time he was on the screen he stole the show. from the design to backstory and his signature eyrie whistle the designers knew exactly what they were doing by making Death as bad ass as he is. 

the story and characters all though excellent would not have been as marvelous if the animators stuck to the original Shrek style. instead, they overhauled it and went with a much more spider verse style which perfectly complemented the story and action to a tee. i love that the company understood what made the last puss in boots movie so flawed and set out to make perhaps one of what must be the pinacol of animated movies up there with the likes of how to train your dragon and toystory. everyone i went to watch this with was talking about the animation and characters for hours after our first watch and i personally can not wait to watch it again as well as draw some fan art for this movie 

Dreamworks pride yourself on a movie made perfectly and please keep up the top work. additionally if i could give you a higher score i dam well would."
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was an amazing watch! Good animation, amazing character development,  animation,villains, jokes ect. 
anything good I can think of saying about this can be said"
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Who is your favorite fearless hero?
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie. We took our Grandkids and we all enjoyed it
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Great for kids and adults
"Feb 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Better than I thought it was going to be (which was also true of that other cat movie sequel).

Perhaps it's the calibre of the acting talent providing the voices, with Salma Hayek and Olivia Coleman co-starring with the returning Antonio Banderas.

Those who are allergic to there always being a moral to these stories should be warned that the multiple morals for Puss in Boots and his fellow travellers on the ""grandest quest yet"" are all banal, mawkish, and forgettable."
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was a Masterpiece, the Visuals are beautiful, the storytelling is top tier, the characters are very cool, a must see"
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was really funny, romantic! Great movie the girls loved it!"
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,The most accurate description of anxiety and mortality in a kid's movie.
"Feb 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's not a kid's movie, it's more for adults, it contains some inappropriate language"
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible movie. I was blown away when I saw this. Every small detail in the movie is incredible and the animations are very fluid and smooth while the voice acting is just as good. The plot is really well crafted and the movie overall was pretty good. Truly a masterpiece.
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie 10/10 no need to describe
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I love how it has three types of villains. Redeemable: Goldilocks. Irredeemable: Jack Horner. and just doing it's job: Death.
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is the greatest movie I’ve seen in a while. I throughly enjoyed watching it. You could call this movie peak and boots because of how much this is peaking rn literally no cap this movie almost made me go crazy.
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"words cannot describe it, but W"
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie is awesome hope they continue with how the ended with far far away
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"My favorite film of the entire 2022 and there were lots of amazing films. The art feels revolutionary, the themes are mature and the writing treats the audience with respect. The comedy lands most every time and it is clear the movie was made with tons of passion for the project itself. This is the best dreamworks film in a decade to give you an idea of how good this movie is."
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie. The animation is absolutely beautiful. The story is also really good and interesting. The writing is really good. But the best part is the villans.
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"every time I looked over at my kid's face, I saw a smile. the movie is a delight from end to end."
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Hilarious! Great movie for the whole family!
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es una película que lo tiene todo, acción comedia, es emocionante la animación es perfecta, totalmente recomendable"
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"At first the movie seemed too childish for my liking. Yes, I know it is a kids movie but still. I had heard the movie would talk about some very mature topics and to my surprise by the end it did! The movie touched on things like overcoming fear, appreciating the family you are given, and being proud of who you are. I was more than impressed by the end and advise many to check this movie out."
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was pretty awesome! Thought I was just going to sleepwalk through it with the kids but I think I enjoyed it it as much as they did!
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing, makes me feel chills"
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"We took the grandkids, ages 6 to 14 and they all loved it!"
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Overall a great movie.
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"8.7/10
……………………………………………."
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Really sweet and entertaining.
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was not only the best in all the puss in boots movies, but arguably one of the best movies in the last 5 years overall. It is a classic redemption arch type movie filled with lots of action, spectacular music, and relatable and memorable characters. The morals taught in the movie are also incredibly inspiring. But the best part of the movie would be the 'villain' Death, who reminds Puss and the viewers of the importance of living a life not to the fullest, but instead live a life of true meaning. 10/10. Already planning on watching again."
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a dad, I actually enjoyed this movie. Probably laughed more than my kids."
"Feb 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,Very funny and adorable
"Feb 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"After more than a decade, DreamWorks has finally rewarded us with the long-awaited sequel of puss in boots. 

They have done so in such an amazing way with a blend of lovable, remarkable and well-made characters, an incredible story with a thought-provoking plot about life and, of course, a spectacular animation with attention to details that make it continually dazzling to watch.

Overall, for all lovers of animation this stunning movie is a must-see and I can't recommend it enough."
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,My kids a 9 and a 6 year old loved it
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun twist of all stories with the elements needed for a great Dreamworks movie!
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,oh my goodness! it's just as good as the first one. great movie 10/10.
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"The animation, the fights choreography, the characters arcs; it was great, I must impress!"
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,The animation of this movie is next level
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"It would be a shame to Talk about the movie because No words can really express how good This movie is. Dark but humorous, serious with bright Moments. It would be a shame to Not watch This movie. 

Better than Shrek, sorry lads."
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I cried over a digital cat movie. I STRONGLY encourage anyone reading this to watch the movie. This is legitimately the best movie I think I have ever seen.
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was genuinely amazing. The animation was breathtaking, I didn't look at my phone once during watching. It made me cry a little too."
"Feb 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"While the first Puss in boots was funny, this is extremely violent and frightening. Had to leave the theater at the request of my child (7), who states that one of her favorite movies is the first PiB. The wolf is psychotic and the other villains are well beyond PG. see this movie with children only if you want to desensitize them and purge them of innocence."
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Great nicely paced movie. Great villain great hero and overall great story with a good ending.
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a family we absolutely loved this film.  The animation was stunning, great story and it's very funny."
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love this movie! It’s a sequel to an excellent film that I haven’t seen in years, but it’s fantastic in its own right. I can’t recommend it enough."
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was incredible. The animation was breathtaking, the voice acting was on point, it was fast-paced, the action was so well done. It has one of the best movie villains ever, and definitely earned its PG rating."
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,definitely the best comeback that dreamworks could have had.
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked this better than any movie I‘ve seen before. Will watch again. Will tell all my friends.
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ótimos personagens. Protagonista faz sua jornada em busca de amadurecimento e com isso faz uma bela história. E vilão que dá medo, que é implacável e nos deixa tenso; são os melhores."
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a good movie with a good story and great fights. I love the 15 frames fights it just made the movie so much better
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie incredible characters a pretty good story and possibly one of the best animated villains of all time
"Feb 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,Didn't live up to my expectations...so many years of waiting for nothing :(
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was phenomenal!!! The animation was outstanding, not only that but the character development of our little hero was absolutely brilliant and I love it so much!"
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,i saw this in movie theaters and i went out shaking. THAT MOVIE SHOULD BE 100% ON ROTTEN TOMATOES
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,So good I created a rotten tomatoes account just to rate it!
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,o filme é muito bom mudou totalmente o tipo de filme e faz a gente pensar muito sobre a vida
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Not as funny as expected
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely charming, fantastically lovely character designs, Does not hate the audience but instead remains charming and entertaining towards them. Using the spiderverse style of animation added to it without a doubt, lovely voice acting but above all super wonderful coriography for all the moves and action, just a genuine pleasure to get to honestly and sincerely enjoy something good."
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is definitely my favorite animated film at the moment. The artstyle and animation is captivating and brilliant, Death as a villain is menacing and well done, and the story is fast paced but easy to follow. I highly recommend The Last Wish."
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a good movie, what else is there to say"
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Animation in this movie is absolutely beautiful. Storytelling is good and there is nothing boring because the film is not that long.Characters in the movie was played so good and everybody was diffrent in charakter.
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"i went in with high hopes, and i must say this movie was everything i expected and more"
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,It exceeded all of my expectations
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Great best movie this year so far!!!
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,puss in boots the last wish is the best dreamworks movie of all time
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"The perfect animated film - exciting storyline, comic relief character who isn't completely annoying, and great action scenes - all with incredible animation and humour."
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie made sure to establish, expand on, and conclude each significant character throughout the film very well. I could greatly tell that a lot of love went into this sequel, because the story was very rich and found its soul, I suppose in a metaphorical way. Very rewatchable due to that heartfelt and powerful feeling and message it delivered well. Best film I've seen in a looong time."
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, brought me to tears multiple times. Highly recommend"
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"brought back what animation was about, beautiful movie one of my all time favorites."
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"went and saw this movie with my friend yesterday after hearing about how good it was on social media. it absolutely lived up to the expectations and i would even say it blew past them; some of the most realistic depictions of mental health for an animated kids' film, with compelling characters and stunning art. i thoroughly enjoyed it and will hopefully be seeing it in cinemas again with a different friend. i speak some spanish and loved being able to understand what was said when they switched languages, it helped make the film even more immersive for me, and the one-liners from Death in spanish were so much more chilling because i could understand them.
(plus the wolf was hot. always a bonus)

all in all, absolutely a movie i would recommend, and definitely one i will be talking about for quite a while"
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,As a family we loved it 
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"With 2022 bringing many mediocre movies to the table, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish left 2022 with a bang!

From being just an off shoot from the Shrek Franchise, this movie really lives up to the legendary name of Puss in Boots. The 2011 film being just a meh movie of Puss in Boots really didn't feel remarkable in any way, but The Last Wish? This is what makes movies so great to watch!

 Such a simple plot to follow accompanied with such rich and dynamic characters and relationships really keeps you to wanting to see more of these characters interacting and talking. 

Not a single character felt underutilized. Even the characters that didn't have much screen time had their role fulfilled. The story had such maturity with several difficult topics to tackle for a PG film. They absolutely handled them correctly and almost perfectly. Humour is definitely a strength of this movie, with a broad range of jokes from such different characters."
"Feb 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,So the animation was good and the antagonist (death) was actually really good. It's just that the plot and story was kind of lacking
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, if you liked shrek as a kid youll love this"
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Blew my expectations out of the water. Fight choreography and animation is amazing. Story is great too, emotional and funny. Had such a good time in the theater. Great watch for adults and kids in my opinion."
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,My son and I loved it!
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,loved the movie 🎬 must see
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall a solid movie, beutifully animated, doesn't lose it's charm for even a second. I definitely recommend it."
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Is it a children's movie? Yes. Does it contain bleeps over what would otherwise be vulgar language? Yes. However, it only adds to the comedy in my opinion. It has its dramatic moments. The way it shows a fearless hero having a panic attack gave me representation on the screen that I never thought would be possible. Not only that, but the villain is one of Dreamworks' better villains. I would say that this villain is on par with the Fairy Godmother from Shrek 2. Not to mention the artistry and creative choices they made with the animation and the lighting effects were phenomenal! I will always recommend this movie to those that adore the Shrek franchise"
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Cute movie. Lots of action.
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Must see! This is a classic in the works.
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was really good! I was worried it was going to be a waste of time, but it was actually a fantastic movie! Definitely a keeper!"
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"An incredible movie that surpassed my expectations and had me smiling the whole time, would watch again."
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was great but the seats themselves were terribly uncomfortable.
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked that there was content for viewers of all ages and the story was beautiful.
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was a great movie from beginning to end, will recommend everyone to watch this, this is a movie for the entire family"
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie for adults and kids. Good music and 
 graphics. Will watch it again!"
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"As far as a kids movie goes, this was pretty good! It kept my attention, and the kiddo liked the action a lot. They had some good jokes for adults, and it had a nice heartfelt story. The animation was INCREDIBLE!"
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Peak fiction. Just... peak fiction
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Yes, I am still here. ;)"
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Might be the greatest movie of all time. The wolf is terrifying and I had nightmares for weeks. All around and awesome movie. I will watch it for the rest of my life. The dog is a great side character that adds humor and sadness to the movie. The other villains are really good and bring a lot of action and emotion to the film. Puss's relationship with soft paws is very good and was displayed very well.
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. I’ve waited too long for another Puss movie
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie legit made me cry at the end the story was masterfully crafted
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Showed what was really important in life. Family!
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely brilliant film, I absolutely loved it (I'm 24) and my neice (5) and nephew (9) equally loved it. Would definitely recommend for all ages, especially if you like these types of films ❤️"
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"The trailer left that feeling that it would be good, but it was better in all aspects compared to the first one, which I don't even remember how ""marking"" it was.
I loved what they did to one of the antagonists and how he affects the cat. Most of the jokes work (it's a shame they show the montage of lives in the trailers), the arcs are well divided, the characters' goal, I can say that Spiderverse had its share of influence in the animation, which is beautiful.
The team has a lot of work ahead of them if they want to make one more, and the cat is an excellent character who deserves the challenge.
You can watch it, it's really worth it !"
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Kids will love it especially my kids.
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is my favourite movie for now. I was on it 2 times, and for sure I'll go again. This animation looks easier than from the last parts, but even better and prettier idk why lol. Its weird, it never happend to me. Like I always don't like much the female company with the main male characters, but now I literaly LoVe Kitty SoftPaws too and Perrito of course. Even the Villain Death Wolf. Well I don't think, that Death is a Villain, he's just doing his job.. that's all. The Villain of this move Wich I hate is Jack Horner. I don't hate him just for nothing. It was made by DreamWork to make us hate him Wich is Incredible made.❤️‍🔥 wow..."
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,it was a really good movie
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I can't stop watching it. It's too good lol
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie should of been overstuffed but somehow they juggle everything to make what is a near perfect 80s movie, and what i mean by 80s is that its way scarier than a modern family film, with themes and tones that do not treat kids as stupid. Amazing movie that stands alone from the Shrek franchise, and easily the best since Shrek 2."
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hands down one of the best animation movies I've ever watched. Not going to lie, I had to stop twice as it made me cry. Perrito, the dog character, is so beautifully written it's amazing how you can sense the pain through his innocence (any person who has a dog can see the innocence in him). I found myself laughing out-loud right after having cried, and there are very very few movies out there that can do that to you. 

The new anime-inspired fight scenes add beautifully to the overall artistic rendition, and the writing is just top-notch. Nothing to say about the voice-acting. From Banderas to Moura and Hayek, it's just perfect. 
 
I don't give reviews often, but it is an absolute must-watch (watching the first movie helps keep track of the story, so it's also recommended.) 10/10"
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"WHO IS FAVOURITE FEARLESS HEEEEEEEEEERO

10/10 first movie to earn one pussyllion dollars at the boxoffice"
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is literally my favorite movie now. I'm not exaggerating. I have gone to see it four times. Please, for the love of movies, watch this movie."
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Shrek franchise is back 

Here is my review of Puss in Boots The Last Wish 
https://youtu.be/311CXtRBD0M"
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,best film I've seen in years
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best animated movies ever.
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"De las mejores películas de dreamworks que he visto, buen mensaje, buena historia y entretenida, ademas muy profunda, sin duda oro fenómeno de las maravillosas secuelas de dreamworks"
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than the first movie
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,It was awesome! My childhood favorite movie got an amazing sequel and it was all I could ever ask for my favorite ship before I knew what shipping was!^^
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is SO GODDAMN AMAZING I CANT EVEN BEGIN TO EXPLAIN HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS MOVIE ITS SO GOOD.
I usually am a HUGE CRITIC when it comes to animated films nowadays but OH MY GOD. This gave me that feel I haven't felt when watching a movie IN A DECADE!
Anyone who dislikes this movie has either not watched it, doesn't like shrek, looking for excuses or just OUTRIGHT STUPID. This movie has so many characters and yet it manages to hold them into a 2 hour story without making it feel like it is forced or shoving it down your throat. NOT EVEN GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW AMAZING THE MAIN ANTAGONIST FOR THIS MOVIE IS, HE IS THE BEST GODDAMN ''VILLAIN'' I'VE SEEN SINCE FOREVER! I LOVE THIS MOVIE I WOULD RATE IT A MILLION STARS, I WOULD SELL MY LIMBS FOR THIS MOVIE... THIS MOVIE IS MY LIFE, MY SOUL AND MY BODY COMBINED. HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU WATCH THIS AND GIVE IT A 5 STAR RATING! <3333333"
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was a surprise, we went as a family and we all had a good time. Hopefully they'll keep up the good work!"

DreamWorks made this movie a masterpiece"
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great characters, story, animation!"
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed this film. I probably wasn't going to watch it until I read the reviews and how great it was and how it was up there with the original Shrek movies. I enjoyed the journey it took us with Puss and Boots. I was also a fan of ‘The Big Bad Wolf' as the antagonist. Gave this film a 9.0 out of 10.
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Extremely good script and dubbing, in addition to a very beautiful animation. I felt something I haven't felt in years watching this movie. 10 out of 10!"

"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sem dúvida alguma que esse é o melhor filme de toda a franquia, que exalta uma animação impecável com uma paleta de cores incrível. Um contexto firme que explora muito bem a história interligada de seus personagens e que entrega tudo o que promete do começo ao fim. Gato de botas 2 é sem sombra de dúvida o melhor filme de animação que já vi."
"Feb 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely amazing movie. It is a MUST see
"Feb 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"un film incroyable, qui traite de la mort, a quel point la vie est precieuse, une morale qui saura inspirer les spectateurs de tout age, un rythme tres bon, je ne me suis pas ennuyé une seule seconde alors que j'ai même pas vu le film."
"Feb 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Dreamworks movie since Shrek 2 and How to Train Your Dragon 1-3 combined
"Feb 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,It seemed short but it was a good movie overall
"Feb 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just take my Money already.
Puss in Boots is a fantastic Animation full of fun, whit and heart warming moments, whether you watch it by yourself or with the family, this movie won't let you Down."
"Feb 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"When I saw there would be a sequel to the first film I wasn't very excited. The first film was good but nothing really that would make it an instant classic. It is somewhat similar with The Last Wish, with a slight difference - the writing, art style and characters were briliant, the humor was great and overall the I can really say that it is a must watch, not really an instant classic but a very good film overall."
"Feb 2, 2023",POSITIVE,who must have a third movie PUSS please its to good and goofy make another please or at least      a cameo in Shrek 6 make it please.
"Feb 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"In love with this movie. I grew up with the Shrek universe, and Puss was always my favorite. I've been waiting for another movie since the first in 2011. I loved the characters, Jack Horner was genuinely one of the funniest villains I've seen in a bit. The only complaint I have is with the comic book style of animation, and the fact it was only used during high-action scenes. I never thought that style looked good to begin with, but having it exclusively in moments with actions just makes it look like a game that's lagging because the computer's hardware can't keep up."
"Feb 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful animation, the villians are great, the story is amazing, and the characters are very well write. Comoletely recomended"
"Feb 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hands down the BEST movie I've seen in a loooong time. Amazing story, great voice acting, well written and well rounded characters, a great creepy villain, AND good music. I was not expecting to be that entertained from beginning to end. I already can't wait to watch it again! Thank you for making a movie that just wanted to entertain us!"

"Feb 2, 2023",POSITIVE,It's one of the best movies I've ever seen.The stroyline is good the animation is good it's filled with actions and just overall good. very gud
"Feb 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film is CINEMA. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is an amazing movie. From the animation, voice talent, and mature story. This is one of the best DreamWorks movies of all time. Puss in Boots 2 has one of the best emotional moments in recent film history,  from Perrito's sad back-story, to Puss in Boots' panic attack, to Goldilocks' beginning with the bears. I hope this win Best Animated Feature at the Academy Awards so DreamWorks Animation can get their first win in 17 years!"
"Feb 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love this movie!!!! I wrote a really long review but it got deleted. Basically, the characters and actors have great chemistry and play off of each other so well!!!! Best movie of 2022! 100/10 would recommend!"

"Feb 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"it was very cute, I watched this 2 times."
"Feb 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"An absolute masterpiece. One of the best animated films I've seen in my entire life. So many memorable moments from the Shrek franchise, and just an all-around amazing film!"
"Feb 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Actually such a masterpiece that plays with doubt, anxiety, valuing your own life and learning how to be better. It's actually such a love letter to the fans it's actually crazy a Puss in boots movie got such an amazing treatment, this movie speaks to everyone, children, adult, teens, elderly, aliens, dogs, cats. It's honestly hard to make this movie not engaging and interesting, please DreamWorks let's keep the quality sky high from this movie onwards okay? I miss the time from Kung Fu Panda and HTTYD banger movies. 10/10 crazy good maybe better than Shrek 2, which already means a lot."

"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is AMAZING! The way they put so much time and effort just makes me want to see it. The movie is funny, entertaining and cute as well! And the blood scene is my favorite part."
"Feb 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was OK -kind of hard to follow.
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Melhor filme de animação do ano já.... História muito legal, o filme é engraçado, cheio de ação e muita emoção"
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pues sin Boots: The Last Wish is a must see. One of the best movies of the past 2 years. The villains weee amazing, and the plot was very interesting."
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,puss in boots is happy the movie
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,climatic masterpiece honestly
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Illumination needs to take notes; Dreamworks has laid out the blueprint on how to make a good sequel. This movie was fantastic, and it started with the animation. I love this new visual direction that the Spider-Verse is pushing everyone into, and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish capitalized. The action sequences were so quick and comic-like, and the colors popped. Beyond the look, the story was quite good as well. Dreamworks picked a good handful of messages to deliver and they did it well. I especially liked the arc with Goldi and the Bears, but the very real and very persistent personification of Death was also…fun? Maybe not the word, but I was very interested. There was a great blend of heart and humor and the voice cast was outstanding, especially Florence Pugh and John Mulaney. This is certainly the best kids' movie I've seen in a while, and I hope the Minions take full offense."
"Feb 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,NIce movie but i have to say it used to be better
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly the greatest movie I've seen in the last 3 years. This movie is well worth watching, and 100% worth your money. No agenda, no politics, not virtue signaling. Just downright amazing storytelling that I didn't know how much I missed."
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"best animated film of the year, absolute banger"
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best designs I loved the most is finally recognized for his greatest work!!✨💖
"Feb 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,I don't like the painterly design of the film. I wish they used Shrek animation style which is my favorite in all animations.
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie has altered my brain chemistry.
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story line, grwat action. Truly family friendly. This has got to be one of the best dreamworks production."
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish had a lot to live up to as most of my critic and casual friends have been praising the film, and for the most part the film delivers.

From the opening frames, the unique art style fills the screen and is incredibly captivating. There is some excellent combination of 3D animation with 2D styles that I have not seen before. The combat frame rate shift was also a nice touch that worked better than I was expecting. Action was top notch with some incredible set pieces and superb choreography.

The Last Wish deals with some pretty heavy themes for an animated children's movie. Death is something that all humans will have to face which was handled in such a nuanced and mature way here. From panic attacks to haunting imagery, death looms large throughout the entire film and serves as a menacing villain. The journey our heroes take to confront this fear is very heartwarming and will resonant with most audience members.

With most DreamWorks pictures, the comedy is targeted at both children and adults. I did find myself laughing out loud at plenty of jokes, but just as many landed flat for me. This would be more of an issue, but this is an incredibly balanced film with great action and dramatic moments that leave little room for a few flat jokes to make a large impact on my experience.

I genuinely believe that this movie has restored the Shrek universe and can propel the future projects upward. Hype has officially been restored for Shrek 5!

Score: 86%
Verdict: Great"
"Feb 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Genuinely good movie. Of course its not better than the OG, but its a worthy sequel that honors the original. Definitely worth the watch"
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,So very cute and so funny!
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love the movie, all of it. The animation was so great, the facial expression or gestures were so smooth and details that I can easily feel with the characters."
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a very contained story that didn't add unnecessary extra stuff. The side characters were a nice addition. Usually super happy characters are annoying and overplayed, but the one in the movie was written well. The villain was very intimidating and the message was well recieved."
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Myself and my sister were huge fans of the original, and I can say this absolutely blows the original out of the water. Best animated film since How to Train Your Dragon."
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining!  Excellent movie!
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Um filme simplesmente genial! Com um  vilão espetacular! Poucos filmes conseguiram adaptar tão bem essa animação 3D cartoonesca e Gato de Botas fez isso com maestria
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,it has no right to be this good but it does it anyway
"Feb 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The only explanation I have for all the positive reviews this movie is getting is that most of them come from adults who watched it with teens or without children. We went to the cinema with a group of 6-10 year old children (trusting the ""6 and above"" rating this movie got in Germany) and it was an awful experience for them.

Copious amounts of violence (some cartoonish and played for laughs, some way too intense for kids), references to and portrayals of gambling & alcohol, a lot of swearing & rude language (sometimes censored, sometimes not), references to animal abuse (partially played for laughs) and an anthropomorphic wolf character who symbolizes death and who's significantly too terrifying for young children. Multiple kids in the cinema started crying, had to be escorted out of the hall, or had to close their eyes for large stretches of the movie. At one point a character calls another character a ""p*ssy"" - which is a somewhat lame cat pun in the original English, but in German that's lost in translation and ends up being straight up vulgarity that has no place in a movie rated 6+. Beyond those crassly child-unfriendly elements, the plot of the movie and the underlying themes (living the life you got, facing death & fears) were neither interesting to nor understandable for our kids. Another issue was the fake Spanish accent of the main character. Since we saw the movie in German I can't judge the original voicework, but in the German version the main character was sometimes very difficult to understand even for the adults.

This movie illustrates a larger problem: age ratings have become practically meaningless, and we essentially need to pre-screen every single movie we're considering to show to our kids to make sure it's actually age-appropriate and won't cause pedagogic issues. In this case, trusting the German film rating board (the FSK), reading reviews and watching the trailer beforehand was evidently not enough, and we regret taking our kids to this movie. Thank you, FSK, for deciding that a movie that makes our kids leave with the mental image of someone drowning a puppy in a river is appropriate for ages 6 and above... 🙄

Those issues aside, from an adult perspective this movie was thoroughly ""meh"". The comic-book animation style was neat for the first few minutes, but became jarring later on since it was applied very inconsistently. The plot was somewhat bland and the characters didn't really stand out (with the possible exception of the dog). The side-plot of the bear girl and her adopted family felt tacked on, and the ending felt somewhat satisfying but very telegraphed. Most of the jokes weren't offensively bad but didn't really land either, and most of the references just served to remind us of older, much better movies that we could have been watching instead. The quality of the voicework (keep in mind I'm talking about the German version specifically!) ranged from okay-ish to aggressively poor.

Definitely not a movie we're going to see again, and definitely not a movie we would have shown our kids had we known what we were getting into beforehand."
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved death and the story was amazing
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,its great amazing movie DreamWorks has  redeem a legend
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,fantastic story animation and comedy
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolute masterpiece. The story has a good moral, the animation is soooo cool every facial expression of puss is perfect, i love the musics, i could watch it 100 times in a row!! Definitly recommend it."
"Feb 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"SAY HOLA TO HIS LITTLE FRIENDS.

Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a 2022 American computer-animated adventure film produced by DreamWorks Animation and directed by Joel Crawford 🐱 

Meh, it passed the time. 
Just. 😐
👍🏼👎🏼

While I enjoyed the animation and humour, the story and humour disappointed…

Puss in Boots discovers that his passion for adventure has taken its toll: He has burned through eight of his nine lives, leaving him with only one life left. Puss sets out on an epic journey to find the mythical Last Wish and restore his nine lives."
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, both artistic and story is deep and well done. As good as a pussy in boots can be!"
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a beautiful film
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Villain ❤️ It was really nice and fun to watch. The fact that I as an adult and a kid can watch together and still both enjoy it to the fullest ❤️❤️ Great animation.
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just finished this movie with my friends, and it had no business being as good as it was, the action was super crisp with that anime-esqe style that was made so popular by movies like spider verse, and the villain was genuinely threatening, with plenty of good laughs throughout. All in all, this movie not only surpassed my expectations, but blew them out of the water. I absolutely recommend it to any adult who grew up with the Shrek movies and was hoping for another good movie in this universe"
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is easily one of the best films I've seen in a long time. It was entertaining, funny, but was also able to handle the heavy topics like death and facing your own mortality perfectly. I would highly recommend everyone watch this movie."
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing humor and action sequences. I absolutely loved this movie.
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing film. The animation was incredibly emersive and the voice acting was perfect. The plot of the movie was moving and really struck a chord with me and many others who viewed the film, despite it being a children's movie. Amazing villains and antagonists that all play an important role in the film. Pretty great movie!"
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Perhaps the best movie all year. Definitely a tie with Top Gun Maverick. 
Fun at all ends and even when it slows down, it's enjoyable. 
All the characters bring something of value to the table and have interesting and entertaining stories. 
Wonderful narrative, captivating visuals and a beautiful message through out."
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I will say as someone who has always been interested in the animation industry for quite some time now, this has to be one of the most inspiring pieces of media to come out in recent years. With all honesty, I haven't been so lifted from my seat and excited about a film such as this since ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"", which I must thank for the seismic level shake it had on other studios for taking animation to the new level of storytelling which I believe this film provided. The Soundtrack as well is outstanding! Every single song on the album is a worthy hit which deserves to be replayed again and again, don't believe me, go check it out on Spotify or YouTube! Anyway, as much as the film was a flavorful and visual expressive ball of energy, it knew the perfect moments to slow down and take in impactful moments, and allow their audience to take it all in. Which leads me to discuss the topic of the film, Mortality, and by the stars! They encapsulated it perfectly. I was moved, for I believe it is something all ages and walks of life can understand, the inevitable and looming presence which death holds within all of us. The anxiety which we hold until we too are at that pass which we face the inevitable. Nonetheless, we continue and decide to make the most of the single life we are given, to fight for the life we want with those we love and care for. I have not seen a film tackle such a hard and difficult subject in quite some time, and successfully I might add. In conclusion, this is an outstanding and captivating film which deserves to be talked about for years to come."
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed watching this movie it was funny and really good
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I genuinely cannot find a flaw with this movie, after my 3rd watch I was still left wanting more, This movie does everything perfectly from the Animation to the story to characters, everything is perfect. If this movie doesn't win an Oscar they should be very ashamed."
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muito bom o lobo e incrível, passa boas mensagens simplesmente incrível"
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Cute movie!! Love Puss in Boots ☺️
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Best villain ive seen in YEARS. Gorgeous animation and a suprisingly touching and complex story
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"A very good movie with good characters, epic moments and a great teaching"
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Cute and entertaining.
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was perfect in every aspect. It has some of the greatest characters in animation history and the 3D mixed with 2D animation style is beautiful with that amazing colours. Another hit from dreamworks, 2 in a row."
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"I absolutely loved it. I was 7 when the first movie came out, and it was one of my favorites at the time. I was worried about this movie, but within the first 10 minutes, I loved it. There are a lot of easter eggs referencing the previous movie and the Shrek films, but you could certainly watch this movie without any previous knowledge of the character and still enjoy it."
"Jan 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Is the prettiest and best animated western children's movie in existence? Yes.

Is it more than that? Not really. The opening fight sequence is fantastic, and any time the animation team executed on an action scene, holy crap they were hitting home runs.

But at the end of the day, beyond a few scenes of genuine wholesomeness and tenderness, it's still just a western animated children's film. If that's all you ever watch, you're going to be very pleased. If you enjoy broader media, this is fairly formulaic.

Goldi and the Bears carry the film."
"Jan 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,I think the movie's script is really good but I'm not too fond of the animation. I miss the old animation of the old movie and the Shrek movies.
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is truly an amazing movie that people need to watch. This movie is easily one of the best children's movies out there and a lot more people need to see it. This movie is about characters trying to get the wish they want and they are doing anything to get it but while Puss is trying to get his wish, we see how scared he is of the new villain Death and how much fear he gets. We can see how Puss is trying to get his 9 lives back while meeting his old wife and making a new friend to get the wish. At the end of this movie, we get to see how Puss matures and leaves the last wish while fighting Death to let go of the fear of dying. This movie is truly special and shows you not to be scared of something and to fight back."
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,PERFECT!!! I'TS AMAZINNNNGG.
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,He thought it was a 5 star. There is a good balance of adult humor.
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Characters, and they all serve their purpose. There is many themes that is compacted perfectly into one film, and the film does great in knowing when it's time to set the tone for the movie. It's a perfect film."
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,This film was JUST AWESOME!
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fresh, funny, harmless, quick, improvement of the mediocre first installment. Also gets me excited for Shrek 5."
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is absolutely outstanding. The art style is gorgeous, the animation is fluent, the fight scenes are well choreographed, the story is mature yet fun at the same time, all the characters are great, the villains are a threat to the good guys and death is most likely the best villain in the Dreamworks catalogue. If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it now, you won't regret it. Or maybe you will, if you are deranged."
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the Best movies ever this movie absolulety revived the dreamworks saga totally going to win the oscars this year
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Surprisingly amazing film. It literally made me cry a few times which I was absolutely not expecting. The villains are absolutely fantastic as well.
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a fun movie! I only cried 5 times but it was worth it. About to drag everyone I know to go see it with me.
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning, charming, and an all around good time."
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hilarious, visually Charming, narratively well-executed. Not super child-oriented in its humour which makes it a refreshing entry to the field of new-age animated movies for the big screen. Must-watch if you are even remotely interested in animated media, cats or just good movies."
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was so refreshing from the other animated movies of 2022. From the animation to storyline to characters and antagonists this was an overall great movie. Absoloute must see
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"An unexpected twist from the first movie being bad. Amazing visuals, entertaining characters, super cool main character designs, and a pretty neat lesson taught. I enjoyed this movie to the fullest! Three times.. in the theater.. Maybe a fourth is in store for the future! :)"
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"A bit scary for little kids, but otherwise a fantastic family friendly movie."
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie explores layers of different adult moral questions and gives cohesive answers in a simple yet evocative way. Great execution, fun characters, great pacing, picturesque."
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Man is this movie something. Normally I don't leave reviews on movies but this movie is definitely probably one of if not the best there has been. I actually saw this movie twice and it was incredible rewatching it for all the details. The plot is interesting and it has a solid pace to it, the characters surprisingly very well fleshed out and fit perfectly into the story and messages. Absolutely phenomenal movie it is the bang for your buck. My congrats to dreamworks for creating this masterpiece. I highly suggest this movie to anyone willing to watch something fresh, visually captivating, thrilling, and overall to have a good time."
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best animated films I’ve seen in like 5 years. I’ve always felt the first film was under appreciated yet even I could admit there were a few faults. The Last Wish exceeded my expectations and did everything a children’s films should do, which is engage and educate on heavy topics like death and mortality."
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was so good and I was not expecting it at all. It covered anxiety, love, family, death, acceptance, and appreciation of life so well. This is proof that animation isn't just for kids."
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Family enjoyed it a lot highly recommended
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love the movie! My kids loved it also. Graphics was great and original, message very sweet and positive. Funny characters, sweet moments, action packed. Must see!"

"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a pretty good plot. Graphics were a bit shaky at times. The ending was wrapped up nicely
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,True perfection is being whole inside
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"I can not even begin to describe how beautifully done this movie is. The music, the animation, the story and the characters. This is by far the best movie I've seen all year. And one of the top five movies I've probably seen in the last five years. It's absolutely incredible for all audiences, with very funny scenes for all ages to enjoy, and heart wrenching / relatable scenes too. It gives a whole new perspective to puss in boots and the story is a very meaningful one at that."
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great character development, plenty of colorful characters but it never felt crowded! There was a lot going on in terms of plot, but the movie made sense most of the time. Funny."
"Jan 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie, really enjoyed it."

"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,I absolutely loved it!!!!!!
"Jan 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Way too violent of a movie for children. Moral of the story was good but it was overshadowed by all the fighting and violence.
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie! One of the best of its kind!
"Jan 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Nice animation style, a great villain, but the story was lacking"
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is one of the best animation that DreamWorks have done - Great story and songs, animation design, colorful, so many deep subjects and well done characters... I'm speechless! 
I loved all the characters, seeing a lot of Latinos voicing the characters is a huge plus! Antonio Banderas as Gato is unique and kept the character's signature, but I have to give kudos to Wagner Moura for voice of the wolf... It's not common to see Brazilian actors behind great productions like this one (if you don't know who he is, please check Narcos on Netflix... He played Pablo Escobar).
Puss in Boots - The Last Wish won't let you down, trust me!  Worth every penny and second. Kids and adults, mainly adults I will say, gonna love it!"
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good movie. Not as good as the first one, but I still liked it a lot. I think the only thing I didnt like was the animation."
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,What was a movie worthy of the Shrek universe returned

"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is amazing and a must watch for everyone!!
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"DreamWorks tells a more compelling story than Disney every time, and the fact that this movie seems to mark new beginnings for the series bodes well."
"Jan 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,We expecting more laughs given all of the hype. We really enjoyed it but would say it was run of run-of-the-mill fun. 
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best animation movie i've seen in years, an absolute must see"
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"The animation is one of the best I have seen in a movie for ages, and the story is compelling and that the portail of death in the film is perfect, 
Loved it"
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"When I first watched this movie, I didn't have very high expectations. The first movie was pretty mild, so I didn't think that this movie would be as banger as it was. This movie is probably the best animated movie I've seen in a long while. I don't know if it is appropriate for kids of a young age, because the villain of the movie is pretty violent for a kids movie. Parents, if you're reading this, make sure you know what you're kids are about to watch. If you are ok with them seeing mild blood and mild violence, then your kids are in for an amazing movie experience. (Watch this in theaters, it's totally worth it.)"
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,The grandkids and I loved it. Clever Fairy Tale spoof. Lots of action and tears at the end.
"Jan 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I didnt finish watching the movie we left 20 min before it ended 
My 6 year old noticed so many bas words it was annoying for her 
Maybe this is not a common review but thats my opinion"
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Gostei imenso do filme... cada cena foi bem planeada, o desenvolvimento dos personangens esteve incrível."
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great film for the whole family. Amazing animation, lots of good humor. Story intresting and sometimes deep. I highly recommend"
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"if u have social anxiety/ panic attack problems, WATCH THIS!! They did an AMAZING scene where they portray Puss having a panic attack. That scene alone sold me to this movie immediately. I haven't even mentioned the funny jokes and comedies too. it's just overall a great movie to watch alone or with your family or friends."
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Considering how bad movies are nowadays i had to give full starts, this has pretty much everything for great animation movie: good story,good characters, some wisdom for life and humor. Enjoyed so much watching this had more fun than with Avatar 2 or Maverick but those were really good movies too."
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie - really good, but kind obvious plot, but still heartwarming. Combine that with great animation and - most of all - amazing choice of colors and you get one of biggest surprises in animation department in about two years (for me)."
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,I would never forget this movie. It's more than a movie. I loved it.
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"puss in boots the last wish is my favourite movie of all time, the animation is perfect the story us surprisingly sweet as well as terrifying

10/10"
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"soooo good all the villain's are amazing written, it is so awsome for a kids movies to explore such mature themes, the humor lands and it can be serious when need be, and did i mention that the animation slaps? 10/10 must watch if you like good movies"

"Jan 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,It wasn’t really all that fr .
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"The animation is totally fresh and the voice work above and beyond. Everyone is a heavy weight in the voice over world here and create an incredible story, beautiful imagery, and heart that takes you all the way to the end. Incredibly enjoyable."
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is absolutely phenomenal. The characters, jokes, animation, plot, visual gags, etc. are all superb. I'll definitely be buying this one on Blu-ray when it comes out."
"Jan 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Really good, a bit predictable but the animation and the soundtracks are amazing.
One of my favorite movie."
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,After hearing so much about this movie from friends and online I went in with high expectations. I left the movie theatre feeling just as good about the movie as before I even saw it. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a great movie with interesting and funny characters that make it an easy ride all the way to the climactic ending. 10/10 would definitely go back and watch again.

"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"O que dizer animação maravilhosa, história fofa e cativante tendo seu momentos de ação e emoção. Mesmo sendo um filme considerado infantil tem uma plot que tanto crianças, quanto adultos irã adorar e se emocionar. 
Tem belos personagens, principalmente a bela construção dos vilões, mas os heróis não deixam a desejar.
E sério, que animação impecável, simplesmente não dá pra descreve-la em palavras.
Conclusão final, é um ótimo filme e não vá assistir achando que é só mais um filminho qualquer de criança com uma história mal desenvolvida, apenas assista, depois tire suas próprias conclusões"
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Made my inner child happy
"Jan 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's so good. the animation is beautiful and the action is so fun and exciting to watch. The main villain is so cool and genuinely quite scary. I was extremely invested in the story and all of the characters. 11/10, A massive W for dreamworks."

"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Great grandson enjoyed movie.
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's absolutely perfect. I came out of theaters thinking of any flaws that movie might have and confronted a void. Everything from voice acting, animation, humour, characters, to the whole story overall is simply 10/10. 
This might be the best animated movie I've ever seen in my life."
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is freaking awesome! Yes, I am an adult, but I still love animated movies. It's cute, funny, and has a story. If you have a sense of humor and penchant for fun, watch it. If you s a re a parent struggling to watch a movie with your child without groaning, watch it.,"
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muito bom, animação boa, e principalmente tem ótimos vilões!"
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,It was predictable ending but good story
"Jan 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worse movie I have ever seen in my life don't spoil your mood by going there

"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful movie, loved everything about it: the art, the animation, the score, the story, the characters - especially Death, he is so terrifying yet charismatic. The movie also does not shy away from heavy scenes; the panic attack one felt so real and impactful. I have not loved an animated movie this much since Spiderman Into the Spiderverse."
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie. I’m 30 and went with the wife and nephew. We all thought it was funny and action packed. I think we liked it more than the kids.
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best animated movie since ,,How to train your dragon 1,2,3"" , can't say enough of how good it was but i say this, PERFECT!!!!! 
AND FOR THE THE EMPTY HEADS WHO GIVE THIS FILM 1-2 STAR AND HAVE THE WORDS ,,didn't see the movie but it's probable bad '' HOPE YOU HOT PITCH IN HELL ."
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Kids entertained the entire time!
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best animated movie this year. Funny, heart warming, and very suspenseful"
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is epic animation with well-told story. It's really nice and fresh to see simply, animated story with (!) blood and really dark moments. It is surely the best American animated movie since Shrek came out. Proves that animation is not only for kids, just look, it was made for kids that was watching Shrek and first Puss in Boots movie many years ago. No politic commentary, no sexuality, no drama. Just music, story and you enjoying every minute."
"Jan 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'm amazed how popular this film is. I presume much of it has to do with how much we all love Antonio Banderas's Puss. 

The first film was brilliant -- it truly had everything for just about every demographic and I'm not sure I stopped laughing from beginning to end. I even enjoyed watching several episodes of the TV series that followed, with my daughter, who is now 8-years old.

This sequel was disappointing on so many levels, not the least of which was: editing) it was too long; 2) story line -- a bit thin, even for an animated feature; 3) and this is the most important, the writers/directors didn't seem to understand the kind of film they were making. While I understand the nature of the Puss in Boots created for the first film (which I love), as being a heroic and hopelessly non-self-reflective figure (which makes him so wonderfully funny), the sequel seemed to think it was produced by Marvel Studios, filled as it was with over-produced action sequences that were simply boring and repetitive (hence the need to cut 10 minutes). 

This will make a great case study in film school on how you take a sure thing and screw it up."
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie i ever saw. It looked beautiful and the characters were great.
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie! Excellent plot, amazing villains and hidden meanings. The actual villain of the movie (Death) is a costant presence that creeps the whole time. The other antagonists are wery well structured and characterised. There is an incredible character developpement for the main characters that really makes them all relatables. I really enjoied the movie."
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"laughed, I had fun, the story is very well done, the music and the songs are great, is entertaining and the characters are adorable, do you care what happens to them, the action scenes are wonderfully created, this film is for all audiences, children, adolescents and adults, I am 36 years old and I had fun. Thanks Puss In Boots 2 for showing up this year, thanks a lot! This film is really really good

I'll go see it again with my kid and have fun again."
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,My favorite movie in the entire Shrek universe and easily a top tier animated film for 2022.
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"10/10 mano, jogo bonito"
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good movie, loved the ending"
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"No ""modern audience"" BS = win"
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,İt was so amazing.the best things were the quality of animation and death.
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best movies I ever seen
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,With most companies making their films have an agenda and something political in them. I would like to say this is one movie this year that has stayed true to the way movies should be about telling stories. With Shrek movies revolving around fairy tails and stories Puss in boots really hits a home run with this movie. I love how they were not afraid to go to some dark places and some dark storytelling with Death and how they tied the ending. I am glad to say this movie is now one of my favorite movies with its art style they took something that I did not expect and made it work really well in this film. 10/10 would recommend it.
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Tears and wholesomeness
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,An incredibly talented cast highlights this intelligently designed animated thriller focused on beloved children’s characters with some darker adult themes. It is an entertaining journey throughout that all ages can enjoy.
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was great animation is so cool and the villain ""death"" is so scary even though it's a kid's movie but other than that is a very nice movie👍👌"
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Recently I don't have a much time for movies, but this movie captured my attention, especially the wolf. The plot, characters, and animation are perfect."
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful, full of heart, and with well-written character arcs. Every character, detail, and scene feels important and cared about. The plot is relatively simple, allowing for more depth and personal growth throughout. It’s absolutely stunning, and is definitely a crier and a must-see."
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic story telling with amazing characters. Especially the villain.
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"A truly amazing masterpiece, the animation is amazing, the story is amazing, the characters are funny and the jokes deliver very well! Absolute must see this movie yourself!"

"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Good but also has a deeper meaning to it while be fun and playful
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the original as a kid, so I was skeptical that they would botch a sequel, but I haven't been able to stop thinking about this movie since I watched it two weeks ago!"
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"the graphic, the twist, the goosebumps and their cute little perreto is just perfect"
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was alright, realistacally speaking i only watched the whole thing because Death is really cool. For real they need to make his own movie cus he was the most entertaining character in this whole thing, like seriously im utterly disgusted at every other characters perfomance as well as their acting skills. Death is and will forever be the greatest villain of all time. Period."
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved all the humor and diversity. There was not a dull moment during the movie. I was entertained through it all!
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Heartwrenching, with lovable protagonists and villains. I love the ENTIRE thing!"
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,usually i don't really like movies and i sleep mid way through them but this one was different everything was so good abt it man almost made me cry a few times the song fearless hero had something about it i had a smile most of the time and to top it off KAROL G ENDED IT LIKE WHATTT 5/5

"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Had to leave theater due to illness of niece, so we watched at home.  Very funny movie with great visuals.  The plotline is very good...with snippets of truths thrown in to teach values.  References to other fairy tale characters and situations kept popping up to make the film more enjoyable."
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Puss in Boots from a 36 year olds perspective is him not enjoying and valuing his life. And his mortality comes for him. Once he finds something and someone that makes him happy. (Life/Death) wants to take it away from him. Never give up.
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny show we cute animated cast.

"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Dreamworks at its finest
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, main villain is actually pretty terrifying, great for all ages even adults, had some surprising bleeped out bad language, but I didn't mind, the kids thought it was hilarious."

"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ensinamentos, roteiro simples e divertido, referências e personagem cativantes destacando-se o perro falador e o próprio gato, uma das melhores animações de todos os tempos, senhoras e senhores simplesmente gato de botas."

"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was FANTASTIC! The animation was great, the characters were great, the plot was amazing. I genuinely can't think of any flaws. You NEED to see this movie."
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the story and the characters!! Cant get enough of Puss in Boots! I also think I had a great positive message.
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was shocked they were making a sequel to the original Puss in Boots movie that was coming out more than 10 years after the first one. To my surprise, the story, the heart, and the animation in this film were phenomenal. While aimed for children, the movie is still incredibly enjoyable for adults, and there are moments that will connect with all audiences in the film."
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. References to old nursery rhymes.
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,very interesting!! must watch
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was good, honestly I think it was even better than the original, which is rare for a sequel. Fun plot to watch with the family, while also having some adult humorous moments. Overall, this and the Shrek series have always been above average. 
Antonio Banderas makes it that you can't imagine anyone else in that role!"
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Omg this was so good i loved it so much and the animation was absolutely stunning it is a must see omg
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"BEYOND EXPECTATIONS - The screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. And it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified."
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,It was funny and active
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a teen viewer I really liked that the story was easy to follow but dense enough that it was interesting. The message was positive and memorable too. I also really liked the art. Despite usually getting restless while watching movies, I can guarantee I didn't even check my watch while watching this one."
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Full chèvre, nunca visto una película mas en basada."
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"It probably cured cancer, idk. Just go and watch it"
"Jan 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"My daughter has always loved the Puss N Boots character, but she said this movie was the best."

"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was very funny and my kids loved it.
"Jan 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Boring. No real point. Fell asleep multiple times.
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entertaining, action, and funny"
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie wasn't what I expected and was better than I thought it would be.  My 12yo grandson thought that it was excellent and appreciated the the depth of Puss's angst and growth.  He also thought that it was cool that Goldie wasn't a bad person and choose the family she had over what she thought was ""just right"".  I appreciate that these thoughts came from my grandson!"
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Puss in Boots 2: The Last Wish is a perfect sequel to a mid film theres not a lot wrong with the first puss in boots but this film is perfect in every way the villain is one of the best villains I've ever seen
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"very good, amazing in fact"
"Jan 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,the subulities were good for older children and adults. Entertaining but a large amount of violence. I think Jack Horner's disdain & multiple ways of degrading and smashing his employees were a bit much.
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great animation, impactful theme and message."
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,It kept adults entertained as well as the kids!  Very good storyline as well.  Highly recommend
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is something that not only kids can enjoy, but teens and adults alike. The story is fantastic and delves into darker themes at times. It features multiple villains all with different tropes and manages to pull them off fantastically, with Death and Jack Horner easily being some highlights of the film. The characters are so lovable and the acting is great along with the humor. Absolute must-watch, easily the best animated film of 2022 and maybe even one of the best DreamWorks has to offer!"
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its so good, just watch it already. 
I have nothing but praise for all aspects of the movie, I never thought I'd be so enthusiastic about a puss in boots movie."
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Has a meaning behind it.
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely fantastic movie from start to finish. The music, characters, style, animation, every little bit was near perfection."
"Jan 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Movie wasn't too bad, nor that great either. I would give it three stars but have to take away star for the amount of cursing in it.  WARNING TO PARENTS:  GRATUITOUS CURSING IN THIS MOVIE. SOME IS BLEEPED BUT NOT ALL. NOT A GOOD FAMILY MOVIE IF YOU HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN."
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was 11 years since I saw the last Puss In Boots and this one didn’t disappoint Great acting cast,animation and very funny and emotional at the same time definitely a good family movie I would definitely see it again Ps: there are some bleep words in some parts of the movie but overall Amazing Movie!!"
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun for adults, excellent moral lessons"
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another absolute masterclass by Dreamworks, a great story, some top quality animation, and exceptional characters (special mention to one of the most badass vilains in animation history)"
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,It was funny sweet but avatar was better
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was the best I've seen in a while, in my opinion animated movies haven't been as breathtaking as this one in some time, and the story was just perfect. Plus death was a truly chilling character. 10/10"
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,cat fight wolf who is musical
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the animation. Able to have 3-4 character arcs in 1 movie without forcing it. Bomb soundtrack. LOVE PERRITO QUE CARIÑO ESE BEBE.
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"the puss in boots the last wish has very dynamic fights it is very well animated the villains are very unique and the writing in the story is very good. so this is a must see
i will recommend this movie"
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Espectacular, realmente el diseño y desarrollo de personajes aportar mucho a la trama"
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,So much fun for the family. All the characters were great and the plot is always creative.
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Outstanding and funny!
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfect... Just perfect.
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,super pooper cool with epic animation and s tier character development.
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Really funny and smart story telling!
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es fresca, audaz, hace reír, y a lo que va! Acción mezclado con la intriga de lo que va ha acontecer, espectacular! Divertida !!"
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was way better than I thought it would be, especially for a spin off sequel of a Shrek character. I really like how this movie handled the theme of grasping onto your mortality and realizing what's actually important in life and that it's more than just ""living up to your own legend"". It really made Puss look a look at himself and forced him to realize all that he took for granted in favor of his pride. 

The animation was great! I love it when animation strays away from hyperrealism and gets experimental like this. I wish more movies to be inspired by Spiderman: Into the Spider-verse and I want it to be a trend. Humans are very artistic creative!! We should express that more!

My only gripe is that while I actually enjoyed every character in this movie, I kind of wish the Bear family had less screentime or not exist at all in favor of focusing more on fleshing out Puss, Kitty, or Perrito. I was way more invested in those three than the B plot, but honestly the Bear family was enjoyable enough anyway. 

All in all, I loved the movie and while I feel some of its potential was untapped I think this is a great step forward!"
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely phenomenal animation and very enjoyable, a must see"
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,non l'ho visto al cinema ma è bello 10 su 10 approvato seesopazo
"Jan 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Movie was decent, was not a fan of the new animation style"
"Jan 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie was just OK.  The story wasn't great and the animation was campy.  We survived it.
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was the best, most heartwarming film I have scene be put out in a long time. This film has gone straight to the top of my list for animated films I would recommend to anyone."
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"ironic, comical, and all around hilarious"
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best of 2022, this film has a lot of laughs and stunning animated adventures but never is afraid to slow down and explore characters with earnest emotion and heart."
"Jan 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,Going in I did not have high expectations but this movie blew that out of the water! Another absolutely amazing movie from Dreamworks!
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was a bit skeptical at first because, I felt the animation would have been lazy, compared to previous DreamWorks films... but man was I wrong!!

the story had a really good flow, the characters were memorable (especially the dog and the wolf) and there were a few scenes that really made it feel enjoyable for older audiences.

I think the only ""minor"" set back was the animation in the action scenes, being to comic book styled.

but look, In my personal opinion... this is a great film for the whole family to watch, and I absolutely recommend it."
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"watch it. Words cannot describe how good of a movie it is. The mature themes that it isn't afraid to cover, the relationships the characters have, the amazing animation, character depth are all reasons you MUST watch the film to understand how good they are."
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good story line, funny and nice graphics!"
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"if only I watched this film instead of avatar I would have the best moments at the end of 2022, I'm not saying that Avatar: the way of water is not a good film I only regret not choosing a more suitable film to end 2022. Story is phenomenal, very emotional, good soundtrack, and such a great character development for each character on the movie"
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,go watch this movie right now!!!
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie amazed me with its visuals. The way everything moves makes sense. Also Puss having to accept he was going to die one day was relatable. Absolute masterpiece.
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"animation and models where GREAT, but the story-line wasnt that unique. it was that simple bad guy ends up working with good guys to fight bigger bad guy."
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"This has been one of the best animated movies I've seen in all time. Many people criticise that the visual style is similar than that of Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse, but quoting Pablo Picasso: a mediocre artist copies, a great one steals. This movie robs the visual style, it doesn't copy it, it makes it its own and goes to tell a beautiful story with it. Well-built characters, great arches, a masterful villain (not the plump Trump), and good comical writing mixed with deep messages. A true work of art. Congratulations Dreamworks & team."
"Jan 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not appropriate for kids, and not really enjoyable for adults. Characters weren’t funny. Overhyped "
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"cute, funny, action packed and great story"
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie!! The animation was perfect, the characters were amazing and easy to love, as well as the story line and added censored curses. Definitely a fun watch and would highly recommend :) 333"
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Good Movie great character nice ending best movie of the year
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was great!  We laughed!  We cried!  We learned (Spanish) and we spent time as a family at a family appropriate movie!
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,I was worried it would turn out to be overhyped. And I was oh so wrong. I cannot even entertain the idea of giving it less than 5 stars.
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,An amazing must watch sequel
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Best modern animated movie by far.
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,very enjoyable family film that surpasses some expectations and keeps you engaged throughout.
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Great cartoon for family
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,So happy with this second part.
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this movie from its stead fast action and picture book visuals. The comedy is very funny even for adults and the movie can be very emotional at times. The characters fit so well and create fun dynamics. This movie isn't afraid to show its characters flaws and I would say that it is a huge element in the movie.
"Jan 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I took 4 of my grandchildren, ages ranged from 2-5, to see Puss in Boots and was sadly disappointed.  It had some inappropriate language, and the story was on the darker side.  The grandkids didnt like it either.  I give it 1 star.  Dont waste your time and money on this one."
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish was a phenomenal movie. The action, animation, and art style are all top-tier. The amount of work the studio put into the animation scenes must have been incredible, because I can't stress enough how fluid the animation was. I did some background research, and the animation team that worked on this movie also worked on Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse, which makes sense. You definitely see it in their quality of work. The story itself was unexpectedly deep. I must say that, for a children's film, the themes and symbolism are all quite complex and powerful. If you are an adult watching with children, I strongly advise you to pay attention. The morals of the stories at the end are all very heartwarming. Goldilocks, the Three Bears, and Puss in Boots are among my favorites. Overall, a fantastic film."
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was great worth every penny
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun movie with good messages.  There were some tense moments, but not overwhelming. very sweet."
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good. Definitely a little scary for the we ones and some missed opportunities for bigger feels and set ups that don't pan out overall a great time.
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely beautiful animation, amazing characters, and the most unapologetically evil villain I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing. I cannot stress enough how much of a must-see this movie is."
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story and animation.
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,was not expecting this movie to be so good. It was hilarious
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Beautifully made.  Fun for the whole family.
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie offers so much for the older viewers. The character of death is chilling but rightfully so, and the amount of hidden imagery to look for is amazing. The animation is beautiful, the storyline is fresh and emotional, and this is definitely one I would recommend, and WILL be watching again!"
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,LOVE this—absolutely charming & clever: Fun for all ages! Hoping they make a third installment sooner rather than later!
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,This is so far the best movie in 2022. Even with low budget they manage to execute everything perfectly. Great story line and a Great sequel. Hopefully this wins an oscar.
"Jan 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Dark, violent shouldnt be rated PG"
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incrível, melhor filme do ano"
"Jan 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really cute animation similar to Spiderman in Spider-Verse art style of the movie, really touch me back in 2011, when I watched Puss in Boots 1, I thought it's gonna be last but thanks to the sequel, puss in boots: the last wish, and I do not regret paying to see it!"
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was such a surprise for me.  I usually am not a fan of animated movies as I'm 16 now but this completely amazed me.  With some of the best character writing I have seen ever with the character death who was written with such expertise it left me in an uncontrollable state of tension and suspense when he was on and off screen.  Death is without a doubt my favourite villain to be brought to us definitely this year and possibly of the decade, leaving me a young adult even a little uneasy at times which is the only reason that this movie is getting anything below a 4 star rating as many parents were worried thinking that death was too terrifying for a PG movie, but please do not let this put you off as this movie is masterpiece.  Not only does it have amazing character development it also has amazing animation with dream works implementing a unique style to the movie with flashy colours.

I'm conclusion I would without a doubt recommend this movie as a must see as I watched this movie about 2 weeks ago now and I couldn't get it out of my head how truly great this work was, even motivating me to write a review for the first time in hopes that more would take up the chance to experience this masterpiece with big releases like avatar overshadowing the movie when in my opinion puss in boots is a far greater movie than avatar was"
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,This was an amazing movie! I loved the characters the story and the animation!
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely fantastic movie. My wife asked me to see this and I went reluctantly but after it ended I must admit this is one of the best movies I’ve seen in so long. 
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,An absolute masterpiece. The animation is phenomenal. The story is original and brilliant. Puss in Boots is badass and cute. What more can we ask?
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was a awesome animation movie and love the battles
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Cute story. Has action scenes smaller kids might be scared to watch. Some mild ""naughty words,"" and bleeping of bad words for comic effect."
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"When I say this is brilliant movie, it is an understatement to how beautiful, creative, wonderful of a movie this is. A brilliant must-see movie that you just HAVE to watch over and over again because of much gorgeous details there are in the animation but also in the amazing writing that just has you enjoying the movie's attentiveness to even the smallest details. The animation style is plain fantastic and suits this kind of world so perfectly. There's even beautiful writing in its soundtrack in its repetition to the ""Fearless Hero"" score that makes this movie that much more BRILLIANT. Going to go see it again soon!"
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is the one to finally beat HTTYD as my favorite movie. To think such great movie is an sequel to very avarage movie that Puss in Boots was is unbelievable. It had everything from great animation style, great character development, drama, great vilains and comedy that will make both adults and kids laugh. It made in my opinion the perfect villain, the death, being present only a little bit but enough for you to not forget him and when he does show up he'll always make you worry for Puss and remember every scene with him in it. He's exttemelly powerful and movie  acknowledges this by not letting Puss defeat him. Other two villains the bear family and Big Jack Horner are great as well and both complete opposites of each other, while one has goal that can be understood and in the end gets redeemed the other one is straight up evil for no reason other than power. Puss also gets great character growth going from someone lone wolf who thinks they're better than everyone else to someone who wants someone he can spend rest of their life with. Definitelly recommend this movie for anyone doesn't matter how old they are or what they like, this movie has something for everyone."
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,The best movie ever! You'll never see a kids movie or any movie amazing as this!
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"IT WAS SOO GOOD!! I know the animation style was semi-inspired by spider verse but that makes it so much better,the character development in this and characters are great!"
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining and well written film.
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie had no business being as drop dead good as it was. Death was meanacing, Goldie and the Three Bears were hilarious, Jack Horner was sooo funny!! The chemistry between Puss, Kitty, and Perrito was amazing and I loved every second of this movie!"
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Masterpiece. I loved it.
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Death is one of the most well built villains I've ever seen!
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is fantastic. rom the story to the animation, it is a masterpiece."
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Grande filme. Uma fábula escrita com muitos detalhes e que não perde pontos. Melhor vilão que vi nos ultimos tempos. Apenas critico a qualidade no desenho, (apesar de estar muito bom), muito facilmente vemos ao longo do filme que se trata de um desenho animado. Coisa que nos filmes anteriores da DreamWorks não acontecia. O design dos personagens e do ambiente eram tão bons que parecia real. Por exemplo: ""Como Treinar o seu Dragão"", ""Kung Fu Panda"". Na minha opinião, neste filme a qualidade foi menor."
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Ayo best movie of 2022
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I really liked the movie this movie is the animation that can be said amazing they made a very well made movie with a great script with funny scenes and scenes where you should really make us think about things.
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Perito was my favorite
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfect to watch with the homies
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"The truth is that I liked the movie and I enjoyed it very much, a very good villain that is death and this movie also gives you reflections that I understand is with death, which values ​​and enjoys life and respects death and what I understood with Goldilocks and the Three Bears is that you accept and value your family, this film deserves the Oscar for best animated film"
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was fantastic, not just for little kids, but even teenagers and adults. Surprisingly the villain actually strikes fear, instead of the usual not so great anti-heroes we are used to in children's movies. While it may be a predictable plot, the story and the idea are superb."
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it, for someone who watched all the Shrek movies and the first Puss in Boots, this movie is just the best, aside from the life lessons it gives, and the perfect characterization, it was all put together so perfectly."
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is absolutely amazing...I still can't believe that theres bad reviews that say: it's bad because it copies the spiderverse style of animation. Like dude BFFR, many movies are doing that because they want to adapt to new animations style that are getting popular, just because it has 2d with 3d and the change of fps like spiderverse does doesnt mean it is a bad movie...I know wolf is overrated but cmon, the symbolizing and everything related to him in the movie was awesome. I just hope that this movie can pass the 300 million that it already has and i also hope that more people get to enjoy this masterpiece. I loved the first movie and i really really hope that this movie gets more than 500 million like the first one did!!! :] (sorry for my bad english)"
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Splendid, definitely the best movie for 2023's opening"
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I love cats and i love puss in boots and i like how the story about him defeating his ego
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best animated movie of 2022 better than the bad guys or the baby boss 2 Who was just a very bad movie not the bad guys but if someone tells me why they need to watch this film 
First: a very funny movie
Second: some dramatic scenes
Third: Death is just the best character villain of all time
Final: A fucking SHREK reference"
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its an amazing film, with a great animation and music, an story that may not be really complex, but works. The characters are amazing, really well written and so charismatic. Its a must see for children and adults."
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it and my kids enjoyed it as well
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,A surprisingly brilliant spinoff.
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie. I’m an adult and I loved it. Enjoyed every bit of it . It has everything . Action, comedy , drama, nostalgia all in one."
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,11/10 movie checks all of the boxes of a perfect cinematic peice
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"The wolf is hot, The bears are hot, everyone is hot. Except John Mulaney"
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I love cats!!!  I love how parts of the movie looked illustrated like a childs book.  LOVED seeing Goldie Locks and the 3 bears.  Soooooo cool.
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,best movie ever made. 
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie but girlfriend was fighting sleep demons the whole time. She worked a long day. But overall i loved it😊
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful graphics & nice storytelling, loved it!"
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, in fact I was not going to see it. I thought it was for kids but you know its mostly for adults. The CGI was spot on,, and the lines in the movies were relevant and meant some thing. It had a story line for all of us, and bought back a lot of memories and even funny. Nice Movie,,, it was recommended to me,, I will recommend this movie. And perhaps see it again.  Nice job,, Hollyweird  DreamWorks... nice job. I guess you have a few creative people working for you,,, Keep it going Monster Ink,,,"
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is amazing so it would a better review to talk about why I and others like it specifically not say ""it's great I would watch it again""
So this technically Doubles is a critique of the film industry 
1 good story,  graphics , writing all that stuff that makes a hit. its vary rare these to all of these while also not having some other bad thing mess it all up

2 safe messaging or more accurately the movie has a message that doesn't  ruffle any feathers or a message that's only understood by one generation. everyone fears death,All of us make bad choices and most people understand the need for a good family . It has no political messaging (which vary rare that a big movie like this has no political messaging) and everyone understands the messages it does have. 

For only two really good reasons a film can top the charts and make this kind of a masterpiece it will a strong contender for best movie of 2023 definitely."
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Gato de botas 2 é o melhor filme de animação que assiti em 2023, Lindissimo e uma história simples e rica!"
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie had an amazing art style and a lot of passion put into it that can clearly be seen when you watch the movie. It's a lot of fun for the whole family, me, my sister (15), and my brother (6) all had a great time!"
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,This was really a cute little movie! I really enjoyed it. And the actors did a good job portraying the parts. Storyline was good too.
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"After wallowing in mediocrity for over a decade making low effort movies, DreamWorks reasserts itself as a leader of animation just like they did in 2001 when they popularized and made the genre of 3d animation into the powerhouse it is today.

I think they learned their lesson after being outshined by other studios for so long and decided to go back to the drawing board. It's clear Sony's Into The Spiderverse was a big inspiration for the movement, camerawork and stylization. They do their best to make the fights as dynamic as possible with long shots with a camera as well animated as the characters as they swing and jump around the scene with impressive fluidity. 

The movie aims for a step above the more lowbrow elements of the Shrek franchise while retaining all of its defining charm and creativity, making it one of the most impressive accomplishments of the DreamWorks team alongside Shrek 2 (another incredible sequel)."
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful animation, vibrant colors that are appealing to the eyes, and good plot, pacing, and comedic timing. Casting was also very good too, especially John Mulaney's performance. Enjoyable for all ages!!"
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,so good  i loved this movie.
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story with amazing, gorgeous graphics and with a spectacular soundtrack to boot! Definitely going to catch it again in theaters."
"Jan 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Yawn. Slept through most of this. 
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,It was so good and the ending was perfect. The storyline and task were amazing
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is better than avatar 2 in literally every point
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie has no right being one of the best movies of all time, but it is anyway. Highly recommend!"
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,AMAZING OMG SUCH A REL MOVIE MADE ME CRY I LOVE THIS MOVIE BEST AFTER SHREK 2 AND HTTYD
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Animation is amazing and it is a fun film, funny, and awesome."
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"me pareció increíble aparte de la nostalgia y el amor a esta, nos enseña a valorar mas la vida de lo que crees:)"
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie blew me away. I seriously did not expect a children's movie to be this entertaining. The comedy, action, and the way the animation would seamlessly transition between 3D and 2Dish was cool to see as well. I can confidently say this is the best animated movie I've ever seen, with into the spiderverse as a strong second."
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Idk how a puss in boots movie became a top 3 film of all time for me but it did.
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great art style, amazing story, will watch again"
"Jan 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This sequel is far more appealing than its predecessor in every way. From the beginning of the movie, captivating animations combined with adventurous music attract watchers' attention. Before watching the sequel, I had low hopes for this movie, but my opinions were immediately swayed at its very start. This film grabbed my attention in a way much different than the first Puss in Boots did.

In The Last Wish Puss realizes that he's used up his 9 lives- except 1. A Grim Reaper haunts him everywhere he goes, reminding him of his possible death. Puss learns of a wish he can make on a star, which he decides he will utilize to receive more lives. He meets a chihuahua and an old friend on his way to find the star. The movie covers his adventure to find the star and includes heartfelt scenes between multiple characters. 


Overall, the animations and scenery in the movie are enough to draw watchers' attention. The plotline of the movie is very interesting for viewers of all ages."
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Exceptional. Far better than Avatar 2.
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Had a fantastic storyline. Puss is probably my favorite childhood character, so maybe I'm a little biased... Seen it numerous times. The animation was beautiful. Favorite movie."
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely amazing. Great animation. Great characters and their development. Great story. Just GREAT.
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"TRE MEN DO, yo creo que en mi opinion se merece el oscar, guion muy bueno, mensaje muy bueno, animacion muy buena, todo de esta peli es buena, no veo casi nada malo. 9,6/10"
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Best animated movie in a while! The antagonist and villains were really well done and the subject of the movie was handled well. All around a good movie and just no complaints whatsoever.
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I didn't see the original Puss In Boots from 2011, and I'm one of the seemingly very few people who's never been a fan of the Shrek franchise. Imagine my surprise then, when I sat down to watched the feisty feline's latest cinematic venture, The Last Wish, and got a massive kick out of it. I don't have anything against the character, he just happens to be a secondary player in a film series I never liked, so he was never on my radar. But his newest film is, from what I've heard, superior to the original, and certainly more well regarded than the later Shrek flicks. Its not only got a lot of great comedy, but it manages to have its share of serious moments, and treats them with respect. When the characters are musing on the importance of family, loyalty and the perils of mortality, the film isn't constantly throwing in one liners of making obnoxious gags that take you out of the moment. As such, the characters feel real and, for lack of a better word, human. The quest is fun engaging because you know what each individual wants and why they want it, the animation, borrowing heavily from Into The Spider-Verse, uses imperfections and roughness to make things look more like classic fairy tales, and when the comedy hits, usually unexpectedly, it gets big, well-earned laughs. Unlike Spider-Verse, it's not a game changer, but the effort that's been put into its appearance, it's story and its characters, makes it more than worth your time."
"Jan 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,It Really Okay Not Gonna Lied About It
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Cat tries to find meteor while being chased by dog
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Nothing more than a cinematic masterpiece.
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,My sister likes cats she likes it a lot it has action almost at every point I love it
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,This is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen. PERIOD.
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Finally, FINALLY. Kids movies have gotten so frustratingly shallow that seeing this was just an amazing breath of fresh air. Good emotional depth, amazing characters, tons of fun to watch with INCREDIBLE animation. Watched it on the big screen, no regrets,"
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"At first, I've decided to watch this movie just for the curiosity to see the wolf that have became famous on Twitter, but in the end, the entire movie was really awesome. Another thing that must be said about this movie : The frame-rate it's just like the Spider Man into spider verse — completely AWESOME — and makes all the different."
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,the message this move is sending is amazing and the villains are balanced and all tell their own story amazing the animation is stellar to my goooooddddd
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Nice pleasant movie for the entire family. Pretty rare to see strong moral values in a movie today. Such a refreshing show.
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,ADORABLE. Please make more
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"The contains colourful, and beautiful animations. It even has a story about anxiety and fears. 10/10"
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"You will not be disappointed.  This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  I can't wait until I can buy it! The visuals are beautiful, and the storyline will touch your heart,"
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,THIS IS SO AWESOME MOVIE I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA FLOP BUT I'M WRONG IT IS THE BEST!!!
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfect. That's all I have to say.
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Un guion inteligente, un aspecto visual insuperable, un estilo muy característico, el carisma tronchante de su protagonista, un villano intrigante y aterrador, una aventura divertidísima y educativa, y, finalmente, referencias nostálgicas acertadas y bien dosificadas forman un cóctel grandioso que hará disfrutar al espectador de principio a fin. La mejor película del universo Shrek después de la que dio inicio a éste."
"Jan 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Back to form for Dreamworks. Puss in Boots is surprisingly mature kids film that will appeal to both children and adults alike. This movie tackles topics like death and anxiety and handles then in a fun and entertaining way.

"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such a cute movie I was compelled to see out and watch its predecessor. I knew who Puss was because of the Shrek movies but I had never met Kitty Softpaws. The animation, especially in 3D, is spectacular. Very entertaining for all ages. Also has a sweet moral message without being overly preachy, for kids"
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Literally everything was good about it. The animation is super high quality and beautiful. The story is fun and the characters are all memorable. It was funny too. It's hard to choose if this or Avatar was the best movie of 2022, it was that good."
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,The animation was amazing. Death(the Big Bad Wolf) is an remarkable villain. I loved the lesson of valuing your life and what you have in front of you. Look like Dreamworks really made a comeback

the movie was amazing"
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in boots the last wish saved my life, my marriage, and changed me as a person. I will never be the same. It was the most transcendent sublime and holy experience i have ever had. I almost cried. I might be a furry. They put their whole pussies into this movie. 

Please go see it omg"
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,So let's be clear here this movie is one of the best things that could've ever happened to the Shrek Franchise. The animation was very well done and the plot story was very good. But for me what makes this movie so enjoyable to watch is that we see death the main villain and man dream works out for themselves on him…plus the idea that Puss N Boots could die truly increases the stakes of the movie very much. So all in all it is a must see regardless of age.
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know why some people says that the graphics for the movie are bad, I really like how it looks! I got captured into the movie in the giant part. Absolutely  amazing, there's a lot of things I'd like to put here too but I won't talk that much you know?"
"Jan 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No me gusto la animación de gato con botas 2, se ve como comic, no es como la pelicula de la saga de shrek y pelicula de gato con bota 1 … supongo que la animacion de 2022 es mas rapida y facil. Ojala que la pelicula de kung fu panda 4 sale la misma animacion que kung fu panda 3,2 y 1. Que no sea vea como animacion de comic… como estamos año 2023 en adelante desde que empezo 2021 la animaciones de las peliculas son cada ves diferentes que antes… y no entiendo porque cambio, fijense la animaciones. la empresa de deamworks ha cambiado los trabajadores ya no son como antes, se fueron"
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is great its a must watch just trust me. Its the best animated movie I've seen,props to the voice actors especially antonio banderas(the voice actor of puss in boots) you can really feel the emotion in his voice."
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is absolutely the best movie this year. I was blown away by the new animation style. Considering this is a kids movie, my almost adult brain almost cried at the end it was so amazing. Words cannot describe how much I recommend this movie. EVERYONE GO WATCH RIGHT NOW!!!!!"
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Spectacular film. It brings important values, such as overcoming your fear, valuing your friends and the people around you, supporting you. Kind of movie we watch and are amazed by the emotion it conveys to us. In addition, the animation is spectacular."
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I wasnt expecting to like this movie us much as I did. I dont like cats and i never saw the original Puss in boots so my expectations were low but I was pleasantly surprised. This movie was great.
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Furry here, so kinda biased, but the movie stands on its own. BEST MOVIE 2023!!"
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is very funny and good at the same time. Everyone should give it a chance and they will feel surprised just like I did when I saw it.
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Animation was amazing, characters were super cool and fun looking, plot was great, and overall it was a great movie!"
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I created an account just to rate this moving, it was actually that good!"
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,It's surprisingly good
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,O  filme é muito foda recomendo
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Existentialism and taking in moments of much needed self-reflection. Definitely one of the best dreamworld had put out over the past few years. I loved every single moment of this film, heartfelt and nuanced, but most of all philosophically poignant to what it means to place meaning in our lives as individuals.Bravo Dreamworls.!"
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Film magnifique que ce soit dans l'animation ou les messages transmis. Le personnage principale casse son image de héro parfait et sans peur pour devenir plus humain (ironique pour un chat) mais il n'est pas le seul à être intéressant. Perro amène avec lui beaucoup d'humour malgré un passé très noir mais compense avec un optimiste à toute épreuve. Boucle d'or et la famille d'ours m'ont aussi touchés au point où j'aimerais bien voir leurs prochaines aventures. Les antagonistes, eux, sont très différents avec Jack Horner qui est le méchant pur et sans once de gentillesse ce qui contraste bien avec le ""méchant"" que tout le monde à retenu : La mort. Pour le coup, je ne le considère pas comme méchant car il est là pour faire son boulot et le fait qu'il laisse le chat potté à la fin témoigne de l'évolution du personnage principale. Un antagoniste lourd de sens qui rien à son sifflement ferra donner des frissons aux spectateurs tel la respiration de Dark Vador."
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I can't believe they finally understood that good animation It doesn't have to be realistic. But it's the beauty of the elements of the movie.
Both the plot and the fight scenes came out very well done. It was the animation that impressed me the most after a long time."
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a fun and colorful movie. They really outdid themselves with this one and I hope they do more like this! Puss in Boots has become one of my favorite movies ever!
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"i am completely surprised by the meaning and story of the film, which i don't have any expectation as my son dragged me into the theatre. but it is so good and i am moved by the plot!"
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie is fucking amesome
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,You don't need lives to spare because it's best to share one life with people you love. - my son told me this is what he took from the films message.
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"excellent , great ,i liked"
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Carga emocional gigantesca !!!!
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Easy to watch , no political bulshit ,good story ,amazing animation , congratulations"
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun, cute movie. Loved the music and so many laughs. Heartwarming story of discovering that what you wanted was with you all along. Thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the best Movie I've seen from this year, and honestly tops ANYTHING I saw in the 2010's. Every single thing in this movie is executed perfectly. The Villain is a perfect love to hate character, Puss' and Kitty's arcs in the movie are so strong and you really feel what they're going though, all while keeping the familiar feel the Shrek universe is known for. This is not only better than the first Pus In Boots movie, it's honestly one of the best movies I've EVER seen. The animation is incredible, incredible, the Characters are well written and dynamic, and it's frankly, just fun the whole way through. It's a movie that's not afraid to pull it's punches, and I love it!
I really can't put into words my feelings about The Last Wish. It's an amazing animated movie, heck, it's an amazing movie. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out on something BIG!"
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,So cute so funny good story line so heartfelt. Action scenes were cool.
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the perfect movie for everyone. It has humour that only adults would understand, but it also has an important message. It has many exciting characters protagonists and antagonists. Probably my favourite is Death in this movie the character death was an interesting concept for a villain. This movie will put Dreamworks back on the map. In my opinion, this is the perfect kid's movie."
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Brought my partner to tears, I love the animation style and the message, really REALLY loved this movie."
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, one of dreamworks best"
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was an adorable movie and really well done as far as animation and style are concerned. The story is decent enough to capture parents attention, as is par for the course for Dreamworks animated films, and the new characters are fleshed out well and humorous. The bad guy is creepy and cringey, so perfectly done as per Dreamworks standards. 
Although using their usual 3D Animation, they've added some new timing and stylization to this movie so it has a bit of a different feel to previous installments of the Shrek/Puss In Boots movies but, for me, it's a welcome change. I dig it.
This is definitely an enjoyable family movie with plenty of hidden gems for mom and dad and adorable moments for the younger kids."
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Both my brother and I are very critical of movies and while our opinions as two random teenagers don't really matter, we could not find anything to complain about with this movie. My only hope is that more people get to see this surprisingly amazing movie."
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Hilarious and fun! First time leaving the theater surprised in a while
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Family-friendly fun.
"Jan 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ok, but not exceptional."
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a really fun movie! It was worth the wait.
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is so damn gud bro dreamworks be putting in that work, overall great movie 10 out of freaking 10"
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Way to go. I will pay 12 dollars for a nap, but not with this movie. Great writing and acting. It had me at the opening scene!!"
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"funny and entertaining, enjoy the references."
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"awesome story, great adventure. 5 stars"
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was spectacular!!
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Masterpiece, I don't care about any flaws because the rest of the movie is so powerful and amazing that it just doesn't matter if there is anything wrong with the movie it's just that good."
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I was waiting to watch this movie since it came out and I couldn’t watch for life reasons and all I can say it’s that it was worth the wait
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't how to say, but truly I love the movie so much, I watched it 3 times in a week already. My favourite characters are Death and Jack Horner, the villians are terrifying, funny and well executed. Even the storylines are well told. Even the animation style is so unique and fresh, like it's a mixture of clay animation."
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,if you are going to cancel a movie you have to go through me first
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm speechless of how good this movie is, given some recent mediocre works from dreamworks, it took me out of guard the quality of this movie, when I saw the first fight scene with that cool 3d/2d animation I knew this was a good movie, but later, the ""Death"" appeared with that fight scene at the bar, and it was at that moment where I realized my eyes were witnessing a masterpiece. Simply incredible, every character delivery is great and fits snugly in the film. I'm so keen to give it some rewatches"
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I absolutely loved the storyline and the villain. I would 💯 percent recommend this movie for anyone who wants a thrilling and entertaining movie. I loved the tiny details they put in the movie to really give you that thrilling/amazing feeling that I personally love and I am sure you will agree with me after you watch this exceptional film.
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Eu assisti o filme hoje e achei muito bom e sensacional.É um filme que respeita os fãs da dreamworks e as crianças de todas as idades diferente de outras empresas concorrentes como a disney que aderiu a muito tempo a uma doutrinação  progressista e por isso está fazendo péssimas animações atualmente.Gato de botas 2 é  totalmente recomendavel,podem assistir sem medo."
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, emotional story, nostalgic."
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is without a doubt an All Time Classic. Everything is better in this. The story, it does what a sequel is supposed to do. The voice acting is flawless with Perro being one of the best animated characters I've ever seen. The animation is incredible and stands with some of the best I have ever seen all time. The editing and pacing is flawless in this. I am in total shock how good this was. Everyone should see this once, you honestly don't even need to see the first one. It's THAT Good."
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not only the best Shrek film, but an all-out masterpiece the whole way through. The Wolf is the best villain to come out of the studio and every movie needs to have animation that's this good!"
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie is just incredible.
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was an emotional roller coaster , the perfect mix of childhood nostalgia with an amazing new answer refreshing story. From the animation to the new characters and the plethora of messages in it . Truly a masterpiece in the animation sector and beyond!"
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Uma experiência SURREAL!!! Gato de Botas apresenta personagens novos incriveis e super carismaticos, espande MUITO o universo de Shrek! história cativante, romântica, tensa, divertida e muito psicologica. Pode parecer estranho ouvir isso de uma animação infantil, mas sim! O filme aborda de uma maneira muito atensiosa sobre o amadurecimento e crises do nosso heroi, Faz tempo que eu não vou a o cinema ver uma animação desse nivel..."
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,It was fun  and funny.
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,the best animated film of 2022
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love everything about this movie, the 2d, and 3d animate styles, the humor, and the action are intense. Totally worth watching it."
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was so cool love the wolf villain
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story and super funny! Can't wait to see it again!!
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dreamworks Animations did an amazing job with this movie! Especially with the villain, Death, better known as wolf brought me chills anytime I heard it’s whistle."
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie is amazing in every way
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,New breath in the 2023 animation
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Some cat spends 8 of his lives then the manifestation of Death chases him for the rest of the movie. 10/10 Became a furry.
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie quite literally changed my life. I went in thinking it was just a silly kids movie. Wow was I wrong. It asks so many moral questions that make you look at your existence. Materialism, happiness, death, life ect. All of that address in a kids movie? Along with amazing animation and a villain we have not seen the likes of from dream works in decades literally. This movie is so good just watch it…"
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Exactly what you expect from PiB. Entertaining, great animation, fun, cute."
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,very funny and a great storiy.  Some great voices for the different characters.  REally really cool.

"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything you could want in a movie. Genuinly surprised with how much I ended up enjoying it.
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,We all loved it and we thought it was so refreshing we saw it a second time. Great plot and even better Villains!
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a fresh breath of air for mainstream animation. Death is a menace.
"Jan 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This film was done beautifully. It had very dynamic characters. I will not say that it was not a great film, but it wasn't really the film for me. It had a lot of unnecessary crudeness and it was pretty violent for a family film. The music was amazing, the plot was fantastic, but it also had its downfalls. I did not like Perito. I do believe that the movie needed a character like Perito, with his innocent kindness, but Perito specifically was not a good choice. Also, I feel like this film did not have good development for Puss in Boots because he had to relearn some themes that were taught in the first film."
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was really good.  The animation was beautifully done, and the story held my interest from beginning to end."
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Puss in boots vs Death (wolf). Is the best fight 10/10 🔥
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Es una excelente película con un muy buen mensaje además de tener personajes carismáticos y agradables 🐱
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,incredible movie there is no way to discuss incredible story the jokes are perfect
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Was very enjoyable and silly fun
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"The message of the entire movie is, great! I would totally recommend watching this!! The plot is a 10/10, character development 10/10, and the animation 10/10!!! If u want to see a great movie watch puss in boots"
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"What an amazing surprise this movie was. I'm very glad I went to the cinema to see it. The story is greatly paced. The humor is very subtle  and comedic timing is good, fight scenes are amazingly animated, voice acting is superb and of course the ""Wolf"" stole the shiw. Every time the Puss got the chills... So did I."
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Un nuevo comienzo por parte de DreamWorks. Animación impecable e historia entretenida.
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It was such a beautiful movie.
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Essa Animação é arte 😍
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,An Absolute Cinematic Masterpiece!!!!!

"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Uma das melhores animações já feita
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"For a family film, this long-to-arrive follow up is worth seeing for anyone, and is the highlight of the theatre release season."
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Legitimately super enjoyable.  It was such a pleasant surprise, loved Goldilocks and the bears"
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,The Last Puss in Boots appearance I recall was back when I watched his TV Series on Netflix a few years ago. I decided to try watching this movie since I have good childhood memories of the character. Upon finishing the movie I was immensly pleased as the film was much more better than I expected. Spider Verse comparable graphics and the movie is much more relatable to us in the mental health perspective.
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It was funny. I enjoyed the movie as a whole.
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was so amazing! I didn't really want to watch it due to the fact that the animation seemed very different than the last Puss in Boots and the Shrek movies, I thought it was going to be very cheesy and look cheaply made. I was so wrong! I will definitely watch it over again and I can't wait for the next one!"
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"this movie rocked me to my core.

i went into this expecting a light-hearted shrek-universe kind of comedy packed movie. as the first puss in boots, nothing too serious, nothing too brilliant, but funny enough that it would keep be busy for an hour and a half.

i was gravely mistaken, and i greatly underestimated this film.

it was packed full of comedy, but it was also very serious in the crucial moments that needed it. not only that, but it was absolutely brilliant. everything from the animation and effects to the voice talents, it was quite literally brilliant. on my first watch, i was in a nearly empty movie theatre, save for about 10 other people. and i cried my heart out at 2 very distinct scenes, and then a third time when the lights in the theatre came back on, as i realized that this moment, me enjoying this incredible cinematic experience, was over. so what did i do ? i went back to the theatre two days later and rewatched it. and then i watched it a third time. i watched this movie in theatres three times within the same week. and yes, i cried those other times i watched it too.

i could go on and on about how great this movie is, but i dont want to spoil anything, and id rather people go watch it themselves.

please go see it. you will not be disappointed."
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie's a throwback to when kids movies were good and less shiny
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty good movie. Pushes the line of pg while still keeping it reasonable for a kid to watch. The movie overall has a really good story compared to most and I never got bored enough to touch my phone.
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Super cute movie with a great family message. Can't wait to see it again
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a cute movie with a good message. Definitely a fun watch even as an adult.
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing animation, great songs, and cute to boot."
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic, totally worth the watch. Really proves a movie is only as good as its villain."
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the art and animation of this movie, the way the panic attacks, death, and villains were portrayed beautifully."
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the best movie I've seen in quite a while! Yes, it borrows animation techniques from Into The Spider-verse, but it uses them well to elevate the movie visually. The story is peak, the visuals are peak, there's nothing not to love with this movie."
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"A animação é simplesmente espetacular, o roteiro é bem construído e a animação é muito bem feita ao misturar estilos de desenho, no caso o realista com o cartoonesco, além do mais é primorosa a maneira como temas existenciais são abordados de forma velada e sutil; o contraste entre o riso e o terror, o peso da morte e o valor da vida. Mas falando de maneira mais íntima, essa animação foi especialmente bem sucedida ao me fazer experimentar sensações que não sentia desde a minha infância, talvez pela própria nova abertura da DreamWorks, como também pelo clássico humor de Shrek, enfim, o desenhor é sensacional e muito superior a tudo que a Disney tem forçado e empurrado com a barriga nestes últimos anos."
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Grande jornada! Ótima mensagem! Grande Filme!
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Jack horner me prende
"Jan 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"My son.    A
Loved it. 
Didnt do it for me.   S
But animation and villain portrayal were good."
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Um filme lindo, ótimo para assistir sozinho, em casal, em família, de qualquer jeito!. Filme muito precioso, supera incrivelmente os outros filmes da franquia. Sempre vejo q é difícil fazer continuações tão perfeitas quanto os primeiros filmes, mas essa com certeza supera todos os outros da mesma saga"
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,La trama que te muestra que una vida te da el tiempo suficiente para cumplir tu sueños
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very funny kids movie, but also had some older jokes. Great movie."
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,A colorful cinematic masterpiece with splashes of anime/video game/comic style artistic choices. Has you on the edge of your seat all the time with a magnificent cast with range from despicable to heartwarming characters. Villain of the year. Great message for both adults and children to take to heart. Adult friendly- not at all boring. Perrito isn't a perrito. He a goat.
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Simplemente um dos filmes já feitos
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Extremely hypnotizing and just the psychological inside of the movie film is just perfect everything is just perfect there's no words to describe how well DreamWorks has succeeded this time.
In my 20s I adore it"
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Insanely good animation, great mix of 3d, 2d, 24 fps and 16 fps in fight scenes with very fluid movements, the storyline starts off quite generic but sprouts into something unique and emotional with great and well timed humor. The returning characters are leagues more expressive than their original iterations and the new cast is also well crafted, especially the villain which i (and many others) consider to be the best one ever created by dreamworks, overall an amazing movie which i recommend for the whole family."
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"simplesmente uma das melhores animaçõe que ja vi em muito tempo, personagens marcantes, antagonistas de alto padrão e trama completamente encaixada! uma hora você ri, outra hora você sente medo, e finalmente você chora. parabens dream works."
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best movies of last year i sweat
"Jan 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Um bom trabalho da dreamworks, gosto do personagem."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Went in without having seen the first puss in boots and the Shrek movies not in a couple years. All i have to say is one, you don't really need to have seen anything with Puss in it before this. This movie standalone is a masterpiece. A lot of stuff in it that I am not smart enough to delve into deeply, but I can say as a surface level review after having seen it twice that this movie is amazing."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent film, perhaps not deserving of 5 stars, but these products that do contribute something and are made with love deserve special treatment because there are more and more franchises that only make repetitive and soulless products.  But this film is still obviously made to make a profit like almost everything in this market, it manages to do something that feels special and doesn't neglect things like the characters or the narrative to be much more ""appealing"", aside BROOO THIS FILM IS VISUALLY A CRAZY I LOVE THIS MOVIE"
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Perrito symbolizes the essence of this amazing film.Even without the free sweater and two buddies he would still be a happy-go-lucky pouch.
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is a masterpiece and greatest movie DreamWorks have ever made
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I absolutely loved this movie! I grew up with Puss In Boots first in Shrek 2, but later his own film. I loved how they really made him more relatable, and finally accepted himself and his life. also, Shrek 5, very cool."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was great with great and funny characters, sick animation, and great moments of emotional depth. I realized though the critic and audience scores have gone down slightly so I'm here to help fix that. Please make this a 100% on rotten tomatoes"
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It was much better than I was expecting. It had a good message and it fun to see new and old characters interacting.
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"oh, I got to tell you, it was perfect. Perfect. Everything, down to the last minute details."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"this movie is a love letter to animation, i love everything about it and you can see that every aspect of the movie was made with care and love for the project. I could talk about how the animation is the peak of dreamworks by far but it would be too long, the music is on point, the characters are all interesting, the narrative is captivating and the message gets everyone emotional everytime."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Oh it was fast paced entertainment that my teen daughter, who has grown up watching all of these films, still enjoyed watching along with myself.  I liked how they managed to update the action scenes with more of a manga style animation without going too far.  Puss has his arc and he learns the live in the present and to love and cherish those around him."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie! Wonderful animation!
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Say hello to my Gatito blade!

Edit: On second viewing it is even better. A truly remarkable film."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really didnt expect the movie to be this good. The fact that it had many characters wasnt even bad at all. They were all delivered perfectly and i loved the way the story teaches about morality, trust and family while still being an animated masterpiece .It was just right . I also love how the end fully confirms shrek 5 and after this i dont know what to expect."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,visually amazing. if you're a fan of art/animation you're doing yourself a disservice to not see this multiple times
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie so much! It's a wonderful story that executes its message so well. None of the characters are dull or annoying, every one of them has an interesting personality. It was a beautiful story and amazingly written characters. Loved the anxiety representation in Puss. 10/10 would watch again!"
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muito bom, personagens legais, enredo muito bom, emocionante.
Historia e grafico muito bem feito. 😁👍"
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"In one of the best year for animation, this was one of the best animation last year for a reason. Driven by an amazing art married with one of the strongest writing for the past decade would make this a masterpiece and marvel for those who love this franchise and new to the franchise as it serves a potential cult classic for years to come."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Desarrollo de personajes, animación fantástica, buenos chistes, simplemente es perfecta."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,As a 23 year old this was one of the best movies i have seen in a long time. Highly recommended!
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it, Great example a keeping the Formula that Works"
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the only movies i enjoyed in recent times and the best animated movie i've ever seen. The characters feel alive and do not blend in with one another, they are all memorable. In addition, the story is fantastic and the message it tries and succeeds in conveying is important, both to adult and children. I reccomend watching at the earliest time possible."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't usually rate movies, but this movie was seriously amazing! Death was probably one of the best-developed villains in recent years. The story explores the fear of death and reminds the audience that life is happening now; make the most of it and value the people around you. This movie holds a special place in my heart, story-wise the best movie of the year. Overall, second to Avatar Way of the Water. Anyone that says it's too violent, I disagree. The film balances the realities of life while maintaining a positive and optimistic message."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved every second of it. Perrito and Florence Pugh were my favorite characters.
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Words aren't enough to describe how good this movie is.
"Jan 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Puss In Boots is not for the little ones any longer!  It has grown with my kids.... and no sub titles!  I turn them on for everything now... but lots of Spanish with no translations!
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed the animation in this one, a visually dynamic mix of the expected cgi and a more stylized animation sequencing (a la ""Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse""). The story itself was as good as any in the ""Shrek"" series--cleverly scripted with very funny gags, good storyline, and likable characters."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"For a kids movie, this was spectacular. The characters are all so likable and the visuals were marvelous! The story was really interesting and the way every character had ulterior motives to one another really made the movie rich with suspense. One of THE best Dreamworks movies made."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great caractheres, a good history, lots of action combined with humor... quite the opposite of last Disney disasters like Lightyear and Strange World."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Puss in Boots Last Wish is so refreshing! The villain is astounding and another great work from Dreamsworks
"Jan 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,The cinematography was great but the content was much too violent for young kids.
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,My son enjoyed so much.
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Um dos melhores filmes feitos atualmente, ótimo desenvolvimento de personagens e ótimo vilão"
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I absolutely cannot stress how good this is. The animation style and amazing action had me immersed the entire time, with enticing villains and visuals making the movie a spectacle not soon to be forgotten."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was an amazing experience. The sound, the graphics, the plot of the movie the voices, the heroes, the Villains..... Everything in this movie was amazing. They did an amazing job and i am waiting for the third movie:)"
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,great time! whole family loved it
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,nice movie i enjoyed too much
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good movie with a great storyline. Hints to the older movie but also to the shrek movies. The animation style is very very cool and nicely done, Think of it like Shrek animation style meets Spiderman animation style."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Really a great piece of art and fun
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great visuals, surprisingly mature themes that make it an enjoyable watch even for adults, super cool and intimidating antagonist, while still having plenty of heart and a good lesson at it's core! Highly recommend!"
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the most awesome, animated movies ever! Haven't watched an animated this good in a long time."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome for all ages!
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Whole family well entertained. Good plot. Well dosed food for thought. 
DK Danish voices dos a good job too"
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you loved the art style of ""Into the Spider-Verse"" you're going to love this movie. Amazing story telling, amazing animation, amazing characters all around. A must see for all ages."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"An amazing movie, great plot and by far one of the best villains in an animated film, the kids loved it and so did I"
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Animation lovers this is your thing
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I wish I was lying when I say this is the best movie I've seen in a WHILE. I went with a friend as a joke just hoping for something half-decent and was shocked at how much I genuinely enjoyed it. The animation was beyond incredible, specifically during fight sequences, but also just in general. Dreamworks has been hitting it out of the park recently as far as animation goes and this may be their best yet. I expected a cute but corny kids movie and got a commentary on embracing life in all of its brevity. The protagonist's story line was devastating, the villain was terrifying, I laughed out loud and cried multiple times, and walked out of the theater wanting to be a better person. The visuals, the voice acting, the story line- there's nothing wrong with this movie. I have never called a movie perfect before, but that is exactly what Puss in Boots: the Last Wish is."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I could only watch the movie in 480p, but it looked great even at such low quality. They did fantastic with the writing and brought back the feeling of watching the original Dreamworks' Shrek for the first time when I was a kid."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie. Great characters, side characters and villains were fun to watch, had an impactful story with lots of depth, and animation was absolutely phenomenal."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"this movie is amazing, the art style the world, the music, the characters, the story!!"
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the greatest animated movies of the decade
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"THIS MOVIE IS THE BOMB!! 

For one, this movie handles serious topics such as anxiety and death very maturely and isn't all in your face about. Best of all, it doesn't degrade or ruin the character in any way. It gives actual character development and makes it so relatable to watch!

Two, this movie has great characters with depth and deeper layers that help make them more likable and better to see. For example, Goldilocks wanted a family of her own blood but throughout the film, she realizes that she didn't need a family like that and finally learned a family is connected by love rather than DNA. Now THAT is depth right there!

Three, the animation is amazing. It is so refreshing to see Dreamworks step out of their comfort zone in animation and try a new style to a point where everything is more vivid and colorful instead of the typical semi-realism we see in Dreamworks films.

Four, IT HAS A GREAT VILLAIN! I know it may sound like a not-so-big deal at first but once you really think about, the villain is always the hardest character to write and organize because everyone has a different idea of a villain and how they can give audiences a fearful presence. Well, Death was a perfect example of a villain because he was bigger and felt thrill in being the bigger person and scaring Puss. Plus, his Whistle of Death is terrifying and can absolutely be frightening to both Puss and the audience. The writers also were so good in giving Death a vibe that communicated clearly to the audience that in a way, he was there and he knew that Puss was foolishly wasting his lives. 

Fifth, it gives a fresh breath of air to character tropes that are rarely used today and actually makes them well-written! Jack Horner is a very good example of that because he is a psychopath who is beyond redeeming and chooses to be evil and blunt with his motives instead of relying on a tragic backstory to back him up. That, my friend, is how you make a good unapologetically evil villain. No relatable, no tragedy, just a fun but psychotic villain. 

And finally, the voice acting. I love how Dreamworks actually doesn't rely on famous people to boost their film but rather on them boosting it on honest work and good writing like any decent movie should do. The voice actors/actresses all did an AMAZING JOB in delivering the right presence into each character only seen through concept work, and that my friends, is difficult to achieve so a VERY BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE TO THEM!!!

So overall, this film is amazing, genius and very original and ground-breaking with its mix of animation but maturity and I hope Dreamworks can continue making masterpieces such as this and that these guys are currently celebrating their victory at the box offices! SO PARENTS, KIDS AND TEENS PLEASE WATCH THIS FILM! IT IS GORGEOUS AND SO WELL-WRITTEN!!! I LOVED IT SO MUCH AND VERY MUCH MUST YOU LOVE IT TOO!!! :D"
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie takes everything that was amazing in ""The bad guys"" and somehow makes it all better."

"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I dont have time to write all the good things about this movie.
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"In every sense of the word, this movie is phenomenal! The animation is stellar, the story is simple yet so well executed, the voice acting is so perfect, & the message is a powerful one! If you need something to go see, please go see this. Bring your friends, your family, your partners, just get in there, and celebrate how amazing animation is right now!"
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,death makes this movie
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time and maybe I'm biased because I struggle with my own mortality and death but it does talk about this topic in a way that not only reignited my own passion for life but also covered themes and topics I feel many people can resonate with in a way that is easy to digest and sit with. The animation is beautiful, something I hope Dreamworks carries on for more cartoony movies in the coming years, and is very colorful and atmospheric when it needs to be. The 'bad guys' all correspond with differing antagonist tropes in ways that feel seamless allowing them and their stories to not overlap in ways that feel forced, not to mention we get to see the classic Shrek2-esque spin by taking known fairytales and giving them modern twists. Extremely excited to see where Dreamworks goes from here and with El Gato con Botas."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible eye candy animation combined with fun characters, engaging plot, and surprisingly adult themes. This movie is amazing!"
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,The animation is just simply flawless and also the storyline
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I absolutely loved the message the movie teach us
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just watched puss in boots in theatres and it was very good. y'all should give it a watch. it's very rare to have good movies that aren't ""woke"" and make it absolutely hilarious with a beautiful moral meaning to it! :)"
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a MUST watch for anybody who loves movies with adventure, fantasy, great storytelling, and that satirical DreamWorks humor we know and love!"
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,The story was smooth and put together. The animation style of the fighting scenes where my favorite parts. The choppy look makes it look more intense.
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very fun story with a pretty thoughtful message about desires and mortality. All wrapped in a nice, visually stunning package"
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The characters were loveable and the overall animation and story were perfect. My favorite character was Death, a great message that Puss learns. An excellent movie for the family."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome!! The animation is incredible, the characters are all well thought out and likeable, the pacing is also great. Wonderful, compelling story. Can't wait to see what's next for our favorite fearless hero Puss In Boots!"
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"muy buena pelicula, me diverti bastante, una de las mejores del gato"
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"SENSACIONAL!!!! PARABÉNS DreamWorks 
#AprendeDisney"
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie. I really liked the animation and the artstyle of it. The designs and the personality of the characters where absolutely amazing and the story was also very good. I recommend to watch!
"Jan 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie it's ok, but there are certain scenes between the wolf and the cat that I think are too much for a little kid. 
Every studio that produces films for kids should hire psychologists for analyzing the script so the children are exposed to the kind of content appropriate for their age."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a really good movie. Out of all of the DreamWorks Animation movies that I've seen this one is my favorite. The story is probably a 4 out of 5 to be honest. It's great but not amazing. What really sold me on this movie as being one of my favorites was some of the animation styles that were being used and the dialogue of the characters. During action sequences the animation style seems to have a reduced frames per second that is just visually really stunning. Just a beautiful movie. The dialogue is on par with those of other DreamWorks movies, but this movie was just outstanding when you consider the dialogue. Just a great movie!!"
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"an amazing, fun, melodramatic, and spontaneous heist."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great fun, typical PnB!"
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie has quite a lot of good qualities, namely the plot, the characters, the story, the humour, the visuals... Oh wait, that sounds like everything heh? Well yes, there isnt anything that this movie lacks. Highly reccomend it to everyone, children and adults alike. Its got great humour, both for adults and kids, life lessons that hit hard as a cliff and is, in my opinion, the best movie of the past year."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic! Top 2 movies of 2022-2023!
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story and great finish, loved it, I reccomend!"
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic story, great characters with interesting voices. The visual style was refreshing and beautiful. I was really surprised by the quality of the dialogue and care put into this film."
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I like the way they build the plot and character.
"Jan 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was amazing! I love the story, themes and my god the animation! This had a good story with great themes on mortality and found family. And the animation. I love the 2d and 3d blend and the inspiration from popular media like anime, spider-verse, and Sergio Leone. I love the character of death and that whistle is bone chilling. I am pleasantly surprised that the whistle wasn't a Dies Irae derivative and I kind of like that. This movie is great for all ages and reaffirms that animation is a medium and not a genre. Also the wolf is hot. IDK."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Good plot pacing. A good wrap up for Puss in Boots while leaving the door open for more if needed.
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. I don't go out of my way to see animated movies and I actually enjoyed it. The animation style had something unique about it that I haven't noticed in others before.
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,fun movie and some life lessons!
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,We needed more shriek camo
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,i liked all of it and i loved the easter eggs
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, beautiful message, and fantastic balance of humor, action, and feel good movie."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,What could have easily been a turd was polished incredibly well. I say this because last Shrek movies including 2011 Puss in Boots was mediocre. The directors and writers haven't had many successes in the past either. However this movie demonstrates when a team can come together and see a finish line and genuinely produce something of superb quality. This is a paradigm shift I hope to see if their future films.
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Animação praticamente perfeita!
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"incrivel. Havia tempo que não via uma animação tão boa, e a dublagem incrivel, o roteiro é perfeito, e fora o vilão, um dos melhores da dreamworks."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great pacing and lots of fun for the whole family.  Actually got my 4 yr old to sit through a whole movie!
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie loved the art style
"Jan 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very cringe the only thing about the movie was death 
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I watched this because people were praising the villain and they were right. It wasn't just the villain though, every part of this movie was great."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Puss in boots so coo cool 😭😭😭 Perrito got me dizzy 🥴
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Okay, I understand a few of these mad parents. But there honestly is hardly any violence that is considered PG-13, the art style is better than Arcane. What is wrong with y'all?"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie to see with friends
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I actually enjoyed this movie. I thought it was gonna be bad because I didn't enjoy the first but the characters and creativity are amazing.
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Must see! Great movie, great Gillian's, funny, and an awesome ending!!!"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Took Granddaughter. We both enjoyed the film.
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie I’ve ever seen
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss In Boots: The Last Wish blows Avatar out of the water and it's only an hour long!!! 
I Can Not Stress Enough how much you NEED to see this Movie. Worth buying tickets! 


Our Favorite Fearless Hero Puss (pathetic meow meow, affectionate) is battling the horrors with his besties!
The animation if beautiful, It's Attack on Titan for kids, it's terrifying (in the best way possible), and it's hilarious! Great For All Ages! 
I can't believe Dreamworks has made me excited for Shrek 5. WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie with lots of comedic moments.  Loved the references to fairy tales.
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Very pleasurable movie
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is an absolute masterpiece. 
Like, I aint gon lie. . . however, the movie perfectly contains sum form of social critisism. In the beginning, we can see Puss going to that ol lady and living a normal live, where the lady and the house represent current society and its function to keep its ppl safe, as it is also somehow shown in Hobbes social contract. More over, it shows that living autonomous life means to know oneself and take on burdens n stuff. So we see on that lil map that everyone has to go a diff path, since everyone has to live their own lifes the way it beneftits themselves the most. but what i think makes the movie special, is that ur not alone on youre path and that your path is not always seperate from the others but that there is lots of intersections. 
What i find most interesting about the paths is the goal of it. Youre said to be granted a wish, if u finish ur path. However, what i think the movie ist trying to say is that wishes/short cuts are for lil pussies. The goal of the path is not ur goal, but to find your meaning. The goal of the path is in a sense the beginning of your life. wich can also be seen in puss' path. Theres a stop where he's trapped in that lil hole an with his past lifes and the death. The Station is calles lost souls or smth. U can think that it only means ""lost lifes"" or smth. But i think what the movie is trying to say is that unless you find your own goal in life(reach the goal of the map path thing) ur lost. This is seen by the introduction of death. He said something like puss was hiding from death in more life. From running away ur basically lost, since your life has no meaning. Therefore the goal of this path is to find urselfe and your goal, what u want. Thats why that girl and her bear family had to visit a replica of their old home. 
what fascinates me about that scene is that the map says to look forward.But looking forward shows ur past, meaning that to be able to take steps in life u have to know where u came from and who u are. Thats sum crazy stuff ngl. 
Lastly, I wanna finish of with the Death. Obviously, the coolest character in the film, since he got cool swords and a badass design. However, he is not a acting character in the film, he's just the visualisation of the death. So he doesn't kill, but jus is there to show that death is there(?) if you know what I mean? 
He's the character that said that puss was hiding in life. What I find cool about him is not the usual talk, that u can only worth ur life when u know death. This film is greater than that. It is trying to close the binary between Life and Deaht. It is trying to show us the hierarchy that we've created, that life > death. But dont understand that both live from one another...
So its not that life n death are two different things, but that life inherits death and death life. In the sense that stuffs kinda mixed up: Life isnt just the absence of death. But death is the thing that makes life worth... oh wow ok it is the typical stuff, but i gotta say that the way it was portrayed was super cool. Or maybe it is different. When i watched the film, i remember that i understood it differently. Im sorry Im a lil tired. 
To sum up, films great 10/10"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,3 generations went together. It was just enough kid fun and grown up comedy to keep us all entertained.
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Im a parent that went with my family consisting of kids ages 14, 10 & 5. There are some scenes that may be too scary for younger onesheck, even I was a little frightened at some of the dark elements. Death comes for Puss and does so in a dark and dramatic way. Overall it was a good movie (for this 40 year old) incorporating nursery rhyme stories in a creative way. Puss does say one curse word."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best animated movie since Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse. emotional, beautiful, action packed. It's the best kind of sequel. The ""Shrek 2"", the ""Empire Strikes Back"" kind of sequel."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, all the kids loved it!"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Very fun very funny very nice. saw it twice and cried both times
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The animation was amazing
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best Puss in Boots movie to date, the animation was amazing, the art was amazing, and the storyline was even better."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"As someone who deals with anxiety every day, this movie didn't just hit home with me, it dragged me into my bedroom and beat the living soul out of me. The animation is stunning, and the art style is somehow better than the Dreamworks movies before it. The story has an excellent execution, with a hilarious main villain and a terrifying force of nature that's the very symbol of death. the main cast are enjoyable to watch as they make their way through the plot. One of the characters was surprisingly enjoyable since they first seem like they'd be an annoying comedy relief, only to be one of the best characters.

Overall, I'm going to watch this as many times as I've seen Shrek and Shrek II with just how good this movie is. This is the second best sequel Dreamworks has ever produced."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best villain of all time, and also the best animated movie since Intro the Spiderverse. It's up there with all the other Dreamworks masterpieces such as HTTYD and The Last Guardians"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hilarious but serious when it needed to be serious. I didn't watch the original Puss in Boots and I've forgotten the plots of the Shrek sequels, but it was enjoyable and not confusing at all. You could take your kids to see this without having to rent the entire Shrek franchise for them beforehand. I like how the animation was more cartoony, stepping away from the uncannily realistic style of past Shrek movies. The voice acting was also great. Every character has a pretty distinct accent but not to the point where it feels mocking or grating, and the celebrity voice actors don't feel like they're just there to pull in a bigger audience. The theme of the movie, that we can't escape from death but shouldn't spend every moment fearing it, is something I needed when I was younger. Too many family movies are afraid to talk about death, so I enjoy the recent trend in animation where this topic is thoroughly addressed instead of avoided. Overall, a great movie made with heart, and a sequel that isn't a soulless cash grab."
"Jan 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Enjoyed the Movie it was funny and both kid friendly
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,it was really good and death was just a top tier villain
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was pretty hesitant at first to watch the movie only because I didn’t really care about Puss in Boots character but after seeing reviews about the movie me and my girlfriend said “Screw it, let’s watch it!” I don’t know Where to even begin or summarize how I felt about the movie but it was AMAZING! From start to finish I was hooked. From the villian to the character development to the plot! Everything was just so fresh and spot on. I never wrote a movie review, this is actually my first but I just had to review it and rate it. Definitely one of my favorite animation movies of all time! This is coming from a person that usually falls asleep halfway into movies, I was fully awake for every scene from start to finish. A DEFINITE must watch!"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I pirated this movie, and found it so good that I made a Rotten Tomatoes account purely to give something back to this absolute gem of a film. Enough said, really."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Genuinely one of the best movies I have ever watched loved every second of this film the music was amazing it was really funny it makes you feel for characters it and the animation is amazing and all the characters are awesome highly recommend seeing this movie if you haven't already to see your favorite fearless hero puss in boots
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"As an incredibly stressed out college student, I was hesitant to go to a late night showing of this movie with my roommate, but I have been OBSESSED ever since. I bought it to watch at home and have watched it every day since just in the background. Cute cat running from death and 3 cute bears = happy college kid. Idk how to write reviews but I ADORE this movie"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,esse filme e muito bom e engraçado e as partes em que aparece o lobo quando ele assovia da uma arrepiada esse filme tá otimo
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was brilliant! As far as villains go, the Big Bad Wolf is probably going to be considered one of the most iconic Dreamworks has ever created!"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The kids loved the movie but were we watched it was not the best, yet it was still a great movie!"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Took my 8 year old grandson to Puss in Boots, he loved it and said it was amazing. I loved the message and the moral of the story."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Didn't like the main bad guy but overall it was great
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was cute, witty, and the animation was excellent.  A possible downside may be that you might have to be of a certain age to ""get"" all the references."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,There was no dull moments in this movie it kept me wanting to watch all the way through
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Fresh and fun . We loved it !
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It was fun and entertaining
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme tem uma ótima história com ótimos vilões
Personagens bons o filme faz nao conseguimos tirar o olho da tela e etc o filme foi uma obra de arte espero que tenha uma continuação que explore mais os personagens mas o filme é 5 estrelas"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Surprisingly delightful entry in the franchise thanks to a superb vocal cast, rich story and gorgeous animation.  Antonio Banderas remains superb in the title role, this time giving a rich performance as Puss is now in fear of death despite years of heroics.  He is matched by the rest of the cast, particularly Selma Hayek at Kitty Softpaws and Florence Pugh as Goldilocks.  Behind the camera, directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado direct a rich story dealing with death and what it means to live.  They also use the allegory of a wish effectively, showing how all those seeking it already have what they want already if they would just look for it.  It is matched by some gorgeous animation, blending CGI with 2D in a brilliant way, making for some fantastic action and set pieces.  All in all, a fantastic film and one of the best of 2022."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Easily the best animated movie of the year. The story  is surprisingly mature, with Puss struggling with his  mortality and it's not shying away from shocking scenes or heartwrenhing moments. The animation is stellar, Spiderverse's influence on modern animation is nothing other than magical. Plus the movie is really funny just like you would want it it from a Shrek movie! I'd say, this is the best movie in the Shrek saga since Shrek 2. And I can't wait for more of the franchise in the future."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"""it was perfect, perfect, down to the last minute details""-Homelander"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Here it is, the masterpiece I've been waiting for the last few years. Finally, someone reminded the giant studios how movies are made. The animation is incredible. DreamWorks decided to change the style of the cartoon for the better and they succeeded. The comic book style of ""Spider-Man: Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" and a bit of anime animation wink at the cat. The cartoon has enough morals. So you will have a lot to think about after watching it. And the main antagonist is one of the best antagonists in cartoons in general. His movements, look, and charisma make you scared. The sequel does not depend on the events of the first part and the series of Shrek cartoons. It tells a new story on its own, about a well-known fairy-tale character who, having spent his 8 lives, is afraid to lose his last one, running away from death itself. Visually, the cartoon is bright and fabulous. It was very unexpected that the director of the failed projects Trolls and The Croods: A New Era"" Joel Crawford, was able to make this masterpiece and wipe Disney's nose. So I recommend it to everyone."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just saw this movie yesterday with my friend and it's awesome! Everything from the writing, to the visuals, to the voice acting was great and you could tell the movie had a lot of heart put into it. I highly recommend this movie to everyone, but would also like to point out that if you're a parent trying to find a fun movie to watch with your kids, this is def the movie to pick. It's written really well overall and got a lot of jokes that adults will like too (while still being appropriate for children ofc). It's honestly probably one of the best kids movies I've seen in a while, so yea."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Haven't seen an animated movie I wanna watch again the day after since I was a kid.

How DreamWorks cross old fairtales in such ways with modern takes along with references, and details to other figures or movies makes it only more interesting to look around to see what's going on in the background as well.

Great for all ages."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Really sweet and hilarious.
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Perfection...The voice acting , animation , characters and character devolepment was insane but best of all the villians and especially death  And I don't mean it metaphorically, or rhetorically, or poetically, or theoretically, or any other fancy way.
death straight up

but no im being for real here this movie is a 10/10"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The previous PIB movie was kinda boring for me. But this lastest one must be one of the GREATEST movies of dreamworks.
"Jan 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not bad, not great. Had its moments"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pretty good movie, kept me entertained."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Literally the first movie I've ever rated on here, but I had to because it is so good in so many ways. Touching, deep, funny, impactful, well written and character driven. Seriously amazing"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm 19 years old, going on 20. I went to go see this film with my mother and my sister with her 3 year old son who loves Puss in Boots. I am pretty sure I was much more interested and invested into this movie than my nephew. 

It was actually really good. I do still like animated content, such as Arcane, Invincible, Into the Spiderverse, etc, as well as things you'd consider for a kid like Kung fu panda (I love those movies), and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish really takes it home."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"A pesar que es una pelicula hecha para niños trasciende con las enseñansas que da , desde el desarrollo de la trama que sin dar spoilers nos podriamos identificar de cierta manera con el protagonista , bajo las situaciones que plantea hasta la forma en como los personajes de apoyo son tan unicos a su manera , y sin dejar a lado el excelente trabajo que hace el antagonista que solo de recordar me deja con los pelos de punta ......."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the cinematic masterpieces by Dreamworks. Great character development for Puss. Immersive action scenes. Magnificent camerawork. Just..absolute (chef's kiss). Character design is goddamn. The illustrations are so good too. I just-- damn.

My absolute favourite part of the movie was when Puss had a disagreement with his past 'souls'. You can see his distinctive personality change; he's still Puss, but wiser. Also, should I elaborate on how much I love the Wolf? He's such a remarkable character amongst all Dreamworks characters. There are multiple messages conveyed, plus the executions on the delivery are subtle and ""just right"". There are some predictable cliche tropes/plots at some turns but they are done ""just right"" as well by Dreamworks; tbh I'm fine with it. I also love how Dreamworks started to produce such gorgeous movies ever since the phenomenal Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. All in all, I'm looking forward to more great movies by Dreamworks."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,una pelicula muy buena
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie just didn’t know the seat would be so close together did not like that at all
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The animation? PERFECT!!! The way I cried? WORTH IT!!!! I love this movie to bits and pieces, I wish I was a cat right meow."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"An unexpected masterpiece of storytelling and animation, sequel to otherwise pretty forgetable entry in Shrek franchise, it catapults itself alongside Shrek 2 among greatest animated movies of all time.This movie has everything, amazingly written characters, breathtaking animation, sound design, it's just a treat to see in all aspects. Voice acting also deserves a praise, especially Antonio Banderas, 
who delivers the most multilayered and complex take on this character yet. 
Very strongly recommend."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It was so funny and cute at the same time
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautifully rendered, strong performances, well-written, funny and fun."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Let's just say that this movie is everything that Disney is NOT - and that's precisely why it's so great. Highly recommend!
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,it was really good 10/10
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Every character was awesome, the storytelling was phenomenal, plot was amazing, and it was outright hilarious. Definitely a heartfelt movie, because we all have wishes, and some don’t get to come true. But there’s always a lesson to learn. 10/10, well done!"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love this movie, it's so good it's one of the best movies in the shrekverse by far and has one of the best villas ever 10/10"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,A great movie that's shows if you mess around with life you can die with the best villain I have ever seen in a kids movie!
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I totally love this movie. Had my heart pumping to the very end. Glorious job to DreamWorks. 👍
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was simply amazing, the caracters, the writing, and the wolf, the wolf ahhhh.
It's definitively a must see."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Legendary, really good movie"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,THIS MOVIE GIVES A CLASS ON HOW TO TREAT FANTASY MOVIES...A MASTERPIECE
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The younger audience that watches this is definitely gonna remember Lobo as a core memory
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely loved it! the comedy was great and the message we pretty cool. Cliche but good 👍
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Very funny and imaginative. There was a real sense of integrity with the story telling and art direction.
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme engraçado com cenas de ação muito boas, otimo pra toda a família"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"So out of the box, the characters are awesome, the story is amazing and the setting is so creative. I recommend it 100%. I watched the movie with my girlfriend in a cinema full of kids, but at the end we were almost crying!"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It was funny and suspenseful
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Expected to be mildly entertained and maybe catch a short nap. It was fantastic! Might go see it again!
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a master piece, best animation of 2023 so far!!"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"very good movie, went with my 2 daughters and 2 granddaughters, we all loved it !"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Literally in my 20s and I've seen this movie twice in theaters already. My 16 year old sister and I are considering seeing it for a third time. I have zero complaints. I have no idea how this movie has anything less than 5 star reviews. I'm convinced some people are just not fun tbh.
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hilarious movie, loads of funny moments and lovable characters"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,This was an absolutely great movie. The best I've seen in several years. Anyone who thinks otherwise can suck suck my big toe
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It was action the kids like and great lesson in the end. The effects were great.
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie. Great message and moral. Way better than what Disney has been putting out lately.
"Jan 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fun movie. I wouldnt recommens it to young kids though they would get scared of the Wolf in the film. The humor was funny and I liked the story and the animation. Funny characters especially the dog.
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was phenomenally good! Main antagonist was portrayed so well. Had many funny moments and character development was well progressed. Overall this movie is great for all ages to enjoy!
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than I thought it would be
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything about this movie was masterful. I loved the plot twisted and the life lessons. Definitely gonna be watch this a million times
"Jan 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Just wasn't as good as the first one. Lacked the humor and was just a bit boring.
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Me llevé una grata sorpresa con esta película. La animación es perfecta. 🥰
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Art, please go watch this movie if you have not already. I won't say much here in terms of plot but this movie is really carried by the characters and tones presented throughout. The main antagonist is up there with the best dreamwork villains of all time, like the Fairy God Mother."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,a real representation of an anxiety attack
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is near perfection, and you absolutely must see it. Don't pirate it; it is without a doubt worth your money, and I'm not even exaggerating. You can ask this to basically anyone who watched the film, and their answer will probably be the same."
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It was fantastic give it two boots up!
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"A melhor animação da DreamWorks, o filme da profundidade aos personagens de uma maneira única, além de trazer coisas importantes que a sociedade passar como , a morte, crises de ansiedade, ter um motivo pra viver , isso e muito lindo de se ver , eu amei o filme em todo momento"
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,GOATED MOVIE ON FOENEM
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,fun movie great addition to the Sherek franchise and beautiful animation
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,i love it ! The cuteness and silly parts of it.🥹😆😍
"Jan 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It was so good and impactful and worth the watch you dont gotta watch any of the shreks or even pussin boots one it is a stand alone masterpiece
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Very funny and amazing animation. One of the best movies of this year so far
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautifully told story with good message, good acting and looks gorgeous. It lacked a bit of polish in the low-framerate area but overall an amazing movie."
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,one of the best DreamWorks films that I ever saw
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you love animated movies - this is a must see.  The different styles and techniques play out beautifully and although a bit of a cliche in storytelling for adventure / quest movie, it was still a well spent 100 or so minutes."
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best 2023 annimated movie so far, with a great story and narrative. The characters just went amazing just like the graphic annimation itself. I really like the way this movie has adults and childrens as main target.Not changing the insence of the characters and making amazing new ones,  that's what leades a movie to success! I highly recomend to watch!"
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"All i can say is wow!!! The ending was amazing, it leaves you knowing that the story continues! 

I was a little worried given the last Shrek movies being sub-par, while the first Puss In Boots was great! 

So after seeing this, Dreamworks definitely did a great job!"
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,A great movie to watch with family and friends
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't think what I say will do justice to how good this movie is, it's a film that children can enjoy and adults can cry, literally the best movie I saw in my whole life. This is one of those movies that will be seen 50 years after its release and who watch it, will think it's a wonderful movie, it's an instant classic that everyone should watch at least once in their life. Oh, and just one thing, if you haven't watched it yet, try to avoid spoilers and stop reading these commentaries about the movie, even if you don't care about spoilers, just trust me and go watch it right now."
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It made me cry. twice
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was fantastic.  Humor,  drama, fun all the way around. A must see. Very re-watchable. Could be a new classic."
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,It was fun my kids enjoyed
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"funny, not too childlike type of humor older kids/teens and adults will laugh at the movie too. awesome animation to watch so many cool tiny details and very 3D like"
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing animation, beautififul character designs, a must see for any lover of art.

If the drawings don't fascinate you enough, there's also: lovable characters, funny writting, great casting and a fast pace plot that absorbs you.

It also has a really good range of antagonists"
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Way better than the first
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Une masterclass. Les personnages, l'histoire, tout est incroyable. Mais le méchant.... au dessus de tout."
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story line and animation. Highly recommended
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Seriously the best movie from the last two months. As usual amazing story and deliver a laugh almost throughout the film. Refreshing and will definitely make it worth the time. A must-watch for everyone!
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it.  Well designed plot and good messages.  Loved the little dog Burrito
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is perfect, 10/10, the animation is perfect, the topics are good, best movie ever 👌"
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! My 9 and 16 year old loved it! Love the ending.
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Never have I seen a movie portray anxiety and fear in such a realistic and immersive way. As a 17 year old who struggles with anxiety, I must say it resonated with me in a way I was not expecting. It far surpassed my expectations for both a kids and an Illumination movie. Could not recommend it more! 
I find that it suits both children and adults, we all struggle with something and this movie helps validate that. Though very young children may not be able to understand the main message. Side note: The new animation is great, the colours blend so beautifully and everything feels more cartoony and exciting."
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"The sequel turned out to be the same as Puss in Boots: risky, but able to win success. This is one of the best animation sequels of all time, everything is perfectly calibrated in it: from the absence of plot holes or their explanation, to the disclosure of characters, graphics, sound design. I really liked that all the references are unobtrusive. Except, of course, the scene after the ending, but it was made that way on purpose. 10/10, absolutely nothing to complain about. This kind of event rarely happens."
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best animated movie I've seen in a long, long time and that's coming from a diehard Disney fan. We brought my daughter for her 6th birthday and she couldn't stop giggling, talking about it and saying it was the best day ever. I agree the movie really did a fantastic job and moved me to tears multiple times. Nothing cheap or too easy in terms of jokes and I liked the pop culture Easter eggs too."
"Jan 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Swedish!
Den var väl okej, det fanns helt klart karaktärsutveckling och svårigheter att övervinna vilket gör att man lätt engagerar sig i filmen och hejjar på rätt karaktärer.
Det som drog ner det för mig var lite väl många och fåniga övernaturliga grejjer samt en del plot holes. 
Betyget 7 av 10 tycker jag dock är bra, värd att ses."
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,over all I think it was really good a great movie for kids and adults alike.
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. Good storyline.
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"THE BEST VILLAIN IN THE ENTIRE ANIMATION  WORLD. I LOVE IT SO MUCH 
W DREAMWORKS"
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Nice and funny, you can watch it with kids and still enjoy it!"
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Mano,filme muito bom, animação boa,o roteiro muito bem feito, nostalgia cara é muito bom desse filme,e o final quando revelam o próximo filme da DreamWorks,o Shrek 5, assitam não vão se arrepender"
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,animacja 9/10 główny zły 10/10 ulubiona postać śmierć/wilk główny bohater 10/10   overall 10/10 zajebisty film polecam :u
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The entire story from start to finish was great. From character development to the journey of each character was great. Highly recommend anyone to watch it.
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,muito bom bom bom bom
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme incrível, trouxe de volta o alto padrão desse universo e acrescentou ainda mais, com a animação muito bonita e a aposta certa na modernização."
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Surprisingly, very good as both a sequel to the first film and the franchise. Funny and yet very mature so that both kids and adults alike will understand. 100% recommend for the whole family to watch and enjoy"
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,a spectacular and funny movie with beautiful art style.
"Jan 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"the story got a bit confusing and the adventure was mixed up in my head. but it was nice to see all of these characters battle. AND DEATH. DEATH IS AWESOME. every time i hear his whistle I just want to yell out: ""HES HERE""! and then scream."
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"DreamWorks knows how to make a movie and sequels. This movie had a lot of real-life meanings and for adults a lot of can actually relate to this movie. On the surface it's a great movie of course for kids. Below the surface, it's a great life lesson all packed in 1 hour and a half."
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"best movie in the shrek universe, and best villain too! 
what a great movie!!!"
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,What a wonderful movie. It was a delight to watch. It was fun and a visual spectacle  throughout the movie. Banderos and Hayek were perfect voices for the main characters. All the voice actors were good. If you want to watch a movie that is clean of woke and adult content this is the movie for you. There are very few movies that keep me smiling from beginning to end. Enjoy.
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,God i love the movie so much! I must say the whistlening kinda scared me
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Very cute movie with a message. It was funny too.
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The animation is such high quality and death is the greatest villain of all time for kids movie. 100% must see!!
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beat animarían movie of the Year, and in general one of the beat movies of the Year. It is an awesome experience for kids and adults, with a great story and good character development."
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is top tier Dreamworks! Easily the 2nd best movie in the Shrek franchise!

The comedy, action and animation style are what sets this movie apart from any other average 'babysitting' movie!

Impressively there are some moments of real dread and the build of of suspense is done very well! 

An amazing cast really helps here too! Nobody is phoning it in! Very good performances from Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek!"
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"As the movie has relied heavily on word-of-mouth, I went into the theatre expecting a lot. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish delivered above and beyond my expectations with it's trademark self-aware humor dating from the Shrek franchise that has kept up with the times. 
However, what makes the movie a stellar contribution to cinema is the way it was able to, through its surprisingly imperfect hero, communicate mental health topics to viewers of all ages, and, in a 102-minute format, present a character arc of a depth and significance somewhere between Zuko (ATLA) and Wolverine (Logan).
An amazing achievement at reviving and modernizing a beloved franchise by DreamWorks and an absolute must-see."
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I remember watching the first one and totally forgot what it was about by the time this movie came out. Didn't have any high expectations at first and wow was I in for a surprise. This film is my all-top favorite of 2022. The animation, the story, the characters. Nothing seemed shoehorned here. Even the Spanish lines --which I have little knowledge of -- didn't detract from my experience, but rather added to it. This _is_ a Spanish-based fairytale, so it makes sense. For me, the main villain in this film is the protagonist himself. Puss' own arrogance catches the attention of our supposed villain, Death disguised as the Big Bad Wolf, who gives Puss a ""boot"" of reality and makes him realize that he squandered his past 8 lives. The film does a great job of evoking fear every time Death appears on screen. The movie also tends to very effectively tug at your heartstrings here and there. One such moment is towards the end when Baby Bear thanks his sister Goldilocks for saving his life, and afterwards when they all give a heartwarming family hug. My favorite character has to be Perrito. He isn't exactly your average comic-relief as the film superbly depicts him as a supportive sidekick. He's an extremely likable character. Great, great film overall. I hope this does well in the box office because I would certainly like to see more subsequent films in this series!"
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"O Filme É Muito Bom! Imagens, Roteiro, Começo, Meio E Fim. Nada Deixa A Desejar. Tudo Tem Um Sentido, Bem Amarradinho - Sem Contar Q Tem Mais Aventuras, Núcleos E Ação - Muito Bom Mesmo!"
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie would be cash-grab (or bad) at first, but I underestimated it by so many levels. The story, the characters, and themes/morals were exellently executed!

The main characters felt alive, to me, but Puss' extreme fears of death felt absolutely real, and perfectly captures the main themes of this movie; Mortality and Death, stating that ""Death and mortality is something no one can ever escape from, but living to fullest and cherishing every moment in life will be worth it.""

Not just that, but talk about the animation style. Heavily inspired by ""Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018)"", but made into something of their own, super awsome, super dynamic, and very cartoony.

One of the best movie to emerge from 2022, high-recommendation"
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie in the shrek universe (in my opinion) I expected this movie to be awesome because the first one was awesome and it was 10 times better than my expectations.
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"It has great visuals, a great story, super great character development. I LOVE IT."
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Puss in Boots: The Last Stand""! The animation was top-notch and the characters were likable and well-developed. The story was engaging and kept me on the edge of my seat. The humor was spot-on and had me laughing out loud. Overall, a great addition to the ""Puss in Boots"" franchise. Highly recommend it!"
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,you're laughing and then you're crying and then you're laughing. favorite movie ever
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I’m going to rate 5 stars because I LOVE SHREK AND PUSS IN BOOTS, HOWEVER, 1) this movie was a bit drawn out and 2) definitely more catered for kids versus Shrek adults who come back for the more adult jokes and themes, which this movie lacked. Very cute movie though overall, I just probably would not watch again."
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,AMAZING LOVE IT SO MUCH!!
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"it's really good, i recommend it"
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"This Movie is super good, like really good. I love when these sort of ""kids Movies""
show respect to there audience Witch they don't really do anymore. this movie has reminded me of why I fell in love with the Shrek Franchise.

  This movie teaches kids about Death and how its not a joke and to live your life with your friends and family. This movie is full of character development from puss being a cocky hero who doesn't fear anything to a hero who learned that life is not a toy. this movie is really good for kids to watch and learn about life and death and to respect it.
  Going into the theater I was expecting a fun movie i knew it was going to be good but not as good as it was I genuinely watched this movie like 5 times scene I first saw it in theaters over 2 weeks ago. 
  this movie is really funny, I'm a person who likes dark humor and this movie was full of it and I'm just glad this movie exists 
  The only reason this movie isn't a 5 out of 5 is because i think the movies passing was to fast and I wish it was longer. I don't advise bringing like 6 year old's younger to go because this movie can be scary at times."
"Jan 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,They tried too hard for laughs. The story felt all over the place.
"Jan 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was horrible, overrated for the other reviews and corny ash. Rushed story line and weird ending. How can the bad guy want to kill the protagonist and just stop seconds before killing him and say he's a cool dude. Doesn't add up. Weird movie. Wasted 2 hours and about $25"
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,So funny!  Enjoyable for bigger kids and parents!  Might be too scary for kids ages 7 & under.
"Jan 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The boys loved it. Especially, the graphics."
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is fun and emotion. Get to watch with the family. The main theme of the movie is everything is just right. In the beginning of the movie Puss Says that he doesn't fear death but he does when he was on his last life. At the end he found that he just needs have the things that love and appreciate and live to the fullest.  I heard that the movie related to people. Overall the movie is great and heart worming.
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,all of it great story
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,WHO IS YOUR FAVORITE FEARLESS HERO
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,So so so incredible oh my gosh. The animation was so breathtaking and invigorating. The fight scenes were spectacular. The story was so solid but most importantly the comedy was INCREDIBLE. When I tell you this movie is Funny it is FUNNYYYYY. ABSOLUTELY a must watch.
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,This is one of the best movies of 2022! The animation quality and quick wit will leave you laughing and sometimes even crying in this action packed animated adventure.
"Jan 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good kids movie but some scary characters
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I cant say anything  ;)
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,This was the best animated movie to come out in a long time. Had a genuinely great time watching with my girlfriend in theaters. Very nice animations and colors. Lovable characters and a dope ass villain. 10/10
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well written story, something fresh and not a rip off of Lion King or Avatar the Last Airbender."
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Top 3 best animated movies ever, easily. So much character and effort here, just a really great movie anyone can enjoy."
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,A animação é muito boa.
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is a must for sure
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Simply amazing. The animation and visuals are simply eye-catching along with pleasant voice-acting, spanish and musical choices of the score! 

The movie's plot is also very well written and doesn't just throw the most brain-dead antics to progress because of ""we're just writing for kids""."
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,This film was adorable and funny humor for all ages included!
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,simplesmente perfeito do inicio ao fim vc quer ação tem vc quer drama tem vc quer emoção tbm tem
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,My boys thought there were lots of funny moments. It had a great underlying message about the importance of friends and family.
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of Dreamworks's absolute best movies ever: gorgeous storybook illustration style animation, really cool action, emotionally engaging characters, and one of the greatest villains to grace an animated feature ever make this one of the best of the decade so far. A must watch for animation fans, and a great time for a family outing. Would highly recommend."
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,loved the characters the animation was beautiful. great story.
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Boa animação, bons personagens, história cativante, comédia certeira, mensagem previsível porém boa, final um pouco previsível mas ainda sim muito criativo e com mais uma mensagem, um romance fofo embora um pouco rápido e forçado, porém o filme consegue compensar com o carisma em seus personagens, e a junção da animação 3D com um ""stop motion"" animado deixa o filme com um aspecto mais confortável."
"Jan 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Worth watching! Fun storyline!
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Melhor filme. Trata de assuntos profundos de uma maneira muito linda que muitas vezes te fazem chorar. A cena do ataque de pânico principalmente foi retratada de uma maneira que realmente te fazia sentir o desespero dele.  O filme também tem muitos momentos engraçados ou só felizes em geral que te fazem abrir um sorriso. E os momentos de ação são dinâmicos e te fazem você se sentir desesperado  e animado. Tudo nesse filme é perfeito, equilibrando a tristeza, a felicidade e o medo. Além de passar uma mensagem linda de amizade e enfrentar seus medos. Já assisti duas vezes e assistirei de novo quando sair nos serviços de streaming. Assistam!"
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,I love the movie sooo mudah <3
"Jan 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"movie good, movie cat, movie boot, movie cat in boot, discord mod, discord mod bad, cat fight discord mod, discord mod bye bye, happ cat, good movi"
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fucking amazing. This is a must watch at as early of an age as possible. I wouldn't recommend it for kids under about age 5, but it tackles issues that more kids should know about."
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This really is a movie for all and not just kids. Its villain was really terrifying with the use of the design of character and noice effects. Overall a funny, heart wrenching, and scary movie."
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was funny and entertaining while also teaching your little ones life lessons such as the importance of family and trust!
"Jan 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Didn't care much for the plot but great animation (ABSOLUTE FIRE), great villain, and this movie is a great example of why Pixar is lagging behind."
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"GREAT MOVIE! It's so refreshing to see a movie with so much love and passion put into it, especially with the half-assed remakes we've been getting for the past few years from other studios."
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Cute and heart-warming story.  Did not like the shifts in animation style though.  Too CGI.
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,best animation of 2022
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Cute, funny, loved the characters. A little dark for a kids movie."
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,So cute and so much fun!
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It definitely has touched my heart, love the ending"
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went in watching this not with low expectations but I thought it would be an average animated movie.... 

but MY LORD this movie was good, literally perfect, and the new art style in this sequel is so refreshing, modern but keeps the nostalgia I get from dream works movies

10/10"
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed my experience at this movie. For those of us growing up with the franchise I feel like this spoke to some very critical mental health themes with class. The world was fleshed out, and the character development was sincere. I was surprised by how much I loved this movie!!! "
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Cute movie. Grandkids loved it!
"Jan 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I watched this movie based on the incredible response it got online, and while this movie is definitely a good kids movie I have heard that it is also a movie adults could appreciate. Yes the ""main"" villain was interesting and (I put quotes there because even though he was technically the main villain he had much less screen time than other characters who were also villains) was fun to watch, he wasn't in the movie a lot. As a kids movie though it is very good and I'm sure kids will love it, anyone trying to compare to other movies that border adult/kids animation I would say is good but I would wait for it to go online to watch."
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,The animation was fantastic the villain death was great he's not really a villain a death is a force of nature.The only reason why death came for puss in boots was to teach him humility.puss in boots teaches us that no matter how much of a big shot you think you are there's always going to be someone or something above you.
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun Story about Second chances and friendship
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful story brought together, teaching a variety of life lessons worth the watch"
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's honestly one of the best movies I've ever watched. I love how all the characters have an actual personality and their different traits are portrayed so well. The animation style is very fitting. I liked to see the 'fearless hero who laughs at death' make the realization that they aren't immortal. Something about this movie just had such a strange affect on me, a positive one."
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Um ótimo filme sem muitos clichês
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the first movie was ""meh. okay."" so I was expecting a fun-yet-mediocre sequel that hopefully wasn't too cringy. My mistake... this is one of those movies where the sequel is so much better than the original, and I loved everything about it. The updated animation style is awesome, the characters are all endearing and interesting (even the ones I thought would be annoying turned out to be great), the story is engaging and well written - and can I just say, both villains in this movie are incredible. A movie about heroes needs good villains, and where so many recent movies have failed, this movie succeeds big time. 

I was a bit nervous when I realized they were starting to follow the Marvel formula of ""chase the glowy-thing"" - but I ended up loving the concept of the Star Map and the deeper meaning it had towards revealing character motivations without every little thing having to be spelled out in an exposition dump. Simply brilliant storytelling. 

Animation continues to be one of my favorite mediums for storytelling. Maybe because it always feels more thought out. Maybe because the blend of humor, heart, and action, is more seamless in animation. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish truly stands out as spectacular, and I highly recommend it."
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Elite animated movie for all ages
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing animation style!
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is such a great movie movie with such good qualities like:
•Great animation and sometimes animates on two for the style
•Amazing story and had me chuckling throughout
•The amazing characters that look way better and I love the new characters! 
Summary:
This is a Absolute MUST WATCH for anyone even for teens and adults!"
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The film is a representation that with the past of time Follows the most faithful of all films the passing of time showing that not everything is fantasy, rather the adventure of the Reality of our lives and transcendence"
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Vaya grata sorpresa que me llevé el año pasado con esa película.
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved it the main villain was so terrifying to the point it didn't feel like a dreamworks movie! I'm also surprised that an animated movie like this would involve topics such as Anxiety and Death, I would love to rewatch this movie again."
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was very funny, silly, yet enduring. Absolute slapper of a film."
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,So beautiful movie with nice messages of friendship I love it !!!  I recommend 100% beautiful is Spanish sounds excellent
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This Movie has some of the best writing, voice acting, animation and story structure I've seen in a long time, a must see"
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually, a very beautiful movie! I really enjoyed the punchy action sequences as well. They dropped the frame rate for some of Puss battles and it makes for a very comic-book feel, like Into the Spiderverse.

The story had a good balance between cute, fairytale whimsy and stakes that felt real. I think this movie did a much better job than most other childrens movies with themes about death, trust, and the idea that love is what makes life worth living. The characters were also very well-done and I enjoyed the introduction of several new characters (which were, really, new faces put to old characters) 

Honestly, I would love to see Dreamworks make more fairytale spin-offs. I dont say this lightly: Puss in Boots: The Last Wish has restored my trust with their ability to make the next Shrek an enjoyable story!"
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Apenas perfeito. Cada cena, cada momento. Perfeito."
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"marvelous movie, amazing development, values, script i see no flaws in this movie, it was perfect"
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Very enjoyable movie.  Sat down with the family and the kids loved it.
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"When i saw there was a sequel released to 'Puss in boots', i didnt think much of it, just like many other people (i assume at least). Man was this movie a HUGE surprise and honestly a fantastic expierence. The first is the visuals, wich are obviously fantastic, with inspirations from Spider Verse and a continuation of what Bad Guys first looked like. The colors pop and Puss looks better than ever before. The story is mainly about how puss has selfishly gone trough 8 of he's 9 lifes (how clever honesly) and now puss must take good care of his last live. This makes for a great foundation for character growth, and boy does he get trough that, mainly with the help of Death (yes, the litteral characterisation of the death) who is a wolf who follows puss around, making him nervous and anxious everytime he does hes signiture wistle. With other fairytales and nursery rhymes like goldilocks and the three bears and the main villian jack horner, everyone wants to have a map that leads to one wish wich can be whatever you want. We also see the return of kitty softpaws, who also get more development than ever. With the two main characters and the addition of perrito, wich is a lovely, way to optimistic dog serving as a great friend and character, they all fight for that last wish. I wont spoil the ending, but that might geniunely be one of the best endings ever to a film. This is a great movie that talks about important topics such a trauma, trust issues and the realisation you also one day will die, and that that thought is okay to have sometimes. A movie that has so little wrong that i cannot think of a single thing that geniunely bothered me or limited the expierence. Truly a near perfect movie, and that is insane to think about, but i am really happy that it is."
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just saw the puss in boots movie and absolutely loved it. The animation, visuals, soundtrack, themes and story just perfectly coincided with each other and was just *chef kisses*. Didn't expect them to have a little teaser at the end, so can't wait for what they have in store next. Solid 5/5 stars."
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,this is a fantastic movie I would give it a 99% rotten tomatoes as the animation style is the best I have in a few years I would say it is on the levels of Shrek 2 and Death is the best villain of all time even Darth Vader does not come close sorry that was a tangent. Anyways I really love the way that they did not kill death oof as they realized this potential I really love the character of the charming team friendship and I also loved the ending for the 3 bears and goldilocks the last wish map and the idea is also very innovative from what I know I personally and in my opinion the best animated film of 2022
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful animations, characters charisma and heartwarming story. It makes you reflect on your happiness, problems and the way you deal with it. I highly recommend!"
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Such an enjoyable movie. Never a dull moment for me. I enjoyed the first movie but this one really went above and beyond.
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Fucking fantanstic 😍
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was just plain awesome.
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Cried laughing in the theatre, gorgeous animation, amazing characters, action that keeps you on the edge of your seat, the way this movie tackles topics such as anxiety and mortality so beautifully, its everything I could have hoped for and so much more from such a beloved character."
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I like it it was a good movie
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie has no business being as good as it is. Absolutely loved it! All the characters are fun to watch and likable. The pacing is excellent, I didn't check my watch once. Cannot recommend this movie highly enough."
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,amazing movie with beautiful visuals and a really nice story
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" covers dark topics like Death and Heartbreak, but the animation, comedy and characters make it possibly the silliest (and the best) movie in the ""Shrek"" franchise."
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,obra de arte buen comienzo y una buena enseñansa sutil sobre la muerte
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I cried during Puss In Boots: The Last Wish. Twice. Beautiful art direction and wonderful characters.
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme é simplesmente fantástico no fator nostalgia e na qualidade da animação. A DreamWorks correu um grande risco ao inovar, no entanto, acertou com esse novo formato. O roteiro é simples mas traz certa profundidade aos personagens o vilão é bom e faz com que eu queria vê-lo no futuro. O filme também abre portas para novos projetos expandindo um universo já existente"
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I honestly think that as of 2023, this is the best movie in the Shrek franchise. Everything about it is phenomenal, and I'd honestly say it's a perfect movie. I may even prefer this entry over Shrek 2.
It's /that/ good.

Every character is a delight, and the animation is like eye-candy. But more important than that is the story. It's awesome to see Puss go through such a character arc, tackling themes of his mortality and purpose. Seeing him grow, even as the seasoned adventurer he is. He feels like he's reached an end, yet despite it all, finds a new beginning and accepts change.

In the words of Goldilocks herself, ""Everything is just right."""
"Jan 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Unfortunately this was a horrible movie.
It was rated PG so I thought it would be ok for my kids. I didn't really see any witch craft. Just a magic star story. 
Then I was surprised by the language, the bleeping out of words. Making it normal for kids to hear. Then the violence that my kids had to turn away from. From an animated movie for crying out loud. Then I spotted a scene from when they looked at the map, I shouldn't had been surprised, but there was the all seeing eye placed on the map! Goodness! I refuse to allow my kids to be desensitized.
What should had been an innocent PG movie, turned to me having to keep explaining to my kids that the world just tries to see how far they can move the line. Which is why we have to protect our eye and ear gates."
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,puss in boots the last wish was hilarious and very heartwarming such a good movie with some mild language but still a good movie.
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme não é totalmente perfeito no meio ele perde um pouco o ritmo e recupera só no final (que não deixa o filme ruim é só uma pequena observação),mas o que ele entre em quesito de arte e animação está impecável a apresentação dos personagens o desenvolvimento da personalidade do gato de botas,a morte mds que filme maravilhoso com certeza eu pagaria de novo para assistir esse filme"
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"O melhor filme classificação livre de 2023, garantia de uma lágrima."
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had heard a bunch of good things about this movie, and boy were they right! The animation alone is gorgeous, but the music and story is all top notch. DreamWorks didn't hold back either, showing actual blood and rolling with a much darker theme. Definitely wouldn't recommend for young children, but maybe 8 and up? All around it was a fantastic movie. Super glad I saw it."
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm 30 years old, and I've been to see this three times in my local theater. 10/10, they nailed everything. Tears were shed, and many genuine laughs were shared. The casting was spot on and we are once again reminded of the magic that Dreamworks can produce. Bra-vo!!!!"
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,phenomenal. golden. an improvement on the first in every way
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Der puss in boots 2 ist ein exzellent geschriebener Film mit einem frischen Animationsstil, und das macht den Film erstaunlich. Abgesehen von diesem Film mit einem der besten Dreamworks-Bösewichte (dem Wolf des Todes), zeigt er auch eine tiefgreifende Entwicklung der Protagonisten, also gebe ich diesem Film 5 Sterne"
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"The characters, visuals, and story were outstanding"
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I love when good movies happen.
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie. My 3yo was entertained
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Godtier film! 
One of the best."
"Jan 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I absolutely recommend this movie. Holy. Dreamworks is coming back strong from The dark age also known as Trolls and Boss Baby.
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme é muito legal; animação está maravilhosa; o enredo é bom; as coreografias de combate são muito boas.
OBS: para quem cria/gosta de gatos, vamos reconhecer muitas coisa que os miaus fazem."
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Animação maravilhosa, história e enredo bom, trilha sonora maravilhosa, e um vilão maravilhoso que me deu arrepios, eu sabia que o filme seria bom, mas não nesse nivel."
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"i love the cat+the wolf 10/10 would 
 again"
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"An animated movie that's funny, thoughtful inspirational and extremely well written featuring lovable, charming characters and a memorable villain. In other words, it's everything Velma isn't."
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastically beautiful and shockingly emotional. Dreamworks takes their audience and movies seriously, as seen with Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. They do not stray from dark subject matter, and it makes for a refreshing, touching, and at times, unsettling movie."
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have nothing but good things to say about this film. Beautiful animation, amazing voice work, and a phenomenal villain. An excellent film!!"
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I haven't been so emotionally wrecked by a movie. A heart wrenching experience. Too good.
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie so much! It was funny and exciting, but also incredibly deep and thoughtful for a ""kids"" movie by exploring themes of trust, forgiveness, friendship, and mortality. I will definitely be watching it again and again. And this is coming from someone in their 20s. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"A really nice story, excellent character writing, good jokes (even great for a children's movie), and above all, the wolf, an amazing character and a perfect villain"
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"10/10 it was cool it so cute, funny and so awesome like fresh it makes puss in boots adventure cool and awesome i like it i loved the movie"
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Yes, it's worth the Hype."
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went to see Puss in Boots: The Last Wish with my fiancé and was expecting an average family movie, but I what I got was a beautifully animated film with amazing characters and themes. The movie tackles the heavy topic of death in a way that is appropriate and relatable for people of all ages and walks of life. My favorite parts of the movie were the antagonists, specifically how they use three different villain types without any of them clashing. Even as an adult, the wolf antagonist gave me chills. The relatable villain had an amazing redemption arc as part of the movie's B plot. I could say plenty more about Puss' character development, but I'll leave that to the movie itself. This movie is a must see!"
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,This was probably the most fire movie of 2023 so far. Dreamworks has outdone itself once again by creating a movie with an awesome antagonist and protagonist. 10/10 movie and I HIGHLY recommend watching it to the very end for an amazing surprise
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I decided to watch the movie only after seeing the reviews, because, before seeing what people said about the movie, I watched the other films of the Shrek universe, and I didn't dislike it, but it was so long ago I forgot almost everything. I honestly kinda forgot the film existed, and I'm glad I stumbled upon a review on YouTube, because I probably wouldn't have watched it if it weren't for this. It. Was. AMAZING. I don't want to spoil anything, but the movie has some supprisingly mature themes and depicts fear in a way that felt real."
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny and poignant at the same time. Great animation. I did not think I was going to like it but everyone did a great ob in it.
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible in every way!
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"the story, every character was amazing and I feel healed after watching this movie, it has all the emotions in it
i like it and will watch it again"
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Muy buena. Sin políticas y gran historia.
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie i have ever watched
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is one of the best movies i've ever seen and i just want you to know, if you havent watched this film yet, do it you wont regret it. 10/10 Masterpiece, The animation is flawless and reminds me a lot of spiderverse with some characters having smooth movement while the others have a slower fps, the battle scenes are really good and have a charm to them that if theres a battle scene, you know your gonna enjoy it.
now there are spoilers in this last section, so leave if you havent watched the movie yet. the characters are great and so is the character development, puss going from a fearless badass that ""laughs in the face of death"", to someone who is deeply scared of dying and losing his friends. now im gonna get this out of the way, death is an amazing character cuz he is always at the back of your mind like ""what is that really scary death wolf that wants to murder puss doing right now while they fight or just talk"" but there are thoose small reminders that, yes the plot should be moving, yes the plot is important, yes puss needs to hurry before he dies, and theese reminders come in the little whistle of death while he appears somewhere either behind or somewhere near puss. death really puts some emotional connection with puss and even the audience always fearing him, the fact that puss bleeds in the first interaction with death sets the boundaries of the film going forwards, like it isnt ""this is a kid friendly cute chirldrens film"" to ""we arent scared of doing anything and you cant except the obvious"". 10/10 film i dont usually do reviews but dang this movie is really fucking good. go watch it now"
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I came into the movie theater expecting a decently good and entertaining movie, but instead I got a fantastic film with such superb animation and storytelling. This film is everything you might want, from the heartfelt message to the lowkey terrifying encounters with the antagonist. I've nothing but good things to say about this film!

GO WATCH IT"
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Everything about this movie was 100/10 go see it right now. Great animation, the cast was amazing, the plot was amazing and it wrapped up every story arc nicely, the dialogue was on point and the character designs were all so good i cannot recommend this movie enough!!"
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Perfect animation, perfect history, perfect film"
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Great! It's how to make sequels!
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,i didn't think this movie would good then i watched it the animation was spot on and the villan is so badass i would take a spinoff or a video game and man death is the best villan out of every villan
"Jan 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not terribly original, but its a fun kids movie!"
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Had a great time with this one. Funny and heartfelt, great addition to the Shrek universe. Also, the villain was incredibly scary and effective"
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,was soooooooooooooooooo good 15/10 would watch again
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"As an Adult in his 30s i found this movie refreshing, heart grabbing, spooky, and attention keeping! I had move fun here than Avatar! A slept on Gem!"
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,So good and it's so amazing 👏
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,So good very interesting
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is epic! It's a true return to form from Dreamworks; filled with heart, humor, and a great message about life and not letting anxiety take over you. A true joy to watch from beginning to end with stellar animation!"
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a pleasure to be able to take my 2-year-old son to the cinema for the first time to watch this film without being afraid to put him in to watch ideological woke productions, because children's films have to be for children, ideology, leave it to the family to educate. But speaking of the film, I really liked the well-built story with a good movie time, animation very well done with innovations for this production, perfect actors and plot are to be congratulated. I highly recommend the movie for everyone and especially for the family to watch."
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Good family movie if u want a good laugh.
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muy buena película, la mejor de estos últimos años, con el mejor antagonista, villanos y personajes, muy admirable el trabajo que han hecho ; los animadores, ilustradores, creadores, productores etc. Y hablar del doblaje es espectacular."
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pinnacle of animated kids movies. Might get a little dark at times but honestly really enjoyable. In my opinion, perfect storytelling and plot timeline. Contains a wide variety of moral values to learn, with emphasis on bravery, and the initiative to do something for yourself, as well as living your life to the fullest. Definitely recommend"
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie probably in the last 5 years. A refreshing glimpse into how people used to make 21st century art. It's like someone gave a team from the 90s to early 2000s today's technology and told them to go wild. We should have been getting movies like this for the past two decades, but unfortunately all art has been politically subverted during that time, making for piles of badly written movies with forgettable or no fleshed out characters."
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,As an animator. The animation was INCREDIBLE. The characters were interesting and their stories were told in a way that wouldnt let you even take your eyes from the screen for a second. death as a character was one of the best villains ive ever seen and i think its a movie both adults and children can enjoy as i watched it with my little brother who is (m) 13 and i am (f) 24 and we both called it one of our best movie nights ever
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good messages for the kids. Funny and fun, good music"

"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH! It is an extraordinary animated film! It has everything you would expect of an animated film. It is funny, it has great animation, some humor that kids and adults can enjoy, and the voice acting is splendid. It also has a great story and moral to it. Personally this is much better than Avatar: The Way of Water and better than Shrek 1. I totally recommend this movie to all kids and adults!"

"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I cried to the Cat from Shrek
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A sequel that outshines its predecessor. The story, humor, and animation make this movie a fun experience that the whole family can enjoy. Don't knock it because its a family oriented film though- I actually went to see it alone as an adult- It's an enjoyable experience for all."

"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed this movie so much. I have seen it 3 times making it my most seen movie in a theater because I would just look for a reason to go again. The story, animation, villains and, humor. Everything  about this movie just made me love it so much."

"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movie. You Must watch the Movie.
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie right here? EXTRAORDINARY! The animation was so crisp and fluid and the low framerate movement made every action scene feel superb. The story was beautifully thought out and I love that they finally implemented the 9 lives cats have, and the nod to a brand new Shrek movie made me jump out of my chair. I truly love this movie and everyone who worked on it deserves all their praise!

"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,la mejor película del universo de shrek desde shrek 2
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"We thought it was great for a family outing with kiddos as young as 11 all the way up through 45!  There were a lot of really fun and hilarious jokes, if you’re paying attention!   The overall theme was an important lesson although probably lost on younger kiddos if you don’t recap."
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"simply amazing, I have no words yet with the fact that there is finally a sequel, and also the villains presented who really are incredible, congratulations Dream Works."
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Everything about this film is incredible, and death actually freakin scared me, i rlly thought puss was gonna die"
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing Movie and amazing voice acting 
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely a work of art, yes it got Eire and a little bit of hate for that because of wolf/death, being too scary for kids but, WOW, I've never been so impressed with dreamworks this is a masterpiece."
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The animation is so PERFECT and CREATIVE, the plot and themes are really well put together, the voice acting is phenomenal, the twists and spins and usage of the fairy tales make you smile and cry in the theaters. Loved every second of this. I laughed, I cried, felt bliss and it was such a surprise how incredibly GOOD this movie was!

Thank you, Dreamworks and everyone involved. Thank you for this experience."
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved all the design changes they did

"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This cartoon filled me with happiness. these wonderful characters, graphics, good story and music. Thank you DreamWorks for this"
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfect! This is Perfect!
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,It was perfect. Everything down to the last minute detail.
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"the movie is great, fun and epic but above all it is very entertaining I liked it a lot"
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Go watch it. Entertaining as hell.
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a beautiful movie - the way of animation (as if painted pictures in low fps), deep moral on the end and touching scenes. This movie is very good for whole family because both children and adults can learn about important values in life like being a trustworthy person."
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Oh. my. God. This movie was so good it was ridiculous. The humor all lands, the action is superb, and the morale and message is great (and super emotionally impactful!) For a kids movie, this is almost unrealistically good. 10/10"
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is almost perfect! I just think it lacks some good soundtrack, even the first puss in boots movie had a good soundtrack moment!"
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,unironicly fire i loved the storie and the villians it was actually quite a mature movie and with a deep theme and the visiuals and music mathced the storie i hope dreamworks keeps up the work
"Jan 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was not of my ""taste"""
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such a good family movie. The adult jokes it has sprinkled in it just made it ten times better. I love Perrito and I hope everyone loves him like I do. Although his story is very sad, he looks at the bright side of things and it brings a big lesson to children. I also like the real topics that Puss in Boots touches on like anxiety that Puss has when he hears the eerie whistle."
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A movie that I really enjoy, with great characters and history."
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie I dont know how they did it, the story, the visuals, all of it was amazing and at the very least tolerable. I enjoyed every minute watching this movie"
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the characters and the story. The animation was amazing.
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Not all b.guys are likeable but i recomend that as Death pulls it farbeyond production we usually get now.
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Only downside would be that I didn't *love* the final scene after the resolution, and maybe the pacing felt not perfect at some point, but genuinely a great movie. Makes me excited for Dreamwork's new content."
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie I've seen in a while
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was delightful
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing story and loved the characters. Would see again

"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,AMAZING MOVIE!! they get everything right
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a great movie from the beginning to the end!! There were several funny scenes. Im 59 and went with my 26 year old daughter and we both absolutely loved the movie!
They did a great job with the movie and it kept our attention throughout the entire movie. I havent seen the first movie but Im definitely going to watch it."
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the few very good cartoons written in 2022. Watched with 9 and 12 year old and they loved it!
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"What an amazing movie! The score, the visuals, the story, the characters, the voice acting, everything's just so perfect! Loved every single minute of it! Absolute masterpiece."
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good movie, way better than anything I've seen from disney or other ffanchises the past 4 years! Really enjoyed."
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,i didnt even watch it but they say its good
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,#PUSSYSWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"An amazing movie, animation that look's incredible and voice acting that leaves on wanting more. As an adult who grew with Shrek this movie really hits home with the ""getting older"" concept and what we may or may not be able to do anymore… Overall one of the best movies I have seen so far this year."
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie! Many amazing references, awesome humour, great animations! All of this action, humour, with a dash of emotions. Definitely had my eyes glued to the screen the entire time, so glued I almost forgot about my concession snacks! This movie is perfect for all ages. The whole theatre clapped at the end, if that doesn’t give you an idea of how amazing it was! A MUST SEE!"
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie of 2022, the action is great, comedy is spot on and it deals with mature themes and doesn't cut them short for a cheap laugh like so many movies do today"
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, just gotta love Antonio Banderas every time he speaks. Darkest villain I have ever seen in a kids movie but it was fantastic. Highly recommend this movie. Great action, comedy, and graphics were insane!!"
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved it!!! I laughed, I cried. It's amazing. 💖"
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Um filmes que chega ate superar o primeiro, com uma trama muito bem desenvonvida Gato de Botas 2 têm vilões muito carismaticos e um subprotagosnista com uma históeia lindo e comevento, já o Gato de Botas é perfeito com em outros filmes, a produção me ganhou pela alta qualidade e muitas referencias que a DreamWorks Animation consegui impor no filme."
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show-stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference to or not reference, put it in a blender, s**t on it, vomit on it, eat it, and give birth to it

-Lady Gaga"
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wonderful visuals, mature themes, strong action, excellent characters/arcs, great humor (light and dark), and practically perfect pacing and storytelling. Second time seeing it, still fan-freaking-tastic!"
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie with good message and stellar animation
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,this is the peak. this is the turnaround. animated movies are now being held to a new bar.
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Stunning animation and a story meaty enough for adults but fun enough for kids!
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Animation was amazing and also the angel shots
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Handling its themes maturely without feeling overtly edgy, mainly just tastefully done if you will. Yes, I am indeed talking about the sequel to a spin-off of one of the most-memed movie franchise in pop culture. The dog sidekick felt like he might get annoying but seems to be the best take on the naïve sidekick in a film like this in a while. And the wolf antagonist, if your kids are easily frightened by a movie like Caroline not too long ago, maybe second guess bringing them, but if they handled that well and enjoyed that film overall, I encourage you to take them to see this. Puss in Boots is the perfect flawed role model. And what I said about handled ""maturely"", yes this movie has a message great for even the adults, maybe even especially so."
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie's a must-see if you liked the first two Shrek movies (if you're really cool and have good taste). It expertly embodies the spirit Dreamworks had in its early days that made it special. The movie puts entertaining spins on familiar stories similar to the takes on fairy tale characters in Shrek, as well as creating a memorable plotline with interesting characters that reminded me of Kung Fu Panda's storytelling.

The movie's story is also surprisingly deeply mature. It tackles subjects like anxiety and valuing life in a way that's both intellectual enough to carry thoughtful messages and emotional enough to connect audiences with the characters and make you care about them.

There wasn't a single time in this movie where I regretted watching it or wished I was doing something else. It's fun, thought-provoking, and doesn't overstay its welcome."
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies I seen in 2023, the story was well written, voice acting was well acted, and Death was terrifying to even adults too!"
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love it.. Awesome plot, music and ending.. Totally recommend to watch especially for kids."
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,YOOOOO MOVIE GOOOOOOOD LIKE CRAZY PUSS DIFF
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,literally everything was 10/10. best villian. best plot. best everything.
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely spectacular movie and a must-watch! The story, animation, characters, and music all tied together so well and when the movie ended I stayed in my seat wanting more! Several scenes as well as sounds (that whistle will haunt me for months to come) were so memorable and Puss in Boots has made an outstanding legendary comeback! Watch the movie if you dare (which you definitely should!)"
"Jan 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's nothing necessarily special or new, it does what the next film in the Shrek franchise should -- it's a movie that kids should enjoy, that parents shouldn't exactly dread taking them to see. It offers fun Easter eggs and animation as well.
- fresh"
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is one of the best movies I saw in recent years. Not just animation-wise, it's brilliant, bright, touching. It as wonderful takes on characters I didn't thought could have such an amazing twist. A charismatic storytelling and some amazing portrayals. I wish there could be more animation like this. More cinema-worthy stories for everyone like this. Would and will absolutely recommend it to everyone I know! From design to soundtrack, it's breathtaking. I hope this becomes a must see classic for every family one day. It sure has the material for it."
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Easily the best animated movie of the year. The animation looks incredible, the writing is sharp, the characters are memorable, and the message is a good one that is presented very tastefully. Not much to dislike about this movie, definitely a must-watch for animation or Dreamworks fans."
"Jan 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Didn't see the first one, and saw this one a whim. Overall, it's a cute, fun kids movie. Good cast, and enough jokes to keep it going for all ages, particularly if you know a little Spanish."
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie overall, was honestly not expecting much but had a lot of fun watching. Good mix of character development, great action, and comedic effect"
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic. Fight scenes are insanely good animated. The villain is badass and menacing. Even the ending was not cheesy like I would have expected from a childs movie. It was a great experience.
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie i've seen since spiderverse (2019) and must watch as the last Puss in Boots movie came out back in 2011. Easily beats current Disney competition (Yes, I mean you Strange World)."
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The plot, character development, and resolve were so great. Any kid would love this movie."
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,The most well made action I've ever seen in an animated movie. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is an achievement in filmmaking. It features some of the most well written characters arcs of the year. Every single character is unique and fun to watch. The cast of voice actors is phenomenal and it's nice to see actors like Florence Pugh on this project. The animation style is stunning and I never wanted to look away from the screen. This is yet another incredible addition to an already loaded year of 2022.
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie made my eyes happy
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely Fantastic. Amazing story and Villain. Very well done.
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything from the animation to the story and moment-to-moment writing was an absolute delight. I loved every minute of Puss in Boots’ latest adventure.
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I didn’t watch the movie, my car broke down on the way. Can I have my money back please!!!!"
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the funny cat movie. We need more Puss in Boots movies.
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Basically the best puss in boots movie, has one or two bumps but all around one of the best movies i have watched"
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic, loved the wolf."
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"best movie ever, DreamWorks hits different"
"Jan 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,it wasn't very kids friendly and poorly done
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun movie to see! Loved all the characters and Perro the dog!
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is so good I don't know where to start to praise it. This movie revived my hope in modern movies. There is no prejudice, hate, or spiteful feeling. The characters are very well written. Kitty soft paws and Puss work off each other so incredibly well. Take notes media, this is how you write a strong female character that isn't a mary sue or unlikeable. The story is very tight and not a second of time is wasted. The animation rocks. The villain is stone-cold. I honestly could go on for pages and pages on this show. I recommend this show to anyone and everyone."
"Jan 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Animation is really good. Lots of funny moments and jokes all ages would laugh at. The plot, similar to many jokes, can easily be understood by younger ages but also appreciated by older ages. All the voice acting was very good except for that stupid dog Perro. The movie would easily be ranked higher if it wasnt for the voice acting of Perro. The pitch should of been higher and the tone could of been exaggerated better. Otherwise a solid movie."
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow, excellent movie. It was better than the original. "
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,THIS MOVIE IS SOOOOO GOOD !!!! THE ANIMATION 10/10 THE VILLAIN 10/10 THE WAY IT DEALS WITH TOPICS 10/10 THE HUMOR 10/10 FUNNY FOR THE WHOLE FAM 😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"great movie, better than. The Uchihuahua was funny, and


SPOILER ALERT, Making death the main villain was crazy"
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible. Deserves all the praise.
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"O Filme esta incrivel personagens muito bem construidos, A animação esta perfeita com esse novo estilo achei otimo apenas"
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best movies I watched
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Animation, Story, and Themes were all 10/10. A movie that can be enjoyed by people of all ages."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've watched other DreamWorks movies and Puss in Boots to get a gist of his premise. However, this movie set a whole new standard for me. From just 5 minutes in I was in awe of how spectacular the animation, composition, and line deliveries were. I was on the edge of my seat most of the time and many scenes left me in tears and laughters. I love it oh so much, I haven't seen anything so fresh like this in a while. Some things in the movie really stuck with me, I think I really needed to hear them during this time. Thank you for making such an amazing movie thats just pure art and talents. My wordings aren't good enough to describe how life-changing this is. We as a society should all love watch this instead of the V show."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"La primer película me gusto bastante, pero la secuela es una obra maestra... Le da mil vueltas a la primera. El humor me encanta. La animación es un deleite. El rediseño de los personajes tirando más a lo caricatura se me hacen muy hermosos. Los antagonistas son 10/10. Y el desarrollo de personaje que tiene el gato durante la película me encanta. 
 La vi varias veces ya, tanto en Ingles como español latino y la recomiendo al 100% (La disfrute más en el idioma original)"
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Melhor que o 1 filme
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing animation and story. Deeper and edgier than one would expect from a PG film.
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I would watch this movie Million times.
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,We went with our grandchildren.  We really loved seeing how they related to the dog and got the message of friendship and love.
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Simplesmente perfeito
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was really nice to watch. The animation is beautiful :)
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fazia tempo que eu não ficava empolgada assistindo um filme de animação, personagens cativantes, cenas emocionantes, desenvolvimento extraordinário, animação impecável, belíssimo trabalho."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muito Top, Enredo e Moral simples mas interessantes e um vilão muito brabo,"

"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Seen the movie 3 times now - Greatly paced story with funny characters make the movie wildly entertaining, while also knowing when to tone down the humor. Definitely  one of the best movies of 2022."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie ever I am not joking i watched it twice i love it so much
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome!Worth every second! Now I wanna make a tattoo with this wolf…Definitely the best antagonist I've ever seen))
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"What an emotional rollercoaster. From cute little giggles to bursts of GAUGAUGAUGAU's, this movie tickled my funny bone. The adult themes such as death and family reflected in Puss in Boots is beyond perfect. Had me tearing up and my heart in my throat as I listened to Puss deal with death. 10/10. I would die for you perrito."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,puss in boots is the best movie I've ever seen. perrito is the best character ever and he kept the movie alive. puss has an amazing character development. 10/10
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Peak in boots. Greatest movie ever.
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,BEST ANIMATED MOVIE EVER
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really loved this movie, I loved the switch between the smooth animation and the almost stop motion effect during the fight scenes. Also I feel puss in boots looks way better now. Very good movie 10/10 would recommend"
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MOVIE OMG, BRO THIS MOVIE IS ACTUALLY CRAZY, THE ANIMATION, THE EMOTION, THE COLORS, THE CHARACTERS, ITS PERFECT.

i have no flaws with this movie its literally perfect i love the characters, this movie made me cry TWICE(ive never cried at a movie before) this movie somehow gets me emotionally connected to like 10 characters in the span of an hour, HOW DO YOU DO IT WE NEED MORE MOVIES LIKE THIS PLEASE"
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best thing to come out of the Shrek-iverse. The film carried the same fairytale lore as all of the other films in the franchise, but in a way that all made sense. No one was placed in without having a roll in the progression of the movie, where as the others threw as many fairytale characters as they could fit. The animation style is enjoyable and fresh. 
The story was well written, and had some meaning by the end of the film which made it enjoyable to watch with my kids."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots is an animated story focused on young audience.  However adults can relate to the struggles and dilemmas of Puss, making the movie a enjoyable treat to all audiences.  Definitely a must watch for all kids and adults who enjoy animations and comedies."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Increíble, the way of boarding the death theme with great lessons, definetly for all family"
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,W.O.W WHAT A MOVIE. i really underestimated this movie compared to the ugly first movie but wow the fight with the giant got me sooOOO amped up for it. the characters were abstract and very expressive. death is beautiful
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie this was a masterpiece
"Jan 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Too long for the storyline!
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"LOVED IT!!!!!!! I was scared I'd be somewhat biased because my very own cat is almost Puss' spitting image (which is half the reason I decided to watch this, the other being the beautiful animation) but like most people, I was pleasantly surprised when the movie was actually amazing. I haven't cried at a move in a while, A Dog's Purpose was the last thing to make me properly bawl, but the scene in the woods really got me crying! Beautiful animation, heartfelt story, every single character is compelling in their own way, and finally, the cats are so cute! 10/10 would recommend."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a truly fantastic cartoon, the best I have seen in years)))"
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie and amazing voice actors
"Jan 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,NF01A::和我一起去看了，我认为这部电影有些幼稚，不适合成年人单独观看
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best animated movies I have ever seen. Up there with Into the Spider-Verse, and The Lego Movie. The characters are likeable, the story is simple yet incredibly effective. Death is one of the best villains that Dreamworks has ever introduced. If you haven't seen this movie, you are severely missing out on one of the best animated movies of 2022."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"i saw this three times just to spite avatar lmao
anyways its a great film please watch it if you respect animation or yourself"
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Although unexpected this movie was amazing the animation style was beautiful and it managed to explore darker themes in an accurate way , while also having some of the best written villains for a kids movie. I would definitely recommend Going and seeing it in cinemas."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"perfeito, um dos melhores filmes de animação atualmente, se não o melhor, roteiro, animação, dublagem, humor 100%"
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of 2022 and easily one of the best of Dreamworks
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really unexpected compared to the 1st movie, BUT THIS MOVIE IS FANTASTIC! Great story, great cast, great music, great animation. 10/10, and it's able to stand apart from the other shrek movies."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"5/5, amazing movie. You need to see this movie RIGHT NOW! It was really good it made me happy."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny dog and silly cat!
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"An absolute cinematic masterpiece, I don't go out to the movies often and thought this would be an interesting film to see for once and it absolutely did not disappoint whatsoever.  The visuals are beautifully animated, and even the way Death was represented was amazing too, every time he would whistle it sent literal chills down my spine. The characters were very likeable throughout the whole movie, and the storyline felt intriguing as well. I wish I could go back and watch it for the first time again, and I highly recommend watching this movie if you haven't already! :D"
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"DreamWorks back at it again! 
Amazing art style and writing!"
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie for all ages, hits on serious topics, a few adults jokes like any shrek franchise movie, characters lovable, and banger soundtrack."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,What a fantastic n adventure!  The animation was incredible and the story was well conceived. You will enjoy every minute!
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story and great storytelling. The villain is fierce and drives the protagonist (Puss in boots) to make choices -- that drives the story forward beautifully. Weaved into the story are the themes of fear/courage, family/loneliness, gratitude/gluttony and the themes are easily recognizable when we watch the characters make decisions. It's been a long time since I saw an animated movie with really funny, not cringy jokes. The comedic dialogue it's not related to our current events which makes this animation last for ages. It's so fresh."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Cinematic masterpiece. It changed my life and who I am as a person
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very funny and engaging movie. Kept my three kids (7/7/10) all engaged for the entirety, and I very much enjoyed it too!"
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's got good animation, story, characters, character development, plot and etc...
I was full of shivers and excitement when I heard that whistling."
"Jan 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Even though I don't think it's a masterpiece I still think it's definitely worth watching it. (Big jack horner was the best villain in the whole movie).
"Jan 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"My 10 year old grandson liked it so much, this was the second time he saw it. As for me, I fell asleep a few times."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A delicate film that shows the audience a deep reflection on life. Recommended for the whole family, without a doubt."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,cinematic masterpiece
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible movie, one of the best villains I've ever seen, the wolf was fantastic."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Well animation and story.
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing animation, sound effects, music and story, an absolute must watch."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Best dreamworks animation so far.
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had no expectations going into this movie and there was no way I could have ever predicted the reality of it
Incredible and unique animation aside, the story and characters are deeply emotional and mature in a way that is wild for a Puss in Boots sequel in the best way
It is cinematic, tense, and heart wrenching and it is truly a perfect movie
I have seen it in theaters 3 times so far and each time was just as enthralling as the the first"
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was truly one of the best experiences to see on big screen due to the amazing and beautiful animation and action choreography. I was not expecting for there to be such strong emotional moments in this film along with lovable new characters. The new wolf antagonist was such a show-stealer despite the limited time he had on screen. Overall, it's a very good movie for all ages."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme ta massa!vários vilões, uma história que contagia,um desfecho incrível!O Lobo é um Ícone! Incrível!"
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good animation, the way the camera move within the world makes it look very fluid and colorful. Especially the fight scenes. The villain was also an incredibly good character, death."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was absolutely fantastic. I've never expected a movie geared towards kids to hit this hard. Best one I've seen in quite sometime. Definitely a must watch
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A perfect movie in every way.
Along with Shrek 2, How to Train Your Dragon 2 and Kung Fu Panda 2 is the best of Dreamworks Animation."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"So good I made an account just to give it 5 stars. It's written wonderfully, and every character is interesting and fun to watch. They tackle darker topics and handle them PERFECTLY. Absolute must see!!"
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"The most epic, touching and meaningful animated movies I've ever seen, totally must see for all ages!"

"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,9/10  movie was better then I thought. A lot of adult humor
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"With great humor, unique animation, and especially earned emotion, Puss In Boots: The Last Wish is a masterpiece of a sequel that is definitely worth your time."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,If you have one wish what would you have wished for?
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"By Jaishal Singh 
Good is so storytelling"
"Jan 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not great but worth a watch at least once. Pretty good story but didnt have the amusing feel of the first movie. Nothing nearly as good as the cat dance fight scene. At least it didnt have the horrible egg.
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Very cute.  Some of the animation is kind of weird though.
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I love everything I hate nothing
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved this movie. It kept some of the corniness from the other movies. I laughed and cried.
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went with my friends, and we absolutely loved it. The villain was so well-made, and the animation was terrific. The jokes were good for kids but also relatable for adults. Just a perfect movie!"
"Jan 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was NOT a film for children. The animation was superb. Although the movie contained several important, valid messages (for adults), there was too much violence."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,How did a Puss in boots movie make me feel way too many emotions is beyond me. Please do yourself a favour and watch it
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"No me esperaba esto , me encanto la animación el desarrollo de personajes , estoy muy sorprendida es una buena pelicula ."

"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,So cute and funny must see with the family.
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,this was a defining experience.
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good, funny cat"
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"very good story but they've changed the animation style , noticed it in the Minions movie. reminds me of the difference in Warner Brothers cartoons of the 40's and 50's  and the current style. l assume the new method is cheaper definitely not better ."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Spectacular animation, scoring, character design, narrative. wow!"
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Took granddaughters, ages 4, 5, and 6. They liked the movie although they said some of the scenes were too scary. The themes of the movie are more for adults than kids. Great animation."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was but a boy going into this movie but after I became a man. A man who values not many, but one life. This life. Thank you Puss In Boots: The Last Wish (2022) for making value what I have and who I am."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best film of live, romantic, funny, intelligent"
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great animation and the voices are perfect - and synchronized with the faces.
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny for the whole fam!
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Another great movie in the Shrek trilogy.
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Took my grandaughter, we were not dissapointed!!!   Lots of action and funny comments made by Puss.  I would have liked to see more of the cats from Mama Lunna's there sure were plenty of them!"
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a kid's movie with dark and real elements to it, the concept of death, concurring the fear of death, stress, and family. It also has a very nice Animation style and story with good pacing and amazing characters."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,The animation style is drop dead gorgeous! A must see for anyone who adores the Spiderverse films.
"Jan 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was cute but a lot of the language was either too mature/inappropriate for around 8 yrs and younger (in my opinion), and many scary images for the younger kids. 
Other than that, it was at least entertaining and good storyline. The cast was really good."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible! The animation and voice acting, plot and character design is off the charts!!!! I genuinely wanted to rewatch it again once It was finished because how good it was! Death was also good, the representation of death and symbolism"
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Juggles lots of characters, but does so expertly. Good villains. Even the joke side character is both non-obnoxious and plot relevant. Took my 10 and 12 year old to see it, and all three of us loved it."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is absolutely AMAZING! The new art style seems fresh, and matches the movie very nicely.
Not only that, but the characters themselves seem new and exciting, with a more deep personality, while maintaining what makes them unique and special.
Both the protagonists and antagonists are well developed, and put together a show for the audience. There are no characters who feel ""left out"", with each and every one of them having enough screen time to make you connect and like them even more.
The humor and desperation are also mixed perfectly. No jokes are made out of place (and, believe me, the jokes in this movie will certainly make you laugh at least once), and the rush of every character, especially Puss in Boots while facing his main fear, is transmitted to the audience flawlessly.
Definitely a 10/10, and one of, if not the, best animated movie DreamWorks has ever made."
"Jan 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fine for what it is.  A little predictable at the end. Animation much better than the other movies and Shrek movies.
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing, creative, visually stunning, and with deep messages for all viewers. One of the best animated villains I have ever seen as well. Watch it!"
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Super movie, wspaniałe widowisko"
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,I was only 11 & 14 when Shrek 1&2 came out. Lost interest in the series after that. Took my daughter to see this movie last night and didn't realize I needed to see this movie in my life. It touches on some topics I think about as an adult and has a really good story about wants and needs while being self reflective.
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it it's for grown ups and kids amazing background and good characters
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved this movie. Never saw the first one either.

"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"You HAVE to see thjs movie, it is amazing (BTW it is a standalone story so you don't necessarily need to watch the first one). The animation is absolutely phenomenal - it has good fight choreography and is very smooth. All the characters are either reallt likeable. The villain is absolutely terrifing. And the story itself is very creative."

"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,cinema found a new life
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great feel good, action-packed movie.  Im so glad that Antonio Banderas has continued in the role.  Well done!"

"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"some of the writing is cringy but the show is more for kids so what do you expect, other than that it's fantastic, the character designs are on point, the villains are well done, highly recommend"
"Jan 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,Too intense for my 5 year old grandson
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,A good movie for kids and adults
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is one of the best movies I have watched in a while. The animation is phenomenal, the sound design is literally perfect, the story is just lovely. I highly reccomend."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a master piece, amazing story, characters, animations, pacing. If I could give it a score from 1-10 I'd give it a 1,000,000,000 it's perfect in my opinion. Great action and it's a cinematic master piece. I recommend this to everyone."
"Jan 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,I did not like the new animation style.
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,I didn't like the cussing. Cussing was beeped out but still my kids knew what was up. other than that it was a great show.
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a very cute movie. Loved the ending!
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"must watch.
The colors and animation is awesome. The villans awesome, the end, awsome, the side characters are perfect.It follows the story of puss going down to his last life and death is after him."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining. They have a little bit of everything focus more on the action and comedy.
"Jan 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was an easy watch nothing too sophisticated but good enough. The overall experience was great. It also stuck with most of its jokes. Great one to watch with a family.
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved storyline and fairytale- nursery rhymes references. Mix of animation threw me off a little but still was great entertainment
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"the animation is of similarity to the spiderverse movie but better. on top of the amazing animation style, it shows a beautiful story about mortality and death. 10/10. i could watch it a thousand times and not be bored"
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"So very well done!!!! Very detailed, hilarious, adventurous, and cute...all around entertaining!!! I will definitely be watching the next one!!"
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love this movie! I think it is very special and reminds the audience that ""Kids movies"" dont have to be bland and full of nonsense for the sake of entertainement. The animation is exiting and you can see that much love and thoughts went into this project. (How it should be in every movie) I didnt expect to like it this much, but it really stands out in comparison to the mainstream modern movies. Love the creativity! :)"
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie to see I totally recommend it I love it ❤️
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I would have never expected Puss in boots of all things would end up being one of my favorite animated movies of all time!! The animation is gorgeous and, while obviously inspired by into the spider-verse, keeps its own style which fits the fairytale narrative. Death is a fantastic villain and the scenes with him have a complete tonal change. Hes such a fantastic villain. The other villains are also great. I love all of the characters and they all have some great arcs, especially Puss. Everything in this movie is amazing. Its an exhilarating thrillride that you never want to stop. There is also ""swearing"" in this movie. In a kids movie!! Just amazed at the quality of the movie. BTW there are no actual F-bombs or anything like that."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, really enjoyed it with my family."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme muito bom em :

Trilha sonora 
História 
Carisma 
Drama 
Comédia 
Vilão 10/10"
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Now I'm definitely biased, as I loved ""The Adventures of Puss in Boots"" as a kid and watched it twice. But this movie is so cool. There are consistent themes of death, you can even see him in the background of some scenes. I love the art style. It's so bright and colorful, and you can even see the paint strokes. The story is heartwarming, although I believe the scenes with death are anxiety inducing and could be scary for young children. But I did love the references, like death putting coins over the eyes like the ancient Greeks. I was surprised by some scenes (like them going over each of Puss' deaths), but I really liked it. I think it's a good movie that shows how animation isn't just for children, and how adults can enjoy it as well. I hope more movies like this come out in the future."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,great kids movie would recommend for your youngin
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful animation, great voice acting and amazing story. Would recommend to any ages."

"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Every movie cliche that's ever worked in one movie and they pull it off flawlessly. The teaser at the end.....
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a fun movie. Didn’t spot any wokeness in it. Great for kids!
"Jan 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Did it have a plot??  I could not tell.
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"oh i ABSOLUTELY cried my eyes out at That One Scene!!!!!!!!!!!! i rarely cry during movies and ALMOST NEVER sob in the cinema but i sure did for this movie!!!! anyways the art direction and animation had me gushing over every single scene. the fights were so dynamic, the character designs were so fun, the themes and plot were woven together so well???? like sure the script was pretty simple and sometimes i think they didn't need to add dialogue in certain places but ultimately its a movie accessible to younger audiences and i think that's just great!!!!!! i really want to rewatch this ASAP because i'm starting to think it might become a comfort movie or even an All-Time Favorite........."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,This moive hitting diffrent
"Jan 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good storyline, gripping animation, and super selection of voices, this movie stands out like Shrek!"
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite having a rough start, its sequel redeems itself with Puss facing new challenges. It also has new and memorable characters, great villains, absolutely stunning and also comedic moments. Definitedly a must-see!"
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Took my 4 yr old grandson and we both loved it. It kept him interested in it the whole movie.  Very cute movie!
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Um filme incrível, animação impecável, vilão excepcional e batalhas de alto nível, esse filme é a ressurreição da dreamworks e um exemplo de como fazer uma animação mesclada com ação.

Enfim, recomendo muito."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than the original
"Jan 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,I took my grandchildren and they all liked it. It was good with lots of adventure. I didn't know it would be a little dark. Over all very good.
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny and entertaining for the whole family
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Nice to have an animated movie that stands out once in a while
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,It's one of the best DreamWorks movie of all time
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Everything in this movie was abolutely incredible. The animation (Thanks to spiderverse for the influence), the voices, the wolf of course, the message is also very cool, it's not just a cute cat who do cool stuff, there is a big message behind. Really really enjoyed the film. Go see it now."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Completely mind blown at how good this movie is.
It's actually outrageous how good a movie this is for a 10 year late sequel to a Shrek spin off series."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Literal masterpiece. This movie tackles very real situations of anxiety, panic attacks and mortality. There's no universe where this is a bad movie, it wants to do a little of everything and it does everything perfectly. If i had to think of a complaint it would be the fact that its not long enough because I loved this. 15/10 please watch it"
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't give such high scores without truly meaning it. That said, Puss in Boots: the Last Wish was absolutely phenomenal and I recommend this film to anyone who wants to be taken to the edge of their seats. I did not expect anything more than a mid-level animated film to see with the kids. Its not that. There are themes and elements that take place within the film that adults can surely relate to even if it is told in an entertaining way. Go see it, you will not regret it."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Art. This is cinema. This is the puss
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie was bussin no kizzy. me and all my jhits loved it 😹😹
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good movie. Has quite a cliche fairy tale plot, but subverts it just like the Shrek movies did. The villains are also very good. The wolf is on par with some of the best Disney villains. Do note that the wolf will be terrifying to younger children, even I got scared by this guy. Still great movie, a must-watch at worst"
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,I didn't think Puss in Boots: the Last Wish would come out this amazing and special. This is by far the best animated film of 2022.
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed the movie and how well it mixes tension, fun, plot and character development. I was involved with the film from start to finish."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really thought-provoking, cute, fun adventurous tale."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,A also 10/10 this movie manages to top shrek 1 and 4 and Evan know it know where close to toping Shrek 2  it still great it makes me more excited for Shrek 5 and the best part of this film is one of the villans death he's only in it for like 2 minutes but that doesn't stop him from being a great villan. As for the story and other characters are pretty good so in the end this is a pretty good movie that you have to watch in theaters
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best kid movies Ive seen in recent years. Very funny and cute. Plot that could be enjoyed by younger and older kids.
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed every minute, kids loved it."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie. I think what makes this a must see is that it's not trying to be a perfect movie and because of that level of freedom it is able to tell the story it needs to tell, full of soul and passion."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,beautiful animation and some really tense moments for a dreamworks movie
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies I have ever seen. It's funny, surprising, incredible animation, and some of the coolest characters I have seen in any movie. Small spoiler warning there are a lot of deaths for a kids movie multiple people explode (into glitter but still)"
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,The popcorn got everywhere. Have fun janitors! Luv Shockwave❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked the character development of Puss In Boots, and Kitty Softpaws. I believe the first 10 minutes could have been cut a little bit, but all and all a great movie!"
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was a visual and emotional delight from start to finish. It had an excellent way of dealing with morality and the animation was too wonderful to even begin to describe.
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Such an interesting take on the subject of life & death.
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent!!! 'Puss in Boots: The Last Wish' is amazing and entertaining, everything they did here, gave the Shrek universe a new take, a good fresh start and also an opportunity to bring one of the best animation of last year. The action is good, the cinematography is colorful and wonderful, the characters are hilarious and charismatic. Overall this flick is very well executed, works for the whole family and had one of the best villains ever."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Completely blew it out of the field with this one! Very happy that these 13 years were not in vein!
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie for any audience!!! Animation in the movie reminds me of Spiderman Into the Spider-Verse and recommend movie.
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is amazing! I love it! The animation is beautiful and everything is so--I just can't explain how beautiful and amazing this movie is.
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss goes on another adventure and ponders the end of the line. Enough swashbuckling fun and cat humor mixed in with a bit of a deeper meditation on mortality.

Perrito is a good addition and it's good to see Goldie, Jack Horner, 3 Bears, and Kitty Softpaws again. My entire family loved it."
"Jan 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Movie scared my 8 and 4 year old right from the beginning we had to leave the movie,after the red eye wolf scene, absolutely horrible my kids loved the first movie and we're really excited about this one but it was a complete let down, trying to scare little kids from the beginning of the movie."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, great writing, great character development (even for the secondary characters), great movie. The lower framerate may make the action sequences not as fluid as those of the first movie, but the movie absolutely benefits from it, so it's still a solid animation style for a solid movie."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"The kiddos and I throughly enjoyed it!
Definitely recommend"
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Realllllllllly Good movie! I highly recommend it!!!!
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Animation was awesome, great story, most of the humor worked and John Mulaney did a great Nathan Lane impression,"
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Didnt always keep my 4 year old interested but it was cute
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,My 6 year old Grandson loved the show!
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Hilarious movie must watch
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,ANIMATION IS PEAKKK AND A GREAT MOVIE
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie of the year, everything about it was amazing."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,hilarious. loved the animation
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Simply an amazing movie. Its use of the animation medium with breathtaking visuals and dinamic and fun action scenes only makes the film's absolutely fresh and deeply emotional story even better.
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Very deep animated movie. This takes all the 5 stars.
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely wonderful movie
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,10/10 would recommend the best movie I have ever seen!!!!!
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Everything from the villain(s) to the story to the characters to the…EVERYTHING made me smile. Even the sad parts made me tear up. That whole bit with Goldilocks in her old house made me cry in the theater, and I cry during very few movies! The animation was STUNNING, especially in the action scenes. I love that the story is based around trust, I feel like that's a really good concept for Puss In Boots. Going back to the characters, the little dog was the cutest thing ever, he was so positive and adorable and…AAAGH I love him so much
And don't even get me STARTED ON THE WOLF! HE WAS SO TERRIFYING THAT WHEN HE SHOWED UP, IT WASN'T JUST PUSS SHAKING IN HIS BOOTS, BUT ME TOO! I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH!! (Also, it has moments/jokes for all ages, which I love in really any movie)"
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best animated films I have seen in years
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very cute and funny, my daughter really enjoyed it!"
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun adventure. Great for kids & adults. A lot of great comical conversation. Winning is not what's most important in life if it costs you relationships. Make the most of your life.
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"🇧🇷 Eu devo começar falando da animação. Joel Crawford faz um ótimo trabalho ao mesclar 2D com 3D, trazendo o mesmo efeito visual de Homem Aranha: No Aranhaverso (2018). Gato de Botas trás o retorno triunfal de personagens que amamos como Kitty Pata Mansa (Salma Hayek), o protagonista Gato de Botas (Antônio Bandeiras), e nos apresenta a Perrito (Harvey Guillén) um cachorrinho abandonado que é impossível não se apaixonar, além de trazer a essência da DreamWorks e da Franquia Shrek novamente, brincando com contos de fadas e trazendo grandes referências e apresentando Cachinhos Dourados (Florence Pugh) e os Ursos, O Grilo falante e inclusive um vilão completamente arrepiante e macabro e que transmite medo. A Última vez que a DreamWorks fez isso foi em 2014 em Como Treinar o Seu Dragão 2 com Drago Sangue-Bravo. Gato de Botas 2: O Último Pedido é um presente para as famílias, crianças e fãs de Animação em 2023. Se você vai assistir em 3D, compensa muito. O Roteiro e a mensagem que o filme transmite são excelentes, e ainda vem com um musical divertido de se assistir e com uma surpresa incrível no final.

🇺🇸 I should start by talking about animation. Joel Crawford does a great job of mixing 2D with 3D, bringing the same visual effect as Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018). Puss in Boots brings the triumphant return of characters we love such as Kitty Pata Mansa (Salma Hayek), the protagonist Puss in Boots (Antônio Bandeiras), and introduces us to Perrito (Harvey Guillén) an abandoned puppy who is impossible not to fall in love with, besides of bringing the essence of DreamWorks and the Shrek Franchise again, playing with fairy tales and bringing great references and featuring Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Bears, The Jiminy Cricket and even a completely creepy and macabre villain who transmits fear. The last time DreamWorks did this was in 2014's How to Train Your Dragon 2 with Drago Bloodblood. Puss in Boots 2: The Last Order is a gift for families, children and Animation fans in 2023. If you're going to watch it in 3D, it pays off a lot. The script and the message that the film conveys are excellent, and it even comes with a fun musical to watch and an incredible surprise at the end."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie overall loved every second of it especially the death wolf easily a 10 out of 10 movie.
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Funny, smart, and pure entertainment "
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,THIS IS THE BEST ANIMATED FILM OF THE YEAR SINCE BIG HERO 6 AND STRANGE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,The intro for the movie with the giant from the trailer had no reason to be as good as it was. The whole movie was pretty fun and visually stunning
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,It was brilliant! With the absolute terror in a character and beautiful animation I can't understand why anyone couldn't enjoy the movie.
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is very interactive, with visually stunning animation that brings the fairytale to life. The family loved it. Can't wait to see it again!"
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,it was so cute and sweet... absolutely loved it and so did the kids would definitely recommend seeing.
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed the movie. I really recommended it My kids, my wife and I spent a good afternoon watching this movie."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Is very nice and entertaining, good movie"
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible, and I’m not joking"
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie for all ages. The animation was amazing & characters were enjoying to watch. Go see this movie!!
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Great storyline and child friendly. My 6 year old daughter loved it.
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"A true masterpiece, this is legitimately the best animated movie I've ever watched. Can't wait for more from Dreamworks and the Shrek Series!"
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"A very cute, family friendly movie that will pull at your heartstrings! The animation style is also incredibly lovely, and really gives it a “fairy tale” aesthetic!"
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,An unexpected delight.
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"An adorable tale of stopping to look at what you actually have in life. I wasn't a fan of the stop action chalky fight scenes, but other than that, love hearing Antonio Banderas back on the big screen. Definitely hoping for another Puss in Boots soon."
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"impressive devopment of pretty deep themes for a kids movie with loveable characters, genuinely funny moments, and wonderful animation to boot."
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Genuinely the best animated film I have seen in years. I cannot fathom how good this was, Death was the best villain I have ever seen, it is insane. The only thing holding this back was the spotty animation in some parts, but this is as close to perfection a film can get. If I could take a pill to forget and watch this again fresh, I would overdose."
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie I’ve ever seen
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. Loved the little dog and the positive attitude. Loved the lessons taught.
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very cute kids movie.  It shows the importance of friendship, loyalty, and love."
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm not over exaggerating when I say that I can't recall laughing so hard at any production. Despite the great humour, puss in boots is film filled with a wonderful animation, unique-styled battles, and a great antagonist. And of course - there's a deeper, important message underneath, something we can expect from a DreamWorks production. Although I already had my favourite film of 2022, Puss steals its place in style!"
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fucking elite movie, Kitty Softpaws can get it."
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie has set the new bar in animation and storytelling for family. A must see for the adults and kiddos. Laughed, cried, applauded. Other studios must take notes!"
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than Avatar 2
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots is literally one of the greatest movies I've ever watched! It's hilarious, tearjerking, and intense. Death is such a perfect written villain! Out of all Shrek movies, this is way better!"
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Story line Was absolutely Amazing, tons of characters who somehow all have enough screen time and story line payoffs. The Villain was absolutely incredible. Please give this film your time"
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie made it to my top favorites list. Weirdly enough because my favorite genre is Horror. But this movie was 10/10 AMAZING!! my husband and I both enjoyed it and we don't even have kids so we watched it out of random. 😂
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,one of the best animated movies in 2022-2023
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the best animated movie I have seen in a while and the most engaging one as I truly felt like I was in the world of this movie whilst I was watching it and also quite sad to see it end because I want there to be more of this story.
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun filled, lots of references to other stories made it hilarious. Grandson cracked up so many times"
"Jan 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was cute and a fun time without some of word Hollywood pandering or messaging. The humor was so-so but it was fun overall. Death was a great villain and the issue Puss’ was struggling with made for some good writing. John Mulaney’s character was horrendous; just a terrible job voice acting without adding much to the movie.
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"great movie ! great for the family, lots of references to old characters and story tales"
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a good movie and funny
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"As an adult, this movie was overall good. The kids really enjoyed it, which is all that truly matters!"
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Aesome and realy cool
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,THIS IS CINEMA <<<333
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fire flames movie, watch it"
"Jan 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,Puss in Boots is not one of my favorite characters but the story was ok.
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie so much. The characters, cinematography, everything about this movie was amazing"
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,O filme é muito bom a animação ficou genial e o vilão ficou incrível nota 10/10
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a great kids movie. Teeny bit scary in a couple of parts, but it wasnt preachy, and didnt try to be anything other than a really fun, enjoyable family movie. Which was exceptionally refreshing. Highly recommended.  And funny!"
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Really fun movie to watch!
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"A movie full of colour, with incredible animation (I mean INCREDIBLE) and a very interesting and engaging plot for both children and adults. It also touches upon some heavy themes, like death and belonging, in the best way I could've ever asked.
Not to spoil anything but I'm also so happy to see a bad guy that's inherently bad, not ""misunderstood"" or ""vengeful"" or anything like that. just plain bad.
Would've given it 6 stars if I could."
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Who is your favorite fearless hero?
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,It's one of the best films I've ever seen. Exciting and funny from the start.
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,I must say that there were some slick visuals. It was very much like Spider-Man into the first had on this film.
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is a masterpiece. Every moment of the movie is entertaining and interesting, you won't be bored for a second. The animation is outstanding, it looks beautiful. The characters are extremely charming and you really care about them. The story is just perfect and the development of the characters too. One of the best movies of 2023."
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"It had character arcs, action, romance, style, humor, solid animation, great choreography, fun music. Honestly, the best movie Ive seen in a while, period."
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie surprised the hell out of me! What I was expecting was a simple children's story with heroes and villains; what I got was a foray into deep concepts which require more than a single viewing to unpack. 

I honestly cannot recommend this film enough"
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"It has a new and innoving animation. The plot is good and the character has an incredible evolution. And I love that the character of the Death is like Darth Vader, doesn't  appears more than 8 minutes but it has became iconic. Can't wait to see Shrek 5."
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Cute characters, awesome graphics."
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie for all ages.  Loved it!!!!
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was phenomenal, the story is perfect, the plot is perfect, the villains are perfect, the antagonist is perfect, the side characters are perfect, the animation is perfect, the ending is perfect everything is PERFECT."
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,I want to see the next story about goldi and the three bears with the team friendship
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Very fun show and nice prequel to another Shrek Movie? Good character development and suitable for all ages
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Very heavy anime influence and a very fun film.
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Brought my 9-year-old because she is a huge fan of the franchise. We both found it very entertaining. Interestingly, they have evolved the animation for the film from previous. With the action sequences specifically, the motion isn't always super-smooth. It felt a little like anime rather than the traditional DreamWorks Animation style. I personally appreciated the creative change (I could tell that my daughter did too, she likes anime shows). Also, I loved the story and thought that the ancillary characters were a lot of fun. Especially the people voicing them."
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Great animation with an endearing story and captivating scenes. It should be illegal how good a Dreamworks about a fairytale cat could be.
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,I had not watched a preview and chose this because it really was the kid friendly option. A dark theme and it pushed the boundaries or bad words for kids. Violent regularly. Rated properly for its content. Good music and visually pleasing.
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a brilliant movie ! I expected nothing, since I didn't even watch the first Puss in boots, nor remember the Shrek movies I've seen as a kid. I came just by curiosity and WAW I took a giant slap in the face. The animation is gorgeous, the combat scenes are breathtaking. The base of the plot are very simple, but the execution is flawless. The themes of death, family, friendship and courage are touching and the movie gave me tears. Not only tears of sadness, but of happiness and of ""Waw It's amazing.""
I've seen it 3 times already in theatre. Don't let the fact that's it's a ""Puss in boots"" movie fool you. I'ts one the best movies I've seen."
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Brought me so much nostalgia from my childhood and is my favorite move of 2022.
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Masterpiece. The story, the animation, the art style... everything is just perfect."
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a cute movie for kids. I enjoyed the animation and the storyline.
"Jan 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's sweet and entertaining.
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best villain since Darth Vader, Sauron and Voldemort."
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it best puss movie !
"Jan 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I went into the movie with high expectations after everyone praised it to be so good and it ended up being a 6.5/10 disappointment. Great visual style and animation, but the story and characters are pointless and cringe to sit through. There was one genuinely nice moment with Goldilocks and one funny moment with that abomination of a dog and that was pretty much it. Death was by far not as terrifying as everyone praised him to be. The German dub wasn't great either. I hate modern trends"
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"For what it does, this comes close to a perfect family movie!"
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is without any doubt, unironic my new favourite movie!"
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies I've ever seen! Animation, story, theme, everything was amazing and I can't wait to see what Dream Works does in Shrek 5!"

"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie of the year
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is amazing! the wolf is the most badass character of 2022, I loved the story and the stylized spider-verse oil painting animation. Go give this film your money! We need more like it"
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,A delight to the senses
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,It was perfect. Every second of it.
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was excellent! Funny, Smart, Emotional, cool, action,… all that and a bag of chips! I saw it with my 17 year old son and we.both loved it."
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfect... it's perfect
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Top 5 movie of all time for me
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Great kids show. Animation was excellent.

"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good characters, Really awesome animation. I honestly think the movie was elevated by the cast. I wasn't expecting much, but a good movie with good jokes."
"Jan 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,The fairytale characters were ridiculous. The storyline base is good and the little dog is adorable. Overall rating a C-
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie ever. No other words needed. ;)
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"funniest one ever

"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Peak cinema experience.
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,A little scary for the littles
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the best film in the Shrek universe. The story explores topics like anxiety and death. The animation has that awesome 2D style. And the characters are just incredible. 10/10 = Perfect
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best animation I have seen in years, it is beautiful. The story telling is amazing the plot is interesting and is conveyed in an amazing way."
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is amazing and breathtaking. I would recommend this movie to anyone who truly wants to experience a masterpiece. Throughout the 1 and a half hour of pure joy, I experienced all different types of emotions. A 100% watch for all movie lovers."

"Jan 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was cute a little over the top with cussing  my 4 year old and 7 yr old wanted to know why there was cussing. For the most part it was good very entertaining.
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible. One of the best animated movies of 2022.
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in boots has always been my favorite character so I knew I definitely had to see this movie as soon as possible and it did not disappoint. The animation was beautiful and I enjoyed the story a lot as well as the music (especially Fearless Hero, it's suck in my head)! The fight scenes were really cool too! I also really liked the main villain, he was actually scary. I loved his whistle/theme and I loved seeing him and Puss interact. I very much enjoyed seeing Puss's character development throughout the movie and it was really interesting seeing Puss actually afraid. It was nice seeing Kitty again and Perrito is such a sweetheart! This movie had the same charm and humor as the first one. I loved all the hidden details and foreshadowing. I will definitely re-watch it again and again, this is a new favorite for sure. I really hope to see Puss and the rest of team friendship again soon!"
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny and the play on words!
"Jan 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a little too long for the storyline.
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Great family movie with top grade animation.
"Jan 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great kids show. The fairy tale crossover took some getting used to but good over all. Good action kept movie flowing and unexpected ending was great!
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,This Is One Of If Not The Best Dreamworks Movie I've Ever Seen! So Good 10/10 Definitely Recommend!
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked everything about it, it’s amazing and it’s extremely interesting to watch. I would 100% pay to watch it again for the first time."

"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Assisti no cinema e é simplesmente lindo com um dos vilões mais assustadores dos ultimos tempos, poucas partes não são perfeitas nesse filme."
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,I'm not gonna say I cried during this movie but I also won't deny it. Such a good ride of a movie.
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Hilarious and entertaining
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"was not expecting a kids show to work through an existential crisis but good on them. lobo was intimidating, goldie and the three bears were heartwarming, and of course antonio banderas could read a phone book and i'd listen."
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,The plots twists were so unpredictable.
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"The animation is flawless, please make more!"
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Me and my son enjoyed this moviewe laughed so much.
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Great kids and family movie. Nice message
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Every character is interesting and the movie even has many aspects that appeal to older audiences.
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,El desarrollo del villano fue muy bueno
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"I haven't enjoyed an animated feature this much in a long time.  Great story line, beautiful animation and I needed a five-minute dance break during the credits.  So good!"
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie - although the death wolf was frightening for the 3 & 5 year old
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Its a very heart warming movie. Aside from being entertaining the movie can touch you with meaningful life lessons. Highly recommended.
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a breath of fresh air for the viewers and for Dreamworks, but besides that, this movie is great, the animation and the characters put me so deep into the story that I don't feel like I'm just a spectator, and it makes me so happy that Dreamworks remembers this franchise and has given us a wonderful delivery ;)."
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie! A lot of fun to watch.
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,This was an awesome well thought film. Truly a masterpiece. I cannot begin to describe the amount of detail that was put into this movie. Very humorous and entertaining. It's a 100/10
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,I made an account just to review this movie. WOW! For a children's movie this was incredibly good. I think everyone should go and see this masterpiece of a film.
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dreamwork didn't need to go this hard for a sequel to a spinoff from over a decade ago but DAMN!

The animation is stylistic, vibrant and gorgeous with animation that is inspired by the Spiderverse movies. Every frame is whacky and creative! The story is also wonderfully done despite the short runtime. It gives a very poignant and meaningful message to the audience. What surprised me the most though was the action scenes! Those action scenes are choreographed so well!

I don't like milking a franchise for over 20 years but this film gives me slight hope that the next entry might be worth watching."
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,The whole Movie was great
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,I like puss in boots from Shrek 2
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful movie, full of action, good story and incredible animation. highly recommended"
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,i made an account just to rate this movie 5 stars like its that good. im def gonna rewatch it again
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Go watch puss in Boots 2 NOW!!!
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quite possibly the best movie of 2022. Beautiful animation, excellent characterization, and a gripping plot. A film literally anybody can (and will) enjoy!"
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie!! Had some really funny moments & some good music
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,There was plenty of fun for adults.  Antonio Banderas does a great job with Puss.  The animation lent marvelous expressiveness to all of the key characters.
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,The graphics and story line were amazing💗10/10 ! Best animated movie ever for 2023💗🤍
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was, simply put, a masterpiece that helps bridge the gaps between the realities of death and the general population. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish simply does an amazing job of teaching all audiences of every age the complexities and lessons that come with accepting one's own mortality."
"Jan 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Should've stopped, because whatever it is that made the films in the franchise released prior to this have life among its corporate, well-refined, but still vapid sense of parody humour is completely missing from this. True emotion, perhaps? Either way, this did not need to be created and it doesn't have a reason to exist to support everyone else's decision to think that it did. Without error. This is from the guy who has intentionally low standards for things to remain fair in judgment. I'm not just going to like this solely because it's a Shrek spin-off. The first film, I would do. This is a sequel for a spin-off film from 2011, and even that one was outdated because it was extending from a franchise in which most of its films were released in the 2000s. It was already outdated for the progression of culture, intolerable enough for reasons that aren't being a spin-off just by itself. Add to something outdated by itself, however, and it ends up like this, with there being no attempt at being real with anything anymore and realising that the public eye has grown less capable of critical thinking."
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Great adults and kids all enjoyed the movie!
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,very very very very good
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie for kids and adults
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"adorava o primeiro gato de botas, tanto quando os filmes do Shrek, esse filme é apenas EXEPCIONAL"
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its about death, and John Mulaney is the monster he is irl"
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"A splendidly evil villain, a cute romantic subplot, and a quest that comes to a satisfying conclusion make Puss in Boots: The Last Wish a fantastic animated film that the entire family can enjoy. Brilliant visuals and stunningly beautiful animation coupled with a heartfelt story, free of cringe-worthy or woke dialogue, present a film reminiscent of the sorely-missed masterpieces Disney used to release. Dreamworks filmmakers gave audiences exactly what they've been yearning for in an animated feature that is both entertaining and meaningful for all ages."
"Jan 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was a good movie, but i do think that it isn’t as amazing or groundbreaking as some people made it seem. Still highly recommend for movie lovers."
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,IT WAS THE BEST MOVIE IVE SEEN IN SO LONG
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the the best Dreamworks movies of all time, after the first 2 HTTYD movies, Prince of Egypt, and Kung Fu Panda 2."
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Puss and boots movies are just all equally stellar
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best Shrek movie since Shrek 2! perfect remaining of Fairy tales characters in a Zorro style comedy adventure. The Villiains ate top tier including Death! Goldi and the Bears are charming and Big Jack Honer stole the show as the true Big Bad. 

Best DreamWorks film in ages."
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the lessons and the antagonist. And the animation was amazing! I'm definitely rewatching this many times.
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie!!!! Had insane animation and very likable characters. Also death wolf was very hot........
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,The best suprise of the year.
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Film straordinario, uno dei film di animazione piu' belli che ho mai visto !!"
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is a must-see film for fans of the beloved feline hero. The animation is stunning, the voice acting is top-notch, and the story is both action-packed and emotionally resonant. The filmmakers have done an excellent job of expanding on the characters and world established in the ""Shrek"" franchise, while still making the film accessible to new audiences. The humor is clever and appeals to both children and adults, and the themes of friendship and loyalty are beautifully portrayed. Overall, ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is a cinematic treat that should not be missed. 5 out of 5 stars."
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a fantastic dip back into the magical works of Dreamworks animation and a brilliant examination of mortality and expectations. The movie leaves the viewer satisfied and excited to see what comes next from Dreamworks. Great humor, great plot, amazing animation, and lovable characters. 10/10."
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Watched it, no one in the theater room didnt cry at least once or laughted during this movie, it connects with all generations and honestly is a masterpice of animation, i would take off my hat for those responsible for this, rrally considering going to see it again on theather because of how amazing puss in boots 2 is, the wolf representing death is honestly scary, the message of enjoyng the small things in life and not be greedy is epic, just a great movie if i could give it 6 stars i would"
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's animation style was spectacular and the action sequences was pretty impressive, just like Spiderman into the Spiderverse."
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Impression of PUSS IN BOOTS 2 --
Don't blow this off.  I know, I know, a week ago I'd never have thought I needed to see this kids' movie but everyone's been saying ""It's incredible"", ""Best animated film I've seen all year"" and ""Best picture of 2022!"" Got it.  Then they grab me, trembling, ""If you don't see it in a theater you'll never forgive yourself!""  So I saw it and... good Lord, it's amazing!  I knew Avatar would be visually spectacular, but this little sequel, it's so funny, so innovative in its animation (Spiderverse has launched a revolution in jazz-like style), so engaging in a story that seems lighthearted at first but really tugs at you by the end.  I can't think of a moment that wasn't perfect.  That's right.  It's perfect.  I wouldn't change a single frame.
Every aspect of this fairy tale contributes, from evil Jack Horner (horrid freak) to Goldie and her three-bear crime family, but ever-on-his-heels (er, paws) is a bounty hunter with red glowering eyes that... I won't spoil it for you, but the film hints at Cervante's Don Quixote and his helper Sancho, valiantly trying to preserve himself, his model of being a hero, but the world is suggesting he's a relic.  There's a metaphoric death of the dashing swordsman, but something better is born.  All the while you're laughing at every scene.  It's a triumph.
Special mention goes to Perro, the little dog-dressed-as-a-cat helper (like Sancho Panza).  This side story of being yourself, winning by not opposing, victory by being incredibly naive or believing in the best at all times, it's a masterful stroke that adds to this ridiculously stunning work of perfection!  Perro's animators and story writers should get Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars.  Now get to a theater before it leaves, you'll be begging everyone to see it as well!"
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"With an animaton style continuing the great work of The Bad Guys and an emotional story about facing the one thing you can't beat, this movie appeals to both adults and children as a genuine tale of what it means to face your fears.

Every characters arc is excellent, from Puss and Kitty through to Goldilocks and the Three Bears.  Also an awesome antagonist which was the perfect representation of the fear most have.

The fact it made the kids laugh and be a little scared, without making them terrified, and made adults talk about whether they fear death means the story has resonated.

Watch it.  Again.  And again.  You will not be disappointed."
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome animation and a great message!  Well done Dreamworks!
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Kids loved it (ages 8 and 6), and I was able to find some adult-centered humor as well. There were some parts that were a bit scary for the youngest, but she was able to troop through."
"Jan 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Core problem was the nightmare material in this movie for younger kids (~7 and under).  The 2 villains are very dark, so much so that younger kids may cry during and get nightmares after watching.

Maybe your kid is old enough for this material, if so please disregard.  I have one 6 and one 10.  The 10 yr old enjoyed, the 6 yr old cried and is still freaked out of the dark now (wasn't before).  

Personally, I think DreamWorks scriptwriter should punch themself for this content.

Without giving away too much, the 2 villains are unstoppable embodied death (embodied as a stalker wolf with scythes) and a psychopathic murderer who shoots people.

Not sure what the creative team was thinking, but this seems unnecessarily dark and brooding.  The sociopath murderer was twisted, but the death wolf -- every time he appears, Puss (protagonist) has a panic attack.

As a fan of kids animation, there is a fine line where jokes / story may go over kids heads & is meant for adults, or times the kids get it and then have a lot of confusion trying to interpret.  This was pronounced here.  The moral of the story could have been delivered without traumatizing the youngest in the audience.

I've spoken to other parents, some had to take their youngest kids crying out of the theater, many had to deal with crying scared kids & try to sit thru the movie.

Go F Yourself, DreamWorks!!"
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Took the family to the drive INS to see this movie, better than the 1st actually funny for everyone kids & adults."
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"really good movie, plot has a lot of depth and nostalgia. Every character is complex enough and movie has something for every age"
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a homerun for Dreamworks. Art style and animation are on point, characters are all insanely well designed and voiced, and while the story is generally what you'd expect from a fantasy kids movie, it's still more than enticing enough to keep you hooked the entire time."
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible in every way. Must watch cinema for all ages.
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved everything except the change of the style (all the jokes were way funnier when the style was more realistic, and every time a joke occured I imagiened how much funnier it would be if it was still silly realistic)."
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Once again, another great movie about Puss. Especially with the hint at the end of the movie! GO SEE IT!!!!!"
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"An unexpected masterpiece, holy!"
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is so amazing. I went into this movie thinking it as a comedy movie but what i got out of it is much more. The emotional scenes and fight scenes, and most importantly the characters and their develop throughout the film. This is 100% must watch and all i am saying is that this movie has the best antagonist i have ever seen beside Lord Shen."
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me and my sister loved it, its a 10/10 dreamworks did their thing 👏👏👏"
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything is just right!
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,WHY TF IS THIS MOVIE SO GOOD ITS PUSS IN BOOTS LIKE THE FIRST ONE WAS ALRIGHT BUT NOT ANYTHING LIKE THIS
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"The film transmit between subjects that are not so common for cartoons, but that teach real lessons, those to take to life. In addition, of course, to bringing in a magical setting several reflections"
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well, that was unexpectedly fantastic! I created an account here just so I can give my sincere thanks to the creators, and encourage DreamWorks studios to continue making movies like THIS. You can feel the love and attention pouring from every frame of this spectacle. Everyone involved in the writing, direction, character design, animation, and sound, everyone clearly gave their all to deliver the best movie they could. I could tell from the very first minute I was in for something special. This is one of the movies that will unironically change lives. Please, go see it. Support the creators and let our voices be heard, this is the kind of film we want to see in theaters, this is what we as the audience appreciate and what we call the art of moviemaking."
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"love it. great movie.
非常喜欢，很棒的电影。"
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Peak. Cinema. At. It's. Best.
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Love that spunky little cat. His ending up at the cat lady's house was hilarious. Worked well and was enjoyable.
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fucking amazing, went to a late night showing at 9:40pm to distract myself and take my mind of putting a gun in my mouth, and it worked it was an amazing movie and an amazing soundtrack with great characters"
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,very colorful and entertaining
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"When I went to watch this movie I had high hopes. When I walked out of the theater I found my hopes blown out of the water. During the first action sequence I was taken aback by the quality of the animation. For me, the animation was most similar to what I had seen in Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse, but it was executed in such a unique way by alternating between being animated on 2's for the action sequences and being animated at full fps for the dialogue and subtle interactions. The fight choreography and dynamic camera movement, while being chaotic, never left my eyes wondering where to look. 

In terms of the story, it approached complex and difficult questions, like the concept of mortality and the value of your own life, or what it means to be family, and it served me the answer with ketchup and fries. It made big questions easy to understand. The topics and themes were definitely mature, but would still be understandable for younger audiences.

Each of the characters were as unique and interesting as I've come to expect from Dream Works. The Last Wish really shows the difference between a ""Villain"" and an ""Antagonist"".

On a less positive note, it seems the furries have gotten attached to the wolf character... Oh, well."
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Big Jack Horner is the greatest villain in the history of film.
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Heck yeah!!! Puss in Boots is literally what I miss with old cartoon movies, and they nailed it perfectly. Thank you Dreamworks, bravo!!!👏👏"
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"An astounding cartoon. Spectacular animation, appealing characters, a great story. Perhaps the best movie I have seen in the past year, and I have seen many fine movies this year. Not for young children though the images are far too intense. But for older ones and adults, even without kids, perfect"
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"The animation, the writing, the direction. Everything falls in place so perfectly. My only issue is that we didn't really get to see much more of Goldilocks' relationship and issues with her family. It felt like it was squished in there near the end. It had a good build up but they didn't spend enough time on the actual conflict. Other than that, this movie is beautiful. It handles the character development in such a mature way. Puss struggling to deal with his anxiety and fear of death is written so well. I know I wasn't the only one to start crying during the scene where he has a panic attack. As someone who struggles with anxiety it felt so much more accurate than a lot of the depictions I've seen before. I hope DreamWorks continues to produce movies like this. 9.7/10"
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Sweet movie with a clever story and great animation and charming characters. Really what more could you want?
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Probably the best dreamwork’s movie so far. The animation was great and the story was just right.
"Jan 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,I prefer old animation style
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Easily the best movie of 2023, and it is only January. All Im saying is, Mario better bring it hard if it wants to beat this one out because Puss was FANTASTIC! It took all the fairy tale humor and magic that makes the Shrek movies amazing and brought it back. As someone who grew up watching the Shrek movies, this was like a trip back to my childhood. Like I stepped through a portal and became a kid again. Puss is an amazing character, the story and supporting characters are great, and (spoilers) some of those Death scenes were actually pretty scary. They also included the mild language too, was worried they would water it down and not have that but they pulled through and had it. All in all, great movie, great experience, a certified Dreamworks classic! P.S. was that a Shrek 5 teaser at the end?? I think so and it just makes it all that much better."
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,doooo do doooo de doooo duuuuu... duuuuu de diiiiiii de doooooiiio
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"It ever so quickly changes from another film of a funny loveable cat to a touching story as we witness Puss try to escape his fate after taking his lives for granted, 
to try and escape death is to live a life of denial land fear. We experience the beauty of life not in spite of, but because of our inevitable morality. The world can be horrid and people can be disgustingly cruel, but it's the relationships and adventures we embrace that makes living worthwhile, to enjoy the rewards of being loved we must submit ourselves to the mortifying ordeal of being known."
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,ME ENCANTO! Dreamworks se lucio este año. Con Bad guys mostro un estilo artistico bello y con esta pelicula experimental como hizo Spiderman hace un par de años atras. El Lobo feroz es uno o el mejor villano del studio y deja otra secuela mejor que la primera como Dreamworks sabe hacer. Ojala el estudio se decante mas por estas peliculas que con peliculas como boss baby
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic animation and storyline overall. A must see!
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"I cannot express how good this movie is. It got me in the feels, made me laugh hard enough to hurt my chest and the animation and painterly style of the film is absolutely stunning. I'll be talking about this movie in the same breath as Spiderverse forever."
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a cute storyline. Absolutely loved it.
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Great plot and funny characters! We enjoyed it as much as the kids!
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss In Boots embraces what made the Shrek series so timeless in that taking classic childhood charm, a few naughty under-the-radar jokes mixed in with strong key themes works wonders like a true fairytale"
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,o melhor filme da dreawors de todos eo melhor filme de 2022
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie has stunning animation, beautiful set and character designs, a creative  and well thought out story, i did not dislike a single character, TWO examples of found family, and also the cat has eyeliner. Probably the best movie of the past decade at LEAST."
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was absolutely, without a doubt, in my opinion, the best movie that was released in 2022, which on it's own says a lot about how I feel concerning the film. The animation was fantastic, the script was fantastic, and it all culminated together to be very high up among DreamWorks' best films. If you haven't watched it already, then go and do so, it blew everyone's expectations out of the water, I honestly wasn't expecting to have such a positive opinion about this film, with mostly nostalgia just initially leading me to the theatre, but lo and behold, it became a movie which I can, without a doubt, easily set high up as one of my topmost favorites."
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Feel good movie with great animation & characters. Good story, good music--a good time!"
"Jan 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,Got to theater our seats were taken. We got differents seats. more tham half way through the movie we were asked to move which we did. Usher sounded like we were lying. we will not return
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfectly made! Entertainment for the whole family
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Probably the best movie based on the shrek world.
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought a decade wait might steal Puss' shine, but The Last Wish is a well written and visually great family film. The wolf character is a favorite addition with his whistle and his voice. Nice to have a great moral and friendship theme."
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved every second of this film, I was even tearing up. Best animated film Ive seen in a couple years."
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, great music, fantastic scenes"
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"THIS WAS FIRE, CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE 10/10 WOULD RECOMMEND"
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Oh my God. Holy crap. Holy freaking crap.

Ok first of all, the pacing? Immaculate. Story? Life-changing. After seeing the first Puss in Boots and now this, it's safe to say that the animation — and the characters — had IMMENSE glow-up in look. The colors, the scenery, even subtle changes in character design were absolutely phenomenal. This movie is a must see, ESPECIALLY if you have an appreciation for art and animation. 5/5 movie. Would rate 10 if possible."
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,this is the best movie i have everseen! this guy is my childhood i wish to watch it in cinema but ill just prefer sflix to watch puss in boots:D
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Muito bom história  dinâmica  excelente
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Actually an amazing movie. Thought people were hyping it up for some reason but genuinely had everything for a quick family movie.
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"amazing story, good art. overall poggers"
"Jan 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honesntly, a near perfect if not perfect movie. So phenomenal that I had to make an account just to give it 5 stars it deserves to convince everyone to go watch it. You won't regret watching it."
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is a good sequel, it expands the story of this character that easily likes. The change in animation is a plus point and its history leaves great lessons of life."
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,i loved this so much you have no idea. i think this is the best movie i have ever seen in my life 😭
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome animation villain was so good 
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Who is your favorite fearless hero?!
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,There is a cat. What else do you need?
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Grandbabies loved it!!!
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,MASTERPIECE! Only that!
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,perfecta como para niños como para los adultos que crecimos con sherk y el gato
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie does a great job on so many levels. The music and animation style does so well at depicting recurring themes throughout the movie. It has a great message and you don't need to watch the previous movies in the series to enjoy.
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,The villains was perfect. Great character development
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme e divertindo, sensível e da para tirar umas boas risadas, recomendo para toda a família."

"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie I've seen in a decade
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,We entered the theatre with low expectations & we Came out and was completely overwhelmed with this masterpiece!!! Really loved it and had a good laugh!!!
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun for the whole family… surprised by how much I liked it
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,The animation for this movie was off the charts! I love Antonio Banderas and Selma Hayek in the starring roles. The moral(s) of the story can be found when you watch the movie itself and determine where they fall in your life. I think Dreamworks is giving the other animation companies a run for their money. Not sure it's especially something I would take small children to. Tweens at the earliest. There are dark moments that might scare some youngsters.
"Jan 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The 2D and 3D got a little confusing. And wow promoting bad language with emotions is something that surprises me  boots was OK they all look like clay figures
But yeah lots of mixed emotions for me."
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,death wolf was the best villain. his prescience hits deferent
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Very funny and enjoyable to watch. Great animation tied with a fantastic lesson.
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,incredible! this is entertainment for kids... mine where amazed and hypnotized  by such a good story..

"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Way better than you think it would be go watch
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was great and the end credit can we see Sherk and donkey again!!
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"No me esperaba lo buena que llego a ser, se merece todas las estrellada. Muy recomendable."
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,what a amazing movie
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of my favorite films from Dreamworks.  Improved upon the first film a lot, with humor and heart."
"Jan 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good story teaches morals
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"I feel like that I always give huge ratings to content that I enjoy. But, I was someone who was not asking for a sequel to a Puss and Boots movie. This one brings such a unique style than the first one. I love ""Spider-Verse"" style animation and plot for this film. The fairy-tale characters work well and the wolf is my favorite Shrek villain. After this movie I would definitely watch a Shrek 5. I didn't know I would say that, but that is how much I enjoyed this movie."
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"this. is. SO GOOD!!!!!!!!!11!!!!!!!!1!!!!!!!!!!!!1 YOU HAVE TO GO SEE THIS!
its gorgeous art style, its great story, its great villains, everything is done so well and is freaking amazing! Edit: I heard that people think death is ""too scary for children"" and as a kid myself, if your kid is afraid of death in this movie your a terrible parent. kids should be allowed to learn about these things and learn to deal with them in a healthy way. death, pain, heartbreak and sadness are not foreign to kids and not letting your kid learn about how to cope with these things in a healthy way, it could lead to depression or worse. please dont refuse to let your kid watch things like this movie just because you think it would be too scary."
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best movie of all times
Super musical score 
Super character 
Super villains 
The best animation i have ever seen
This movie is a must watch even as a standalone F**king love it."
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie, the colors, the animation, the fights
it is a must see!"
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Best animated movie I have ever seen hands down
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"The fact they were able to make a 36 yr old grown man tense up every time the Wolf, or Death, came on the screen, was so well done.  The animation was top level as well, definitely a visual upgrade from previous iterations in the Puss in Boots & Shrek cinematic universe.  Finally, this movie has a great message behind it"
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolute masterpiece!
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a phenomenal movie, for any audience old or young. I was entertained throughout the whole duration of this film, from the story, characters, set pieces and the superb animation. I was also surprised at how they tackled the topic of anxiety and it's effects, something you would not expect from a children's movie. As someone that has dealt with anxiety for most of their life, a lot of scenes hit close to home for me and I have to say it was handled perfectly. This movie is full to the brim with emotional moments, high octane set pieces and fight choreography that rivals the likes of anime shows like Demon Slayer. I cannot recommend this movie enough, and hopefully it will leave a lasting impression on you as it has done so for me"
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie of the YEAR. The emotions this movie made me feel I just did not expect from a puss in boots movie. All the characters were given plenty of screen time, the themes explored in this movie are fantastic. Great pacing, but one character definitely steals the show EVERY TIME there on screen. A MUST watch film."
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,This is just too good
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was amazing. Some could even say perfect. Stakes were high and it had a good story. It also has some of Spider-Verses animation style at some scenes that were intense. I do kind of Miss Humpty Dumpty though. But Kitty softpaws and the dog were cool. This is my favorite animated movie of the year and if you don't watch this, you are missing out on so much."
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Went in with 0 expectations, left out compelled by the quality and wanting to watch it again. And that villain! What a great one."
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"O roteiro é de uma certa forma original e o filme traz cenas totalmente diferente do que estamos acostumados com o universo de Shrek. Cenas emocionantes e arrepiantes até, do começo ao fim."
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was amazing, csn pause on any scene and it is like a painting. It looks like they took inspiration from into the spider verse. Movie tackles with mortality really well and executes animation perfectly. 10/10 I would watch again."
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Just proves Dreamworks > Disney
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"The only thing wrong with this movie was the underprepared release date. It was overshadowed by many other movies such as Avatar, Guillermo's Pinocchio etc. I love how Dreamworks and other studios similar have realised that animation isn't about being hyper-surrealistic, it's about genuine visual storytelling through art. Studios are remembering that animation isn't a genre, it's a medium for visual storytelling. And I can't believe how Dreamworks managed to pull off a children's movie with three villains?? Great stuff Dreamworks. Can't wait to see this hybrid animation implemented into Kung Fu Panda."
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love how they chose a predictable plot, but with lots of twist and fun way of giving life values and lessons for every group of awesome characters along the way, it's very creative and entertaining."
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"There is no reason for a sequel to a spinoff of god damn Shrek to be so good, but here we are. 10/10"
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Such an exciting movie! The animation draws you in and the fight scenes are just immaculate. This has to be one of the best kids movies of all time! What a way to start 2023 with this.
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,The best animated movie i've seen after kung fu panda 3
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,bro thats the best movie i have seen in years. actually i thought it is going to ruin the puss in boots sequel BUT IT MADE IT 10x BETTER. THATS A MUST WATCH
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed this movie. Story was good with action and comedy, lots of fun!!"
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, amazing animation and writing all around."
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE +_+ keep making movies like these, no genderswap characters or character sexuality swapped....this movie was perfect"
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"the animation used every asset to its full potential, adding to the amazing story using trust and fear to captivate the audience, with multiple characters that have plot twists to keep people on the edge of their seat. bringing back an old, worn out Puss in Boots, fearful of losing his last life, bringing the audience closer to the character and sustained throughout the whole movie"
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie has a critical story with a deep explanation which helps the audience know what the definition is about with context. I watched this in the movie theater and turned out that the movie is incredibly good and how well the writer seriously focuses on this story helps the audience keep interested and is less bored. My rate is 10/10 for an excellent job. Well done, guys! Also I am willing to keep watching this over and over again."
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely loved it!!!
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,one of the best movies of 2022-2023 plus this my be the year for DreamWorks
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,A good movie never expected to see a sequel and totally a wholesome family movie where every age can watch and enjoy.
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,The animation is so fun and the characters and story is amazing! Animation isn't just for kids!!!! It's cinema!!!! Puss In Boots 2 is a must watch!!!
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was absolutely amazing. Some of the best themes and characters I've seen in a movie, a kids PUSS IN BOOTS movie, in years. And the animation was just wonderful. There were a lot of characters, but not so many that you couldn't keep track. And each character was so amazing and perfect for their role, and I know everyone is going crazy about death but jack horner was honestly a better villain just because of the lack of give a crap about others. He is a peak comedic villain. No one character got any more or less screen time then they should've, and everything was just masterfully crafted. And the ANIMATION? Don't get me started. Please give it a watch, and in THEATERS, so you can actually support the amazing dreamworks team that created this."
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than I was expecting. I wasn’t that excited to see it but it was worth it.
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Great film!!! You do not need to see the previous puss in boots movies to enjoy this one!
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Preciosa, muy tierna"
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,My daughter loved it. Very nice animation. Unexpectedly good.
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the proper way to revise a franchise. Intense, emotional, beautiful, this movie excels in every way"
"Jan 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was ok. The kids liked which is what matters most.
"Jan 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very boring and not great animation it being 3D.
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"A melhor animação que assisti neste ano, foi muito boa, mesclando várias situações do Gato de Botas em uma aventura épica!"
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,A great movie that's far deeper than I anticipated.
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of my favorite movies of the year and probably the best animated movie I've ever seen, if I could I'd give it an extra star. Truly just an amazing movie and they did puss n boots justice with his sequel."
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pura masterpiece, o vilão então nem se fala 🐺👹"
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a great movie the animation was superb!!!
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Second best movie of all time, I mean like come on this stupid children's movie about a cat that wears boots scared me. And uhhh I would say that is sad but looking around quite a few people did get scared. But to be honest the fact that I get scared honestly makes the movie better and more fun which is great. So, I give this movie a 10/10 absolutely must watch this movie, just a great, amazing movie. I would sell my left kidney to watch this movie again, I can only say that about one other movie."
"Jan 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,Genuinely way more fun than I expected.
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't bother too rate movies 

This one did"
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme simplesmente perfeito em tudo, simplesmente incrível."
"Jan 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Por primera vez en más de una década,
DreamWorks Animation presenta una nueva
aventura en el universo de Shrek. Aunque la trama
es muy predecible logra entretener y no aburrir al
espectador en ningún momento. Creo que más que
la trama es la animación con tintes de historieta la
que logra esto,muy parecido a lo visto en spiderman
a New universe (2018) de Sony.
Me gusto ver de regreso a este personaje con
muchos guiños a historias de cuentos de hadas y
del universo de Shrek.
Maneja temas maduros cómo la muerte y el trauma
infantil de una manera muy ligera para un niño,
además de contar con los personajes y villanos
bien desarrollados.
Nos dejá con una gran lección sobre la vida y la
muerte algo muy parecido a Pinocchio (2022) de
Guillermo del Toro.
Creo que no es una película innovadora pero que
funciona para disfrutar en familia.
La volvería a ver un domingo cuando este
disponible en alguna plataforma de streaming, pero
mientras tanto,estaré esperando el siguiente
movimiento de DreamWorks sobre el universo de
Shrek."
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"A masterpiece, a sequel better than the original! It's something rare but it's true."
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Funny, enjoyable, and just great overall"
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Just watched Puss in boots last wish in the cinema thoroughly enjoyed it I can definitely say it’s better than the first Shrek movie thoroughly enjoyed it I would give it 4.5 out of 5

"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic film. From the fun story to the gorgeous design, it really hits a solid 10/10 for me! It's certainly become a new favourite film of mine."
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,This is probably the best movie I've seen in years. I bought it digitally kmmediately after watching it in the theater. I've seen it 5 times since.
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's Amazing, the wolf dubbing is impeccable, the plot and characters are captivating, dreamworks made an amazing movie."
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Go watch it at any local movie theater me and my daughter saw it and loved it. We are hoping for another sequel as the movie was that enjoyable and better than Avatar in terms of a fun story. Avatar is great visually but dollar for dollar the story in ""Puss in Boots The last wish"" was much better. The intro of the movie was a absolute wow now thats a start. Its a great family movie not woke or anything no suggestible or questionable themes or characters.  Just wholesome family movie for everyone. Its like where the movies left off from Shrek and the whole puss in boots spinoff movie and tv show previously and this one is now one of the greats. I recommend you go see it. Get your popcorn drink hotdogs and nachos on! Support the movie studio and crew and your local favorite movie theaters as this is the movie to watch if your a Shrek universe lover or want a family friendly movie. You will be glad your saw this movie and be wanting another sequel like we did. I will be buying the Blueray copy!"
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie I've ever seen
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Top 10 movie of 2022, no cap"
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"brilliant movie, down to the animation and messages. tackled subjects such as mortality and anxiety in fresh way"
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"genuinely one of the best movies i have seen in a long time, tackling very tough themes especially for a children's movie, fear, anxiety, and learning to trust are all themes this movie tackled. please watch this movie."
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Every new character is fun, and the film is constantly entertaining as well as heartwarming."
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Nostalgic! 
I love this movie. It might be just me but I don't find any reason why not to love this movie, it shows great representation of their characters and I do not find any bit of clip boring. If you're a fan of Dreamworks, this movie will not disappoint you."
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"After 11 years, there's a sequel!!!"
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic movie. Great to see that the animation trend pushed by Spiderverse and Arcane is continuing strong! Amazing storytelling and cinematography, pulls off excellent comedy while having a very emotional and engaging story."
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny and fun and great animation. A movie grandkids can love and the grandparents can too
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,el renacer de estas peliculas
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the second best that will come out this year (Cocaine Bear is obviously number 1) It has a very nice plot and has one of if not the best Dreamworks villain of all time. I also like The hot black cat.
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolute Masterpiece
"Jan 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a good time for me and my family. Very entertaining. I loved the animation.
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,This was better than expected. Wholesome and pulls on the heart strings.
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely incredible movie that had no right to be that good. Easily one of Dreamworks best productions. Humerous, great plot, incredible character arcs, and stunning graphics. Deals with the topic of death and mortality very well especially for a kids movie. Character designs were also spectacular (I especially loved Goldilocks) Overall I can't think of a single flaw this movie had. I never buy movies but I just might have to so I can rewatch it whenever. That's how good it is. Seriously watch it."
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie is by far the best movie of 2022 i adore it
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"My fiance and I literally watched it yesterday. We looked at what was available at our local theater which was Wakanda Forever, Babylon, Puss in Boots 2, I Wanna Dance with Somebody, and Avatar 2. We went with the highest review (Audience and Critic) and watched Puss in Boots 2. This movie was so damn good and it was surprising that a kid's movie was ""Kids first, Adult second"" which is something Disney is tripping on. The new character additions were great, truthfully I thought Perro was going to be the generic annoying character but he ended up being enjoyable when he was on screen. Please go watch the movie, it's really good."
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked it, it's one of my favorite dolls"
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was really good I rented it on my Xbox definitely amazing especially the wolf 🐺  u need to check it out
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,AWEESOMMEEEEE!!!!!!!!!
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really good writing, beautiful animation. It has everything, definitely a must see."
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was quite an unexpected adventure. A movie made for children that taps on very mature themes, while delivering a fun story with a gorgeous animation."
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"eu fiquei muito emocionado com o filme, que eu sai do cinema chorando"
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish excels in its genre as an animated movie. Dreamworks orchestrated one of, if not the best, animated movie of 2022. The animation and effects styles are truly mesmerizing to watch on screen. The central theme of the movie is one that each and every one of us can apply in our own lives, making this movie an instant classic for years to come. If you don't believe me, go see it for yourself."
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked that I could take a child.
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was expecting a decent movie, what I've got was an outstanding show with great story."
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Eu achei o filme lindo e com uma ótima animação, mas certas vezes a história se torna previsível. Falando sobre o Lobo ele está ótimo e toda vez que ele aparece me dá um arrepio e aquele assobio que da medo em mim nota 9,5/10"
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"how does a PUSS IN BOOTS movie hit so hard on its themes? like, for real. And don't ever get me started on the wolf, i couldn't breave properly when he was in scene."
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"EXTREMELY good movie,death is such a good villain and everything is just really well done,from the characters to the animation,everything."
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie has an amazing story and the theme is so serious and well done, also the villain is the best I've ever seen in a cartoon."
"Jan 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie should have been rated PG13. I had a 4 yr old and a 7 yr old. It was NOT maybe for young kids. Beeping out curse words was NOT what I thought Disney would make a Movie like this.
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,absolutely fantastic i cried multiple times
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent graphics, Hilarious humor for both children and adults. Absolutely loved watching this with my kids 🤗"
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing animation. Fun story. Great cast.
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a long wait, 11 years, from the first movie, and it feels like the narratives and comedy of Dreamworks has matured as you would expect it to in that time. Gone are the cheap bits at shock humor that haunted Shrek entries and especially tone-deaf in the Kung Fu Panda trilogy, replaced with mature humor that will strike a note with audiences of all ages. Similarly, the narrative has grown up, a thrilling tale of confronting one's own mortality and the fear of death itself. This movie takes risks not only in its animation style, but its plot and humor as well, and every single gamble Dreamworks made paid off 100 fold. Watch this movie."
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Never thought I'd fall in love with an animated film again but here I am. A must-watch!
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Such an amazing movie. Had the perfect amount of action balanced with humor. And the villain was super cool! 
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Animation is top notch and the movie is a lot of fun from start to finish
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"oh my goodness, that was great"
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,The animation was amazing and the story was actually really intriguing and in depth.
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Took my 4yo and she loved it too.
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"I figured this would just be a soulless cash grab but it was far better than it had a right to be. They borrowed a lot from the animation style used in Spider-Verse and the Bad Guys, but it really works with the fairy tale setting. Pacing needed a little work and some of the jokes just didn't land, but overall it was very good."
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,My son loved it and me too!!!
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Everything about Puss in Boots was pure perfection.

From the stylish animation, sound design, story, and many more -- It was a memorable and exciting adventure all the way through.

It is honestly worthy of multiple watches."
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,This cat in shoes movie was very spectacular!
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,god this was such a breath of fresh air! the animation is gorgeous and you can feel all of the love put into every aspect of it
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"this movie really surprised me! it was a lot better than i thought it would be. not really any boring scenes, pacing was good. honestly the villain was so good and refreshing and was nice to see a bad guy be bad just because. my only complaint is it doesnt feel like this is in the shrek universe, feels like it belongs in encanto more. and the style is unique but i think i still prefer the original style better. but story wise its very good!"
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it the humor was effortless and fun for the whole family , definitely some adult level jokes in there and kept me entertained from start to finish!!!"
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"Totally exceeded my expectations. I was expecting something great, not an entire masterpiece! This movie will hit you in the feels and shows the importance of life. Couldn't ask for anything more in this movie."
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Best dream works movie since shrek 2
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"A genuine must see for any demographic. I can't remember the last time I thoroughly enjoyed a movie as much as this one, either in theaters or otherwise. It is filled with clever humor, delicate and captivating storytelling, and one of the best villains I have ever seen in a ""kids""/animated movie. I rarely watch movies more than once, let alone pay for another watch, but I already have tickets to a second showing."
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"My kids loved it! It was super cute, had a great story line and Puss was hilarious"
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was the best what a great way to brink back a legend and introduce new characters. Death was easily the greatest villain ever in the movie and in all of dreamworks, I hope we see him again soon in the future"
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,The animation is just amazing I absolutely love it. And omg death such and amazing character. Must see!!
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Didn’t think this would surpass the original but this sequel was better than the original and really enjoyed this movie.
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,WATCH THIS MOVIE ITS SO GOOD AND HAS A WONDERFUL PLOT AND ANIMATION AND VOICE ACTING!! 11/10
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,I really liked this movie death is amazing gave me chills so far great movie I would 100% recommend I will probably rewatch it again and again and again
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"I expected nothing from this movie going in, and it knocked every single moment out of the park. The animation is gorgeous, the characters extremely well written, the music pitch perfect, the story was gripping. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time. I have never rated anything on rotten tomatoes before, but I wanted to just for this movie. I enjoyed it that much.

If you're still on the fence about seeing it, just go for it. It will definitely surprise you."
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie had no ""dull moments"". It was funny, insightful and the storyline was easy to follow. I especially loved the back story. I almost screamed when  SPOILER ALERT they alluded to another Shrek movie"
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Mandy & aleena loved it. Maddy said she learned the power of friendship. Aleena said she learned death is unavoidable & not to fear it because than death will take you. But yeah they both enjoyed it
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,This was awesome 10/10 must watch
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,I cried through half the thing. Would watch it a dozen more times and drag all my friends with me to witness this masterpiece on the big screen. Best movie I've ever watched by far.
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked it ,well the part that I watched which was the beginning of the movie but had to leave because my friend got a racing heart and had to leave the theatre to get medical treatment."
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great animation, great story telling with fairy tale characters."
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything was great. Music and songs were great too.
"Jan 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I don't know what audience this is for? It was way too violent and scary 75% of the time for my daughter. If this is for an older audience, why make the protagonist a cat? Too many questions that I don't care to think about. Moving on."
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"As cenas de ação são perfeitas, a evolução que a DreamWorks teve, foi incrível. Personagens maravilhosos e cativantes, amei cada segundo desse filme. A história é contagiante e não te faz perder o interesse."
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Corre corre gatito!!
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was so much fun, lots of unexpected twists and turns, and yet touching at the same time.  Definitely worth watching!  Looking forward to the sequel..."
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic. Love it so much.
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Great for kids has funny moments and I love that there was a little Spanish incorporated!!
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the legend. Great story and characters.
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,one if not the best animated film I have ever seen
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,My husband & I enjoyed the movie. We thought it was very good! A little dark & scary in some parts for little ones but we thoroughly enjoyed it. It has puns that older kids & adults will get. Plus it helps to be a cat lover!
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"amazing animation, epic movie , great history "
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Great not for kids under 13 though! Has some words but are bleeped out!
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Puts Avatar: The Way of Blueface and their ignorant watchers to great shame
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Very well done story telling. The animation was great.
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Baita filme, engraçado, emocionante e revirado de reviravoltas!"
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Love it. A MUST SEE MOVIE. 
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a year for animation it has been and this one is one of my favorites of the year! The animation itself is absolutely stunning, probaly my favorite looking animation of the year! The voice cast is doing a great job, with Antonio Banderas stealing the show as in the last movie. The wolf is one of the best animation villians in a while, the whistle was just so good and the animation style on him incredible. Puss in Boots the Last Wish is of course a bit predictable, especially the ending, however i would be lying of if I didnt say i got kinda emotional. Overall the movie is just a stunning achievement, with a huge step-up from the last movie!"
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Without a shadow of a doubt. One of the best animations to date. The best of the YEAR!
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"I saw this movie with my friend, and we had such a good time watching it! I'm also a cat person so it was just fun seeing a cat as the main character! Also the movie had such a fun story and the animation in the fight scenes was just so awesome! I loved the way this movie looked! I definitely recommend you watch this movie no matter what age you are, it's great for everyone!!"
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"literally one of the best movies i have seen in years. artistic, funny, empowering, and sweet. go see it."
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Best animated movie of 2022
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Took the kids to see this fully expecting myself to be counting down the minutes so we could leave. I think I got more out of it than they did. 
  The story is the kind of thing we would have gotten back in the Don Bluth days-- you know, just dark enough to know you're not watching a Disney movie but not too dark for kids.
  All the characters were great and the message of appreciating the time we are given was delivered in a way that was not corny or schmaltzy."
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"amazing film, from start to finish"
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such a great movie for anyone to enjoy, the characters and the plot were great."
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"the film is fun and incredible, with well-developed and charismatic characters one of the best animation films of this year!"
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"I cant even put my thoughts into words, it would become a whole novel if i did, and i dont feel like writing a novel at 12am.
But to sum it up, this movie is AMAZING. It was —is— so good, the characters are so well developed, the story is so well done, i LOVE the villains and the villains-but-not-villains
This movie actually brought me to tears (a very rare occurrence), i felt genuine fear when i saw the wolf lurking around — following puss — and the dark humour was just MWA
And to top it all off the animation was just so pleasing to look at

I'd recommend this movie to pretty much everyone. It hits in all the right places and i know i've repeated this a lot but it really is just amazing!"
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme muito bom gostei bastante, principalmente do lobo ficou foda até me arrepiou kkkkjjkkkk"
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,I'd say this absolut masterpiece deserves the title Movie of the Year.
"Jan 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Meaningful Story, cute animation."
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,So glad I purchased it instead of renting through a streaming service. I will be rewatching throughout 2023. Did not expect it to be such a great movie. Watch it! You won't regret it.
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"An awe amazing movie, go spend your money people well worth the cash!"
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Now that I've seen Puss in Boots 2 I must say...
Number 1: THAT WAS AMAZING LOOK AT THAT BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF ART, WHAT A STORY, THE MUSIC, PERFECT ALL OF IT ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.
Number 3: Have a good day."
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Great storyline with an amazing villain. The ending could have been better but overall WOW
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"A melhor animação do ano, o único filme que assisti duas vezes no mesmo dia Dream Works está de parabéns"
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie does justice to piss and boot fans. It is better then the book. Nice to see on the big screen.
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie for the family with adult jokes snuck in. I would definitely recommend this animated movie to everyone!
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good animation, but not surprising, I liked the action scenes that were well planned, I hope for more films like this."
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme consegue fazer valer a pena a espera de 12 anos pela continuação do filme solo do gato de botas, o ""vilão"" principal está simplesmente excepcional, consegue passar medo e tensão quando aparece e mudou o patamar de antagonistas da DreamWorks, um dos melhores - se não o melhor - filmes de animação que vi nos últimos anos sem dúvidas."
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Very hilarious and the action was great.
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Just the animation alone is beautiful and the movie was just perfect in every way imaginable
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Esse é o melhor filme da franquia de gato de botas e da saga de Shrek
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Cute story. No bad language! Great for the family to see.
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a cute movie that was engaging for both adults & kids! We loved it ! Great storyline.
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Just FUNNY and Very good villans
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Great  a beautiful family movie!!!
"Jan 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kids will like it more.
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's just good, that's it"
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Peak in boots                                    d
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"While the movie wasn't perfect, it was fun and the visuals looked amazing.
absolutely worth watching."
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,I would leave a 13 out of 1O but that would break the scale ! Lol but man this movie was awesome.
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Una película excepcional, el nuevo diseño gráfico es muy eficaz, la buena historia y guion hacen que la trama se sienta fluida y se te pase rápido aún habiendo visto la cinta más de una vez. Todos los personajes mantienen una química enorme y una personalidad bien definida, se ve como todo encaja a la perfección y acabas teniendo una gran película animada, apta para todos los públicos. La historia va mucho más allá de hacer un par de bromas, tiene mensajes que hablan sobre temas y valores muy maduros como por ejemplo: el miedo a la muerte, el saber valorar lo que tienes en tu vida, disfrutar de tu vida de manera feliz y despreocupada, etc. Cabe destacar los distintos tonos que se muestran a lo largo de la historia, y aún así lo bien que se expresan las emociones de los personajes en todo momento, sobre todo las del protagonista, haciendo que la audiencia entienda que es lo que está pensando y sintiendo con tan solo una mirada. Además la cinta cuenta con una banda sonora muy pegadiza y activa, que te hará bailar al más puro estilo de ""la leyenda"", El gato con Botas. En resumen, una película maravillosa muy acertada en todos los aspectos cinematográficos, para mí la mejor que he visto en mucho tiempo."
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time. It's a movie with so much heart and soul that no matter the age, anyone can enjoy. Never would I have thought that a Puss in Boots movie would be such an emotional tale about one's mortality. Overall, it's an extremely fun, funny, and emotional movie. If you haven't seen it in theaters go and do that, this movie deserves to be appreciated and earn money. It's an excellent movie, and without a doubt, one of my top 5 of all time movies, and easily in my top 3 movie of 2022, and here's a hint, it's not third nor second place."
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good plot line and actual good story telling. It makes you think about your own choices in life with a good message about appreciating what you have
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,One of my top 10 favorite movies!
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Overall an easy 10/10 brings out every single emotion into play.
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,10/10 villain and heroes I loved everything about it!
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Fimeeee incrível melhor animação em muito tempo Pqpq que vilão já quero um gato de botas 3 é um minissérie sobre lá muerte
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a cute family movie!
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,so funny and the animation is insane 5/55555
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Conseguiu superar o primeiro. Maravilhoso e perfeito. Esperando a continuacao....
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Be forewarned, lots of violence, talks if murdering and not caring about people dying that could be saved, and characters from kids stories and nursery rhyme acting evilly. Some turn a new leaf, some dont. There are comments about how some of it is wrong.
   NOT a movie for the younger kids. Middle s schoolers can probably handle it, if you dont care about the above. 
   But the audience members seeming to enjoy it the most were the 20s-30s. I heard some of them say it was their second time, and they wanted to see it on the big screen again. I went with a couple of others- 56 & 65
     I really enjoyed the allusions to other stories and movies. (For example, Pinnochio, The theme from the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.). It was clever, animation of Puss looked like he was 3-D. I hate chihuahuas, but I learned to like what Id thought would be an annoying character.  Loved the effects and the concept of the map variations.
    Go see it. Its fun."
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was very good it had good actors.
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie he had no business being this peak lmao. the villain was the best animated villain probably ever in dreamworks and disney. Anime like choreographed fights. Really funny and great story. keep it up dreamworks.
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely loved it! Similar to Shrek in constant humor and entertainment!
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Really nice movie family oriented
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Existentialism at its finest. And a great use of the fairy tale to discuss an anxiety all can relate to. How should we love our lives? As this movie showed us (and extremely corny but right) through Team Friendship!
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic animation, emotionally moving plot, and sick af beats"
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, I personally didn't know this came out, was not particularly interested in it. But seeing all the amazing reviews and what the people were saying about it got me quite exited. Decided to give it and go and I am extremely happy I did. This movie has everything, stunning visuals, awesome character arcs and personalities and very emotion filled. 

I am someone who doesn't feel huge emotions watching movies generally, but The introduction of the Wolf gave me absolute chill. There is plenty of big emotional moments in this movie. Truly one of the best animated movie I have seen in the last year's."
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"the hour and a half felt like 30 minutes, the movie was awesome.
Death was an amazing character that provided an extreme sense of chaos and intimidation. The transition from stop motion to fluid animation was awesome as well, good ass movie all in all"
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Um das melhores melhores animações que eu já vi. Ótima sequência e um dos melhores filmes da DreamWorks nos últimos anos. 10/10
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,I was pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable this movie was. The villain was great. The characters were great and the animation was perfect. Will watch again!
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best animated movies I've ever seen
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,So good. Animation 10/10 Char 10/10 villains 10/10 story 10/10 progression 10/10
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent movie!! In love ❤️
"Jan 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,Love the moral of the story line and how we should value life and friendship and family. But hated my seats didn't recline. Yes the seats at the theater had a bad two seat that didn't recline
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really awesome movie. I loved the visuals and how they played with the framerate. The storyline was very Dreamwork-esque which was very predictable but also understandable. It had some very funny moments, as well as surprisingly bone-chilling moments scattered around. Overall, solid movie."
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Impressive, way better than the previous one. Animated in the ""bad guys"" style. Action packed, funny, heart warming. The Wolf character is daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam! a must see."
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the story ,the characters and A perfect movie for kids and adults"
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"The best animated movie to have come out in 2022. The last movie I had thought was fine, around a 2.5/5, but this movie absolutely blew me away. My biggest complaint was that it wasn't long enough, as it had so much going for it that I felt there were many things I wanted to be fleshed out more thoroughly. The visuals are amazing; think Into the Spiderverse combined with Shrek, but in a good way that makes it feel grounded and realistic but still with color and style that pop out like a comic book cover, yet for the whole movie. The plot was also very engaging; I felt interested the whole time. And the biggest thing for me was how the movie felt comfortable having more mature concepts in a kids movie, which I remember when  I was 7-10 years old I loved seeing in movies, and a young relative who also watched it agreed with me on that too. It wasn't completely flawless, but truly the pinnacle of what kids movies can be."
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie made me feel warm and fuzzy.
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Great theme! Nice sound
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Joder esto es cine...
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fantastic return to form for Dreamworks, especially after how amazing they did with The Bad Guys earlier last year, taking a beautiful Spiderverse-esque stylized approach to animation that provides a breath of fresh air to a series that I personally felt looked somewhat dull as it aged. Fight scenes were beautifully made, with amazing comedy for all ages. Overall, just a fantastic movie for everyone"
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Cute and hilarious.
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved everything about the movie! The story, the concept, the characters, animation, nostalgia everything was top tier and I dont even do reviews"
"Jan 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was a good storyline with a good ending but the animation has changed to half how it used to be and half like it's in a classic comic book or an anime, i do not like the change Noor do I think that the mix between works."
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Bom filme! Assisti o primeiro filme no cinema, sempre assistismos aqui em casa, tinhamos DVDs do filme, assistimos todas as saguas de Sherk em casa apenas para rever a lenda do Gato de Botas, aqui em casa assistimos o filme semana passada, nos cinemas, foi mágico rever nosso tão querido personagem nas telinas!! Filme incrivel, qualidade ótima tudo está extremamente agradável."
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Eu gostei bastante do filme, quando eu vi que a animação tinha mudado eu fiquei com um pé atrás. mas quando fui ver no cinema foi uma experiência top. Vilão ótimo, animação e visual incríveis"
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Stunning visuals, fluid and exciting action and surprisingly mature themes. Easy 5/5"
"Jan 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's terrible. People around me were laughing, at what? It's so unfunny it hurts."
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible and surprising!
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible graphics that keeps you engaged with every action scene, hilarious characters and vibrant landscapes. Truly enjoyed!"
"Jan 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"O filme é bonito em gráficos e animação e tem uma história chamativa e divertida, mas também fácil de enjoar, mas é um bom filme."

The Wishing star is a symbol of the ""fantasy"" that occupies a place in everyone's heart. Because life is not perfect, we fantasize about immortality, we fantasize about never being apart, we fantasize about never being defeated. Many of us spend our lives in vain for this fantasy, but we don't stop to look around us. What is the beauty and truth that is neglected?

Death, loss and failure are all things that we have to go through in our life. This story about the omnipotence of Wishing star and the non-existence of Wishing star tells us that nothing can help us avoid all these things. We can only accept, face and adapt to them with the spirit of our heart. The beauty of fantasy may not be so good, but the real beauty may be in the present, perhaps it is not too late, waiting for your discovery and embrace; Abandoned heart, insatiable, will come back to bite you."
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is absolutely phenomenal. A masterpiece in animation, storytelling, and characters. You don't need to have watched Shrek or the first Puss in Boots or anything. Just trust me and watch this movie. It is truly something special."
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Um filme engraçado,profundo e com um suspense muito bem dividido. 
Personagens com histórias bem feitas ."
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Coldest animation movie
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,extremely imaginative
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Um filme simplesmente impecável, tem um roteiro simples que faz bem à toda família e carrega uma mensagem grandiosa. Agrada aos olhos com a sua animação e me faz sair do cinema cheio de alegria, por um ano com mais grandes obras assim"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really interesting characters, intertwined previous movies without seeming repetitive but the storyline stands on its own."
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"At first, I wasn't expecting nothing from this movie. And so I was punched right into the face by this masterpiece with an absolutely great animation, script, scenarios, camera angles, funny characters, action moments AND A MASTERPIECE VILLAIN. Man, this movie has one of the badass animation villains of all time. It has gave me goosebumps every single time the villain appeared in to the scene. 
This was one of the best movies I have watched in years, I recommend you to go and watch this with your family and kids RIGHT NOW! Trust me, I won't disappoint you."
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Isso Que E Um Filme De Animação 💪
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,It's surprisingly better than the first in terms of both story and animation. 11 year sim the making makes it better than it had any right to be.
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining.   Creative humor,  the throwbacks to the nursery rhyme characters now being grown up are hilarious.  I took my 3 granddaughters and they enjoyed it very much. Ages 4, 6 and 9.  A good lesson is learned in the end also.  Will watch again when it comes out on tv."
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,one word: masterpeace
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely incredible, from the very beginning I was immediately immersed. The song featured in it is amazing and there isn't a single dull moment. Best movie I've ever seen!!"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie for all ages. Lobo was so dark and creepy love it.
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Goodness this movie is SO much fun to watch. Al the characters are enjoyable to watch on screen and the plot is super interesting; along with the moral that is paired with it. And the animation style + art style…OH MY WORD ITS SO GOOD!!!! It's like eye candy I love it haha
Anyways, HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this movie. It deserves all the love in the world"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"it's a good movie and storyline, humorous for all ages."
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Esse filme é incrível, o final... nossa, eu arrepiei ate os ossos. Uns dos melhores filmes de 2023, certeza"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's very good, there's a lot to learn in this children's movie."
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved loved loved, 10/10. I cried watching it"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,This is hands down one of the greatest movies i've ever seen in my life. I haven't gotten anything done in school today because I can't stop thinking about this absolute masterpiece. This movie tells a beautiful story from start to end. I personally have never related to anything more than I have this movie.
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Quite fun and entertaining
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing story and art style.
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,the villan in this movie was a top tier dreamworks villan and they did a great job with the plot and voice actors
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely wonderful experience! Stunning animation, great music and a lovely story. This is a must see!"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, very emotional as well, don't think an animated movie has got me that emotional since UP. Animation style is a bit different, but suits the story well and you don't notice it after a few minutes."
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is really fun and has great themes. This movie is pretty funny and juggles 3 villains better than spider-man 3, and is probably in the top 10 for dream work's best films. It never puts one character on hold for another, and follows many themes without one being half-baked. The big bad death is a terrifying villain and is probably on of the best villains of this year (2022). This movie better get an Oscar for best animation I swear to god"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,loved everything about it. cute happy positive dog. pus and kitty. DEATH. jack. everything
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing visual and meaningful message. Absolutely worth the time
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Handles themes of mortality, trust, and family extremely well and delivers an extremely well crafted antagonist in the Big Bad Wolf. A must see family feature!"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's really good, the villain was fantastic, but this animation style is absolutely terrible. I
 feel it's meant to be a cross between 3D animation and old fashioned drawn animation. But it just looks like lower quality to me"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love the animation and the history. I feel this movie is beautiful, it's has a lovely message for the audience, so funny and real at the same time. Furthermore, the animation has a different style from Disney movies, I was so tired of realism in animated movies, because they are not real, and this movie make me feel like I was watching a comic or something different. It was amazing."
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filled with emotion and passion, Puss in Boots returns with a question that everyone should ask themselves, what would you do with one wish? 11 years of waiting was definitely worth the wait. With a new art style and story, Puss in boots brings back the care free emotions we all once felt. Showing us that sometimes what we wish to have, could be right in front of us the entire time."
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,literal masterpiece. this movie felt like a glass of water after running in the dessert for 3 days after watching avatar 2. the scenario the dialogue the characters everything was perfect in the movie I LOVE DEATH SO MUCH I'm losing my shit fr
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly a mostly perfect film to watch and see.  I know this sounds cliché, but this movie is a must watch."
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,This film is just so good. The magnum opus of Dreamwork.
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! Bring new life to this franchise 

was not expecting much story at first and just thought it would be just another looks really good movies and turn brain off to enjoy...
but i was so wrong
AMAZING STORY
AMAZING VISUALS
AMAZING CHARACTERS"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Story line was very detailed which made it entertaining for both adults and children.  I did feel it was a bit long for the younger set.
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was just rigth, everything feels okay, and it's a great second part"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,The fear of death is a genuine feeling that they really formed the movie around and it came out perfect
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Way better than avatar
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"My best cartoon of the year .The music , animation and development character is so well . A big compliments for dream work 
The dead is scary but he so cool
One of the best villain ever"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,great 10/10 wow awesome
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing, The the drawings was absolutely beautiful"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"An absolutely amazing film that's one of if not the best animated movies to come out in the past several decades. The Last Wish takes the surprising oppurtunity to tackle the struggles of life and death, managing to depict and do both justice with the tact they deserve while bringing us along for a ride that's entertaining and relatable to all ages. And along for the showing are some of the best villains I've seen make a debut in a kid's show in decades, managing to encompass several antagonists that are truly evil, either misguided, or forces of nature without any feeling left out or underdeveloped. 

The Last Wish was clearly made by people who cared and a team of writers who wanted to do Puss justice, and they succeed in making an absolute must watch movie. You could even go so far as to easily make the arguement that it surpasses the Shrek movies which spawned it."
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Going into this movie I thought it was going to be a quick cash grab but it feels like such a passion project. The animation is beautiful, the storyline is fantastic, the character design is gorgeous and overall it's hilarious. I think it's my new favorite of all time and I recommend everyone at least gives it a chance."
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,ITS A BEATIFUL MOVIE FOR THE LAST'S PUSS IN BOOTS MOVIE.
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually amazing, great storyline and subplot. Best villain I've seen for a long long time. Had everything you could want in a film; funny, cute, family friendly, horror, pulled on the heartstrings and music. 10/10 will probably watch again and again, top 3 films of all time for me."
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great visuals, and a fun story that ends with an exciting setup for sequels and further spin-offs. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was not expecting much from this movie but what I got was something amazing. The animation was well done and story was also well executed. I can not praise it enough, if dreamworks makes more of these kinds of movies I will be in that theatre every for every single movie they make!!!!"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think the best movies are those in which you enter absolutely miserable and come out feeling energized and laughing, joyful while reminiscing the movie with yourself or whoever you came with. This movie really accomplished that for me"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,DAWG GO SEE IT RIGHT TF NOW
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing! Everything you want is there ! Phenomenal!!
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Genuinely a work of art. I cannot stop raving about this movie, if you have the chance to see it in theaters PLEASE DO"
"Jan 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'm over so much violence in kids movies. It's scary for kids and it's not enjoyable or clever. I don't want to hear about big Jack Horner wanting to shoot a puppy in the face. Death's constant whistle was horror movie creepy, a lot of kids were leaving the cinema to take a break from the intense scenes.  Shrek was great because it was funny and light hearted and the violence was less intense and more comedic. This was too much. I think using so much violence is pretty storyline wise."
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was amazing!!!!! I watched it in theaters and seeing it on a big screen made it much better. The animation style, the humor, the voice acting, AMAZING!!! I completely recommend it, and if you can, watch it in theaters!!"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"death is the best villain of 2022 and i won't give up that fact until i forget about it
no like seriously death is a golden villain"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This has to be the best animated movies of 2022, possibly one of the best dreamworks film."
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly, a solid watch! Kept me watching the whole time even if it was at 03:30am!!! Defo worth a watch! Some great hidden references in there too if your a shrek fan, will 100% watch again"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"The word ""Masterpiece"" is not thrown lightly on this movie. Every scene is energetic and has a purpose on the story, that's surprisingly dark and rich and *actually* respects the viewers' maturity. Everything else follows on the same masterfully crafted movie. It's not a perfect movie, but it's really close to one in everything that it does."
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,The best movie I have ever watched
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,movie was so absolutely good that i cant put it into words. Every joke landed and the movie looked great with an amazing story. best animated movie since shrek 2.
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"No joke, truly a great funny movie. Enjoyed every second. Would love to watch it many times!"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Funny and moving, fun for all ages"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best family movies in a very long time in my opinion.  You will not be disappointed in the clever charm puss brings.
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought this movie was flawless. Every aspect down to the storyline, cinematography, and animation. The entirely of this movie excesses any expectation I had. I thank the whole Puss in Boots team for their outstanding efforts of creating the sequel to the late 2011 original. Notability, I think found the best villain in an animation picture, ever. The definition of a perfectly paced story with perfect main characters to accompany it. The plot was something I have never seen before. The nostalgia, suspense and interest that I felt was completing. I hope to see more of the story in a potential third movie."
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely Fantastic
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,holy moly how is it that good ???
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie went so hard!! The villain was terrifying and Puss' growth through this film was great! Plus Florence Pugh. Overall 10/10
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Masterpiece in animation and story.
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it from beginning to end. Laughed a lot as the action weaved itself through this awesome movie. Great tease for a future Shrek movie.
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie I love it
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely one of the best movies of this year,
Amazing, character development and storytelling
Death was definitely one of my favorite characters"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed from beginning to end. The animation was incredible, character design was amazing, couldn't believe how much I enjoyed it. Was just going because I had seen almost everything else, Puss in boots blew my socks off."
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,This film is the best animated film in a very while.
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"excellent movie 100% recommended for the whole family with a nice message, congratulations!!! ❤️"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was outstanding. The animation was insane, especially the fight scenes, it reminded me of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (another great movie by the way). By far the best-animated movie of 2022. That storyline was really good too, I didn't expect a movie about a cat wearing boots to be that good. Dreamworks did a great job as usual. I'd like to mention the villain (Jack Horner), INSANE! I loved this character so much. There are also lots of references from other movies, which is great, I would definitely recommend this movie. Masterpiece!"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"6yr old loved it! However, there are a few scenes where the characters say things that may or may not surprise you regarding age appropriate language."
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"excellent film well made well thought out, superior to any Disney"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good CGI, almost too fast to follow.  Excellent supporting music."

There's a profound message in it about aging. Just awesome."
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie, better than the first one"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful movie in all, The original film came out in 2011, the plot and character matured like fine wine and in result really connected to the original audience which have also matured in age. This sequel is one of the few that has surpassed its predecessor with a mixture of emotions it will make you laugh, sad, worried, etc…"
"Jan 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,Did not like the story line.   Fell asleep and left half way through.
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Best animated movie of the year
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Had me crying a couple times, beautifully animated, and pretty good story I loved it"
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely amazing. Best movie to start the new year!
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"the movie was fantastic, animation was spectacular. DreamWorks has really upped their game with their last to projects. The writing and animation in Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, as well as Bad Guys is so good. I hope to see more original and innovative things from this company. I'm getting sick of sequels."
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful movie, cried a lot"
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a great movie, who watches will certainly have a good time. The characters were great, the protagonist can extract good laughs from who is watching, as just as he with the other mains characters in the movie. Overall, an excellent time."
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Though it may look like the typical sequel to a sequel it isn't. This movie truly has some emotional moments where we get to see Puss and his struggles of being a legendary hero.
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie, brought me back to my childhood and made me nostalgic about the Shrek franchise. While yes, the plot is somewhat lacking and predictable. I still felt satisfied and entertained. I recommend it to anyone just looking for something to watch that is simple, fun, and entertaining."
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Straight up perfect! Primarily because of the animation, it's so sick! Then the storytelling, how they manage to get a lot of fairytales in one place. And finally character development - I love it"
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fantastic and beautiful animation, script better than many ""cinema giants"". I hope the post credit scene really happens and that this universe expands more. I love this is adventure!"
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good sequel, would recommend to anyone."
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"One thing I didn't expect this year was for the sequel to Puss In Boots to be this good. The animation is smooth and stellar, the villain is absolutely chilling and had my eyes widening every time he appeared on screen, the other villains work well, the humor is surprisingly quite good, the message it portrays is amazing. When I walked out of the cinema I just felt... happy. I felt happy that this movie was as good if not better than what everybody was saying about it. Go watch this if you haven't already"
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you've watched Shrek, you'll find this new movie endearing. Very heavy topics addressed in a fun manner, characters that make you fall in love with them, and amazing designs. Loved."

"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movie.. We enjoyed it
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie has been living in my mind rent free ever since I first saw it. Seriously the writers and producers had no reason to go this hard on this movie. Everything from the animation, characters, and underlying themes are a cinematic masterpiece. Death is easily one of the greatest villains that has ever come out of dream works. I can not stress this enough, GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!"
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is an incredible movie, the animation is phenomenal the low frame rates are often times reserved for action scenes and look amazing, the artstyle is beautifull the brush astetchic is also beautifull and the combination of colors just pop and give this sub franchise it's own feel. All the characters are great and are some of their arcs, from puss learning that death is inevitable and that he's not immortal, softpaw learning to trust again etc. And the Antagonists! Oh are they great aswell! I can't put into words how great this movie is, just watch it if you haven't just do it, it's worth it"
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is amazing for both kids and adults and the animation is incredible
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Charming, funny, and full of heart Puss in boots delivers a dark and haunting tale of family and what we wish we could have. The frame rate moves seamlessly from animation style to the next bringing a beautiful stylistic film to life. It's a great film for kids and adults."
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Malgré la sortie d'Avatar 2 attendu depuis longtemps, le Chat Potté 2 se défend brillamment. Le film est efficace, bourré de références comme de sens, drôle et émouvant. A aucun moment l'ennui s'installe chez les spectateurs, ces derniers sont captivés et réactifs du début à la fin. L'animation est double, deux styles différents s'imposent tous deux très agréables. Bref, ne marchez pas, courrez au cinéma pour le voir !"
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"The animation amazing
Story plot everything was just to good"
"Jan 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,The story was great and it had its funny moments .

"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots is the greatest movie I've watched this year, all of the characters are captivating and there are no deadweights. The messages are also presented in a very mature way and makes the experience much more enjoyable alongside the mindnumbingly beautiful art style. 9.5/10"

"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wasn't expecting much but it was great, the antagonist was very good able to be threatening without any backstory"
"Jan 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was cute and had some good life lesson messages.  My 10 yr old granddaughter fell asleep and 12 yr old grandson said he loved it.  I felt it was lacking something, just dont know what."
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie surprised me in how good it was, it had natural charecter development, a decent plot, and one of the most compelling and genuinely intimidating antagonists I've ever seen in an animated movie."

"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"To try to escape the death is to live a life of denial and fear, but it's the relationships and adventures we embrace that makes living worthwhile."
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,It's Awesome I Love It!
"Jan 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kids said animation could be better but enjoyable

The villian actually made me shit my pants everytime he appeared. The visuals are really sexy and hot and just everything about it is amazing.
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfect villain and perfect teachings
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,We really enjoyed the humor of the movie and the message as well. It is more a young teen-adult movie. Fun for the family but for people who worry about cussing it does have mild language in it.y boyfriend and I loved and enjoyed it and werent bothered by it at all but we know people can sometimes be more sensitive to it.
"Jan 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,I am disappointed by the use of bleeps and bad language in the movie.  It wasn't necessary and could have been avoided.
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie! The moral of the story was good.

"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best animated films I've seen. Finally a movie with a great storyline that's not pushing political ideas or agendas. Non stop family fun for both kids and adults!
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was pretty good, had a really good message for kids and was entertaining. Some of the animated action was similar to Into the Spiderverse.
All the voice acting was spot in, I thought Florence Pugh as Goldilocks was great. There were a lot of kids in the theater and they were all laughing and having a good time. If you have kids, I would highly recommend taking them."
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved everything about the movie just wished it was 3d
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, amazing animation"
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Every second my wife and I were HOOKED! Was an amazing experience and we will definitely buy it!! Worth seeing twice!

"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,I was so fixated watching this movie it felt like I was a kid again. I almost cried at the end I hope they have a happily ever after ☺️
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very cool, The cat had sexy voice, cute dog, watch"
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a superb achievement in animation, supported by a strong voice cast, an emotional story, and clever comedy as only Dreamworks can provide. This is a perfect animated film."
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie! Lots of action and adventure.  Would not recommend for small children in theater because the wolf would be a little too scary.
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was amazing, the characters were well written and it was a great way to conclude the series."
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun for the whole family - we loved it!

"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie.  Very cute And interesting.
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,It was entertaining!!!
"Jan 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,Thumbs down! We had to leave because who wants to see nothing but bad news and bleak scary situations one after another. None of the characters were likable.
"Jan 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,It did not hold my 6 year old grandchilds attention.
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Unexpectedly excellent! Highly recommended from my brother and I!!
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,amazing!! a lot laughing!😀👍🏼
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing animation and voice acting
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was great except for a few cuss words . We had small children watching
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie had beautiful animation and a perfect script with a plot that was completely it's own. It's impressive how DreamWorks brought in the nostalgia of Shrek, and fairytale feelings, along with this new sense of deeper meaning and life lessons. Even a childless adult (like myself and my spouse) can enjoy this masterpiece."
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,My only complaint would be that my 4 kids ages 3-10 years old all said the wolf was a little too scary other than that we loved it!
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie. Nice story line and very funny.
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,It was very good movie
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Its a wonderful movie for everybody- my 10 and 13 year old kids loved it!

"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome storyline! 
Super funny."
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,We loved the scary wolf.
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow, what a amazing movie"
"Jan 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not for kids.   Although there was no real gore, there was constant violence.  Dark.  While the swearing did not bother me much, it was totally not necessary.  The story line itself is good... The quest for the star...  But because the story and characters was constantly flipping back and forth in reference to old fairy tails and fairy tail characters, it was complex to follow especially for anyone who may not even be too familiar with some of the old time fairy tails.   Like other reviewers (and I could only relate to this after seeing the show) , the red eyed wolf grim reaper could leave kids with nightmares.   
Best over all description for this movie is 'weird'   it was a Missed opportunity.    I cant call it a bad movie..  But it is definitely weird based on the things above and I would not take my kids to see it.  We only went to see it due to lack of other better movie choices available"
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movie. My family and I loved it! Great service as well.
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Took the kids. We all loved it. Good plot and story line. Love how if all intertwined with the other story characters.
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"(english not first language) Its a example of how to do fairy tals movie's.
This movie have a lot of references to many fairy tales, has a moral and good animation's. This is a movie you want to show your kids. As an 19 years old, i find this hitting me hard, as it have many references to our world now, with many jokes that only adults will understand, but are harmless to kid's, the way the characters are made are amaizing, every character have depth and is build creativly, quality of this animation's are great, and i cant hold myself from watching it again, after a first watch i cant say i anything bad about this movie. It's must see"
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such a fun, well animated movie that stood it's ground without really even needing to watch his Netflix show or prior movie. such an excellent antagonist and the light hearted moments are really sweet and enjoyable. The movie gave Puss so much depth and perfectly balanced the comedy and the serious parts. Honestly, it was such a great watch."
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's almost ridiculous how good of a movie this is, especially after the first Puss in Boots movie was largely forgettable. The animation is great, with the action and art style taking on an aesthetic reminiscent of Spider-man: Into the Spiderverse at times. Said animation might look a bit choppy at times, but it helps to sell the over-the-top nature of some really impressive action pieces.
Aside from that, the story's pretty good and surprisingly emotional at times, and even contains some intense moments that could almost pass for light horror (no surprise that these tend to happen when the wolf character see in the trailers appears). Without giving anything away, the story also has a good message about life itself that's a good takeaway from the whole movie.  There's still plenty of funny moments, but don't go in expecting it to be a full-on comedy like the past Shrek movies and spin-offs.

All in all, I had a great time with this, and I also recommend seeing this on the big screen if you can. Hopefully this is the start of a good upswing in Dreamworks' animated library."
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a funny spiritual movie. this is a teaching lesson if you really look at it. great movie.😁
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Kids Loved the movie very funny
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Such an incredible movie with beautiful animation gosh i love this movie so much
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Last Wish was entertaining. The story was really good and funny. Very colourful and with a lot of imagination. They used the animation techniques from Spider-verse in the action sequence, and it brought a lot of dynamics and style into them. The voice acting were very strong. My only problem were with the Spanish parts that didn't seem translated, but they are not numerous. The music was great. I give it 85%. A movie for all family, even if you get some more adult jokes, you also get some parts for the younger audience. Nicely done and fun."
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked big bad wolf.  Liked when Puss N Boots got his courage back at the end of the movie and defended his honor.
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"I personally love this film because as a kid, Puss in Boots was and still is one of my favorite characters in the animated world. Honestly, this film is a must see for Puss in Boots fans. And it shows a great message to the audience!"
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Never have i enjoyed a movie as this one
"Jan 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"definitely a worthy entry.  i was afraid it might be just a hollow, soulless money grab.  but it was actually really good."
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"The goldielocks subplot made me tear up, the animation was stunnig, great charachters and great story"
"Jan 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,too much violence for a childrens movie
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good movie. Better than I expected.
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,The best movie of 2022 !
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked the movie bringing a very cool new theme that for 11 years I wondered if there would be another movie and there was and in my opinion in history and details it does better than the first one the only thing I found a little weird is what cats usually say which has 7 lives, not 9 but it did not affect the story, in fact, it is very well detailed, it brings that like from shrek, which is the franchise that we love so much, mainly with the post-credits and the villain, not even mentioned in the first one, he is a villain, then he becomes a hero in the second there are 3 villains, curly, the wolf and joaosao trumpet very good, I hope they continue like this"
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,It was ok.  That’s all I can say.  Would I see it again?  No.
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic- honestly one of my favorite movies, written really well and the characters are prefect. I love the way they portrayed death, and the fight scenes are amazing."
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,The action.  It was very fast moving and kept your attention.  Loved it
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun for kids! Watchable for adults. Can't go wrong with that.
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Great animation and nice story. I really enjoyed it. I only give 5 stars to most excellent films.
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing writing. It's rare to watch an animated film that actually has a story relatable to both adults and children, and Puss in Boots The Last Wish does just that. For starters, all the voice-overs were outstanding, and all of the characters had something to offer than just their presence in the story. The characters and the story itself had moments of joy, laughter and tears. The humor was particularly relatable and funny, again, for both adults and children. The pacing was spot on and the 102 minute runtime just flew by. This is one of the better animations I've seen in a while, and I love how the ending lead up to the next sequel to Shrek. A must watch for everyone."
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun, adventurous, hilarious, powerful meaning, epic, and most of all.

Absolutely no political correctness or woke values.

Amazing movie! Now in my list of top 10 favorite animated films."
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Dude this movie is so good please watch it immediately. This and spider verse are two of the best animated movies I have ever seen.
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Puss in boots > avatar
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie, but i still think the first one was better. I personally did not really see the need for the dog either in the story. Death was by far my favorite dreamworks movie villain though."
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Watched the Portuguese version (PT-PT). The movie is funny from the beginning until the end. Visually it is also amazing. Its a must watch, with or without kids."
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"No joke an absolutely incredible experience, as well as fresh and stunningly gorgeous. The animation style is very similar to ""Spider Man: Into the Spiderverse"", but is also significantly different enough to mean something else to the audience.

So many creative choices that span across the whole movie, and creative choices that stick to certain scenes, are incredibly well-done and lovable. The choice to personify death is one of my favorite villains of all-time; and he is so well done it legitimately brings me to tears. The scene where Puss in Boots is fleeing from the Cave of Lost Souls and is comforted by Perrito, the choice to legitimately make a heart-wrenching and emotion-packed scene is so awesome when I know that adding a tension-relieving joke would have been so easy. 

But it's not all serious, after-all it is a kid's movie. But to call it a kid's movie is a strawman- it is so, so much more. The jokes are well-done and the references to pop culture (""Not the bees!"") are both cringey and lovable; just how I like them. The wish plotline is a common trope, but is so well done in this movie through the incredible relationships between characters. Goldi and the Bears are a group that want the wish to have a family, but already have one. Kitty Soft-Paws wants the wish to trust someone, but through the journey she gains that naturally. Puss in Boots wants the wish to get more lives, and to make his glory-days last forever, but learns that this isn't what he truly wants. Jack Horner is a greedy doofus and genuinely has some great jokes, as well as serving alongside Death as a sort of ""Time-Keeper"". 

Incredible movie. The 10/10 rating is overdone but I legitimately think this movie was pulled off nigh-perfect, and is an incredible addition to the animated movies world."
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Phenomenal movie! Excellent and unique animation style with awesome use of frame rate changes during fight scenes. Forget if you didn't like the first one, Puss in Boots 2 is miles ahead in every aspect from its predecessor. Some scary scenes that may not be the best for under 8 year olds"
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,A true cinematic masterpiece
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"A must watch. This movie is filled with beautiful animation, belly laughing, and tear jerking moments. It had a mature story that adults can love while still keeping things lighthearted for children. I grew up with the Shrek films and I'm happy to see that DreamWorks hasn't lost their spark."
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"The animation style straight out of spiderman into the spiderverse are killing it! The story is great, considering its a sequel to puss in boots, which wasnt fantastic. The message of having one life, and appreciating it is great and the movie doesnt beat you with it. The plotline with Kitty having trust issues is actually very well done, many movies, like for example ""raya and the last dragon"" these days try to feed it to you through a tube while screaming at your face ""DO YOU GET THE MESSAGE?"". Death as a character is one of, if not the best and most scary villians from dreamworks movies. In the first scene with him i had litteral chills when they showed Puss bleeding, i was not expecting them to show something like this in a kids movie,The idea that litteral death is trying to kill you, is terrifying. I expected to hate the supporting dog character, but i didnt. Its nice to see a such a positive character interacting with all those sad and bitter (for the most part) characters. His backstory was so tragic, it almost made me cry T_T.  Easily one of the best movies by Dreamworks. 12/10 would watch again"
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing animation, great humor, loveable characters and an good story made it so I never wanted this movie to end."
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Great action and enough funny things to entertain my 9 year old
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss In Boots is easily the best entry in the Shrek franchise. From it's watercolor aesthetic to the emotional script, consistent wit, and incredible fight scenes, there is nothing short of perfection in just about every aspect of this movie."
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Love love it!!!!! Great movie! Super funny
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was such a perfectly made movie, the art style alone should be enough of a draw for anyone who appreciates animation. The characterisation is just so lovely and heart wrenching, the plot is thought provoking, and I can't put it into words how much I recommend this movie!!! I really did enjoy every second"
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'll get this out of the way first. This movie is fantastic. Plain and simple. It's great. It's creative, it's funny, it's touching, it's scary, it's mature, it's intelligent, it's entertaining for both kids AND adults, it's... A goddamn Puss in Boots The Last Wish. I think we can all agree that this is the last title anyone here can associate with top notch quality. I mean it's a sequel to a spin-off movie from over 10 years ago. A rather mediocre one at that. And yet this movie goes far and beyond ANY expectations and makes itself into probably THE best animated movie of 2022. But then again. This is coming from a studio that made Kung Fu Panda series be known as one of the finest animation series as well.

But let's get to the details. First being the animation. It's gorgeous. It's amazing how well this movie looks with it's Spiderverse like animation and further proves how chasing after realizm in animated movies is at this point a fool's errand that kind of misses the point of animated movies. But it's not just a rip-off Spiderverse in looks. Oh no. When that movie looked like a comic book that came to life, this one feels like a Illustrated Fairy Tale book. The paint brush aesthetic looks great, it's colorful and feels alive. It's animated in a fantastic way and I think it's best described in saying that the fight with the Giant from the trailers is NOT the best part of this movie. Oh no. It only gets better from there. 10/10 on visuals.

Now to the characters. I love pretty much all of them. Puss in Boots of course takes center stage here and his character is at it's best here in terms of depth and humor. He is cocky bastard at first, but as he loses his next to last life he quickly gets humbled and reminded of his now very apparent mortality and his character goes through great amount of growth. It's very nice to see his character evolve like it does in this movie. Another stand out I say is the Wolf who I can already tell will give several children nightmares (and that's good, you know a good fairy tale from the amount of scarred children it leaves in it's wake). People that made this DO NOT hold back with how scary they make this character. He is by far the best thing in the movie from his fights, the change in mood whenever he appears and the music that accompanies him. He is definitely one of the best villains I saw in an animated movie (but I could argue if it's okay to call him one, but that would mean getting into spoilers). Other characters such as Kitty Softpaws, Goldielocks, Three Bears, Jack Horner and Perrito are all VERY fun as well. Goldie and her family are a very sweet family that go through their own journey in this and could be said they are deutragonists of this movie, I really enjoyed them, their chemistry and their sweet development. Jack Horner though... I say this. He is by far the funniest part in this movie. He is a bastard, plain and simple and he is hilarious because of it and a certain character that is alongside him for a good chunk of the movie. As for Kitty, it's very nice to see her back and her story tied with Puss is very interesting and I like how they do not linger too long on her drama with Puss and resolve it in a more real way that doesn't derail the movie in any way. And then there is Perrito who many probably thought was going to be an annoyance, but he is by far the Heart of this movie and he is involved in probably the most touching scene in the movie. You will know when you see it. All in all characters another 10. It's incredible how there are so many of them and all of them are fun and likeable in their own way.

The story itself is very simple. It's a race to get the Last Wish from a fallen star. It's as Fairy Tale-ish as you can get. But the way it's executed, the way each character changes (well most of them at least) on this journey and how imaginative and creative the setups and environments are make it feel fresh and it really leaves an impact on you. Don't be fooled by the marketing. This movie deals with VERY heavy subjects such as death, mortality and appreciating one's life and acceptance of Death. It's a heavy movie in terms of themes, but it's so great to see that with it, it still is a very entertaining movie. With many clever jokes, great pacing, fantastic music (oh my God the music is GREAT in it as well. Heitor Pereira did a A+ job here) and colorful world and characters. It is a movie that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and that is something that is so good to see today. And this movie VERY well utilizes it's PG rating. Kids NEED Parental guidance in this movie, it is not a movie you put on to shut them up. You put it on because you want to show them something great, something they can have fun with, be scared of and learn from. And I think a lot of adults can sympathize with struggles characters face in this movie and laugh at the more adult jokes as well. Overall from story standpoint it's also 10/10. It's not a new story or message, but it is told in a way that makes it FEEL new and fresh and it tackles it in a mature way.

As for flaws... Ehhhh... Hard for me to find really. To me it's as perfect as animated flick can get. Again PUSS IN BOOTS THE LAST WISH. God is this a weird thing to say. Maybe there are some pacing issues with Goldie's story and her family conflict being resolved quickly during climax and one character is pretty damn 1-dimensional, but I would argue it's to add to the comedy and charm of said character since that one is not meant to be seen as anything more serious. It is not one the same level of greatness as Prince of Egypt obviously, but as far as Shrek movies go or most Dreamworks movies go... or hell, most animated movies go overall it's pretty damn close to the top to me. In Shrek franchise it's on the same level as Shrek 2 to me and it's a high, HIGH praise.

I have to say. I always preferred Dreamworks over Pixar. Yes, they do have FAR lower lows than the animation juggernaut, but to me they had higher highs with movies such as Prince of Egypt or Kung Fu Panda movies (and the fact that I can say Kung fu Panda series is one of the best pieces of animation is hilarious) and I found their good movies to be far more rewatchable than Pixar ones. But since then they kind of went down with quality sadly, but recently with The Bad Guys and now this movie I think it's safe to say that they are officially back and maybe better than ever. This movie I think proves how great movies from Dreamworks can be today and I think if they keep on going in this direction we may get more VERY special movies from this studio. And I wish them the best of luck on this road and for this movie to become greater and greater success, maybe even winning an Academy Award (as meaningless as that became as of late).

What can I say anymore it's about 9.5 to 10/10 to me. I love it. And I think many people will love it as well. Probably not to the same degree as me, but I think this will make your day and the new year that much better. It's worth your money, it's worth your time, it's worth your attention and by all means it's worth watching more than once."
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Childrens movie Loud"" at times, a dash of liberal agenda, but not ""WOKE"". Surprisingly fun. You won't hate it."
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,This film has phenomenal cinematography and beautiful stylized animation. The characters are very well written and the found family trope is a personal favorite of mine. This movie will give you chills and it oozes with personality and passion. Good job Dreamworks ^^
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,great movie!!! excellent
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme muito divertido com uma mensagem muito bacana. Fórmula simples para filmes de animação, é isso. Nada de lacração ou pauta woke, por isso vai agrada a todas as faixas de idade. Vai fazer uma ótima bilheteria."

"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolute must see and I think a surprise to us all. The movie has great animation with a new style and the storyline, characters and voice acting is great as well. DreamWorks really knocked it out of the park with this one. I only hope they can make another masterpiece like this."
"Jan 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,boring movie with an anticlimactic ending
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Great kids movie! Really well made! Great for kids and adults
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a surprise ! This was so good and better than the first puss in boots for sure, best villain I've seen in a dreamwork movie so far, best animated movie I've seen in 2022, not a single character felt annoying or out of place. I really recommend you to watch this movie, y there is something for everyone, kids and adults."
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"i realy enjoied this movie, it is very weird and funny"

"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"As with all animated films for kids, sometimes there is violence and there's always a chase scene. The bad guy versus the good guy. 
I guess action films are what keep the young ones alert and on their toes. 
I noticed a lot of kids in the audience laughing when they were bleeping out the curse words. 
This movie did have a good moral to the story. Happy endings are always welcome these days."
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entertaining. Though, the third act feels unfinished and the payoff slightly underwhelming with the Wolf…."
"Jan 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Idk- there wasn't any good humor, there was a lot of scary parts for my young kids and the mixed animation for the fight scenes felt disjointed and weird. 

I hated it."
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Hadn't even watched a preview and had low expectations going in.  Ended up being pleasantly surprised.  Funny and some emotional moments.  I think they will milk Puss until he's dry.  Pun intended.  Not that that's a bad thing.
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,loved it the character development and this movie show us the meaning of life itself maybe the one we wish for is already there you just have to open your heart
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining.  Went with granddaughter and found the movie surprisingly fun and exciting.
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing, the art style is clearly inspired by Spiderman in the Spiderverse but instead of doing a dumb copy paste, they made their own style and it works so well ! the story is also so well written and all the jokes landed perfectly. I loved the first movie as a child and I'm so glad they took the effort to do such a great movie instead of whatever the illumination studio releases these days"
"Jan 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was ok, the kids seemed to like it"
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,The art style was amazing with a couple Spider Man feel to it. My 11yo loved it. There were just enough funny adult jokes hidden in for me to stay engaged
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Its been a long time seen animated movie this much adventurous.
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually beautiful, heartfelt and funny. Came out of nowhere it feels like, and more people should see it!"
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"DreamsWorks made another masterpiece after years. The animation is sooo GOOD, the scenes felt so real, the fight scenes where the animation cuts to a 2d animation and gets some SICK framedrops. Pls guys do not crack it on the internet, it's worth the money. 9999/10"
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,A witty philosophical exploration of memento mori and the value of family.
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,The goldilocks fam is my fav!
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"very poggers, defo one of the best of 2022. or 2023? idk but it was good"
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"What an awesome movie! after 12 years the world-renowned legend himself, puss in boots is back and better than ever! a fairly short movie full of epic action, sadness, a LOT of cuteness, and DreamWorks' new animation style pleasing the eyes of the audience all around the world. It's great to see Dreamworks renewing movies of our long-loved nostalgic characters we all hope to look for more in the future! 😺⭐"

"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"I never thought this movie would be good cause of the first one but this movie is amazing from the quality to the animation the fight scenes were just beautiful but the reason why I am rating this a 4.5 instead of a 5 is from the ending I found it a bit corny with all the friendship stuff but yea its a kids movie, overall its a good movie and you should watch it"
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great life lesson in this movie. We have 1 life to live, not 9 and we need to get more out of life. Spend time with the ones you live and love others even if they are different from you."
"Jan 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a cute movie. Entertaining and a good way to pass some time. Some good life lessons in it as well.
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun even for the adults, plenty of adult references/jokes that the kids laughed at but the adults truly understood. Loved the characters!"
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,I chose to see this over Avitar and I have no regrets!
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Probably the best animated movie I’ve seen in recent memory, and one of the best films I’ve seen in the past year. Fantastic animation, all characters were expertly written, plot was A+ and voice acting was perfect. Left wishing this was a TV series."
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie!! As I overheard someone say “Everything that makes Shrek great x11”!

"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not what I expected yet, I was pleasantly surprised."
"Jan 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Shrek universe never gets old. For tale and movie lovers, Puss in boots is a funny adventure full of easter eggs and flashbacks."
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was extremely entertaining with very tight pacing, an amazing story, and eye-candy animation. It may be a bit dark for children under nine though so be careful."

"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,The humor was funny for both adults and children and one of the new characters is absolutely adorable!
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,I knew Dreamworks would deliver but wow. This was the first Puss in Boots movie I watched. So funny and so much heart. Absolutely LOVED every scene with The Wolf. Adults don't be afraid to turn this on even without the kids you won't be sorry.
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"DreamWorks did so much right in this movie that other movies fail to do. Expertly created villain, awesome character development, epic mood swings, all of it"
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic art direction. All of the set pieces and action scenes are dripping with style. Stands out in a different league than any other film on the Shrek universe. None of the others even compare. Fantastic action, humor and feel-good sentiment throughout. Everyone should give this one a watch."
"Jan 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,The story was cute. The animation was ok. My 7&9 year olds sat through the entire thing and were engaged. I was not.
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Adorable and good clean fun

"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Shrek related movie since Shrek 2
"Jan 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,Didnt like the cussing
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,i want that wolf to whistle into me
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Literally peak cinema. Greatest animated movie since Spider-Man Into the Spider Verse
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Je suis allé le voir avec mon gars de 5ans. Un peu trop de tension d'horreur pour lui, il a eu très peur. Je recommande de ne pas y aller avec les jeunes enfants. Cela dit, méchant bon film, les scènes de combats son bien rendu et intéressants, l'histoire n'est pas si cucul. Un bon fond, une belle idée esthétique de faire les scènes d'action un peu à l'animé japonais! Je le rate 5/5 mon gars 2/5 trop épeurant!"
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Would argue this is even better than the first one. Amazingly animated, great work from the entire cast, especially Banderaz, Hayek and Pugh. Everyone can learn a lesson from this movie. It was perfectly balanced between emotional heart felt moments and the humor we all know and love."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is a complex study of all phases of life and facing up to your own mortality.  The movie sort of glorifies murderousness so it was rough seeing little girls in fairy tale dresses watching the movie.  However for an adult or late teen, the movie is really enjoyable.  Other than the usual cast of characters, goldilocks kind of steals the show.  My nine year old enjoyed it but the content was not appropriate for her in my conservative opinion.  TV-14"
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's an awesome show. The animation, the sound design and the scenery is outstanding. The plot and the execution of the story is just to die for. Moving, sad, happy, frightening, overwhelming, and calming each in their own scene. So many emotions throughout one story, and none of them felt forced or out of place.

[SPOILER WARNING]
Some specifics I especially liked:
- Death. The metaphor of death and the disliking of multiple cat lives embodied as a fearsome wolf on the hunt is one of the best ideas this movie could've used. The character itself, when looked back on, is blatantly obvious, but the viewer might not even know what they are facing until it's clearly told. Their ambition and hunt-thrill build a compelling obstacle character who isn't straight up evil. Their motif isn't inherently to kill Puss, but to punish someone who hasn't valued their life while they were thrown so many chances to do so. I respect that.
- Perrito. I don't even know where to start. Our pup is so blatantly traumatized they don't even notice it. The support they provide to anyone who crosses their path is amazing, especially since they've had noone who wanted them up until the movie's story. They also represent a part of quite a lot of people's life, where they rely on therapy animals to go about their days and be able to overcome anxiety attacks, get general emotional support, or maybe even thoroughly aided help, which a companion can provide. The scene where Puss had a meltdown and Perrito laid on them felt real in atmosphere, just as in accuracy, as anxiety aid companions often apply pressure to help the body calm down. I love what Perrito stands for.
- The animation. It is dynamic, it isn't a constant, and that's what makes it so compelling and satisfying to look at. The framerate constantly changes, the simplified special effects give an entire different tone to a scene, and the ever changing flashing colors make for an amazing environment which doesn't stop moving when a good fight comes up. The camera work is so well done, it's always clear to see what the power of the current shot is. As an animation nerd myself I bow to this cinematic masterpiece.

I've talked enough, all in all I can only recommend this movie.

Get your tissues ready because you'll be in for an emotional rollercoaster!"
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic movie, might scare younger children though."
"Jan 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Linda historia y mensaje, muy entretenida, agradezco que no tenga inclusiones pero honestamente la fórmula para su éxito es que sus protagonistas y arcos son una copia de Sherk 1. Perrito=Burro, Gato=Fiona y Kitty=Sherk."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was good, very cute. My granddaughter and daughter loved it too."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie goes hard. Real hard. No reason to, but it does. The story, the characters, the morals, DEATH!?!?! Not a single thing to dislike about this movie. Best animated movie of 2022, Hands down."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,so good loved this movie
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a really phenomenal and very enjoyable DreamWorks animated family movie. It had really majestic animation, really amazing voice cast, really awesome action, really well done comedy, really thrilling adventure, really imaginative fantasy, very extraordinary music, really beautiful visuals and a really impressive plot. In my opinion, I think it’s one of my new favorite animated movies I’ve ever saw in theaters in my whole life. I really recommend this movie to both kid and adults."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" was one of the biggest surprises of 2022. This was not a movie that anyone was asking for, yet it was incredibly charming and fun. The film merges two animation styles, which are both gorgeous and cutting edge. There are moments of traditional DreamWorks animation and others that are similar to ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"".

The characters introduced in this film are reminiscent of those in the first two ""Shrek"" movies. Each character is carefully thought out, and evokes an emotional response, whether that be hope, fascination, or fear. From the confused Goldilocks to the adorable Perrito to the fearsome Lobo, everyone brings something new to the table.

There is honestly not a lot to criticize about ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"". The film hit darker notes than previous ""Shrek"" films and there were moments in the theater when kids shrieked. Some of the scenes are a little drawn out, but the story itself is strong.

For those with small children, be aware that there is a strong use of ""hell"" and some cleverly censored words throughout the movie. Otherwise, the film is perfectly appropriate (more than some other ""Shrek"" movies) for kids.

""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is the best animated film of 2022 and the best ""Shrek"" film since ""Shrek 2"" (not that the competition is very stiff). The animation is stunning, the voice-acting crisp, and the story is interesting for both children and adults. Even if you haven't seen the first ""Puss in Boots"", go and see this movie. You will not be disappointed.

Also, the new DreamWorks opening is excellent.

"Jan 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A children's movie this isn't. I have never heard a whole theatre full of children cry at once before. I had to hold my 5 year old grandchild in my lap and tell her it was all fake, I guess I should have done a little more research, but was caught up in the old story. No wonder 6 year old children are shooting their teachers. So sad. Satan is here."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Unexpected drops of ""hell"" and ""crap"" sprinkled throughout.  Was a great movie overall."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,beautiful movie. Good for children and adults
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,DreamWorks makes the best villains in my opinion and the mix of mature and for kid in the movie is mixed perfectly
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the visuals and animation! This film has a great style, fun character and a thought provoking story. It's a little dark so I wouldn't recommend it for younger kids but older kids and parents are sure to have a great time!"
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Super cute for all ages. Loved the sense of humor in it!
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Love this movie and would pay to watch again
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"amazing animation! Very well developed story, which refers to great animations (which are increasingly rare nowadays). Besides having a beautiful production! Sorry Pixar, after so many years DreamWorks is now my favorite studio."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,It had a very good story and it kept me intragued every second
"Jan 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,Some of the fight scenes in the movie seemed disjointed. Like some of the screenshots were missing or something.
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies of 2022. The wolf is the best movie villain of 2022. I don't care what anyone else says, but the wolf was perfect. The voice acting, the animation was just amazing. I really hope this movie makes 1 billion dollars in the box office and goes on to make a third Puss In Boots!"
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was one of my favorite animated movies in quite a while, DreamWorks proved once again it's one of the best. The music was great, the animation switches were perfect and the script was entertaining. This movie wears it's influences proudly on its sleeve and creates another classic (and particularly intimidating) villain."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"A very good and wholesome family movie. The voice acting was spot on, the story was spot on, and the animation was good as well. I especially loved the depiction of Death in this movie. I really hope the last scene is a hint that there will be a sequel and it will include you know who. :-)"
"Jan 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Great animation, great visuals for small children... that's about it"
"Jan 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"fun to watch, like the characters"
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of my new favorite movies EVER!!! I went to see it yesterday in theaters with my friends but today I'm going back to watch it in theaters again! It is a must see, please go see this in theaters and support this AMAZING MOVIE!!!!!"
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie!!! Loved it one of my favorite movies ever. Lots of Easter eggs and beautiful message at the end!!! Graphics are gorgeous. Best movie yet!!!
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything about this movie was perfect. The animation was gorgeous and the plot was mature yet funny at the same time. Recommend this for everyone
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful Animation, A great message about living your life to the fullest, A entertaining cast of characters, And a great story. One of the best-animated films I've seen in the past 3 years. I Recommended this movie to anyone that is a fan of animation as a medium"
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"My 19 and 20 yo old sons who grew up with this franchise went with their mates and both cohorts loved the movie which convinced us to go.  Thoroughly enjoyed it, it was funny, sad, great visual effects and animation, bits and pieces were maybe a little drawn out but so are parts of my everday life!  There were so many easter eggs and it was fun naming the various characters we recognised along the way.  Some say it's not a movie for young kids as there are some scary parts and if that's the case well it's definitely a movie they'll enjoy when they get older."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie has some of the most thrilling animation and impactful character development I've seen in a while. The villain is probably one of the best and most hauntingly threatening villains I've seen in an animation ever. 5 stars, go see it, it is a great installment to the franchise and a perfect stand-alone film as well as one of the best films Dreamworks has produced so far."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great humor for kids and adults. 
Parts were a little scary for my 8 yo grandson but he managed."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie 👍👌👌👌👌😍😍😍😍😍

"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"The pacing of the plot is absolutely spectacular, it handles its themes with much-appreciated maturity, and the balance of the tone between the serious and funny moments was spot on. Not only was this for sure one of the best movies of 2022, but after the first watch, it is certainly up in my top 5 of all time."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,I love the animation the storytelling and they did phenomenal with character development and designs. I would watch this movie again for the first time and love it all the same. Ten out of ten and I would recommend:)
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing, you have to watch this omg 10/10"
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"If there was be an award for best PART 2 movies of the last year or 2 Puss in Boots will be among the top 5. Highly recommended 😘
Banderas was amazing as always. Love his accent. 
Most kids watch more horrific cartoons than we can ever imagine and the villians in this movie will seem like a piece of cake for some of them but make sure that your kids are safe and able to watch this."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,So charming you'd want to see it twice. and I did.
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have no words. It was just so perfect for me. The animation is lit, the pacing was good, the villains are AMAZING. Puss' character development too was portrayed so well. Everything about is just so good. Even the side characters gets a good ending. I LOVE IT."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good family movie.
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Had a Blast with this movie!
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is by far one of the best movies of the year next to RRR and everything everywhere all at once, it's legit funny puss and the gang are so good in this movie that I loved watching everyone I wasn't bored or thought that was unneeded everyhting mixed so well. See this with your friends and family you won't regret and give this movie the love it deserve."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,It was funny for adults and kids
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,genial👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
"Jan 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's not a bad movie but it's not suitable for a 3 year old. Scared my granddaughter to the point she had to leave the theater.
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, not only for children, but for adult too"
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Almost feel bad for not watching it sooner.
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its absolute masterpiece, best animated movie and one of the best movies in history"
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,100% will watch again
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really love the artstyle and the plot of this movie, death was such a great character and i wish i could rewatch it without my memory of it again."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,I wasn't looking forward to this movie at all but now that I've seen I must say it's in my top 10 movies of all time! 100% go and watch it.
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,This was an amazing movie to watch. I loved all the hidden messages behind it and all the interaction between the characters.
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a fun ride through the Shrek-verse. It had great action and just enough story to keep both young and old entertained. It certainly seems that this universe will continue in some form. Let hope it maintains this level.
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing storyline and just right amount of time. It’s truly a fairy tale that brings magical feelings
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,This is actually the best movie of 2023. Haven’t seen an antagonist with the same level of screen presence as Lobo in ages. Does twice as much as Avatar 2 in less than half the time.
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing movie. The animation was eye candy and the story line was great. I loved the theme, and I loved how it grew up with the audience. Its mature yet also great for kids to watch. While it has a dark topic, it blends with the funny and exciting aspect that Dreamworks movies always have. 10/10 would DEFINITELY watch again."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,i think i just orgasmed
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a great experience in the theatres. I was more than a bit shocked that I could like a movie that seemed appealing to kids. The story about Goldilocks especially chocked me up. I'm a sucker for found family and it's done shockingly well in this movie. When you ignore some of the cringe, it's a very good movie with great character building."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Love it! Great story... the wolf was a bit scary but overall was a great movie.
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Liked the story line.  It was darker than the last one but enjoyed the movie.  Puss in boots is one of my favorite cartoon characters.
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"I feel like I was at a 21st century Revival and all I can say is amen, Amen and Amen!"
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"A surprisingly big upgrade from the last installment. 
The movie appears to take inspiration visually from Into The Spiderverse which is a nice suprise, a sequel to a spinoff didn't need to look this stunning! From character designs to the environment. 
As for the plot, it was heartfelt and charming. The feel of the movie felt grounded and not too over the top with the humour. Definitely something people of all ages would enjoy.
The Villans were all entertaining to watch, one of them clearly stands out from the rest. (don't want to spoil it)
I generally recommend this movie for any fan of animation or anyone wanting a sweet distraction for an hour and 40 minutes.
Good movie overall."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story line with new takes on fairy-tale characters.
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Now THIS is how you make a superior sequel to save a franchise. Definitely worth an Oscar Nomination!
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Disney should take notes , a well written story that has nothing ""progressive"" just a fun tale that everyone in the family can enjoy! Loved the movie and I love Dreamworks!"
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is one of the best animated movies I've seen, the lighting and the sound design were amazing along with the great writing has me thinking this is a masterpiece"
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great humor, interesting villain! Well worth the watch."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Very funny and full of heart
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a grade A film that seems to overachieve what the 2011 film dreamed to be. Highly recommend, especially for older audiences because for one, foul language is involved and two, Shrek."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Short but sweet movie....
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"comical, adventurous, and overall a really cute movie would watch again."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie very well done
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Best animation in years.
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,A movie with an important message of love. A nostalgic references to Shrek franchise in there.
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"The new villain is an edgy addition to the DreamWorks world, and its wonderful.  The characters development paths mixed with the child and adult humor was very funny. Whole film loved it."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Great family movie. Lots of action.
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,quite great loved it a lot meow meow
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Great life lessons and funny kid and adult humor!
"Jan 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Mortality tale but awfully loud for my taste.
I did like the animation"
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great family movie
We'll animated 
Good characters and writing"
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie, It was all around lots of fun and the animation was spectacular throughout. Love that studios are pushing the boundaries of animation like Into the Spider-verse did."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Anime style actions scenes were pretty cool & honestly unexpected.. overall adorable story
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Eu amei o filme num todo, ele é ótimo pra passar o tempo com a família e dar umas boas risadas. Ele tem efeitos gráficos ótimos sem muito exagero, as sátiras feitas durante o filme são ótimas e o fato de nós adultos nos identificarmos ou entendermos certas dores ou questionamentos do filme é o ponto chave... ele não trabalha tudo somente de um forma clichê, aborda de um forma mais profunda, tentando nos mostrar que certas coisas que desejamos já estão em nossas vidas a tempo, mas que são coisas que só tomamos noção quando desaceleramos."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly, I went into this not expecting much. HOWEVER, this movie was amazing for a few reasons: 1) it was a sequel but not watching the first PIB movie it felt like its own movie. 2) it was funny and lastly 3) the wolf was actually incredibly intimidating and had serious presence unlike any character I have seen in an animated film. The story was cute, funny, well written. It had amazing character development achieved and felt realistic in such a short period of time. Shrek universe  se has had many duds IMO but this movie was probably the second best only after the OG Shrek."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,A beautifully animated movie with intense and exciting action scenes and deep and mature themes of mortality and what it means to live a meaningful life.
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, the whole family loved it!"
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Funny, funny, funny."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was very entertaining and seemed to have good core values that all people could learn.
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,My whole family loved it! Great story.
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was a lot deeper than it seemed. I mean the whole plot with puss not appreciating his lives and death following him to try and kill him. I mean this movie was just amazing. Definitely a must watch.
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,I haven’t laughed this much since despicable me 2
"Jan 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I liked the jokes, I felt the movie was more for the adults who grew up with shrek and puss in boots. There were a few curse words or hints at curse words I would have nog liked to be in the movie rated PG. My 6 year old thought it was boring, so I would recommend this for the older kids and teens maybe."
"Jan 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,I didn’t get in the movies kicked out
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Was a fun and entertaining movie. Liked all the fairy tale elements in it
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,BEST DREAM WORKS MOVIE!!! The pacing was perfect. No slow parts. Every character fit perfectly into the story and almost all of them had their highlights. Highly recommend to any shriek fans and parents alike!
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, great pacing, great animation. Left the theater feeling very satisfied! Its a def must see!"
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun filled action with a lot of heart and personal growth
"Jan 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,Was silly the first one was better.
"Jan 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,The animation kinda shuffled between absolutely perfect and choppy/disjointed. The characters were fun enough also I enjoyed it.
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,I took my seven yr old Grandson and he absolutely loved it! Even I really enjoyed.
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"That movie is the best movie in the franchise right after ""Shrek 2"". It has a well-made story, captivating characters, incredible animation and deserves to watch on cinema. (Full Review in portuguese on my Instagram)"
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"The overarching villain might be my new favorite Dreamworks villain, he was downright sinister and the whistle to bring him into a scene had brought chills. All round, a great addition to the Shrek saga!"
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Better than Avatar in almost every way. This movie is amazing, even for two adults that haven't seen anything in the PussInVerse since Shrek 3"
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was great story was great visuals were great movie overall 10/10
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Honestly a really good movie and several parts made me tear up. Maybe not the best movie to recommend to children younger than 12 but when has a Shrek universe movie been appropriate lol
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved this movie! Definitely worth seeing!
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was an interesting movie. It had heart, some call backs to the Shrek movies and great animation. If you want a good movie to take the family to, Puss n Boots The Last Wish is worth a watch."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"Even though it doesn't use another banger lady gaga song it's a cinematic masterpiece and a must see, 
It's got a great villain, awesome animation style and a sweet message"
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Very cute movie for young and old!
"Jan 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ok plot with family at the end of it. Not understanding the need for""crap""and the beeps for words that cannot be used. Does a 8 yo need it or are the adults immature? The wolf (death) unnerved a few kids in the audience and his purpose went a bit over heads esp with the end. The fight scenes are like early Manga. Don't you miss movies before computer generated drawing. It is an average movie for a rainy day with 8 kids over 7 yo to crowd around. But mind the wolf..."
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,Puss the boots the last wish is a funny movie and I like it first and second we’re good
"Jan 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good story line. Good adaptation of fairy tale and nursery time. Lots of action for kids.
"Jan 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was fantastic! It was my son's first movie theater experience (brought his older sister too) and we all had a blast. The visuals, story, characters, and overall message all landed incredibly well. Favorite animated film for kids/ adults of the year by far. A top 5 movie experience for me for 2022- even though I saw it early 2023."
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a kids film; it's not going to blow your mind. But for a kids film, it is an awesome time. It's better than most movies out, with an all-round captivating crew of characters, including one of the best villain-ish characters (the wolf) that I've seen in a long time. All the characters are likeable and investable, and the emotional plot of the film is handled really well. Plus some good morals to boot. Fun, family friendly watch."
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, kis loved it!"
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was not what i was expecting, I thought it it was gonna be a generic side character movie like the first one was. But when i saw the animation style i and how it was influenced by Spider-Man: Into The Spider Verse i was hooked. This movie was aesthetingly pleasing and the movie premise was actually so good. This movie is on par with Shrek 2. I loved the antagonists and all the side characters like the dog perrito and Kitty Softpaws. I loved the main antagonists being Death and Jack Horner. Allthough i didnt know who the character ""Jack Horner"" was he was a very funny characters with his design and the way he acted with no regard for his goons. I also loved the way they described ""Death"" in this movie. They describe them as a scary character that has the motive of ""Death will always find you"" and ""wherever you run i will always find you"". This movie also has alot of character development, for example the protagonist; Puss In Boots is shown at first as an egoistic self centered person who sees himself like a living legend who doesnt fear death. But later when he dies and is down to his last life he encounters actuall death and is scared for his life running away, and as described in the movie, always comes back for him. This was probably one of the best animated movies i've ever seen."
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyable but not as good as original. Just didn’t develop a connection with new characters until late in the movie. Worthy effort but you can wait for streaming unless you are a big fan. 
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Didn't think the funny silly cat movie would make me emotional but wow. That was very sweet. Well worth the hype in every facet
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie - again great ideas … and one of the best villain cast I have seen in years (maybe since Heath Ledger as the Joker in Batman).
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Peak in boots 2 was amazing please go watch it
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful storyline that's not just a movie with amazing visuals. The screenwriting itself draws you in and helps us sympathize with the main character. Seeing different sides to him allows the audience to feel what he's feeling. The villains, visuals and tremendous voice acting makes for a fun, exciting and heartwarming adventure film everyone of all ages should see."
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,disliked-everything hunky dorey at the end.
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely the best one yet! Great action / adventure, characters involved were awesome, loved the life changes / lessons, great humor and happy ending. Def a must see!"
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything is just right.
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing character development, plot, humor, and introducing a hood villain in death. And for a kids movie I am very impressed"
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Just an explosion of emotions. Definitely recommend 10/10
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was absolutely amazing. A masterclass in story writing and pacing. Great characters all across the board. Most movies can't develop a single character properly in an entire 2h movie. This movie manages to develop and make you interested in 3 villains and 3 main characters all while advancing the film. I've never been a fan of children movies because of how simple their messages are. However, this movie is a one in a million.  Seriously great stuff, enjoyable for all the family ( lots of more mature jokes that land very well). It is as good as Shrek 2 ( and that is saying a lot!!!!)."
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie. I want Puss in boots to have my children, because he will raise them better than me"
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Kids really enjoyed this movie
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie has beautiful artstyle, has really good humor and has one of the best villains in any animation."
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing!! Purely amazing everything about the movie! Loved it! Hope they will continue.
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie for kids and adults alike.  Our grandkids giggled and laughed and the story line had a great lesson for them.
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I watched the latest Puss in Boots movie with my kids (8 and 5). This is the best one yet, and maybe sets up another adventure with Shrek & friend??? And what a great way to deal with a fear of death. This is a great movie for all ages."

"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a beautiful story!
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"(spoilers)

AMAZING MOVIEEE SUCH A NICE ANIMATION AND STYLE. i loved the cartoony approach, it may be a children's movie but man this story is so good and such a great message. i loved the unique character designs and personality's mixed with actual funny all around humor for everyone. the one thing i will critique is goldie and the bears, they just seemed useless. they were there only to be another antagonist. i felt they lacked a good use in the storyline. i liked their lesson but it just seemed meh. BUT OH MY GOD I LOVED THE WOLF. LITERALLY one of my favorite anganonists/villains of all time. he had such a relaxed and cold personality no fear just confidence in what he could do. he wanted to teach puss in boots to value your life and do be grateful. and once he understood he backed away, then pus and him agreeded that they would meet again because is death ""straight up"". the wolfs distant whistle such a simple tune is like death slowly creeping up. i loved jack horner too, he had such an amazing and funny design and personality. perito (the dog) was so cute too i loved pusses new start with kitty soft paws. overall such an amazing movie and it made me cry honestly, very funny as well."
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Very compelling plot
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Breathtaking animation and suprisingly emotional story, the films is no masterpiece but it's certainly wayyyyy above the vast majority of most kids' animation these days."
"Jan 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Depois de mais de 10 anos gato de botas ganha uma continuação que mantem a mesma diversão do primeiro, com poucos momentos engraçados e com um visual bonito"
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed this way more than a movie titled “puss in boots” should be enjoyed by a 36-year-old man. Great for all ages.
"Jan 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Movie was a bit predictable, but still a great time at the movies. Lots of humor and just a good time."
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really good. Well developed characters, good storytelling, villain was pretty cool too."

"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"PIB:TLW was so good. This movie was just amazing, and a great sequel to the spinoff. I prefer this to the first one, and if you know anyone who's watched all Shrek movies and the spinoff, this is a great movie for them. 10/10, would watch it again, and can't wait to stream it."
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"I am not even kidding this is the best movie I've ever watched. It exceeded expectations in a way I couldn't explain, it has the most intimidating villain I've ever witnessed on the big screen and it's better that any Disney movie that ever released, I swear to god"
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fun, humorous movie filled with adventure."

"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie. Only complaint is that the villains were a little intense for my 4/5 year old. But not anything he will have nightmares over I could tell it just bothered him a little. Incredibly funny, witty, simple, and the animation was so enjoyable. "

"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Mister Banderas is back and as good as (if not better) than ever! A wonderful story that may have just bridged the gap between Boots and Shrek! I sure there’s more though, and with the way it ended, there just may be! :)"
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the whole movie and I love Puss of Boots GREAT MOVIE ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Five Star Movie
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,really good movie went in with low expectations but movie out performed what I thought it's peak would be
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Mature, sweet, action packed, and funny. This amazingly animated film is the best DreamWorks has put out since Httyd 2."
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing, I love this new animation style dreamworks is going with."
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,I did not beleve this movie could be as heartfelt as it is. If you are able to see it in the theaters you should do so. Definitely getting this when it is out on disk.
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,I can't believe I'm saying this: but this might be my favorite DreamWorks movie ever. From the animation to the story.... It's all so perfect
"Jan 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is the best animated film that 2022 has to offer, and DreamWorks Animation's best movie. I give this movie an A+."
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Gorgeous animation, beautiful and mature story, compelling and hilarious characters, beautiful finale, no amount of praise could justify just how good this movie is. Go watch it, the hype for it is not understated, in fact it's more than deserved."
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I took my grandsons 9 & 6 and we loved it!!!
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,cute movie for kids and family
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,As good as shrek 1-2
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,my kids like it very good movie
"Jan 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,I didn't understand the plot.
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I LOVED IT!!!! Absolutely amazing!!! The animation, the style, the funny hilarious bleep out words. Oh I just loved it. Definitely my favorite movie of the DECADE!"
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I LOVED IT. Let me start by saying that I’m a big Shrek fan…but I’ve never had ANY interest watching the Puss In Boots movies through the years. Now that I’ve got two young kids (4,6) of my own, I thought this movie would be great to watch together as a family. It was INCREDIBLE. The animation was amazing, the voice acting was great, the Shrek references were fun, and overall, I think I was enjoying it WAY more than my kids haha. The antagonist is actually pretty scary and I had to reassure my kids during the scary parts. If you have small kids, you need to be aware that the scary parts are SCARY. Other than that, I HOPE they can do more movies in this Shrek universe. It was fantastic."
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,First time I took my 3 year old son to the movies and he had so much fun!!
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny and enjoyable movie! recommended for all ages
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I took my Granddaughter and it was the absolute best movie ever for her and me!
We both LOVED It!"
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it so much!! The animation and experience was incredible!!
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is amazing.
The drop in frame rate with the fight sceans are amazing,so is the animation.
Death is amazing charcter,really all the characters in this film are at the very least good or eh.

If you see one movie this year please see this one,the animator put time into it."
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning, emotionally touching, and such a great time! Worth a second watch. I am absolutely in love with dreamworks and this really brough back what dreamworks is all about."
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it I want to see it again. I cried at least 2x.
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"It may be the best animated film I have ever seen. Mature issues like Inside Out, action like Spider Man: Into the Spiderverse, and funny like Shrek. This movie likely would have scared me when I was 10. However, as a 19-year-old, I loved this movie. It nearly made me cry multiple times as well as made me laugh very hard multiple times. There are very few movies that can find that balance, much less an animated movie doing it better than most. Definitely go see this movie. 95/100
KT"
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"The film has almost all the perfect elements, from direction, to voice acting, to the animation style, to the score, and handles many characters with ease. Definitely a top-tier show from DreamWorks Animation Studio, and easily the best animated film of 2022, heck even the best animated film of the COVID-era. Completely satisfied!"
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Really awesome animation style and a pretty fun plot. It's a fun movie that I really enjoyed
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,The star power voices of Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek carry this movie with not just its usual animation humour but brings along an interesting cast of characters. Combined that with a great story line that caters for young and old which keeps you engaged and addresses what's important in life's many lessons. Great sequel in the Shrek Universe and improves on the original.
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny touching and profound. With the picture book style action scene like the Spiderman into the spiderverse.
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in boots the last wish is one of the best films in 2022, even might be my favourite of the whole year, if this movie succeeds, this will be a great future for Dream works, would watch multiple times"
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing quirky animations and good storyline and comedy.
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think that Dreamworks did a very good Job with this film,unlike Marvel which lightly flopped this year. Mot to mention the story is very good too"
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Like a normal ""Shrek's"" movies with so much more of everything and a ""Dog""."
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's touching,  puss iscso charming plus Antonio Banderas voice makes it even more charming. It has lots of action, is funny at timesca bit sad, but overall very nice"
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,I was not expecting to enjoy this movie so much.
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought this movie was going to be kinda generic but I love the character so I went to see It anyway and I was amazed at how great this movie was, I can't recommend it enough."
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,My favorite animated movie of 2022. DreamWorks always puts out amazing movies for fans. Such a fun/heartwarming story around Puss and other characters in the movie.
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie I call a cinematic masterpiece. The layers and depth to the film were extraordinary with fun for the kids and deep messages for the older. So many metaphors and call backs to original scenes almost me to tears. 
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is amazing, I honestly cannot see any flaws within this. The characters are FANTASTIC, humor is very good, animation is GORGEOUS! The movie knows when to be serious and it genuinely knows how to make the audience feel exactly what Puss is feeling. It tackles fear in a very unique and interesting way and I'm so glad we got this movie. Do not let it flop."
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny! Sad! Awesome! Makes you appreciate what you have! And not take things for granted! Can’t wait for the meet up with puss old friends in the city of far far away
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,a great take on appreciating life in fantastic animation
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing in so many ways, loved every bit from animation to the story. The only thing keeping it from perfect is (spoiler) the constant To soft to hard and just right thing the bears and Goldie do way too often."
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie , phenomenal way to represent puss and no matter how old you get dream works didn’t miss with this film literally so funny & sad at the same time but the meaning given to the audience goes a long way 3"
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Super good message, super cute, and super funny"
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Very cute and entertaining.
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the best dream works movies by far
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Great feel good movie.  Lots of laughs too.
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Me and my wife actually great fan of puss in boots !!!  We just returned from cinema and it was absolutely great !!!! Ty so much <3
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie!! Animation was so clean and the whole movie was funny. Highly recommend seeing it!
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Interesting story, excellent animation."
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny story with a family focused message.
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,This was the best animation I have seen in a movie in my life. The way it flows in fight scenes is so satisfying and how they actually pulled of making such a vibrant style look scary with the wolf was really impressive to see. it was nice to actually see some development of puss as a character for a change and some action on top of it all in all amazing movie!
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Clever and entertaining.
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"creativity is crazy, detail is crazy, it's just carried all other 2022 movies with something new and enjoyable"
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Cute, feel good story line.  It's talking animals, what's not to like?"
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty good movie.  Exciting qnd fun!
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I haven’t liked anything dreamworks has made in the past 5 years but this was the best movie experience of 2022. I was so surprised that the movie managed to balance 3 different antagonists. The final act was beautifully animated and so much fun. The story is simple and understandable for kids but the movie isn’t hamfisted my group of adult friends were not irritated by any of the dialogue or choices the characters made. After watching avatar 2, I still think I would prefer watch this movie twice than watch avatar 2."
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Took my 9 year old daughter to see Puss In Boots and surprisingly it was better than I expected.
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Jesus Christ, this sh*t goes hard. Best Dreamworks movie since Kung Fu Panda 2. I loved every second of this movie."
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,A really fun and interesting movie to see with visible and God character development. With one the best antagonists.
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"A film filled with action, heart, and great storytelling."
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I took my niece and we both laughed quite a bit. It was sweet and funny. The acting was great and it was visually very unique for a kids film.
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"great animation, great story."
"Jan 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I didn't get to watch it all, i enjoyed what i saw of it."
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie handled a really dark and difficult topic extraordinarily well, balancing it out with a lot of humour. Even as an adult, The Last Wish was super enjoyable and one of my favourite movies this year."
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was an absolute treat to watch, I haven't been a fan of animated movies for years now but the amount of passion, the storytelling, the character progression, the carefully crafted humor and how badass the main villain was made this my favorite animated movie of the past 10+ years easily. I hugely recommend this fantastic film"
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,My whole family loved the movie. Its was super funny
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,A little confusion about the purchase at the theater but we sorted it out! :) Love the convenience.
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"¡qué obra maestra!
Incredible cast, characters and story! Fighting with Shrek 2 as bast Dreamworks film"
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Walked out of the theater and realized I no longer fear death.
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,The song fearless here was amazing
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved this movie… It was better than I expected!
"Jan 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Są koty na ekranie i jest fajnie. Fabularnie nie oczekujcie zbyt wiele, ale nadrabiane jest to żartami (nie dla dzieci) oraz animacją podobną do spiderverse"
"Jan 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I love cats!, & cute Spanish accents (Banderas).  Otherwise 'POOS' n Boots just passsed the time for me, but it was almost continuous action and tense adventure with humor and charm and interesting cartoon graphics.  Saw it at 'lerton with AMC A-LIST Tix.  Big crowd laffed a lot.  Giving it 3 RT stars, meh.
listen to my audio remarks for more details."
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was SO MUCH BETTER than the first one! And that's cause I loved the first one as well! Hands down, this movie is probably the best movie I've seen in a couple years! I extremely loved it!! So much humor and likeable characters this movie is absolutely fascinating. Planning to watch it again next week. Go watch!! You will NOT REGRET!!"
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This moive, wasn't one i thought would be that great. Thought it would be a typical kids moive. But this moive, this. Is literally my favorite moive of the year. Its amazing the animation is amazing and beautiful, the story is greatly told and oh my gawd, that wolf terrifys me. This moive is unexpectedly kinda adulty.. and i love it! Point is, watch this moive, its amazing and it deserves the attention it needs."
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was a great movie, with a good  storyline, and a new style of animation, similar to spiderman into the spider-verse, loved it, had great action sequences, watch out for the little ones, and a good bit of darker humor like Shrek, overall I and my son both enjoyed it"
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a very well-made movie.  You have to weather the first 10 minutes.  Very cringey and self-congratulatory.  Hard to watch and over the top.  Wish they could have conveyed the cat's arrogance in a way that was easier to watch, but it is what it is.  But by the end of the movie my daughter and I are both wiping tears out of our eyes.  I LOVED how they drew on other familiar fairy tales.  So dang funny.  And the wolf.  Oh my gosh, what a character! We all were so impressed with the wolf."
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love this movie it is an absolutely amazing movie, i loved the ending of the movie. Believe me if you love puss in boots you will love this movie. i'm not a huge fan of puss in boots and I loved this movie I would definitely watch it again, and definitely recommend for you to watch it."
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Far exceeded my expectations based on the trailers.
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,the movie has amazing character development both ways (antagonist/protagonist) the animation in this case is sweet and cozy i enjoyed the wide palette of vivid colors within the movie the plot leaves a good message it is a very well made movie It exceeds my expectations coming from a children's movie
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Muy buen mensaje y k hablaron espaol eso me encanto
"Jan 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I haven't watch the other movies so I cant compare, but this one is good. Funny and describe the feelings of fear and diffident from different angles. Enjoyed how DreamWorks included different stories from different characters we know."
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Really liked this movie the animation was beautiful.And the characters were really interesting.Really cool and smooth villain and a nice ending.
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,An animated masterpiece.
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Surprisingly good, rare when a sequel does that."
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was skeptical for a plethora of reasons about this movie. I've liked the past installments, and even the TV series was ok. But this movie literally blew me away. The story is fantastic, the character development is realistic. The connections seem are genuine and heartwarming. 
And the action...oh my god...the ""choreography"" of each action piece was outstanding, and the handling of each characters strengths and weaknesses were fantastic. Even the payoffs to goofy plot devices like Perrito learning dough eyes was well used. The antagonists and villains were so spot on. And the bounty hunter arch was amazing. The first few scenes were so fantastically done that I didn't think it would keep it up through a few sections, but it just kept being amazing. 
It really feels like the producers were told to just make a good movie, and that's what they were done. I don't feel the hand of the studio in this at all, just an amazingly well done animated film. And an absolute see in the theaters experience, as well.
The low frame rate, Spiderverse style animation moments made me feel like they were going to try to pointlessly capitalize on that style, but they really utilized it to elevate the action sections, even using the style to contrast standard animation motion to push parts of the narrative and character development. Fucking SPLENDID film."
"Jan 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,Okay. Not sure why all the hype. Not Great for 3 to 6 year olds. The jokes and laughs go right over kids heads. I guess that’s the point. But not for little kids. 
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Death was da truth!
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Went in with zero expectations, and left the theater with a smile on my face. Is not a generic, basic kids movie. Dreamworks understood the value that Puss in Boots gained over the years, and gave the character an evolution we didn't know it needed. A strong story filled with valuable messages for the young audiences, but without losing the charm of an already well-established universe (both from the Shrek movies and the previous standalone Puss in Boots film)."
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots was entertaining, funny, and family friendly with a little bit for kids and a little bit for adults to enjoy. Finally a non political, non social movie that was just pure fun!
Would recommend highly."
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,it was cute but not as funny as I hoped for
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a really good movie
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,this movie is so fire guys everyone go see it now
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I grew up a huge fan of the Shrek franchise. This film is on par with Shrek and Shrek 2. There is a Shrek and Donkey dynamic with Puss and Boots and another Character in the film. I wish I could say more, but I am scared I would spoil the movie. Go see it!"
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,AMAZING MOVIE 😃😃😃😃😃
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Feel good movie that also shows the dark side of humans well known already to us animal lovers.
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Very funny and the animation was awesome
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was funny, great storyline, and sweet. I enjoyed the movie with my partner . Will watch again!"
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought itt will be a souless reboot. I was dead wrong. Dreamworks played well with the audio and antagonists were also really good
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Está hermosa, realmente te mantiene atento y emocionado durante toda la película"
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Extremely funny with phenomenal animation,  a touching sorry, fun characters and complex situations. Very creative."
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went in to this film aware of the fact it was surprisingly good, yet a small part of me believed it was just a morbius situation where everyone pretended it was amazing, however I was plenty surprised
Right from the start you can see how they took the animation from spiderverse but twisted and turned it to create their own version which made the opening fight amazing to watch
The film was somehow able to manage theee villains at once and not one felt too used or under used, I will not talk about the third one as from the way the advertisements seem to refrain from mentioning him I get the idea he's meant to be a surprise antag
Death himself was one of the greatest villains in animation history even when he only has a few actual confrontations with puss as he perfers to watch from the shadows with his red eyes and honestly horrifying to the bone tune 
The other villain is the goldilocks crime family, who while at first seemed out of place definitely fit in near the end, being a mix of comic relief and evilness, while it was quite easy to determine how their story would play out and end they were still a great addition to the story 
All in all puss in boots 2 is a great film that isn't scared to go pass the limits of a ""children film"" and become actually scary at times while having actual character development for a talking cat"
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, definitely better than the first one. I all most cried multiple times and the scary scenes where actually scary. Bruh go watch the movie, you won't regret it."
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Cute, funny, loved it 💖"
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"It brings another beautiful chapter and character wroth in Puss. Referencing many wonderful movies to an end that made me cry, cause of hope!"
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely stunning, visually and story wise. Animation is phenomenal and the themes of the movie are captivating and fresh for an animated movie"
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,lol actually hella funny..funniest movie in all shrek collections
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than any thing Disney put out in 2022. Wholesome family movie everyone can enjoy without an agenda being pushed on their children. Had a great heartfelt message that can be appreciated at the center. If anyone’s tired of what Disney has put out this last year then go support this film.
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Come on Disney, you’re lacking…. But this movie was awesome 👏 Go Dreamworks!"
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Another banger dream works movie.
"Jan 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,Antonio's voice is great as usual. The movie was slow. I noticed little kids lost interest.
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was amazing, life changing if you will. I was raised watching the original puss in boots movie. It was so dear to me. So when I heard there was going to be a sequel I hoped and hoped it would live up to the expectations of my childhood. WELL IT DID. the animation is beautiful and full of life. It's colorful and doesn't feel synthetic or corporate like the latest disney movie animation has been. The jokes are actually funny. There are definitely a few jokes only adults would understand and they used very very mild curse words but it works! The dialogue fits the movie in my opinion and I loved how they also used a lot more spainish in this movie! They also made sure there wasnt english subtitles so those jokes are only for the spainish speakers in there hehe (me included lol). The characters were also really good, none of them annoyed me which is suprizing because usually in cartoon movies there is some kind of side kick or something that just gets on my nerves but there wasnt any in this movie! The character design is one of my favorite aspects of the movie. And the jabs at Disney were really funny aswell. The story also really hit home and made me tear up a bit since I deal with some of the things that were talked about in the movie (spoiler?: mostly puss's anxiety of death and living up to his ""legend"" also the therapy dog reminded me of my cat who is kind of like my therapy animal lol). Anyways the story was 10/10, everything was 10/10 and I would definitely watch it over and over again. And I hope DreamWorks continues making great sequels and movies like this!!!"
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie!!! Food was super expensive
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story for all ages!
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great movie overall, plus a hint of comedy! A must see movie!"
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfectly paced for a childrens movie. Entertaining for both adults and children. A positive message done in a very charming way
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was very enjoyable. Extremely a fan of how they portrayed running away from your fears and eventually having to face them. Animation was fluid and very well done too.
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Nonstop well done action
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was a interesting, fun to watch movie even for an older audience. It was clearly not a cashgrab like some other movies recently and was clearly thought out. Unique storyline and idea. The whole concept of death being around following made it also seem to have stakes, meaning the characters actions would actually have affect on the future. It also wasn't a cringe fest like some other new animated movies are, and each character has a unique backstory and reason to want the star. Watch it, I highly recommend it."
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Witty and consistent with other movies and series. Loved it.
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"The animation and story was awesome, we really liked why they did with the animation this movie"
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Great animation and a good storyline. Not your average animated sequel!
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ok so I have never been a fan of the Shrek series. This movie though—-wow!!! I only went because my 10 yo daughter wanted to see it, and I was super impressed!! The animation of phenomenal, the story is fantastic, and it keeps you guessing!! Such a great movie—-already watched it twice (had to take my 20 yo son to see it!), and will definitely watch it again!"
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,It was an absolutely amazing. Fantastic animation and characters. Amazing ending that I won’t spoil ) Everyone of all ages will enjoy this. AMAZING
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,This was unlike any other movie it was perfect
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Very cute for the kids and had some funny parts for adults too!
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved how charecters learned how to trust on each other and that mistakes can be forgiven.
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,I was expecting this movie to be annoying. I was wrong. It was beautiful. Highly recommend.
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great for a kids movie, and plenty of fun for the adults in the family as well."
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,absolute masterpiece of a movie.
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie had no reason to go as hard as it did but Dreamworks is at it again making banger sequels that never miss man would a fantastic film.
"Jan 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,Too much inappropriate language for a kid's movie. It wasn't necessary and it was all my kids noticed or remembered from the movie.
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Very funny!  Grandkids loved it!
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good good go se it
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,My 3 kids and I absolutely loved this movie. Besides a few completely unnecessary curse words it was a great movie. It was refreshing to take my family to a movie that wasn't politically over the top and annoying.
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Where do I even begin. I walked into the theater expecting a mildly interesting action adventure movie about a talking cat wearing boots and I was pleasantly surprised. This movie is absolutely amazing, and I don't say that lightly. For starters, the writing for the characters was simply outstanding. When I saw that there was many characters, I was worried that some of the characters would be tossed to the side a little too easily and that others would receive too much spotlight but no! Each character had depth and added something interesting to the movie. I didn't dislike a single character and not once did I feel like any character under/overstayed their welcome. I also enjoyed the humor. Many movies targeted towards children nowadays just use crude, unfunny humor to try to appeal kids but this movie is actually funny. The jokes don't feel forced and I found myself audibly laughing at many gags. The animation left me speechless. It was incredible. Not a second of screen time was wasted and every frame was vibrant and full of life. Some scenes, you could see every hair on Puss's face and on others, unshed tears glistening in his eyes. The style was definitely inspired by Spiderman: Into the Spider-verse but didn't feel like a copy. The film takes that comic book style and warps it into its very own unique version. The paintbrush aesthetic adds so much color and depth to each scene, giving the viewers some amazing scenery. The fight scenes were action packed and well choreographed. During many of them, especially during Puss's final fight with Death, I could feel my heart pounding in anticipation. Will he win, will he loose? The fights keep you entertained and on your toes, it's outrageously good. While the plot felt a little simple, it feels intentional so that the movie can focus more on the compelling characters and settings. The forest where most of the movie takes place is such an interesting concept, the landscape changing depending on who was holding the map led to some great animation and ideas. The movie took a huge risk with three main antagonists and it thankfully, pulls it off well! I adored Goldilocks relationship with the three bears and her emotional inner turmoil was a great addition to the story. I also enjoyed John Mulaney's role as Jack Horner and while he did feel like the weakest villain, he makes up for it by being incredibly funny. I don't even know how to describe the third antagonist, the wolf, who was the embodiment of death. The wolf was genuinely scary. His bright red eyes standing out against the darker tones of the scenes he was in was so visually pleasing. Watching death himself stalk Puss the entire movie was chilling and compelling. From the very moment he appeared on screen, I could tell he was going to be one of the best parts of the movie. Watching Puss run away from the fight and have a full blown panic attack in the woods truly showed the audience just how much of a threat the wolf was. The movie didn't treat the wolf like a joke and didn't present him lightly. He is death. I don't mean that metaphorically, or rhetorically, or poetically, or theoretically, or any other fancy way. He is death. This review is crazy long and I am starting to ramble so I will end this with an overall rating. 

Humor- 9.5/10
Characters- 9.5/10
Plot- 8/10
Animation- 10/10
Overall- 9.5/10

I strongly recommend watching this movie. It is 100% worth the watch. It is a great movie to let loose and forget about boring day to day life too. Let yourself be immersed in the colorful, compelling world with fun meaningful characters, great music, funny jokes, and amazing animation."
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyable family movie
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Its geat. It's almost best move i have seen in my opinion. dreamwork respect...

"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Very funny and entertaining. Grandkids loved it. Hope there’s a sequel.
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"So funny and being 21 I thought I wouldn’t enjoy it, but the comedy is for adults and kid alike!"
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining for the kids
"Jan 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The wolf absolutely terrified my daughter, dad fail! "
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed it! It gave it the wrap it needed.
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie with a fanatastic story, message, and villians. Every character in the movie is great with the wolf and the cricket being absolutely fantastic. The music is incredible all the way through and the visuals are beautiful. A truly great animated movie."
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Great balance of fun and darkness
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Adventure, humor, romance)"
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything about this movie is stellar. Go watch it
"Jan 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was ok. Not that funny. Just ok.
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Plenty of silliness for the kids as well as jokes that adults appreciate. Thats the Way to go to have a successful kids movie.
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was super cute!  Big fat guy was uncalled for but besides him, all was pretty awesome!"
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,An absolute anachronistic masterpiece
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it! The simple yet fascinating story is a must watch
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great characters, action, amazing and scary villian, great story and animation. Plus a couple of cameos. Must watch!"
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie shocked me, honestly. go see it, it's worth your time and money"
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"omg

this had no right to be as good as it was."
"Jan 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,I always love the puss in boots character. Good entertaining family film with lots of laughs
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Cute movie- very entertaining and funny.
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually striking, emotional, and above all, funny as hell, this is giant step forward for the company. Leagues better than the first movie, and just as inventive as the first two Shrek films, this will become a new classic for the DWA fans."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is unbelieveable how good this movie is. If that's the future of animation, it's gonna be a good one"
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's wonderful!

I like the conceit of two cats and a dog traveling together, learning from one another... At first the cats (crafty, combative, suspicious) cannot believe how gullible and foolish this ""ridiculous"" dog is... but in time they learn to be a little more doglike (trusting and affectionate) and he learns to be a little more catlike (savvy and discerning). It's nice :)

I like the physical gags, eg, where the anthropomorphic Puss in Boots reverts to his base feline nature. I like the character design of Goldilocks and The Three Bears. I think it's visually beautiful much of the time.

Most of all I love the bold, Thoreau-ean message, beautifully manifested into a literal fight sequence at the end of the film: that we must learn to cherish, defend, and embrace-- with passion and without fear-- the one short and precious life we have, and stop passively wasting our time away, wishing for an easy fix."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went to this movie with my wife very optimistic and left telling everyone I could think of that this is the best movie ever. If it isn't that, it is the best feel good movie ever. I got home and started looking for a ""team friendship"" tshirt and couldn't find one. If I don't find one soon I will start selling them and will be rich. This movie is awesome."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Good message about life values
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Big battle at end. Didn't like 1st part.
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"DreamWorks has debuted great villains in the past, but this might be their greatest villain on screen yet. Combine spectacular humor for children and adults with a shockingly deep message and you get this movie. The wolf antagonist and thought provoking message of the film alone more than earn the current 95% score RT gave it. Please go see this, adults and children alike won't be disappointed!"
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful animation, great character, dynamic action scenes, and a mature story. One of Dreamworks bests."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,This gorgeously animated tale breathes new life into the formula of turning fairy tales on their heads while still retaining a sense of wonder guaranteed to draw in kids and adults alike.
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Witty and fun even for adults
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Funny, fast-paced and enjoyable for adults and kids. Great character development!"
"Jan 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was okay. It was less than I expected. My granddaughter thought it was too long. 
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its Puss in boots, you can't go wrong with this character"
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I had not seen any of the other Puss in Boots movies so I was a bit skeptical that I would like it but this was such a cute movie! The storyline was so creative and kept us captivated the whole time. Highly recommend even if you haven't seen any other Puss in Boots movies.
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Sweet little movie. 
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome animation style, a heart-warming story and great comic relief all neatly packed in a well-paced movie!"
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely an amazing follow up to Puss in Boots, that really wants me to see more of the Shrek universe, a must watch one of the best animated movies of 2022"
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I love Puss in Boots and this was another great adventure. It was good to see Puss back with Kitty as well as their new companion. The graphics we're good on it as well.
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie for childern. Dreamworks >>> Disney.
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Love. Cute story. Little Perito will win your heart.
"Jan 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The animation was bad at times, a little too long, and one of the villains was over the top. Other than really enjoyed myself."
"Jan 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good movie for little kids.
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I rarely hand out five stars but this film overachieves in every category. I recommend it to anyone who is at least vaguely familiar with the character, it’s innocent fun and an amazing story with villains that make you laugh cry and shake in your seat. One of the villains IS a bit scary for younger audiences, so I recommend checking the maturity level of your child before buying a ticket. However, the scary character is by far some of the best parts of the movie so do not let that drive you away."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was not expecting it to be this good. animation, plot, character writing and absolutely everything else was so enjoyable. I absolutely recommend it to anyone who enjoys animation as much as me. 
(possible spoiler below for those who wanna go in completely blind)

I feel like cat lady's house scene was bit too long, but I'm not making it lose a score over it because actual adventure makes up for it by being amazing from start to finish."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Great writing. It's fun and funny while at the same time (without getting too emotional) touches on the themes of battling death and makes you think about what is important in life.
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I really loved the movie Its great for kids but also has a few scenes that adults may like to if you aren't an avid movie watcher you may not follow very well but still great.
"Jan 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,Wonderful sequel. Loved the new characters.
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic movie, with lots of funny parts for kids and adults.  The story was engaging and kept our attention the whole time."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Wholesome movie that was well animated and kept my 8 year olds attention the whole way through.
"Jan 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,Didn't like the first half but the last half was what kept me watching and had a great ending!
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Animation is fresh.  Loved the new takes on classic nursery stories, especially the goldilocks subplot."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best animated movies I have seen in a while. Every frame of the movie was so well made, every second was entertaining, and every character was interesting. I have literally no problems with it. After watching it, I just wanted to watch it again. One of the only animated movies I laugh out loud so much, I probably disturbed the people in the theater lol."
"Jan 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not kid friendly- crude, boring, save your money."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining! Would've given 5 stars but it was a little scary at times for my 4 year old, but overall we loved it!"
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed it! It was funny, suspenseful, and heartfelt"
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was really awesome, would recommend families to see. DreamWorks tried something different in there sequel for Puss in Boots and they nailed it. The animation, the pacing, and the villians are just spot on. Death was a really good villian and would be in my top 5 favorite dream work villians. Besides all of that, you guys need to see it."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story!  Lot's of action, liked all of the characters.  This was very enjoyable for my son and I."
"Jan 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Too noisy and chaotic, too disorienting for smaller children. Funny thing was, I liked it better than the three grandkids did (12, 8, and 4 y/o)"
"Jan 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Dark...""Death"" is a scary wolf? chasing Puss throughout the movie.  This, alone, makes this movie inappropriate for little kids.  Not fun."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome conclusion to the Puss character from the Shrek universe. Due to the appearance of death plus some minor profanity, this film might not be appropriate for younger kids."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Very exciting and humorous.
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"How do I even get started with how extraordinary and awesome this movie is. It was beyond everybody's expectations. In all aspects, the animation, art style, action, story, characters and development was Top Notch. But what so impressive about this movie that stood out to me was the immense Depth, meaning, and emotions ingrained inside it. This movie isn't just a kids film, it has deep spiritual meaning. And I am sitting there blown away by the scenes and wondering if anybody else is getting it too? 
The character death is a manifestation of Puss's fear and anxiety collected over his past lives. In this journey, his old identity went through a whole breakthrough and he had to face his fear which he has avoided for all his lives. It was pretty summed like a Dark of night the soul? Then there was the character Perrito which really shines through the story, whom was the exact epitome of innocence, joy and purity? Even after going through such a tremendous sorrows, he was still vastly unaffected and is able to keep an attitude of unwavering positivity and lightheartedness? That, truly, is a character of enlightened nature. I feel that his had so much to teach all of us, that despite whatever that happens to us, it was perception that created our reality."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Funny, and sad at times. 
Awesome movie!!!
I look forward to continuing with Shrek and co."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie had great animation and characters, but there were some moments that didn't seem to fit in the movie."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I made a Rotten Tomatoes account just to gush about how phenomenal this movie is. Not only is it stunning visually, but the story tackles incredibly deep and profound topics. I never would have expected a Puss in Boots sequel of all things to be about panic and anxiety and existential dread. Every character is given just enough development for the purpose they serve without feeling like they are overdeveloping someone, or ignoring someone who needed more depth for the part they play. This movie was full of characters, and the fact that they managed to somehow neatly place them all into the story baffles me as an aspiring writer. The wolf is obviously incredible and horrifying. His presence mixed with Puss's fear, amazingly brought to life by the character animation, puts you right into the scene with them. Even Perrito is a fantastic addition to the cast. Making him the only character who frequently curses is a hilarious subversion. I also think that Jack Horner is really funny. I haven't seen him talked about as much but I find his irredeemably cruel personality really great, especially since it fits the whole -death- theme of the movie. Please go see it in theatres, I could go on and on about every aspect but it's better if you see it yourself."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I know what you're thinking. ""Puss in Boots 2? The sequel to that mediocre movie about the funny little cat from Shrek that came out over a decade ago?"" My entire family laughed at me when I told them I was going to see Puss in Boots 2 in the theater. But please trust me when I say that this movie is a masterpiece for kids and adults equally. Nothing I say can prepare you for how unironically and extraordinarily good this film is. I cannot believe it hasn't even grossed a tenth of what Avatar: The Way of Water has worldwide. We need to support this movie so that Dreamworks understands that we see it and that we want more like it.

On the surface, it may seem like a quaint little movie about Puss and the frankly generic hero's struggle with overcoming an inflated ego, but it's so much more than that. Without giving away too much, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish dives headfirst into very emotionally mature topics in a way that I seldom see in movies- animated or otherwise. Throughout the film, Puss grapples with the reality of mortality, and it's genuinely terrifying and impactful.

I feel like this movie really showed off how animation is a medium that deserves respect. There are some aspects of this movie that just wouldn't work in a live-action film, and I adore that. The exaggerated anatomy during fight scenes, a certain red-eyed wolf villain, and the incredible character acting are all things that I can't imagine being executed as flawlessly as they did in the limitless medium of animation. The painterly brush strokes in the environment and characters really fit the fairytale genre. I was just blown away by the beauty packed in every single frame.

The fact that the pacing was so flawless despite there being 3 main villains and 3 main protagonists to give appropriate amounts of screentime was absolutely insane. At no point did it feel like we spent too long or too little on one character, and everyone's motives and actions felt in-character, justified, and well thought out. To me, this is what cinema is. This is what it's all about. Not a wasted shot, not a wasted line, not a wasted second. Perfect intention in every moment. Every second is dense with beautiful visuals and rich storytelling."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,The best animated film for 2022. Trust me. 
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Very enjoyable movie so good and the villain is perfect
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Whats weird was I honestly didnt see too much promotion for this movie, so it made me a little worried upon going in. What I instead got to witness was a fun, emotional, adventure thats clawed its way in to my heart. From beautiful animation to beautiful performances from the actors and actresses delivering a story that deserves a spot on anyone shelf, its easily become one of my favorites that I cant wait to own just to experience it again and again. Its truly a beautiful movie with heart that I havent seen in a little while. Cant wait to see it again"
"Jan 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is poorly rated for kids. In appropriate humor/ remarks and extremely  dark for a childrens movie. We had a large group of about 9 kids ranging from 2-13 that watched, each one had mixed feelings from being afraid, to feeling uncomfortable, and generally disappointed.
Definitely will not watch another movie from this franchise after this."
"Jan 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,Wasnt quite as funny as the first movie. I loved the action scenes in the movie as well as the story line.
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"the death character was incredible, as an adult I left feeling oddly moved a bit. great film"
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie with a good message and humor.
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,nice movie. saw it on 3D. it was excellent movie.
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this movie with my kids, It was really good and funny."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"The animation films, of recent, have been too safe. They don't risk much, and therefore earn decent rewards in the box office.
This movie, however, was an incredible risk. Reviving an 11-year dead franchise with a mediocre spin-off franchise's sequel film? That's nearly unheard of. And somehow, they made it work.
The Last Wish is the greatest representation of anxiety and PTSD I have ever encountered, and that's coming from someone with an anxiety disorder. Puss's anxiety attack was so real. His fear blinded him, and the comfort of those he was near to helped him through such a traumatic experience.
Again, the revival of the Shrek universe wasn't something I was looking forward to, but DreamWorks brought their A-game. The vibrant animation style, enticing soundtrack, well-written characters, and beautiful story is amazing.
9.5/10. Watched twice and tempted to go for a third. Expect me on opening night for Shrek 5."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Creative puns and throwbacks 
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,My 7 year old loves this movie and so did we. Super cute and funny definitely recommend.

"Jan 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a cute movie. Had some slow parts.
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,My sons loved all the characters and how the fairytale characters were involved and he made a connection that they were not in their normal setting.
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I went into this movie with medium expectations. I liked Puss and Boots as a character in Shrek 2 but hadnt had much exposure otherwise. This was a PHENOMENAL movie. The villain(s) is/are some of the best ever created by Dreamworks. ESPECIALLY the suprise reveal of the true identity of the main force in this movie. Amazing movie I will likely see again.
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining! We will likely buy the movie when it comes out. The story line was good. It was fun to see in theaters with my 7 and 5 year old kids.
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Clean and funny. Had good lessons in it
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is the perfect sequel to the first movie whilst also tieing into the continuation of the shreck franchise. Amazing story, beautiful amination and very well developed and interesting characters voiced by exremely skilled actors. I can't wait to see where they go with the next movie."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love the movie, it was funny and cute"
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome Movie love it
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,My grandkids and I loved the movie!
"Jan 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This was fun. Not as many laughs as I had expected or hoped for, but some nice performances. I esp. enjoyed Banders, Hayek, Guillen was awesome as Perrito, my girl Florence Pugh as Goldilocks, and those wonderful bears- Colman, Winstone, and Kayo. I may like Mulaney better as a voice actor than a standup. 
The art direction, production design, and visual effects for the animation were fantastic. Spectacular color schemes, esp. with the great idea of the different reaction of the map depending on who touched it. Cool story by the writing team and nice job by director Joel Crawford and Juan Mercado. 3 stars"
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie, hated the weather - not the movies fault."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie loved the art style. Great comedy for kids and adults. Totally worth seeing if you haven’t yet.

"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Great storytelling. Cute characters! A movie the whole family will love.
"Jan 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Some lines are interesting. The story is like an adventure game, and the characters and the technology are not bad. 
Even the bad guy Jeff is the worst and flattest character portrayed in the movie, he said he had died inside that made him not so boring."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,The acting is amazing and the Antagonist is written really well
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,We liked Goldie and perrito!
"Jan 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good funny moments and a good message 
Some  parts were a little too scary for a 6 years old"

"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,This was such a cute movie!
"Jan 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,Voices were great.  Story was so so.
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Gorgeous animation and great story
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"An all around amazing experience, right up there with Shrek 2 as Dreamwork's absolute best. 

The way this movie perfectly blends its mature themes with comedy without allowing them to intrude on one another is simply masterful and the performances from the entire cast are absolutely amazing. The animation very clearly also takes quite a large amount of inspiration from Spiderverse in all the right ways, with the fight scenes especially looking absolutely superb, an absolute must watch."
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,fun movie for all ages.  definitely worth checking out.
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything of the movie was great😄
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very fun movie that has animation that is pleasing, loving the animation style for sure! Good laughs and emotional moments"
"Jan 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,Too much fighting and implied bad language for little kids
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the greatest kids animated movies ever.
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! Antonio Banderas never gets old! The new nursery rhyme references are great - makes me wonder if kids now know who Mother Goose and the assorted cast of characters in her book are so they will get the humor. I hope so. I might not take a 5 year old because of the death character. Not enough context for them to understand. But for older peeps, it's funny and is a great feel good movie"
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such a fun movie, literally for adults and kids. The humor is top tier and the action scenes go harder than I expected.  Even the vulnerable and dark moments were handled in a way that anyone could understand without even trying. A must see and definitely a must watch again for those that have the opportunity to."
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies i have ever saw, beautiful animation, great story andreally good villains."
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lots of fun, and with a good message, too."
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great, touching film about family, friendship and love"

"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"So funny, had our whole family cracking up"
"Jan 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good use of characters but not a big fan of the animation style
"Jan 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was horrible, slow, boring and all of the above. From beginning to end, this movie felt like a drag. My kids were so uninterested. Several other kids in the theatre could not sit still because this movie could not keep their attention. What"
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"It had some charm, adult humor and was cute over all"
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Made me feel, made me happy. I can't recommend enough!"
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Super cute movie. Lots of laughs for the kids but adults as well. Will definitely watch again.
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Words can't describe… I'm actually stun locked. Drop everything and please go see.

"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good movie! I like the different animation methods they used and Death is a great villain!
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the animation during the fight scenes.
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Thought it was a great movie. Different stories with their own different motives which doesn't feel forced, characters are good without making them overbearing or annoying and the scenes and atmosphere hits the spots. Though be warned as it has some scary scenes, not like horror movies of scary, but a bit frightening so would recommend to watch it as a family if there are small kids present otherwise ignore that part. definitely watch it and would recommend it again"
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,The wolf was too scary when he whistled and his creepy eyes. The story line was cute and the dog we liked his part of the story.
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than Avatar 2!!!
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic!!!! Couldn't recommend more.
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie! My kids and I absolutely loved it ❤️
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think it is one of the best movies of 2022, the story progresses in a nice and entertaining way with a plot, characters and animation that catch you from the first minute"
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't even have kids but I still went to watch it
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Puss In Boots: The Last Wish is an absolute masterpiece! Never before have I ever been compelled to review a movie before, but this film was so good that I just had praise it! People need to go see it in theaters so that it succeeds in the box office. DreamWorks NEEDS to make more films like this one!

Spoilers below!

First off, the animation is stunning. It's stylized, similar to Spiderverse but with it's own flair. It has a very pastel like feel to it which greatly compliments the fairy tale theme.
The action is top notch! They purposely lower the frame rate during high action scenes. It helps to exaggerate the look of fast motion, and let's you feel the weight of blow. The choreography is great! The very first fight scene is very reminiscent of Levi fighting the titan on the rooftops in Attack On Titan, and the action only gets better from there.
This movie has not a single bad character somehow! Even the dog, who you'd think would be annoying, ended up being genuinely heartwarming and has funny moments. Never during the film was I disappointed to cut away to a different character because they were all good and all had an appropriate amount of screen time. The character arcs were compelling, the villains were incredible- I'll get back to the villains- not a single second of this film was spent on a character that brought down the experience.
This film has a lot of villains. You would think that with that many villains to juggle, the film would miss the mark, but no. It all balances out quite nicely! And they're all distinctly different from each other! Jack Horner is a hilariously irredeemable crime boss, Goldilocks and the three bears have a genuinely heartwarming message, and the wolf is by far the best animated villain I have ever seen! Maybe even the best villain period! If you have small children, this might not be a good film for them because the wolf is scary. And I don't mean that metaphorically, poetically, rhetorically, theoretically or any of that. I mean he is straight up scary.
This movie's themes about death and making the best of the time you have left on this Earth is handled really, really well and maturely. It has Puss having to come to grips that one day, he will die. Now that he's on his last life (since cats have nine lives), he has the fear death in him. Seeing him grow and realize that death comes for us all, and accepting that feels like a major and well deserved accomplishment.
While I absolutely adore this film, there are a couple cautionary warnings that I feel I have to express about this movie. While it is advertised for kids, it has a lot of darker themes, suggested swearing, morbid humor, and an intense villain that parents may not want to expose their younger children to. That said, if you think you're child is old or mature enough to handle some somewhat more intense themes and action, then this is a movie that both the parents and the kids will enjoy.
10/10 stars, go watch this movie!"
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely fantastic! Best animated movie of the year by far! Even though it's a PG movie, it doesn't baby the audience at all and there are some real and heart touching themes that all ages can relate to and get behind. It is also absolutely hilarious! 

Every character is extremely well written for the roles they play in the film and the main antagonist is a new top tier Dreamworks villain. The stylization of the art and animation is fantastic as well! The best movie from the Shrek Universe since Shrek 2 in my opinion. Overall a great movie!"
"Jan 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not a bad movie. but zero humor.  if you are expecting to laugh like you did for Shrek, you will be disappointed.  storyline felt a bit forced.   the animation is very CGI ish, not the natural animation I prefer.  the lack of humor is my main complaint."
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,The theater has amazing screens and the movie was so cute and funny!! Just loved it !!!
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie to watch with the kids
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Nice family friendly movie the children and parents can enjoy together. Fun story lines which everyone could follow too.
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it, I have a mid expectation for this movie, but instead I get a pure treats.

They're taking more liberties in animation and color styles in this sequel, one of the new thing I realized is they lowered the frame rate and exaggerated the animations during the action scene which makes it more cartoony but enjoyable.

The less desired things are the plot is a bit too predictable, offering not much surprises, and the film run time is too short to my liking.

Still overall, loved it."
"Jan 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,First half was like mediocre film good for children but the second half was very very good. Animation is beautiful and consistent throughout.
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Had low expectations....but Puss delivered. Again! The storyline was fresh a quick moving and the new characters were awesome. Especially the wolf and associated animation was really excellent. Movies in theatre are alive and well...hopefully making a comeback!
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story and nice mixture of animation styles
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny and entertaining!
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"fun. interesting. music song by Karol G, very sexy and amazing vocal makes be fun."
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is legit good I feel like haven't experienced a movie this calm in a while bunch of movies over extending the plot etc. this movie just feels like the perfect amount good for the kids adults etc it's honestly a movie I'm hoping can be continued. It's a movie that I would rewatch and find new interesting touches and would t get bored of it until I've milked it 10/10
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Cinematic masterpiece!
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was the best animated movie of the entire year of 2022. I am a movie critic and I own a movie theater. I have seen almost every animated movie in 2022 and this was amazing. The animation was amazing. The story-line was perfect. I feel any kid of any age will enjoy this movie. Even I, myself, enjoyed it."
"Jan 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The animations, colors, and voices are fantastic but this is not a movie for children.
No wonder we have a world that is all f****d up if this is what we feed our children and young adult. No surprise that three young teenage left the movie a third into it, there is hope."
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This film was surprisingly fun! Worth a watch!

Lobo  was outstanding..animation was fabulous.  Bit of romance bit of drama.."

"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the animation style used in this movie and the cartoonish feel. It adds a lot of character which is better than the hyper-realistic 2011 CGI films. While I still enjoy the first movie's plot, this one was great and had a good plot. Death the wolf was excellent and sent chills down my spine every time I heard his whistle."
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie for the whole family , very warm feeling message"
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"HOLY F@&K! That movie was amazing. The animation and art direction is crisp and beautiful, the story and themes were really well put together, the characters, old and new, are showstoppers, and the Wolf is AMAZING!!!"

"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I took my 6 year old, and it was a hit! We both loved it! Super cute movie! (:"
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie which builds on the characters' very strong roots established in the first film and the protagonist's appearances in the shrek franchise. Enjoyable main plot with b-plots tieing in smoothly with the films overall message of acceptance. A solid watch with friends and family.
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, funny and hilarious for the family to enjoy!"
"Jan 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Pues in boots was a huge NO for us
It was too fast paced and not kid friendly at all and it was very dark.."
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"The animation is crazy good, the story is light-hearted, and the voice acting is very well done! Had a blast watching this movie"
"Jan 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great movie for adults but its advertised as a childrens movie. There should be NO swearing, actual or implied in any type of childrens entertainment. It has a dark storyline, spoiler alert: a death character chasing Puss N Boots. Not for the younger set, theyre not ready for this."
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was really cute and entertaining. It was funny, packed with action and taught life lessons."
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,It had us involved in the plot 100% of the time 10 out of 10
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the best DreamWorks movie in a while.
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was probably the greatest animated film in the last 50 years of cinema. I was laughing, crying, (but mostly laughing) and on the edge of my seat the entire time!"
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,It waxs wonderful movie. The seats are so comfortable and the staff is welcoming and friendly
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun for all - lots of humor and entertaining for all ages.  Also has deeper meaning and  Antonio Banderas!!  Loved it.

"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movie for kids and parents
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Great message!! Love it
"Jan 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,My 6 yr old thought the wolf was too scary. Most of my family didnt like the Little Jack Horner character. My 6 yr old walked out half way through and said he just couldnt watch anymore because of the wolf so I missed the 2nd half.
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything great movie
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,The animation was more anime then what the rest of the other movies are like I prefer how the other ones are in that sense but great movie and great storyline
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"4 adults watched this moved and totally enjoyed our experience! Personally I would not take a young child, but it was a fun movie with cute characters and voices!"
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a feel good movie!!!! Love you Perrito 🥹❤️❤️❤️❤️

"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie got my heart beating faster than avatar the way of the water
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a great movie! Would definitely watch it again!!
"Jan 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Use of the word ""hell"" and having to ""bleep"" words. This is a kids moving and that stuff does not need to be in there!"
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a comeback for the franchise since the fourth film of Sherk. Great Animation unlike DISNEY, the dog could have been annoying but he was the funny one. Actions was great even with the animation, it made it even funnier to watch. Highly recommended"
"Jan 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A little over the head of younger viewers, plenty for the adults to enjoy.  Good lesson about the most special gift:  Friends and Family."
"Jan 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Dark for a kids movie, took my nephews and kid and none of them really liked it. I personally found the 1st Puss in boots way better. There is cursing...not cool, not a kids movie really. I wish I could get a refund 😪"
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was fantastic. Hits all the right notes for parents who grew up with the Shrek franchise and delighted my 5 year old with all the typical Dreamworks charm. Best of all the story is very compelling and has a great message for kids and adults alike. It's a must see!
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,Very much enjoyable and I liked the animation style that was quite unique.
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"The DreamWorks delivers yet again, I never expected to tear up during a Puss in Boots movie but here we are."

"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've seen most of the young peoples' movies. Recently after seeing a Strange World; I wondered if there was going to be any quality movies to take my grandkids too.

Puss and Boots was a wonderful and exciting movie.. I simply enjoyed the movie and recommend to anyone who wants a couple of fun hours with their gang.

Best family movie of 2022."

"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Haven’t laughed this hard in a long time 
"Jan 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was ok. The 3D part wasnt very 3D
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny movie for both kids and adults.
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,The message of the story is one of the best Disney has come up with in a long time. A movie for everyone.
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was all heart. DreamWorks kept it fresh again. They bring in new characters and challenge old ideas of story and cliche. It was very entertaining and I felt that I cared about the characters and their development. Makes me look forward to the next or Shrek 5. The animation and character design was very forward and sharp. 10/10
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent and refreshing
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,almost perfect in every way. fun funny and heartfelt a must see for kids
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies i ever seen, my daughter loves it."
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a great movie that entertained our entire family. I highly recommend this film.
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Aw avatar and this movie and can say with 100% certainty this is not only a better family movie but just simply a better movie hands down. Great characters, great plot, great pacing , great lesson and just a fun time. Highly recommend"
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I watched the movie 2 times. Not only beacouse I think puss in boots the last wish is not only BETTER than Shrek 2 not only BETTTER than any dreamworks movie but one of my top 3 animated movies and one of top 10 movies in general. I also wanted to go second time to support dreamworks which is extremely underrated and my favourite animation studio. I think It's the best animated movie since like Idk more than 10 years. Definitely recomend watching I'm in love with this movie currently and I don't think 5 start is enough beacouse It's a 11/10 movie. BUT there is a problem with this movie. It's too short I mean It was perfect for what it is but If it was like 2h It would be my favourite animated movie ever and the top 3 are practically the same at ranking. so If it was longer It would be a perfect movie
"Jan 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,The animation quality was superb. Great attention to details. However the story was just average. Nothing stood out. My favorite character had to be Perrito I wanted him to come home with me.
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,The previews looked good but the movie was awesome. Well rounded movie that has everything a movie should have. Highly recommend this movie!
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was a 10/10 for me, th animation was exellent, the wolf was a perfect and antagonist. I loved to see kitty return and i liked perito to. The fact shrek 5 was probably teased make me hyped.
Dreamworks never disapoint"
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Took my kids, and I had never seen any of the previous ""Puss in Boots"" movies or show. My daughter saw everything prior and my son only knew of Puss from the Shrek movie. This was one of those movies that was still fun for parents to watch. They do say ""Hell"" and insinuate other swear words like ""Bull shhhhhh,"" if that matters to you, but it went over my kid's heads.  It starts out a little slow, but by the end of the movie, I was anxiously waiting to find out what was going to happen!  This movie was a refreshing one because it wasn't painful for parents to have to sit through!"
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"HOLY MOLY THIS WAS A BEAUTIFUL MOVIE
Theres so much to say about Puss in Boots 2; the visuals were amazing; the choppy animation that kicked in whenever a battle started made the movie even cooler; THE STORY was absolutely brilliant, Death being the villain Puss is running away from; the cinematography on many of the frames were spectacular, everything about the movie was beautiful. Especially the scene where Puss has a panic attack due to Death chasing after him and Perrito comforting him, I don't know why but I felt like I was gonna cry because it was such raw and realistic representation of anxiety disorders and panic attacks, as a person who suffers from GAD. Every character was so interesting and I never felt like their presence onscreen was a waste of time. This is one of the best modern movies coming from Dreamworks, and should I say one of the best animated films that came out this year, probably even better than GDT's Pinnochio (which I'm also a big fan of). PLEASE WATCH THIS MOVIE ITS SO GOOD I SWEAR"
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,We enjoyed it. 3 1/2 said parts were scary but he sat and watched it all
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. Well developed character arcs created an exciting story, not just for the main feline hero but his fellow partners. The art style for the animation was well used and made the entire story feel like a moving storybook! Fantastic film, best in the series!"
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,it totally enthralled my granddaughter
"Jan 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,Awful. Not for kids.
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,M A S T E R P I E C E
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a movie!! Where should I start? It tells a story of an arrogant, selfish adventurer, whose ego and carelessness led to him burning through 8 of his 9 lives, then going on a quest to get them back, and along the way, learns that he doesn't have to be the Legend, always alone, always being self-centered and egotistical. Puss goes on a journey to the Wishing Star, which will grant one wish to whoever gets to it first. He is joined by Perrito, a dog who, despite being treated like crap all of his life, is very upbeat and happy, and just a little too trusting for his own good, and he meets back up with Kitty Softpaws, his old flame, with some understandable trust issues. But they are not alone in the search for the Wishing Star, because there are 3 main baddies after our feline hero. First is Little Jack Horner, or rather Big Jack Horner, a giant psychopath bent on getting all the magic in the world. Next is Goldielocks and the Three Bears Crime Family, a smash-and-grab operation and a real family, as they took Goldie in and made her a part of their family. And finally, no fairy tale would be complete without Wolf, who may be more than just a bounty hunter. The movie is good, it's really good, it's really incredibly really good. The character development has really advanced in this movie, the story has some serious messages while also having lighthearted moments. They even swear in the movie(Don't worry, the really bad ones are bleeped out{Yes, the bleep sound effect is in the movie!) After 11 years, the Legend has returned. He's back, and better than ever. The character arcs are beautiful, with Puss, Kitty, and Perrito all going through noticeable changes throughout the entire movie. And there is a sub-plot with Goldie and the Bears, and Kitty too, involving themes of family and trust respectively. The movie doesn't dumb down the themes, not laying them out like a Thanksgiving banquet. It shows the themes, instead of telling them. Big Jack Horner was a genuinely funny villain, and even though he didn't have his own character arc, he was no less of a villain than the others. Over, the movie is exceptionally-great, with amazing animation, fun and complex, the stories are very compelling, with themes that are shown instead of told, like fear of death, appreciating your life, what family really means."
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing Cartoon painting style and my nostalgia the films is capturing every things from story line ,Characteristic ,Unigue adventures ,animation ,purpose of enemy ,drama ,and humors
and the most i love it is the Wolf (Death) that stalking and Haunt puss then the Whisper is the iconic of wolf amazing movie great job Dream works"
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is literally perfect: every character is entertaining and the animation is gorgeous.
"Jan 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible movie. I don't know who the target audience was. Not appropriate for kids, dumb for the adults."
"Jan 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,Boring and too many special effects for a kids movie
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I really love this movie. The animation was amazing. The characters were amazing.
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Best animated movie in 2022, or 2023!"
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it and so did my grandkids very entertaining good storyline and Puss was as charming as ever
"Jan 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,The dizzy drawcard of animation mesh up just doesn't sit well with the lovable main character. And the movie is far too violent for younger viewers. A few laughs and well timed bleeps could not save this movie from being one step away from a white hot mess.
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, animation, music. Perfect all around."
"Jan 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very violent and nightmarish. Dont take young kids to see.
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"The kids really enjoyed it.  However, our 9 year old daughter found the bad wolf too frightening."
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"OMG I LOVE, AAAH AAAH MY INNER CHILD IS TOO HAPPY, MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF THIS YEAR 100%"
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"the stakes have never felt higher for puss when death is whistling nearby, raising the hair on his back and mine 👀 genuinely surprised by everything this movie offered including the action bits that absolutely ripped"
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie and 3d was awesome
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, took my daughter and we genuinely laughed multiple times, I recommend."
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny. Kids loved it.
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie with a great storyline and alot of action. Maybe too much action. Some of it frightened my grandson  .
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,good story shows you don't need a wish
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,funny and the animation was great
"Jan 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Violence from beginning to end.  Wolf
Character way to scary for young children.  Plus plot for movie was also too deep for young kids.  Story was jumping all over the place.  But mostly, to intense scary for Young kids.  Just awful."
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the most fun I've had with a movie in a while. The animation and style of this movie is beautiful and the action is fun and exciting. The story is about overcoming fear and mortality. They discuss these themes well which is quite special for a movie catered to kids. One of the characters is pretty basic and annoying but gets a bit better. They could've done more with this character keeping this movie from having a perfect rating for me. I would definitely watch it again soon though.
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Ita great movie. Visuals were very outstanding and sophisticated and the plot was chefs kiss!
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Funny and a good lesson/moral
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"literally the best animated movie I saw all year, probably my top 3 of all time."

"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,It has a great story line.
"Jan 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just didnt like the movie
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great family friendly movie with great themes without ""the message."""
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"One of the best kids movies I’ve ever seen! The animation was awesome and is a movie with an incredible storyline, must see for any age!"
"Jan 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The first 45 minutes will be boring to anyone over 8 years old.  The movie picks up after that.  Overall, definitely not as good as Shrek 1 or Shrek 2.  In particular, the animation is worse than the animation used in the Shrek movies."
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is fun and very funny.
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,story line was super cute . we loved the dog. the ending was great
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,By far the best animated movie I've seen in awhile I can't wait to see the next movie in the Shrek universe if it will be more like this one.
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing, please go see it"
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story! Creative, clever, held the attention of my 60 year old girlfriend"
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"the film is fascinating, the visual aspects such as the soundtrack are impeccable, the story is not that complex, but if it leaves you thinking after the film and also leaves not one, if not many reflections to make about the characters, without a doubt Dreamworks did a perfect job in this new film.
this is an honest recommendation, totally worth it!"
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely a great true sequel to the Puss n Boots series! A must watch for the whole family!
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Very fun movie that leaves a nice feeling in your heart.
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Justo como debe de ser una película animada , entretenida y que te haga pasar un buen rato , probablemente la mejor animación del 2022 que a salido en cines"
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"-Language and/or bleeps

+Unique story
+Nostalgic characters"
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun, fast and family friendly.   love Puss in Boots.."
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,entire family loved it!
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was really good. Los of cuteness, comedy, and action.  A great film for the entire family."
"Jan 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie was great! However, there were parts that I did not understand or not complete for me. But in all the movie was pretty good."
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie for our 4 year old granddaughter and some laugh out loud moments for us too.
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,It was good and funny a good movie for kids
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,Absoutly a wonderful movie for the children. My 5 year great-granddaughter would understand the whole movie.
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"We love cats, so this movie was super cute and fun! 
Loved the stories behinds from previous movies!!"
"Dec 31, 2022",NEUTRAL,Disappointing....language more adult than children.
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,Very funny great movie
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,I loved it! Great animation with a lot of heart. It was fun how they worked the other fairy tale characters into the story.
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,very cute movie for the whole family.
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,Good loving for a family outing. Solid jokes and writing plus some really good fight scenes and action sequences.
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,I'm in my 50s and I really enjoyed this movie. I haven't laughed as much in a theatre in a long time. Worth seeing.
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,Best DreamWorks movie in years
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"Easy to watch, funny, and entertaining."
"Dec 31, 2022",NEUTRAL,Cute movie for the whole family!
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great animation, great story, great characters, surprised how good it is."
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,It's been a long time since I've laughed so hard and out loud at the movies. Very cleverly written riffing off of several fairy tales and nursery rhymes. I seriously doubt the grade schoolers and pre-teens that were there caught even a fraction of the jokes that us adults winked and nodded at.
"Dec 31, 2022",NEUTRAL,I liked the puppy.  It was cute.
"Dec 31, 2022",NEGATIVE,I went for the popcorn. The CGI is interesting from an art perspective. They used a cool technique during the fight scenes. The runtime is 1:40 and it's about 1:20 too long. Goldilocks and Big Jack are the most interesting characters. the story starts slow and didn't hold my interest after a 1/2 hour. kids will probably like it.
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"Way better than the first installement of the franchise. I loved the pacing as well as the villain, which absolutely terrified me, even though this is a kids movie. I loved this movie so much I might want to watch it again in theaters."
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"The animation's top notch, the story engrossing and gripping as Puss struggles with his first true fear of Death, it really feels like a love letter to all the kind of fun adventure stories Puss in Boots represents, and the enjoyable fairy tale fun of the Shrek franchise in general. I just had a truly great time."
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"Antonio Banderas has a hot voice, this movie made me cry, and the art and animation are outstanding. What else can I say?"
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,It was a funny and action packed story that emphasized the importance of relationships and family. We all loved this iteration of Puss in Boots!
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,Cute movie. Could have gone without a few choice words for a kids movie.
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,Another good film from DreamWorks! My kid loved it and I wasn't bored!
"Dec 31, 2022",NEUTRAL,"The animation was cool, singing was fun. It wasn’t as funny as Shrek 1 and 2 though. For it being a kids movie it’s pretty decent for an adult."
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,Good movie I like it and my son loved it
"Dec 31, 2022",NEGATIVE,It was a lot darker content than in previous movies.
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"very cute movie storyline, animation, was great. not a dull moment throughout"
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,The whole movie was great. I was able to take my grandchildren with no worries.
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"Very good movie to watch with family. Watched with children in the cinema, they are delighted"
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,The movie theater I went to was Flix Brewhouse and they overcharged us for our popcorn they charged us for two you couldn't hear anything they said the movie was great but the service being overcharged is not something you want to have happen at a movie theater

"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"This is truly one of the best movies to come out this year, and that's not only in the animation category let me tell you. This movie does an excellent job at developing and maturing Puss into a character I would love to see again soon along with the supporting cast (re)introduced in this film. The villain has to be one of the best dreamworks have ever done where they might send a chill down your spine everytime they appear on screen. The action, animation, dialogue, story and characters all go so amazingly well together that I cannot express it enough. This movie is all I have thought about the past day after seeing it and just cause of that I might go see it again due to it being so amazing. In the movie it covers deep subjects and ideas kids may not understand to the fullest like with anxiety, death, and growing up or maturing fully, but of course it is a family movie in the end and it needs to be seen!"
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,Entertaining great story for youngsters

"Dec 31, 2022",NEGATIVE,Very depressing. Was hoping for a light hearted movie with some hope and happiness to see with my my parent as she deals with a medical issues and this was just terrible. We don't go out much to the movies and had to walk out. Why would they even make this? I don't recommend seeing it.

"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"I have never viewed a movie that has made me feel like a kid quiet like this. This made me cry, feel joy, and laugh like I haven’t in a while. 11/10 please see this movie!!?!?!!&"
"Dec 31, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Too loud, too violent.  Not much of a story line.  Very disappointed."
"Dec 31, 2022",NEUTRAL,Typical animation.. poor story lineno imaginationself ingratiating to Latino culture.  You can do better with Guardians of the Galaxy.
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"In my perspective, it is a film with a very good plot, recommended without a doubt for children, lovers of this type of animation different from the usual, taking certain films as a reference, and for lovers of Sherk, although that is not possible. the pair of Sherk 1 or 2."

"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"This movie is one of the best animated movies I've seen since spider verse. This is one of the greatest movies ever to come out in 2022. The voice acting the visuals it all comes together to create a masterpiece. The dark and depressing tone that can become all colorful, sweet and vibrant is perfect. The music when Death comes on screen with his whistling is spine chilling. This makes the movie great for 10 and older audiences but I think younger kids need to watch this. We need more stuff like this movie."
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,Engaging and creative !!
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,It was funny and entertaining.  Good family movie.
"Dec 31, 2022",NEGATIVE,Not funny…cute…not sure why the reviews are so high…definitely a movie that can wait for home or be missed altogether

"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"I thought this movie was going to be child like but the whole concept of the movie was death, which in my opinion was so great! It also made me cry a little. If you're an adult you should def still see this super enjoyable. Puts things into perspective for you!"
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,yes very good very fresh and juicy

"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"Absolutely amazing movie. One of the best I have seen in the last years. The scary scenes are very well done and show what a realistic anxiety attack looks like. As the viewer I felt really immersed in the movie. The comedy is nice, the animation is gorgeous and the action scenes are freaking cool. A movie that kids and adults can enjoy."
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great movie. Kids were laughing, parents were laughing, everyone enjoyed the movie."
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,Great movie. 3D format was outstanding. So would the standard format also. Kept you on your toes and kept interest peeking.
"Dec 30, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Being a fan of the ""Shrek"" franchise, I could not pass up the newest entry.  While ""Puss in Boots:  The Last Wish"" does have its problems, it is still a very well made and entertaining movie.  Antonio Banderas is perfect as the voice of the title character.  Salma Hayek is terrific also as the voice of Kitty Softpaws.  The supporting characters are clever and well done.  The character of Perrito (voiced by Harvey Guillen.) is also a welcome addition to the long list of comic sidekicks we see in these types of movies.  One other highlight is the character of Death (Voiced by Wagner Moura.).  The writers on this movie handeled the character very well.  The resolution with the character was quite good.  My only criticism of the movie is its rather formulaic storyline.  In the beginning of the movie, Puss only thinks of himself and could not care less about anybody else.  However in time he comes to realize his selfishness is wrong and he needs to change his attitudes towards others.  Nothing we have not seen before.  However this minor flaw is made up for by a well done climactic fight sequence.  It has just the right amount of thrills and does not become too drawn out or overblown.  Over two decades after ""Shrek"" Dreamworks is still able to keep the franchise going with some good entertainment.  If you are a Shrek fan as I am I think you would like ""Puss in Boots:  The Last Wish""."
"Dec 30, 2022",NEGATIVE,This movie is not for young kids.
"Dec 30, 2022",NEUTRAL,Too much violence for kids.
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great family movie. My kids ages range between 12 and 6 and they all loved it! Everyone had a favorite part. My favorite character is Perrito, the dog. Too funny and cute!"
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,It was a cute movie. Very entertaining with some adult humor to keep us interested. Would recommend to those who follow the Shrek movies.
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"The movie packs a load of really heart tugging messages in its just shy of 2 hour run time.  Many of the young children will probably not sense the messages but that is OK because the action scenes and storyline will keep them entertained.  As for the adults, you will find yourself reflecting on quite a few of those messages.  The combination of comedy and action are evenly dispersed.  I highly recommend this delightful film for all ages."
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,great movie!! loved it for kids.
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"Fast paced, lots of comedy, and surprises. A good feel family movie and no vulgar language!"
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"I saw this with my daughter and I had no idea what it was really about. I love the Shrek franchise and all of its spinoffs. This move it stellar. 5/5. Even if you're an adult, it's very good. The humor is a great mix of adult and child alike and even the childlike jokes were constructed well enough not to be cheap. I would highly recommend this to anyone, and I've already done just that to my friends."
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"Lloré me hizo reflexionar sobre mi vida y a que aprenda a valorarla, amé la película"
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,Is very funny and very interesting
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great movie can be enjoyed by any age. Good plot, interesting storyline, and a whole lot of cuteness"
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"Went to see this with my husband who isn't too keen on animated films. Needless to say I enjoyed it very much, but surprisingly so did he. Puss in Boots 2 is marvelous in terms of animation, anyone with eyes and a bit of creativity could've seen that; however, the story and characters really sink in just how much love and effort was put into this film. Puss is the perfect depiction of growing out of who you once were into something better, coming to terms with the fact that you need to cherish the one life you have with the ones you love. The pacing is just right with only one moment in the beginning feeling just a tad bit drawn out. Overall we had a lot of fun watching this film and finding our own ways to connect with the different characters in the film. I highly recommend this movie to everyone and we will definitely be watching it again"
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,An amazing masterpiece of a movie. But I think it lacked nods to the first one.
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"Not always a huge fan of animated films HOWEVER I took my grandkids....5, 8 and 12 and we all absolutely loved this film.   It's funny....really funny. Heartwarming....loved the animation and especially loved Puss and Boots and his precious little dog friend.  Well made....even for adults"
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,My daughter and I loved the movie.
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"Lovely movie, amazing animation style which resembles Spiderman Into the Spiderverse while keeping true to the Shrek fantasy world. Great fight scenes and lovely for all ages."
"Dec 30, 2022",NEUTRAL,Disliked swear words and bleeping of swear words.  Not good for intended audience. Granddaughter says it was funny.  She like the characters in the story.
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,I brought 2 11-year olds and we really enjoyed it.  It was a very good story!
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,Awesome just awesome
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,I loved how my grandsons figured it out and laughed.
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,I Love It  It Was So Good
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is as spry and light on its feet as its titular feline. The inherently alluring paradox of the swashbuckling kitty from the ""Shrek"" universe remains firmly in place 11 years after his first solo feature. He's a dashing adventurer, a charmer with the ladies, feared and renowned throughout the land -- but he's also unbearably adorable as he laps up milk from a shot glass with his pinky, sandpapery tongue. As always, the charismatic and sensitive Antonio Banderas finds just the right tone in exploring this furry animated figure's suave and silly sides. ""The Last Wish"" expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the Oscar-nominated 2011 original ""Puss in Boots."" Joining Banderas and his longtime friend and co-star Salma Hayek Pinault are Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and John Mulaney, among many others. They bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor. But of course, the fast-paced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director Joel Crawford and co-director Januel Mercado's film. The film's aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences, especially during the action sequences, but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight. From the moss growing on a fearsome forest giant to the shiny silkiness of Puss' whiskers blowing in the wind, ""The Last Wish"" offers a variety of eye-popping details. And it frequently features dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves to transition from past to present or one scene to the next. But the film also manages to convey messages of selflessness and teamwork in a way that doesn't feel heavy-handed or cloying. And the stellar voice performances and dazzling visuals keep things so engaging you won't need a laser pointer or a catnip-stuffed mouse toy to entertain you."
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"I thought it was very entertaining for adults and kids
Some learning experiences were included 
Very cute and enjoyable movie"
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,Loved the adult humor!
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie. Amazing fight scenes and amazing characters
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,IT IS THE BEST DREAMWORKS MOVIE! IT'S SO GOOD THAT I DON'T HAVE ANY WORDS TO SAY ABOUT IT. IT'S JUST PERFECT.
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,Loved the animation and voice acting. I also were so happy because of the Shrek references. Bring us the  Shrek 5
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,yo this movie is kinda funny and cool
"Dec 30, 2022",NEUTRAL,"A well-made film and nice to watch - just, it's not quite funny at all. This is very disappointing for a film in the tradition of Shrek."
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"Fun, imaginative and surprisingly thoughtful story.  Character development and pacing are really well covered. Highly recommended!"
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,So good! Laughter and tears with this one! #teamfriendship
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"So much fun! Beautiful animation work, need more movies like this! You can tell how much time went into it. Lovely story for people of all ages too."
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,The movie entertained with cleverness and wit while instilling true values and life lessons.
"Dec 30, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Nice effects ... to much action with no meaning . First movie was far superior in everyday, especially the story . This movie was forgettable ...  wait for it on your streaming service"
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"Overall, while I can't say I had loads of laugh-out-loud moments in this film like I enjoyed in the previous instalment or the Shrek Franchises, I'm proud to say I found this sequel went deeper, darker, and more adventurous than expected. Fans will see the adorable Puss at his worst but also at his strongest, which I loved experiencing on the big screen. Voice work is a knock-out, and the animation style feels like a classic fairy tale book coming to life for most of the duration, which is a nice, magical touch. Some younger audiences might be a little frightened by some dark tones. This animated film strikes strongly and positively like a fresh glass of cool milk."
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,Fun movie for kids and adults!
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"Oh. My. God. This movie is absolutely stunning!
The animation, the acting , the character development; friendship with Shen has ended. [Spoiler] is now my best friend.

This movie is a must-see! In my opinion, it rivals that of Shrek. Fucking. T w o."
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"Loved the animation and the sorely was different them the prior movies. Lots of funny parts, and not only kid friendly, but also adult friendly"
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,Very entertaining movie.  Not very long and good amount of action and humor.
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,On impulse I started to applaud at the start of the end credits. The 3/4 full house at a 3:30 Thursday matinee in downtown Seattle heartily joined in. Suffice to say this film is a crowd pleaser.
"Dec 30, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Such a dark movie. If I had little kids with me it would scare them.  Expected a light hearted, funny movie which I didn't get. Actually left the movie when the dog described how he was put in a sack with a rock and thrown in water."
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,I liked the movies meaning thought it was a little loud
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,Fast moving and entertaining especially for our grandchildren age 6 and 8
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,It was so good nothing will compare to the original but it was laughter the whole movie and it had moments that tugged on your heart strings. So much action will have you screaming holy frijoles!
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,loved seeing the Cat in action again!
"Dec 30, 2022",NEGATIVE,"To be fair, the animation was great and there was some moments that made me laugh and the moral of the story of realizing what you have in front of you was noted.  But it did make me sad to think this is all parents have to choose from when taking little kids to the theater.  The scale of scariness and dark characters tipped over in my opinion for younger viewers and unfortunately, the good moral may be lost in the sea of scariness.  One little girl who is 5 was telling me how scared she was of the wolf and didnt want to see the movie ever again and of blood on the cat.  Its all she could recount from the story line and I guarantee it is a one and done viewing for her - no interest in seeing, renting it or wanting any merchandise from it.  Im glad my kids are grown now.  But, when they were younger, the movies we took them to were ones that inspired them and they found characters they wanted to be like and theyd watch the movie- no joke- 20 times or more!  I wish for those kind of characters again for this next generation of you g kids - not ones that keep them up all night with the lights on"
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,Good story. Very creative!!
"Dec 30, 2022",NEUTRAL,John Mulaney is SO GOOD and SO FUNNY and I would kiss Florence Pugh because she is stunning. Love them both. Animation was weird.
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,Great movie. Entertaining start to finish. 
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,Movie was fantastic and there's a lot of things that go over kids heads that had me dying. lot of cussing in Spanish 😭
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,it's was good 🎬 for family. makes believe in wishing come true
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"I liked the creativity of Puss in Boots in how they weaved fairy tales and rhymes into the story.  I loved the moral story it was telling about the importance of family, friends, and facing our fears and facing death."
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,Antonio and Salma keep the fairy tales alive in this great action comedy!
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,I could see where children would get afraid watching it. The wolf after puss and boots.
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,funny and entertaining
"Dec 30, 2022",NEUTRAL,"The movie overall was fine, typical but to me it is for older children (8-9+). It may be too much for younger children. There are some not so subliminal cursing moments and the death character definitely has some rather scary scenes. And there are moments of strong animation violence."
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"Our family thoroughly enjoyed the creative story/plot and the awesome animation that would subtly change during the action sequences to resemble comic book sequences. Antonio Banderas voice-over acting as Puss was hilarious and spot on, no one else could ever do equal justice. The only thing I was slightly surprised about was how dark some moments were for an animated family film. I have older kids with the youngest aged 8, and he was fine but for some younger kids, some of the imagery may be a little on the  scary side. Still, we enjoyed and would watch again!"
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"that sh*t was funny as frek. Def gonna rewatch,"
"Dec 30, 2022",NEGATIVE,Humorless and boring for adults. Scary for kids.

"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,peak cinema and a must watch

"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"I loved it. It was fast paced and had humor, suspense and just a lil fear to keep the grands entertained."

"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,literally one of my new comfort movies. I loved it so much- especially as a Mexican person who went to go see it with my relatives- it was perfect with the Spanish and English jokes sprinkled throughout the movie. I loved the part where Puss has a panic attack and we see Perrito help him to workout his anxiety- that was so comforting to watch. Great movie for all ages.
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,great kids movie and a fun time for family

"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,The entire movie keeps the kids on the edge of their seat while all the hidden nods to different fairy tales and nursery rhymes keeps adults interested and laughing too. Can't wait to watch it again!
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Characters are amazing.
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Very appropriate for all ages.
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Awesome Movie! The journey puss takes throughout the movie is amazing. The final fight with the Wolf is good as well. Didn't really like Goldi and the 3 bears but I thought the movie was just great. Gonna buy it when it comes to DVD or BluRay. Please just go watch this movie so it makes its money back.
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Very entertaining and suprisingly mature
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Had low expectations going in and it immediately pulled me in with its stunning colorful visuals. Some funny jokes and a enjoyable story.
"Dec 29, 2022",NEGATIVE,"A little too much violence for smaller children. Animation was very good, but story was so-so. Seven year old granddaughter hid head under jacket on some of the more intense scenes. Movie about character Puss and Boots avoiding death. What happened to the feel good animated children's movies?"
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,That wolf gives me chills
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"A perfect story about how death must be faced naturally at the end of everything, making a great villain's appearance for a kids' movie. Everything you could expect of a sequel, and even surpassed any standard you come to meet. A must-see film for every audience!"
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,I expected to get Copper and found Gold. A very enjoyable and at times even emotional movie with a lot of heart put into it. Definitely a must watch for all ages
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Saw this movie with my daughter (4years). 
She and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The story was great which is great to see compared to what is being pushed out recently by Disney. 

The characters were great.
Puss in boots is still classically funny. 
Goldi and her pals are good and Horner was fun to watch. 

However the wolf!!! Amazing!! Such a great character and really set the tone with his entrances. I wish he has a better ending write for him but still fun to watch.  

Overall the family loved it."
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"This has gotta be one of my favorites of all time. The animation style is eye candy, the character models look to be made with care. I love the storyline too."
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,My grandson And I loved it!
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"This was a great movie. We laughed ALOT. However, may have some language parents may not agree with for the really littles."
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,We really enjoyed this movie.  Super cute and funny.
"Dec 29, 2022",NEUTRAL,Hated all the fighting
"Dec 29, 2022",NEGATIVE,"A kids movies that does NOT feel like it is for kids. This movie includes the words cr*p twice and h*ll, as well as two scenes in which words are bleeped out. The wolf in the movie that is chasing Puss in Boots to kill him had red eyes with scary, threatening facial expressions (and carrying sharp sickles) that scared my eight year old. And there was a violent--honestly, he was a psychopath--version of little Jack Horner in it that also terrified my eight year old. Also, it seems to me that time spent on creating an interesting plot was sacrificed for time spent on fighting/violence. I have an eight year old and an eleven year old-- both were bored and both were surprised with the amount of violence and swearing."
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"This movie is making me nostalgia when I watch Sherk 2 and Puss in Boots 1, This animated is have great style to present is look colorful and like a comic, The story has you see inside emotional of Puss, and he have growing with his friend in the journey, I really love everything in movie"
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Fun and fast paced. Kept my interest the whole time. The Shrek series is hit and miss for me, but this one was great!"
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Absolutely Hilarious! If this is start of a new rebooted Shrek franchise then this is a great start for a reboot. Antonio Banderas is perfect for Puss in Boots. 
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Holy flip this movie was AMAZING!!! I love the two different animation styles, and the story. And there's a bunch of different genres like there's a little bit of horror, comedy, adventure, action fantasy, ect. I really liked this movie and I would recommend it for all ages!"
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is a must see for all! I took my five year old twins as well as my twenty three year old daughter to see it, and everyone was engaged throughout the whole movie. It was very funny and endearing, and filled with many components of a great movie!
love it!"
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,My 8 year old son really enjoyed it.  My wife and I thought it was funny too.
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Great animated action for all ages
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,I took my grandkids ages 6 and 8 and they loved it and so did I.
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Puss In Boots : The Last Wish is an unexpected surprise that only provides great animation, solid voice actor but also a deep character study for Puss' character. This film talks about a lot of heavy things such as fear, loneliness, love, family and death, which is something I was not expecting in a Puss In Boots film. This film made it to my top 5 movies of the year and I highly recommend it to everyone!

Just a quick warning though, this movie can be quite scary for the younger audience members and there is one character in particular that can be pretty terrifying for them, so if you're a parent, just keep on the look out for that."
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Animation is very nice and fun to look at. The story is very hilarious because of how dark it can get. The dog side character is surprisingly very charming and funny. Characters are great and not boring whatsoever. The wolf is a great antagonist, and keeps you interested. I highly recommend this movie!!! (I really want this to perform well so we can have dream works movies like this in the future)"
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Muy buena película de animación, la cual sabe aprovechar distintos estilos de animación, a pesar de no ser un estilo nuevo se sabe aprovechar, con escenario llenos de color.
La historia es comprendíble tanto para adultos y niños logrando agradar a toda la audiencia, los personajes tienen un toque comíco y a su vez se logra enfatizar con ellos.
Al final la película tiene un muy buen mensaje tanto para una audiencia adulta como infantil."
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Fun not just for kids, adults too. Wolf is the best character he's really scarry, cool and that whistle..."
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Did not expect to like this sequel as much as I did. The humor and wit expressed throughout the film provide another classic Puss in Boots tale. Great for all ages, definitely a must see."
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Fun, exciting and cute movie for the family."
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Wow! Feels very different from the other Puss films and Shrek. When the actions starts, the characters switch to animating on 2s, and looks more hand-drawn. (like Into the Spider-Verse, which probably influenced it.)"
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"I’m a 23 year old man who can only really be brought to the theater for action and war movies. This movie was one of the best movies I’ve seen in recent memory. Not a single complaint about any part of the movie. Animation was great, story was great, run time was perfect, dialogue was phenomenal, jokes landed even for adults. Go see this movie in theaters for all that is good and holy in this world."
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"A truly touching and breathtakingly beautiful movie. I laughed, I cried, and felt many other emotions. Please watch this movie and support it 10/10"
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Great movie! We enjoyed it so much!
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Epic movie, even with high expectations, it delivered on all front! except, probably the accent of some of the characters"
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,I thought Puss in Boots The Last Wish was a super fun family movie. It even kept my 82 year old mother entertained and she falls asleep during every movie. Hope there will be another one soon
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,The best part about the movie was the dog and the Wolf
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"The movie was entertainingly fun to it it was worth every single smile on my family's faces. The opening scene felt like a real 80s party, where everyone is having a good time...... Too bad the studio waited so long to make a sequel, they might be able to make an origin story to how he became our favorite fearless hero......"
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Great movie for my two young daughters and I. We laughed and paid close attention to how the nursery rhymes fit perfectly into the movie.
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,The Big Bad Wolf = Top 5 Villains
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Fun, engaging story. Excellent animation. Good music, especially during closing credits. Good family experience."
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,So much better than I could have imagined! Language is questionable though.
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Masterpiece! 10 out of 10! 
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Our family loved this movie.   It helps if you have seen the first one.   The characters are even better in this sequel.
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,The art style was absolutely gorgeous. The animation was exciting. The story was heartfelt and meaningful. Yes I'm talking about a Puss in Boots movie. There wasn't a single thing I didn't enjoy about this movie. A must see!
"Dec 29, 2022",NEGATIVE,Dry depressing movie. Subject was death
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Loved the movie and so did my two kids!!! It was so cute and funny
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Best animated movie in years!!!
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Cute movie.  Kept the kids entertained the whole time. Even the 4 year olds
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Loved it, funny and cute"
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Kids thought the movie was great. Filled with jokes.
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Puss in boots, the last wish, had incredible animations fitting music and an amazing storyline. The mix of old and new characters was very refreshing as well."
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,I loved the story and the comedy. It was absolutely hilariously. I especially loved all the characters
"Dec 29, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Horrible, not suitable for kids. The main theme is dark, him running from death. Lots of bad words, even the F bomb bleeped out. Why can’t a kids movie just be innocent and fun. Would never see it again."
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Best Movie OF THE YEAR
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Animation was great and cute story
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Movie was delightful. Antonia banderas was great.
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Its hard to find a family movie with this level of substance. It is the archetypical heros journey with a twist, and something to which parents can relate and kids will love. I especially enjoyed the animation techniques in the fight sequences."
"Dec 29, 2022",NEGATIVE,"This movie was not very pleasant, the crude humour, the corse language and many more inappropriate scenes made the children in the cinema start screaming and crying. This ruined the experience that I wanted. Being a fellow ""Puss in Boot"" fan club member I was offended by the swearing. I don't know if the shirtless man dancing in the cinema was apart of the movie but my wife of 64 years and myself loved his performance. This movie traumatised all the kids in the cinema when Puss died, the way he died was very violent because he got shanked up by   wolf. The movie tickets were not worth the 3.65$ that I payed for, I could of put that money together to by my wife diapers because she is getting old. I hope dreamworld fixes this movie and this is a warning for everyone.

Sincerely 
John Pentavious Mars"
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"My grandchildren enjoyed it.  It was full of action, but appropriate for children."
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Grandkids loved it. I thought it was entertaining
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Puss In Boots: The Last Wish is a lively-animated, fun experience while it tells a story of a more mature theme, keeping a good balance of most of the elements of the movie. The arcs of the characters complement the core theme of the story well. There is a good balance between the funny and serious moments of the movie. Overall, one of the better-animated movies of the year, if not the best."
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"The movie was cute, with a good story line, about appreciating what you have."
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Good movie for everyone, it's about a very important topic that no one dares to talk about especially for an animated movie, go see it visually it's beautiful and impressive /
Buena película para todos, es sobre un tema muy importante que nadie se atreve hablar especialmente para una película animada, vayan a verla visualmente es hermosa e impresionante  10/10"
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Good movie had a great storyline and was funny 
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,My kids loved the movie! They wanted to see it again as soon as it ended!
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,So refreshing to see a movie this good come out of Dreamworks. Hopefully they continue this quality of work in future movies. 
"Dec 29, 2022",NEGATIVE,Too violent & too much darkness & fighting for a cartoon
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"I wasn't expecting this movie to be this good. I liked the first one ok, but I didn't want to go back to see it necessarily and I didn't talk about it much after watching it. But THIS movie....blew the first one way out of the water. The main song is stuck in my head (in a good way), the jokes landed constantly, the emotions came out of nowhere to pull on your heartstrings, then they made you laugh afterwards, you felt the intense action that was happening on screen, and you liked all the new characters and familiar that they introduced. I can't say enough how good this movie is. I definitely wouldn't mind seeing this one again (and I kind of want someone to ask - lol). But yeah, definitely a more-than-solid entry."
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"pleasantly surprised, a must watch for all ages."
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Loved it!  Great lessons learned.
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,It was a clever story and good moral lesson. Burrito stole the show.
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,This was a terrific film - very entertaining.
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,Best animated movie of the year.
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"""This is a fairytale.""

The narrator states, matter-of-factly, in the beginning of the film. And of course you'd think a talking cat in boots fighting giant tree-stone monster while holding a concert is a fairytale, right? 

Because if you think so you're wrong. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a surprisingly deep and relatable story about the meaning of death and of life. 

With a mix-and-mashed version of a few well-known fairytales, the writer showed audiences of all ages some otherwise done-to-death morals, that life is to be cherished, that the real wish is the friends we made along the way, to stop and smell the rose, etc. etc. They are, of course, not the main parts of the story, but they have set a heartwarming ambience to the narrative, and did so successfully, making it insightful even to an adult.

The central piece to the story, then, is Death's overarching pursuit for Puss in Boots. Character, animation, and sound designers reached for the best of the best in making the appearance of Death as horrifying as possible, because to Puss in Boots and possibly most of us, he is. Although he was personified in the film, the way different visual elements worked together still made it easy to interpret the story in a figurative way and read its moral that life is to be cherished.

The film's pace seems somehow rushed, but I don't see it being a bad thing. Fast-paced storytelling does not mean an incoherent narrative, and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish did a nice job in picking up any loose ends before the resolution. If anything, I'd prefer its quick pace of narration over a Hollywood action-adventure-scifi-romcom that has a thousand character arcs and spans over three hours.

All in all, take those morals or not, you're still going to enjoy the occasional jokes, top-tiered graphics design, interlinked story arcs, and finally that part of your childhood, revisited.

"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,It was perfect for kids
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,BEST MOVIE EVER it’s so funny
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"A ver good movie. It's not perfect, but you can tell the people behind it put all their heart making it and the result shows it. I truly recommed it."
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,It was entertaining for adults and a blast for my niece (9) and nephew (7).
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"High interest rate, my nieces and nephews loved the whole movie."
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,Full of action and kept the kiddos entertained
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great time, fun movie for both kids and adults. Not too short and not too long. Has some similar humor to Shrek (not a bad thing). Overall a must see."
"Dec 28, 2022",NEUTRAL,A pleasant movie to see with your young kids or grandkids
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great movie! If you are an older adult, whose kids grew up with Shrek, this will be a treat!"
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,Great movie for family to enjoy!
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,Very funny. Enjoined the new characters and old.
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,An absolute masterpiece of presentation. Good and creative characters. And easily the best Dreamworks villain.
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,My boys (6 & 8) loved all the action!
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"I loved the overall plot, which emphasizes what is important in life.  Also, I enjoyed the references to other works such as Alice in Wonderland and Cinderella. Optimism and friendship were the winners in the movie."
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,The movie was great.
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,Such a great movie to see with kids of all ages!
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,How the characters work together at the end team friendship with one goal in mind which everybody wish came true
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Good graphics, music and good for kids. Loved the 3D"
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,I liked the storyline
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,Best Film of 2022 🥰
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,Beautifully animated with an engaging storyline. 3D was the cherry on top of the cake!
"Dec 28, 2022",NEUTRAL,"This movie's messages (friendship, loyalty, trust, and courage to overcome your fears) are good but it is pretty Violent and a little scary for younger children."
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,A great family movie! Some of the humor was close to using swear words.
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,SUCH a good movie literally not a single complaint?? Only good things to say!
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,Loved it. Brought smiles and laughter. Lots of action and yet some touching scenes.
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,The Best Dreamworks Movie Ever!!!
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Liked the multi layer themes of family values, finding more important things than other things like stuff, and hept moving. Good for all ages!"
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"This is the epitome of cinematic entertainment! Brimmed with such vivid and bright colors yet having a dark contrast that elevates the visuals as well as the plot. Each character has development and something to add to the overall story that will leave you not only laughing and cheering but also terrified and emotionally moved. No doubt, the best animated feature of 2022."
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great movies, but no need to have language that is bleeped out. Our youth needs to learn to have conversations without profanity instead of making it appear acceptable."
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,Very funny!! Loved Perito
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"A great Movie not only for kids, it has good humor and the animation is perfekt!"
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,Cute movie for kids and also adults.
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Better than Shrek, a definite must-watch."
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,A little to long for small kids
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"The story, the jokes, the associations were perfect 'till the last damn detail. I'm from Bulgaria and the movie in the local cinema had bulgarian dubbing. The quality of the translation was also next tier. I have no words to describe how well it was animated, a feast for the eyes. It was trully satisfying to watch this movie, 10 out of 10."
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,Thought it was awesome!! Enjoyed the story line
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,simplemente increíble
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,has a very good storyline.
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Both my grand children loved the movie! My 8 year old grandson said he has seen all the other Puss in Boots movies, but this movie was the best one out of all of them."
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,Great movie totake my Grandchildren to. Very family friendly & great ending
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,This movie was amazing and wholesome for all ages especially the animation style to make it look more of a fairytale storybook in 3D. This movie brings out little a darker tone that contributes to the moral and drama of this story. This movie has taught me how to view death more as mean to live my life in things that matter on family and friends . And I am finally surprised that this movie has brought out a vulnerable side from our feline hero.
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"I'm not a big fan of animation movies, but i thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was very fun to watch tgis movie. Much recommended to any age groups."
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,A little slow in the beginning. Turns out very sweet and funny.
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,We loved it! The story line was great. Everyone needs someone. Enjoyed the cameos from the old characters. Hopefully we will see more in a land Far Far Far Away.
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Went with my children and expected to be entertained but not much more. This was more. It's well (voice)acted, the story is simple but very effective, it's visually very appealing (it has this mix of 3d and 2d that worked really well) but most of all it's extremely fun. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this movie."
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining, touching, with some fantastic looking animation and charming characters. The only downside maybe being the moral of the story being obvious from 10 miles away early on... but still a nice story! I had a blast with this movie and wanna see it again."
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Jo and I are not huge fans of the computer generated cartoons but there are exceptions and this one is an exception. The story was good, funny, took us back to our childhood with all the nursery rhymes we learnt from long ago. 

The cat was over the top funny and the star and the dog (who wanted to be a cat) were so 'precious' we both wanted to cuddle him/her. 

A cat has nine lives and Puss in Boots had used up eight of them. He had left his feline cat at the altar and loved being the centre of attraction when he did all his heroic deeds. 

There were plenty of villains all taken from the nursery rhymes and there was a good v evil plot and in the end only one real nasty - the others changed.  I won't give anything else away but do go and enjoy with your children.  Or like us, two old adults, relive your childhood again.

Highly recommended to ALL."
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"I wasn't sure if Puss was good for a fairy tale idea, but it worked wonders. Puss again kills the expectations and Antonio Banderas again makes me appreciate his hard work at giving a cute cat a bad-ass mannerism collection. PIB has again made me love the story as Puss again made his mark on the movie world. See it"
"Dec 28, 2022",NEUTRAL,"""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is a fun adventure in the ""Shrek"" universe! I gotta admit I have not seen the original film, and don't cherish the ""Shrek"" films as much as many do… so I went into this with mild expectations. And honestly, I had a good time; it was cute! Do I think it was as good as many other reviewers have suggested? No. But it was enjoyable, lighthearted fun that is perfect for families with kids! The voice cast was awesome, especially John Mulaney and Florence Pugh as the villains, Jack Horner and Goldilocks respectively. And of course Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots is iconic as ever!

The animation here was gorgeous too, honestly it was one of my favourite parts. I love that major studio animated movies are finally starting to take more risks with their animation style, moving away from the typical 3D CGI realism. You gotta respect ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" for starting this trend and showing that different styles can work! I loved that this had a more watercolor, storybook illustration look to it, it really worked for the story and was employed in such creative ways! I would love to see the ""Shrek"" movies take this on, but alas they seem to have established their own look. This movie just looked so cool, so distinct in its own style, it really felt like I was watching a story in a fairy tale world.

Now, of course I have to admit I didn't love this movie. Something about it felt off to me, I couldn't seem to see where the acclaim was coming from. Sure, it was fun, it was cute, and I enjoyed myself while watching, but I never felt like I truly connected with the film. The opening scene felt a little jumbled to me, rapidly going from a musical sequence, to comedy for kids, to an action scene and I wished it would've let me settle into the story a bit first. I get this is a movie primarily for kids, but with most animation they tend to make parts enjoyable for the parents and older audiences as well. I don't really feel that here — they tried with the themes and the deeper storyline — but it never actually worked in my eyes. Everything felt very kid-focused, which isn't a bad thing, it just meant I wasn't the core audience and so it makes sense why I wouldn't enjoy it as much. I have to say, the kids in my theatre seemed to be having a blast! I'm sure this is a great movie for families with children, it just wasn't as good as I was told it would be.

I think the movie tried to do a bit of what Pixar is known for, the whole ""trying to be deep"" thing. The movie involves Puss in Boots coming to terms with death, and it seemed to be somewhat shallow, it never truly dove into this aspect of the story. Instead, the storyline is very linear and somewhat dull where it is just about the characters traveling to their destination and the villains sometimes catching up and then combat ensuing. And the physical goal literally being the spiritual goal just makes the inevitable plot point of ""maybe I don't need the thing I wanted all long and it's the friends I made along the way that count"" seem all the more predictable. Even Puss' relationship with the side characters is unchallenging. Although he is deeply flawed, his companions never seem to care about that and forgive him all the time. The chemistry of the characters was just nowhere as endearing as in ""Shrek"". Still the adventure was quite fun, I just didn't think the themes clicked as it felt like they were trying to be deep in a way that is not as organic and surprising as a film like Pixar's ""Up"", ""Finding Nemo"" or even DreamWorks' ""How to Train Your Dragon"". 

Perhaps I am being too harsh, I feel like this review is sounding more negative than anything. I really did have fun with it, and overall would give it a thumbs up, it's an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half. The animation was really cool, the voice cast was great, and man I loved the little nods to the ""Shrek"" movies even if I was never a huge fan of those. If nothing else, this movie did make me really hopeful for another ""Shrek"" film. I do enjoy this fairy tale world and the creative animation they used to tell the story!"
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,It was funny and enjoyable to watch with family!
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"La Película es Visualmente Preciosa, la trama es excelente entretenida y perfecta para ver en familia la estuve esperando por todo este año y no me ha decepcionado. Aplausos para DreamWorks y su impecable trabajo"
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great references to other fairy tale characters.  ""ethical bug"" i.e., Jiminy Cricket with Jimmy Stewart-like voice was priceless"
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,Really cute. It's a long one but we enjoyed it the entire time.
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,Whole family loved the movie perfect movie for adults and children both can easily enjoy I would definitely go watch again in theaters
"Dec 28, 2022",NEUTRAL,a few good laughs.  Good family friendly movie.
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"The best cartoon movie i've seen in years ! 
Visuals, characters, story, everything is amazing !"
"Dec 28, 2022",NEGATIVE,"After seeing the overwhelmingly positive response to this movie, and all the great critics reviews, all I can say is that I must have seen a completely different movie. This was not only not amazing, it was actually pretty bad. I'm not even mad that it was bad, because Dreamworks hasn't been making good movies for about a decade now (sadly), so I wouldn't have bothered to see the movie except for the great reviews. And it is exactly as dumb as I originally thought it would be. If you think Puss in Boots 2 is a really great movie, trust me the bar is so much higher. Go watch the Dreamworks back catalog pre-2011, or Pixar pre-2010. If you want to watch a great animated movie made more recently, check out Spiderman Into the Spiderverse or The LEGO Movie. Also, GDT's Pinoccio was actually pretty solid. I don't want to demean anyone's tastes, just know that if you love animation and loved this movie, there is so much more great things to see so don't set your bar here. As for Dreamworks, I gotta say I'm so sad to see where you've ended up. I really miss the quality of movies you used to make. Prince of Egypt, Sinbad, El Dorado, Spirit, Kung Fu Panda 1&2, How to Train Your Dragon, Megamind, and even Shrek (I guess) these movies will all be remember long after your mediocre cash grabs such as Puss in Boots 2 are long forgotten."
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Very well written. Super entertaining. Even the teenagers enjoyed it 

Great family movie"

"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"The reign of Disney is officially OVER.  This film has it all: beautiful animation, clever plot, dialogue, compelling characters, and some of the best storyboarded action scenes that I’ve ever seen… and in 2022 that’s saying a lot!"
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,Super cute. Maybe a little too much Spanish speaking characters for an English movie.
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,I was excited to see the film with my kids and was so surprised and how good it actually was.  One of the characters is absolutely chilling and is an amazing development!  It's so nice to see a deeper level lot line!

"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Love movie and service staff are great, TY"
"Dec 28, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I honestly was very disappointed as all 17 of my children left the cinema in tears as the main villain was very very scary, he made very crude jokes such as demeaning puss and boots because he was a cat. Puss and boots's death was very badly writing voice acted and animated. I took my wife's, (all 3 of them) to see the movie with me and the shirtless guy at the front of the cinema made the movie just a bit better although it may not have been intended"
"Dec 28, 2022",NEGATIVE,Wasnt funny like the first one was. Actually boring. Big disappointment.
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,Love the art and animation style! Great original story with familiar elements from the previous Puss in Boots & Shrek Franchises. Loved it! Hope Dream Works brings back more stories from the Shrek Franchise or spinoffs.

"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,Great movie. Great story
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,It was amazing according to my 8 year old granddaughter. She especially liked his theme song. It was a little violent for my 3 year old but there was lots of color to peel her interest.
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Awesome family movie, great story, can’t wait to see it again."
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,really great family movie
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,Entertaining and hilarious

Please."
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,Very cute movie great for the family!
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Very well paced. I loved every single character in this movie. Hilarious, entertaining and, at times, even scary. It took a little too long for the adventure to get started, but when it did, it was amazing. The animation was also amazing. The water colour animation was so pleasing to the eyes and the action sequences were so much fun to watch. I'm really excited to see more of this universe."
"Dec 28, 2022",NEGATIVE,Not young kid appropriate! Swearing and really dark and intense villain. My kids 5-7 were all really scared!
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Beautiful/colorful animation,engaging/emotional story,spectacular voice-acting,awesomely hilarious,fun and dark,as well as being even better than its 2011 predecessor.Indeed pray for mercy from the latest installment of the Shrek franchise and prepare for quite a film with a bright/returning future for the beloved DreamWorks franchise ahead.Praise be to Puss in Boots:The Last Wish!"

"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,It was the best animation movie I have ever seen in my entire life.
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"It was a good movie, but I didn’t like the bad words in the movie. I love when there are adult jokes in kid movies, but I could do without the bad words"
"Dec 27, 2022",NEGATIVE,This movie was rated G in our area and it definitely should not have been. This is more of a PG rating. It has terrible language and is quite scary in parts for little kids. At one point they talked of putting a dog in a sock with a rock and throwing it in the river. We actually walked out and so did 5 other families with little kids. Older kids would be fine but heads up if you're going with little children.
"Dec 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Love the characters, but too much animation glitz took away from the sweet story.  The voices were wonderful,  Not quite as good as the first one."
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Entertaining and fun for the family
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Much better than I expected. It was also kind of scary with that wolf!

"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Took my son to go see it and we both loved it! It had humor for both kids and adults to enjoy. At the same time it told a sweet story of friendship filled with lots of action and references to old fairy tales and nursery rhymes. Great family movie!
"Dec 27, 2022",NEGATIVE,Very dark. My daughter asked to leave because she was bored
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,The animation was amazing loved how the characters changed frame rate of the characters slowed within intense scenes
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Very cute! We loved it!

"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Everything an animated movie should be. Beautiful and entertaining.

"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Goated goated goated. Plz provide with Shrek 5.
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,See this on the big screen..it's a must

"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Great movie to watch with family. The story is beautiful and way above my expectations.
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,What a great movie I definitely love the puppy I thought the wolf was pretty badass too I hope we can see him again
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"This is one of Dreamwork's best movies yet. It's so good from the animation to the pacing to the story itself, and the themes/messages woven throughout are not only hard-hitting but also genuine and raw. The wolf as the villain is wonderful and the side characters are all loveable, particularly Perrito and Goldi and the Three Bears. Kitty Softpaws and Puss's dynamic is hilarious yet beautiful, and their arc throughout the movie is incredible. I'm not even going to try to describe how amazed I was at Puss's development throughout the film, how he goes from an adventure-driven, self-obsessed and reckless swashbuckler to a more humble and introspective (but still swashbuckling!) cat, having learned from his experiences throughout all of his nine lives and through his encounters with death - literally. 
I loved this movie so, so much and I could probably talk about it all day, but I won't keep you. GO SEE IT!!"
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"better than the first movie! The animations are wonderful, I loved the wolf character and the moral is moving! Great movie."
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Better than Shrek 2.
"Dec 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Was cute.. Thought it would been a little better, with a little more adult humor but overall good."
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"If you enjoyed The Shrek saga this one is a must see, it's fun and also the story is really good."
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"It was a good comedy, it's supposed to be a kid movie though and it had some bleeps where inappropriate words were implied. While that is funny to adults, it may give the wrong impression to children."
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"way way better than I'd have ever expected. took the kids to see it on a whim, and loved it."
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"soooo goooood, love it so much"
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Nothing new, but nothing wrong with that either. It knows what works and executes it to excellent results."
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,It was funny not just for kids but something adults could enjoy as well!
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Funny and exciting movie with a great storyline
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Very cute. Finally politically free. just a fun and funny kids' movie. The way it should be
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"I loved this moving surprisingly as I am not a huge fan of the 1st one, it had so many hidden gems and insights to what everyone deals with."
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,We loved this movie! Took my grandkids to see it and they loved every minute of it! Very cute movie
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,I LOVE Puss in Boots!  - the subtle comedy makes it enjoyable for the adults without having to cover the ears of the kids!!!!
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"My Son wanted me to take him to this movie, Puss N Boots. I didn’t really think I would enjoy this movie but it turned out to be really funny with a Nursery Rhyme theme. I would recommend this movie to all kids and Dads!"
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"The good, the better and the best"
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"We took our grandchildren, and we all thought it was adorable.  The characters were cute, and the storyline was very good.  Some good life lessons included.  It was worth seeing."
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Best animated movie in 3 years
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Very entertaining for young and old kids!!
"Dec 27, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Non è un film della dreamworks, sono molto deluso da questo, posso farmi andare bene la grafica, figuriamoci, peró ci sono troppe cose che si distaccano dal primo film e da tutto il mondo di shrek.
Innazitutto mancano tutte quelle battute e quei doppi sensi che fanno sempre ridere , il tema dell'amicizia sembra essere utilizzato per buonismo o comunque per far vedere questo film anche a dei bebè, il cagnolino è uno stupido totale, irritante a livelli stratosferici e sembra che ce lo abbiano piazzato per mettere quel soggetto ""giovane"" che in realtà risulta solo una caricatura fatta da un boomer che non se ne capisce un'acca di cosa vogliono vedere i giovani.
Se mio figlio fosse già nato non gli avrei mai fatto vedere questo film, perfavore tornate al vecchio stile."
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"I was afraid that this movie would suffer the same lack of quality that most movies suffer these days 
I'm more than glad I was wrong"
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Loved the animation style and character development! Super cute parts, and awesome fight scenes!"

"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Went to see this on a whim, surprisingly really good movie! I laughed, I cried, I was surprised by the cool bad guy. All around solid movie."
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Fun and full of action
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Great movie for kids and adults.  I felt comfortable with my child watching it.  Much better than the stuff Disney has out now a days
"Dec 27, 2022",NEGATIVE,Adult content with underlying bullying for a.childrens movie.  Love puss and.boots but too serious for.young child movie
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Really great animation scenes, great characters, good storyline, and cool “bad” guys. This was a great update to the old movie, and I really loved the fairy tale aspects. Good for kids and adults alike, but of course kids will like even more. "
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,did not the wild whistling
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Really good for adults and children alike. Great morals and funny throughout, Burrito and Goldi are the standouts"
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"A heart warming, swashbuckling, show stopper! Leaps and bounds ahead of other animated fare. A fun morality tale bottled in a densely plotted movie."
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,A new favorite… had more fun than the children…
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great, great movie.  Will see again and lots of quotes"
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is by far the best animated movie I've seen in quite some time now. With its beauty and unique art style, blend of fairytales, and charming story it is sure to be a film I return to."
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,the film it's very mature funny and completely enteryaining the characters like perrito or the wolf they are a icon of the plot
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great movie, had a little bit of everything!  Maybe not for a 5 year old, some bleeping seems ( but funny ) , might cause nightmares because of the rival."

"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"This was an incredible film! I really appreciated the beautiful animation and the funny, relatable characters.

I want to see this again!"
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Very cute but more cussing than I would have liked
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Great movie n very entertaining for my granddaughters.

"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Highly recommend you see Puss in boots, highly recommend you see it in cinemas before it's too late.

It has been a long time since I had the option to go watch an actually good movie in cinemas. Puss in Boots the last wish may have some small flaws but this movie is phenomenal and I loved all the characters.

Please go watch this movie in cinemas, do not wait for it to come out on streaming and do NOT pirate it. You will have the best first impression of this movie by seeing it in cinemas and I kid you not, I wished there were more people in the theater with me when I went to see it, I feel like people are missing out on something that truly feels magical and is full of fun.

Got to be one of Dreamworks, if not the movie industries greatest films of this year. I'm so glad I chose to watch this incredible movie and give it my money instead of handing it to ""Blue people play in water"" the movie."
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Interesting tie in to fairytales.  Great animation.
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Adorable.  Great animation

"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"loved it, good for kids and things to think about for adults.  a little scary for really young children.  and not too long after coming off of a few recent 3 hour movies"
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"I wondered where they go with a puss in boots movie here but it's a fairly clever storyline, tying into known fairytales. characters are good, animation excellent, the motions of the characters shown very well. not my no 1 movie of the year but very good"
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Took the whole family, other than some bleeping for foul language, it was kid friendly. Also very funny"
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Great movie. Might be a bit scary for little ones.
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,It was a very wholesome movie! The cinematography was amazing too!
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"La saga de Shrek es  muy irregular  solo las 2 primeras películas son buenas y la primera del gato con botas no fue muy rescatable ni recordable , pero en esta ocasión está película parece ofrecer una esperanza de renacer , ya que con una animación espectacular y un guión bastante filosófico nos brinda una película bastante encantadora poniendose  como la segunda película animada del año solo por debajo de pinocho de Guillermo del toro.
  Esta película es un deleite en todos sentido , es graciosa y es emotiva en momentos brindado un regreso que Dreamworks necesitaba , perrito es un personaje hermoso  que enamora desde el primer momento que aparece y  hasta el último momento de la película lo amas ,
El gato sigue siendo tan carismático y menos pesado que en las últimas películas de la saga ya que recupera su  brillo al ser vulnerable y lo vuelve más cercano , el lobo como la representación de la muerte es otro punto genial de la película es brillante y espero se destaque en futuras películas .

En los puntos flojos es el doblaje argentino de rizitos de oro y los 3 osos qu desentona muchísimo en comparación con el doblaje mexicano , sin embargo los los personajes son geniales y el doblaje no los arruina .
por otro lado la gata no tiene  nada que aportar es un personaje poco relevante más que para el chiste de los ojos de gato , el villano es interesante si es amenazante pero me quedé con ganas de que lo desarrollen mas pero no es malo me agrado , el Pepe grillo fue divertido y genial con la voz deo maestro Francisco colmenaro y el giro de que fuera la conciencia del villano me gustó que se rindió al ver que el tipo era irredimible 
C: 8.4/10"
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Pretty good, Objectively good animation a lovely not overused story also lovely final seek peek.... Pretty recommended"

"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"My 8 year old son and I loved the movie and the characters. The only thing I could have possibly done without, is the cussing/bleeping, although it did make it a little funnier. Overall, it was a cute movie and we can’t wait for whatever comes next."
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Awesome movie great for kids hopefully they continue with the end and bring back Shrek!
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,I just loved the whole movie!!

"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots 2 is a stellar return to the covenant Shrek franchise.  The franchises future looks bright, this amazing new era for Shrek films is an absolute delight, and I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  5/5"
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,Best movie. I’m not kidding.
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"I absolutely loved it from start to finish. a great addition to the Shrek/Puss universe. Great, fun new art style too!"
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Oh my god, I did not expect this to be so gosh dang good as it is. I only saw one review of this movie beforehand watching it and it said that this movie needs to do well in the box office, and I wholeheartedly agree because this sequel to a spin-off is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. I'm not exaggerating, there was not a single moment in the movie where I was bored. I was constantly engaged, every character was amazing, I need this film to do well"
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,Awesome fun movie for the family that combines some old school fairytales most have grown up with. Also has a good moral to the story.
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,It was a great family movie with non-stop entertainment. Highly recommend
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,Great movie took my 4yr old to this for his 1st movie at the theater and he loved it. He stayed engaged with the movie the whole way through.
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Must watch, I loved every second of this movie!"
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,Animation was amazing.
"Dec 26, 2022",NEGATIVE,it was cursing in the movie and i wasn’t funny or excitement for my 5 years old daughter very disappointed on her birthday
"Dec 26, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Although some of the characters were endearing, it took considerable time to ""connect"" with characters, and to root for them. The actions scenes seems to switch from CG to regular animation. The motions look stilted and not as sharp as the other scenes. On the positive side, the story does finally get going and, in the end, we were rooting for them. Good, positive themes like family, love and living fully. Foundation laid for a future sequel with Puss in Boots and someone special. Good clean fun for children."
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Never a dull moment, insane action, great comedy. One of the greatest animated movies of ALL TIME. Ive seen a lot of animated movies so you can believe me when I say you need to see Puss in boots 2."
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,So good. It had a little bit of humor for everybody.
"Dec 26, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Wow, RT scores have been seriously inflated. This is a 70% movie at best. Wasn't bad, wasn't great…but not 95%! You're telling me this is on the level of shrek, avengers, titanic, etc?"
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,Really really good. Better than expected! The tease at the end also the cherry on top.
"Dec 26, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Very dark, needed more humour. Not really sure it's aim at kids"
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,I like this one better.
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"I love the character of Puss in Boots! However, when he finally got his own solo movie, I couldn't help but find it underwhelming! It wasn't awful, I just didn't have the energy that I wanted. Turns out, The Last Wish is everything that I wanted from the first Puss in Boots!
The animation is quick yet detailed, a lot of the comedy is really dark and really funny, the action sequences are incredibly fast and creative, and the movie has a lot of great drama and heart.
The movie does have flaws though. Because everything feels so fast, the pacing can often times feel really rushed, and some of the comedy can come off as a little annoying.
But still, this movie was better than it had any right to be! This is almost everything that I wanted from a Puss in Boots movie and, although it's no game changer, it is satisfyingly fun!"
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,Adorable film for kids and adults
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,Kid approved ✅ Super fun to watch!
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,Action  Filled and fun for the whole family

It was cute"
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great character,  amazing voice acting, and fun animation!!!!  A must watch!!!!!"

"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,So funny. Great movie for all
"Dec 26, 2022",NEGATIVE,Awful. Just plain Awful.
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Introduced one of my new favorite villains. Very well done. DreamWorks is one of the few left that remember the most important part about entertainment and movies. Focusing on a good story. Thank you guys for keeping it a priority, it shows in how great this movie was. Keep it up, please don't change."
"Dec 26, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Not as good as I was hoping it would be.  Lots of action, dialogue and character interaction but unfortunately not a memorable movie.  I don't think the child I was with understood much of the storyline."
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,SUPER MOVIE!!!! 👍🏿
"Dec 26, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Cute kids movie with some adult humor thrown in. Cute for the whole family. We took our 4 kids ages 2,6,12 &13 and they all loved it,"

"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,The best! Loved the newest Puss in Boots movie!!
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,A nice holiday film. Light and entertaining especially for kids. The voice-overs were great and the animation superb. I was looking for something relatively stress-free (and I wasn't ready to sit for three hours) so this film filled the bill.
"Dec 26, 2022",NEUTRAL,Some scenes were intense and inappropriate for children. The movie had 25% child humor and 75% adult humor.
"Dec 26, 2022",NEUTRAL,"The movie was funthe characters expressive. However, it drug for a bit."
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"This is the best movie I have ever seen and I've seen a lot of movies. Perfect.
Animation 10
Characters 10
Story 10
Humor 10"
"Dec 26, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Not for young children!! This was one of the darkest themed children’s movies I have seen in a long time. We were so excited to see it because the commercials looked so good. But the overall theme of death was very strong, and my 4 year old was terrified for most of the movie. Would not recommend"
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Absolutely outstanding! Just watched it today in Australia when it came out and the animation was amazing, storyline gorgeous and characters story building insane!!!!"
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,PUSS IS GOATED. Great movie! Very touching and has valuable insight throughout the film. Sets up the movie for the return of Shrek. This film is a must if you're a fan of dreamworks!
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,a great movie all the way around for kids and adults
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Way better than 1st, setting up for Shrek the return"
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,Great family friendly wholesome movie! Loved everything about the story to the 2D animation action scenes! Didn't have to worry about seeing something uncomfortable with that another company has been doing lately with there movies. Its definitely great to see Puss in Boots back on the big screen!
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,Absolutely LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,Loved the story line! Fun movie!
"Dec 26, 2022",NEUTRAL,"""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is fast and fun, with surprisingly deep themes. This is a movie that I think all ages can definitely enjoy together, but I can see kids completely eating up. I really like this new visual style DreamWorks has been doing lately and think it looks really cool. The story is solid but I think more than anything I liked the emotions the film genuinely is able to earn with its characters and messages. There is a good amount of humor and action that also keeps the movie's pace moving consistently. Overall, it is a sweet movie you can see with the whole family and one that features some really visually slick animation."
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"A whimsical mashup of fairy tales delivers soulful wisdom of true love in humorous, visually stunning action packaging. Smart and spirited, a wish of a lifetime come true — dont miss it!"
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"This was one of the best animated 3D movies ever! Very imaginative, excellent characters, good story line, highly effective 3D."

"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,Dream works is clear of stupid Disney 
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,That it was available with Spanish subtitles
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"It was cute, didnt think all the naughty language was necessary."
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"What a really unexpectedly great time! I went with 3 children and 6 adults and the adults had a ton of fun and a lot to discuss after the movie. The performances are great, you expect Antonio and Salma, but  Harvey Guillen as Perro was a real show stealer! Such a great addition and really just does so great amongst veterans of the industry, the ending was also hype, the animation was freaking awesome with gripping action sequences that had fun sequences and transitions. This is a really unexpected movie that I would absolutely watch again!"
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"The premise is great and the revelation of what has changed internally for Puss is remarkable. Also, the charm of the ""Shrek"" franchise as found through fairy tale characters is prominent in this film."
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,Great movie with lots of comedic moments and a great storyline.
"Dec 26, 2022",NEGATIVE,We took my 5 year old to it on Christmas Day and it was SCARY! Super heavy content and not nearly as light hearted or entertaining as the first. Huge bummer.

"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Such an amazing movie!!! Loved every minute of it, would go watch again"

"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,I like everything in the new movie can’t wait for the next good movie
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Super buena para poder ver en familia, lo unico en lo que fallo el estudio es el tipo de animacion, debieron hacerlo del mismo estilo que la primera, fuera de eso, estuvi buena"
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Action pack storyline, funny AI"
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,It was the type of movie that would appeal to both adults and children.
"Dec 26, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Good flick, prefer the other ones."

"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,My family loved this move! Well done.

"Dec 26, 2022",NEUTRAL,It was colorful.  It was storybook-ness.  It was a little draggy at times.   But still cute!
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Loved everything about the movie! The storyline, the characters, the animation and most especially Puss. Without Antonio Banderas there wouldn’t be Puss In Boots. Excellent! Go see it!"
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"great story, great visuals, fun voice performances, great time at the movies!"
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Masterpiece. The blending of 2D and 3D animation is amazing, and the frame rate switching was very cool"

"Dec 26, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Subtly Dark. I enjoyed it. But I would not recommend this movie if you and your family are expecting it to be tame like the first one.
Foul language is thrown around in ways I don't want my kids repeating. Plus the Big bad Wolf is INTENSE!"
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,Great and funny. Love this and my kids love it
"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,"This was one of the best Puss in Boots stories, yet. The story was funny, intense and was filled with more meaning than expected. Most importantly, the kids loved it, and other than a few bleeped words, there was nothing snuck in most parents would disapprove of."
"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,"Super cute, better than expected!"
"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,"Fun, action-filled and entertaining. Not for younger children though. Just long enough too."
"Dec 25, 2022",NEGATIVE,Theater was very cold. No heat. It must have been 45-50 degrees.
"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,"Had low expectations because the first movie was lackluster. However, the imaginative characters & interesting plot won me over. Laughed many times & was impressed with the theme of the story. Varied animation styles for dialogue/plot vs. action scenes was an interesting choice that worked well. Only negative would be a little dark for younger children, but most kids that watch typical PG action movies should be fine. Worth a watch!"
"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,Pussy N Boots was an excellent movie. Great for kids and adults.
"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,"Me encantó la película, buena trama y antagonistas."

One for the holidays!🎄"

"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,Good movie and short
"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,Much better that expected!
"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,"A truly heartwarming story that succeeds in creating its own story while still being part of the Shrek universe. The movie is actually really good at building up tension, it's characters have clear motivations and are easy to empathize with
And it's actually a surprising good movie to watch during Christmas! (I know Avatar is a great choice for Christmas in 2022 as well but still). Furthermore: beautiful animation style (comic-like) and a joy for all audience ages. It is also oddly therapeutic. Or should I say oddly therapy dog?"
"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,"There are so many things to love about this movie. It's visually stunning , with some scenes departing from straight CGI to a sort of drawn animation & comic book shadowing and sensibility in a sort of Akira Toriyama effect. Great action scenes over visually rich backdrops and ambience. The humor was very well done and I found the jokes quite funny. The voice actors were perfect. And there were interesting nods to external cultural memes that were a lot of fun such as several obvious references to specific Sergio Leone western scenes and style flourishes. And after all, any 2022 film that has a Jiminy Cricket knockoff character with a Jimmy Stewart inspired voice has something going on worthwhile."
"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,"Amazing, everyone who worked on it is great )"
"Dec 25, 2022",NEGATIVE,"This movie has little depth.  It may entertain your 5 year old, but parents expect to be bored out of your minds."
"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,It has a very nice ending. I liked that it was kid friendly
"Dec 25, 2022",NEGATIVE,Kids lost interest toward the end and wanted to leave! I thought it was Meh! I am truly disappointed there was no better Holiday movies out for the kids during December! Come on Hollywood and Disney! Get with the program!
"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,"Brillant movie. I feel it's the second-best movie in the Shrek franchise, and hopefully the start of many more movies from the Shrek universe."
"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,Family-funny flick! Recommended to bring lots of laughs.
"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,"I went to see it today with my daughter. No expectation besides see good animation. But the history was deep, moving, sad and joyful. Absolutely recommended. I really like it so much. Thanks for bring this movie to the public."
"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,"Amazing animation, the on-two animation style was absolutely stunning."
"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,"Very interesting movie and it is the best-animated movie in 2022 for Puss In Boots The Last Wish.
My best character is Perro for funny moments for what's happened next."

"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,Very good!!! I recommend watching it.
"Dec 25, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I liked the previous movies better this one just seems like al the new animations they push out the editing and and characters just look off and there's beeped out curse words that your children would understand the editing/animation annoys me because some parts you loose focus because of the movements and all the small Spanish speaking portions don't have subtitles so I don't know what they said at certain parts
Overall I spent 1/5th of the movie complaining to myself"
"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,"Funny movie even for me, a 35 year old dad. My 6 year old enjoyed it."
"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed it. Fun.
"Dec 25, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Beautiful animation and fun characters, with a passable story, tainted by cheap swear jokes and a high and brutal body count for a kids movie."
"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,Loved the story line
"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,absolutely the best movie of 2022
"Dec 25, 2022",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed it. Good character development, some depth, plenty of action and comedy. Banderas does a great job with this more complex version of Puss. Also some very good side characters from fairy tales (and nursery rhymes) show up."

"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"THIS IS A MASTERPIECE. Please absolutely support this movie. Animated films NEED to be more like Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. The stylistic choices, the art, the animation, the story, the voice acting, the characters, absolutely everything about this movie is incredibly well done. This movie sets the bar high for animated films, and takes full advantage of every creative opportunity. This is my first time ever leaving a review on a movie, I made an account solely to leave a review, because this film deserves it. I saw it on release, I will probably see it again, and I will definitely buy the DVD on release. PLEASE watch this work of art."
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,the movie was really cute and really good
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,Great for kids and adults! Havent enjoyed a move like this in a long time.
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots was a GAME-CHANGER. It absolutely changes my perspective towards animated movies. I used to think that I was no longer a child and could not relate to these types of movie until I watched Puss in Boots with my younger sister. The movie brings more than just a children's movie. It teaches us to value our friendship , our family, and most importantly, our lives. LIVE LIKE IT'S YOUR LAST DAY!"
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,Loved the colors and the action!
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,Top notch story with laughs all the way through the whole movie. Beautifully written for all ages to enjoy!
"Dec 24, 2022",NEUTRAL,"A good movie.  Good Story, Enjoyable adventure.  BUT the animation style feels like they cut corners and had a limited budget. Not as polished as the Shrek movies."
"Dec 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,"First of all, there were at least 30 minutes of previews and my 6 yr old granddaughter and 7yr old grandson kept asking when will the movie start. The very beginning of the movie was a little entertaining but they both also asked why it was so loud. When a scary wolf creature appeared, I crossed my fingers that it would hurry up and get past that but it didnt. And when the fight between the wolf and Puss displayed a drop of blood on the cats face, my granddaughter turned to me and said that she did not like the movie and wanted to leave.so we did. My grandson mentioned that he also did not like the movie. Its probably my fault for taking them to a PG rated movie so next time Ill know better."
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"It was hilarious, incredibly animated, and has heart warming themes. Everyone in the theatre laughed at the funny parts and held each other close at the intense parts. The movie was spectacular and brought everything I love about Dreamworks Studio and overall movies together. I would recommend everyone watches it!"
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,Family of 6. Kids ages 7-15. We all loved it.
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,The Fairy Tale figures in the story line
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"I went in with my kids expecting another lack-luster Puss movie. Boy was I wrong. The animation was clean and fresh with certain sequences standing out due to the frame rate and editing. The normally one dimensional Puss has some major character development yet does not overshadow the charming supporting cast. The voice work was very well done. The story had excellent pacing not hampered by non-stop action, but enriched with its addition. An overall charming movie that will stand the test of time and will set an industry standard for animation."
"Dec 24, 2022",NEUTRAL,Happy that there was a movie out this Christmas to take the little ones to.
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,Absolutely amazing!!!! But a little scary for me as a child... :)
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,My kid and their friends had a feast with this.  How can you not like a kitty in boots.
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,Good family outing with this one.
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,The moral of the story was great you only have one life stop overlooking what you do have for what you wish you had
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,It was a funny movie. The kids enjoyed it a lot.
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"Specially after disappointing Avatars 
I dont know where they got the idea killing sea creatures are ok with kids.
I took my grandson who is 8 years old and was looking forward to watch this movie asked me to leave which we did.
Bad mov
But this he had fun and I was happy to see him was enjoying the movie.

"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"I thought this movie was incredible!! From an analysis stand point the characters and character development was pretty good. Also the camera  work was incredible and the animation style!! Not a moment went by where I didn't think ""wow"" and especially the introduction to the big bad wolf, it was breathtaking. And this was as well a very fun movie for kids it definitely teaches some good lessons about selfishness and self control!"
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,Better then the original 
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,This was a Super cute movie. It teaches a valuable lesson. Life is not about fortune or fame but who you share it with that makes it worth living. Perrito the chihuahua was my favorite character.  Little yet fierce and really was one of the main characters. I loved the humor. My daughter loved it too. What you waiting for? Go watch it!

"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great movie for families, even better if you're a fan of Animation, and the Shrek Movies. Very funny, lots of action too-- the tease at the end had us all cheering. One of the antagonists was pure nightmare fuel, very well done."
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,Loved it! A great way to tie in everything!
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"Still so entertaining. Hats off to the secondary characters, especially Goldilocks and the three Bears!!"

"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"It was very amazing. The last wish was filled with original adventurous feelings, old love and friendship. This movie is just as good as the first Puss in Boots movie. 10/10"
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"A most perfect new standard for Hollywood animation. Absolutely funny, gorgeous to watch, and ...

Let's go Team Friendship!"
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,I liked the narrative
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,I cried...twice. I don't even like the first Puss in Boots but the sequel is amazing. Best Shrek movie since Shrek 2. Go see it in theaters if you can!
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,Well done pulling in many fairytales.

us out to the theaters, and I wasn't
that enthusiastic about watching
this movie, but my GOD, as an animator and digital artist, THE MOVIE WAS SO GOOD?? Like, not just story wise but the animation was MMMMMMMMM SO GOOD.
The change of frame rates, the color palette, THE DETAIL AND STYLE?!? Truly felt like eye candy, amazing movie, made me cry. Never have or wanted to watch the first one, but this new one gave me motivation to just, watch the shrek franchise all over again."
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"Fresh and exciting with a captivating art style and witty dialogue enjoyed by kids and adult in the audience,   Highly recommended!"
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,a. complete must see. funny. heart warming. got a bigger applause than Avatar 2 lol.
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"I have seen a lot of movies this year and this was surprisingly the best of the bunch. I didn't have very high expectations, but I wanted to see a movie with my daughter. This was surprisingly much more than a kid's movie."

"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Very entertaining for young and old!
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"This movie is one of the best I've seen all year, animation wise as it is stunning in visuals and it's action sequences. The story is very well written as it left me never bored when watching the film. The movie is much like the other Shrek movies made for kids but also keeping adults in mind. Also I love that this focuses more on the more mature aspects of the Shrek universe, with it focusing on the morality of Puss"
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"I didn’t expect the movie to be really good, but it was."
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Me and my son . Love it 10 put of 10

"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Very entertaining and well constructed story and touching.  Great family fun.  Loved it.
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Legitimately an amazing experience overall. The additional worldbuilding this movie provides for the Shrek universe is quite frankly needed in the leadup to the much anticipated Shrek 5. The story is phenomenal and all the villains are well thought out and cleverly written. One of the best movies I have seen in a long time.
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"We, as adults, enjoyed the movie.  Our grandchildren were with us and our grandson also enjoyed the movie.  Our granddaughter however was not as impressed.  She didn't like the violence in the movie.  There were parts that were a little dark.  Overall, it was a good movie and I would recommend it."
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"One of the best animated movies for a while..  Great fun for whole family - adventure, humor, heart.  Perfect for the holidays.."
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Son loves this cat in boots.

"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Winner with all the kids!
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"Me and my boyfriend went to see this movie just because we thought it would be a cute, silly, fun one to watch. It was surprisingly good! He even said it was the best movie he's watched in years! It was very engaging and I was never bored or zoning out I wanted to know what happened every second. It was funny, charming and even a bit spooky. The wolf character was genuinely scary at times. I already want to go see it again so I definitely think you should too!"
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Saw this twice with the kids already. Should I say more.
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Very well done with a great plot and beautiful animation.
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,It was great movie and silly and funny and hilarious too and the cats are so cute and the dog in the bears where ctue and the people too and the hole movie was funny too
"Dec 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,It was a bit too comic book animated and not near as funny for the adults like the first one
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Private viewing for a birthday party and all kids loved it! Adults as well! Must see! 
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"I just watched it and it is amazing, when a character comes in the tone of the movie just changes and when he whistles the music just stops and you hear only that, it is horryfing and I love it"
"Dec 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,My 11yr old and I liked this movie it was good but didnt find it 5 star worthy
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Best animated movie I have seen in a while since Spider-Verse. Every frame of the movie is a cinematic masterpiece. Please check it out if you have not yet
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Enjoyed this with the kids. It's a family-friendly movie.
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Entertaining.  Good for kids and adults.
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"This movie was amazing, the movie had a deeper story for Puss and I was completely locked into the movie the whole time. It was so action-packed and exciting. Fantastic movie and made me love Puss in Boots even more."
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"sweet, fresh, and beautifully animated film is the logan of the Shrek universe"
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,The movie was so cute and amazing! Was worth going to! Would see it again for sure!
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Great to take the kids to see and get funny adult humor just like the Shrek movies ect.
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"Cutest movie Ive seen in such a long time (,:"
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"Thank you Dreamscape for giving us a movie we can take our little ones to see and not have to worry about the content. The story was full of funnies, and a good lesson on how important family is. All 3 of our little ones (6, 7, & 10) LOVED it. "
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Great movie the kids loved it
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"The music, story and animation come together to form this masterpiece. I'm not kidding.
Sure, it has some jokes aimed at kids (being a kids movie and all) but the movie quickly turns around to show you either the most beautiful and dynamic animation you've seen since Spiderverse, or the most bone chilling and thrilling fight scenes.
Also the story is so heartwarming and honest with it's themes that you'll shed a tear at least once.
And the music is excellent, just like the first movie, making use of it's Spanish influence to bring you some great bops.
Just watch it, it's the holidays and you'll have a great time."
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"The best Dreamworks movie since the How to Train Your Dragon franchise. Went into the movie expecting a very by the book's sequel, but instead was given a fun, emotional, and visually beautiful movie about the value of life."
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"I loved it, not sure if some of the parts are scary for some kids though."
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved this movie! Watched with my two daughters and both of them as well as myself agree it is an entertaining, funny, and suspenseful experience for the whole family! The animation was just beautiful and the characters were so funny and well designed."
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Such a good movie!!!!!
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"So funny, it had out whole family laughing!"
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,A great movie for children and adults
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"So so so so good, omg the characters were perfect and animation on point!!!"
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,This is a must-see movie! The characters were all so creative and the movie itself had a very strong story line! I enjoyed it very much and so did my friends!
"Dec 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Not what we expected at all - it was very violent for a children's movie. Having the grim reaper (wolf) come after Puss in Boots wasn't necessary at all, except to teach kids that death comes after you and death is evil!"
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed this movie a lot! Watching it with my family was so fun! Some senes were too funny, and the characters were perky and funny! Would 100% recommend this!"
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"I absolutely loved this movie! It was so good  and the characters were funny and cute!  I would not recommend to those younger then six, because there are some scary parts, but other then that it's so funny and has a good plot!"
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,I'm eleven years old and went to see this movie with my family. It's hilarious and has a strong storyline. I would totally recommend you watch this movie!!
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"So, love this kitty.  Light, fun and the kids will love it!"
"Dec 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Good graphics, but storyline for children a bit unclear."
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,MUST WATCH NOW. THERE ARE SOME MISSING PIECES TO ME BUT ITS LITERALLY LEGENDARY. I THOUGHT THE DOG WOULD BE ANNOYING BUT SOMEHOW THEY MADE HIM SUPER WHOLESOME. WATCH IT IMMEDIATLEY. REVIVE DREAMWORKS.
"Dec 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Classic Dreamworks comedy, very different animation, but still entertaining."
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,AWESOME SAUCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,It's predictable in many ways but still enjoyable.
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,the dog stole the show
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,This is such a good movie. The animation was stunning. It had a Spider-man into the spider-verse vibe.
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"It was a good story, had funny parts but my children (7yrs old) were the first to point out the foul language used quite often throughout the movie which was rather disappointing"
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Cute and great movie
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Whole family loved it.... Was funny and entertaining! Certainly some darker parts but not nightmare inducing by any means.
"Dec 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,Disliked the Fairy Tales that they incorporated into the movie.  I will not watch again.
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Entertaining for adults too!
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,for starters THIS MOVIE IS PERFECT IN EVERY WAY IMAGINABLE THE ANIMATION THE ART THE VOICES THE MUSIC EVERYTHING LOOKS GREAT BRO 1000000000000000000/10
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,My son loves this movie.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"Surprisingly good movie. Animation was phenomenal, characters felt authentic, soundtrack is one of the best I've ever listened to, humor was fairly decent, and the plot was emotional at times. Many excellent decisions were made here to craft this movie into a must see for kids and adults alike."
"Dec 22, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Loved the story line.  Very cute movie.  Didn't care for how some of the animation was done...just didn't like that style, personally."
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,I liked the part when that pup was cursing and it was very funny
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Great movie for the entire family.It was suggested by one of my grandson. They both loved it and I loved it too.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"Truly an excellent film! The animation was beautiful, the characters are funny, and the plot is deeper and more emotionally-engaging than one might think it is from the preview. My daughter was a little scared by the ""Death"" character, but not enough to ruin the experience for her. Kids and adults alike will really enjoy this movie! Go see it!"
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"I really think this is the best movie of the Shrek Franchise.
The plot was good, it was visually amazing, it kept the Shrek spirit with a solid humor and the character of the wolf was so well made.
Well done DreamWorks this movie was far beyond my expectations for a movie that is just here to get people into Shrek again before the Shrek 5 release and I have a very good feeling for this upcomming movie."
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"It has the adventurous energy from the Puss In Boots prequel, but with the comedic tone from Shrek 2! The visuals are gorgeous with some very surprising new characters thrown into the mix. Overall storyline was a great addition to the Shrek franchise and is a fun time for the family or just adults."
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,We are sucker for kittens....too cute.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Fun-filled family movie that we all enjoyed.  So get your popcorn and give it a whirl!
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"Must see for Shrek fans, Puss in Boots fans, and movie fans in general. Fun romp and a good time all around."
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"A really fun and cute movie that the whole family can enjoy. The animation is beautiful, the story is funny and interesting and all the voice actors are great. For more movie thoughts, follow me @MedleyMovies"
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,My family enjoyed this.  Good story for the kiddos.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"Animation was phenomenal, and the story was very heartfelt. DreamWorks has been killing it lately with their releases."
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,All the kids loved it!
"Dec 22, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Story was bad, not for young kids and animation style seemed like a knock off of Spiderverse. Following trends and entirely mindless."
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,IT had interesting fairytale characters. All good.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,How can you not like a kitty in boots....tooo sweet.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,I very much enjoyed it.  It was funny and entertaining - fun for all ages!
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,The movie was super cute.  I dont understand why there had to be several random places with curse words.  Really??? Thanks for making my granddaughter ask why her movie was saying bad words.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Puss is cute as can be.  What can I say:  Good flick!
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Funny and cute little story that the kids will absolutely love.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Love this cat in boots :)
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Cute little flick! Kids loved it!!!
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Took my daughter and we both enjoyed it immensely.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"This is a very charming movie, particularly for the holidays. I strongly suggest 3-D"
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Great movie for whole family. Extremely well done.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,The best animation in 2022
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Brought the family to this one and everyone was really entertained.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"if you go see any long awaited sequel this Christmas, make damn sure that it's 'Puss in Boots: The Last Wish'. This movie goes back to the roots of the first 2 Shrek movies with all the dark humor, constant laugh out loud moments, and cussing (yes it's mostly censored but I'll take what I can get). I absolutely loved this movie and definitely will be seeing it again soon and probably more times then 'Avatar 2'."
"Dec 22, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Я думаю, што мульт немного понос, потому што тут нету пропаганды ЛГБТ типа хотелось бы что бы тут имелся полностью политкорректный гендерно нейтральный толерантный трансгендеро биполярный Q+ кот"
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"This is so good! It's funny, sharp, kind of edgy, has great action sequences, and a heartwarming story. The movie is quickly paced, nothing drags or seems unnecessary, and the characters are great. The wolf was a pleasant surprise, and my kids were engrossed the entire time. Absolutely loved it."
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Saw it twice already: the kids love it!
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"Good fun but very strange. Some scenes were too scary for my children ... and maybe me too haha. Puss, between Shrek and his prior movie, seems to push the reset button on his character growth each time as a slightly different version of himself that almost feels like a multiverse. Some moments, though cartoonish, felt eerily violent for kids. Some character designs were uncomfortably bizarre. The reason I still give it top marks is that it took me on a roller coaster of entertainment so I can really complain."
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Family movie that I recommend.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"This Movie was awesome! The animation was great, The characters were awesome and I absolutely love it."
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Boys and I loved it! Can't go wrong here with the little ones.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"I was wondering how they were going to play out his 9th life. The plot was easy to follow and the comedy was funny and witty. It was a touching story of what life truly is about. One life is better than 9 and don't forget to stop and smell the roses from time to time. The animation was great, as was the voice overs. I now have a new favorite character besides Pickles (aka Puss in Boots) it is now Perro!"
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"Good,Emotional, Fun,Awesome, I  cried with Goldilocks' Scenes"
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,My grandkids loved it!  Me too.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Even better than the first movie! Antonio Banderas is awesome!
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"A great addition to the adventures of the booted Puss, living up after the excellent Netflix series  As usual you get great story and action mixed with humor and character development."
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"Characteristic swashbuckling and silly fun you would expect from Puss N Boots, but also a surprising amount of heart. We really enjoyed this one."
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,My 7 yr old and I really enjoyed this movie.

"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Good family movie during the holidays.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,I laughed and cried and was touched by cute animals.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,My family and I went to see this movie. It was so funny and cute. We loved it!
"Dec 22, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Boring, and the theater was too cold"
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie. Well rounded characters, great story, and pacing. COMPLETE PACKAGE‼️😎"
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"I freaking love this movie. It is by far one of the best movies I have seen this year! It was better than I ever expected to be. The story was amazing, the characters were awesome, the action was insane, and so much more! This movie while for kids/family can be watched and enjoyed by adults. I definitely recommend to watch this movie!"
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,I went in with decently high expectations and honestly still came out pretty amazed.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,My kids enjoyed the movie.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Excellent film and a must watch
"Dec 22, 2022",NEGATIVE,Terrible movie. My grandson wouldn’t watch it
"Dec 22, 2022",NEGATIVE,The story line was all over the place it was depressing and certainly NOT for children
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Overall very good movie. Certain parts kind of dragged out but all in all it was a good movie. My son loves it so Im happy.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,it was cute my daughter loved it
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"It features a lot of style and emotion to keep it engaging throughout. The cast and visuals are top tier, but this unexpected character-driven story will bring Shrek fans joy."
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Very fun movie. Took my 12 year old daughter and 10 year old niece and they loved it. 
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"It was a great movie, my siblings and I love it. Animation is stunning, story book plot was really nice too with character development for puss. Death was a good touch as well as the rest of the characters in the story."
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Relived my childhood it was awesome
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"This was one for the books! this film was very family oriented and it stuck with the books and storytelling ! You can go sooo , friends and even family it’s all flit enjoy ! Better than the original."
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great animation, action and humor.  surprisingly heartfelt story lines.  Young children may be frightened by the wolf portraying Death, and may be too young to appreciate the story line.   Leave the kids home and go see it yourself!"
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,This is absolutely one of the best movies in the franchise. The animation was beautiful and the fights were amazing. The villain gave me chills. The movie gives you a great sense of how scared puss was. And You REALLY need to see the ending got me very hyped for what's in store ;)
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,My family really enjoyed the movie!!
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"A great peformance from the entire cast, a beautiful score that highlights Hispanic/Latin-American culture in a way that isn't forceful, a well-animated and lively environment, and fantastic writing. If you're looking to bring your elementary schooler to this movie, I'd say it's a little intense. If you're a vet and have PTSD you probably shouldn't see this movie either. A certain character might trigger some things. This serves as a beautiful teaser for Shrek 5, and does lots of character development for Puss and his inner-circle. Highly suggest - one of the best movies I've seen all year, to be honest."
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"The wolf is such a powerful character, the movie really pushes the medium of Animation past just a ""kid's movie"" generator. Well done DW"
"Dec 22, 2022",NEUTRAL,"For a kids movie it wasn't bad.  It doesn't teach any life lessons, it's just entertainment."
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"This movie is amazing, I had low to mid expectations for this movie and it absolutely surpassed it. The animation was great, the story was simple and predictable but very well executed. But what I love is the villain, the villain really gave me the creeps everytime he appears. The voice acting was perfect. It's just amazing."
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,The movie was really cute. I loved the messages in the movie and the storyline. The humor was also really good.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,the graphics were great! the storyline was awesome and the adult humor was funny yet discrete! loved it
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"Wow! This movie was absolutely beautiful and stunningly good. The animation, story, themes, characters, everything! So so good."
"Dec 22, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Cartoon movies arent my thing but my daughter wanted to see it, it was ok. Seen several cartoon movies with humor and they were good, this one. No humor. Boring. Anyone below the age of 10 might like it."
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"This movie was great the animation was Buitiful and reminded me of spiderman into the spiderverses art style and the way it did the story was like bullet train even though they were in production at the same time, great over all."
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,It was very funny  and great zingers.  It had suspense and adventure too.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"ITS SO BRIGHT AND ZANY!!!! the animation was Spiderverse levels of good, i love found family, the therpay dog was actually GOOD and not just annoying, goldilocks  there were too many storylines, so it was just right. second best movie of the year just behind Everything Everywhere All At Once"
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"A must see!!!  Shrek nostalgia, but more than that the storyline is touching."
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Very good movie would recommend.
"Dec 22, 2022",NEUTRAL,Funny family movie with great messages throughout.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Such a fun movie.  The story was really well done and the action sequences were done in a different animation style that gave it really good flavor.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,I thought it was cute and the animation was great! Great movie for kids as well as adults.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"Best in the franchise since Shrek 2 by a wide margin, the comedy is the sharpest I've seen from DreamWorks in years and it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that they still have as much fresh edge as they did from day 1. The animation is obviously inspired by Spiderverse, and it gives the film a sense of kinetic energy and striking spectacle that I was really hoping to see more of from the studio after the brilliant presentation of Bad Guys. The emotional beats accomplish their goals pretty well, especially when it comes to a certain family, but a little more depth to the main antagonist would have been appreciated to make the final confrontation feel a touch more meaningful. Overall, a fantastic movie that squashes all worries I had for the next steps that DreamWorks are shaping up to take in the Shrek franchise"
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,good music well done
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,good enough for adults to sit through and get laughs
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Sad happy scary 2000000/10 would watch again loved it
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Enjoyed this with the family.  It's a really sweet flick.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"The movie was absolutely incredible, art style was refreshing, pacing was on point, not a super long movie. Felt engaged the entire time, every progression within the story made sense. Super duper funny jokes, and the side dog was not annoying at all. loved the backstory between kitty soft paws and puss. The absolute BEST part of the movie was the Death Wolf, as the horror aspect that he brought was insanely good. Please go watch this movie."
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"yes, some of the action may be a little intense for some kids depending on what they're used to. but, I really enjoyed the show. the animation was unique and different. and the meaning behind the parable was Rock Solid"
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Was a very good show for all ages
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,It was an absolutely must see movie of 2022 loved the movie.
"Dec 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Great family movie over the holidays.
"Dec 21, 2022",NEGATIVE,The animation was choppy and not as clean as Shrek movies as if they just threw it together and rushed it for release.
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,Very good movie funny from beginning to end
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"Very good story, beautifully executed animation and had me laughing multiple times"
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,My Grandkids loved it!
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,Very good would watch again 
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"A surprisingly mature and enjoyable film in a medium that has seen widespread mediocrity as of late, 𝘗𝘶𝘴𝘴 𝘪𝘯 𝘉𝘰𝘰𝘵𝘴: 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘓𝘢𝘴𝘵 𝘞𝘪𝘴𝘩 sticks out like a pie dipped thumb."
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"The animation is spectacular and the action was top-notch.

And it has a meaningful story of cherishing the one life that you have... This has to be one of my favorite animated movies of the year!"
"Dec 21, 2022",NEGATIVE,"The animation for this story, as simplistic as it was, doesn’t work for me. It was nice to see Puss in Boots again but the animation and story didn’t do much for me. The humor worked at times but overall nothing memorable for me."
"Dec 21, 2022",NEGATIVE,Movie is too long. Scary for small children
"Dec 21, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I really enjoyed this follow up to Puss in Boots.  Voices of the cast were great.  My favorites were of course Puss, Kitty Softpaw and Perrito.  Themes of love, family and belonging were weaved into the story.  There were some humor as well.  Perrito's character steals the show. Though he's an animated character, he's lovable."
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,It was a bit on the dark side not really the happy movie I expected but it was worth the watch for a older group may be a bit scary for really small children. Alot of death talked about . Alot of witchcraft.
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"This film mixes great comedy, great action, really unique visualls and a really good story."
"Dec 21, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Just plain awful. My family and I loved ice age, shrek etc….  This movie is not worth your money or donation of the time of your life to watch it."
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,I still can't believe this is a pg film even though it has cusses and it doesn't make it better that is beeped but good movie
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"I took my 9-year-old granddaughter to see the movies first showing at a local theater.  Not normally impressed with kid movies, but this was actually pretty good.  My granddaughter was even telling me about the things that the movie was trying to get across to the viewers.  By far the best of the five movies we saw together in 2022"
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"superb, this is the kind of thing Animation was meant for"
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"I was not expecting to sit down to an animated reboot and love it so much. The cast was brilliant and the story was so touching and HILARIOUS. Well done, folks."
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"Simply wonderful. I had a big smile on my, uh, puss from start to finish..."
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"This movie was absolutely epic, smdefinite must-see especially if you liked the first Puss in Boots"
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,Perfect movie from start to finish.
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"Wonderful, Colorful and very Funny! An all around Family Movie! Can’t wait to see it again!"
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"This Probably might be the best animated film this year! Dreamworks is  back! Like puss in boots this franchise and dreamworks in general has nine lives as well! Fun, funny and shockingly adult in tone in all the good ways possible."
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"The kids already want to see it again, so there you go."
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,The grandkids loved it!
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,All the kid enjoyed this and so did I.
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,Cute tale :)  Good family movie.
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,Good for families. Enjoyed!
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,The film is a masterpiece to the animation to the writing. Humor for all ages it doesn't pander to children. When people say this is the Logan in the Shrek series they aren't lying. A story about death love and team friendship.
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,Purfect movie and lots of laughs!
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,prety kity😁🤠🥰🤩😍
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,Cute flick!  Highly recommend to see.
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,Loved it! Leaves you smiling :)
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"What an adventure! New fun characters, wonderful animation, and a unique story make this film worthy of the titular legend feline. 

I really appreciate the characters, especially two outstanding villain characters (Arguably, some of the best to come from the studio ever), no spoilers. There was no character I didn't like, which is a rarity. It was also very funny at times, I even had to hold back laughter in the theater. 

The art style, especially the backgrounds, reminds me of the original way the settings were done by hand painting on animated films such as Disney's Bambi (1942). This film brings back such artistic styles which founded animation; Styles that have been replaced and critically forgotten over the last few decades. It is a similar animation style to that in Spiderman: Into The Spiderverse (2018), yet it was more painting-like and less comic book-like. It truly did make me feel as if I was inside a fairytale world.

Addressing some fellow audience critiques, one villain in particular definitely sent chills down my spine when he appeared, enough so that any child might want to advert eyes for a second or two. This is a true villain character. It is important to recognize that even if a villain may be scary, that is the point. As far as that kind of villain being in a movie with children in mind, if you think about it over the years films have lacked such despicable characters, especially looking back at some earlier animation films from big studios including Disney. Therefore, this really shouldn't be a factor in limiting any child to see this film under your advisement (It is PG for this reason). 

After seeing this unexpectedly great film, I wouldn't be opposed to a sequel or other future films, especially with the same style as in this film. Perhaps even, this is further motivation to prepare for the 5th installment in a particular franchise in the same universe."
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,Loved puss with an attitude.  Give it a shot!
"Dec 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"I'm a lover of cats, and this was too cute!"
"Dec 20, 2022",POSITIVE,Kids and I could see this one again!
"Dec 20, 2022",POSITIVE,"The best of the ""shrek"" franchise so far. And one of the best-animated films in years hands down."
"Dec 20, 2022",POSITIVE,Cute movie. We all had lots of laughs.
"Dec 20, 2022",POSITIVE,Family movie.  You can't go wrong with.
"Dec 20, 2022",POSITIVE,Purrrfect movie.  My family loved it!
"Dec 20, 2022",POSITIVE,"From the unique, visually captivating animation to the stylistic takes on classic storybook characters, this film provides a pleasurable and engaging journey for the senses. It features a narrative that tackles darker themes such as anxiety and death in a fresh, digestible manner, whilst delivering a simple—yet important!—message that anyone can relate to. Overall, it's a good time and a worthwhile watch for any animation fan."
"Dec 20, 2022",POSITIVE,"Awesome animation and story. We've been waiting too long for something like this from the Shrek universe. Come on, we want another movie like this!"
"Dec 20, 2022",POSITIVE,This is a family favorite already.  Thumbs up!
"Dec 20, 2022",POSITIVE,"Highly recommended that you watch this movie--Highly! Personally a 10/10 may sound exaggerated, but I think that's a fair rating. What the hell is bad with this movie?"
"Dec 20, 2022",POSITIVE,Fun family flick!  It won't disappoint.
"Dec 20, 2022",POSITIVE,Puss is too cute!  Kids loved it!!!
"Dec 19, 2022",POSITIVE,Cute flick!  Kids can get enough of this character.
"Dec 19, 2022",POSITIVE,You guys have to go watch it
"Dec 19, 2022",POSITIVE,Fantastic film that really took me off guard. Did not expect to see the level of depth and character building that was put on show. This movie proves that Puss can be more than just a basic ladies man and adrenaline junky. Highly recommend!
"Dec 19, 2022",POSITIVE,"Of course, it is need to watch cartoon again, but for the first time, the film is fun and tears.  An absolutely beautifully told story, the heroes of which you sympathize with and experience their grief and happiness with them.
 The film touches on very deep topics, which it is not afraid to reflect on and bring these thoughts to the end.
 The visual is incredible, made in the spirit of our time, which does not prevent cartoon from combining elements into an exciting picture level.
 * If to mention a few words about the Shrek franchise, then this film has an indirect relation to it, which is pleasantly surprising and gives additional disclosure to the characters.  The cartoon is independent and it would be good to see more such cartoons in the future, it is for them to give money in cinemas."
"Dec 19, 2022",POSITIVE,"Fun, funny and profound.  A lot of good life messages thrown in."
"Dec 18, 2022",POSITIVE,LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Dec 18, 2022",POSITIVE,"This movie is amazing, from the plot to the animation. Not only do they make multiple refrences to the previous movie and several fairy tales but they also give old characters who could arguably be considered plain and unevolved across the movie more personality, as they play into their fears and make them see life (or death) in some cases as it really is. Overall this movie is a masterpiece and i hope you will enjoy it if you do decide to watch it!"
"Dec 18, 2022",POSITIVE,"Amazing animation, great action scenes, round and interesting characters with believable arcs, and a true villain to be scared of. The best animation to come out at 2022, and it's not the one James Cameron made."
"Dec 17, 2022",POSITIVE,Brilliant. We have two cats just like Puss and Softpaws. Laughed cried and had a great time we weren't exactly expecting. There are some scary scenes for the under 5's but the rest will be okay for kids of school age. Fast paced full on fun.
"Dec 17, 2022",POSITIVE,"No cappa this movie was pretty bangaranging, great to watch with the boys but the ending was pretty average ngl."
"Dec 17, 2022",POSITIVE,"Hands down one of the best movies (not even just kids movies) of the year. The animation and art are stunning and deserve to be seen on the big screen. The story, audio, characters and humour are surprisingly mature and written so well. I absolutely loved it and would definately go again with my little one, but grown ups can appreciate it too. I honestly would say its dreamworks's best movie by a mile"
"Dec 16, 2022",POSITIVE,"A fun, enjoyable film for audiences of all ages. The animation style of Puss In Boots makes the cinematic experience all the more enjoyable and the adult humor always makes a kid's movie that much better."
"Dec 15, 2022",POSITIVE,These movies are always incredible.
"Dec 15, 2022",POSITIVE,"It really brought me back to the Shrek's serie mood. The animation is really beautiful, and the main villain.... just stunning, his presence on screen is incredible. As for the humor, loved it, the musics, great ! and the ending..."
"Dec 15, 2022",POSITIVE,The only good thing of this movie is the character Perrito in the all plot he helping cat in the moments when he goes to into a cardiac arrest perrito tries to calm him down and this y love so much
"Dec 15, 2022",POSITIVE,"One of the best animated movies I've seen in recent years. Pacing is excellent, and the characters are lovely and memorable. I watched in 2D and the animation is already an absolute treat, would probably look even better in 3D. Tugs at the heartstrings and gives amazing character development to every character that needed it. Excellent movie, would watch it again."
"Dec 15, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Perfectly fine DreamWorks movie, worth the watch, but I probably won't be going back for more."
"Dec 14, 2022",POSITIVE,Loved it. It was amazing even brought back my memories from childhood. I suggest everyone to watch this one.Mark Swift did a really good job on this one.
"Dec 14, 2022",POSITIVE,A really good movie. Would recommend watching it.
"Dec 14, 2022",POSITIVE,Best animated film of the year! Exceeds all expectations with outstanding animation and story.
"Dec 14, 2022",POSITIVE,"One of the best animated movies of this year along side with Turning Red and Guillermo del Toro's Pinoccio.

And absolute masterpiece that doesn't rely on just being a sequel. This movie spoke to me as it will do to many people without feeling that it is ""trying to hard"" and that's because the conflicts presented feel real."
"Dec 13, 2022",NEGATIVE,"too dark, too scary, too much"
"Dec 13, 2022",POSITIVE,"Charming animation, charming characters, and an overall fantastic movie for Dreamworks. It's been a while since we've seen a number of good movies of Dreamworks in a single sitting. Things are looking up for them."
"Dec 13, 2022",POSITIVE,"A fun and absolutely wonderful and delightful movies I've watched this year, if you didn't watch this, I don't know what the hell you're waiting for! It's a blast and I was delighted."
"Dec 13, 2022",POSITIVE,"I was a little skeptical to see this movie because I'm not a huge fan of animated movies, but I'm definitely glad I gave it a try. It's hilarious, action-packed, and the visuals are surprisingly cool as hell. I definitely recommend taking your family or friends!!"
"Dec 13, 2022",NEUTRAL,death is the movies's goat
"Dec 13, 2022",POSITIVE,"I was a little disappointed with the first Puss in Boots. I thought it was OK, A shame because Puss In Boots was my favourite character in Shrek 2. However I thought Puss in Boots 2 was way better. Like with Terrifer 2 & Top Gun Maverick, this is a movie sequel that is better than the sequel. Definitely the best animated movie this year"
"Dec 12, 2022",POSITIVE,Zorro did what was needed.
"Dec 12, 2022",POSITIVE,"Believe me when I said this movie shocked me with how good it was.
I went into the theatre not expecting much but the way the story played out was amazing. Without giving out too much spoilers, I would like to say the characters are well written and overall the story was funny, touching and really amazing. 100% recommend 

p.s. I loved the wolf"
"Dec 11, 2022",POSITIVE,"It's always amazing to enjoy an animated movie that's capable of mixing comedy, remarkable voice acting and dramatic background, touching deep topics such as death or how life's purpose and value should be treasured is what gave this movie the recognition and positive feedback that it's getting, the animation was incredible and it was a more than welcome addition to the shrek universe as part of a ""new Dreamworks era"", if this is how the future coming movies are gonna be developed i'm all here for this quality!"
"Dec 11, 2022",POSITIVE,"Wow, this was an incredible come-back for Dreamworks after many bad movies, hope Shrek 5 has the same quality level."
"Dec 11, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great action, and a touching story. Puss in Boots is one of the best movies to come out this year."
"Dec 11, 2022",POSITIVE,"I think it was the most fucking amazing experience and its slitly better than the original
Please make another one amazing work!"
"Dec 10, 2022",POSITIVE,It was a very good movie the wolf was so scary
"Dec 10, 2022",POSITIVE,I was a little unsure of how the spin off from Shrek would work. Absolutely brilliant. Just see ot
"Dec 10, 2022",POSITIVE,I love the Puss in Boots series. The new 3d models they used in this sequel are much better than the old ones which were realistic to the point of being mildly off-putting. It has a great story that viewers of all ages can enjoy and I didn't find it overwhelmingly corny.
"Dec 10, 2022",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie, post credit scene of Shrek was epic!"
"Dec 10, 2022",POSITIVE,THEY SHOULD MAKE A 3RD ONE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Dec 9, 2022",POSITIVE,Best movie ever! You would not believe how much I enjoyed it!

"Dec 9, 2022",POSITIVE,"Not only did this movie have extremely satisfying visuals and on-point soundtrack, but the story was absolutely epic, the characters were extremely likeable (yes, even the villains) and, most of all, it actually teaches you some very good life lessons. 10/10, absolute must-see, hope for cinema is not lost after all."
"Dec 8, 2022",POSITIVE,"A true masterpiece sequel and the best DreamWorks Animation film, since How to Train Your Dragon and Shrek 2."
"Dec 7, 2022",POSITIVE,looks great cant wait!
"Dec 7, 2022",NEGATIVE,L movie puss in boots needs to get rid of his diabetes

"Dec 7, 2022",POSITIVE,Best DreamWorks movie since the How To Train Your Dragon franchise with a crazy unexpected surprise for Shrek fans.
"Dec 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,Super disappointing. We almost fell asleep at the start. Big Bad Wolf expected to fight with Puss but walked away. Huge disappointment.
"Dec 4, 2022",POSITIVE,stunning animation mixing 2D and 3D and making the movie very pleasent to watch. every character is really lovable. the wolf got a fearful presence that is so unique! absolutely loved the character design of him and of goldilocks and the three bears. the brazilian voice dub is perfect. this movie got my attention from beggining to the end and i will watch it again for sure.
"Dec 4, 2022",POSITIVE,Excellent movie of family which is more important than personal wishes!

"Nov 29, 2022",POSITIVE,We need more Shrek movies after this especially Madagascar 4

"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,really really cute movie. i originally watched it with some friends to make fun of it (i am indeed a worthless teenager) but it was honestly really entertaining. i'm obviously not the key demographic but i definitely want to take my family to see it
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,One of the best animated films I have ever watched. It takes a darker tone and explores many characteristics of death. An absolute must see!
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,The animation and the story is so good.
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Fresh story, minimal call backs.  Adult and kids both will like it."
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots The Last Wish is not only the best animated movie of this year, but one of my favorite movies this year. For starters the animation style is fucking fantastic. Its a mix of 3D and 2D animation that just looks amazing. The action and movement of the camera is also just outstanding, I was in awe of how good this movie looked. Obviously Puss in Boots was a great character but even the supporting characters are a blast to watch. Probably the biggest surprise tho was the story and how mature it was for a kids movie. Its themes and emotions were just so damn good given how Puss in Boots is on his last life. Overall this movie was everything Id hoped and more."
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,The movie was incredible and the visuals was amazing different colors through out the movie and the development of the main character and relationships
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great entertaining, action packed and funny animated movie. My 6 year old enjoyed the movie a lot. I went with very low expectations and it turned out to be one of the best animated movie that I have seen since 2020 with sharp script and fantastic chases."
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,What a blast! Fun and clever!! Gives all the feels! Loved it!!!
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,The visuals were absolutely astounding. The storyline was digestible and the drive behind Puss' motivation fit in incredibly well with the conflict. Nice post-credit.
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"#PussInBootsTheLastWish spoiler-free review:
Surprisingly amazing, unexpectedly superior to the 1st, more deeper & emotional, and makes our characters more fleshed developed than expected, w/ serious stakes, unexpected adult humor, and a creative SpiderVerse-inspired animation style. Best film in the #Shrek universe. Can't wait for #Shrek5. 😉
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Loved the story and the villains!
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Phenomenally shot, visually stunning, and cleverly written. One of the best animated films to release in the last few years. Go see this when it comes out!"
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Phenomenally made, gorgeous animation, and breathtaking story. See this when it releases!"
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Incredible film! Even better than the first Puss movie! I cannot wait to go see it again! Perrito and the Wolf were amazing! I need more of them!
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,An emotionally driven story that kept both children and parents entertained. A stand alone spin-off that still kept the humor of the original story. The animation was mostly amazing but sometimes shifted into the realm of a choppy anime style film. We did like and dislike the masking of adult language (at least the kids did). We would watch again.
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Got to see a special, early advance screening of #PussInBoots: The Last Wish and it was ... excellent! More voice acting gold from Antonio Banderas, STUNNING visuals (took me a second to get used to it, but really dig this style), and a story that well-explores surprisingly mature themes via a wildly enjoyable fairy tale-fueled adventure. Bonus ❤️ for Perrito & Ethical Bug.

Review: Part 2 - Puss in Boots: The Last Wish was a much better movie than what I thought it was going to be. The movie really does start to step back into the Shrek roots and the animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to pull the feelings into the occurring character development. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a solid return to the world that began in Shrek and features great voice-acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for one wild ride."
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,This was better than the first Puss In Boots by miles. The animation and voice acting were amazing. Every new character from Perito to the Bears stood out. Some of the imagery was beautiful. Very funny. A message you don’t see executed well in family media is very well done here. One of Dreamworks’ best. The hot streak continues! 10/10
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"I loved the plot and the characters. The emotional depth of the story was well portrayed and I liked the discovery all the characters experienced towards the climax of the film. I thought the scary parts were too scary for the age group that was in the theater, certainly for my kids but there wasn't too many scary parts. Two characters deserve some criticism, I didn't care for big Jack at all, his physical size was off and didn't quite fit in with the rest of the movie and the wolf, whom I loved, i thought his character was for a much older audience as even the subject of death was a bit much for my kids."
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,This is such a cute and fun movie for the whole family! A beautifully done edition to the Shrek universe.  Unique animation style and new fary tale story!
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"This was a pleasure to see. As someone who commonly finds animated children-friendly movies lacking, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing at well-executed punchlines and invested in the characters. Where the first movie a decade ago lagged, this one zoomed. Also, the music was great and I was disappointed that I couldn't find the intro theme anywhere online after seeing the film this afternoon. See it if you're debating!"
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,The movie was great! held my kids attention from beginning to end. There were parts where my 6 year old got a little scared but nothing inappropriate for a 6 year old. I would recommend this movie for the whole family.
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Easily better than the 1st and the animation is God-tier perfection. Perrito is a scene stealing comedic genius and Goldi & the 3 Bears deserve their own spinoff. While they most of the jokes play it safely, Dreamworks Animation has entered its Renaissance era."
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"The movie is the best of all, especially when Perrito swears and beeps, which is very similar to Merton from DC League of Super-Pets."
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"It was a great movie!!! I thought it was better than the first movie. I was a little hesitant on the change of animation, but it actually wasn't to bad. I really enjoyed it and so did my kids."
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"The movie was a bit choppy and fast-paced at first, but once the villains are introduced and the plot is set in motion it gets really entertaining. The animation was phenomenal, and the voice acting and sound were superb. The music both vocal and instrumental worked really well with the movie. I really enjoyed Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, it was well worth the wait to return to the Shrek Universe."
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Just saw the opening day theater pre-screening. Phenomenal meowy-wowey work of art. This sequel is surprisingly better than the first from a decade ago. I absolutely like this movie, especially the hero characters, so much that I wish they were real so I could meet and talk with them. Being a cat photographer at local animal shelters, I particularly appreciated the scenes of mucho cats at the crazy cat lady's rescue home where poor Puss ended up in, and a subtle revelation by Kitty Soft Paws on the sadness of having declawed paws. I want to see this movie again, and again...and again."
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Entertaining for both kids and adults. Action packed and hilarious. A must see!
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"An absolute family masterpiece. My family and I loved this movie. The animation was amazing, the jokes were hilarious, and the fight scenes were beautiful. This movie was amazing and I would strongly recommend bringing your family to see Puss in Boots: The last wish."
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Great movie made very well!
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Loved it! Gives you a great time at  the theaters.
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"fantastic animation style with stunning action sequences and beautifully colored moments. emotion was well done on all fronts and while the story may have been somewhat predictable for the older audience, this would be a fantastic watch for the younger kids. nonetheless, the story is enjoyable for everyone. also, the wolf was animated extremely well and its fearful aura was some of the best I've seen in an animated format"
"Nov 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish achieved what very few animated sequels to a spinoff have done: Accelerate forward in every way shape in form. I love the combo of 2D and 3D Animation here, the new characters are memorable, the action reminded me a lot of Into the Spider-verse, and the overall moral is actually pretty effective. Only negative, It can get a bit cliche in a few places.

Definitely recommend this when it officially releases in a few weeks 

8.5/10 Stars"
"Nov 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"With its darker tone and some adult words and humor, it may be a bit much for a younger audience. Though it's a bit more mature it is still heart warming and really hilarious. I found myself laughing out more then I care to admit. My 7 year old absolutely loved it. All in all good movie for the family."

"Nov 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Must see with your kids, too funny"
"Nov 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Made it to the sneak preview and Puss and Boots and The Last Wish is a pleasant surprise of a sequel thats equally entertaining for children and adults. The premise and storyline is very deep for a family animated movie which will keep the parents consistently engaged. Coming to grips with evolving over time as an individual along with those you share your life with that value you and appreciating them as family and/or friends is a very profound lesson that can resonate with kids and adults whether in first view or many times afterwards with this well made movie. Just as good if not, better than the original. "
"Nov 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Puss is back in action! The cast was outstanding, the visuals were beautiful, the music went hard, and THE ANIMATION THOUGH!!!! Had that gloss of Into the Spider-verse animation, which I love so much! 10/10. One of the best animated films of the year!"
"Nov 26, 2022",POSITIVE,We liked when Death showed us his pearly whites. We like when Puss n Boots and Death walked through the fire
"Nov 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"This story of puss in boots was great. Lots of laughs for the kids and adults in true Shrek fashion. Great new characters and some backstory on some that we already know. Some parts seem a little slow at times, but overall a great movie to take the family to see."
"Nov 26, 2022",POSITIVE,It was really great except there was a lot of kids
