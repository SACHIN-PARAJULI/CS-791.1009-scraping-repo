"Apr 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"So dumb, bad acting, predictable, dumb... Like really dumb."
"Apr 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"It is an obvious Seven Samurai Sci Fi ripoff. Seven Samurai is an be if my all time favorites,  and this movie does it justice. The visual effects are outstanding and the creatures are some of the best ever. I am very pleased that I turned this on."
"Apr 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Characters are too dull,too many unnecessary scenes that tried to look cool. No chemistry among the ""rebels"". With all the scifi movies and series being released recently, this one seems outdated in terms of themes and direction. 10 year old kids would love this though."
"Apr 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,Another star wars imitation gone wrong . When the girl brought the bird back to life I just had to laugh. What the flip is this üò≠
"Apr 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,One of the worst movies I've ever wasted time watching. Comical how bad this was.
"Apr 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Visually it's a very impressive film. Lots of great sci-fi action sequences and the slow-mo fight scenes are pretty fun to watch. However, the overall story feels pretty generic and bland. The main characters literally just go on a fetch-quest for bunch of people that they've heard of who can help them on their journey, watch as they demonstrate some kind of badass ability or fight, and then they join the group. That's pretty much it up to the end fight against the main villain which was also pretty underwhelming. While it has its fun moments, overall it falls pretty flat. Let's hope part 2 coming up soon expands the story and makes up for the lack of substance in part 1."
"Apr 9, 2024",POSITIVE,I'm impressed with the bad reviews...I loves this series. I thing was amazing!
"Apr 8, 2024",POSITIVE,Everything star wars still wishes it was!! Absolutely brilliant movie!
"Apr 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie was great.  Not perfect but great.  Funny, expansive, world building, familiar but not a duplicate.  It was FUN...remember when movies were sometimes just entertaining and FUN?  When everything did not have to be a shakesperean or orwellian masterpiece and it could just be loud and entertaining and scary and funny and diverting and FUN...well it was."
"Apr 7, 2024",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed the show nd can't wait for part 2
"Apr 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was rushed and had the most generic charachters. And the big finale didn't make any sense. A Dreadnought that literally leveled planets a minute before gets defeated by a guy with a spear.
"Apr 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was nice break from reality which all this type of movie needs to be. Looking forward to part 2.

If you're expecting cinematic greatness go watch Citizen Kane or Ben Hur."
"Apr 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"I knew nothing about this movie before I stumbled on it. Wow! Love the story, love the perfectly cast characters. It is a great action adventure movie. Not long before I hit pause to Google who the director is. No surprise. I've watched it twice and will watch it again."
"Apr 3, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Rebel moon has rich visual storytelling. The opening scene with the narrative of an empirical world who destroyed their planet and the tragedy that forced the loss of their Monarchy, teasing treachery, and political intrigue and strife while introducing an indomitably cruel and sadistic minor antagonist who is but a pawn for the final Villain antagonist directing things from the shadows is an ominous launching point for the story.  

The protragonist, Kora, later to be revealed to be a girl in hiding by another name has an intricately complicated relationship with the final Villain antagonist which only strengthens the plot surrounding her journey to gather individuals to her cause that could defeat this indomitable foe.

Her journey however, begins on a planet as a simple farmer, but we soon learn what she is and her intricate background soon reveals itself in narrative and action as well as her knowledge of how to deal with the newcomers to the planet Veldt, which to the imminent peril of the inhabitants of Veldt is largely ignored. 

The history of the story at times is spoken in narratives to move the story along, but this seems to be due to the time limits placed on the story, which sits roughly at 2 hours and 16 minutes. It could have been an 8 hour show, filling with  expansive descriptive storytelling about the people, the universe and the cultures.

The actual narratives accompanied by flashbacks are rich with historical significance and recognizable symbolism, and has all the action packed nuance of previous Zack Snyder works with well choreographed fight scenes that move the story in references to previous scenes, and expansion of the influence of powers in the universe. These action scenes also offer supplemental knowledge to the dialogue revealing strengths, weaknesses and experience of characters that help you understand who they are, where they came from and why they are there. 

This first installment is an incredible introduction into a rich and vibrant universe that has the potential to become more than just the story that's told, and I look forward to future installments that continue to create a more vibrant painting of a universe, it's politics and it's people who live within it.

With incredible performances by Sofia Boutella (Star Trek: Beyond, The Kingsman: the Secret Service) , Djimon Hounsou (Gladiator, Guardians of the Galaxy, A Quiet Place  part II), Ray Fisher (Justice League, The piano Lesson) , Anthony Hopkins (The Silence of the Lambs, The Father, One Life, The Mask of Zorro) and many more."
"Apr 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"When they walked into a bar full of weird aliens and then immediately picked a fight, I told my wife that if they walked out with a guy who had a spaceship to take them to the next place then we were turning it off.  So.  I don't know what actually happened because I had to be true to my word."
"Apr 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It's like it was supposed to be a short series, with back stories and subplots, but instead we just get little episodes of characters that have meaningless background.

Cool action scenes but a bit over choreographed.

Setting changes were jarring and haphazard.

And the final scene was completely unnecessary.

Always good to see my boy Charlie Hunnam."
"Apr 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"It wasn't as bad as they say but beautiful visually and we shouldn't forget that 2nd part will also come, so just wait and watch."
"Apr 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Nice ! Entertaiment !
"Mar 31, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Rebel Moon starts off quite well but then the actors starting acting and things go WAY DOWN from there. There's also the immense issue with cinematography which is all over the place, not bringing the characters to life...and many many parts of the story feel cheap and hollow.

I WILL NOT be watching Part 2!"
"Mar 31, 2024",POSITIVE,Still enjoyed it thoroughly despite faults.
"Mar 30, 2024",POSITIVE,"Action packed, top notch special effects. Zack has done it again."
"Mar 30, 2024",NEUTRAL,Plot is messy acting is okay. Too many slow take action scenes. But it's a solid movie.
"Mar 28, 2024",POSITIVE,This was entertaining.
"Mar 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,Dreadful. This is why the DC universe was buried. Watch this then watch Dune for a real contrast in film making.
"Mar 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,Two hours of not caring
"Mar 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Very predictable storyline. 

Too many cliche characters and introductions of characters with a constant use of average fight scenes to build a connection instead of a compelling narrative. 

Can't go 5minutes without something being in slow mo diminishing actual important/cool parts"
"Mar 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,Why do they have electronic doors but do the rest by hand?! After this guy has this griffin ride I had enough.
"Mar 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Could be cool, we'll see if a poor rating from most viewers kills this franchise where it started."
"Mar 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Yes, the dialogue is cheesy. Yes, we've seen all the tropes portrayed in this movie before. Yes, the slo-mo was gratuitous. However, the story itself was relatively original, most shots were beautiful, and there's enough familiarity for any sci-fi/fantasy fan to just lock in and be entertained for a few hours. It may not be groundbreaking but it's still a good time and worth a watch if you enjoy the genre. Don't expect to be blown away by any twists or completely original ideas. Instead, enjoy it for what it is: a fun movie with some original creature designs and a classic good vs. space Nazis plot."

Minha opini√£o: Resumo √© um Star Wars de 2¬™ classe. Existe um Imperio que domina a Galaxia. Que o seu l√≠der imagina existir um grupo de rebelde e envia Noble no confins da gal√°xia para conter. Porem o planeta que ele vai √© um planeta agr√≠cola onde tem um povoado. Porem Noble tras terror a aquele planeta. E  l√° tamb√©m tem Kora, uma jovem, que esconde algo maior, mas quando ela v√™ uma jovem sendo molestada entra em a√ß√£o e tem a ajuda do androide. Ela sabendo que seria eliminada resolve sair do planeta e conhece Kai e assim resolvem formar um grupo rebelde e v√£o de local em local buscar outros integrantes. Nemesis, Titus, Gunnar,... At√© o momento que est√£o recrutando um exercito. Aparece Noble e neste momento descobre que eiste um traidor, quem ser√°? At√© que sonseguem fugir da emboscada. Os efeitos s√£o bons, interpreta√ß√µes medianas, mas nada que traga de novidade, pois √© um roteiro que j√° conhecemos. Lembra um pouco Han Solo. E temos o rob√¥ que acredito que no 2¬∫ filme tenha uma atua√ß√£o maior. Pois aqui ele ganha vida pr√≥pria.
Roteiro e enredo como j√° descrevi Classe B.
Vale apena assistir? Humm Se voc√™ j√° assistiu, Star Wars, voc√™ se desasmpotar√°. N√£o que seja p√©ssimo, simplemente e classe B.
Nota: 6"
"Mar 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely abysmal, from beginning to end, with laughable action scenes, card board cut out characters, and the plot my 11 year old self would have written."
"Mar 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Just a meh! I didn't really liked the main character...
"Mar 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Why introduce man taming griffin when it won't even be of use later.
"Mar 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Honestly, considering how much money and effort was obviously poured into this movie, it is one of the worst things I've ever watched. There are one or two okay action scenes, but even those suffer from being overproduced and pointlessly self indulgent. I wish they'd get rid of all the slow motion; maybe then they'd have enough time for an actual story. Terrible dreck, but if you are a fan of bad movies a la MST3K there is solid material for riffing here. Reminds me of Battlefield Earth."
"Mar 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,This was nothing more than a pretty collection of tropes.
"Mar 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Solid scifi movie with tons of emotion, a good (if not tried and true) storyline, and one that takes itself seriously in a good way."
"Mar 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great movie of every movie iv seen so far in my lifetime‚Ä¶ This movie along with the scott ridley's alien series with prometheus are thee best. I wonder why it only has a low rating, do people not know what is good and bad??‚Ä¶ All i can say is thank you Zack and cant wait to see the 2nd part of Rebel Moon!"
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,I loved the movie and cast and excited for the second one.
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,I just find it boring. It just drags on. And then teases a part 2. But I don't care enough about the story or the clich√© characters to want to sit through a sequel.
"Mar 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The story is borrowed from quite a few different sources, so I felt like I'd seen the movie several times before in some form or another. The fight scenes weren't very well done, the slow motion they're shot in looked to me as if they were trying to hide how bad they were, but eventually made them look worse. 

I do give kudos to the worldbuilding visuals, they were awesome."
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,While it has some good visuals everything else was just off. I found myself struggling to pay attention and the overabundance of slow-motion sequences was downright exhausting.
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie was in the same category as The Perils of Gwendolyn in the Land of the Yic Yak, which I saw on the recommendation of a 16 year old video store clerk 35 years ago. Lol.so that makes it the second worst movie I have ever seen. I did force myself to finish it."
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The movie had a good idea, but it looks like they couldn't implement their idea. Even though it's visually brilliant and a good idea. The plot doesn't stick together, the characters are largely flat. To sum up, it was a waste of time"
"Mar 16, 2024",POSITIVE,I really don't understand the hate. I agree it's not totally original but I was entertained. Looking forward to seeing the second half and the R rated versions.
"Mar 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Yet another Seven Samurai ""retelling"", this time as written by an apparent 15 year old who wanted to incorporate every Sci-Fi and Anime character they ever encountered."
"Mar 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I could only manage 25 minutes of this, it is SO bad, it was awful! truly terrible, pacing was incredibly slow, characters were all people I wish they would all kill one another to save me the pain of watching any more, I just couldn't take it anymore after 25 minutes, thanks, but no thanks"
"Mar 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Quand on conna√Æt le montant qu'√† co√ªt√© le film et le r√©sultat a l'√©cran. Les effets sp√©ciaux sont parfois tellement risibles et les acteurs jouent si mal que c'est une perte de temps et que des millions de $ ont √©t√© d√©pens√© pour un travail b√¢cl√©.
"Mar 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I have no idea why people equate it with a star wars rip off. It seemed much more like a Chronicle of Riddick missed with bad Amime like One Piece. Input Vin Diesel in the main character and boom same thing. It's visually good, but world building was rushed and clearly made to be 3 movies, not one that stands on its own."
"Mar 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"An absolute mess, boring and had really bad acting."
"Mar 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"I really enjoy this film. The colors, tone and pace. Excited to see the directors cut and then part 2."
"Mar 13, 2024",POSITIVE,Seeing as all the reviews seem to be terrible I have to say I am very surprised by that. I found the movie to be very good as I am not one to usually watch sci-fi movies my father turned it on while playing board games and I surprisingly was drawn to it instantly. I think the main issue now days is people not being able to understand some movies aren't for them and instead of giving feedback of pros/cons it's a constant attack against the director and actors/actresses. Excited for part two.
"Mar 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,"some good materials, a real potential but it would deserve more screen time to go into details. A series format would have been more appropriate"
"Mar 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Zack stara siƒô zrobiƒá nowe star wars, tylko s≈Çabsze, nudniejsze, i bezsensowne. 
≈öwiat przedstawiony jest absurdalny, fabu≈Ça to ciƒÖg nudnych ekspozycji, same efekty nie≈∫le, ale ju≈º og√≥lna warstwa wizualna ≈õrednia, do tego nadu≈ºywanie slow-mo."
"Mar 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"Way better than your stupid plastic Star Wars.
Seems to be mockery of every bit of sci-fi movies for the last decade or two."
"Mar 8, 2024",POSITIVE,Awesome popcorn si fi flick. Can't wait till next. Harsh critics can go fly a kite!
"Mar 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"As someone who had nothing to do with the making of the film I thought it was a fun new adventure something That wasn't already an established Franchise. Like all the garbage That comes out of the Disney franchises These days that everybody seems to want to compare everything else to as if there some kind of masterpiece. That being said this movie is not immune to some hiccups.
 But I was entertained swept up into the universe, Love the cast And the special effects. I was Away from the world's problems for a few hours And enjoyed it, which is at its core. What entertainment is supposed to do i look forward
 To part 2."
"Mar 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I'm just not sure why this needed to be made, it felt like the plot for a video game from the early 2000s. Everything felt rather flat and uninspired and there were too many characters and not enough development or performance to make me care about any of them."
"Mar 7, 2024",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed watching and am looking forward to the next movie.  I like the different angles and direction the director has used
"Mar 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This was trash. Going in not knowing anything about the movie, I actually paused it to see if it was not the result of some kind of high school project. The acting was ordinary (possibly the result of a poor script) and the story was just lazy. It was so bad that it inspired me to leave my first ever review."
"Mar 7, 2024",POSITIVE,I don't pay much attention to what the critics have to say about any movie. I rate my movies based on if I was entertained. (and I was)
"Mar 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Overall this movie is bad but not funny bad. The first thing one notices right away are the very unnatural cheesy dialogues that seems to spawn out of the blue. Then the acting... Even the main character is really bad. Maybe they had a really tight budget because they spent everything on visuals, which is the only somewhat decent thing in the movie. The plot is also fact paced and confusing, with many unnecessary details that do not make any sense. They use a lot of speech to fill in the gaps but it is not enough and it comes off weird. If I have to read the book in order to understand the movie, it's not a good movie. I had to quit halfway because it wasn't fun. Conclusion: rotten, do not watch unless you want to waste your time, especially if you liked the book."
"Mar 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not Zacks best work at all, I dont want to spoil anything for those who havent seen it. But if you watched any Scifi of the last 50 yrs, you have seen this mess. Some good actors, but a lot of over acting too in strange scenes not edited well."
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE,This was a cool movie. Low score likely from excess of expectations 
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE,I honestly didn't see why everyone was bashing the movie the way they did. Was a decent action movie with a good special effects for a straight to tv movie. Yes some of the characters are cliche but you can't be too original now because everything has pretty much been done already. I'd say watch it for yourself before casting judgement and formulate your own opinion on whether or not it's a good movie.
"Mar 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Those were 136 minutes of my life I will never get back‚Ä¶such potential, perhaps the only thing were the special effects, EVERYTHING else was so purely done, from the script, to the acting, to the storyline üëéüèΩüëéüèΩüëéüèΩ"
"Mar 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"God this movie is awful.
The cgi and the action is good but the rest.
The characters are boring and forgettable and they are a copypaste of other characters.
The villain is the most generic bad dude you could see in a movie.
It's a ripoff of Dragonball,Star Wars and Harry Potter.
I still ask to myself how Snyderbozos like movies like this."
"Mar 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"It has beautiful scenery and effects, the antagonist really leaves an impression, the protagonist leaves us wondering a bit.
To be honest, it feels rushed at some points so it's not easy caring about some characters, but it's a cool action/sci-fi movie overall.
I went in with no expectations and was surprised, so give it a chance if you like the genre and do the same. If you're looking for something life changing and extremely mind blowing, this one might not be for you though."
"Feb 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,An absolute mess. A hodgepodge of the worst sci-fi elements all in one film.
"Feb 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,Worst waste of perfectly good effects since Ad Astra. Why not take one of the great SciFi plots (Radch) with a similar setting and make an awesome movie?
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This is unbearable garbage.  2/3 of the movie is slo motion and the other third is lens flares.

I am baffled on how you can rip off so many plot points from other franchises and yet end up with a nonsensical plot."
"Feb 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,Absolute trash in every way. Just horrible. I can't believe there's going to be a second part to this. I won't be wasting my money on it again.
"Feb 25, 2024",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it. Looking forward to the extended cut which tends to be Snyders bread and butter.
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Garbage. I feel sad for all the artists the time and effort to produce this visually just to have the dumbest story I have ever heard. 

This is my first review of anything ever. This is how upsetting I found this garbage"
"Feb 24, 2024",NEUTRAL,the movie had good visuals and good storyline
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"As the beginning of a story, Rebel Moon hits all the marks it aims to. It's a film that wears its influences on its sleeve and still manages to provide a few surprises along the way. In particular, the film's handling of major themes like colonialism and empire are top-notch, providing a grounding realism to what could have been simply a flashy space adventure."
"Feb 24, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The first hour felt interesting enough.  The second hour felt generic, and ultimately not very satisfying/compelling."
"Feb 24, 2024",NEUTRAL,"it tries to create this big world, but gets rushed and ends up to be flat.
In summary, it's a chain of quick quests to get new companions so you can fight the final boss."
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"There's a lot of potential in Rebel Moon's universe, but the haphazardly handled mess of a story proves to be a dumb ride from planet to planet in search for a team to fight a battle that never takes place in this movie anyway"
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,I was thoroughly entertained. Good vs evil. I watched it for entertainment only not to pick it apart.
"Feb 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Slomo. More slomo. Slomo agian. It was literally only slomos. Fight scenes were really bad. Animals well animated. Robots having to much of human movement. No one asked for backstory, got it anyway. Exact the same scenes from H-P, Star Wars etc. Good plot."
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,The more I watch the better it gets
"Feb 23, 2024",POSITIVE,Enjoyable film. Loved the action and visuals. Looking forward to Part 2
"Feb 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning but the story plot does need some work‚Ä¶ all in all, I actually quite enjoy this movie. Honestly don't get why it get so much hate. Starting to think it got reviewed bombed pay for by Disney to keep their Starwars franchise on top."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Despite the vitriol it received, I oddly found some enjoyment in this film. Its concept may not be original but the CGI effects managed to shine, hinting at a potential for redemption in the upcoming sequel."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Nothing is special about this film. And a handful of moments, like an acting performance, are terrible. This was part one of a two-part story. We'll see if I see the second part. What I know is that I don't have any investment in the characters."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"So happy I got to see this in 70MM. After a slow start, once the movie kicks into high gear it never lets up. Sofia is a star and a great lead. The other characters could've been more fleshed out but still do enough to be memorable. Can't wait to see the sequel and the extended Rated R cuts."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Great visual effects. Pretty trash acting but i think its more due to poor lines/writing, and attempts to make scenes grandiose and significant (and sooo much slow motion). All in all its pretty cringe to get through."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"OMG, I can't stand watching scenes in slow motion anymore, other than that The movie is only beautiful, thats it."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Didn't blow me away, was good to watch, worth it's time"
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Uggh - this is not an homage to Star Wars but rather a dull mockery of it. So many stolen ideas but, even worse, so very very boring. None of the characters are developed and one feels no investment in any character. Honestly, I was rooting for the bad guys to use their ""death star"" spaceship to blow up everything so that the movie would end. Alas, no such luck."
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This had a lot of potential, but the best character in the film is the villain. If the film had a longer run time it could've had the opportunity to flesh out the characters further. As you get no time to develop Any care for them"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This film was lame, flaccid, boring and had really bad acting. I had to stop watching after 45min. Don't watch unless you're so bored that this couldn't possibly bore you any further!"
"Feb 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,This is literally the worst movie I've watched the last 10 years. Please don't make a sequel.
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Movie visually WOW scenery colors tones depth use of slow motion action scenes look pretty good better with some then others story was basic but that is ok most movies take from others n combined and rename etc I would easily recommend this movie which I hope turns into a universe of it's own n competes well with rated R n pg13 titles I'd love for Zack to get a world to display his talents because they r so amazing n this movie shows it. Omg if u thought light sabers were cool this movie does it WAY BETTER so stop reading and check it out emerge urself into the world of rebel moon u wont want to leave I promise
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"I liked it. The visual effects are amazing and acting is very good. Although the storyline seems to be borrowed in parts from different movies (such as Star Wars), it is grand, epic, has a twist and certainly is entertaining. The good wins over the evil at the end, and thankfully no animals were killed in the process. Good movie and look forward to part 2."
"Feb 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"Really solid movie. I know that due to hype and other factors some had really high expectations, but this movie exceeded my expectations. 10 out of 10 will watch it again right before part 2 comes out."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Poor dialog, poor character development and even poor action scenes"
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Fantastic fights.  Female protagonist.  What's not to like.  Simplest dialog I will admit but the fantastic visuals are holding all of your attention anyway.  I hope everyone who loves a rebel joins me in watching this exciting movie. I can't wait for episode 2.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,Entertaining. It's like if Star Wars and Dune had a baby.
"Feb 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film, as a fan of Star Wars it's a big reason why I enjoy it, I understand for some it feels like a blatant ripoff in a lot of aspects but I think it still does a good job at being it's own thing, and having it's own unique creatures etc‚Äî the constant slow-mo shots were very repetitive and annoying and would constantly take me out of what was happening but it's still a fun movie. Not the greatest thing ever but also not as bad as people make it out to be. Really like the main character and I'm excited to watch part 2"
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,I liked the plot. Characters were badass. effects were decent. Dark tones and atmosphere. I liked the different alien and costumes. Bad guys were your typical space nazis and the main antagonist has a face that screams punchable.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Too bad, this film could've really been something interesting."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEUTRAL,Too bad it's so cliche and predictable. Set pieces can be fun at times.
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie, was a potential Star Wars script, abandoned, adopted and adapted. It's a DEI mess of a movie with zero character development, plot line or focus. Most of the ‚Äòmain characters' don't even have lines for roughly thirty minutes of the movie. The only thing missing from this absolute disaster of a movie is a heist montage, to the tune of a Rick and Morty satire."
"Feb 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Put in a blender ‚Äî Star Wars, Blade Runner, The Man in the High Castle, Frankenstein, and all the other basic clich√©s of movies, and voil√†: Rebel Moon. üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Feb 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Why even on a Part 2? The sound was great. Other than that a cheesy film with bad acting and directing.
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,You can call this movie war because it too is good for absolutely nothing
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,if you like slow motion shots then this will be for you..... as every other shot is a slow motion sequence. there were even slower motion moments within slow motion shots.  appears if there is a directors cut that kept all the charachter development to itself. charachters killed off with the music in the background trying to bring some emotion it seems but we dont know why as a viewer that we should care as dont know anything about them other than they turned up 10 minutes ago with a big build up to it.  i am a big fan of the genre but think i will give the sequel a miss
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Devoid of creativity, humor, originality, and entertainment value; as soulles as if it were generated by an AI chatbot."
"Feb 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Great cast, some great actors in the film. I think instead of TWO PART it definitely should've been compressed into one movie, with a load of the unnecessary scenes cut out. They attempted to make some ""epic"" character introductions, which felt pretty cringe‚Ä¶

Parts of the movie had literally no impact on the overall story apart from being filler. why the heck are some characters speaking in an Irish accent? The plot twists were mediocre and overall progression of the film was disappointing.

It's not something you should go out of your way to watch. However, I will give part 2 a watch as hopefully it's a slightly better than part one."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Extremely slow paced with way too much slo-mo shots and terrible dialogue. Feels like Star Wars meets Gladiator but nothing but the boring parts. This movie is a skip for sure.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Good story Line, great acting, Will  definetely watch next one ."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Frankenstein's monster of all of Sci-Fi movies from last 3 decades.
"Feb 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed watching this movie more than the Star Wars movies, I hope this movie will be even better in the second part"
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,When you are counting the minutes to get to the ending . The best part of this movie was the credits.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was like watching a bad remake of The Magnificent Seven only with 4 or 5 of them and quite cartoony as well. I expected a Science Fiction movie and I saw a Western.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It's a terrible version of Star Wars, with a shallow plot, characters without any charisma, excessive clich√©s, no originality, poorly done visual effects.  A waste of time."
"Feb 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,No ideas...totally ugly.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This sci-fi action movie was pretty good. Sofia Boutella, Michiel Huisman, Charlie Hunnam, Ed Skrein, and the rest of the cast did a pretty good job in this movie. The plot of the movie was action-packed, dramatic, and thrilling. It's about fighting against an enemy that wants to destroy everything. If you haven't seen this movie yet, check it out sometime. It's not great, but it's still worth it."
"Feb 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,Well its better than the last two Star Wars film......and the only reason why this film is better than those is because this film is its own universe and they are not breaking established lore. This film would be better as a tv series since they can develop the characters and their stories a lot more than a movie can.
"Feb 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,Really good visual effects but the story was hot garbage and left me feeling disappointed tbh
"Feb 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Dumb, derivative, un-original and all too serious about it."
"Feb 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I was excited for this but it was really really bad. Aside from a one good action sequence, the acting, story and cgi was kind of pathetic. "
"Feb 12, 2024",POSITIVE,It was actually really good. The story made sense and the graphics were a chefs kiss. I like the idea of space bounty hunters and a medieval space war type thing. I highly recommend seeing it !!
"Feb 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Terribly boring, I couldn't even finish 60 minutes of this movie, and I'll watch anything ... don't waste your time ... watch the local news instead."
"Feb 11, 2024",NEUTRAL,Has awful pacing but has amazing visual effects and great characters.
"Feb 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Completely lacking in originality and personality, but entertaining enough sci-fi action and drama with a dark and serious setting.  The interplanetary settings and CGI mostly look good as did the frequent action scenes, even if the amount of slow-motion was bordering on excessive.  The plot is your typical child of destiny starting a rebellion to take down the space Nazis by recruiting a multicultural team, but the acting felt awkward rather than dramatic and the lower age rating made it feel a bit tame.  Hopefully the next film will add some depth to the characters and explore the interesting seeds such as the robot's humanity."
"Feb 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"This was such a fun, riveting watch! Not sure why the rating was so low but I enjoyed it!"
"Feb 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This is a movie depiction of the word ""bloviate.""

Look it up.  It's a real word."
"Feb 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It's nice that I'm all the sci-fi to offs and the jarringly dull slow motion action sequences. They still found time to rip off Harry Potter and tame a Griffin. With a different director and editor, this could have been entertaining."
"Feb 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Bang! Bang! Boooom! P'tow! P'tow! P'tow! Boooom! [And in slow motion]: Booooooooooooooom! ""Noooooooooooo!"" Bang! Boooom!

And that's the best dialogue in the film."
"Feb 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I like the robot, too much slow motion, stop idolizing allllllll of the characters."
"Feb 7, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This movie lacks in early character development but doesn't disappoint with a healthy supply of action and plot events.  I think it is easy to dock the movie for the early lack of plot, but it also must be remembered that this is part 1 and if part 2 delivers the same amount of action and build upon the lackluster story, It might blossom into what most of us would consider a terrific sci fi film."
"Feb 7, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Gritty. Stunning. Builds a universe on the genius of Star wars, dune, bladerunner et al.  I cannot disagree with the critics on the concepts 'stolen' but does this movie not combine the best of elements of the above.  Epic landscapes, worlds dedicated to mining, human nature at is worst... greed and power, and best....  Where it is unique is in not introducing Jedi force magic like Star wars, therein lies the fantasy of childhood dreams. 
However, we do have several 'magnificent samurai' , who although they do not use magic are so incredibly talented that we are being led to believe that they alone can take a stand against a hugely powerful controlling empire like governance.  The magnificent seven, the samurai too were outnumbered but not outgunned.  In this first movie the inspirational characters needed more development, they needed to perhaps survive an attack and realize that they needed to split up and rally their own factions over time.  The village is merely symbolic here, it's about the struggle against a cruel oppressive rule, a fight for peace through autonomy, a drive for fairness and respect, in that respect it is, or should not be, the seven samurai. Sadly the closing scenes are the seven back on the original planet, perhaps the second movie will see people and weapons flocking to the planet but somehow I doubt it, sadly those super hero types will be held responsible for the defense rather than use their influence to gather support, inspire resistance against the oppressor, lead a truly sizeable force , but then will we criticize for copying star wars again. Easily done but unfair. Every historical battle has had its unequal sides but always had the weaker been able to take stands against the stronger.  Should the resistance in this movie franchise start a guerilla war , inflicting stings and retreating into the shadows or will we then criticize it for representing the futility of our own struggles against oppressive governments and controlling mega corporations.  Ultimately it may come over as a twee, feel good movie based on the fantasy that a small number of skilled individuals can single handedly deliver us from tirany.  'I wish'... Is the downfall of any review. Let's look at what we have, consider the concepts, the screenplay, the cinematography, the predictable script, the heroes, the obvious weak points in the oppressive regime and realize that those of us who hoped for an adult sci-fi have sadly been let down. At least there wasn't a gun toting raccoon and small taking tree in this one.
Do we think the producers and directors had to fall foul of the modern movie scourge of 'general box office appeal'.  Capitalism scores another nail in the coffin of individualism and uniqueness."
"Feb 5, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Rebel Moon Part 1: a Child of Fire - 5.7 - So from the get to I had mixed feelings about this movie. It was okay, it was not as bad as some or the internet portrayed it to be, but it was by no means great. It felt like a rushed edgier version of star wars. The fight sceens were great, that was the bread and butter, but the actual character development and plot seemed extremely rushed. For starters so the main plot the army needed to take over this planet to feed its entire army, and then a gang of like 6 people were going to take on this army. Seemed very far fetched, the twist was unexpected, but it was also a character that I most liked so far, so that caught me off guard. Overall it was worth the watch for the fight scenes and pure action alone, but this movie is no second coming of star wars or any space saga.
Hopefully the second part will be alittle better, and I will be there to check it out. The robot ended up being my favorite character for what it is worth. Official sundaynightstreaming rating of 5.7"
"Feb 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"I realy enjoyed this film. Best film I have seen this year (2024)
Lots of action, good acting and special effects. I also liked the story.
Part 1 and I cannot wait for part 2. 
I am going to watch it again and update my review further."
"Feb 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"Five adults watched it, five adults enjoyed it. Of course it is founded on Kirosawa's  Seven Samurai and is not the first to do it, but does that make it any less fun?
Not for us!"
"Feb 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The visuals are interesting at times especially the alien creatures and some of the ship and the sound effects are very good. For me I can't think of a single other positive, this is simply an extremely poor movie, possibly the worst I have seen in over a decade. The dialog is just atrocious, the acting at best wooden, and the plot somehow manages to be super predictable and at the same time absolute nonsense. Action scenes were so poorly done that they were immersion breaking I struggled to watch.

I think the only reason to watch this is for the curiosity of wanting to watch a high budget car crash of a movie."
"Feb 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It's as if someone with no knowledge of the genre looked at what they thought worked in every other Sci-Fi movie and threw it together in a willy nilly way.

It's as if Donald trump made a movie..."
"Feb 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"I don't see how it's low rated. I thought it was a series and I wanted episode 2 but it was too long to be one episode. Can't wait for part 2. If the only knock is it borrows story parts from other movies then that tells you all you need to know. It's a great movie and they just found something to give it a negative review. Watch it, I really liked it. Anything in space has to be compared to Star Wars so if it's not a Star Wars story it's a problem! Ridiculous banter I tell you!"
"Feb 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,Ambitiousness and world-building are the key elements of the film but lacks in character depth and originality.
"Feb 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I should like this movie. It is Sci fi, action, great effects, but for some reason I didn't. When I thought about why, I realised it is because I had no affinity with any of the characters. I didn't really care if they lived or died. The only one I warmed to was the faceless robot. There is no soul in this movie."
"Feb 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Really pretty scenes with a ""less than"" story. I actually love all the cast, but the script, story, and pacing were lacking."
"Feb 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"This story has obvious parallels to the Seen Samurai. The first part is about their selection, ending with their return to the village and the resurrection of the evil outlaw. Part two will undoubtedly continue the saga of the defense of the village/moon. Not sure what all the fuss is about....it's like complaining The Magnificent Seven wasn't as good as the original Samurai film. Just make some popcorn and chill."
"Feb 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"If you love sci-fi and love fantasy Rebel Moon will not disappoint. 

Zack is building such an epic universe and this film feels like it's only scratching the surface. 

Sofia Boutella is an incredible leading lady and Ed Skrein as Admiral Noble is terrifying. 

If you can't wait for the R-Rated cut I highly recommend picking up the novelization. The PG-13 version doesn't do the story justice."
"Feb 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Beyond bad. Incoherent, derivative, sloppy, boring. The narrative was nonsensical, the action was boring, the ""stylish"" cinematics were interesting‚Ä¶in 300. Now, they are just tired, massively overdone and forced.  The movie was overly long while still managing to feel like another two hours were needed to actually clue the audience into the motivations of the many characters, none of whom were anything but one dimensional caricatures of bad tropes to begin with.  I truly wish I could get the time back in my life that was wasted on this utter garage of a movie.  I knew exactly what was going to happen at the end, even while there being nothing whatsoever that could have clued the audience in. Why? Because it was the stupidest possible thing to happen and that tracked with how bad the movie was.  The only halfway decent thing about the movie were the special effects. Too bad they were so horribly wasted on this trash movie.  Now, pardon me while I leap is slow motion through the air in exactly the same way nearly every character does to come crashing down with whatever random weapon assigned to me onto something that will have zero actual consequence. Again. Oh, just for giggles, again. Once more, because it's apparently my signature and my fans won't know that it's my review without it being done again. And again. Seriously, this movie sucked."
"Feb 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"OMG, the slow-mo shots in every action sequence!!! The story was simple, world-building mediocre. A ""fine"" movie. Wish it was set in a richer universe. Star Wars?"
"Feb 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"A visually stunning and engaging movie. Like any first entry, the focus is on world and lore building so the story does come across a bit linear and straight forward. But there is definitely depth and lots more to know before it can be termed simply as a Star Wars rip off. Maybe this was what the new trilogy should have been .."
"Jan 31, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Film with a fantastic heroine, a phenomenal killing machine. The depicted world is somewhat absurd. Plowing the land using a horse and plow, accompanied by spaceships. Simplicity, mental shortcuts, and stereotypes."
"Jan 31, 2024",POSITIVE,"I think people need to not be so over critical about this movie. Yes, it not very original, but what is these days? The cast is impressive and delivered in the acting department. The story was predictable but the majority of stories are these days. I say it's not about if it is original but how well the already done ideas were executed. I personally thought this movie was executed very well. Hell I liked this better than the first part of Dune and I love dune. Sci-fi movies are mostly garbage right now so, this was a breath of fresh air for me. I just think everyone should give this one a chance or even a second chance if they didn't like it the first time."
"Jan 30, 2024",NEUTRAL,not a great movie on many levels. i still watch part 2 though. maybe somehow this gets better. part of the world is intriguing
"Jan 30, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The action sequences are ruined by the constant use of slowmotion, the story does not make sense and the characters are bland."
"Jan 30, 2024",POSITIVE,"The action and visuals are great. Some of the choreography appeared slow at times though.  The villains are vicious, story can be predictable, but so was Dune, still a good watch."
"Jan 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The movie ruined my Saturday evening. But I couldn't turn it off because I kept hoping it would get better.

I knew about the bad reviews and the story, which is quite close to ""Star Wars"". I usually don't mind that at all and I thought that the bad review could have come from a lot of ""Star Wars fanboys"" who just wanted to hate around.

Unfortunately, the movie is really bad! It's like someone watched Star Wars drunken while reading a fantasy novel and the next morning made a movie out of what he could remember. 

In one of the comments I read something about ""dazzling lights"" or ""dazzling scenes"". That's not an exaggeration and it is not meant in a figurative sense. Really disturbing."
"Jan 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"Highly recommended, not sure what is wrong with the critics as they seem to have forgotten what pure escapism is!"
"Jan 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Fun visuals, terrible terrible terrible writing"
"Jan 28, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I'm glad that I didn't listen to the reviews. I really enjoyed it, maybe no Emmys in its future but worth the watchüëçüèæ"
"Jan 27, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I'd describe it as a Star Wars wannabe movie.  Pretty much the same plot line.  But they didn't quite pull it off.  Visually, it was excellent. But character wise and plot wise it just didn't resonate all the way.  Really bewildering character decisions that keep the plot going or turn it on a dime. Like putting a weapon in the hands of your enemy telling them to do one thing then being surprised when they use it on you kind of thing. Also, the actors and actresses were a little to ""glam"" looking for the character experiences they were representing. That didn't quite work for me."
"Jan 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Just another low-quality girl boss movie with exceptionally mediocre acting. And I have so many questions. Why does Charlie Hunnam just stand in the background not talking for almost the entire movie? Why keep introducing main characters halfway through the film? How is it that the ""farmers"" have no weapons? Wouldn't they all be dead long ago? Too many plot holes."
"Jan 26, 2024",NEGATIVE,"cringing in slow motion.
This is a difficult movie to watch to the end. The beginning, the first 5 minutes, is so absurdly bad that it feels like the film is a sarcastic parody of Star Wars, but the narrative tone suggests otherwise. It seems like a script that wants to be taken seriously but lacks a compelling story, is verbose, constantly over-explains itself, with many loose ends in the plot, caricatured characters lacking charisma and clich√©s. The cinematography is poor, the choice of lenses is subpar, with characters participating in a scene appearing out of focus or blurred. Always, always slow motion. Cheesy soundtrack. This is bad in everyway."
"Jan 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Not bad, not really great though. Flingers crossed the director cut will make this movie really shine, cause I wouldn't say any scenes were bad enough to take out, they just didn't really add up to a whole lot. The actions cool, characters were given a good start in this film, it just felt like right now, we don't have enough, at least not yet."
"Jan 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,The movie was so bad that I registered on this site just to write a review. The story is plain stupid. Just doesn't make sense. Casting is bad. Characters are flat. Acting is really bad.  I only watched it till the end because it was the only thing I downloaded for a flight. Don't make the same mistake. It's a waste of over 2hrs...
"Jan 23, 2024",NEUTRAL,"More Seventh Samurai than Star Wars and I dug it a lot, loved all the scenes with Jimmy and Kora.

Most of the issues I have with the pacing will hopefully be fixed in the directors cut, nice introduction to this world that sets the stage for Part 2."
"Jan 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Bad poorly writen movie.

In just 6 minutes the movie alread remakes the Morpheus speech in Matrix Reloaded in a poorly way. That is  just the genining of a convoluted movie with nonsensical plot points, bad dialogue e boring action scenes. The pay offs are so close to the set ups that never gives you a sense of satisfation. Not recommend. I would give 2/5 if it was a normal movie, but for a pretentions one it only deserves 1/5."
"Jan 23, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Visually spectacular. Otherwise, it's just every trope from Star Wars, Dune, and 300 put in a blender with no character development, surprises, or story arc to speak of. Amazing to me that it got made with such a poor script."
"Jan 22, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Was expecting a bad movie. Really liked Zacks justice league, bat v sup, 300 etc. I don't hate the guy , I get his vibe .. but this movie... Started so slow , than it was wrapped up in 10 min and it didn't end.. a part 2 and 3 look to me like a really really long boring movie.. and still felt like quality somehow. Skinny girl beating up grown man wasn't to much. Some things didn't come across, it had so character development in a way. But not really. It felt like explained character for a new franchises universe boring waste of time.. and jet , I didn't hate it. It was only just before the battle sequence I started looking at my phone .. thinking of some random thing.. the movie lost me. Would I watch the movie knowing what I know now ? Probably not. Do I feel like 3 hours of my life got stolen.. no. Would I watch part 2 ? Probably not, unless I'm bored."
"Jan 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"I took forever to watch the movie due to the bomb-reviewing of internet, but in my opinion, the only fair complaint is the bunch of unnecessary slow motion. Other than that, the movie is pretty good!"
"Jan 22, 2024",POSITIVE,Expecting the worst but found it quit good.
"Jan 22, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's okay. I like the idea, but I think it's too much Star Wars. It's like Irish farmer's that meets nazi people, that beat the others with a stick. I don't have a good view on the characters and they have a bad dialogue."
"Jan 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"Fantastic from visuals, to characters/actors and storyline.  Can't wait for part 2."
"Jan 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Slow motion, vfx,cgi,fight scenes are good.  Story, script & screenplay are very weak."
"Jan 21, 2024",POSITIVE,It's a good movie. The beginning is slightly cheesy but it the quality improves drastically as the movie progresses. I don't really understand the harsh reviews. It's entertaining and keeps you watching.
"Jan 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Action packed and a good visual flair, great! But the story is terrible, too many characters we don't know anything about or care about. The movie has to provide exposition or statement about the character because even if they have been with the group for half the movie we don't know who they are or care about them."
"Jan 21, 2024",POSITIVE,Art should be appreciated for the effort it takes. Clearly great effort and good story.
"Jan 21, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was visually appealing, interesting storyline, I like Zack Snyder's directing. Dialogue isn't Tarantino but it doesn't have to be. Story is a little fuzzy in transition but overall every entertaining, can't wait for the next episode."
"Jan 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"A unique start for an imaginative new universe. Clearly in need of the extended cut, but a really good movie in its own right."
"Jan 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"nothing original, predictable with bad acting and poorly designed characters."
"Jan 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Wanted to like it, but in throughout the entire runtime, nothing really happens. The movie introduces several different characters but doesn't give any one of them enough screen time or backstory to make you actually connect with them in anyway. Just a completely forgettable movie."
"Jan 19, 2024",POSITIVE,Rebel moon is basically if Star Wars was good. Seems very similar but missing the wildly cringey and horrible special effects of Star Wars. Excited for the next one!
"Jan 19, 2024",POSITIVE,"really enjoyed the movie!!! set up a foundation for characters, great world building and amazing visuals!! looking forward to part 2"
"Jan 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I was excited to see this one, with all the hype around it, but it really didn't live up to expectations. It was entertaining and I'll probably watch part 2 but I'm not chomping at the bit waiting for it."
"Jan 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,It feels broken and has so many plot holes I just gave up. I'm blaming the writers for this bad score. The actors did the best they could.
"Jan 19, 2024",NEGATIVE,Flashy visuals and character design can't save this Warhammer 40k/Star Wars mashup
"Jan 18, 2024",POSITIVE,"The cinematography, the everything. It was like a Greek tragedy but with the scale of science fiction."
"Jan 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Boring, not a clear storyline"
"Jan 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,I've seen a lot of reviews talking about how much of this movie is borrowed from better ones but I think the writing and story direction are still its biggest issues. The characters barely talk to each other and it is often actively painful to listen to what they do say. It's so boring and disjointed I actually missed them recruiting that general. Not that it mattered because he barely does anything
"Jan 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie is so bad I actually got a Rotten Tomatoes account so I could tell everyone how bad this is.

Some people say, quite generously I think, this is a space opera in the vein of the ""Seven Samurai"".

That is an insult to at least Six of the Seven Samurai.

This is more like a over CG'd version of ""Battle Beyond the Stars"" which, in itself was a poor copy of the Seven Samurai but at least the characters were well developed.

Rotten Tomates is making me rate this movie by the use of Stars.

I gave it a half a star but, if it were up to me I would give it half of a protostar.

To be honest, much like a plate of Brussel Sprouts, I couldn't finish watching the movie but I had eaten enough to know it had a terrible taste and needed a couple glasses of something to force it down my gullet.

They could have reformed Alex in the movie ""A Clockwork Orange"" by making him watch this instead of ultraviolence.

Could have cured him in half the time IMHO...

When part II comes out, please find something less painful to do like have a fully-clawed cat high on catnip check your head for lice, I dunno"
"Jan 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,I had high hopes for this but it felt like it left a lot on the table as to what it could have been.
"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Es una pel√≠cula que comienza d√°ndonos una visi√≥n de un pueblo unificado que es intervenido por un comando espacial para apoderarse de lo que producen, luego se ven forzados a pedir ayuda a varios personajes renegados enemigos de un imperio que solo aplasta al que se le oponga.
Pel√≠cula muy entretenida, con influencias de Star Wars en algunos aspectos pero, tambi√©n tiene ese toque personal de ZS que sella su estilo con el desenfoque estilo pel√≠culas western y su estilo m√°s caracter√≠stico de Slow Motion en escenas claves.
El ritmo de la pel√≠cula es consistente y cuando te das cuenta llegaste a la batalla final.
Recomiendo que la vean sin dejarse influenciar por Haters.
:)"
"Jan 17, 2024",NEGATIVE,Plot and story lines disconnected and confusing.
"Jan 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Plenty of action and great acting.
I can't wait for part 2. People that never like sci-fi should stop reviewing things they inherently dislike."
"Jan 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,Horrid. I can't believe this was made.
"Jan 16, 2024",POSITIVE,its so so good space fans will love it

"Jan 16, 2024",NEGATIVE,"You must have to have read the book first. Even with the ""Part 1"" warning, this movie really goes nowhere, and takes it sweet time doing it.  The second half will have you asking ""is this the same movie I've been watching?""  I may not be. Who can tell?"
"Jan 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I wish I didn't have to give this half a star. This was so bad. Just because you have the budget to put in everything, doesn't mean you should. I felt like I was watching 20 different movies in the span of two hours. No world building, no character development,  and an unnecessary amount  of slow motion."
"Jan 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Don't waste your time. It is literally a copy of everything and nothing, the characters have no strength, charisma or character. The special effects are good but you can't base a movie on CGI. It is also absolutely predictable from start to finish."
"Jan 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Couldn't even get past the 30 minute mark. Terrible movie.
"Jan 15, 2024",POSITIVE,"Honestly, based on the reviews, I initially anticipated this film to be nearly unwatchable. However, when my wife and I decided to give it a chance, we were pleasantly surprised.

While the film introduces viewers to a rich and expansive new universe with intricate characters and deep motivations, it is not without its flaws. The main issue lies in its duration, as it undeniably needed an extra hour or more.

The pacing feels rushed, and if the intention was to encourage viewers to watch the extended cut, it would leave me feeling somewhat deceived.

I find myself wishing this were a series rather than a film, allowing each character the opportunity to shine. With a longer runtime from the start, this could potentially evolve into a new cult classic, and the decision not to provide it with ample time was a significant oversight."
"Jan 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,Did I just watch a slow motion star wars film?
"Jan 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Es buena pelicula para pasar el tiempo, parece que esta un poco recortada y con sinceridad las pel√≠culas tipo star wars no me gustan, aun as√≠ esta me agrado para pasar el tiempo con los cuates unas gaseosas y palomitas de ma√≠z."
"Jan 15, 2024",NEGATIVE,"There is something like tooooo much slowmo and rule of cool.
More story and not so obius NSC characters would help.
And what the hell was with the teeth?

Only good thing are the visuals.

The saddest thing is that I was kinda looking forward for this franchise."
"Jan 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Meh...was not a fan of all the slow motion fight scenes, just gets annoying. If I happen to miss part two not the end of the world"
"Jan 15, 2024",POSITIVE,It was refreshing to see something new.
"Jan 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,Fun movie it has some pacing issues but it's not terrible.
"Jan 15, 2024",POSITIVE,I loved it but I love sci fi and fantasy.
"Jan 15, 2024",POSITIVE,Storyline was great. Super fantasy. Graphics amazing. Action keeps you on your feet. Character development is in tact. Not sure why so many low ratings? Am I missing something? Can't wait for part 2.
"Jan 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,Very slow and not well written. The dialogue is weak and the entire movie relies on visuals and well worn sci-fi character tropes. Very disappointed it wasnt more original.
"Jan 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A clich√© built from various other works that didn't have as striking an impact as their counterparts, coupled with lapses in the remembrance of characters in the storyline and somewhat weak cinematography‚Äîconfusing action scenes and unnecessary framings."
"Jan 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It wasn't the best movie, but not the worst either. Very predictable girl- boss sci-fi flick. Some nice visuals but terribly simplistic dialog."
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great movie to watch with the kids, beautiful scenery. Thanks for making this"
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,I liked it for the Wh40k vibe
"Jan 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Love the Sci-Fi and the special effects, but the story line is so so...; however, I'll wait for part II."
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Loved it.  Great world building.  Can't wait to see where they take it.
"Jan 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,It's not the most amazing or original movie but it's entertaining and the visuals are great.
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Epic space fantasy. Incredible representation of other worlds. A wonderful escape from - well my daily life! 

I don‚Äôt agree with the movie critics who appear too hung up with derivative references to other movies and consequently and (imho) inappropriately rating movies down. I have worked for many years with professional music recordings and quite frankly everything is derivative - and it is of little relevance. This movie was an epic emotional and experiential escape - and yes it is a movie - and not a TV series like Star Wars' Andor, where the time for solid character development is readily available. Nevertheless it was easy to connect and empathise with the salient protagonists against the Nazi-like galactic regime, and enjoy the journey and vision delivered in Rebel Moon."
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Its a good action movie, typical for this genre characters,nice plot, great visuals, truly I don't understand why so many people dislike it, i can't wait for the next chapter"
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,"Ticks all of the boxes, nothing new but lots of shazam and everything I needed in a great sci-fi movie. I loved it!"
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,I did not expect this movie to be this good! Me and my wife loved it and I can not wait for part 2.
"Jan 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Shame.
The first part is ok, nice setting and visuals, a bit slow. The movie starts derailing pretty hard at the Star Wars like saloon scene. After that, it's a crazy rush sequence of characters and ""story"" threads with no rationale whatsoever‚Ä¶All random."
"Jan 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Could have, should have been MUCH better! Visually beautiful like everything he does but the story‚Ä¶ which had potential, was extremely rushed. Part One should have ended with the search for the team‚Ä¶ instead we get the team, no character development or attachment, then battle, some die, don't care."
"Jan 13, 2024",POSITIVE,Lage verwachtingen en een na hoop zure recensies te hebben gelezen...heb ik me prima visueel geamuseerd...veel star wars films zijn stukken saaier
"Jan 13, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Not a bad movie if you don't expect much. It feels like a combination of Sci Fi and fantasy movies from the past, but it was entertaining and beautiful to watch."
"Jan 13, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I knew nothing about this going in. Unlike other reviewers who thought the movie opened slowly, I thought the first half-hour was terrific, leading up to a satisfying action scene that set the story up beautifully. Then it turned into Seven Samurai/The Magnificent Seven but in space, and I was fine with that. But the script had to give each ""warrior"" a *developed* backstory that made their joining the crusade plausible in the first place; not just a great fight scene."
"Jan 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,"After I watched Star Wars as a kid I was drawing Vader, his Tie Fighter, lightsabers, X-wings and Star Destroyers, Death Star of course and tons of other designs.
I want to ask modern kids - do they remember anything from this film worthy to draw?"
"Jan 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,"What a sad movie. My husband and I were really looking forward to it but we turned it off half way through because we got bored. We turned it on again the next day (I think? Sad that I can't remember for sure) but it was all just too violent for us. The effects were amazing, of course, but far behind what we were hoping to see overall."
"Jan 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,Planet of hot farm workers lol‚Ä¶
"Jan 13, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I've never rated a movie on this site before, and I probably never will again. I disliked this movie so much that I created this account just to tell anyone who reads this to stay as far away from this movie as you can. Please, for the love of god, save your 2 hours and 14 minutes. Go do anything else with the limited amount of time you have left on this earth."
"Jan 13, 2024",POSITIVE,I love the world that was created and can't wait to see where it leads.
"Jan 13, 2024",NEUTRAL,It isn't bad but not great. It is basically a remake of Battle Beyond the Stars.
"Jan 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Over-reliance on CGI and action sequences, a plot that doesn't make any sense, and poor character development, this movie is absolutely not the next Star Wars."
"Jan 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,THE story seemed rushed and acting was horriffic
"Jan 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Where to start. CGI was acceptable. For such production I would expect much more. Blurriness was always there. The movie could have been 1hour less with proper slow mo. It has the slow motion of all the matrix, 300 and all the max payne games combined. Acting mediocre .The protagonist was one of the worse so that doesn't help. The rest of the cast didn't do any favors too. Scenario, meh. I think these are more than enough to not have to go even further."
"Jan 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The story was bad, the accents annoying and the camera work could have been a lot better."
"Jan 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"Definitivamente me encant√≥
La personalidad de cada personaje
La coherencia de su actitud pero a la vez lo enigm√°tico de su comportamiento tan impredecible y la calidad y √°ngulo  de cada toma que el director  le puso me levanta la ansiedad  de esperar la segunda parte.
Buen√≠simo üëèüèª üëèüèª üëèüèª"
"Jan 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Horrible movie, feels like it should have been a tv show.. tries to hard to be something special and was very boring.."
"Jan 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Visually stunning but mainly terrible, very poor character development clash with a story that has been told a hundred times before."
"Jan 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I really wanted to like this film‚Ä¶ I love ZS's other films for the most part. This turned out to be such a poorly conceived story and production that I am writing this review at the 2 hr mark because I just can't take it anymore. This is painful to watch. Casting was good but the acting direction is all over the place. Sets had visual flair but there's just so much nonsense going on that it's distracting. Whatever made ZS's other films so good is clearly missing from this production. Watchmen and 300 were incredible films. ZS's DC films were good. Sucker Punch missed the mark and on that same level, this film did the same. Characters are contrived. This is poorly written. I can't believe how much I dislike a film I REALLY wanted to love‚Ä¶."
"Jan 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,"felt rushed and disjointed. No depth to any of the characters, or the places visited. Visually stunning and great idea behind the movie just poorly executed"
"Jan 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"Loved it! It's hard not to love an epic space/sci-fi movie with Sofia Boutella in the lead. Every movie can't start out with an enormous budget the size of a modern day Star Wars/Marvel/Avatar movie. The critics will look for imperfections in the details like always, but in the end there's only one thing about a movie that truly matters...""Are you not entertained??!"""
"Jan 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,Not good. Not good at all. It felt like a jumbled mess of little bits of other movies.
"Jan 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I finished this film more confused than I began. Perhaps it is my own ignorance but I couldn't identify a halfway decent motivation  behind a single characters' actions. We were bombarded with characters and information without the slightest attempt at explaining or expanding on any of it. 
The main character barley exchanged two words with half her team mates and they were convinced to join her ? Not to mention the shoddy patchwork of sci-fi clich√©s. It felt gimmicky at best and just embarrassing at worst. I hope part two will wrap up the MANY loose ends but oof."
"Jan 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"I don't get the trashing this movie has received. It's wonderful. Fantastic even. Feels like a space opera and harkens back to that classic serialized feel that's full of nostalgia. Add great effects, score, and solid acting, you've got a wonderful thing going here. Loved it."
"Jan 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This was so bad it was laughable- I wish I had the sense enough to turn it off earlier but I kept thinking it HAD to get better. We deserve better! I didn't care about a single character, the stupid villain trying to get the villagers' grain (lol), the manipulative slow-motion action, the terrible acting. Who thought it was a good idea to blatantly rip off so many great films from the past and smash them together in one big gloss-fest with no emotional connection? We are not 12 years old!!"
"Jan 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie definitely deserves 4 stars, it's different and some very good special effects and I enjoyed it."
"Jan 11, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Was disappointed.
This seemed to be a homage to/remake of the magnificent 7 / 7 samurai.
It is stilted and looked like a series if storyboards put together to address the 7 samurai plot.

Did not justify the hype.
Can only hope part 2 will have a more original plot and continuity."
"Jan 11, 2024",NEUTRAL,It was OK but introduced an overwhelming  amount of characters very quickly so you really don't get invested into this world. All action and little substance.  The action is great so kind of a fun watch.
"Jan 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"I don‚Äôt understand the hate, Was it Amazing? Eh lol but I know a bad movie and this isn‚Äôt is lol it felt like Star Wars which this was pitched by Synder to Lucas film before Disney bought them. I enjoyed the movie, it‚Äôs pretty much free give it a watch! I‚Äôm looking forward to part 2 ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Jan 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Bad acting from all. Maybe it's the script, but I felt nothing for anyone. Bad guy is not bad enough, and we all know a good villain makes a good movie."
"Jan 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Hodge podge of various Sci-Fi movies. Nothing original and no character development. Even down to the cantina Star Wars scene and Jax Solo. Entertaining enough to watch, but far from good."
"Jan 11, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie can't wait for part 2
"Jan 11, 2024",POSITIVE,Visually stunning and great acting.
"Jan 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,Poor story line. Horrible graphics. Below average production.
"Jan 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,Too sad to never watch something as bad as this
"Jan 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"No means to insult 12 year olds, but this feels like the definition of ""made by a 12 year old"". The script and dialog is just horrible. The cinematography overuses so many tropes including in the wrong places. It feels like a movie where somebody just got 166m to make whatever their want and that ""whatever"" wasn't very good..."
"Jan 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Otra pel√≠cula sobre una Mery Zue rebelde, intocable y toda poderosa contra una facci√≥n fascista y patriarcal, donde la mayor√≠a de los hombres aliados son unos idiotas cobardes que apenas hacen lo que pueden."
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"Not even close to a bad film, but the cut scenes are obvious. Great world building that is enhanced with pretty visuals and led by a strong performance by Sofia Boutella. Despite pacing issues and more development needed for the rest of the rebels, Rebel Moon is a great start for the part 1 of Zack‚Äôs new space fantasy tale."
"Jan 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,The visual effects are good. That is where it ends. You can tell the makers have trolls writing good reviews because there is nothing good about this movie. The actors are ok but the writing is so poor you never care about their stories. They are comic book characters with poor links between chapters. I felt like I was watching a video game where you advance to the next level once a key was found and there was no connection between the levels. The writing is so poor. I watch hundreds of movies and this is top 5 in my worst movies ever made. I am sure Part 2 will make it there also. Save 90 minutes of your life and avoid this disaster.
"Jan 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The movie could be like an hour shorter if you cut out all the unnecessary slo-mo that is way over used here. Character development felt rushed or completely non-existent. Story was literally just a worse version of Samurai 7, Watch that instead."
"Jan 10, 2024",POSITIVE,"Good movie, better than half the marvel poop comming out."
"Jan 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A 2 hour snooze fest that was so poorly written and hard to watch that I made an account for this review. It will leave you wanting to throw rocks at your TV for it to be over, but you feel obligated to continue because you already watched an hour of this nonsense. Talk about cliches, no character development, and scenes that look like a computer wallpaper. Dangerously un-enjoyable."
"Jan 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A poorly executed , indifferently acted version of the magnificent 7. Just awful. Echoes of Star Wars, mad max, and numerous other sci fi/fantasy movies. Almost as if it had been written by AI. Incredibly average special effects. I couldn't find anything to like."
"Jan 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Spoilers Ahead:

There was nothing original in this movie. I love 300 and am a huge Star Wars fan, so went in with an open mind. But this movie was Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven set in the Star War universe, with Gamora from Marvel as the main character (Kora's backstory is exactly Gamora's- girl on a planet that is slaughtered by a megalomaniac, she is spared, adopted, and raised by said megalomaniac, becomes a super soldier, and then decides to fight against her adoptive father.) They even had an actor from Gladiator portray a general who was betrayed, and ended up in a Gladiator fighting pit in a coliseum. 

I actually really wanted to like this movie, but it was so unoriginal, and had so little character development, that I just couldn't get into it. 

It only really got my attention with the last shot of the Anthony Hopkins robot wearing the antler crown. I doubt I'll watch part two, but I'll at least read the Wikipedia plot synopsis to see what that was all about."
"Jan 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Boring, pointless, shallow, and a waste of time."
"Jan 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"So so so so bad. It made me angry. Never rated anything here, first time now. Gave 0.5 star cause I can't give it any less."
"Jan 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,Zach Synder has reached the limit of his potential and should not be allowed to make any more movies. He is a one trick pony with slow motion and it now looks horrible. I love sci fi. But this is shallow. Zero character depth. Huge story holes. It's really one of the worst movies I have seen in some time.
"Jan 9, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's shallow and a bit unrealistic, but there are moments that dazzle, and those are worth seeing. It's an entertaining enough two hours."
"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"La pel√≠cula se siente como la historia de un videojuego, es simple, visualmente grandiosa, y entretenida. Me encanta el slow-motion que hace que las escenas se vean m√°s √©picas. Esperando la segunda parte."
"Jan 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I was really looking forward to seeing this. Don't get me wrong, the visuals were amazing but I really don't know what they were trying to do with the plot. It was just a mixture of different sci-fi films with way too much slow motion."
"Jan 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I find more plot cohesion and character development in my six year old recapping his half remembered dreams from the night before. I truly cannot believe how utterly empty this movie is, for all its bells and whistles."
"Jan 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Bad acting, ridiculous dialogues, unappealing characters, etc. The list goes on. Just clich√© af. One star only coz the visual is amazing."
"Jan 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Completely void of any content. Oh wait the droid was kinda interesting, too bad it wasn't in most of the movie."
"Jan 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,what was that? why did i expect so much from this director whose only good work was  300. not going to waste my time on him.
"Jan 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Horrible, horrible film"
"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"E' un bel Film. Ha si dei difetti che non inficiano una buona godibilit√†. 
Una bella ambientazione (anche se attinge da vari film).
A parte la protagonista gli altri personaggi (belli) non sono purtroppo molto caratterizzati 
Da rivedere insieme alla seconda parte."
"Jan 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Predicable, cliched, unoriginal garbage."
"Jan 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie has to be one of the worst movies of the decade!!!! I cannot believe people actually have this movie a good review. Horrible acting and the plot made zero sense. What a waste of two hours. I would rather watch paint dry. Wow!!!!
"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE,Best science fiction movie I have seen in a long time.
"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie was great and I'm sure the extended directors cut will only add on to improve this beautifully stunning sci fi space opera.
"Jan 9, 2024",NEGATIVE,The ridiculous ninja/samurai lady and the native American hawk whisperer had me in utter disbelief. The fact perdon/people got paid to write this nonsensical jargon is shocking. Please stop any more production immediately. Rewrite it and do it over. Only this time write it for people who can actually process a few small.complex ideas. Such as turn left or turn right or push the green button. ‚úÖ
"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie is so very underrated i think its quite good.. is it STAR WARS.. nope vut its still pretty good
"Jan 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"I went it with (almost) no expectations and I loved the movie. Forget what it was originally supposed to be and who made it, and just watch a great Sci-Fi revenge movie."
"Jan 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Just as bad as I thought, bad acting, unispired characters, awful villain, terrible story, if I tried to make a more generic sci-fi movie, I couldnt. Oh and the slow mo shots, wtf is that. Terrible movie deserves every single bad review it got"
"Jan 8, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed the cinematography, plot, most characters and the visual escape for a couple of hours. It's only part one so I expect that the whole will be better."
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,Loved this story just refreshing aand exciting to watch. Great characters visuals and story. Yes starwars esc and 300 but still great.
"Jan 8, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The dialog is the biggest weak point and most of the characters are a bit shallow. However the visuals, the atmosphere and overall feeling of this movie are awesome. The world and the story have a lot of potential and make it worth to watch. 
I'm looking forward to see what part 2 does with this stunning world."
"Jan 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"What a disappointment!, I only watched because of Snyder's name on it, and time wasted successfully."
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,I loved the visuals and action scenes. The art style is great as are all of Zack Snyders movies. That is the reason I'm giving it 4 stars. I came in expecting it to be pretty and fun to watch. The story and dialogue wasn't good but I knew it wasn't going to be. This movie entertained me enough to want to see the next one.
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"Have to admit it this way. I actually loved this film! I know some negative reviews are trying to be harshly against the film because it was ""Inspired"" by Seven Samurai and most other types of films, but honestly, which other films haven't been that way before? This however is definitely not a ""Rip-off"" of Star Wars at all, it is a completely different story compared to Star Wars. It appears such expectations were too high with not enough open minds to take it all in differently. At least I went into this film just open minded, lowering my expectations, without ""Nit Picking"" on parts of it like I used to. Because I enjoyed this for what it is and that's that. It's only a story to setup more happening in part 2, which made total sense. ""Rebel Moon Part 2: The Scargiver"" needs to hurry up though, because it will truly explain a lot more and go deeper. This is part 1 after all. It's a Two-Parter type of film, and patience is the key to slow-paced films like this. Hopefully more installments take place after."
"Jan 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This was a mess. Beautiful visually, but the plot, pacing, characters etc are all painfully boring. I really wanted to like this but it's some of the worst sci Fi I've ever seen."
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,Visually stunning! A good story and great ensemble of actors. It's everything the new Star Wars movies should be. This is the start of a big franchise.
"Jan 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I really wanted to like this film. There has been a desire among older Star Wars fans to see something more grown up, this should have been it, but sadly no. Whether it be the numb and pointless story or the flat and weird characters - Rebel Moon is a grab bag of pure awful. 
I also cannot understand the decision by a streaming service to offer a recut of a movie before it's even out - other than to somehow use it as a gimmick to earn more views. I'm not wasting more time watching an alternate cut when this has already been a truly rubbish viewing experience.
I need to go watch re-watch Andor to get this terrible taste out of my mouth."
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"I kept an open mind, understanding that there will be a part 2 that will complete the whole movie.  I thought the action sequence was great."
"Jan 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Wszystko tu jest co byƒá powinno ( tylko nie wiem wed≈Çug kogo )

"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"The movie is entertaining, the effects are good. The story could be better but that could be said about many sci-fi movies. Looking forward to part 2."
"Jan 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,It was really beautiful and completely devoid of anything worth your time. Did you feel like A Bug's Life needed more sexual assault? Then this might be for you.
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,"Good start to the franchise. Looking forward to the other movies, and for more context and characters."
"Jan 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I liked the action scenes. The characters need more backstory and dimension. This concept has some real promise, but the rushed pace makes me wonder if this woulda been a better episodic TV show rather than a movie. If you wanna shut off your brain for a couple of hours, it's a fun ride without much to think about and zero surprises due to lots of clunky telegraphing. That said, the world-building is ugly-beautiful. I like some eye candy in my science fiction, and this flick has lots of gorgeous backdrop with a well-worn, lived-in authenticity I could practically taste and smell; if only the storytelling had kept that kind of genuine flavor..."
"Jan 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,So boring and the the film did not make sense at all.
"Jan 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,I watched one episode and I was done. Not interested
"Jan 8, 2024",NEGATIVE,Kgada llena de slomo
"Jan 8, 2024",POSITIVE,Fantastic from beginning to end!
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"I can't believe how astounding this movie is and yet how many bad reviews it has received. It does follow 'The Seven Samurai/The Magnificent Seven,' set up, I love how it has that 'Spaghetti Western' grittiness to it, but that it also has a slower pace in storytelling. Watching this movie made me feel like I was reading a good novel. The flashes of reveals in Kora's past, the mystery over who killed the Royal Family, the glimpses of how the Imperium does things. It is so rich in cultures in its story-based universe.

I will say now that I am a HUGE Star Wars fan and I am happy to see another Space Opera coming out. So others comparing it to Star Wars and are angry that it is not Star Wars, need to chill. This is a different story. 

The CGI is smooth and enjoyed seeing the styles of the spaceships, I am so happy to see a griffin! Loved that part and loved the fight scenes - Kora can kick serious butt!

But anyway, despite what the haters say, Rebel Moon is a good movie with plenty of intrigue, lots of fights, and its story has a beginning, middle and an end that promises continuance into movie 2. Yes, the plot is familiar because it is a Sci-fi version of the Seven Samurai. Yes, we know what is going to happen next, but I simple can't wait for Part 2 and see what other twists Zack Synder comes up with."
"Jan 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"No original plot, dismal dialogue, mostly terrible CGI, tired action scenes. The dialogue is so bad that it's laughable, and not even experienced actors can save it. If I see another damned slo-mo fight scene I'm gonna wanna gouge my eyes out. What a mess."
"Jan 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Inicia con exceso de drama, terriblemente ""edgy"" malos di√°logos, predecible al aburrimiento"
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Tremenda producci√≥n tienen que verla.
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,23% rotten tomatoes?!? How!? Why?! It was amazing! I can't wait for part 2!!!!! Way better than Star Wars. Well done!
"Jan 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,Even though it has its visual stunning moments all of that eye candy gets lost in a pile of inconsistent narrative.
"Jan 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Some of it looked nice. So there's that.

Everything after leaving the farm was a mess. And the farm doesn't even make sense. 

It's derivative and nonsensical. Offers nothing new. I really hoped the professional critics were wrong. They were not."
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,The plot has its weak spots but cinematography is great and if you have a fully equipped surround sound with powerful base your whole room shakes and rumbles. I look forward to the second part even though I wished for a different ending. No spoilers!
"Jan 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It looked nice. That's it.
Awful script and acting.
Rehashed boring story. So many plot issues.
Costumes copied from 40k.
Anticlimactic final fight...I assumed there was more coming.
But we watched it all, and occasionally there was a nice side on shot.
Bonus star for Anthony Hopkins robot."
"Jan 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,Best viewed with a sci-fi trope bingo card and an understanding that you won't be shown but you will be told. Anthony Hopkins is the best part of this and I hope he gets more screen time in the sequel. Watch ut on a Sunday afternoon in a food coma.
"Jan 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,melodramatic spaceopera
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Solid sci-fi! Soooo happy they didn't give Rebel Moon the Star Wars treatment where in a an attempt to appeal to everyone it excites no one.  I liked it. Looking forward to next installment.
"Jan 7, 2024",NEUTRAL,Well it's probably like or don't like with this one. I found it entertaining and am curious for the 2nd part.
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,se unen ciencia ficci√≥n y acci√≥n en una pel√≠cula excelente con sonido espectacular..üòÅüëç
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Es una fantas√≠a total. Es un mundo que te quiere absorber con sus fragmentos complementarios de una historia subreal que quiere que viajes a ese universo y te quedes ah√≠ admirando sus mejores efectos y producci√≥n.
"Jan 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,No plot and the movie is all over the place
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"Una de las mejores pel√≠culas que he visto en toda mi vida, me atrajo tanto que podr√≠a volver a verla una y mil veces m√°s, est√° demasiado genial."
"Jan 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This is what happens when corporations with a corporate director decide that they can make money on garbage like this. Absolutely underwritten, underacted, over produced and hollow. You will not care for characters. Its just a smashed together mess of slow motion fabric to emphasize drama because all other aspects are lacking."
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Good film nice action and setting the scene for what I hope is an ongoing franchise.
"Jan 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie shows how to waste money on generic plot. 
Costium design was just bad. Another evil character in nazi uniform, another Asian character with sword. Rebels looking like vacnda forever...
Rest is just rip off from better movies. We have star wars here, Harry Potter, the last mohican and gladiator.
I knew this film will be bad, but still I was surprised how bad it was."
"Jan 7, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Rebel Moon Part 1 has some good visuals and passable performances from the cast. There was also a clear attempt to take the world-building seriously, which I appreciate, and it didn't go down the Marvel route of forcing inane jokes and zaniness on the audience every ten seconds in case boredom sets in (these desperate attempts at humour are often the most boring part). However, that's all the praise I can give. The film would've benefited a lot if the characters had more presence and personality, as few of them stood out as memorable. At one point there's a supposedly emotional moment where one of the good guys heroically sacrifices himself, but it has little impact given that we know nothing about him and his personality is 100% interchangeable with several other characters.  The story feel formulaic at times - go to planet, recruit another hero, dump some exposition, rinse, repeat - and there's nothing in the plot you won't have seen at least a hundred times before. So this movie doesn't have anything that marks it out as excellent, but it passes the time amiably enough if you don't expect too much from it."
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Que pel√≠cula tan hermosa que ense√±anza tan bonita nos deja la recomiendo v√©ala es buen√≠sima
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"La ense√±anza es extraordinaria, te pone a pensar..."
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Loved every bit of it!
"Jan 7, 2024",NEUTRAL,Nice Sunday movie. Enjoyed it and looking forward to part 2.
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Great Sci-Fi movie with good action
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"I would have liked to see the main characters fleshed out a little bit more, but an enjoyable movie nonetheless. Great action scenes and it sets the stage for more to come. I am looking forward to the next movie."
"Jan 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,Too much slow motion in inappropriate paces.
"Jan 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,I really wanted to like this movie and I really enjoyed the first 25 minutes but after they left the farm it became and absolute drag. Theres nothing redeeming even though it's glorious to look at. But you just simply don't care about what's going on.
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,"Fantastic space western. Edgier than Star Wars. Some room for more character growth, but otherwise loved it."
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Fast paced. Villans done well. Looking forward to part 2.
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,Awesome sci fi movie! Refreshing to see something different. People need to stop nitpicking and enjoy the ride!
"Jan 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I can't believe so much wasted money could go into such a horrible, predictable pick up quest of a movie.  Don't even get me started on the slow mo....or the accents (I won't name names)."
"Jan 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,This one evil guy just won't die very annoying
"Jan 7, 2024",NEUTRAL,"entertaining enough, good visuals , reasonable plot twist."
"Jan 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Rebel Moon was absolutely terrible. Copious amounts of slow motion just everywhere, the acting was on par with The Room. Setting, farming planet where people are dressed like they're from the 1800s even though space travel and laser guns are everywhere. Space Nazis land and demand most of their harvest! But these space pig farmers are ready for a fight! Queue in a space samurai for dramatic effect! It's an absolute disaster caught on film. With an all star cast like, Strong Female Role, Walgreens Brand Hugh Jackman and Anthony Hopkins Robot! Strap in for Rebel Moon, written by a five year old on Monster with an AI bot!"
"Jan 7, 2024",POSITIVE,It is good some things I think could have been cut and or replace some of the stuff was predictable.
"Jan 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Seriously, one of the worst movies ever made."
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"All the one star ratings gave me low expectations.  To my pleasant surprise the movie was better than expected and I will definitely watch part 2. I  want to thank all those one star negative reviewers, too bad you didn't like it ."
"Jan 6, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I liked the start , and the general outline of the story but film probably needed to be longer for more character development for us to have a connection to the characters and there fate at the end ,and main character her actor lacked any gravitas when she was trying to show anger or inspiration."
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"Zach ""Out Lucas's George Lucas"" in this movie...can't wait until the R rated version is released."
"Jan 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,Boring. Was expecting so much more. The visuals were fantastic but this was Star Wars: A New Hope in everything but name only. I was so looking forward to seeing the movie. Pity.
"Jan 6, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but I enjoyed it. Curious to see what they do with Part 2."
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,Visually stunning and a very fun watch. Plan for an intermission 1/2 way through. Can't wait to see part 2!
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,Amazing! Unsure why so many bad reviews. Great film. Great action scenes. Emotional. Deserves a much higher rating than it has.
"Jan 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,Cinematography is great but the writing and storyline is soooo bad. They really needed someone to edit/clean up this draft before it went to production. The dialogue is weird and cringe. Just overall a bad film and we really don‚Äôt need a part 2 & 3. 
"Jan 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,I could only stomach the first 20 minutes (that was too long to do that to myself) and I convinced ChatGPT wrote the script.
"Jan 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Great visuals, albeit way too much slo-mo, some nice sci-fi designs but a plot so thin it hardly counts as a story and not a drop of character development. 
Zack is great a visuals but not a good writer or storyteller because he never spends time between action scenes to get us to care."
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"Story is awesome, characters are great, and the movie looks fantastic.  Possibly best movie I saw this year, and one of Snyders best so far as well.  Excited for part 2 to come!"
"Jan 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,The script feels like it was written by AI. So messy..
"Jan 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"FX were good but just about every other aspect of the movie, the story, the characters, the gratuitous use of slow-mo,, we're bad!"
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,That's so epic wow ü§©
"Jan 6, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Honestly just alright. Don't think it's as bad as people say and also not as incredible as what was promised. It lacked a lot of character development but it was truly an ""assemble the team"" movie that included a lot of exposition. I think good things can come from this IP it just needs some time."
"Jan 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,Just alright‚Ä¶ terrible acting
"Jan 6, 2024",NEUTRAL,It is a nice Popcorn cinema. The first Part ist mostly buliding Charakters and a preparation for the second Part. Nothing wrong with it
"Jan 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,The dialogues... I just can't. Where are the real writers of Hollywood?
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this movie. It feels rare to see this level of world building in movies and especially world building done fairly well. The film did an excellent job showing rather than telling. And the characters felt like pivot points on a web connecting and expanding the universe. I am excited for the next in the series.
"Jan 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"If I had one good thing to say about this movie, I would put it here."
"Jan 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Huge fan of the genre, but the movie was boring and often nonsensical. The acting was poor too."
"Jan 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Cliched.  Trite.  Overworked.  If you want to watch a bad Star Wars, then watch anything after Return Of the Jedi.  Even they do better than this"
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,THIS MOVIE IS BADASS I LOVE SPACE AND THE ASS KICKING! I HOPE IN THE NEXT MOVIE OR WHATEVER THE GOOD GUYS WIN SPACE IS DOPE. THE ALIENS ARE HOT
"Jan 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I've never seen a worse film, to the credit of this film.  Not only is every scene a joyless exposition dump or a slo motion fight you've seen 100 times now; but many of the elements most bad movies do ok on are also done terribly here. The Cinematography is bad, the CGI is all over the place, the dialog is horrendous, and most of the sci-fi or fantasy elements are very very obviously ripped from Dune or Star Wars. You would think that if you got the chance to make a Sci-Fi and fantasy universe you'd make your own original things, but nope. The bad guys are a mix of Nazi's and Warhammer 40k; there are Griffins, and most of the plot is just a terrible and boring assembly trying to mimic Seven Samurai. 

Diarrhea is a better time than this."
"Jan 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,Story line was weak.  I'm surprised they made this movie.
"Jan 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"If some kid wrote a movie using scenes from their favorite films you would come out with something better than this. Seriously, the story is stolen from Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, The Seven Samurai (and every version ever made including A Bugs Life) Road Warrior Furious Road, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean,  Anastasia, and so forth. Then you do slow motion in every battle scene. You have zero backstory for any of the character so you can't name them or care when they die. And a lot of ""how convenient"" twists. Come up with ridiculous plot twists like an interstellar battle dreadnaught is brought down with a hand spear. And so forth and so on, sheesh. Oh and Focus! Focus!"
"Jan 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Disjointed. Rambling. Rutterless. A very, very poor attempt at trying to steal, then sniff, Lucas' junk-strap --  Soo... thousands & thousands of people died in a misguided effort to save 50 meaningless farmers... lead by a small band of misfits who all met in like a day... and risked their lives for... free?! I was so incensed, I actually signed up for Rotten Tomatoes just to save another life from wasting over two-hours of their lives scratching their head over this drivel. It seemed to have a decent budget, mostly wasted on endless slo-mo, when they should have hired some decent writers -- This is not the sci-fi you're looking for."
"Jan 6, 2024",NEUTRAL,Great production and performances by the cast but it seems so unnecessarily rushed and a mishmash of some pretty tired sci-fi tropes.
"Jan 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Bad acting, boring and predictable story, and overall just dumb. Not worth watching"
"Jan 6, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Not sure what the haters dislike about it. Most of them seem to think it fails in comparison to Star Wars which is one of the most overrated storylines in sci fi movie history. An enjoyable 2 hours with a clear beginning, middle and third act."
"Jan 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Cheesy dialogue which couldn't even be pulled off by the great actors involved. Storyline was nonsensical, like they tried to cram a whole miniseries into 2 hours. Might have been a little better if I had known the entire story before watching because they didn't give you enough story to understand what was going on. ""Fancy computer enhanced fight scenes does not a movie make."""
"Jan 6, 2024",POSITIVE,A great movie!!! One of the best I've seen on the last ten years. A must see for everyone.
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"Have some issues, but i really liked!"
"Jan 5, 2024",NEUTRAL,Painful to get into it. Overdone in my humble opinion but not the typical type of show I'd go for. Found it worth time spent in the end.
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"If you liked the movie 300, you will like this film too. I enjoyed the movie and am looking forward to the sequel and director's cut."
"Jan 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,Some of the worst writing and acting I have ever seen in a highly advertised movie. Worst movie I have seen in close to 10 years
"Jan 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It's so stupid you can't enjoy it... and despite what people say about Synder, this movie does not look good... cardboard sets everywhere... the rest is just slomo fights, slomo farming, slomo walking, slomo..."
"Jan 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,Sadly I had high hopes for this movie. Iflt had parts that were very cool then parts that bored me to tears. The scripted needed a rewrite and it could of been awsome. Ohh well. I will skip part too.
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"At first I was hesitant, but NOT too hesitant. So I had decided to check this movie and see it for myself (unlike some people who are too far in negativity and listen to just critics all the time these days). Movies don't have to be perfect, oscar worthy, or anything close, but this one was really good to see. I'm not sure what these 1 star low rating people were expecting at all. You expect almost too much and then you'll never like it. Probably not going to enjoy anything that's a simple movie. I went into it with lower expectations, and it paid off. Can't wait for part 2. Haters gona hate! But not me or many others around! YEAH! üëç"
"Jan 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Such a disjointed, sluggish, boring mess. The title should be called ""And Then‚Ä¶"" because it's just a bunch of random flashy lights stitched together devoid of charm, characters, or personality. I really wanted to love this movie but was so disappointed."
"Jan 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I watched the film in its entirety, but it wasn't a movie worth wasting popcorn on.

The beginning of the movie kept me engaged, but it lost me later on. Overall, Rebel Moon has boring and unimaginative characters, dialogue, and plot, topped with poor pacing and an overuse of slow motion. I feel as though the world-building has some potential, and despite my rating I'm interested on how the sequel will turn out."
"Jan 5, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This is a great way to kill boredom for a couple of hours.  Is it Oscar worthy??  No.  Do I care, no.  Liked it fine."
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"Let's not forget, this was originally pitched as a Star Wars movie, so move past the obvious parallels and see it for what it is. Yes, it's obviously derivative (reread my previous sentence) but it's an impressive attempt to move beyond being rejected by the franchise and carry on regardless. And Sofia Boutella is absolutely awesome in it. Yes, the Empire have been replaced by half arsed Nazi knock-offs and the back story is never adequately explained, but the action set pieces are really well executed. I really don't get the complaints about the amount of exposition, I can't say I noticed it being particularly dry and if you're world building some context is necessary. There are some ropey characters that let it down a bit but overall this was enjoyable. And the trailer for part 2 looks even better."
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,Excelente pel√≠cula todo un √©xito.
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved it. So many negative reviews nearly put me off. I sat back, watched it with zero expectation and thoroughly enjoyed it. For something with so many inspirations and an obvious plot, I honestly could wait to move from scene to scene. I think the fact it doesn't try to hide the story or the influences oddly gives it the freedom to be its own thing. 

Great bit of shameless fantasy in space. I think some people forget what makes a movie great."
"Jan 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,I don't know.  It has potential but the antagonists were a bit derivative.
"Jan 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Dreadful, forgettable, incomprehensible. I know what this film wants to be, but unfortunately, the film does not and struggles to be even a mediocre Star Wars rip off. I mean, Battle Beyond the Stars, the Roger Corman Star Wars rip from 1980 is an absolute master piece compared to Rebel Moon. This is not a rebellion worth joining."
"Jan 5, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Tent-poles of an idea with no actual story and rushed to conclude early with an unsatisfying ending. You spend the whole time waiting for a storyline that never comes. The movie started with a cheesy but perhaps promising premise, and went downhill fast. The use of freeze and slow effects were annoying and contributed nothing. The new character introductions were set across all different genres (including Western and Roman) and were timed exactly as they were completing some heroic action, strangely with no normal human reactions from the other people present, but they were cliche and predictable. Even the epic speeches were so cheesy it was painful, and nevermind their motivations. Everyone signing up with no money or incentive was just ridiculous and not thought out at all. Each scene seemed intended to push the story along as quickly as possible to get to the main battle with this elite super special team, but they shut the end of the story down early with the suddenness of a film that ran out of time or budget. It didn't leave any kind of cliffhanger or arc to give the disappointed viewer any interest in the next film. I haven't watched a film this bad in a long time."
"Jan 5, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Not the best, but definitely not the worst movie I've ever seen. Story needs more depth and the characters stories were not as intriguing as they could've been but I will watch part 2 when it comes out."
"Jan 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Poor story, a cliche"
"Jan 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,"From the very first seconds of the movie we can understand that it is going to be a total absurd. 20 farmers on a moon plowing soil using horselike animals, no electricity, no robots, no gadgets, and they trade their crop to intergalactic rebellion with spaceships, warpdrives and stuff. 
Acting, dialogue and the scrips at its weakest. Superslomotion is annoying and absolutely unnecessary."
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,entertaining sci-fi action
"Jan 5, 2024",NEUTRAL,Derivative? Yes. Entertaining? Yes.
"Jan 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,Terrible. Absolutely.
"Jan 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Easily the worst big budget  scfi / action movie i've watched. In my opinion there was no character development, which meant  i didn't care about any of the characters throughout the film. There were many slow motion scenes throughout the movie relating to character moments, suggesting those scenes were meant to be poignant, and suggesting the audience should feel something for the character in that moment, but i never did. In stead of world building, i would say it was simple location building, given nothing was explained about the different planets the movie introduced. Maybe a movie that would have worked with way more character development, or before gathering the hero team together, each character had already had there own movie, to fully establish there past and audience cared about who they are, endured and would bring to a team. I didn't think much of the CGI, where most of the movie appeared to have been shot on a green screen stage, and everything looked flat. Lastly the movie stakes, is one ship threatening a farm hamlet of maybe fifty inhabitants ( as seen in the movie). Not really the type of stakes i was expecting of a scfi movie pitched in the trailers as having a galactic enemy ""the Empire""

The movie was just awful."
"Jan 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It will never be an epic, but this movie is not 1 star or 24%. Google users give it 77% likes (a bit to high), but this movie is a solid 2.5 to 3 stars (50%-66%). Nice special effects, decent acting, good story but script could use way more work. We will see what the part 2 will bring. Sometimes I wonder if the ""professional reviewers"" are high or just blind. Good thing that these days I rather trust goigle reviews than some stucked up ""reviewer""."
"Jan 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Whoa, what an absolute stinker of a movie. There is no sense even going into it. I don't want to think about this movie anymore. Brain, just move that 2+ hours to repressed childhood memories, thank you very much."
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"I love this movie, i'm want to SEE the second part"
"Jan 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This first installment was rushed - and probably should have been a ten show season.  As it is, The characters jumped from place to place, having brief encounters with others, only to jump to the next location‚Ä¶. Frankly they could have filled in A LOT MORE activity at each location, and given the characters more heft.  As it is, it is passable.  The general story arc is good enough that if they had taken the 2 hour show and instead produced 10 -1 hour installments‚Ä¶ eg a full season of shows, this could have been an excellent tale."
"Jan 5, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It was enjoyable. You can tell this is the setup,get the band together installment. This is not a Star Wars movie. If you are expecting that, you'll be disappointed. 

If you like SciFi you'll enjoy this. Can you pick it apart. If you want to. Just sit back and enjoy this for what it is. A new SciFi world with characters I hope they expand on."
"Jan 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie is like watching a drunk toddler try to explain Star Wars.
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,Must watch! Cannot wait for the superior version!
"Jan 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Half way into it and its ok. The ‚ÄúDEI‚Äù characters makes me think this is a Disney movie. Pretty lame. This is not like a true star wars movie. Maybe similar to 7, 8, & 9 but those were garbage. Even this better than those."
"Jan 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie takes the worst of many sci-fi tropes and ruins them forever. Is there any original ideas left in Hollywood? How did this movie ever get made? See Seven Samurais and view the masterpiece in it's original form. I hope part two never gets released!
"Jan 5, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie borrows far to much from other sci Fi movies. Although it had a lot of potential it didn't reach expectations. it's beginning is strong to build a world but it loses all sense once they reach the 30 minute mark, If you really still want to watch a movie like it, watch Star Wars.Also, I really hope that the second part can redeem this movie."
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"It's part 1, it's all build up but anyone who knows the story of the seven samurai know what they are watching. Incredible movie. Looking forward to part 2!"
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,Read the bad reviews and watched it anyway.  I enjoyed it and it was nice to see something relatively original and I look forward to part2.
"Jan 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Usualmente me entretengo con casi cualquier pel√≠cula de ciencia ficci√≥n porque la mayor√≠a intenta ser coherente, pero este no es el caso. El gui√≥n de Rebel Moon no es solo simpl√≥n sino que atenta contra la l√≥gica. Por si fuera poco piratea ideas y escenas de otras pel√≠culas, malas y buenas, so pretexto de que est√° rindi√©ndoles un tributo cuando lo √∫nico que hace es robar con descaro. Y  ni que decir de las cargantes escenas en c√°mara lenta que se llevan un tercio del metraje. En suma, una pel√≠cula sofocante y dif√≠cil de ver. Absurda hasta lo indecible. La dej√© de ver faltando 15 minutos. Me importa un bledo como concluye."
"Jan 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A movie with an interesting universe, but absolutely horrendous pacing. It feels as if someone wrote a season script for a TV series, then took the footage and concenced it into a feature length film. The action is solid, but also ludicrous. 

I am not watching Part II, but if they make a TV show set in this universe I might take another look at the universe on offer."
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Splendid visuals, asperous yet beguiling music, grounded characters, medieval yet very grandiose atmosphere, decent plot. 10/10."
"Jan 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I don't understand how anyone could enjoy this movie. It's just a bunch of recycled scenes from other bad blockbuster movies. There are tons of plot holes, and that's saying something because the movie barely has a plot to begin with."
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Excelente pel√≠cula de acci√≥n, para verla mil veces"
"Jan 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,Que pedazo de porquer√≠a acabo de ver. Una obra maestra sobre como desperdiciar decenas de millones de d√≥lares haciendo cine mediocre.
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Excelente pel√≠cula de un estilo muy futurista donde los personajes se entremezclan los villanos tienen sus caracter√≠sticas y un tema que une lo post apocal√≠ptico y de supervivencia en donde relata nuevamente la sublevaci√≥n que tiene un pueblo cuando se ve amenazado por un poder mayor que es el que lo subyuga
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Atractiva pel√≠cula sus escenas impresionante,efectos de lo mejor."
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"I think the movie delivers what it promised. The story in this first part of Rebel Moon is somewhat shallow but filled with good intentions. Anime and science fiction enthusiasts will be thrilled by the breathtaking scenes.

The visuals truly captivate, offering a feast for the eyes. The characters, while not deeply explored in this installment, show potential for growth and complexity in future parts of the series. The film successfully captures the essence of both anime and sci-fi genres, creating a visually stunning experience that resonates with fans.

However, a more intricate plot development could enhance the overall storytelling. Despite its current simplicity, the film sets the stage for potential expansion in subsequent installments. The combination of stunning visuals and the promise of deeper narratives leaves audiences eager for what comes next in the Rebel Moon series."
"Jan 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Felt like watching an episode of mediocre Star Wars bootleg that don't deliver. Failed to deliver emotion, under average choreography. Lazy writing."
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Es una pel√≠cula super f√°bulosa entretiene desde el. Primer momento en que la vez la. Super recomiendo por la gran actuaci√≥n que tienen los personajes... Aparte de eso ense√±a mucho sobre la vida cotidiana.
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie. Almost like Dune but more action.
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Me la Vi con unas gafas y la verdad es que todo va super nada feo todo de calidad que buena peli
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Una pel√≠cula 10/10 s√∫per recomendada
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Full throttle Sci Fi epic movie that manages to actually have a great story, wonderful characters, actors that make them seem real, and special effects that enhance the cinematic experience rather than overwhelm it.  I know there are a lot comparisons to Stars Wars, however, to me this is much better, and a little more akin to the The Expanse.  My only disappointment is only two movies. Really would have liked to have a one time eight to ten episode mini series, where the story could delve deeper."
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Las escenas de accion y los efectos especiales son magnificos,se mezcla la fantasia y la realidad de una manera sublime al punto de que no te quieres safar de la pelicula"
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Esta gran pel√≠cula nos lleva  a una galaxia lejana para ser testigos de una batalla √©pica que vale la pena ver.
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Que hermosura de pelicula, que buenos personajes tiene, que buenos dialogos tiene, que buena animaci√≥n tiene, simplemente es hermosa esta pelicula, muy buen trabajo por parte de la produccion."
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"On fireüî•esta que arde super estreno, no puedes perdertela!"
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"visually striking and powerful, the world building and introduction to all of the characters and their unique personalities, abilities and pasts was perfect meanwhile also telling and moving through the story, the pacing was very smooth. 

the creatures, as they travelled to the different Moons in search of other Rebels, were intense, beautiful and one of them rather spine chilling at first glance (Harmada) but in a way i also felt for her too, to be scared but also sympathize is something the directions did very well here. 

i have to admit my favourite scene was a beautiful moment that made me tear up between Jimmy and Sam by the river when he was telling her about Princess Issa, how she reminded him of her, and you could see how broken he was that he was not able to protect Issa in the way he was programmed to as she was killed. The way Sam sat, completely immersed in what he was saying, but also making a flower crown from daisies, and placed them on his head, it melted something inside of him. She showed him warmth and kindness, and i think in the future films / film, he will be Sam's biggest protector. 

a really beautiful and visually dazzling movie filled with action but also holds these delicate moments where you really fall in love with the characters. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Jan 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I normally enjoy science fiction, even bad science fiction. I was expecting to enjoy this but it was.....bad. The script and dialog are just horrible. It's disjointed and just feels really pointless. It's like the worst parts of the modern star wars movies but with any remaining charm sucked out. The characters are incredibly one dimensional, it just feels like a sci-fi movie designed by an AI."
"Jan 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,Nothing short of a disaster.

"Jan 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Shut it off after 30 minutes. I was rolling my eyes at ham fisted characters, poor character decisions and cliche tropes. I'm not interested in wasting my time on poorly written shows anymore"
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Interesting characters, good pacing. Yes, it's kinda sorta like Star Wars but that is not necessarily bad. It kept me awake, which 95% of movies I watch do not. I have watched many well reviewed bad movies. This is a poorly reviewed good one."
"Jan 4, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Rebel Moon looks absolutely fantastic. However, it feels like somebody put all sci-fi tropes in an AI blender and this movie is what came out."
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"a bit heavy handed and too many girl bosses, but otherwise pretty fun....better than disney era star wars"
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,Visually stunning lacking depth see where 2 goes
"Jan 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Seriously, the writing is rubbish and the story is pathetic. This needs some serious work."
"Jan 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"To be brutally honest, this is by far the most badly and lazily written plot I've seen in a while with some of the most underwhelming character development to ever serve as contrast for other films.

the very obvious copy paste writing of too many elements from other movies that don't make sense was the absolute worst.

Visual effects and actions scenes were okay."
"Jan 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Unethical garbage. Not only is it one of the worst written things to have been conceived in quite some time, but it's also unabashedly unethical in how it excessively plagiarizes other's works and how it presents itself as a ""movies as a service."""
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Looks like people just want to bash the director than watch the movie. The movie is entertaining it‚Äôs a space adventure movie. People talk about pacing and editing, it‚Äôs not that hard to follow people. It‚Äôs a fun entertaining movie that‚Äôs all it is to it. "
"Jan 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,Boring and dragged out. Awful acting.
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,It's like Star Wars for people who don't need forced cute product placement.
"Jan 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,Una pel√≠cula que parecen fracciones de historias que intentan relatar algo que nunca sucede.
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Overall, I thought it was a really good movie,  Worth watching. An alternative to starwars"
"Jan 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"not only was this a sad attempt to replicate star wars, it was a waste of time and money for everyone involved. the dialogue is a joke, the characters are shallow, and the cgi looks like it wasn't fully developed or finished. not to mention the random slo-mo moments during fight scenes render any seriousness completely ridiculous. at first i thought this was based on a video game because the amount of lore dumping in this is insane. however impressively enough, despite the dumping, you spend the entire movie wondering what the hell is going on. i'm giving this half a star because it won't let me give it no stars, but honestly it deserves half a start for impressing me with its cataclysm of confusing plot line."
"Jan 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,Formulaic sci fi garbage. Bored me enough that i didnt even finish it
"Jan 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I believe someone lost a bet and had to make the worst movie possible. It needed to come with those three dudes sitting in front of it from mystery science theater. Horrible acting, dialogue was beyond stupid, terrible music, the fight scenes make WWE look realistic. Other than that it's great."
"Jan 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Pooooooooor script. Too much slow motion. Zero charisma.
Too bad for Charlie Hunnam, totally wasted...he deserves better movies."
"Jan 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Filme Pessimo filme, Zeca bora fazer escola pra cinema"
"Jan 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,If you want to see this movie good luck enjoying it worst movie of the year
"Jan 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie had so much potential but it wasted it. The basis for the plot is...The big empire from earth goes to the outer planets to find some rebels and harassers a small farming village of like 40 people. The farmers go out to find other people who want to defend them from the empire... which is the majority of the movie going to location and picking up people. My whole issue with it is that the people they pickup are just some randos with no story and no reason to join helping these few farmers when they have nothing to give them as a reward. The whole plot is dumb.
What they could of done is make the movie into an exponential plot which keeps increasing the scope like Gurren Lagann;  Help a farm, save a city, defend a planet, galaxy at war...."
"Jan 4, 2024",POSITIVE,"Look, it's not a cult or a classic... we've all seen the plotlines before. It is though, a great mindless bit of very well executed sci fi drama. Ed Skrein in particular puts in a gloriously OTT performance as the archetypal sadistic villain. It's just Entertainment folks, fast paced and punchy. The over harsh critics need to see this film while wearing the right glasses. Perhaps they can be excused as the film does occasionally vear towards delusional pretensions of grandiosity. If you ignore this you are left with a terrific action adventure to settle down into and enjoy."
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Great movie! The only thing I didn't like was the slo no action scenes! Way too many of them of overall good film!
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This was a hard watch. Personally I'm a huge fan of fantasy sci-fi films but this was a struggle. The dialogue was like a copy/paste version from other films of the style, the slo-mo shots were too long, too many and unnecessary. What worked well in 300 doesn't work here. The theme of ""explaining who people are"" was painful to sit through. Unlikely to bother with the sequel."
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,this movie sucked tbh
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A movie to define the word ""bland"""
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This film felt as if it were just a collection of action sequences interspersed with lackluster dialog. The plot was one that has been seen a thousand times before and the visuals that cost so much money fluctuated between mediocre and downright awful. Some cgi felt akin to cutscenes from a decade old video game. Much like the Hobbit trilogy the poor use of visual effects really takes you out of the film. 

Ed Skriens performance was the only part of the film I enjoyed. Although he was let down by the material he was given. 

It beggars belief that anyone greenlit this woeful production."
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,Uninspired tech demo. Unengagin story & characters. Maybe I'm just getting too old for american good vs. evil type of movie...
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Fun, exciting and compelling characters. Some say it borrows too much from other films but I wasn't bored or taken out of this movie once. You could see how it would have fit into the Star Wars universe but this is honestly better than anything Star Wars has put for a while."
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Amazing! It makes you think that even when everything is lost, you can try again, and others will follow you. Visuals and efects are outstanding!"
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I'm sorry but this movie is bland, unaspiring and can't hold a candle to Star Wars."
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Cool visuals but what a bad story line, poor dialogues, bad acting, bad stunts full of ineptitude."
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie looks downright silly with all of the unnecessary slow motion, overdone character shots and tropey looking aliens and space nazis. Honestly, this seems like a parody, rather than a real movie. The story is bland, the character motives non-existent and the dialog is pure cringe."
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Overall very disappointing. Despite being quite interesting in the early scenes as we meet the characters but soon goes downhill. Comically pantomime nazi villains. Poorly directed actors emoting all over the place and being allowed to do their best ""epic"" performances. 
Being a Star Wars type space fantasy where a ragtag band of rebels take on the established order against the odds isn't necessarily the problem‚Ä¶ if this had any charm, characters we cared about, or the feeling anything really was at stake other than the next slow-no action sequence it could have been fine."
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie was excellent. Amazing visual effects. Strong ending. Loved the characters. If you're looking for something to watch with a friend or family this is a great choice. Ignore the critic reviews they are all miserable people.
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,The movie was all over the place with inconsistent story-telling and poor plot development. Hours were spent introducing new characters for no reason. Very predictable moments and a poor ending. Too much emphasis on dramatic moments prior to cutting away to a new scene.
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Imagine the worst Star Wars rip off you can imagine.  You have that in your head now?  Okay, now, make it worse."
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Muy buena pelicula recomendada y muy buena cinematogr√°fia 10/10
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Is this a perfect movie, no. Is it confusing at time, yes. It's a new story so of course it is. This movie reminded me of playing Mass Effect. This movie has upside and very entertaining. Is it for everyone probably not. I'm invested and think people should give it a chance!"
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Un ni√±o rebelde, s√∫per genial intrigadora para compartir con familia y amigos"
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,Not that great of a movie. huge disappointment. But this is par for the course now. These directors want their movies to look good without actually being good. The characterization and story/plot are just bottom tier child's play. Dont waste your time.
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Honestly this film is major chore to watch. It wasn't till the 3rd watch through I was able to pay attention. The film really doesn't know what it is, StarWars, WoW and Narnia combined into an amalgamated mess that hurts the soul to watch. 
Snyder shot for the moon but fell down the stairs with this one."
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Overall an OK movie, some of the action scenes could have been better, the movie feels a bit rushed. I am looking forward to part 2."
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Turned it off after 25 minutes. Poor acting, corny story. Not for me."
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,It is a very uninteresting story line and the aliens are an insult to all imaginable life forms.
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"if you like characters with a depth of a puddle, plenty of bland settings, cookie cardboard villains and slow motion of slow motion slowed into oblivion, you might get a few good moments out of this. Otherwise, if you are looking for entertainment, give yourself a papercut - I can guarantee you will have more fun with it than watching this something."
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"If you are thinking about watching it, don't because it is a waste of time. Everything after the first 30 minutes was super rushed. So many new characters are introduced and join the team without any good reasons and the character development is not existent. Do not recommend."
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It feels like it was written by a 9 yo... I thought it would be nice but the storyline is a mess, no affection was made with the characters, boring cliche story progression."
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Star wars vibes,  great casting and i really liked the whole movie."
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"So Blend. Poor action choregraphy; it makes NO SENSE and NOT EXPLAINED why a 130 lbs girl beats 8 200 lbs soldiers by herself. They have guns, she doesn't. No plan, simply suicidal and brooding the whole movie. The movie takes 1 hour to start, then the next 30 minutes they have 8 new friends ready to die for a unexplained cause. I finished it only hoping it would get better..... But no. 
And the races/world is boring or disgusting. 
Such a waste of money and opportunity to make something good and long-lasting."
"Jan 3, 2024",NEUTRAL,Stars Wars copycat.  It was okay but nothing special.  And the villain character doesn't even come close to Darth Vadar.  When you are trying to copy and fail that much it takes away from the story.  They tried to top Star Wars instead of just creating a new story.
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,Um Star Wars ruim e com muita c√¢mera lenta!
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I was really looking forward to Rebel Moon. Whilst it looked pretty, the storyline was awful.  I managed 30 minutes first time around. Whilst the lead character was great, her companions were just so dull and out of place. Gave it another go and managed to get to the Borg Queen fighting the Jedi Samurai before giving up again. It will probably appeal to Harry Potter fans more than Star Wars fans."
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,I want to use M.I.B Neuralyzer to go back to the way I was before watching this...
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,It 3:48 am and I stayed up the whole night to watch this! I dunno what's wrong with humans or where y'all state of mind is but this was AMAZING! I definitely want more! Great way to start the new year. I hope theres more to come! Just excellent to watch I'd rate it 10 stars if I could. Definitely a must watch!
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,Had so much potential
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not a complete waste of time, but besides the visuals, there is nothing to it. The story is flat, full of cliches. I am not sure I will watch part 2."
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"EXCELLENT
COSTUMES!! So many favorites I can't decide. The CINEMATOGRAPHY had EPIC SHOTS hands down. The STUNTS were well thought. I loved how they gave more emphasis to a female lead in part one. The Special Effects was wonderful. It gave me Star Wars or Mandalorian vibes."
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,I really enjoyed laughing at the reviews I read while watching this unfortunately terrible film. I love sci-fi and I wanted to love this. I do feel bad for the writers. Visually rad but so so dumb.
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"The film definitely borrows thematically from historical science fiction westerns like Star Wars and Dune, but I don't see that as a negative. I really enjoyed the film, and I especially enjoyed the universe it is creating. If you are looking for a science fiction world to be created in film with action and the classic oppressors vs the opressed, you will enjoy this. I grow tired of ""lack of character development"" arguments from film critics regarding every sci-fi film, because they are complaining about something which is of minor relevance to what this film is supposed to be. It is not tied to a specific character's development. It is creating a universe. These same ""character development"" critics probably complain that a jeep wrangler isn't refined. If you want refined, buy a Mercedes. You buy a Jeep for the ruggedness. If you want a ton of character development, watch a historical fiction drama. If you want a new scifi universe, watch this film."
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,A bit confusing to start. Sci-fi and fantasy movies are generally poorly reviewed but I thought I'd watch this anyways and I thought it was great. Less childish than starters. I would love to see more character development but overall I found it to be very entertaining. Excited for the next one.
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,What a visual spectacle!!! A fantastic story and reat action
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I still didn't  understand what the movies is trying to show...its starwars, Harrypotter, gladiator, 300 all mixed up visually.... We see bits and pieces of every civilization of earth....the movie lacks imagination and story"
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was better than expected.. 
I really hope they release the extended cut."
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"again, a female protagonist front and center...very tired of this trope thats been forced upon us for the pass 15 years....and in a very poorly written and acted story"
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"If you are up to watch good punching fights and muscles , this is your movie"
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Great movie , everyone I asked loved it an exiting movie till the end of part 1, Five üåü"
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,"Totally awesome, story's a bit dull and the fights scenes need more juice,but the overall visuals are absolutely stunning"
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A movie written by AI text generator.   It is shapeless and senseless, without a compelling plot or characters we care for in the slightest."
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"An absolute waste! As a huge sci-fi fan I went into this movie with excitement and hope for something completely new. How often do you get to see an entirely new world with this type budget and cast behind it? But this movie was so disappointing. There was no story, nothing new or interesting at all. Just copy paste from a bunch of other stories. There are parts of the movie that are visually very stunning but that's not enough to make up for how bad the writing is."
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Garbage. A critic called it ""derivative"" and wow were they correct."
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it...  Could use less dei posturing as it doesnt need it.
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,Great visual effects and poor script... ALL plots are very previsible and the character development is full of holes.
"Jan 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It's kind of fitting that the best character in this movie is a robot, because while Rebel Moon has interesting visuals it lacks humanity. Ironically that robot possesses what little humanity exists and once he leaves shortly after the first act gets going it's all downhill from there. 

The bulk of the movie is a planet-hopping recruitment drive for NPCs. Each has a name, a micro-vignette where they demonstrate the functionality they bring to the party, and a brief dialog tree that, once clicked-through (alas, no ""skip"" button is available) adds them to the group. Then they fade into the background, never to be heard from or interacted with again--except to take their turn in each round of combat, sometimes accompany their attack action with a random bark of NPC dialog. 

Cool-looking armor and 5-minutes with a charming Tin Man are not enough reason to sit through this film. Skip."
"Jan 3, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's an enjoyable movie, just for super fans of the genre.
The FX are good enough and the fighting scene are fast.
Unfortunately the plot it's way too basic, and the characters had literally zero characterisation. For a movie wich bet more than half run time in recruiting characters they didn't do a minimum effort in give them a proper introduction, it's all very rushed like, they meet they talk 1 minute to each other and they get convinced to join the cause. Not plausible at all."
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,Absolute dog sh*t! I almost never can't find something to relate to or enjoy‚Ä¶ this movie was a colossal disaster.
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Nah. VFX are goods. I felt DIZZY on every minutes of SLOWMOTIONS LOL. The main character, MEH,

Other cast MEH, story, SUPER MEH. 2HRS or BASIC STORY TELLING."
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The film, solely featuring aesthetically pleasing and hence sometimes uninteresting actors, encounters challenges in its direction. The execution falls short, with issues in blocking and timing affecting the overall cinematic experience. The narrative setup lacks the necessary differentiation and depth, rendering it somewhat simplistic and naive. The portrayal of culture appears to be approached with a somewhat idealized perspective, resulting in a cookie-cutter representation. Furthermore, the characters, unfortunately, come across as one-dimensional and predictable.

One is left pondering the significant craftsmanship and time invested in the creation of the story. However, the absence of a robust foundation in world-building and emotional relatability diminishes the impact of these efforts. A more comprehensive exploration of these aspects could have elevated the overall quality of the film.

Regrettably, due to the aforementioned shortcomings, I found it challenging to immerse myself fully in the film, ultimately leading to an incomplete viewing experience."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"It was good,great story and good visuals.I think it deserves better critics that's why i'm ranking it 4.5 ."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Some of the character development is a bit...rushed, but this fever-dream mismash of  sci-fi is pretty and engrossing.  The character development is a bit rushed, but the general flow of ideas and worldbuilding is pretty spot on.  I would like to see both the directors cut and second part of this series, and will recommend it to my friends.

Upon a bunch of further introspection, I think I get why this movie is so divisive.  I think perhaps the professional critics and a fair bunch of the non-professionals are pretty uninspired by this film, because they want to take it as an individual piece of art, and a complete work.  This is the new normal, where a production house can take ten or twenty hours to deliver a story that once had to be encapsulated in 120 minutes or less.

This has to be viewed through the lens knowing that this film is only the first part of the narrative, and a truncated version at that.  When you only get to see the first act, you only get exposition and not the character development or building that will happen in the second act, and the full heros journey wont complete until the third.

I think the reviewers here that think this movie is great are viewing with this episodic lens.  I know that watching this, I know that there are further episodes coming, and I am curious to see how the story develops and what ideas will be presented later on.  I am also anxious to see the full release of this episode later, as this will also reveal the true vision of this first act, hidden here by the PG13 rating requirements.
"
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"we are in luck because of the dazzling visuals, very nice! It is also the only thing that kept me watching, since the plot is so focking bad. it's like a speed run for the most clich√©s in 1 movie. This feels like a collection of every storytelling aspect i hate. Characters are given personalities that are totally not explored and feel very unnecessary, running through the story and leaving immersion and depth at the side. The plot could be so much easier but they made it complicated, wich is not a problem. But please do enlighten us with the complexity of your universe and story. It feels like skipping from branch to branch. 
BAD CLICH√â, BUT NICE CGI"
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not sure where to start. The story, screenplay, acting & characters all seem horrendously shallow, cheesy and cringe. It's basically a kids films story with a PG13 theme which underdelivers and therefore isn't one or the other as the depth feels extremely watered down. They planet hop to spend 15 minutes on a supposedly secondary character for them to only have 3 more lines for the rest of the film. There are times where I don't think the main characters speak for extended periods of time. I liked the world building around the current story, the flashbacks and the aesthetics but everything else is a huge miss. Even the action feels janky and stupid with their huge lean on slow motion. I have no idea how they were comfortable publishing this. The reason I'd watch the second one is to see how much worse that is."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Der Film hat mir gut gefallen. Vieles wurde kopiert, aber alles in allem ist er sehenswert."
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"More effort was placed into making this film look pretty than anything else. Defend your settlement from raiders - Fallout 4, go on a quest to gather a host to defend your settlement - D&D, A Bug story. Throw in a forgettable cast, a slice of every sci-fi IP out there and you have this movie... also...

I am pretty sure this movie is taking a big ol' dump on Warhammer 40k in hope of putting a negative light on the franchise. Belisarius? Mechanicum?! REAALLY?!! I am expecting to see Spacemarines, the Inquisition and Titans in the next chapter. 

My eyes were exhausted and I got vertigo from all the eyerolling and cringe... Pretty but dumb so pretty dumb."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is a film that serves its purpose. Nothing more, nothing less. To say it's great or terrible is nonsense. This is a flawed but entertaining piece of sci-fi. 
The Silver Motion"
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A pale imitation technically nice, but philosophically empty...All the historical influences from Cinese Ming Empire to Greeks, to USSR to NAZIS to Zoulous to american gold rush are melted in that movie!"
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,Zack Sander does it again. (Not in good way)
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Too much pathos, zero humour, mediocre acting and storyline. Should have stayed in the farmers' village, the only likeable characters were there. Feels like a videogame...(("
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,What is the point of this film?
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,Haven't  seen the movie but I know it sucks 'cause Synder sucks
"Jan 2, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The film's visuals are good, but the amount of elements based on trendy films from recent decades was exaggerated. The story was shallow, no different from the fashionable space adventure films of the last five years. But the twist at the end and the outcome I found interesting, it motivated me to see what comes next."
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Slightly interesting in the beginning but from then on, the story and the acting just goes downhill. Way too much color, and as in most of Snyders films, too much color and effects that just feel like an attempt to cover up poor storytelling and shallow characters."
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Cinematography and action scenes were good. No story line to tie or show character motivations.. just paint by numbers when assembling the ""heroes."" A lot of potential with the story, but didn't feel fully fleshed out, hope Part 2 will improve."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Weak plot, like seriously ... however great visuals and music! Decent movie overall but nothing special. Its not one of them movies that you would like to rewatch."
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,Knew it was going to be bad 5 minutes in but watched anyway. Please may I have the two hours of my life bad. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Only good scene was a combat robot shooting a bad guy in the head without aiming. Truly horrendous in all respects
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,It seems like it was written by a 11 year old who saw Star Wars and heard about Seven Samurai. Both long and rushed somehow. There is no difference in the walrus assembled other than how they look.  Also the Empire can fire from low orbit so what are warriors with swords and guns going to do? A single peak mountain with water falls .. where's the water coming from? Bland and every style of clothes is found on earth.
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"I have been very disappointed with movies for the past few years. Rebel Moon brought something fresh and interesting. I enjoyed the story, the action and the acting. I wish they would have just released the director's cut first. I cannot wait for part 2."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"It's a good movie.  Yes it has a somewhat star wars vibe.... and maybe other fantasy movies.  Give it a try with an ope mind instead of expecting to hate it. 
Most movies being put out these days aren't good.  This one was.  Some people are just bitter and can't enjoy a movie.  These people giving it one star will still most likely be watching part 2.   They have to know what happens. 

I'm not getting the comparison with the robots to star wars.  Transformers maybe... in the what was it.  5th one?  Star wars.. no.  They're also not really in the movie much..."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Once you accept there are no truly original ideas and that every story draws upon the many that came before‚Ä¶ you can set aside your high horse and ask yourself, ""was I not entertained?"" This universe was visually captivating and the story was exciting. The characters had as much depth as possible in less than 2 hrs (not a whole lot) but still had me rooting for/ against them. ""A Child of Fire"" has me excited for Part 2 and is worth watching for any fan of sci-fi and action/adventure."
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I am not sure I have the vocabulary to describe how bad this film is. 

The script is more banal than a three year old's storybook, the plot is a hackneyed take on Stars Wars mixed with the Magnificent Seven and the characterisation is non-existent, leaving the viewer not caring at all who lives and who does not.

Add to that the feeling that the Universe has now become the Wokeverse and it is a movie to avoid at all costs."
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"A bunch of stuff happens to people no one cares about. 

Rebel Moon is one of those movies that focuses more on visual appeal than telling a story people care about. It's far too plot driven while the characters sit in the sidecar. It's not worth watching beyond the first act which was just ok."
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Disappointing‚Ä¶ for an original‚Ä¶ it seemed anything but‚Ä¶ imagine a mix of Dune, Star Wars, and the Kriptonian design of ships & a costumes from Man of Steel with a HEALTHY dose of the pandering that was referenced in South Parks ‚ÄòPanerverse' episode & super cheesy tropes‚Ä¶. And that's my best summation of this one. Wildly disappointing & don't think I'll invest another 2 hours to see part 2."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"While character development might be lacking in the second act, ""Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire"" is a visually stunning and action-packed film with good worldbuilding. I look forward to seeing what happens next."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,The film is solid. The visuals are great. The critics are either stupid or full of hate. Maybe both. üòÇ

"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Its just a boring combination of other movies, but at least some nice visual effects - still it generates zero excitement, I will skip part 2."
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"One dimensional characters with absolutely not a thing as depth or credibility.
Mostly awful universe.
""Empire"" acting like bullies on a small random village for no reason. Villain acting like a spoiled child (and this is hard to see). Trained soldiers acting like a school drama. 
People joining the crew with no reason whatsoever. Even the action parts are mediocre at best. Bits of story everywhere, that could have been fleshed out but were not.
I find it disturbing to know that a lot of people have been paid for making this thing."
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Truly terrible, each character introduced gets about 2 minutes of screen time before joining the rebellion, and that's about all the character building you can expect from this movie.

The romance if it can be called that is shown by a few impassive glances.

The action scenes are unfortunately no better pointless lasers flying around while main characters stand in the open waving around sticks and swords.

The only positive is in its unrealised potential, as a world it shows a few glimpses of an expensive and interesting universe that could have been but never will."
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Sendo bem sincero, achei mais do mesmo do que j√° tem por a√≠. At√© o filme ""A Batalha de Riddick"" √© muito mais legal e interessante que este do Zack. Este filme da pra ver o quando o Zack s√≥ √© mais ou menos de dirigir, pq roteiro ele os demais, passam longe viu. Os atores, meu Deus do c√©u! Muito fracos! O mais legal de todos que n√≥s faz ter empatia √© o Rob√¥ que desaparece do nada. O vil√£o e uma salsicha cozida na √°gua tem o mesmo efeito. 

S√©rio mesmo que a galera pira com as c√¢mera leta do Zack, tenho certeza que ele tentou copiar Bollywood, que s√£o expert em C√¢mera lenta e excelentes fotografias. Por√©m n√£o aprendeu nada, umas c√¢mera linda sem sentido e sem time, parece quando a gente v√™ um v√≠deo onde o √°udio t√° fora de sincronia. (Tipo: ""Acho que essa c√¢mera lenta ele queria usar na cena passada ou cena seguinte, mas acho que sincronizaram no tempo errado"", foi assim que vi as chatas c√¢meras lentas).

O filme t√£o falado parece que chegou 20 anos atrasado para o tanto de criatividade j√° existente nos dias atuais. Bem que quando vi o trailer, j√° fiquei com -10 de empolga√ß√£o, ou seja, o filme entregou o que trailer prometia, ZERO."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Thin characters, yes. But still an enjoyable ride"
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,It had great visuals but I was very bored it was basically a bunch of short stories and overly done slow motion scenes
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I saw direct rip offs of Star Wars, Serenity, Starship Troopers and Lara Croft all in the first 15 minutes. Not a single original idea in it, all with Snyder's usual visual tropes. Won't be watching any directors cut and certainly no sequel."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,Great watch. Dark and very entertaining. Miles ahead of recent marvel / superhero garbage coming out lately. Looking forward to part 2.
"Jan 2, 2024",NEUTRAL,Good action film - not much plot but good characters.
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Yes it borrows some elements from other movies but I don't think it is as horrible as others say, it's hard to maka a classic ""fight an evil empire"" story without doing something that's already been done.
My biggest grief is that the soldiers left to guard was over the top evil, to obvious. Apart from the above, a solid movie with stunning visuals. Enjoy!"
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,Bad story telling. Super bad effects
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,Worst than I thought it would be.  It felt like a too serious version of Star Wars without any memorable characters or a resemblance of a coherent storyline.  Boring and not what I expected.  Pass on this one.
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The story was formulaic and predictable. The villains were space Nazis. Certain plot points made no sense. Overall, there was too much cringe."
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Corny and disjointed. It lacks the ability to anchor the viewer within the story. There are some visually pleasing scenes, but they do not make up for the rest of the heap."
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The worst movie I've seen in recent memory. I heard it was a rejected Star Wars movie pitch and it shows; The world-building is lazy and uninspired, mostly delivered through excessive and tedious exposition and monologues. The story is yet another shameless ripoff of ""Seven Samurai"" with a random collection of sci-fi tropes thrown in for good measure. Two-dimensional characters and wooden acting are the final nail in the coffin. I stopped and started the movie about four times trying to give it a chance and hoping it would get good, I turned it off with about 20 minutes left because I couldn't bear it anymore."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,It's nice to have a regular schmegular hero's journey movie that's sci-fi. They haven't made anything epic since the early 2000s. Ignore critics if you're a regular person. They like Atonement. ü§ÆEnough said.
"Jan 2, 2024",NEUTRAL,Good movie. Funny and great FX.
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"You have to be in the right mindset for this movie. If you think you won‚Äôt like it, chances are you won‚Äôt. But if you keep an open mind you‚Äôll see the movie for what it really is. I thought it was pretty good and I‚Äôm looking forward to the other movies"
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"From reading the reviews I guess boomers don't want their memories of star wars be besmirched.  It was great.  Casting, acting, the sets, story was a great heros journey... the best space movie since the original Guardians of the Galaxy."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"This is a good-looking sci-fi movie of the typical ""Hero's Journey"" story genre. Are there parallels to Star Wars? Yes, because that is another ""Hero's Journey"" story written as a sci-fi space rebellion arc. I liked the characters and villians in this story, the acting was well done, the story is interesting and written well. I await the sequel(s) to see how it all ends...or continues."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Whilst a slow burn, I found myself on the edge of my seat. The world building & introduction of characters has created space for what is sure to be an epic saga. Whilst the storyline is something that has been told before that is the case with most sci-fi & fantasy novels, it's a hero's quest for redemption & for what is good in the world. The visuals were epic & the characters have depth that I look forward to diving into as they the journey continues.
Can't wait for part two!"
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,"Ignore the critics, this is a brilliant first part to a new space adventure. Looking forward to Part 2!"
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It was nice to see a new Sci Fi film, and I was really ready to enjoy it, but it was so completely unimaginative. There was so much room to develop characters more, but they didn't. The story was boring, so everything felt predictable. It took too much from other stories and just seemed lazy and cliche. My partner loved it though because he doesn't overanalyze."
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It keeps a fast pace of an action movie, but the story is uninteresting and the characters shallow.  The villain goes around with a a large bone in hand while commanding a ship that is ""worldender"". The physics and the anachronism of the movie are so bad that would wake you up in case you fell asleep between some slow-motion combats scenes."
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,I think this movie is severely underrated. I love a good futuristic sci-if and this movie checks all the boxes. The special effects don't look cheap like most movies with that much background animation. The action scenes are very well done and super entertaining to watch. The fantasy aspect is captivating and visually appealing.
"Jan 2, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Rebel moon-part 1: a child of Fire meh, I watched it. Alot of obvious, see me camera angles. Music ok, not great. The usual underdog , treachery, back-stabbing underhandedness. Supposed to be #1 in filums. Underwhelming.
6.5/0."
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,Absolutely awful. A bunch of random sci-fi and fantasy tropes smooshed together with some decent special effects. Story was ridiculous. Fight scenes make less than 0 sense. I would trust an 8th grader to come up with a better movie plot.
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,Amazing movie. Disney screwed up letting this one slip by.
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,Interesting movie and characters
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,Backstory: The Movie
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,Good sci-fi and have potential story
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,This film felt extremely generic as a big sci-fi fan I wanted to like it but it just came down to the same old tropes with un interesting characters.
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,This movie is pretty good.  I'm not sure what people want. There hasn't been a war based sci fi film that isn't a remake that got good reviews in forever.  Be thankful that this one is pretty good.
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Loved it. Something different for a change.
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Basically a remake of 'Battle beyond the Stars'. Some good visuals, baffling accent choices (yes of course the villain went to Eton!), clearly laying some storylines for future parts, but ultimately, nothing to justify the money spent.
No better than many straight to TV/Streaming films that cost a fraction of this budget.  Glad I didn't pay to see at the cinema, but entertaining enough to watch through."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It's classic space opera. The problem being that if already with the pilot , it accumulates lots of negatives : far too many unnecessary lengths & narrative exposition which weighs down the already not """"good"""" pace. As much as the 1st fight in the camp is nice & punchy. The 2nd (in the inn with the badguy wanting to fck one of the characters), but it's sooo slow... A sensation that will come back, ofteen üôÑüòñ"
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,Watched because of the great actors. Movie really sucked. Storyline was very weak just like the movie in general.
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"Loved the imagery, story, and characters. While familiar it was still unique in its undertone focused on empathy and kindness as n such a harsh world. Beautifully filmed and fight scenes choreographed."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Justice League vs the Space Nazis.
Poorly shot, weirdly lit, medley of every sci-fi trope available, set against a backdrop of cheap CG and peppered with wooden acting."
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie, fresh different yet everything you want in a sci Fi movie"
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,I watched the entire movie!
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"Forget about critic's reviews, the movie is great"
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"Love the start of a new story. The visuals of each planet has its own beauty. There are also shots in a scene that make you wonder if a hidden image or meaning exists in that shot. There are characters in this film that one can identify with. Some of these characters, you just love to hate. And there's still more back story and future story to tell with these characters. I understand that Part One has set up the team. I am so ready for part 2."
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Universe is cool would have liked to see more than just a pit stop at planets
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Thoroughly enjoyed it. Many artful scenes.
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I can't really describe how boring this movie felt. Everything seemed so generic. I felt no involved at all with the charatcers, that felt incredibly dumb at times. I mean, is it so hard to write something a little interesting? Slow motions and lens flares are not enough to make it a decent movie. I usually tend to finish watching even things i don't like, but i'm not going to watch part two."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I don't even know where to start with this one. The pacing was horrible, they had a crazy over-reliance on slow motion, they introduced a bunch of super interesting characters with little to no backstory or development, and the main character is, and I cannot stress this enough, literally Gamora, but instead of being adopted by Thanos, she was adopted by the empire from Star Wars. This movie was horrible."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I liked Rebel Moon, it was not perfect but it was a fun watch."
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Very entertaining.  A fun ride from start to finish
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,What is wrong with you guys. I can't even remember in the last 15 years when someone delivered an SCI-FI like Rebel Moon. This movie should be above 70%.
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,How did they ever get funding for this? An unending row of cliches. Unbearably bad.
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Give me back two and a half hours of my life!! My god!!! what ever expectetion you have for this movie, make it lower!."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not enough time given to develop each of the characters, and sooo full of fantasy stereotypes. This is a story that would probably be better as a 3-book trilogy and then another trope can be checked. Visually pretty."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"For once, the pro critics are right."
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,300 meets star wars love them both and love rebel moon.
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The lack of creativity is strong here, the cynical way of trying to get away with copying various science fiction masterpieces verbatim. So much visual garbage, unnecessary VFX abuse, and painful slow motion.
And Snyders said his cut is the best? Save time and avoid this mistake."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Dull, wooden script and acting and so much slo-mo you have time to take a nap during action scenes."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Well done, but nothing new. It's pretty formulaic...although I'm looking forward to the sequel."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Zack should let actual writers do the writing and not force them to insert his ideas into the narrative. EVER.
Rebel Moon is nothing but a collection of sci-fi/fantasy tropes, cliches, dressed up with tired and over-used designs swipes from video games, comics, and other better movies and tv shows.
Rebel Moon is absolute garbage!
YUK!"
"Jan 1, 2024",NEUTRAL,I am not a big scifi person but I actually enjoyed this and looking forward to next part of the series.
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,For first time it is huge thumbs up. Nice visual effects. I will watch again in few months. Definitely waiting for the sequel coming in April 2024!
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Maybe it's so bad, it's good? The dialogue is cheesy (and thereby hilarious) and overall it's stupid. I watched the whole thing."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"It was visually very nice but felt like a mash up of star wars, guardians of the galaxy and Dune. The winged creature was stright up from Hogwarts but in night mode. If some one hasn't seen any of the movies, they would find it cool. Story line is pretty formulaic so much so that you can predict whats gonna happen in the next movies."
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"I delayed watching this after reading the critic's review, so was surprised by how much I enjoyed Rebel Moon.  Yes, it's derivative, but so is almost every modern sci fi film I've ever watched, with the possible exception of Blade Runner and Inception.
The backstory narratives were important to set the scene for the series, the acting was good and pleasantly low-key, the dialogue was nicely minimalist, the cinematography was wonderful and the action was gripping.  
And the Magnificent Seven was an excellent remake, so using Seven Samurai as inspiration is a bonus.
We need to stop with the whining Star Wars fanboy reviews or we'll never see Part 2."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEUTRAL,It's like watching a bad superhero movie....meh
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This was nothing more than a rip off of the very first Star Wars movie. Rebels. Weird music and characters in a bar. Finding rouge pilot to fly you to look for more future  rebels. Fight off empire fleet while vastly out numbered. Acting that's not even that good. And to make it even worse, enough CGI to choke a horse. If you want to see this kind of movie, watch Star Wars. 100 times better."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It looks great, and if you're inclined, you can spend your time guessing which movie a scene has come from or see how many of the actors appeared in Game of Thrones. But to be honest it is over two hours long and that's only part one!! I don't think we're gonna make it."
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Great story A lot of fun to watch
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Awesome movie definitely can't wait for part two
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I'm glad I didn't pay money to see this in a theater. Even starting out with no expectations, it was still a disappointment."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"What did I just saw .. 
Such bad and lazy script writing"
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"I'm not sure why so low rating here, but I enjoyed a lot! Such a mix of Dune, StarWars and everything! I liked aesthetics"
"Jan 1, 2024",NEUTRAL,"300 meets Star Wars. The storyline is flat and the effects are really good, an enjoyable watch but nothing that will surprise you or make you think."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEUTRAL,"I was entertained. Yes, it's derivative (not nearly so much as John Wick 4), but I liked all the movies it stole from, so, yes, I was entertained and look forward to the second half."
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,very good start to the saga... waiting for the sequel which seems promising
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,If you like watching other people play video games then you might enjoy this. There is no acting required for this film. The dialogue is either voice over exposition or grunts and orders during fight scenes. This is an idea for a movie but not a realized vision.
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,The movie was not a masterpiece but entertaining and hopefully it will get better with part 2. The universe has potential. I like   the movie.
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,Poor Battle beyond the Stars rip off with a modern diverse cast
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"If you've seen enough of Zack Snyder's movies this is typically how they are. As long as you go into knowing his style you'll really enjoy the movie. Ignore the critics, the movie is a great watch"
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"First 5 minutes was a little worried, but quickly found myself drawn in. Fun universe he created very star wars meets cyberpunk. I'm excited to see the next part in April."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Visually stunning. It is a good idea, but the choppy story weakens the film and the (at times) patronizing dialog suffers. You'll get mad at the film's potential to be great, but in the end, you'll have enjoyed watching it."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,Awful character development/writing. Worst movie I've seen in a while.
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,Boring storyline.. a duplicate of familiar stories.
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"There are movies made as if the setting and the heroes inspire and invigorate the authors. This movie is opposite; i got a feeling, personally, that the authors were as much bored and disgusted with it as was I."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Superb special effects cannot help a story built on tropes of the Star Wars series. Rebellion by downtrodden characters against an evil intergalactic empire, a lovable robot, a weird assemblage of aliens in a space bar etc. There are certainly moments of a little tension but the outcome is never in doubt. Add to this that the inconsistencies are alarming - a society where people plough with horses, hunt elk and cook over fires, yet have automatic sliding doors and electric lights. Spend your time on something better."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Tries hard with plots and lines from
other various sci-fi movies but fails. Some good effects but not that engaging."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Its pretty. Its familiar. It's mildly entertaining and will fill in two hours. Don't come here looking for anything original though. 

Take the best, most cliched parts of all the sci-fi and classic western movies ever made and put them together into one sci-fi movie. Be sure to go extra heavy on the ""Star Wars"" franchise. Take inspiration and the best bits from everything from slang and clothing from gangster movies, mafia movies, action movies and even a smidgen of Harry Potter beasts and Voila! You've got it. Its Rebel Moon! 

Entertaining, pretty, but not an original bone in its body..."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Pour se comparer √† Star War il ne suffit pas d'essayer de copier, il faut cr√©er et l√† on est loin de l'innovation. Les personnages ne sont pas attachants, l'intrigue est pr√©visible, le m√©chant est un Dark Vador d√©guis√© en SS, les vaisseaux sont moches et fonctionnent encore au diesel...
Bref beaucoup de bruit pour rien...."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I want to like Sofia Boutella in something, but even slower-mo isn't going to do it,"
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"Vi ayer la pel√≠cula y no sab√≠a qu√© esperar de ella, pero realmente me sorprendi√≥.  Espectacular, entretenida y con unos efectos especiales muy bien logrados."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,Unnessesery long. Jumping to fast between sets. Bad characters. Over using of slow motion and the visuals are somethimes blurred and not sharp for any reason.
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,Awful accent - unwatchable. Please redub
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"I don‚Äôt get all these bad ratings, if you don‚Äôt like sci fi movies, don‚Äôt watch them just to give them a bad rating, This was a really entertaining movie, really well done. "
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"SW is bad enough these days. Do we really need more hacks attempting to duplicate their mindless drivel? Bad scifi, bad writing, bad acting, no originality."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,This movie gave me diarrhea
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"I cannot understand any of the hate towards this movie. Quality acting, quality graphics, quality production. Predictable - sure - but in no way hurts the amazingness and enjoyment of the experience. Watch it and enjoy and stop being such critics!"
"Jan 1, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Not as bad as critics make it out to be, i actually watched the whole thing."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Writing was god awful, not sure how much that affected the really bad acting but it certainly didn't help."
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"The visual effects were superb throughout with compelling characters and outstanding performances, especially Cara. The plot and setting reminds you of several universes but it never detracted from the viewing experience. I thought one scene at the Trading City bar was reminiscent of the Star Wars Cantina but that was the only blatant borrowing I saw. Obviously it is about a group of Rebels that rebel against an Empire, so you can see some of the parallels to Star Wars. I also felt it had some homage to Dune and Chronicles of Riddick. The movie plays quickly at 2:15 I never felt it dragged and let me just say there is a twist near the end that surprised me and something unexpected. I understand this is a multi-part series so hopefully it will develop a following. If you love Sci-fi, give it a chance and enjoy it for what it is and do not try to overanalyze it."
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"I would give it a 4 out of 5 for what it's worth. It was obviously a Star Wars rip off but it was a rip off I enjoyed while I hated the character development, pacing and length it was a movie I enjoyed and excited to see the future. One of the reasons why I am writing a positive review is because it is only the start of something and has great potential."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The writing/dialogue felt very juvenile and the multiple grandstanding slow motion sequences felt cringe and pointless.

I wasn't impressed."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,The plot is bugs life in space. They did get warriors instead of circus performers.
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"- RebelMoon pg13 c√≥mo pel√≠cula cumple todas las expectativas, es entretenida, tiene muy buena acci√≥n, buen VFX, hermosa cinematograf√≠a, y un excelente score, una problem√°tica bastante relacionable y con una historia facil de seguir. 
Esta versi√≥n abarca lo suficiente en cuanto historia y desarrollo para introducirnos a este universo y a estos personajes y justamente al mostrar solo lo suficiente para comprender la trama y personajes te hace querer conocer y ver mas d√°ndole a la audiencia el ideal de seguir enganchado y querer ver la parte dos de esta historia y el futuro corte del director para indagar en el pasado de los rebeldes y en el trasfondo de la historia a√∫n mejor; Rebel Moon va directo al punto, una din√°mica que se puede percibir tal vez apresurada pero para lo que intenta ser esta versi√≥n lo logra muy bien, una introducci√≥n √©pica pero sencilla al p√∫blico a un nuevo universo.

- RebelMoon as a pg13 movie meets all expectations, it is entertaining, it has very good action, good VFX, beautiful cinematography, and an excellent score, a very relatable issue with an easy to follow story.
This version covers enough history and development to introduce us to this universe and these characters and precisely by showing just enough to understand the plot and characters it makes you want to know and see more, giving the audience the ideal of staying hooked and wanting to see part two of this story and the future director's cut to delve into the rebels' past and the background of the story even better; Rebel Moon gets straight to the point, a dynamic that can perhaps be perceived as rushed but for what this version tries to be, it achieves it very well, an epic but simple introduction for the audience to a new universe."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,Poor character development and boring.
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen.  It's not original at all, it's directly a 1 for 1 rip of Battle Beyond the Stars for the first half.  Nothing in this movie is actually original.  It's as if the writer took his favorite clips of movies he's watched and fed them into an AI script generator and filmed what came out the other side.   Also 75% of the film is purposely blurry for artistic reasons, but only served to annoy me."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Not only did it steal ideas and styles from the likes of Star Wars, Star Trek, and Lord of the Rings, but it looks like they also stole their makeup and props.
Add that to the two characters with absolute awful impersonations of Northern Ireland accents, for whatever that was meant to add to the story.
It was a god awful movie.
Please writers and actors, go back on strike. Looking back, that was a much happier time for the viewer."
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Watch the Seven Samourai (1954) or The Magnificient Seven ( 1960) and you will get a better movie, actors and better script"
"Jan 1, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie is like a very bad composition of Star Wars, Star Trek, Ghost in the Shell, Warhammer 40k, and even some Mythology element (wtf). There is literally no build up of the charaters and no climax... I felt like I was watching a very low budget sci-fi movie, both the storyline and the directing are exeuted extremely poor. This is definitely one of the worst movies I have watched in 2023, if not the worst..."
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"This movie was so good, unbelievable! Graphics were great. A nice mix of medieval times and new technology. The story was beautiful and the fights were incredibly good! Can't wait for part 2 of the movie!!"
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Can't wait for the full length R rated version to see more!
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible, save yourself the embarrassment of having a part 2."
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,It just wasn't my cup of tea
"Dec 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It definitely gives off Star Wars vibes, however the story/plot is what I'd call decent, it at least keeps you watching. I am disappointed it's in Parts as I'd prefer more finalization. The ending is a bit unrealistic and frustrating. The CGI is a little ""meh"" during some scenes, but overall visually appealing. Some parts are predictable almost painfully so - but doesn't hurt the overall movie, the acting could use a little polishing, as some ""serious/dramatic"" scenes were almost comical and I'm sure that was not intended. I do plan on watching further Parts for finalization to the story as it does have my attention as I'd like to see where this story goes."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"L√°tv√°nyos, tetszet≈ës, j√≥k a karakterek, b√°r n√©hol kisz√°m√≠that√≥... √©s √©le se tagadhatn√° a 7 mesterl√∂v√©sz el≈ëtti tisztelg√©st. :)"
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,Visually great! Once the storyline evolves it's all downhill from there. I really feel that this was one of the 1st movie scripts written fully by AI. The writers fed it 5 other successful sci-fi movies and said turn all of these into 1 movie giving us Rebel Moon
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked it. I knew it would get bad reviews, before it came out. It held my attention and was a lot of fun and I can't wait for part two. So there!"
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,Seem like Copy paste from random movies. Magic sifi mixed with olden times wtf. It's like chatgpt created it.
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Nonsensical tripe. Zero sense of scale or appropriateness. Eg rustic cottages with sliding doors, but let's use a horse drawn plough  for agriculture."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is great. A great start to a new Universe. I can't wait to see more. Amazing visuals and great action.
"Dec 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Agree with other reviews - still enjoyed the movie and will watch second one but fails to establish an enduring IP - liberally takes from other SciFi IPs (StarWars , Foundation even Potter to name a few ) and does not invest enough in character development - General Titus, Tarlak , Nemesis and others all deserved more time in their background to make us care and get vested . 

Will be mostly enjoyed and forgotten fast"
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Derivative in details, but solid story core, even if based off of Seven Samurai. I think this would have been better as a series. More time for character development would have benefited the story. Very entertaining, just don't go into this movie thinking Star Wars. Be open minded."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought this movie was epic. The first fight scene, where she's protecting the girl, literally got my heart pounding. I don't understand why so many disliked this movie, because I thought it was amazing and I can't wait for part 2!"
"Dec 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The film major Inspirations include Star Wars and Game of Thrones. There are interesting characters and the visuals are excellent. However, the film is too predictable and could have a much stronger plot to be better. I did enjoy watching it, but it could have been better. Overall, I recommend it, especially for fans of the sci-fi genre."
"Dec 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was fine. And that is all. The cgi was decent, the acting was pretty good but the story was seriously lacking. I feel like a whole lot of nothing happened. I have a feeling when part 2 comes out we'll be saying they could have cut both films down to make one movie."
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Nice visuals. Terrible script. Terrible acting. Improbable scenarios - I don't mean the sci-fi elements (of course), more the human interactions which are weak and too easy, too obvious. It's the magnificent seven of the 21st century done very badly. I won't be watching Part II if it were to be released."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie has flaws but very enjoyable! It doesn't deserve all the negative reviews.
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The character development, plot, melodrama, all horrible. It's like if you asked AI to make a movie mashing up Star Wars Harry Potter the matrix lord of the rings and Vikings. There's no reason to care about the characters or their struggles, just instantly DRAMA, there's no humor, most of the characters aren't even likeable. The action and the plot are very contrived. You can tell what's going to happen before it does. Just more terrible sci-fi garbage.  WE WANT GOOD SCI-FI MOVIES AGAIN! This ain't it."
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,So stereotyped and hackneyed it looks like a parody until it becomes so violent it becomes torture porn. Truly an unpleasant experience . I cannot imagine how depraved the director's cut must be if this is the cleaned up version.
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A thick base of Star Wars, seasoned with a dose of LOTR, plus some elements of Dune, with a pinch of Gladiator, and a little Harry Potter, plus anything you want to add... That's the recipe"
"Dec 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Very predictable at times, but enjoyable. Like Game of Thrones meets Star Wars. Excited for part 2!"
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,Overall not great. Not like-able characters. Overall poorly casted. Way too much slow motion scenes which is a zach trademark. 
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't believe the HATE HYPE.
The movie has a unique fascinating aesthetic, an action oriented plot and an intriguing premise.
Comments that criticize a DISJOINTED and INCOHERENT plot are completely misplaced.
The story is more than EASY to follow and the character flashbacks are well introduced. Can not wait for part 2."
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's Star Wars meets Game of Thrones meets Harry Potter Meets The Avengers. 
Are there no new tales to tell? Bowing to a Hippogriff to tame it? Really? The graphics were nice but seriously the story line was predictable by almost everyone over the age of ten years."
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Felt like someone told chat gbt to make a western scifi movie with nazis and slow motion. Wast of time watching it, I've seen better stories in mystery science theater 3000."
"Dec 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,This is one of those movies that hits all the right cliches to make it a good waste of an hour and a half if you're up for it.
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,Nothing original. Plain predictilable storyline. Everthing look like everything done before.
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Un malgasto de tiempo y dinero en un producto que nisiquiera est√° completo, s√∫male las escenas recortadas que dan una sensaci√≥n muy fea y poco entendible."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked Rebel Moon, despite the critics reviews. It had great effects and CGI, a storyline to get behind and interesting characters. Enjoy it for what it is - an action packed, visually dynamic film. All in all very entertaining and looking forward to the next chapter."
"Dec 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was going for complex and ended up being too simple of a story. Visuals were perfect. It's like a Space 300.
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"it was not what i expect from this film, but it was cool"
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"It has been a long time since i watched an epic scifi that doesnt have any kind of source material. Rebel Moon Part 1 has amazing casts and premises. CGI is also very satisfying. Sound design and scores are great to hear. The only thing that I think Rebel Moon can improve is the action scenes since (I've been exposed to John Wick), most action scenes in movies just feels off. Will watch Part 2 and if there is a Director's Cut, absolutely will watch also!"
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Great visuals, but thats it. The Story is a mixture of a dozen other movies. Character development is not existing. If you are home alone, the weather outside is awful and you did like Star Wars/Comics/Dune go for it."
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Es super entretenida y se pasa volando a pesar de su duraci√≥n algo larga (sin dejar de lado la maravilla visual que posee), pero si, solo es una pel√≠cula palomera mas del mont√≥n. Historia y mundo poco original, personajes con una gran carencia de personalidad propia que cae en lo plano y superficial, los efectos dos que tres y el exceso de slow motion. Una franquicia que tendr√≠a un buen potencial si se consigue una herramienta mejor (escritor)."
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,Has the feeling of being written by someone who watched Star Wars once and stepped in to become a writer during the strike.
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So many tropes there's no room for characters to breathe. It's so inspired by others, that it could be a sequel/prequel to any movie. Big waste of everything, for everyone."
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,Over the top bad guys. Turned me off too much and stopped watching after about 30 mins.
"Dec 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Isit an Oscar worthy film worthy of 5 stars? No. 

But it is entertaining, visually amazing and its a completely new universe. No source material. 

Yes it borrows elements from other movies, but what movie doesn't these days?! 

AT WORST this film should be 5 stars imo. 

AVERAGE at the very least. 

Will watch the directors cut and part 2 for sure."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love it, an entertaining movie, with incredible photography and that is not more than what it promises, but not less either."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Superb.  Slow paced at times but that gives you time to appreciate the stunning visuals.  Battle sequences are remarkable.  Music score is perfect. Looking forward to seeing part 2 üòÉüëç
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"basically a starwars-like version of ""Seven Samurai"" (1954 / Kurosawa Akira) 
only with far more poor story 
and poor ""trying hard to be cool"" action scenes...

don`t waste your time on this one, go see Seven Samurai instead."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,This Movie Is A Masterpiece.
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bland, derivative, boring, honestly just painful to watch especially when it had a lot of potential visuals were honestly pretty good but the plot the writing the dialogue the characters just made me want to put a gun to my head or Atleast switch to a better movie like dune, Star Wars ect because at least it's then the source material and not just a lazy poorly executed knockoff"
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Of course when you watch the first part of a new movie with no advertising or book hype, it's hard to understand the plot. Like Maze Runner. But this movie is awesome. Graphics and plot are awesome. I love it. Can't wait for part II."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Reminds me a lot of Firefly.  The origin story made it is a little disconnected, but it has a lot of potential."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"It seems to be a mix of many sci-fi movies. It has you rooting for the protagonist.  Decent story,  good effects, entertaining."
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wanted it to be akin to Star Wars, but wasn't the case. Just another 500 knockoff with bad/annoying cinematography and a loose plot. Turned it off after 10mins. Wish I would've sooner."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. I was entertained. I loved the characters and the storyline was interesting.
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you like the magnificent seven, or you are a big fan of sci-fi and fantasy, this movie will feel like your happy place. Sure it pulls from a lot of previous work, but it is pure fun and visually awesome. Don't let the curmudgeon, skeptics dissuade you. Watch it!"
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No creativity, no story coherence.. just a bunch of clips from star wars, matrix, the 5th element, gladiator, brave heart, etc. And what's up with the overuse of slow motion along with dramatic music every  5 minutes... it became tedious to watch so I ended up muting the movie and scrolling my phone."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Action (Slo mo wasn't bad, stop nit picking), Good story was like Dune but the idea was pitched to Star Wars before the most recent movie of Dune came out, Great characters excited for part 2."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Great move loved the story and the VFX
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,This was a very big disapointment WOW.  The only thing I will give credit to this movie was Anthony Hopkins voice being used and some of the visuals were quite good.  This was awful.
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Exceptional cast, build up, and story line."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertained me so it's fine
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is funny and have scenes joinfuly, it doesn't change your Life but It's easy to see until ends."
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was so excited about this movie, but it was so stupid and boring. a few fight scenes were amazing, the lead actress is amazing, but the rest of this film is trying too hard to be an alternative scifi/star wars esque type film. There was just too much from '300' as far as style and film tricks, and the rest was just plain stupid. I'm so sorry to say all of this, just over it already. Ugh."
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, character development sucks, characters in general suck. But it's semi entertaining."
"Dec 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not bad but not great either, kinda like a Star Wars sequel with less familiar characters and elements of Dune and Foundation"
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Really liked the movie so many movies the critics get wrong like this one.
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"To say it is a masterpiece is an understatement. The only thing that can be criticized is the length, since it could easily last at least an hour more to better develop the plot, but despite of that, the movie delivers. Can't wait to see the part two."
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very boring, far too long, and the usage of slow mo was so completely pointless. It was like someone just hit the slowmo button at random times and far too often, as if my 4 year old was manning the button. The characters and acting were boring, weak, and just plain bad. The plot was so simple and the costumes also made absolutely no sense. Nothing about the movie was coherent."
"Dec 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Only gets 3 stars for me due to production and visuals. 

Movies started with potential for me but plot couldn't carry it through to the end."
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining movie can't wait for part two.
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If this wasn't written by AI (I'm not convinced it wasn't), we can use it as a reminder of how derivative things already became before AI took over."
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Un collage mal pegado de pel√≠culas, nada recomendable"
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Actually like this, I‚Äôm just annoyed that we have to wait for part two"
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Yes it pulls from an array of sci-fi and fantasy themes. However, it‚Äôs very well paced and quite entertaining. If you are a fan of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, you will definitely enjoy this movie. "
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,Isn't this just Battle Beyond the Stars - seemed very derivative.
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,Prob the worst movie I've seen this year
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"es una pelicula muy predecible y muy clich√© , al directo parece que le gusta la berenjena"
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the most uncreative movies I've seen. The visuals are amazing but the story is basic. This feels like a bad mix up of dune and Star Wars. I'm kinda done with space nazis too.
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The film is interesting, but the script is weak and meaningless"
"Dec 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining, people are jumping on the bandwagon of recent film flops, this one is not one of those. It is a very stylistic & visually compelling film, while it plays on tropes much like any genre, it sets up for a story and sci fi world that has been missing in recent film. Ignore the bad reviews, sick film!"
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Substance lacking, derivative sci-fi that invokes no feelings in the viewer towards the characters or plot. Unfortunately isn't made up for in action, with slow style fight scenes making it an unengaging and dull watch."
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Really bad. Not just bad, but REALLY BAD! Weak storyline, bad acting, accents that keep changing (Irish one moment, Northern Irish the next), plot non existent. No idea why there was so many slow-mo's‚Ä¶. It was like I was back in the 1980s‚Ä¶ or maybe it was an attempt to divert attention from just how shite this really was."
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,Writing was pretty poor. The acting was not very good. Lots of inconsistencies and jumps. If this is supposed to be a brand new movie and not just the Star wars rip off than it needs to fill in the gaps and explain the motivation of the characters. A lot of the characters just were given one or two sentences and suddenly just jumped in and started helping the protagonist. A lot of the acting was just grossing chewing and just not a very entertaining movie.
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely not a single original line, trope nor character. Takes itself way too seriously without delivering any kind of actual plot, storyline or arc that anyone over the age of 11 would care. Can be visually stimulating at times, but pushes epicness so much that it becomes annoying. There's only so much slow-motion, smoke, lens flares and epic chorus you can take in a movie."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ist nicht der beste Film der Welt,
aber deutlich besser als die neuen Disney Filme.
Die Zeitlupe war ziemlich nervig und die Plotholes waren schon mie√ü."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Naaah! You would think that with all the present technology and AI it should be amazing, but it's just ridiculous to watch"
"Dec 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Rebel Moon, an space Opera that is mostly based on previous SciFi movies but...
Photography is excellent, scenarios are net and believable, the characters still are not developed only introduced, the rhythm is fast and enjoyable but probably is missing at least one hour of deeper content (sure will be delivered on part TWO), it's only the PART ONE of TWO (careful with that), the characters and encounters are fun.

So for now we can see only half of what's to come, for me was fun, entertaining and solid basement for the climax on Part II. 

The references for this film are Star Wars, Warhammer 40k and 7 Samurai."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning , good special effects and cast. A lot more gritty and bloody than star wars I enjoyed it and recommend it to all."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It started out well enough, but fell apart as it went. Very jumbled middle act, and poorly done final act. Not great, but somewhat entertaining in parts."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie!! Haters gonna hate
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A truly awful waste of a sci-fi film. It is so rare to have an original big budget sci-fi in a scene dominated by Star Wars, superheroes, and adaptations. Unfortunately this is anything but original. It's A New Hope meets Seven Samurai whilst trying to be Dune, but it fails on all fronts. Every single line of dialogue is exposition or a cliche inspirational diatribe. Just a really dumb and boring film."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Same old story, been done over and over to the point you'd think they would know how to make interesting characters and there are writers and directors out there that can make a good story and interesting characters. They just weren't involved in this movie. One word to describe  - LAME."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was something different, I gave it a chance and I loved it! Way to go Zack ! Brilliantly casted & story line was a bit rushed but I know the real cut would have filled missing pieces. Great movie!"
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is great! Plenty of drama, tension and action in a well realised universe."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movie! Must watch.
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,This film proves that critics don't matter. Period.
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie is basically a mesh of ""Marvel"" movie stereotypes mixed with references to other franchises, mainly wh40k (in a bad way) and star wars.
Was expecting something less ""sexualised"", I don't mind some sexual undertones but here they where just awkward.
It was trying to be deep and funny at the same time without managing to do one.
And get ready for Slow motion shots every 5 minutes.
Tldr:
Stereotype mess, bad storytelling and shitty Slow motion."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A WOEFULLY DERITIVE CLICHE!

I don't know how seven other directors haven't sued over the blatant plagiarism of Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor, to name a few; it's not even subtle! That might be just about be excusable if they could disguise it inside a half decent story line, but this is just one pantomime cliche followed by another in a sequence that could be predicted by a 5 year old! A real shame given the extent of the casts potential talent... They must have known how basic this was... Smells rife of cash before quality!!

JJ"
"Dec 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Its a great movie with clear flaws. The main cast arent very interesting, too many slow-mo scenes, and some bad CGI. But I respect Zack Snyders vision for this movie, and I did enjoy it. It's clearly influenced by Star Wars, but still does it own thing. People expected star wars, and did not receive it - which is good in my opinion. Looking forward to part 2."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Beautiful fx and nice visuals, but the story and characters needed major development. It had a lot of potential but fell short of Snyders much older movies.
Story and plot is everything, nice cgi and fx can only take you so far."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand all the negativity about this movie? I watched it with an open mind other than hoping for a ‚ÄòStar Wars' experience, the original trilogy not the other money making dross that came after, and was pleasantly surprised.
Rebel Moon is much needed in the recent times of Marvel domination in that it's a film that does what it should, entertain! 
And on a plus point it sets up that feeling of anticipation for the next part of what has been billed as a trilogy‚Ä¶ and until then, a Syndercut!"
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Why must all of these critics and keyboard warriors expect that media is going to change their lives??? Seriously it's a move and a good one. it doesn't have to convey some kind of life epiphany. ""Are you not entertained?"" These are the same people that hated empire strikes back, aliens, T2, and matrix (before they loved them)!"
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great visuals, story falls flat. But still an entertaining movie!"
"Dec 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I wanted to like it. But its just a copy of other Sci fi films. You having a feeling of Deja Vu as your watching it. Also slow motion is fine in small doses, but this film is loaded with em."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A half arsed copy of star wars and a few other franchises. I was constantly distracted by how bad this movie was written. The narrative was so lazy, every twist is predictable. You'll feel used at the ending."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"From the very first scene I knew the movie had all the right elements. Action, great characters, stupendous fight scenes and a worthy heroine. Then the gloss wore off. Each of the fascinating new 'Seven Samurai' characters were tossed in without explanation or background. We were expected to mentally pick them up and ride with it. This movie that should have been at least split into two and given more effort given to character development. Sadly disappointed."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Shitty Star Wars copy where no one is interesting at all.
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Very good movie kept me interested from start to finish
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Was a rehash of better science fiction films, only more boring"
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,A waste of time and money.
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie would be 30 minutes long if it weren't for all the slo-mo
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,A story as obvious as it is pleasant to view.
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's like watching a parody movie without the laughs. Epic Sci-FI effects fail to resurrect a slow dying pile of sheep poo.
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is good and i really love it. Looking forward for part 2.
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's sad to see someone at the end of their career this desperate
"Dec 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Was entertaining and the characters weren't too bad, but for the ending. I like the play on the Bolshevik revolution and evils of communism. However the climax falls into the cliche and lazy writing of getting backstabbed by the guy we all saw a mile away, but the heros easily turn the table and use the situation to their advance to put a nice closing for them."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,We need a 20+ movie universe outa this
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Everything in this movie was obvious and flat. The art direction was flat, (bland ships, weapons, locations); the CGI was flat, obvious and distracting, the story was flat and built entirely off cliches (shirtless American Indian who easily communicates with animals, Asian sword matter, cartoonish villains that are full of bloodlust and quest for power, et al.), the acting was flat (but they didn't have much to work with); the excessive slow-mo scenes felt old and recycled. I guess they best thing about it was the action choreography, but that isn't enough to sustain a movie for me.

In the end, I felt no emotions at all in this entirely forgettable movie.

In the new sci-fi space, The Creator was MUCH better in all aspects (story, characters, world-building, art direction, cinematography, writing, et al.)"
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Definitely the worst movie I have watched in the past decade. Not sure how this even gets greenlit .
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Half way through and I lost all interest. At the point that a particular US (wannabe biker) actor appears with a truly terrible Irish accent playing a character so obviously based on Han Solo I understood why this film has so frequently been described as derivative. Especially as the prior scene is so obviously reminiscent of the bar scene also from the Star Wars films. Maybe it gets better but I can't be bothered.
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Looks to be the beginning of a pretty cool and entertaining franchise.  Action sequences are downright awesome!
"Dec 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's fun,it Looks amazing, it's long,"
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Recomiendo esta pel√≠cula de acci√≥n no te la pierdas nueva gr√°ficos
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A mashup of other, better, movies. Writing was weak as was the acting. This story has been told much better before."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The first half hour is promising, but then it's clear this is just a poorly-written sci-fi 7 Samurai. The scenes where you're introduced to a new samurai are painfully cliche - almost like they were jacked from another movie (like Avatar). I can't remember the last time I literally thought ""why the fk should I care this is happening?"" 

Impossible to suspend disbelief and enjoy this movie if your brain isn't damaged or you're like... 12. Hot, expensive, over-hyped garbage."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I wouldn't even call it a full-fledged movie, it's more like a collection of gathered and cut stories that resemble teasers for different parts of the same game, where you have to assemble a team of companions to fight the main boss. None of the characters evoke any emotions, neither good nor bad, and the action is set up very boringly. It's a dumb, dull, graphically poor, stylistically unrefined movie. Deeply disappointed."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Premature joke of a movie with below mediocre CGI. Zero character development, tropes galore, unrealistic converstions and around 14 year-old mental state for every character. It is deliberately chosen probably for the target audience. Above 16 years of age this movie not recommended to watch, cause it is cringe and trope-fest all the way. World design is bad and incoherent, zero environment details, zero environmental story telling. Bad CGI is all you get. The supermodel heroine pulling the plow is the icing on the cake, more lame cannot be! Waste of money, waste of time!"
"Dec 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I know, weak story and some copied characters from other movies, but the visuals are really beautiful."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,The story is superficial and predictable and the acting is quite poor. I was expecting at least some engaging action and cgi bit this also falls short and feels gratuitous
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Visually impressive yet the story fails to deliver a heavy enough spark. Think a bugs life only live action and in space with heavy star wars influences.
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm going to classify it as the best movie of the year. It is impressive and impeccable, every detail, shot and setting actually met my expectations."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,I love pretty much all of his movies but this weird failed star wars movie is absolute trash. Look forward to his next project (not Rebel Moon..)
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A purely visual spectacle, and not even a great one at that, hidden behind a muddy filter. Every scene is farcically derivative of Star Wars, Battle Beyond the Stars, Warhammer 40K, Turok, and many other, better sources. Boutella just isn't leading lady material, characters are zero dimensional points, it's gratingly expositional, and the action scenes are comically ineptly choreographed, burdened with jump-cuts and slow-slow-slower-motions. It feels like an episodic TV show, crammed into a badly edited 2 1/4 hours that feels much longer, and ends with a jarringly pointless ""To be continued"".  But... why, film, why?  Why continue?"
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was a good movie , I really enjoyed it ...."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,If you like action and fantasy you will like this. 
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Great Movie! Great Director - Eager to see the 2nd part.
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visually pretty, terrible story telling."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I dislike that movie. who greenlit it? the story, the pacing and the acting is horrible. the lead actress can't act and the others have basically no lines. it shouldn't be hard to deliver a 2h14 good movie from a veteran filmmaker without having to wait for the R-rated version with s*, blood and probably more interaction between the lifeless characters. I hope it stops here."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie had everything I love about sci-fi including some fun new concepts and presentations. The cast did a great job and had some of my favourite action stars. What I wasn't expecting, was everyone to be so dang easy on the eyes! Miss Boutella did a phenomenal job, as usual, and the action sequences did NOT disappoint. I can't wait for the next one! üèÜ"
"Dec 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I love a sci-fi, but as I watched it I realised it's ""the magnificent seven"" more or less, but it was okay"
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,nothing is a boring as CGI without a compelling story or interesting characters.
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Was it terrible.. no. It was just ok- enough to want to see the next scene they stole from a different sci-fi movie. Think this would be a great drinking/trivia movie for sure.
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Predictable, boring, uncharismatic characters.
Ungrateful true: People give too much hype for a director who is just ""ok"". Deal with it."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,The best scenarios Getty God ‚ô°
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,How anyone finishes the movie is a mystery to me. The acting is atrocious. The story is boring and predictable. I think they filmed a scene and wrote a story around it. It was so slow I the action scenes weren't enjoyable.
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Honestly, and I don¬¥t want to be a hatter, it was the worst movie of 2023 that I watched (and I watch almost a movie every day. Everyone had high expectations for the movie, some said it could even surpass star wars original movies. Overal Horrible story, bad performers, abusive SGI..but the worst was the disconnection between everything. Trying to mix several stories into one with zero originallity and abusive slow motion scenes."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,A story so tired‚Ä¶..characters so two-dimensional‚Ä¶‚Ä¶how does a budget this big get wasted on tripe like this‚Ä¶..?
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,succinct review - epic cringe
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"All the money, but storylines and attention to detail was way off. Some very very good scenes but as a movies goes no good."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Good not the best. it's what it is
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Honestly one of the worst movies i ever watched.

Visually you can see the millions that went into it, but everything still looks incredibly cheap and badly made, there is motion blurr everywhere and Slo-Mo in every single fight. The characters and story progression dont make sense at all.

It feels like it was written by AI to include all major tropes, big budget effects and character archetypes and just randomly string them together without reason or cohesion. No sequel can fix this mess of a story.

Snyder is a bad cinematographer but an even worse director."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was good, looking forward to part 2"
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Baddies are coming, get some goodies, destroy the baddies by pulling a lever. 
Nothing new, nothing exciting, looked like a perfume ad, imagine creating a universe as dull as this."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,so much slow motion letting you see how boring the film is in detail and so many accents???
"Dec 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Sci Fi fantasy nerds, this is your mixtape. I loved it and my brain checked out trying to count the bits and bobs from my most favorite in this genre. It was fun!"
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not an original idea in it.... Oh this is the Seven Samurai... this part is stolen from Star Wars... on and on like that...
"Dec 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Zack Snyder's ""Rebel Moon,"" catapults audiences into an expansive galactic odyssey that blends dazzling visuals with an intriguing narrative. As a fan of Snyder's distinctive style, I eagerly delved into this space epic. Snyder's signature visual flair is evident in every frame, elevating the movie to a cinematic spectacle. A Child of Fire serves as the inaugural installment in a series of adventures. One notable aspect is its ambitious attempt to construct a comprehensive universe; however, its drawback lies in the challenge of functioning seamlessly as a standalone movie. The film's emphasis on universe-building, while commendable, may hinder its effectiveness as an independent cinematic experience."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Love it!
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was painful to watch. A Frankensteinesque patchwork of d√©j√†-vu scenes from Harry Potter, the Witcher, LotR, hunger games, dune (and many, many more) sewn together with blurry seams a a heavy coating of SnyderSloMo. 
Basically no original thought. Would not be surprised if it was later revealed that ChatGPT was behind it from the start."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Unoriginal and forced.
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Really really bad, the story line was very basic and uninteresting. The only entertainment from this movie was the visual effects and the ""eye candy"" actors‚Ä¶.aside from that there is absolutely no substance to the story, very disappointing."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"El esqueleto de ""star wars"", vestido con muchas otras pel√≠culas de tono m√°s crudo y violento que ""star wars"" (por cierto Kora mucho mejor escrita que Rey), la est√©tica como una de las historias de ""Heavy Metal Magazine"" en live action, ¬°una belleza! esperando ver la versi√≥n extendida"
"Dec 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"S√≥ t√¥ dando nota 3 pq tem uns efeitos visuais legais q nem s√£o tudo isso mas salvam um pouco o filme!
Mano e tanta c√¢mera lenta q acho q se fosse normal o filme duraria 1 hr!
Atua√ß√µes fraquinhas, protagonistas carisma zero, motiva√ß√£o inexistente pra amea√ßar destruir um vilarejo de camponeses, cenas de luta super chatas e mau coreografadas, visual estranho e sem sentido q as vezes parece ser at√© aleat√≥rio, tem um Conan, uma samurai q por sinal e p√©ssima fazendo as coreografias de samurai kkk, um general sem ex√©rcito, e sem habilidades, uma protagonista muito nada ver com uma historia generica, uma escolha de vil√£o mal feita pq o ator s√≥ √© bom lutando, atuando e p√©ssimo, e pior q nem o ponto forte do cara foi explorado!
 parece uma mistura de game of thrones, com viking, lua de J√∫piter, nossa n√£o consigo nem descrever de t√£o aleat√≥rio q e o figurino, cen√°rio,e hist√≥ria!"
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Simply bad story, full of characters you don't care for. Sequence of scenes that supposedly had to help build the world and characters, but fails to drag the viewer in. Watching it, I only wanted it to finish, and entertained myself with thoughts in how many different ways same story could be told in much much better ways."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Can't even give movies good ratings for effects anymore.  Good effects are so common now.  This story set new levels of clich√© it is so unoriginal and forced that it is actually painful to watch.
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Simply, it just sucked. Slow and forgettable."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie!!! Don't know why it got so much hate. That much slo mo and I'm all for it. I don't know why people see that as a problem. I feel like the people who do not like this movie are just nit picking. It's hard to please the nerds
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Formulaic and predictable. Made it about 75% of the way through before giving up, having seen this before in about 100 other uninspired movies. Pretty though."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very engaging and visually appealing. Rapid sequence and enmeshed interplay of characters. Hopefully, we will get more emotional depth as the series expands, but most definitely worth watching."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,I found it was enough to keep me interested.  Almost a mishmash of a bunch of sci fi stories that isn't bad but isn't great either.  Again enough to keep me entertained by a non existent plot.
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Rebel Moon is what you would get if you ordered Star Wars from ""Wish"""
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Putting lipstick on a pig doesn't make it any thing else. Same old overpowered female trope. I'm rooting for this insurgency to be crushed.
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Nothing ground breaking here, but all in all, good cinematic, good AI effects, OK (though predictable plot), and something fun/great to watch.  For what it is trying to be, it's 5*."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Harry Potter from 2001 had better CGI than this
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was butt, not worth the bandwidth to stream it."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The characters are shoehorned into the story. The plot is railroaded and completely rebooted from Star Wars, nearly scene by scene. But hey, the parts that aren't unnecessarily blurry are really pretty."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the movie! The storyline was cool, and it had lots of cool graphics."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great visuals and character development (for pt. 1), overall history & world building seemed interesting, space fascist are always a great enemy. I did unfortunately dislike the climax as it seemed very rushed, predictable, and honestly just dumb IMO"
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Much better than I expected. It was fantastic.
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very cool movie. Pretty good original story with awesome special effects. Despite the critic reviews, which I don't trust these days I think this movie is going to catch on. The so called professional critics definitely got this one wrong. This movie is going to be huge and finally for once we don't have to wait years for the next part to premiere. "
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,The worst storyline I have seen in years. Written by a 13 year old or an AI?
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is not a good movie. I wanted to be entertained but nothing here is entertaining. Nothing at all original. Uninspiring, boring, so much slo mo. Even the big dramatic scenes were laughable.  I just wanted this movie to end.  It's battlefield earth all over again"
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,It just looked great and had cool characters. 1 of Zacks best work. Cant wait for Pt2.
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a great movie. Great story, awesome fx, amazing cinematography. The pace was a little fast but I think it worked in the movie's favor. It keeps your interest with the plot and plot twists. Can't wait for part 2."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I don't care who made it, it's drivel. Way too many good actors can't save this nonsense. Rips off Magnificent Seven's story, and does nothing with it. All in Slow-motion."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Enough with the girl power nonsense. 120 pound cutie single handedly takes out like 20 Jocko looking dudes. And that's just in the first 30 minutes. And the rest of the movie is equally stupid.
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall it is a great movie, had my attention, it was not clich√©, but you need to pay attention to details to really see how the story connects itseft, otherwise why would the Motherboard's Admiral go to such small farmer village? :) .....I hope they improve few things for part 2, like to better developer the characters."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was hoping for better, nothing ground breaking but also not horrible.  The movie was shot beautifully but the lead who played Kora felt wooden with her acting and the side characters weren't provided enough screen time to flesh out there characters.  Explaining their backstory is different than getting a feel for the characters through their interactions with each other."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Couldn't even finish it. It felt like someone told AI to create a movie from Star Wars, Game of Thrones, Foundation, and maybe MacGruber (""I'm putting together a team"") and this is what it spewed out. Admittedly I have found most of Zack Snyder's work bad to very bad, so maybe I'm just a hater."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is such a dumb movie.  It started off dumb and just kept getting dumber.  A world with spaceships that can destroy civilization and bend space don't need bushels of grain from psuedo futuristic farmers that use horses to till, and a fireplace to warm their homes yet have a metal electronic sliding doors that I assume use electricity.  Of course how can I forget the weird kings army that has uniforms that are a cross between a nazi army, ancient Persian military looking alien advisors and halo dressed warriors.    Fancy special effects can't make up for this terrible movie.    Dumb dumb dumb."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,Battle Beyond the Stars / Magnificent Seven with better production Values and a higher Budget. Denzel did it better.
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,It felt like 10 scenes were given to 10 different writers and none were allowed to speak to each other.  This film is an incoherent rambling mess.
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Nothing terribly compelling about it.   It's long and slow and not terribly original.  There are too many scenes that are so evocative of Star Wars that you wonder how much they just copied from them.  I don't have any real excitement to see Part 2 when it comes out.  But if it gets good reviews I would.
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was a Star Wars movie?...l had no idea, also there was better CGI 20 years ago"
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I knew it was going south as soon as the cliche of a horse drawn plow and farming village collided with them using electric lights.

Stir in a few imperial soldiers with zero discipline and a physics defying waterfall from a hill  you have probably the worst opening of any movie ever.

Just unspeakably bad."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is different,  and liked the action sequences. Some of the art was really good. I can't wait to see the 2nd one."
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,Quite the train wreck of sci-fi tropes and blatantly ripped off material and no meaningful story.
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Al ver la pel√≠cula me dio la sensaci√≥n de que era inicialmente una serie a la que le recortaron escenas y juntaron las que pudieron en una pel√≠cula, adem√°s de notar cierta falta de coherencia en los personajes, se demoraron casi toda la pel√≠cula reuniendo un equipo,  luchadores solitarios que fueron reclutados para defender un pueblo, me record√≥ a los ""7 magn√≠ficos"", solo que en esa pel√≠cula demoraron menos tiempo y aceptaron participar a cambio de un beneficio monetario, o al menos la mayor√≠a, en esta aceptan por unos bultos de grano, dejando como el √∫nico que podr√≠a aceptar sea al general, sin mencionar el contaste recuerdo que es una pel√≠cula inclusiva con todos los caracteres de la palabra, y se podr√≠a decir mas pero solo se√±alare el error de dialogo o de escenograf√≠a pero de que es un error es un error, es que al inicio se menciono que la cosecha crecer√≠a en 9 semanas y al menos desde lo que se muestra en la pel√≠cula apenas han pasado 3 o 4 d√≠as y al final de la pel√≠cula los tallos ya les llegan a las rodillas de los caballos. 
La verdad es de las peores pel√≠culas que he visto."
"Dec 30, 2023",POSITIVE,"Derivative and largely unoriginal yes; but better acting, sets, story and acting than most of the Star Wars Films. It's worth a watch."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning.  Being a long time Sci-fi fan, this has elements from all the classics.  It also has a Destiny feel to it, IMHO."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"There's a lot of logic gaps.  Why would a dreadnought ship want to buy 10 bushels of something from a farm in the middle of nowhere?  There's almost zero humour, why not tell a few jokes?  
People shouting and running when blasters are being fired is silly, they're not running faster than the plasma bullets.  They probably need a lightsaber type person to deflect bullets to make it interesting because it doesn't matter how strong someone is they can be easily shot and killed.
The imagery is impressive and it's emotionally moving in parts (rebel commanders death), just the tone is almost continuously orchestral.  It's hard not to be impressed but it does let itself down.

Finally, why are the evil guys all talking with Irish accents?"
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Nothing new or original and the slow motion in every action sequence gets old very fast.
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is what the Star Wars sequels should have been like, great action and great special effects ,and also great acting.i am looking forward to part two"
"Dec 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Found the last action predictable but the story is original (more or less), great acting and cinematography.  It's the beginning of a great story!  Worth a watch!!"
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Well what can I say this is my first review this is how much I want the two hours of my life back .this film is a star wars rip off I mean they had to go to a dump of a bar to find a pilot I think .I think was was drooling at this point.the characters have nothing going for them you don't learn anything about them it's the story has been told about a million times and it's not worth your money jump over just what Star wars the first one and each something 100% better even c3po legged out of this film only to turn up at the end and the slow motion I honestly thought I was going to see my first ever slow mo toilet seen .it's bad the CGI is good in places.how can nothing happen for 2 hours the pilot is wait what am I saying I didn't dectet a plot just a load of shirtless olid up studmuffins just sat there waiting to win there fight I can't think of anything to compare it to just a star wars rip off .dose Hollywood just throw money at anyone now days if so I am on it with my script called the shin strap redemption.peace out
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"really bland and forgettable. The characters were so underdeveloped, and it was so derivative in the story department. Would not recommend at all"
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What a mess. Visuals were unnecessarily blurry (a side-effect of the lens used during filming unfortunately), poorly color-corrected, and a fair amount of the effects looked unfinished. 

Neither the plot nor character arcs go anywhere meaningful, even if this is a ""Part One of Two"" situation. Charlie Hunnam's performance in particular is one of the worst I've seen in some time, and Sofia Boutella's can be described as nothing more than ""quiet farmer wearing a cape."" 

People say there is a longer, R-rated cut of this coming, and I'll be completely honest here: if the first cut of your film is this bad, you've killed any interest I had in a director's cut."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Thought the movie was well done, kept me entertained throughout. The pacing seemed just right to me. I liked the way they introduced characters. All in all I thought it was great and I'll be looking forward to part 2."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Formulaic, Star Wars wannabe.  No new ground broken here.  The characters are stiff and one-dimensional, if that, and completely uninvolving. It feels like it should have been based on a book, which might have given it some ""excuse"" to say that it hewed too closely or strayed too far away from the original, but apparently that's not the case.  There's no one else to blame!  If it were free and running in the background while you were on a treadmill, that's about the right level of investment.  Definitely no need or desire to see a Part 2."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Boring and so forgettable. Very disappointing.
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Where to start with this waste of 2 hours....

Look I will just answer the parts you all care about. The action scenes even suck. Now that thats out of the way and you know you can skip it.

The dialogue seems to have come from a middle school level drama. The character development is really quick and in your face at first, then suddenly just disappears its absolutely jarring. The pace is atrocious. And the amount of holes in the movies plot and development could fit the milky way. Im really not sure what to think. I know Im not going to be looking for episode 2 as this shamble of a show illustrated that maybe Zack should stick to directing others writing as his is pretty much bottom of the barrel."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie isn't that bad, but it is very choppy and doesn't flow very well. The visuals are really pretty good. The biggest problem that this film has, is Sofia Boutella is completely unlikeable. The hero needs to be somewhat likeable and heroic. Sofia Boutella is neither of those. She makes you want to cheer for the bad guy."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie has a bit of everything from Bugs Life to Star Wars to Game of Thrones.  Excellent sci-fi.
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie took a little bit to introduce the characters and storyline lol that's normal of a new movie that is trying to create a bug world. This movie was awesome and the future movies I hope are just as good.
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Where to begin‚Ä¶ tropish, cliche, pretentious, and boring. It's a rip off of every other sci fi / western plot. The bar scene was pulled right from Star Wars."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entertaining. No it‚Äôs not superbly original or groundbreaking but it is visually interesting, sports characters that you can root for and paves the way for a universe of heroes and villains. Fun. "
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Esta pel√≠cula es de las mejores de zack, tienen una excelente historia . Me encant√≥
."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What an absolute mess of a movie. A dogs breakfast of dialogue, disconnected scenes, boring snooze-inducing back story, clueless over the top all mad-man bad guys (groan), and more bad accents all at once than some crazy overdubbed 1990s anime. Just - yikes! Not sure which I care less about, the good guys (weak), the bad guys (dumb), or the ""I watched the seven samurai in college thirty years ago"" wafer thin plot. 100% forgettable."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly what more do you need, epic sci fi, more please"
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bad sc√©nario, too slow, slow-motion scenes totally boring... I stopped after 37 min. I like sci-fi but this film was worse than cheaper series from Canada üòÖ"
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Un Ni√±o de Fuego"" es una pel√≠cula que se adentra en la vida de un ni√±o con habilidades extraordinarias relacionadas con el fuego. A medida que descubre y aprende a controlar sus dones, la trama se desarrolla con elementos de fantas√≠a y aventura. La pel√≠cula ofrece una mezcla de emociones, explorando la singularidad del protagonista y su viaje para comprender y utilizar sus habilidades de manera responsable."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Literally the best Sci-Fi movie in the universe.
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It looks fantastic, but the writing and pacing is lazy. You want it to be good, and it could have been so good, but the melodrama and regurgitation of every other sci-fi and action trope makes for a confusing hodge-podge. You feel like you're meant to care, but you can't think why."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This could have been so much more. As it was the plot was without imagination and lacked creativity. Acting was over the top with a lot of screaming while shooting kind of thing. Visually it was nice. Overall, as a sci-fi fan, it was good, better than a lot of sci-fi out there, but it could have been so much more and so much longer and more detailed. Its like Zak tried to crush 6 hours of a story into a 2 hr. movie."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Words fail me! Lifeless, empty, just boring."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"I can see why the ""top critics"" panned this film, I nearly gave up after the first few minutes as it looked like it would be a weak, low budget, boring affair. BUT how wrong I was! Once the characters are introduced and developed over the first part of the film, the pace slowly ramps up and up and I got carried along on what is an exciting ride with great characters (as good as those in the super hero movies- and you could almost see this film in manga form with its style and action sequences. I'm glad I stayed the distance- and can't wait for part 2 already!!! Don't believe the downbeat critic reviews, which whilst understandable from the first few minutes, I think are disappointed it's a fairly simple premise. Like Star Wars was lol- a fabulous film but at its core good vs bad, albeit done with incredible mastery by all concerned. Give Rebel Moon a chance, I don't think you'll be disappointed, and maybe you'll love it as much as I do. Bring it on‚Ä¶"
"Dec 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,Visually stunning. Overall thought it was entertaining.
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Rating says, meh it passed the time, but it felt like I wasted my time. Nice visuals and makeup. The plot and pacing though were ridiculous - more like watching various cutscenes from an ""epic"" video game and with similar plot jumps - go here, collect character, build party, have fight / pass trial (and absolutely no context - the spider thing?!?!), continue on. Almost zero character development beyond the main character. 

[SPOILER]
Got to the ""last"" big scene / fight of the movie and I thought, wait, this isn't the end of the movie already?!? They basically got tricked to land at the equivalent of a warehouse loading bay and...oh the big bad is here, uh, tension, capture, escape, fight, explosions, loss of important-but-not-really character, reflect on challenges overcome. Oh, and apparently a five-story space warship can be crashed by flicking a single switch from the gunner's chair.
[Sp Off]

Check that, I can't even give it two stars the more I think back.

If you completely check your brain at the door or like to download and watch fancy sci-fi screensavers then you might get 2 hours of entertainment out of this.

Just pass on it until the full cut is released next year - maybe that will be worth it."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun space opera. Enjoyable characters. epic scenery and exciting fight scenes . Story line typical of sci-fy space operas.
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst films I've ever seen, pacing feels completely wrong and so many unnecessary moments."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is definitely the most ridiculous movie I've ever seen. So bad that I had to keep watching expecting it to be less bad. I was surprised that they came up with this movie. A copy of at least 5 different movies. My god the even copied the gladiator and brought the same actor ü§Ø THE WORST MOVIE
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"exceptional, this will be the first brick of a marvelous universe."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,The writing is soooooo bad  no wonder Lucasfilm did not want it. Sooooo soooooo bad
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"I am really sick of critics especially after it became the fashion among them to pan this film. I waited for the ""dull plot"" to begin dragging down the action. Ummm, it never happened. I watched as all sorts of twists and turns kept me riveted. The action was spectacular and the special effects awesome. Your critical reviews were strangely alike and totally worthless. I can't wait for Part 2."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,I actually liked it despise bad reviews. It wasn't something spectacular but it had ok plot and really beatiful looking worlds. It was full of cgi but it was still well made movie. I'm waiting for part 2.
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's like Warhammer 40K mixed with Star Wars, Vikings, and Heavy Metal ‚Äì what's not to like?"
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excelente pel√≠cula, la recomiendo demasiado"
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very well done. 
I do wonder how many times I must read ""professional"" reviews, that repeat themselves. Saying, I want something new. But, these reviewers  'repeat' themselves, nothing is new for them. 
While not a perfect story. We travel to world were we entertained and can pass the time.
Snyder's style is his, creative. Many time times with new ideas. Many times looking and using the past. All movies and books do the same.
Great way to pass a few hours. I look forward to Part 2!"
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,He should have just come out and sad he was doing a sci fi remake of the Magnificent Seven. I have watched it twice and this movie is just a mess.
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Is bad how they did, the history is interesting but they make it so dumb for a 4 year old kid, sad it is as these way made. Producer or director error (horror) ?"
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I've seen everything before, in other films that told their story better. However, the movie is nicely made, and I miss good science fiction, so I'm still waiting for part 2 and I regret that this one is not better. It has potential"
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is a less compelling version of ""A Bug's Life"". The characters are either dressed as 1800s American settlers or as steampunk Nazis. I hope the good bugs band together to defeat the grasshoppers in part two."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,I really don't understand the vitriol. I thought it was great. Was it like other Sci-Fi Space Operas? Yes. Was the story super original? No. But it was visually stunning and engaging enough to not be even close to boring. Sofia Boutella is amazing as is Ed Skrein. Ray Fisher is always solid. I loved it and can't wait until the Part 2!
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"I felt the movie was a good shoot-em-up with lots of action. I respect rebels because they have to fight the man and it is tough to fight the man. The rebels were heroes and they were fighting a very mean establishment. That establishment was seriously mean and snaky, although I shouldn't call them snaky because snakes are just doing their thing, mean has nothing to do with it."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This was a really good movie. Storyline and cinematography was different from the norm, not sure why it has bad reviews."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was excited to see this, but after 20 mins. I turned it off, it was boring. Then I thought I will give it another shot, maybe It will get better. It didn't. I only watched 45 mins. It is so bad. I rarely stop watching a movie. So for me to stop watching it, It has to be really bad."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Incredibly bad film. Repeating the main devices and plotlines of classic sci-fi films would be fine if they could make the story or the characters even remotely interesting and engaging. You feel no connection with the characters and it's unclear why many of them are even there. The costume summed up the movie when they put the bad guy into a shirt and tie... Yes, in a sci-fi film set in another time/space where apparently the hardest thing to do is grow some food. Absolutely ridiculously bad film, never seen anything worse."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not a great movie, but good and I was entertained. it is way better than the low score the critics gave it."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Super contenido de esenografia.
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,I really wanted this movie to be great. After what Disney has done to Star Wars I was hoping someone would give us a new sci-fi franchise that was exciting and interesting but unfortunately Rebel Moon isn't it. I feel it would have made for a better series than it did movie. It felt rushed and it didn't give me the character building and back story I was wanting. Hopefully the extended version and part 2 will give me more of what I was hoping for. It was visually appealing but way too much slow motion.
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"I actually like it a lot, sure they borrowed things from here and there, but really, who doesnt, the only really original scy-fy i can remember is leviathan the serie from AU.
Now, what i did appreciate, superbe visual and someone who knows what atmos sound is really about, now i saw the trailer for part 2 and what everybody say is missing will be reveiled, to me, it was great entertainement"
"Dec 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Is was good...not great. Glad the ""part 2"" isn't as long of a wait as the Part 2 of Mission Impossible."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,terrible! such a waste of potentially great premise
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Nada parecido com star wars, quem compara a isso acho que n√£o entende muito de fic√ß√£o, e claro que o diretor sofre muita persegui√ß√£o pela impressa, a parte 01 √© excelente!"
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Really interesting visuals and special effects but the storyline and script was trash.
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Awful. Weak plot. Visually appealing. Zero relationship building between characters who after a short interaction got recruited into a rebellion. Dialogue was just sad. I wanted to like this. Save yourself some time and skip it. 
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was a hard watch. The scenes, many of which seem to be repurposed from older sci-fi films, seemed almost entirely disconnected from each other. The character writing is non-existent, there was no reason to care about any of them although the movie is nice enough to tell us about a romantic subplot it never showed. It's not actually a story, just assembling a thin cast to tell us there WILL be a story. If someone took the opening scenes from Suicide Squad, removed the music, and stretched them out to a full length film you would have about the same experience. With more color."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Derivative and a poor repeat of Seven Samurai
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic film! The action, plot, and performances were excellent. This movie was a pleasant surprise."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great popcorn movie, does what it needs to do, entertain. Chapter two looks very promising and really look forward to it!"
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was excited for this movie and ended up being extremely disappointed.  I tried to find one conversation in the entire movie that actually felt ""real"", ie. would real people actually say this.  The beginning was ok, the viking village was a cool idea.  The slow motion was awful.  I could write several pages with all the issues I had, but to sum up, it's honestly the worst movie I've ever seen, and that was so disappointing because I had genuine excitement for this film.  The trailers were very good"
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"""star wars"" for PTSD affected LGTB  interstellar losers."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,The film is awful and especially the scenario. How something that bad exists ...
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Just terrible. Derivative story, woeful script, gormless acting, laughable CGI, bizarre directorial choices, a lens flare for every scene, aeons of exposition, leaden pacing. From the opening sequence when our hero is lovingly grasping fistfuls of soil in a quasi-sexual manner, through the tortuously uninteresting assembly of the seven nouveau samurai, and on (and on) through the swamp of dull set-up for part two, this film goes nowhere and does very little, and what it does do, takes twice as long as it should. It wouldn't know an original idea if it jumped up and bit it. Unless it's out of morbid curiosity, I'd avoid this lumpen mishmash of other people's poorly rendered ideas at all costs. 2 hours and 14 minutes of your life you'll never get back."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it, and I'm so looking forward to watching the extended version and part 2.
Charlie Hunnam as kai is amazing üëè üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè"
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"For some reason, critics can no longer be trusted. This was fantastic, with lots of action and some good laughs. Is it a 10/10 story, no. Is it a highly entertaining sci-fi action movie? Yes!"
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is getting bad reviews because it glorifies a rebellion against an empire. Thats not been allowed since the original  Star Wars because it inspires. Firefly tried it and was sabotage only two succeeded after it was canceled. I loved this movie. You will too.
"Dec 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was actually a lot better than i was expecting.

My only real gripe was how similar some scenes felt to other movies. Oh and the bad guy wearing a shirt and tie like he was going to the office was pretty stupid looking."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie can't wait for part 2
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Normally I feel the critics are accurate with their reviews. I don't get the negative vibes for Rebel Moon. The action set pieces are fantastic. The diverse cast give strong performances. The story is a bit predictable, but most science fiction flicks are these days. The film does a nice job of telling a story, introducing characters while setting the stage for the 2nd film. My teenage boys loved it... a good popcorn movie."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is among the most stupid ones I've ever seen. Everything is so literal, the characters spend their time explaining why they do what they do (to make sure that we, the poor stupid audience, clearly understand what we absolutely must understand), the characters have no stakes, it's blatantly obvious, it's unbearable. I hate it when a director treats me like an idiot!"
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely amazing movie! Exactly what keeps driving science fiction and fantasy films. A must watch!!
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The constant slow motion cinematography felt so out of placed and over used that the actual effect it was supposed to have became a miss. The cast was heavily underused as the film tried to balance itself between being a sci-fi thriller and a grind house film. 

Plot was extremely lacking as the entire glue for this ragtag band of heroes was to protect a farm from a force that we seen on screen level an entire kingdoms and worlds but 5 people could really whip farmers together to fight off that military force.

The story seemed to have great things but they feel hidden behind a paywall made of a DIRECTORS CUT AND a PART II."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,I'd echo what some of the critics have said a    boring star wars like rip off with no story. There is nothing moving or motivating but pretty pictures and really good looking slomo.
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed this movie because it has a really good story, the cinematography is beautiful and the music fits perfect. I wasn't sure if I was going to like it, but I loved it. Very entertaining and I highly recommend watching it and having some popcorn with it."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was really good if you like sci-fi. Cool unique worlds and races/aliens. Don't read any further if you like what I just mentioned and just go watch it and enjoy. 

I believe it was intentional to not have all questions of the character's backgrounds answered. More questions will likely be answered and certain things addressed in part 2. Critics argued that it lacked substance but then if all questions would have been answered the critics would say the film was pandering. Nothing will ever please critics of most sci-fi because they have no imagination and make it difficult for the genre to succeed. My only dislike of the film was the overuse of slow motion in action sequences. It was still cool but a bit unnecessary I think."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Tasteless movie, shallow plot, rushed action scenes, caricatured characters. I'm not picky when it comes to action movies, but this is the first time I've stopped watching before the end."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Absolutely waste of time. Incoherent storytelling and a blatant ripoff of Warhammer 40k.
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's an enjoyable watch, there is just nothing new or interesting about it."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Ignore the haters and think for yourself. Finally an original sci-fi/fantasy movie that lacks the nauseating stench of Lucas. I loved sharing some bonding time with my teenage daughter with this film and we're excited for what's to come. The effects were a health mix of cgi and mind bending live action stunts. The story was a great set up for more stories to come. The acting and script writing is far above par for genre. I can't wait for more.
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I also made an account just to comment on this. Like a lot of people said it was predictable. The acting was literally atrocious, i knew right away that the brother wasn't going to be important. Dont know anything about any of the characters, no background at all just quickly introduced them like we already had an idea, didnt even see a connection between them to join up together, no chemistry. Also how quick and easy it was to convince them all it was just lame."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Literally think this platform sucks but i logged in to give this movie the rating it deserves‚Ä¶
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visually spectacular, but a 5 year old could tell a better story. Half of the scenes were incoherent and immaterial to the story and the reasons given for every plot development were shallow and, frankly, stupid"
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Pedazo de porquer√≠a para morritos y se√±ores f√°cilmente impresionables. Ni buena foto tiene, no sabe ni capturar atmosferas realistas, solo hacer encuadres sim√©tricos, cualquier mico puede hacer eso."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Starting watching with my 11 year old son. He said it was too cringe and boring. Then there was some action. Then more unlikable characters. Then we watched Fail Army instead. It's really bad.
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I can't believe someone spend all that money and wasted all those talented actors time in a movie as bad as this. I mean, the plot is a patchwork of non related topics most of which are dropped without any reason, the characters a really poor caricatures and you don't get to connect with any of them and most of all the number of references (if you're being nice), or as I would call them: straight up plagiarisms are the final detail on a total waste of time (and money probably). 
I mean we got 7 samurais, Star Wars, Wild West stuff, gladiator and when you think it's over even matrix on it and it still sucks.

Give yourself a favor and never watch this."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,What a good start to re-fuel all 0f us Baby Boomers
"Dec 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Overall an enjoyable film, though it is a bit derivative and is strangely paced. The main set pieces are very watchable and have some interesting visual touches. There's a lot going on, and it seems that it would have been better as a miniseries with time to flesh out each of the characters. The general structure of the seven samurai is to spend time building up the characters of the supporting squad so that their eventual deaths are meaningful. Here, we spent a little too much time on the bad guys and search for the squad, rather than on the squad themselves.  Thus, we really don't care enough about the crew. Perhaps that work will be done in part two.

In any case, the visuals and action were enough diversion for a few hours."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,La trama no se sostiene a lo largo de la pelicula; no se profundiza en los personajes. las escenas de acci√≥n es lo que hace la pel√≠cula llevadera
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Too many similarities with the story of Thanos going into defeating multiple worlds saving a girl. Similarities with Star Wars and Ray. It definitely wasn't a clever storyline. Most of them were stolen ideas. The action could've been more gory and detailed. The preview was definitely way more entertaining than the actual movie. I give it one out of five stars I wish I could get my 2 1/2 hours back.
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,Bad movie. Obviously inspired in the seven samurai movie. Poor acting. Poor special effects.
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Where it misses the mark in character development and plot it far exceeds in excitement and imagery. The RT Pro reviews say more about them than the movie.
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Probably good for a teen going through their edgy phase, but other than that, it's filled to the brim in cringe."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme que te prende do come√ßo ao fim
Universo lindo e cheio de possibilidades"
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,It wasn't good. It is a combination of every generic action/ sci-fi movie trope there is. Storyline is weak and character development is severely lacking. The actual video looked nice with pretty solid special effects.
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,A fascinating introduction to a new universe. I want to see much more. Definitely much more interested in this than new Star Wars stuff.
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed the movie from start to finish, I think critics are always searching for Oscar performances and forget that movies are to entertain."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The film was entertaining from a visual effects perspective. I appreciated that the story moved quickly, however the plot was predictable and somehow felt like it's been ""done before"". I found myself anticipating outcomes which materialized. Unfortunately, this can make a film lack luster. Rating of 2.5 Stars. Hopefully Part 2 will provide unforeseen plot twist and more action."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I think the movie would have benefitted from more back story about the ruling force, but that being said it was enjoyable and worth the watch. Hope part two builds a more complete picture of this Universe."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Its a great movie. Its enjoyable. The scenes are great with acutal locations and CGI.  The story is relatively simple and watch this to enjoy.
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Pelicula mala mala mala, otra vez la mujer ultrapoderosa que puede con todo. Me hace gracia tambien que esten al descubierto en un tiroteo (contra soldados experimentados) por varios segundos y no les dan ni una bala es algo surrealista ni siquiera se molestan en buscar coberturas ni nada. La historia basica plana y sin sentido, y ademas los actores no lo actuan nada bien con planos de las caras a 1 milimetro de la camara y un monton de camaras lentas que no benefician nada. Y como cosas buenas ... No hay nada."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyable film. It does have familiar themes but they are good themes.
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"It must be cool these days to dump on movies as a past time. This movie had good actors and actresses, a decent story and great visual effects. Not every movie has to be thought provoking."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Buenas pel√≠cula, los sucesos se dan r√°pido, pero es aceptable, los efectos especiales son excelentes y la intriga de la segundo parte."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"O filme tem um roteiro extremamente pregui√ßoso. O universo √© legal, a edi√ß√£o √© muito fora de timming. Acho q ainda da tempo de corrigir os problemas para os proximos filmes da saga, ent√£o tenho expectativas de que melhore. N√£o √© horr√≠vel, mas n√£o √© uma grande aventura envolvente, como gostar√≠amos."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Look, did I enjoy it? Yes, it was worth the watch. But was it great? No, far from it actually. The best I could describe how I feel about this film was that it felt like a sequel film. You get into these characters lives with barely any context or build up, which creates the inability to buy in to the entire story. I loved the casting, they had the talent for an amazing film, but scripting and character depth kept it from that. This could have easily been a three part series. Again, if you're just looking for a film to watch on a rainy day, watch it."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the movie but you get tell that the pg13 version isn't the final version. So much is missing from the action scenes but beyond that the characters I could connect with on an emotional level.
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was total and complete garbage.  No character development, plot was lame and the CGI was horrible.  A majority of the movie was like the Rick and Morty espisode where they make fun of heist films where they assemble a team of rando's for the heist.  Hot freaking mess of a movie."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible rehash of the seven samurai/magnificent seven and other films with a terrible nod to Star Wars.  
Just trash story, bad acting and poor lighting."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Yes its a broth of various sci-fi stock, that said it filled a gap in the market for a decent space opera, and I loved it. May the schwartz be with you!"
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So, movie was very derivative.   Basically if you have seen seventh samurai/magnificent seven + star wars, you know the basic plot.   Heck, a post apocalyptic seventh samurai could be interesting but the character development is 0 in this movie so it misses the point.  Over used dark filter just further drags down the movie as everything is washed out.   Just overall not a good movie, and not worth the time to watch it."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Epic filmmaking is what you get in Rebel Moon. Beautiful imagery with an interesting story. Does it hurt that you only get part of the story in one film? Maybe, but I'm willing to wait until April to get my answers. Do you see reflections of other sci-fi franchises in Rebel Moon? Sure you do. Same as you do in most any sci-fi film. I'm sold on the vision. Ready to wait for the payoff."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved this movie. I think critics tend to hate most of these movies and that's ok. Great action. I really enjoy the universe that's building. It feels like a Star Wars universe but it isn't.
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was a brilliant movie and a breath of fresh air to see an original film series start out, my only criticism is that it did not go on long enough.

Brilliant visuals, unexpected twists and a story and characters that I loved almost immediately."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visual effects and music and the effort of the actors is why this gets 2 stars, other than that. Booooo"
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Every part of this is predictable, poorly written, and pretty much just Star Wars. I hope they don't make more."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I made my first account to comment on this ""film."" Please never again. Zero stars. Who ever directed this should be flipping burgers for a living."
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,WTF how is this so low did i watch a completly different movie than the other 37 procent???? So happy this movie is breaking records and being no1 worldwide!! More of this please!!!
"Dec 29, 2023",POSITIVE,Actually enjoyed this despite the negative reviews! Follow me on instagram @legendslounge_tv_and_film
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,NOW THIS IS CINEMA!!!
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,I hade the great honor watching this movie with my parents! We all loved it it was so fun fresh and vibrant. Can not wait for part 2! This is truly one of those movies for the fans not critics
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Every scene and every line is dark and depressing throughout , not one character is worth caring about , it was just a dark pointless waste of a few hours . I've seen B movies with better characters and production"
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Complete and utter trash.  I really wanted to like this but I knew this movie was in trouble when the first scene is a ship and portal that resembled genitals.   Really?!?!  The dialogue was bad.  The backstory hodgepodge.  Despite some actions sequences the movie at times was dull.  Some of the design was completely uninspired.  There was about 20 minutes of a good movie and the rest was just terrible.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautifully shot, palpable action, great underrated ensemble cast, interesting characters, and a ton of heart.  A bit rushed at times, but I'm looking forward part 2 and the extended cuts!"
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ouch. Looks good. Sour on the inside. Couldn‚Äôt turn it off fast enough. V disappointing pace story and lack of care for the characters 
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"In Italy we have a song that says ""you are the copy of a thousand summaries""... This film does everything to please and has nothing to say. It's reminiscent of Kurosawa's Seven Samurai but with a lot of CGI or little soul"
"Dec 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,I cannot say i truly enjoyed the movie
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a simple, straightforward fun movie with absolutely stunning visuals. Sure the plot seemed to stall for a while but not enough for me to take my eyes off it."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Perfecttttttttttttttttttttttt
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, very reminiscent of Star Wars while keeping an original feel."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Zack borrows heavily from other sources which isn't a bad thing but even though they spent a lot of money to make it look good it feels like an 80s move surfing the space wave star wars started and cast feels like they rounded a bunch of people up at a comic con and let them write the movie on the fly.
 absolutely average"
"Dec 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It entertained me. It can have its cringy and predictable moments and It's basically  Magnificent Seven in Space, but I like both so it's a yes for me. Looking forward to see what another cut brings and part 2 and hoping it gets a little better."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wish I hadn't bothered watching this at the cinema. No character development, no development of the plot. No good acting in sight. Felt like they rushed to make this"
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sometimes people reviews just shocking. And this is such a case.
Rebel Moon amazing movie, it has everything you expect from modern Sci-Fi: interesting world, story, characters, great fights, fantastic graphics. It's beautiful, entertaining and fun to watch. 
Does it has cliches? Yes. Does it has parallels with other great movies? Yea. Does it make this movie bad? No."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Whoever wrote this movie needs to stop.  I enjoyed the visuals and some of the characters but the storyline was a train wreck.
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,I'll watch the R rated version
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Worst movie I have seen in 2023. Extremely slow, nothing happen for 80 mins. Very disappointing cheap final battle. Movie finale is a Star Wars wannabe stuff. Looking forward to seeing how bad is part 2."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Possibly the worst film I've seen, it felt like it stole ideas off of many great films and didn't try to hide the fact it was stealing them. Great actors but a poorly written script."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It is generally true that if you create characters in a story that are so vibrant, dynamic, flawed, relatable, and cunning that they themselves will tell the story for you.  Apparently, the character bios created here before preproduction were about one paragraph each. I'm not sure what this team was trying to do. It's like painting a picture with a single brush stroke. It's not going to turn out anything like what you intended and you'll end up with an incomplete and unsatisfying result. You are not always able to depend on visual effects or a directors cut."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is an awful movie. I have no idea why anyone would choose to make it on d they had read the script. It's appalling bad.
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible and unbelievable script, wooden acting, and utterly predictable action scenes. It was just annoying. Regarding the script‚Äôs premise - this super rich, world conquering society needs grain from farmers on a remote planet? Please!"
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was a Total misser, bad story, the pace of the movie does not make sense, the acting is not the best....... but specially the overuse of slow-motion in the battles got me very annoyed. It's a pity I was hoping I would be at least decent üòï.  I like other movies of zack but not this one. 
"
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,The character introduction and backstory is bad or abscent
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Horrible drivel.  Plot was weak.  Terrible use of Charlie Hunnam's acting abilities and a weak female lead.  Don't waste your time.
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie reminded me of a story I have wrote when I was 12 years old. Same storyline, great threat, collect x,y and z, betrayal and so on. And of course due to my age they lacked character development, and context for anything, no memorable characters or no meaningful relationship developed. Back then I remember that after reading it again I figured it was not so great so I decided to do with it what you do with garbage stories, toss them in a drawer and forget about them or even better repurpose the paper. Little did I know it had the exact requirements for a Hollywood  movie and at an early age I have written something equivalent with one of the great writers in the industry. Oh my, how the quality of movies and storytelling has dropped."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed this movie. Seemed a cross between star wars and hunger games.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is enjoyable, the story is a little slow, but the action and video effects are great!!"
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring, Cliche, Hard to suspend disbelief"
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good movie, totally recommended"
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Reminded me of Chronicles of Riddick. Might not be as good as that movie, but I still enjoyed watching it"
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visually fun, but poorly paced grittier, remake of Battle Beyond the Stars, which in turn was a remake of The Seven Samurai trying to cash in on Star Wars. History repeats itself."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,The introduction of 4 characters through planet hopping was weak.  I hope this world is expanded upon as it seems rich with new ideas.  The mood is consistent and dark but this could have been written differently with the similar effect.
"Dec 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,I like the concept and the universe. It feels like some producers got ahold of the directors movie and did their own editing. I hear there is another version of this that is longer? Interested to see what that version is like.
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very little character development.  Such a simple all-too-common plot.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,movie was awesome good story it could've of been a starwars movie probably better it wasn't finally something new than starwars and im a starwars fan! i watched 3xs
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Firstly, in terms of the rating I think 7/10 is more precise and reasonable. Not sure how ppl are giving it a 1/5 or anything around or less than that fractionally. Those reviews, to me, seem driven by some peculiar emotional mix; ""worst movie"" or things of that sort, I sense, are written by folks that either don't watch many films, had a bad day, or don't know how to assess films like this.
Now to the movie; it's a hodgepodge of parts of other cinematic IP, which is not a novel notion considering the director openly stated that it was pitched as a Star Wars spinoff. Can't quite tell if it feels more like star wars, dune, or, at times, a Western but, for sure, it doesn't feel too original. The dialogue is o.k. I was expecting more/better, however, the acting is stellar. The cast picks up for any slack, and so, it seems appropriate and relevant to identify that and take it into account with gradation. It's worth noting the movie has its share of puzzles it never quite places, and, side persons i feel it should invest more time in expanding on. Film is littered with a lot of interesting pictorial angles. 
Act 2 is best IMO.
If you're looking for space fighting aesthetic grandeur and a decent plot this is for you.
Perhaps the sequel will build better on the things missed but the movie is a ""good"" watch."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst. Science fiction movie. Ever.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,I think this was a great starting point for a bigger universe. The acting was a bit off in some areas but really wasn't too bad. The visuals were amazing and I wouldn't expect anything less from this director.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed it. As a sci-fi genre fan for over 30 years I would give it 8/10, but that is my take on that. I don't care what those self appointed movie critics say about it. I think it was really good and I am waiting for the next one"
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The definition of "" how to make an expensive movie without a single original idea"""
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Its really just a live actionacifyversion of a Bugs life......hahahaha
Unfortunately it kinda flopped.characters had no depth world building wasnt very good. Either wasnt even cool space looking stuff....not very much imsgination involved"
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"An absolutely terrible movie in every way. Bland and predictable plot, comically evil villains, cardboard characters, boring action with infuriating slow-mo, stealing everything from far better IPs... Zach really lost it"
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just a continuous slow motion snooze fest.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,It has the combined feel of other sci-fi movies but in a tasteful manner that still sucks you in and leaves you wanting more!
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie.  It had a lot of action. Great storey line.  It has me looking forward to the new movie.    Strong female lead.  (Which I think is why people are being critical) 

This is not a star wars movie so do not compare it to star wars.  

10/10 for me"
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the worst movies I've watched in 2023. Everything what was bad in recent Star Wars times ten.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,I think it's a great start to a new franchise!
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,I have never experienced a film that felt so bloated while simultaneously feeling completely empty.
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Meh. As Yogi Berra said, it's like deja vu, all over again. While it had high production values and fine acting, the plot seemed unremarkable, familiar, derivative - mainly of Star Wars (even the blasters make the same beeyoo-beeyoo-beeyoo sound).  About every 20 minutes I'd raise the remote to switch away.  Right then a kick-butt fight would erupt, so I'd stay, eventually raise the remote. Another fight.  Warcraft uses the same trick to keep players playing. The main character Kora (Sofia Bouttela) is believably intense, athletic and can kick the horns off 8 charging rhinos. The antagonist Nobel (Ed Skrein) is suitably sociopathic in his role as an admiral of a (too) Naziesque strike force from the Motherworld. He plans to extract one harvest from the farming world Kora is on and then wipe out the population - an idea that makes no economic sense - but galvanizes Kora to assemble a ragtag army of rebels.  This whole hero's journey has been done a billion times before. You can tell where this story is going the moment you lay eyes on Kora fitting into her adopted farming village like Riddick into an all-girls kindergarten class. The plot is like Muzak where the tune is familiar but the highs and low have been taken out."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Mama, this is garbage!"
"Dec 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,Sometimes cliche but visually engaging
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely a 40k robbery without the decency of including a plot or any character development. Some fun visuals, Absolutely vapid world-building. Leading actress should stick to dance, she can't act, the script didn't help. The empire of the motherworld calls its leader a ""king""... now I'm not sure if that was to avoid a games workshop lawsuit, but either way that fact alone about sums up this joke of a movie."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I absolutely loved this movie, so fresh, so serious. I'm so sick of unnecessary humor bombs inserted in movies nowadays. I was skeptical to watch this due to all the negatives reviews but I absolutely loved it 8.5/10."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,really bad. never seen something so bad.
"Dec 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This needed to be much longer and actually give a bit of character development. You build a ragtag bunch of heroes but don't give me any reason to care if they live or die. 
This could and should have been the universe that filled the hole Disney left behind when they butchered Star Wars.

Yet I feel like half the movie or more was left on the cutting room floor.

Who is the lady with the swords? We don't know...they just turned up to the planet she was on and brought her along... Why? Don't know! She's just part of the group now and that's a running theme of the movie...stuff just happens with little to no explanation why. 
Characters die but you don't really care because you aren't given the chance to get to know them in the first place.

This movie would have been best suited as a 10 hour series. Or at the very least a 3+ hour epic.

So much potential. Yet so disappointed."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought this movie was a great opening to a potentially fascinating movie series. Although it was a bit hard to become instantly captivated i believe it would make a fantastic start point for a much bigger picture. Visually it was a masterpiece and character development 10/10. I would say similar to star wars
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun Sci-Fi action romp through a universe with captivating world building.
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Los personajes no llegan a hacer conexion entre ellos
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wow!  This stinks!  The acting is just beyond terrible.  The plot is so boring and predicable.  The characters are all stolen from other movies (i.e. Star Wars, Aviator, Marvel etc).  DO BETTER HOLLYWOOD!!!"
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Epic! Fun to watch! Waiting for part 2
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is an absolute mess it tries to do 20 different things at once and never does one well. The story is all over the place. If you watch this, Star Wars: The Last Jedi will feel like a masterpiece in comparison."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was üî•! It had the right amount of story and action for sci-fi. I really enjoyed it and will watch it again and again. Visual were amazing. I can't wait for part 2.
"Dec 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ok, so I have really mixed feelings around this film. Definitely has some similarities with Star Wars, and other SiFi films but has it's own story. Really great effects, and perfectly designed sets. Where it falls short is the plot and characters. Outside of Charlie's (Played Jax from SOA) character, they simply aren't interesting. The plot for recruitment of the ""Rebel"" force feels rushed. I think the bones of this story had promise, but the lead protagonist and most of the supporting cast just aren't interesting enough to pull you in. I'm invested enough to watch the second movie, but I don't have high hopes."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,Anything that the Critics on Rotten Tomatoes dislike tends to be worth a watch. This is So much better than that Trash Movie that Obama and His husband Michael Produced...
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"1) It is supposed to be a movie. Show. Don't. Tell. It is just so laboriously slow with an intro of seemingly endless narration.

2) A good movie is more than a collection of action scenes strung together with monologues and narration.

Lots of interesting concepts but not put to good use. Plot makes very little sense.  For example, the evil empire is evil for the sake of being evil.

Evil Empire: Hey we can sell/give you farming robots so you can have massive yields.
Farmers: Naw we want to work by hand, we are just a tiny farming community on this planet and don't exactly grow much food.

A semi-intelligent evil empire would say, okay, cool. Then take their farming robots and farm the hell out of a different part of the planet to get the food they need. Maybe offering to pay for some time with their master gardener.

But nope, instead they kill a couple people, and drop off their most sadistic troops to ensure their plan goes to hell in a hand basket right away. Protagonists can't be chronically stupid and yet have a track record of amazing competence.

It simply isn't very good."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Great visual effects with some good action sequences but character development so shallow they'd drown in a puddle. No real character development, weak script writing which sadly lets down some great actors. If it had a better script this could have been a great film."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think the stark chasm between the critics and viewers is proof critics are severely out of touch with what people love and enjoy. It does not matter if it has elements from other IP, so does literally everything. The film is epic fun. Stop hating."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's nothing original but I always dig a Korusawa adventure.
"Dec 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"its kinda slow to get the story going, big plot twist at the end but i did like the character how bad-ass she is. Love the eye candy."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's awful. I do not recommend.
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'll start off by saying I do love science fiction movies. But what did I just watch. The movie has a weak storyline and a lot of random characters from different timelines and mythologies, why?? It was like watching a mixture of avatar, star wars, harry potter, the gladiator and Tarzan who all join up to battle a few nazis. So very disturbing. üòµ‚Äçüí´ And one really bad nazi gets all his teeths knocked out in the end, no wait, all the teeths are back in place i next scene."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Flat storyline , bad accents and takes a lot of effort to stay involved. It was like a low budget star wars."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Formulaic & embarrassingly predictable. Nothing original or captivating. 
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Do Not Believe the Critics, go watch the movie for yourself. It is a great movie with an interesting plot and stunning visuals."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Horrid story, characters. Ok visuals."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining. Some parts feel rushed while at the same time there are too many unnecessary scenes with slow motion. I believe the extended version will resolve many of the story and character development problems.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie isn't an original but it's packed with excitement and fun. A digital masterpiece. A decent storyline, excellent acting and great special effects. Anthony Hopkins narration set the movie up to be great right from the start. It's definitely worth a watch."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"My family and I massively enjoyed this film, and look forward to part two! There are  negatives, including some characters receiving less memorable features and backstory than perhaps needed, but I found myself along for the action packed ride in every scene. Certainly worth a watch!"
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring pathwork from past masterpieces of the genre, horrible vfx"
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was hyped about this,because of Zack but it's a cheap and bad Star Wars Copy. Boring Story,boring Characters... And sometimes bad Effects."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Lacklustre storyline and too many cliches, visual effects were good but not enough to hold my interest."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not a great movie by any means. It's a sci fi rehash of Seven Samurai that feels very rushed. The last hour or so of the film is watchable and to a point enjoyable, hopefully part 2 will be better."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining. Visually stunning and interesting story. I do not understand all the online hate, most people i know liked the movie. Good that there is a new original film instead of another prequel or sequal, even if it is inspired by other movies and stories."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Seriously garbage - an embarrassment for the sci-fi genre. A mash up of far better films with cheesy tropes by the score. A heinously clunky script with characters shallower than a puddle that the creators are trying desperately to have us connect with using 15 second back stories (if that) and OTT dramatic music and exposition. CGI/ SFX overload with bad green-screen shots and too many absurd slo-mo's. Why do we need to look forward to the directors' cut if he can't make a decent film in the cinematic cut?
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Buena pel√≠cula de acci√≥n para desconectarse de la realidad... C√≥mo la planteaban esperaba m√°s violencia y m√°s acci√≥n, pero es buena.."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's well not what was advertised. 
It's a enjoyable watch ones.
The movie had big ideas and drowned in rushed story plots and shallow expositions."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"'Battle beyond the stars' (1980) did it better.

I give this film an extra star for Tarak's fine, oiled up abs ... but next time Zach, a little more story and a little less pretenscious slow-mo.
And FFS .. stop using that awful camera lens. When I go to see a movie at the cinema I'm interested to actually SEE the film, and not feel like I'm developing cateracts!"
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Awesome visuals and solid adventure. Definitely watch it and ignore the critics.
"Dec 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Was ok. Not his best , but ok. Need to see the 4 hour version to be sure"
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very much don't understand all the hate and low IMDB and Tomato Score? Usually when this is the case the films end up quite good which means that critics always go in with extreme high expectations, not going their way and so, bad score. 

It's a fresh sci fi, action, adventure which is entertaining and one of those ""can be watched over and over again"" kind of films. It's rare these days for films to have that unique quality. 

Very much excited about part 2 and hope Zack manages to finish what he started."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"predictable ,boring and not fun.
It looked like a bunch of slow motion highlight reels for a bunch of characters no one cares about or is made to care about."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A film poor in ideas, with an overuse of quotations and a trite plot. The characters were not characterized at all."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked it‚Ä¶ waiting for part 2.
Story is great. CGI is not up to the mark at times but good overall. Writer have borrowed some ideas from other movies but they fits perfectly.
Critics are the rotten ones here."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"A Part 1 Experience, again."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie felt a bit disconnected - you never feel that the story is unique - 20 minutes in you realise you are watching a ""highlight real"" of all your favourite action/adventure movies...the accents doesnt match the characters, the costumes are all over the place - we have a ""nazi"" bad guy, han solo wannabe, viking farmer, braveheart's brother and sister, cowboy ninja with lightsabers, a General Gladiator who played in Gladiator with a very similar back story than Maximus and a ""hero"" that escaped from the script of Sucker Punch...and the story line almost feels a bit like ""Foundation meets Star Wars""...one more thing the nazi bad guy is resurrected the same way in which Neo wakes up from the Matrix."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,I've always liked Zack's vision. good movie for me.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,A BEAUTIFUL and BRILLIANT movie!! Cant wait for part two!
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"While some of the CG is quite bad, I really enjoyed this movie over all- yeah, it borrows from many SiFi creations before it, but I thought it was fresh and interesting. I look forward to the sequel."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Seven samurai for gen Z. Not great but not bad. Has potential that the directors cut will fix the uneven pacing. Good special effects and over the top characters. For what amounts to a prequel for a Part 2, sets up the real story that will make our break any future sequels."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it and can't wait for part 2
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, looking forward to part two."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Unsure how people could give this movie anything but 3 star plus. Personally I felt it was the best movie I've seen in a while.I'd describe it as a space adventure movie, where you just need to sit back relax and enjoy the film. I cannot wait for the sequel."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Think ""Bug's Life"" as a space opera with aliens and humans. 
Big bad guys come to take the annual harvest. 
Threaten to hurt everyone if they do not provide a full harvest. 
One of the farmers takes on the role of finding even meaner 'bugs' /people to fight the bad guys away from their farming community.... 
Sword wielding Ninja mercenary named Nemesis 
Bad Han Solo owns a ship 
Roman themes throughout - including a general or two 
A displaced prince who can speak to fantastic beasts (and apparently can handle the massive thermal changes without ever wearing a shirt, but he needs pants 
A bad guy who is killed and then restored to life with a new mission to bring back the kidnapped/adopted daughter of Thanos... wait, no, but kind of... 

... aside from the thin veil of plagiarism, the special effects are pretty good. The story telling is subpar. I watched this because it got 'great' reviews. I see that I was maliciously misinformed."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was pretty good. I feel like the directors cut or 2nd will be even better. With that said I'll probably rewatch again soon. Was visually stunning and thought the story was pretty good with a lot of potential
"Dec 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Acting is what makes or breaks a movie. The storytelling is key so I can see how some review this poorly.  Good action and some CG that was overdone.  Character development seemed rushed, and flowed a tad clunky.  It's rewatchable when the next film releases."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Like a much, much worse version of Star Wars. Extremely cliched stuff. Paint by numbers sci-fi. A cartoonish villain who is dressed like a Nazi. The dude with the Irish accent is unintentionally hilarious because he feels so out of place. After the first 20 minutes, this movie was an absolute meandering slog.

Also, the plot is ripoff of A Bug's Life, lol."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bad in a lot of way, good in very few."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a familiar story with a bit of twist. The movie is definitely laying the foundation and building up to what I think will be an amazing story. I enjoyed it.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the visual effects, the fight scenes and the overall sci fi concept. Most importantly I was entertained by the movie and enjoyed it thoroughly. Isn't that what a movie suppose to do?"
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie, I'm torn between Rebel Moon, and The Creator as my favorite movie of 2023! Definitely recommend watching if you haven't already!"
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Way better than Star Wars. Finally an adult version of Star Wars.
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A really waste of time.
A copy paste of every science fiction franchise."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Rebel moon is a worthy watch, but don't expect to be thrilled. It definitely borrowed the star wars material including the lightsaber.  It's tons of fun though and shouldn't be missed."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visually ok. Truly terrible story, direction and dialog. No original characters or creatures.  Too many characters and they're all ridiculous. Worse than I feared. But not the absolute worst thing I've seen. Actors are like-able. Some of the action sequences are ok. Starts out well enough."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very poor story line and script writing
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing better ending then most things we get and it has a part 2 keep doing great work
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Let's start with the good. Great visuals and acting throughout the movie. 

There is a lot of bad. The story is stale and becomes even worse as almost every situation has a predictable outcome. You also have quite a lot of ""that makes no sense"" moments where it seems something happens to specifically move the storyline forward but also defies rationale.

There was some character development but again, it took a backseat in order to force the story progression. This movie needed at least 30 more minutes of runtime as it didn't progress smoothly and felt extremely rushed/constrained.

I probably need to rewatch it as I dozed off on it a few times (which rarely happens while I'm watching an action movie)."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Treat the movie for what it is. An origin story to a new world. Great movie from the beginning to the end. Was able to watch in one showing can't wait for the next installment
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The first thirty minutes were interesting, even though none of the characters showed any emotions. But after that it just dragged on while going nowhere!"
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,What did I just watch?   I was really excited for this film and maybe I had too high expectations.   I found it lacking...
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"A little cliche, but still a fun Sci Fi movie! Worth supporting new universes that can expand and become even greater in my opinion. Love the risk on a new IP. Worth a watch!"
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good, not great.  Seems like the characters were thrown together kind of fast.  Not a lot of meaningful interaction that made me care about any of them.  I'm most interested in the robot who doesn't want to fight."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining. Great visuals . This is a solid action move that is well done and Sofia Boutella is the ultra rare actress who plays a convincing female military character. Not deep or philosophical but entertaining  escapist entertainment.
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is the worst movie I've ever seen. It's the perfect homage to the popular media of this Era. Soulless unoriginal nonsense. It's genuinely astonishing how bad this movie is. It's worth watching just to revel in its total failure.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was fantastic!  The world building and cinematography was on point! The story did a good job of introducing us to a new world and the major charcters while laying the foundation for a larger epic story. 

Somthing that I enjoyed in particular was the many visual and story homages this movie pays to some of the great SCIFIs of the 90s. 

It was a fun ride! I highly recommend!"
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Cinematography was distracting. Shooting wide open for the whole movie looks terrible
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Where is the story, ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è you get to the end and you don't actually care for any of the characters. This movie has no heart, there are moments where you almost glimpse the team their trying to build but it misses the mark."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was entertaining but it was definitely overhyped. Some things seemed off, like the story itself, the random slow-mo scenes, and none of the characters had any chemistry or connection. That said, it was visually entertaining, the action scenes were fun (minus the overdone and unnecessary slow-mo scenes), and the series has potential if it's steered back on track. I give it 4 stars because it was a fun watch, and because we need more shows of this production quality on streaming services. Though I hope they can learn from their mistakes."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Great world building but all the character relationships felt super forced and cheesy. Nemesis has the most depth of all the characters and she gets 7 minutes screen time. The design of the characters and the art direction is the only good part about the movie.
"Dec 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Yes, it's all very derivative yada yada yada‚Ä¶but it is entertaining, some interesting characters, good action sequences and for the most part, delivering impressive visuals‚Ä¶let's wait and see what Part II yields in April before getting too carried away‚Ä¶"
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you like Sci fi, you'll like this. Does it have flaws? Yes but it pulls you in, in an unexplainable way."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Awful as a whole. Characters are boring and forgettable. Every scene was stolen from some other sci fi or fantasy great. The only thing this had was great graphics, but with that it also created probably the worst part of the show which is the fact that the fight scenes were ultra violent but only had PG 13 outcomes. In multiple scenes arms were broken, but not really broken. The scenes occur in what should be very gruesome but no gore whatsoever. It just didn't fit together. At least in like a PG 13 Marvel movie the combat matches the outcome. A lot of hype for the ultimate let down."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Beautiful cinematography and action the story also keeps you on the edge of your seat!!
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Like most other people's opionions, this movie has great visuals, but some below par characters and acting. Also Charlie Hunnams Northern Irish accent is just so annoying."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome sci Fi film!!!  I loved it.  Really looking forward to the next part.
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I had high hopes for this, and it's not bad per se. Truly beautiful, action was amazing! It was just too much content in too little time. Jumping from planet to planet, person to person so quickly I couldn't remember main characters' names, let alone feel a compelling connection to them. This would have worked far better as a 6 or even 8 part series so that each world/character could have been explored more in depth. Such huge potential only to over pack it and miss a lot of depth. I will still check out part 2 but can't get over my disappointment at imagining what could have been."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was very appealing visually, but the lack of entertaining writing and borrowed tropes alone can't make a good movie out of a less than appealing narrative. The over abundance of slow motion makes this movie incredibly boring. It is predictable and cannot be carried by its amazing cast alone"
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,I feel like this is gonna be fodder for Mystery science theater 3000.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was one of those ""epic"" movies. Sure, the storyline felt like it was on fast forward at times, and the acting could've been a little better, but this movie satisfies the fantasy of fighting an intergalactic war that isn't too far fetched."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved this. Can't wait for part two.  The slow burn here and there doesn't bother me.  It's setting up part 2.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"I believe the critics got this one wrong, they could only credit the visuals which are epic, but it creates a brand new IP were a female protagonist who has to face the demons of her past to save her future, fantastic!! Avoids the Mary Sue Star Wars narrative also doesn't get bogged down in the metadology of the force or explaining the ability of their warrior, the narrative that ultimately killed star wars over explaining the force and restricting the abilities to someone who was force sensitive. Thankfully this new space opera creates a story of survival and resistance that is both familiar and fresh!! The movie has Star Wars, Avatar and The Matrix inspired moments, moments that shocked cinema and it's definitely recaptured in Rebel Moon!!"
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Great sci-fi film with the epic scale you'd expect from one of Snyder's pieces of art. The only thing missing is more of it! I can't wait for the longer cut and part 2!
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Tiene todo lo que se necesita para adentrarse en un nuevo Universo gal√°ctico.
Muy interesante propuesta, me encant√≥!"
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,What on the garbage did I just watch? Missing plot lines. Rushes to the ending in the longest way possible. I'm still not sure why the protagonist and antagonist started fighting at the end. It's not even an original concept. It could have at least been done better. I made this account just to tell everyone how disappointed I am. Now I know how my father felt.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Dazzling, entertaining, and unexpected brilliance. Will need to watch again on a larger screen!"
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If you like slow-mo and terrible writing, then this is the film for you!"
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It has an OK start to it, although the accents of the bad soldiers was a bit on the nose.

Then it turns into Seven Space Samurai but unlike the original where you understand what they're doing and why it's a lot more ambiguous here. In the original you understand what both sides want and how they plan on achieving it. 

In the original it's a village full of people guided by the ronin in a defensible position. They are against a gang of bandits. This is a winnable fight.

In Seven Go To Space they're defending a village against the equivalent of The Empire in Star Wars. The second they encounter hardship they could just destroy the village. Or the entire planet. Our heroes even seem to acknowledge this... but still don't seem to have any kind of plan beyond join forces and defend the village.

So after they leave the village pretty early in the movie it's just a recruitment drive. We go to next guy and collect for team. We have no plan. It's shockingly boring."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ok so here we go. The sets looked fake and were so damn bland, the cgi was good sometimes but mostly not, you could tell where the sets ended and the green screen started, the plot was dumb and the practical effects were horrible, and too much slowmo. A very average film from an extremely overrated director."
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. In fact it had many many elements of what make a large action science fiction story work. Ignore the critics. Sure it isn't the Martian but enjoy it as it's a fun amazing ride. Can't wait for part 2 and hopefully part 3.
"Dec 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"First of all, having a strong female lead without cheesiness and over the top emphasis is rare, and Rebel Moon has managed to write a great one. The characters and visuals are stunning also. My only gripe is that it's quite slow at points and characters haven't been fully developed but that might be down to it being a two parter so I'll hold my judgement until watching it."
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A truly terrible movie with no engaging charaters. Overly dramatic music, some good acting by the main villain (allthough his resemblance to Hitler is so clich√©) but the rest very bad. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the bad Irish accents. It tries so, so hard to be Star Wars but comes off as desparate. Thinnest of plots. The fighting is so artificial and exaggerated. The death of Darrian Blodaxe with tears in his eyes was downright silly. The fight between the villain and heroine made me laugh it was so ridiculous. And the speach about honouring those who gave their lives? So overly dramatic. I‚Äôve never seen a movie taking itself so seriously and with it‚Äôs head so far up it‚Äôs own a‚Ä¶.Will spare myself watching the sequel!"
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Rebel Moon is a copy paste of everything without any depth in the script...  Don't waste your time with this movie
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,I am so booooooored.
"Dec 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,So confusing and no point to the movie
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Action packed movie with likeable characters.  It had a Star Wars fight against the empire vibe and entertained. Can't wait for the sequel
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Solid movie definitely gonna watch the sequels, no idea why people are bombing it"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Disappointed. Definitely not for children. R rated.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Os efeitos visuais s√£o fant√°sticos, assim como a hist√≥ria inicial, infelizmente o casting deixa muito a desejar, visto que n√£o h√° qu√≠mica entre os atores, dando a sensa√ß√£o que foram atirados para o filme sem terem muito com que trabalhar, visto que o gui√£o √© muito pobre. A atriz principal, Sofia Boutella, deixa muito a desejar, dando a sensa√ß√£o que n√£o tem capacidade para um projeto desta envergadura. O desenrolar da hist√≥ria torna-se muito previs√≠vel com a√ß√£o muito pobre. Infelizmente, queriam fazer de Rebel Moon o novo ""Star Wars"", mas calhou o novo ""Jupiter Ascending""."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the most fun sci fi films I've seen in years. What Star Wars prequels and sequels should have been.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I can't believe how boring and uninspired this was. There are some cool cinematic shots, that's about it."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great fast paced sci-fi special.  Wish the second part was released as well.  Acting was awesome, the CGI and makeup spot on!  The alt worlds and details and alt life forms were just amazing!"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Interesting premise, but the story really needed to be refined. Even after watching the whole thing, I have no sense of the power balance or what is and is not possible in the universe."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's an enjoyable movie. It feels like it's on fast-forward, but enjoyable nonetheless. Certainly more could be here, and will be later."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"My wife and I sat down to watch the movie on our big 85 inch TV. It is a fantastic movie to watch on a high-quality television. The cinematography and CGI was beautiful. I loved the action and loved the seriousness of the movie a lot more than, most of the cheesy and corny marvel movies of late. We are now looking forward to watching the Directors cut and part two.  Could they have spent more time building the characters, maybe. Either way, we enjoyed the movie, and I may watch it again."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Everything felt rushed.  The movie would have been better off it was a mini series of so that all of the characters' backstories could be fleshed out.

I look forward to part 2."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. The reviewers are wrong on this.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Movie was okay, the story was not up to snuff"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Keep going zack we love your movies üé¨
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The film is generic, boring and ridiculous on every level but entertaining at least. Wasted potential."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was absolutely stunning visuals aside I think its snyders best movie writing wise everything was connected it all made sense, the slow mo wasnt just their for flare it allowed us to view the land scapes of all these new worlds and environments the tropes the choreography was immensely brilliant the music set the tone immensely well. 

      From top to bottom it was a very good movie some things were cut yes, however the book fills in the holes until the directors cut comes out."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good effects with a plot made up from Star Wars/Dune/Guardians of the Galaxy & countless other sci-fi movies. 
Total lack of originality but an easy watch."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,I thought it was pretty fun in its current state but really wish they'd just release the final cut from the start.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,It is ok to be derivative as long as you can bring a compelling depth to your story and characters. Sadly Rebel Moon is paper thin tracing paper. Shallow and jumbled bits copied from far greater films. No amount of slow-mo fighting  or CG visuals can save the lackluster writing.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Boring simple story. Slowmotion sucks. Totally unrealistic turn of events.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible movie copycat of everything sci-fi terrible lead actor no backstory no lead up really really bad writing
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie brings the worst character development I have seen in years. The story and even the acting is terrible. It is a visually striking movie that should be only played when focusing on other activities.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,A Bugs Life.....in space
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"De belles images, une belle r√©alisation. Certains trouveront que le film copie d autres films, d autre y verront un hommage peut √™tre √™tre un peu appuy√©. Un bon moment, un bon spectacle. Un peu court pour une histoire autant diversifi√©e. Pas assez de moments forts r√©serv√©s aux grands acteurs. Une version longue est annonc√©e, attendons la avec impatience pour un peu mieux juger"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was amazing. I'd like to see more character development and back-story for some of the characters, hopefully we'll see that in the director's cut. Looking forward to part2!"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Typical no substance movie.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I wanted to like this but we've all seen this story before. The action scene didn't hit right and the characters just didn't connect with the audience in my house.  I don't know how the studios let this one out like this. Visually, some scenes just looked photoshopped and the 300 styled slowmo scenes are played out. The story was also just a copy and paste.  We must do better and tell better stories."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Nothing ground breaking but an enjoyable movie overall.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,A worse version of better movies. How do you make Seven Samurai in space bad? Truly an impressive feat. Characters get an introduction when they're recruited then get 2 lines of dialogue for the rest of the movie. Incredibly soulless ripoff that relies on tropes we've seen in dozens of sci-fi movies.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great cgi, good Story and the beginning of a new franchise. The characters are  a bit flat but lets wait for episode 2 !"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visuals are great, however the story was very lacking.  Meandered about and didn't built out really any of the side characters.  Could not even finish watching it."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worse than i could imagine honestly
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Completely derivative, terribly executed. Don't waste your time."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Omg loved it! I love sci-fi I love Star Wars and I get the inspiration but the story is not to be mistaken for a spin off or follow on. It is completely original, it's got a more mature content and I swear to god I did not see the twist coming! Loved the actors chosen for characters *chefs kiss* perfection! Can't wait for part two!"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Rip-off  of the Mag 7 western without the star quality
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"a movie with a lot of action with a lot of bullets, very exciting, many ships aliens something different from any movie of its kind I dawdle too much and I haven't let go since I started seeing her. I invite you to see it, you will not regret it"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"To start, it was fun, and action packed. I am someone that likes to read into what could be and for a story opener I think this movie did great. It started many different possible stories that can be built Apon. It left us with so many great possibilities, Such as Jimmy from the Mechanicas Miltarium bring in more of his kind to protect innocent people or people it deems worthy. I can't wait for future parts."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Visually beautiful and entertaining. Nothing particularly original here, and a bit over the top, but fun to watch. Some of the costume designs, or lack thereof,  pulled me out of the moment in a couple of places."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"A completely serviceable sci-fi romp. Nothing new, but visually appealing. Similar to Jupiter Ascending. Watched it twice and really enjoyed it both times."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visually pretty awesome. The story, characters and actors were very bad. Very little character development. It's hard to invest in the story when you don't care about the characters."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,It feels like the Star Was fan fiction of a 12 year. This movie is devoid of originality.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bad. So bad. There are too many characters with absolutely nothing interesting about them, no motivations and half assed traumatic back stories.

The plot is a mess with yawn worthy lengths of exposition the only thing holding it together.

And the slo mo omg the the slo mo.
Unnecessary, ill-timed and hard to watch. It happens so often and so out of place that the few times it's used correctly aren't impactful whatsoever. It's honestly cringe worthy.

The visuals are trying to be something but the terrible writing and plot just undermine it entirely.

Also way too long to have NoThiNg happen"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I really liked the film! The pacing was a bit slow. The fight scenes were stellar.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Iif you want a fantasy scifi experiance, Rebel Moon does an excellant job. Good character development, well done fight scenes and fairly good story line makes it wortk seeing."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it, watch it and enjoy"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Much needed sci-fi. Can't wait for part two.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,A very fun movie. The visuals were so good and the story is compelling and will only grow with move movies in the future. Excited to see where this goes.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved this movie. Can't wait for part 2!!
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This film contains lots of beautiful scenes without a strong plot connection, character motivation also raises some questions, not great, not terrible"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was highly entertaining and visually stunning. As a life long sci-fi fan, it checked off all the boxes."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Zack's cinematography is as brilliant and fresh as ever. Truly as master at work. Stellar introduction to a vast new world to enjoy and look forward to what's to be uncovered in the highly anticipated Rated R Directors Cuts & Part 2!
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Pretty uninspired. Star Wars : Walmart edition. I want Chapter 2 like I want gout.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Exactly what I expected. It's like last Star Wars trilogy but without the boring dialogue. Worth the watch
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"An infinity unecessary sequence of epicness cliches completly out of context, necessity or justification. It really felt like someone just typed into an ""AI bot"", write an epic movie filled by epic scenes f*yeah, and then filmed the results"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Great start to a new space epic. Continue to improve and add to it!
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Can't get much worse than this
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is really good! the passionate that Zack introduce to their movies is beyond our comprehension. I can't wait for part 2.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Rebel Moon made Batman vs Superman look good. 
It copied other films so much that it looked like a patchwork without any originality ‚Äî a true Frankenstein."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Fell asleep not once, not twice, but THREE times during. New personal best!"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought rebel moon was well done with flashbacks to understand the characters past and helped tie in the emotions that they were going through.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very boring characters and very little happens for a 2+ hour movie
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Rebel Moon is obviously influenced by Seven Samurai and Star Wars, so it's a bit lacking in originality, but it has a compelling story and excellent visuals that make up for it.  It does seem like the mix of characters are from different films sometimes and sometimes too similar.  Overall enjoyable."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Amazing visuals, make-up, and costumes. That's honestly about it. Story telling is akin to someone with ADHD attempting to sum up their day in a cohesive way."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Una buena pel√≠cula para compartir con amigos
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Exelente pel√≠cula muy movida la emoci√≥n, cautiva las escenas de acci√≥n."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was excited about a new, originally scripted sci-fi saga and am happy that something like this got a chance to be made instead of regurgitated remakes and sequels. It was just bad though. Poorly written, unoriginal storyline, bad acting, boring characters, terrible fight scenes... I could go on. The only thing good about this movie is that now I won't waste my time with Part 2."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Set design, story, cinematography, acting, bad, just plain bad. I tried to enjoy it, will never pass up sci-fi but this was just horrible from the start."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,It's was fun and action packed
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible movie, lacking charm and rhythm."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Great as an adult star wars.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed this movie immensely.  Great character development, interesting story and immesive visuals.  I look forward to Part 2."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"An exiled warrior on a barren planet and niave farmer stand up to a tyrannical empire, along the way they find a morally ambiguous freighter pilot at a bar to leave the planet, then recruits several skilled warriors to help her stop the bad guy. It's a bad star wars/justice league mash-up that is far far from worth anyone's time.  Waste of a good cast."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The plot is very predictable and without any plot twist sadly.. a lot of cliches from other movies and sagas. Visually (excepting the presence of too many slow motions) is pretty cool, but I expected more without any doubt"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A mishmash of Magnificent 7, and other movies, never got any Star Wars vibe.   It was so good I fell asleep and my kids didnt know what to think of it.  Not very good at all"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good. Simple story with some interesting dialogues, very good special effects, spectacular photographs, great slow motion scenes and a great protagonist."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So bad, the constant slo mo cuts totally killed the flow of the movie. Plus there was no character development and it was just boring with no heart."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I don't think it deserved all the horrible reviews.
It ain't great but I found it entertaining and there are countless other shows that suck much, much more."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A test of the degree of imagination shown in a sci-fi film is whether it could equally have been done as a cowboy movie. ""Rebel Moon Pt. 1"" could have, and the movie would have been ""The Magnificent Seven"" (1960, 2016, 1998-2000 as a TV series, or indeed ""Seven Samurai"" of 1954), because the plot is err.... identical. And I expect the plot of the second half will be identical too. So if you have ever seen any of those and a spaceship taking off, you don't need to see this movie (OK, some of the spaceship imagery is very good). But I have to wonder whether anyone was actually paid for ""writing"" the script :-)"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was entertaining, with solid visuals."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not an original storyline, but still a fun watch. Visuals are amazing, still had me looking forward for part 2"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Genuinely enjoyed this film, and look forward to it's follow ups. Ignore the fussy critics shilling for Disney. This was originally meant to be a Star Wars story, but it's so much better than Disney ever would have let it be. Very good stuff, super enjoyable."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Poor, if any, character development. Unoriginal.
Cinematography a disaster. There are so many things going against this one i am surprised it made it out of the workshop in in the first place"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"pel√≠cula super interesante, recomiendo verla por las escenas que cautivan al publico"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,God it awful... God it's full of slow Mo's watch is at X2 speed!
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Although I liked the movie, story lines and special effects with a fresh take on a space opera. I am looking forward to seeing what becomes of the robot in the next movie. At the end of this movie I couldn't help but realize that this made me feel like I just watched a reboot of ""Battle Beyond the Stars"". The same feeling i got from watching the rebooted Dune. Disappointed and let down all over again. I will watch the sequels with the hopeless romantic belief that they will redeem themselves."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"La pel√≠cula es un sinsentido, con actores mal dirigidos, falta de emoci√≥n, a duras penas entretenida y con una utilizaci√≥n de la c√°mara que no deja olvidarte que lo √∫nico que est√°s viendo es un videoclip muy largo y muy caro."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Excelente pel√≠cula de acci√≥n as√≠ como me agrada las pel√≠culas
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Una pel√≠cula llena de acci√≥n emocionante y llena de drama
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent, I highly recommend it, take advantage of your free time and go see it."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Genial est√° pel√≠cula, la recomiendo sin miedo, muy buena trama y los actores ni se diga."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Excelente me gust√≥ demasiado se las recomiendo
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A very clich√© filled sci-fi movie.
Unfortunately, the story-telling is very fragmented and the film has difficulty retaining its audience.

You feel very annoyed by the lack of content and you feel you are missing parts of the story.

The film is beautifully made, but it cannot measure up to the poor narration style and the vast ocean of ‚Äã‚Äãclich√©s"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,A slow burn to try and build a story for parts 2 and 3. The directors cut will probably be alot better
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,this was just truly ass
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a basic recycled plot which works. Literally the same plot from Magnificent 7 but sci-fi. Lacks originality, but thats ok it's a fresh take on plots you already love. Visually it's great, but thats because Zac is a GOAT. Looking forward to the sequel in April."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,What a hodgepodge of stolen ideas with no cohesive story arc. Not sure how or why this was ever made. Kind of fun spectacle at times but really not worth your time.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As I watched ""Rebel Moon Part 1,"" I couldn't help but feel disappointed by what unfolded on the screen. The film, which promised an exciting sci-fi adventure, was marred by a series of critical flaws. Firstly, the script was a letdown, filled with clich√©s and lacking in meaningful character development. This made it hard for me to connect with or even care about the characters and their journey. Additionally, the pacing was painfully slow, with numerous scenes dragging on without adding anything significant to the story. Although the visual effects were technically impressive, they often felt excessive and seemed to compensate for the lack of a strong narrative. The performances, too, left much to be desired, failing to bring any real depth or nuance to the lackluster script. All these elements combined made ""Rebel Moon Part 1"" a forgettable and rather frustrating viewing experience, falling short of the captivating sci-fi epic it aimed to be."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excelente filme, recomendo a todos!"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is an objectively terrible movie. That said, it is a really fun drinking game movie. Get a group of family or friends and have a drink everytime you spot a scene, character or storyline ripped from another movie. If you know your sci-fi and fantasy movies you will be quite drunk by the end! 

I am frankly quite amazed a second instalment is imminent. The acting was very poor, the effects were ok (some effects were terrible), the characters were ridiculous, and the story line wholly unoriginal. As a new cast member came on screen, an Asian lady, we took bets on whether or not she was going to be a ninja. Sure enough, Asian lady is a ninja with lightsabers. 

Skip this movie, unless you watch it is a group for some drinking fun."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Great combination of different scifi and fantasy movies. Stunning scenes and awesome actors. I truly don't understand the negative reviews. I even registered to this site to let you know that you should definitely give this movie a chance. Can't wait for part II!
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed it. Obviously going to get comparisons to Star Wars. Not a massive Star Wars fan but enjoyed the style and gore(somewhat) that I always thought Star Wars should have. 
I will say the main character is pretty terrible, not a great cast whatsoever. Incredibly boring and she's genuinely just not a great actor. But would have rather have her than the a cringe John Boyega cutting about my screen. 
This film has been somewhat panned  from reading the reviews. If this film had Star Wars attached to its title, it would be clearing 4 out of 5s easily from most reviewers. Also, people love jump on a hate train,  Zack Synder is victim to this most of the time. Big man should change his name, and he'd be getting decent reviews. 
But aye, if you're reading this and you're on the fence, give it a bash. It's a good watch for sure."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was just bad all around. Overdone visuals with undercooked plots (plural, since this film shoved every trope into itself)."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,An Epic sci-fi journey!
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolute Star wars fanfic trash, Stupid slow mo scenes, no emotion robot actors and horribly boring and borrowed plot. Disney should sue Zack not because it's basically a Star wars ripoff, but because it sucks so bad."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Well I liked it. Its only a part one so there are going to be disfunction and questions unanswered but considering people get all excited about a Marvel movie (that has zero plot lines) I don't understand the hate for Rebel Moon. I look forward to Part two..
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I love these types of movies, but this Star Wars wanna be lacks time and depth into characters. Seems like they ran out of money and skipped over important notes from what I assume is the book. I will still watch the second movie!"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"33 minutes into movie and nothing grabs my attention. Boring, slow, cant get intimate the characters. Pass."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Thoughtless, mind numbing trash. It feels weird to say a movie both has way too much exposition and at the same time absolutely none. The viewer is spoon fed melodramatic flashback scenes of over delivered dialogue to establish the main character's tragic trope of a back story, while every other character is given a short segment of an over the top action sequence and some crumbs of dialogue. Only to take up arms and join the party without any meaning or reason, then getting shoved off screen, exit stage right.

Sci-fi fans will quickly realize that everything put on screen by the design department is something they've seen done before. From costumes that look directly ripped out of other franchises, to weapons so uninspired and unoriginal your brain will be convinced they pulled them off another set. 

Backgrounds often appear as flat, wide open poorly rendered cgi spaces that serve to remind your brain that nothing on screen is real, and none of this matters. The special effects look like mid 2000s video game cutscenes that seem intentionally blurred to hide the mistakes.

Nobody will be talking about this movie a month from now, and if there's any justice in the world this flop will serve as a reminder to future sci-fi writers and directors that if you want to start your own IP you have to be at least somewhat original."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Exactly the kind of movie I was looking for. Also well acted and visualized.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another excellent work from Zack, beautiful movie, great fight scenes üëèüèΩ üëèüèΩüëèüèΩ"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Vaguely entertaining but not good.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed this space-western-drama.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,It would have been better.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Even the best space operas are cheesy, and Rebel Moon isn't exempt from that fact. 

We watched this in a group, and it was very entertaining. Sure, it's a pile of tropes, but that doesn't make a bad film. What matters is that the parts were assembled in a way that entertains the audience, and Rebel Moon is a success in that way."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Poorly written conglomerate of the magnificent seven, dune, star wars, and any bad video game story of assembling your misfit crew of super badasses. It's s real stinker."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Dazzling images and effects but falls short of drawing viewer in. Poor character building that felt extremely rushed at times. Movie fell short of its potential due to poor dialogue and missed opportunities for character arc building.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Rebel Moon is a movie that follows the protagonist's point of view most of its time, all we know about the team is what she knows and we get to know some of her story and relate to her, knowing about the universe she lives in through her sights and story. The movie hints on some interesting points, like origins and behaviours of some characters that aren't digged in the part one, but maybe they will in the extended version or in part 2. The bad guys aren't dumb or miss all shots. There are some misteries to be delved into as well. I really enjoyed it and look forward to the extended cut of the movie that's supposed to come out before April 19th."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Silly over the top action flick masquerading as SciFi
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"What startwars should be, really good film, worth to give a try"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie, its not perfect but its great fun and visually stunning"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,It really feels like a chatGPT (poorly) written parody of Star Wars or any generic sci-fi movie. What a waste
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Poorly written and just a copy of the magnificent 7 , accents and acting isn't great, although visually stunning. Genuinely disappointed"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst movie I've seen in my life.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked the movie, can't wait for the next part"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,I usually really like Zack Snyders stuff but this sucked so bad!
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Action looked cool but other then that everything else was horrible
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Honestly dreadful. Charlie hunnams terrible accent is only a highlight as it adds a comedy aspect to this otherwise abysmal film

Character design: 1\10 (everyone is a cliche)
Character development: 0\10 (there isn't any)
Dialogue: 1\10 (reads like an angsty 14yo)
Plot: 1\10 (trope after trope after trope)
Choreography: 1\10 (clunky fight scenes)
Cinematography: 1\10 (nothing but CGI)


One of the worst films I've sat through, dialogue sounds forced and every phrase is done 'tough-guy' speech. This film relies on green screens and slow motion fight scenes to make up for it's lack of everything else like the cloying absent father who tries to buy your affection with expensive toys"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I don't know how you rip every part of your movie from so many great pieces of media and somehow not one minute of your runtime is engaging or interesting. The characters have no depth, and their motivations don't make any sense. The characters also weirdly never interact.  The aesthetic is a cheap knock off of Star Wars and Warhammer 40K.  It's an insult to your intelligence from title card to credits."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good space opera, looking forward to the sequel."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If you are looking for a visually good entretaining movie, this is for you. But, if you are looking for a good story with deep meaningfull characters and their development or motivations, you should look elsewere. Characters suddently join a rebellion because it's ""the right thing"", none of the characters besides the protagonist have any background story or motivations and they feel like they are inserted in the movie for the sake of the story. Feels like an expensive (worst) copy of star wars and serenity."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very entertaining, visually stunning. You can tell the world is rich in lore and a lot of thought went into it. Cgi is excellent (83m budget!!!) and by far outshines any blockbuster from recent years. Set up for the sequel at the end left you wanting more."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not his best. But I enjoyed it. The camera work... The story. I wished it was longer to complete the story. Can wait for part 2.

People can appreciate movies any more. There is this sickness where we only see what is wrong."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is a welcome addition to sci-fi lovers.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"hello
well i liked the movie
It is really a Warhammer 40 K meets Starwars take on the 7 samurai.
The cast is good, the plot is good for the genre. This movie does not suffer of the modern plague that is characters being used a plot device.  

A fair amount of people complain about characterisation but for me it is on par with the first part of the 7 samurai (which is 207 minutes long in the Japanese version). On that front ultimately the next instalment is going to be mesure of that point. They have hinted enough through each characters to  make  me quietly confident on that front.
Phil"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Star Wars from wish! 
Bad acting, cgi is ok, script is shocking! 

Count how many movie rip offs you can spot, it's not a hard challenge either."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Place 100g of Star Wars, 25g of Avatar, 15g of Lord of the Rings in the food processor. Knead in slow motion, very slowly, even more slowly. Now you will have mediocre food."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't understand the bad reviews. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time and in a genre where it can be hard to find originality. It was a fun ride all the way through. Highly recommend.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just boring and couldn't care less about any of the characters.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Everything about this movie is pompous and stupid. It's a waste of your time.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,Definitely worth watching at least once. Looking forward to seeing part two.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a great movie, sci fi adventures  like old times with enjoyable characters, some of the treacherous some of them noble with enough deepness that make me wait for the next movie.
And the robots fucking robots!!"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Film compl√®tement nul, j'ai perdu 2h15 de ma vie a regarder un film aussi vide au niveau sc√©nario que visuellement moche... Ils peuvent ne pas sortir la partie, √ßa fera gagn√© du temps aux gens"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,There is nothing new in the story line but the filmography is very good and you can see where the money has been spent.  At a guess I reckon good will win over evil by just enough to perhaps have a part 3 and 4.  Looking forward to watching episode 2.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,It is visually great! Can't wait for part 2. Love Sophia Boutella
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The story is soliciting and acting very mediocre. The lines the actors were saying were also very ""scripted"" and not how you would expect normal people to speak."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The effects are great!  However, that is all to this movie.  The story is meh, with no character development, and I found it to be derivative at best.  It is such a shame because the universe looks like it could be really fun to explore :("
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I can't understand the low ratings for this movie, it was great!! If you're a fan of scifi and action, then this is a must watch."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,I think as part one of the series it is a good start. I don't know why people think it was a waste of time. Yeah somethings were not upto the mark but even marvel movies have some illogical stuff and bad dialogues but people tend to ignore that. I think it is a good start and a spectacular visually
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,I give this a half star for its visual effects budget. Everything else about this is so incredibly derivative that I think the only way It could be any more derivative would be if it in fact straight up copied itself. I have a feeling that's exactly what the other 3 movies will do.. wait theres 3 more of these? OH GOD slay me now!!
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved that movie and can't wait for the second part. I just love the strong visual language of the director and other than light saber like weapons it disn't feel like Star Wars. Once again this is one of the examples where I clearly have the impression that critics (that do it as a job) are more wrong than right and that they are just unnecessary for the audience.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't believe the critics, it was a couple hours of escapist sci-fi fun, totally full of plenty of sci-fi tropes, but who cares, so are every other blockbuster, think ""7 Samurai""."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"don't listen to the complaints its a good movie, it's not perfect but it is good"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"A lot of fun, great imagination"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is such a shameless movie, waste of time."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"A disclaimer. My general mode of watching a movie or tv show is all about my entertainment. I do not fancy myself as a wanna-be critic and I don't spend the majority of my viewing time critically dissecting the plot line, the acting or finding a reason to punish the director for some past sin or disappointment.  Having set that as my viewing criteria I will say this movie entertained me. There was plenty of action and the universal design pleased my science fiction sensibilities.  Yes, the plot line had a familiarity to it but I enjoyed it just the same. I had no expectations for a more provocative level of sex or violence so I had no disappointment there. I will endeavor to watch part 2 when it comes out."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Lo mejor del cine de ciencia ficcion, CGI, trama, excelentes personajes, esto es lo que jamas tendra Star Wars actualmente, con ansias de la 2da parte."

"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Honestly. There are so many slow mo action scenes that show nothing, you wonder why it's slow mo in the first place.
The characters are forgettable.  I can't even remember the names of them. Half the movie is them teleporting to places(because of lack of transition) to gather random people when we don't even know why they want then to join. Nothing in the movie makes any sense. The characters pick the absolute dumbest options possible. Please hire writers the story/plot/dialog all suck."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"""Rebel Moon"" falls short of expectations, showcasing a convoluted plot and disjointed storytelling. The choppy dialogue and overuse of slow-motion scenes are noticeable, giving the impression of an attempt to compensate for a lack of substance. Unfortunately, these elements prevent the space saga from fully engaging its audience, resulting in a film that fails to deliver a satisfying and cohesive experience."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,I don't know why it's getting so much hate. Go in with no expectations and accept it for what it is - an easy popcorn flick.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's like Star Wars meets terminator with a splash of avengers. 
Not my favorite. We've seen stuff like this. Didn't really offer anything fresh. 

The evil character we think gets killed only to be revived by a big ""emperor"" boss.   I mean it's Star Wars episode 3. 

Just didn't do it for me. But I will still check out part 2."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolute rubbish, watch Battle Beyond the Stars. Then relax.."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Est√° buena para cuando no puedes dormir. 10 minutos y estar√°s roncando.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Straight forward story with great acting and good CGI you can really see the Star Wars inspiration, can't wait to see part 2!"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was entertaining. It is similar to other SciFi movies but it's story is different enough to enjoy and look forward to the next chapter.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie felt cheaply done. Acting felt really disconnected and felt like a bootleg version or starwars. Which is cool if you don't set your expectations to high. I would recommend putting your time elsewhere.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's not terrible. It's better than watching paint dry. It's like a really bad parody of Star Wars, 300, and Harlock: Space Pirate thrown together with Riddick, in a big tangled mess."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Full of plot holes, awful dialogue and boring characters. Will not watch the second one huge waste of time"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Trash movie with a big budget
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely fun film, stunning environments, so much potential, and definitely better than what Disney has given us over the past few years. Looking forward to part 2."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than any Marvel/Disney product in recent years. Thoroughly enjoyed it‚Ä¶.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Great start to a new franchise. Loved the introduction to this new world and really looking forward to the next chapter.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Awful, the production ""quality"" and CGI were horrible. The characters were over the top and melodramatic. Pretty much a waste of 2 hours. Grade D- SciFi."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked it a lot, I loved the characters, even though it has references to other... But it is VERY GOOD and the critics themselves instead of comparing it with StarWars should make a movie to see if it is ""better"" for them."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Incomprehensible rubbish, poor acting and woefully shot. Just avoid"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed this -
Seeing something new rather than a sequel. Interesting to learn about a new universe, and watch the character building. Good mix of action and exposition‚Ä¶ no boring parts."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"At the very end picks up and leaves a good taste, but the similarities with another sagas it's way too distracting."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Borderline unwatchable‚Ä¶
This is for sure a studio tax write off."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Sick special effects, a bit slow ‚Ä¶ feels like a poor man's guardians of the galaxy had a baby with a really poor man's Star Wars"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think this is a solid movie, I really enjoyed it. Don't know why ZS is hated so much by the media and rotten tomatoes. I enjoyed all this movies and this one is no exemption, can't wait for PT 2."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was a mish-mash of ideas and cliches. Stakes never felt high. Good cinematography. Maybe if they made it rated R it would've been decent.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visually this movie was a smorgasbord of awesome that was only interrupted by the absolute horror show that is its writing. Seriously. The plot and dialogue of this film would have been better written by a fifth grader actively overdosed on Adderall. It's sci fi for idiots. Turn the volume down and enjoy the landscapes and creatures by all means, but if you expect to get something more out of this, maybe consider not watching it."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visualmente me pareci√≥ bien lograda, buena fotograf√≠a y arte en general, grandes escenas de acci√≥n con lo mejor ya al final. No es la m√°s original ni la mejor pel√≠cula de Snaider, pero entretiene sin tanto rebuscamiento, la puedo ver otra vez sin problema. Soy nuevo en la p√°gina pero soy honesto y quiero seguir opinando de otras pel√≠culas."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Watched expecting a cool new sci fi that would leave me wanting more. Instead I got an Indie movie with c list actors, bad CGI, terrible writing, and kindergarten action scenes. Save yourself the watch"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie can only be reviewed with a pros and cons list as the polarity of what was good and what was bad was so dramatic, I feel the need to break it up. 

Pros:
*The graphic design of this movie is unbelievably good! Whomever designed the worlds and graphically created them, did one of the best jobs I have ever seen. The work they did into making the worlds feel so realistic were phenomenal, I was beyond impressed. This maybe some of the best imagery I have ever seen in a movie ever. +10 Stars
*The movie soundtrack has a very well balanced epic nature to it and felt very dramatic, but still felt smoothly placed along the different scenes of the movie. 
+4 Stars

Cons:

*The main female actress was not good, her acting was atrocious. What really ruined it for me is that it is an action movie. It was abundantly obvious that she had zero athletic ability, even her ""run"" looked non athletic. It was weird and made it very hard to take her serious in the action scenes. Triple camera angles bouncing around and slow motion scenes for days to make up for her inability to do any real action choreography. Also, this actress is like 90lbs. I very much doubt shes able to do any hand to hand combat yet they kept putting her in scenes where she is........ 
-5 stars
* Plot armor......more plot armor....and.....well more plot armor. I am convinced that a 10 year old wrote this plot line. It just does not have one real piece of developed plot. It was beyond cliche, there were no surprises, everything was obvious, and half the time the plot made no sense. The ""collecting"" warriors montage was so dumb....I almost turned the movie off on the ""gryphon scene"". I love gryphons, but there was no need to add this part to the movie other than to attract that small portion of sub 80 IQ viewers.
-5 Stars
*Acting. Almost every major actor in the movie, besides the main actress who is horrible, are usually really good actors/actresses. It hurt my heart to see some of my most favorite actors and actresses going through the motions as they participated in this horrendously bad movie. You could feel that they just were not in it. I recognize I know next to nothing about directing a movie, and at this point I am 100% certain I could make a better film. This is absolutely painful to watch. 
-5 Stars

Conclusion:
This movie is absolutely horrible. What makes this movie even more terrible is the fact that the creators of the imagery and music did a beyond well done job, only to have all their hard work just flushed right down the toilet with terrible writing/directing. This movie had some amazing potential and could have rocked the socks off of any viewer, but the never ending plot holes, the terrible acting, the unrealistic and mediocre main protoganist, the sidelined better actors/actresses, and the cliche ending were absolutely deflating. The producers/writers/directors should be ashamed of themselves."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a good flick. I'm not sure where all the negative comments are coming from, but I started the film with an open mind and found out it's good."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Plot is all over the place of mashed up other movie plots. Character development was rushed I guess the plot holes are meant to be discovered later but I really never got invested enough to care. Visually impressive scenes is all it gots but I'd be more entertained googling cool space scenes.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Garbage. Underdeveloped characters. Terrible acting. Nonsense story, riddled with plot holes."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The negative reviews are a little too harsh. This feels like your average sci fi these days. Nothing too original, great cinematic flair, and yeah, pretty average."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Definitely a great watch...Yes the story building was a little slow but there's gotta be a back story to give all the additional characters life and substance..VERY excited to see the second one..
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,It's better than anything Marvel has put out since Spider-Man: No Way Home.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,The awful acting and cringeworthy script could not be saved by the wonderful special effects. I can usually watch any sci-fi happily: this was a massive let down.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I appreciate all the detail to the lore of the entire movie, just finished it now and already want to watch it again. I would have gave it 5 stars if it were rated R but other than that it was really good!"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to what the critics have to say, see it for yourself. It's like some of the movies in the past couple years they raved that they were great but they just sucked so bad. Rebel moon is what the Star Wars sequels should have been. Instead we got stuck with Rey Skywalker and some how he returned. In Rebel moon, the visual effects are awesome, the script and story telling is well written and executed, perfect cast that blends well. Overall great movie and screw the haters."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a great popcorn movie. While it would never be confused with a film, it did feel like a well made video game. What it lacked in dialogue and plot it made up for with great visuals, a fun style and high quality production."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If you enjoy ridiculous amounts of slo-mo, one of the worst accents in movie history, and a thinly veiled it to bring people together, this may be the movie for you. I fell asleep twice, even when I just started using it as background noise."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was good. I'm looking forward to the next one.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I know a lot of people didn't like it, but I found it enjoyable. A lot of characters blended together. The characters are not stereotypes like many others today. And it is a cool new universe."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Give the main character some acting lessons, and maybe we can give this movie 2 stars?"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Did not live up to the hype, plot was dull, would not recommend"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie. Very good actions scenes.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Brother‚Ä¶ this was booty.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,me pareci√≥ una excelente pelicula !
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The first 35 minutes of the movie begins with a decent plot, a group of vulnerable colonists are threatened by a military force. They must give up their crops or die. The characters and dialog were compelling and it seemed to be the start of a decent movie. However, from there the story devolved into a shamockery of the worst kind. The hero assembles a group of tough guy (and gal) fighters, painfully one at a time, to save the colonists. Each new fighter is more simple, over the top, and under-developed than the last. The script quicly becomes a total effortless joke. The move stumbles incoherently from one scene to the next as it assembles a league of extrodinary goofs. The final fight sequence is so hard to believe and painful to watch that I had to fast forward thru it or risk vomitting. This movie is an insult to sci-fi fans."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If the story would move past looking for fighters for a war, it might have been a bit better. It passed the time, not in a hurry to see Part 2"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't get all the hate. Solid cast, easy to understand what the core elements are. Look forward to part 2."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visually appealing at times, but plot is simple and the characters even simpler. There is no depth to the story as each character joins the fight with little to no convincing preventing the viewer of any immersion. This felt like more of a limited series than a feature film."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,My family and I absolutely loved this movie. I personally watched it 3 times already. I cannot wait for part 2 to come out. Zac has outdone himself with this one. Graphics and storyline was great.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was absolutely AMAZING! A must watch Snyders movie making is something of impeccable. The way he captivates and captures everything is really outstanding 1000000000/10
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was a very fun watch. Visually stunning,lots of action likable characters. I can't wait for the second installment. It felt like an adult StarvWars. I hear there's a R rated version coming soon. If you ignore the critics and just watch the movie,I believe you will have a good time. Didn't feel like a 2 hour movie to me."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was pretty to watch some parts, but the CGI was horrible, the storyline was not smooth at all.  It seems liked a ton of backstory was just skipped over but then referenced later in the movie.  I had to rewind parts of it because I thought I must have dozed off and missed important things, but they just skipped them apparently.  I had no idea how they got to some places and found some of the characters."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"The film borrows from movies like 7 Samursi. Dirty Dozen, A Bugs Life, OG Star Wars, and a little of LOTR but that is not a bad thing.  This movie has a lot of action and is better that Disney Star Wars. 3.5 starts out of 5."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Was like watching a Cliff Notes movie about a bunch of old Star Wars movies
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's AWESOME!! Yes, it's yet another remake of 7 samurais. But I don't care! I like that story and am fine that it's a basis of so many other stories. Yes, it's a bit too much backstory and world building can be a bit slow. I just hope part 2 carries enough momentum to make the backstories worthwhile for MANY future tales... I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, it's visually stunning, the characters are cool and I LOVE this kind of Sci Fi and support this endeavor!"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,Decent movie but it's convoluted and I hate the mains voice.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Slow motion for me has a brand new meaning. This was a chose to watch and somehow might be Snyder's worst work yet and that's saying something as he beat up Superman with a kitchen sink.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"My wife and I thought it was great. Lots of action and stunning visuals. 

Cast was perfect. Character development a bit slim. 

Overall, we'll worth our time watching. We are looking forward to the next part."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Let's forget about the low budget ""Harry Potter scene"" with the hippogriff‚Ä¶ü´† Everything else is very good! People just need to stop to be annoying and enjoy things!"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Insipid mess. 
Story is thin but worse is the poor character development - all tropes and clich√©s. 
Most of the visuals and sci-fi elements are copy/pasted from other films (there's even a hippogriff from Harry Potter)."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Historia muy gastada, efectos especiales muy pobres"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,So many negative ratings. My friends and I absolutely loved it! Can‚Äôt wait for future movies! Would be cool to watch on the big screen!
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Decent start. Can't wait for part two.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was awesome. Don't understand the bad reviews.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome scify action and a great retelling of the 7 Samurai.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"As a hater of Disney Star Wars and the majority of marvel films I can honestly say that this film was good not a masterpiece but very good . If this was set in the Star Wars universe like it was created for it would be pretty epic Disney missed out on this and are stuck with the trash they churn out . Some decent twists and character development is swift and satisfying enough to get the story moving . Some people might prefer a tv series to introduce the side characters in more depth but I would rather it be like how this film did it and make me want to find out more about them later if the film succeeds in keeping my attention . 
I'm looking forward to the sequel and at this point I'm invested in this project . Can't believe a lot of people are bad mouthing this film i almost didn't check it out cause of it but I'm glad I did ."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the movie. Great character development, action and special effects. Can't wait for pert 2!!!"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Me and my family watched on Christmas night and half left and the other half fell asleep. If it wasn't for the slow motion this movie would be like an hour and half instead of the two and half hours it is. The characters and writing is so bad and has so many references to other science fiction (Star Wars and Warhammer) It feels like a B movie with good visuals and the visuals are the only reason why its getting a 2 instead of a 1.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Wow‚Ä¶ that was just terrible. Nothing redeemable about this hunk of junk. If I could give no stars I would.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I never reviewed a movie in my life. Yet I compelled to do this. I'm 40 and generally love sci fi movies. Having said that, there is one thing I can say that is extremely positive about this film. It's consistently horrible for the entire 2 hours. So if you are 15 minutes in and are thinking, man this is garbage, it probably gets better, don't, because it doesn't. If you pay attention to the clues, the film makes it very clear that it's terrible and gives plenty of clues to stop watching it. Listen to yourself. Or you can spend 2 hours of your time hoping this eventually gets better until the credits start rolling and you find yourself disappointed by your optimism"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm not huge into sci-fi but thought it was entertaining, excellent fight scenes, and had great visuals.  I would definitely watch the next one.  A lot of people are crapping on this movie because it is similar to other sci-fi movies.  If you aren't obsessed with Star Wars you will enjoy this movie.  Almost no movies in 2023 are all original ideas anymore. . .so try not to take things so seriously and enjoy it for what it is."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a great movie. Not many are coming out like this!!!
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,i hope the directors cut version plugs the gaps in the storyline - the edit in this version makes episode one painful to digest.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This film stands as a profound disappointment, a stark contrast to the expectations set by its promising premise. It's plagued by a multitude of shortcomings, the most glaring of which is its poorly structured plot. The storyline meanders without clear direction, leaving the audience bewildered and disengaged. The script is another weak point, filled with dialogue that feels artificial and forced, further detracting from the movie's potential to resonate with its viewers.

In terms of performances, the actors seem to struggle, unable to breathe life into their one-dimensional characters. This lack of depth in character development results in a failure to evoke any emotional investment from the audience. The interactions between characters feel stilted and unnatural, exacerbating the film's overall lack of cohesion.

Furthermore, the direction of the movie is lackluster. It's evident that there's a missing sense of vision or creative flair, which leaves the film feeling uninspired and tedious. This is compounded by the subpar cinematography and special effects, which are neither innovative nor particularly well-executed. Instead of enhancing the storytelling, they feel like afterthoughts, failing to add any real excitement or visual appeal.

Even the soundtrack, which often serves as a redeeming feature in many films, is unremarkable and forgettable in this case. It neither complements the scenes nor adds any additional layers to the narrative.

Overall, the movie is a significant letdown. It fails to deliver on many fronts, from storytelling and character development to technical aspects like cinematography and special effects. The end result is a film that is not only unsatisfying but also forgettable, lacking the elements necessary to make it a worthwhile cinematic experience."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I watched Rebel Moon, so you don't have to. The plot is a mess of scenes copied and pasted from other sci-fi. There's a noticeable lack of any character development or motivation. Action scenes are so-so, and some of the production design is nice."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Im a sucker for all thing SciFi. Loved it.  Can't wait for book 2
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Stunning visuals, the potential for this series is strong. Story was a bit lacking but was enjoyable either way. I am keen for what they have to offer next in its 2nd instalment."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Aside from some really cool visuals here and there, there just isn't any meat on the bone.  Way too much slow mo, muted drab colors and uninteresting characters."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"An amazing cast, and some 'okay' CGI, and that's the highlights of this movie."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,I made it 4 minutes. Plowing a field in a tank top at night really triggered me for some reason.  I suppose I could have watched a few more minutes.  I'll never know.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Sure the plot has some holes but what movie doesn't.  This is an absolutely fantastic movie with amazing video effects and even better audio effects! Sound makes 50% of a movie and this was incredible.  An absolute must see and I'm certainly hoping this is the start of an even bigger universe!!
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Spoiler alert: This is my first ever review but I feel like I had to warn people. This is garbage with glitter on it. It is 2 hrs of no character development. Like at one point this sword lady kills something and all she says is ""remember this could be you dead in a field chasing revenge"" like it is supposed to mean anything to us. I dont know who you are lady. It made no sense. Then later all of a sudden the dude you totally knew was gonna be backstabbing, backstabbed but you didn't really care. Apparently this whole time there was some massive love happening between to characters. They literally had to say it because they never showed it. At that point I was low key rooting for a comet to just come out of no where and wipe out both sides. That would have been the real hero."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Made an account specifically to give this movie an awful rating - that's how bad it was. My favorite genres are sci-fi and fantasy, so this seemed like it'd be right up my alley. My fianc√© fell asleep, which was a better use of time honestly. It's like the writers set out to cram this movie with as many cliches as possible. The writing, acting, and directing were all atrocious."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a very good movie & I am looking forward to seeing more.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The visual elements are fantastic.  Based on this alone, Rebel Moon is worth the price of admission. However, the characterization and dialogue is fairly canned throughout. The story lacked a sufficient amount of exposition of the supportive characters, especially Tarak and General Titus. Overall, good - not great! I do recommend this film and will be ready for Part Two when it arrives."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm not even reading what the critics say because I want just my opinion out there. It was a fun new sifi film that we have not had in a hot while. To tired of the marvel hero trope, so this was a breath of fresh air and story telling"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"All style and no substance with the usual over the top characters, silly dialogue and over acting"
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Com certeza √© melhor que o Star Wars da era Disney.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Um filme √©pico, divertido que te prende na tela do in√≠cio ao fim, te faz criar uma conex√£o boa com os personagens, sem contar que as cenas de a√ß√£o s√£o maravilhosas, Rebel moon √© sem sobra de d√∫vidas uma das melhores produ√ß√µes do ano.
Estou super ansioso para a segunda parte."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Thank God for Fast Forward.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"You literally copied Chronicles of Riddick!   Even some of the dialogue and narration is the same.   
That's just lazy writing."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Solid entertainment. I'm no critic. Just a person who likes good movies. looking forward to part 2.
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"The film for me is good, a mix of Star Wars, I would give it from 0 to 10, I would give it about 6.5"
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,‚ÄúI like this movie it was good
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie had so much potential but ultimately fell flat. I'm optimistic for the sequel because it is an interesting world to create a compelling story in and all the pieces are there it just comes down to the actual story and the development of the characters. 

My primary issues are Kora's character development being done entirely in voice over flashbacks which messed up the pacing of the movie; the complete lack of characterization of everyone on the elite team they gathered; and the climax taking place at an unnamed undisclosed trade depot, which drastically reduced the stakes of protecting the farm planet the primary conflict was based around.

The biggest positive was Kai. The acting was spot on, the costume choice and props he had made him intriguing and I don't want to spoil anything but his twist had a good set up and payoff.

I hope the sequel is better because I really believe it can be good."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,I want the 2hs back...please! ü•∫ üò≠
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good sci-fi movie
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite what the critics say and some reviewers, this is an entertaining film and some of the best sci-fi genre is a while, with the possible exception of The Creator, which I felt was a great film.

I feel some are being premature and I will await the second installment for my final judgement."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Eye candy, a good story approaching."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"I recently watched ‚ÄòRebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire' with my family and we had a blast! The movie is visually stunning and action-packed, with a great cast of characters. I was particularly impressed by the film's epic scale and the way it kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for an exciting sci-fi adventure that the whole family can enjoy together.

Looking forward to part 2."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If I had to summarize this movie it would be riddick meets dune meets Star Wars. It was an okay film, some nice epic scenes here and there. The film could be better, I would have liked to see more character development instead there was a lot of characters quickly introduced to speed the story along. The villain needed more time to lead up to the part 2, I feel the film needed more of a figure head for the main villain especially with the ice scene at the end."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I watched it last night and enjoyed it quite a bit considering I wouldn't say I like Zack's other movies other than 300 and Suckerpunch.  Interesting characters and ideas but I also like how I kind of got lost in the movie and forgot about a lot of real-life concerns. Movies like that usually end up becoming long-time favorites for me.  I'm no critic as I don' have my own youtube channel, apparently, that's how you qualify. I enjoyed it more than overhyped Oppenheimer or stupidly overhyped and quite awful Barbie."
"Dec 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Way better than Disneys latest Star Wars Trilogy. Bit rushed but the story is there. Would be great to have seen what it would have looked like with Disneys budget.
"Dec 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Really disappointing mashup of Magnificent Seven/Seven Samurai with everything from Star Wars and Avatar to Firefly. No real script it seems, just an amalgamation of other movies' plotlines. Characters are wooden, plot twists are predictable. The closest thing I can compare it to is Jupiter Ascending or Sucker Punch although I'll say Jupiter Ascending was slightly more watchable..."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Well,... It's a movie I guess."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"At face value, it's an okay movie. Lots of celebs. Visually appealing. Good action. Bad side, this movie is very clich√©. Little character development. Overall, though, I was still entertained."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,chat gpt and midjourney have made a movie.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Parem de criticar, o filme √© bom e ponto"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I Loved it. Has bits and pieces of other influences but considering what I heard about the origins of the film that's no surprise. Cannot wait for part two.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,Although it felt like Netflixs version of star wars it was still decent. The action and character designs where incredible. I'm pretty excited to see part 2 and see there characters develop.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Seems like a poor man's star wars/dune rip-off. It's hard get past the first 30 min as it's so generic. The characters are one dimensional and lifeless. I don't know what all the hype is about
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it. Certainly comparable to Star Wars but with more potential.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is Shite, Rebel Moon had the potential to be great. But instead it's a big pile of garbage"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Another feminine delusional movie from Hollywood. When will this advertisement get off our screen by force?
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Knowing this is a first part to help build the world helps, would not have worked as a stand alone.  There were some great sequences and visuals.  However I was not a fan of the VFX, when it came to laser fights.  It looked very cheap.  I also would have liked a little more blood when it came to the fights.  It took away from the cool fight choreography."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excelente pelicula.
Muy entretenida."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The definition of ""meh it passed the time""."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I really wanted to like it. But this is beyond bad. Horrible in every sense, the tech, the creatures, the characters are uninteresting, generic, flat, annoying. More strong female space jesus, clich√© bad guys, no deep meaning. 
It is just a festival of VFX and a bunch of ideas copied from other movies all glued together without making any sense. 

Awful AF. Couldn't believe it can be worse than than SW: The return of Palpatine..."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing film.. role on part 2
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is full of action and pretty visuals. It does feel like a galaxy far far away. The plot is good as well the movie is well worth your views and time.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"All visuals, zero character or plot development.  So boring, it was like a sci-fi b-movie from the 1990s with better effects. Who asked for this?"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It never really did anything, I fell asleep for the first time ever watching a syfy. I normally love them all but this same as all the rest story just bored me to sleep"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Regardless of what genre it aspire for it's still less than mediocrity. The unspeakably bad outcome is made up by bad character writing and poor screenwriting that makes no sense even for the most ""epic"" comic stories."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ugh. Don't bother. So much potential so little substance.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is a boring movies the characters suck and the whole thing is just horrible.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,Decent space action film not super deep but maybe the directors cut will improve it. Either way its a fun watch
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"How did they get away with so many blatant plagiarised elements from so many different movie franchises? The hippogriff from Harry Potter, Queen of the Aracnos from Dr Who just 2 small examples and why oh why is Charlie Hunnam attempting a Northern Ireland accent with emphasis on the word attempting. Well acted, great effects and cinematography but all the time I was distracted by remembering which other film was being ripped off in virtually each scene and let's not forget the massive overuse of slow motion."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I truly had high hopes for this film and its sequel, but I am sad to say I was severely underwhelmed and disappointed by this attempt at a space opera of sorts.  First, the visuals, while elaborate and meant to be ""eye candy"" were ruined by poor decisions such as Zack Snyders continuous use of slow motion throughout the film. All the major battles/action packed moments were ruined by ridiculous slow motion cuts.  The characters were really hard to ""get to know"" and almost there to just create an ensemble of ""rebels"" yet you barely get to know anything about them. The movie was slow, yet jumped quickly from location to location in an effort to fit in as much as possible in the short window of time the movie was allotted.  Sadly, I went into this movie with zero idea of what it was about and was open to just enjoy another ""Star Wars"" like film and I hate to say how utterly disappointed I was.  There was basically nothing redeeming about this film and unfortunately it rewatchability is basically zero.  Not sure how part 2 can rescue the mess caused by one."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it.  Visually stunning beginning to what I hope is several movies to come!
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. Best I have seen in a long while. Can't wait for part 2
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,I tried to watch but film was repetitive of many other films.  Spent allot of money but nothing new
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If I was going to rate the visuals I would probably give it 5 stars, but the story is so bad, and that's the most important part for me watching a movie. Character backgrounds are close to zero, lack of character development, and the story is very predictable..."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Falaram t√£o mal do filme. Fui ver, gostei muito. Portanto: tenha sua pr√≥pria experi√™ncia!"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Me pareci√≥ muy aburrida y siento que vi el ep4 de Star ward, me decepcion√≥ completamente, cero originalidad."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,30 minutes in and the pacing went absolutely haywire. Plotlines went nowhere. Characters weren't fleshed out. Too much unexplained nonsense.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Unnecessary ando too much slow motions scenes, flares that can blind you, very weak story , poor characters a lot of fan service. Worth for the fun but that's it ‚Ä¶"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun movie with lots of twists and turns backed by solid performances and a great story.  It's like Serenity and Star Wars had a baby.  Enjoyed it enough to watch it again.  Fabulous soundtrack.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it, don't understand the poor reviews. Just a great action packed sci fi film."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was the first movie ever that I was looking forward to, watched it on the first night it was available, and shut it off half way through. Really bad ripoff of several overdone fantasy and sci-fi tropes and movies. It does look good while being terrible, though."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,A good solid movie with a good story line. I liked it
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought this was a fantastic pop corn movie. Feels like what cinema should be but sadly we don't get much of this anymore.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"magnificent 7 meets star wars,"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As a lot have already said, the movie is an utter mess of references not linked together by a compelling story. Fight choregraphy is awful, characters don't know what they are doing here. An utter disaster."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Charlie Hunnam was a breath of fresh air in a movie that was super predictable and basic.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Plagiarism, but not as good as anything it is plagiarising."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Es una pel√≠cula coral espectacular. Un festin vusual. El fandom a veces pide simpleza pero esta vez vale la pena lo complejo
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Poor story, lack of original ideas, second-hand univers, borrowed characters. Actors have nothing to play. Visual makers use a huge scene and tules for nothing original to show. Could anybody point one new or original idea, character, plot? All looks as AI production glued from slightly modified ideas from other shows, cartoons and games soaked in bombastic music. A good thing is that sometimes one have to watch a spoiled movie to be able to give a credit to a good one. Pity that producers would again deny the disaster to minimize loses and author be allowed to act a success. Definitely waist of resources that could have some better use."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"While watching the visually stunning images, I kept asking, ""What is this scene?"" The story structure and various character arcs are compartmentalized, with the leads standing around watching a side character fight a villain with no backstory. This movie's connective tissue suffers from the ""and then..."" syndrome with a lot of ""Why did that need to happen?"" and ""Who the fuck are these people?"""
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Although visually interesting and having a few nuggets that suggest a greater potential.  The film seems badly edited and most of the story is spent assembling a team of characters with little depth and really do nothing to warrant the effort to recruit them.  There is no time to develop any of the characters, the story feels tedious, and the ending is nonsensical.  If you like science fiction mostly for the eye candy and not the story, it may be worth the watch."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've seen redemptive stories before, but this style was a tad bit different. The action, the story, and the characters gravitated you closer to what was happening on the screen. I thought this was going to be something I could play on my phone while watching this movie. But I quickly found out I was missing out on important details. So I quickly put my foot down and locked in."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Takes derivative to a whole new level.  Visuals are phenomenal. Acting is adequate (mostly).  Action scenes were okay. Character backgrounds and overall story are among the worst I've seen in quite some time.  
This would have been a bad SciFi movie in the 70s."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Personally I really liked the movie.  It entertained me and I loved it visually.
The bad thing about the movie: I felt like things were missing from the plot, things happened very quickly.  A very fast pace that didn't let me enjoy it better."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Short on plot with stunted characters yet took a while to get going but looks great and I might watch the sequel to see how it all turns out.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Super movie! Will be waiting for second part !
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Clearly had the funding and the idea was there. How ever the script wasn't and was disappointingly predictable. The combat scenes were visually nice; if you can get past the fact whoever wrote it has no idea what they were doing. And let not mention the dodgy Tech-priests; or the fact here father trusted by the king, is the betrayer; really wasn't a surprise."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Meh...Meh...and more Meh. Was really going in looking for a good movie. What I got was a Syfi retelling of Magnificent Seven (or earlier Seven Samurai). Special effects are decent, but some of the mechanics are questionable. Character development was nothing but monologs, which never captures the hart of the watcher. There was at no point I really cared who lived or died. Even the surprise bad guy was not a surprise. Oh no!...meh...whatever. I really blame very poor, maybe rushed, writing and overall story arc. Will I watch the second part, probably, but with a lot less expectations."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not a critic, just a fan who thought it was awesome!"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was the combination of tropes from other movies in this space, mashed together into an uninteresting plot driven by unrelatable and uninteresting characters. In Rand-speak, it's the kind of movie Roark would have made if he compromised on his principles and designed buildings with Greek columns, porticos, and triglyphs, divorcing form from function."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was a horrendous movie. The first quarter was watchable, but the story-line quickly falls apart after that. The dialog is immature, the story is akin to the Nazi in a galaxy far, far away.  One of the best characters in the movie is killed. None of the other characters carry their weight. I loved Army Of The Dead and Army of Thieves, bit this trash was worse than Batman Versus Superman."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible Movie. So stereotypical , so awful cast, a waste of time"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Don't waste your time.  2+ hours of nonsense.  More slash-and-burn action than sci-fi.  Stale re-used tropes left and right, plenty of costumes that seemed taken from other movies, and loooootttssssss of slowwwwww motion (hey, it needs to fill air time to justify its supposed $160 million price tag).  Nothing new to see here.  I wish I could have given it a 0."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thoroughly enjoyed it. I felt it was a little short, even at 2hours 15minutes. I could have sat watching for another hour at least.  
What did spoil it a little was when the Admiral hit his teeth knocked out by Cora prior to falling over the edge. Then to have them all back in when they found him on the ground and more noticably when he awakened after being regenerated."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Rubbish. A weird mix of Star Wars, Terminator, Harry Potter, Lord Of the Rings and who else knows what else.
Same old plot as ever (nasty empire against sexy and smart rebels)
Oh and Charlie Hunnans' accent is vomitive. 
I won't watch the 2nd part."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Is like the game warhammer 40k.
A good popular movie, nothing especial."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know where the hate is coming from, but this is actually a good movie."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,I was actually a little lost in the plot...acting was alright but the post production aspects seemed to have pieced the movie together oddly.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I‚Äôve waited for these world building sci fi epics my whole life. Now they‚Äôre here and they‚Äôre glorious!
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Great visuals! Great Story! Similar in a way to the way Joseph Campbell influenced Star Wars. Great Sci Fi!
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Muy exelente perseverante
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,This was simply bad.  Cringe from scene 1
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's getting one star because visually it looks great, and Ed Skrein does what he can, but the story is terrible, characters are indistinguishable from each other, and most of the film is a montage. Just rotten."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Slow and boring, felt like a cheap star wars copy."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Remember it's only the FIRST part. If there's something you're missing it'll probably be in the second part, it won't win any awards but it's still an enjoyable ride. 
And it's obvious a point that this Part ONE would focus on the main BIG character Kora aka Artelais aka The Scargiver.

It's a good start to something bigger, it just needs time to build on it in the future. Can't wait for Part two April 19 2024 and the extended cuts coming soon... "
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,I thought it was boring.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,People keep complaining about this but honestly it's just a good action sci-fi with some really cool fantasy elements blended in.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,A unique take on sci-fi truly captivating and intriguing
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,classic Zac‚Ä¶7 Samurai in space with lots off slow motion. Not bad like so many critics seem to say!
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"A quien nos gusta la ciencia ficci√≥n, y la sangre, buena trama"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Overall it's a good watch. Looking forward to seeing the director's cut
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Are there any words other than ""worst film ever"" for this movie?"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a good movie, I enjoyed the story , and the characters, but, I think the movie should to elaborate more the introduction of each character, I feel the movie is short accordingly to the complexity of the story."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"""ChatGPT, write me a script composed of clich√©s, but first, imagine yourself as a stupidest neural network whose database consists only of descriptions of three movies. Pretend you were told to envision yourself as a novice, struggling scriptwriter."""
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A movie that was 30% substance 70% VFX. An ensamble reminiscent of Star Wars, Lord of The Rings, and Dune with about half the heart. 

The movie has beautiful environments that weren't explored with the characters being the same. Poor back stories and a rushed premise give a lack luster feeling leaving you with wanting more in a ""half satisfied way"". 
This movie was hoping to capture hearts through visuals only to flood the screen with them. The plot, villains, and supporting cast were all a copy paste of pre-existing universes just with extra steps. The movie feels like another expensive flop where unhinged, coked up producers wanted to shove something down our throat with the monomer of ""Biggest Movie of the Year"". When can we get another movie that loves us? When can we get that fluttering feeling similar to that of Harry bidding farewell to his son, Luke saving the galaxy, or Frodo growing old? Where is the sense of a long adventure coming to an end where you crave no more. Where our story telling appetite has been satiated? 

The movie was visually amazing- stunning? No. Thrilling? Also no. But if you're looking for a movie that will make you reach the bottom of the popcorn bucket, get up off your seat and get a refill mid movie, this is it. Startle up for a modern time B movie with a larger budget than it deserved. Trending the flops of 2023 this movie will leave you not wanting more of it. Part 2 in April 2024? Yeah, I'll leave that one in the queue for a while."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,The critics were a little harsh on the movie. It was entertaining. Some similarities from previous Synder work. Could not of been better definitely but that's what the directors cut will prove. Overall a great start to a franchise that definitely needs the R rated version to really showcase the movie.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,is a good movie. cool.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked the film, its story is perfect, well-constructed characters, fascinating settings, a mix of science fiction and fantasy. Unfortunately, they had time to develop the story further, but they made it too long."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not very original relative to the Star Wars, Dune, and Blade Runner arcs but overall very enjoyable. It's better than all the remakes and social statements..."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"As cenas de lutas e combate foram muito boas, bem caracter√≠sticas do diretor. Eu vi profundidade nos personagens, e a imers√£o nesse mundo novo foi muito boa. Entretanto, o filme muito escuro, tamb√©m caracter√≠stico do diretor, atrapalha um pouco."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I saw a lot of critics say that this film is a Star Wars knock off. While that is true, for example, the introduction explaining what we are about to watch is a 100 percent Star Wars carbon copy. Rebel Moon also plagiarizes other popular blockbuster franchices such as the MCU. Kora was taken in by the Regent and raised as his own after he destroyed her entire village. Have we seen that before in the MCU? Let's remember that Thanos destroyed Gamora's village, but sparred her and raised her as his own. She then turned on him by joining The Guardians. Similarly in Rebel Moon, Kora betrayed the Regent. You see two more instances of this regurgitated in the MCU. Loki turned on the King of Asgard & Captain Marvel fighting against the Kree."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm amazed by the bad ratings for this film it's entertaining, original ok it borrows from other movies, but what film doesn't these days. It's the film the Star Wars sequels should have been it a must see for me"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining movie.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I quite enjoyed it. Action was great, world building was good. I want to see more of this world. Many people are claiming ""lack of originality,"" but don't most movies follow some classic tropes? Felt like a classic ‚Äòassemble the team and fight the big bad evil' story. It's not breaking any new ground nor is it painfully derivative to the point of being dull. It was a great time and I look forward to the director's cut and part 2. 
Only complaint is it is a bit exposition heavy and a few of the special effects shots looked cheap"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Same old formula with wooden characters.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Rebel Moon is entertaining but it has its flaws. It has some some good action and cinematography. But it would have been a much better movie if it was R-rated not PG-13. I heard that there is a directors cut of R-rated version will be released. I m really excited to see that version of the movie. Hopefully Part 2 would me much stronger and better film.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Is there any sci fi movie made in the last decade that this didn't rip off? It felt like a combination of a music video cutting together scenes from other, better, films and what a bunch of kids would play at in the playground."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Ignore those telling you not to like this film. It's a fun Space Opra that let's the world melt away while it's on.  Enjoy it.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Good job Star Wars not including this. Why was this made?
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Wish it were longer. I'm sure the directors cut will be phenomenal.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Wonderful fantasy sci-fi adventure. Well acted and engaging with great special effects and action. We were very entertained!
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,I fell asleep several times while watching the movie it's that boring
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Pretentious and tedious.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Watched Friday and I thought it was absolutely horrible but honestly it isn't nearly as bad as I thought on the initial run. It is still pretty directly derivative of every sci-fi movie ever made; to the point it almost feels like a satirical spoof in spots, and Zack doesn't seem to know how to give emotional attachment to his characters, humorless and not a ton of heart. That said, i thought about it enough to watch it again today so there has to be some entertainment value in that so 2 stars."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,The story itself may not be wholly original but what is these days? At least it's not a re-make / reboot. Entertaining.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Characters weren't interesting at all given the potential to introduce space warriors with special skills. They just stood on the sideline and shot lasers in slow mo. Acting was sub par and pg13 rating hurt the action with boring fights.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Between the super slow motion, the lack of characterization of characters and poorly written story; I was very disappointed. I don't know what this movie was trying to be. The muddy color palate, the weird exposition dumps, the blurriness. I don't even remember most of the characters names or why they were along for the ride. I hated this movie and I really wanted to love it when I saw the trailers. I'm a Synder fan and I loved his Justice League and BVS, but Rebel Moon wasn't good at all."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A rehash of multiple other, more successful Sci-Fi stories and franchises with very little original content. What was delivered was not good nor interesting aside of some expensive CGI and effects, watched in full as too lazy to move, but regret not reaching for the remote"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very very very bad‚Ä¶ trash
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love it!! Great Movie, interesting Characters, can't wait for part 2!!"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoy the film just with the was more character development, we was just introduced to character after character which didn't seem like they where really needed"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved this movie!  Critics have renewed my lack of faith in their opinions and I cannot wait for the second part to come out!
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought this movie was fine.  Not the greatest, not the worst."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it. Great cast/characters. Story line good, excellent battles/fighting along with some emotional scenes. Can't wait for part 2"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining. Loved it.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoy how it combines all of the best of various sci-fi and wild west movies!
Tons action and various characters with different stories to attach to. Will be a huge franchise in years to come!"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The 5 star ratings are probably pay to review. I've seen other reviews stating ""bad fan fiction"" but that's being kind. This is dog ____. I love sci-fi and have my entire life and I couldn't stand this cliche driven trash pulled from every other sci-fi move and series for the past 40 years. The premise is dumb. The guy who tames the big crow by just talking to it, inane. The opening scene, plowing a field, at night, with a hand drawn plow with a huge Saturn planet looming overhead is visually interesting, but denies science on the scale of a flat-earther.

Save yourself 2 1/2 hours and just don't. I want my 2 1/2 hours back."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,LotR meets Dune. Nice effects. Story is ok.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Brutal plot, script and mish mash of scenery trying to create a cohesive story.  Not intellectually believeable in any way enough to take it seriously.  Even as a make believe ""fun action"" flick it barely functions"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,It wasn't perfect but it was very entertaining
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Thoroughly enjoyable. Lots of action. It starts off kind of slow but picks up the pace pretty quickly. Great potential for one or more sequels.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,The over use of slow motion action was too much for me that i couldnt focus on any other aspect of this film.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great action, great music, great special and make up effects, and of course very cinematic. Eagerly awaiting the R-Rated version! The movie delivers what was expected, so I can't see why this isn't rated higher. Anyways, always see for yourself.."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing, and well done it"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,What a hot mess. From space vagina to Harry riding the hippogriff. From Dune to Shelob attacking one of the Seven Samurai. How did multiple episodes of this cringe get green lit?
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"An awesome new universe, can‚Äôt wait for part two "
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Es un maravilloso comienzo
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,How many times can a studio make the mistake of announcing two parts to a film before the first part comes out? Will anyone ever learn from this?!
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Almost unwatchable. You'll pause and consider not finishing. Then you'll continue  hoping it will somehow improve. It doesn't. Many many better movies around right now.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Horrendous! The story line is highly predictable but worse yet is the murderous attempt at an Irish accent by Charlie Hunnam, why, why why!!! I'd give this movie a complete miss."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was an entertaining film. It was exactly what i was expecting and would have loved to have seen this as a Star Wars film. I can see where some of this was going. Is this a deep movie, no, but damn it was fun.  This was a meant to be a popcorn film, sit down and just enjoy the ride."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. Can't wait for part 2!
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was really excited about Rebel Moon, but it's a soulless hodgepodge sci-fi mess. Visuals & character designs are super creative, but there's nothing to connect to. There's no lore of the universe other than an opening exposition dump & the characters are just there. Bummer."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,There are to many scenes which are totally unnecessary. I fast forward few times cause it definitely gets boring.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very boring star wars reject, do not put yourself through this  it is painfull. The character appear to be clones of any other movies with no skills or purpose. You do not care for them, when one dies, o well is the the response. yes this is a modern movie god it is bad."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie. Ignore the reviews.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This film copied several other franchises, made them dull, and stuck them together with dollar-store duct tape. I cared nothing for any of the characters, who were predictable and themselves boring."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Pretty but bad(that's it).
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Found it hard to find its feet and the constant switching of camera and scenes helped the feeling of disconnect with the characters. Felt like an explanation before an actual movie came out.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Well... It's not Zack's best work, but the references he used get me. I liked, and if you enjoy some Star Wars with no Disney filter what so ever,  you will liked too."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Wait to see more...
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was a terrible movie. The story was abysmal, the action laughable, and the characters impossibly dull. Avoid. Apparently theres a longer version incoming and i do not know why anyone would want that."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,I must admit I am going to wait for the Directors Cut.... I tried watching it but stopped halfway because everything felt rushed and shallow. Their was so little character development... it did not draw me into the plot line!
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was hoping to like, or even love, Rebel Moon; but it left a lot to be desired and I found myself bored. The writing was bad, the characters poorly developed, and the action sequences were just a mess of slow motion/fast forward special effects. The were only a couple characters that had any intrigue and they were completely ignored for most of the film; likely setting them up for more in the 2nd part. But with how forgettable part 1 was; I don't know that I even care to see more."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie. It kept me entertained throughout.  Visually stunning.  Interesting story that I want to see more of. 
The biggest issue is that you can tell a lot of the backstories for the characters are missing. The director's cut should fill in the gaps. 

Other than that it's a great start to a new universe.  And overall a very entertaining film."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it wasn't half bad. I am not that tapped in to upcoming films to have been aware this was coming out, and as I was watching it I did wonder if it was a Star Wars spin off (had to Google to find out it isn't). I did feel like certain elements of this first part could have been better developed (or not left on the cutting room floor), but will wait to see either the directors cut that I've now read about and/or Part 2 due for release in a few months, to see how it all hangs together. For now though I feel it wasn't all that bad, but I do see why people have a sense there are elements of it that are unoriginal or perhaps ‚Äòborrow' from other films. Still, I would say to folks to watch it."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,2 hours that I will never get back
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Rebel Moon has great visuals and the nods to other Sci-fi media are great, but that's about it. The characters were so bland and the villains so cartoonishly evil that I couldn't get sucked in, despite the visuals. The dialogue is like snippets cut from other sci-fi and fantasy stories and glued together into a barely coherent narrative."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a fun sci-fi popcorn movie. I really don't understand all the hate.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Beats Disney's Star Wars.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Visually stunning including realistic CGI, authentic feeling costumes, beautiful sets, creative animals and unique characters. There was no emotion, there was no attachment to characters and not one bit of humor. I'm fine with the humor but halfway through the movie I didn't even remember the main females name. This movie could have been amazing with a few tweaks! You just don't care or get attached to the characters after they're introduced and it's a shame because they're all very cool in their own right. I'd give it a 5/10. If they had me attached to all the characters, sped up the long speaking parts and helped you understand where certain plot holes were headed I would give it a 8-9. Enjoyable watch. Just need to get us viewers more emotionally attached to main characters"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Shamelessly copy/paste of ""Seven Samurai - by Kurosawa"" theme, gathering fears and concerns that actually came back in our century. There is no new idea and the quality of the story is poor - regardless of the big budget that should ""give success"" for any trash movie."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Nota 8,5 d√° assistir de boa!"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Derivative, soulless, clumsy, boring, but pretty(?)
There much that can be said for a work paying homage to an original, but then there's just outright fanfiction. And this is bad fanfiction.
Also, enough with the slow-mo, It actually makes your action sequence choreography look worse, not better."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"O filme tem uma grande capa, mas o conte√∫do deixa a desejar. Nesse primeiro filme a profundidade de v√°rios elementos s√£o rasos, um ou outro √© aprofundado. No geral o filme √© med√≠ocre. Mas tem chances de crescimento, √© s√≥ o diretor saber aproveitar, se ele consegui."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite the critics who I believe are mostly wrong every time reviewing a sci-fi movie, I really enjoyed Rebel Moon. The visual effects are amazing (yes, probably too much slow-motion) and the storyline is pretty strong making me already waiting with anticipation for part two. I think anyone who really enjoys sci-fi should watch it and decide for themselves."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is a big mix of nothing. It tries to be a Star Wars movie but it efforts not to be, so... It became a western, then an epic movie and then a space movie, situation that never happens. It's predictable and boring. Sofia Boutela is angry or depressed all the time, I guess she still has ""mummy"" issues.
It's better to watch how the grass grows."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Started strong, got the story going, than it felt rushed, wasted too much time setting up the ""why we need heros"" than cheeses out on their stories and rushes them, liked the different planets but they had no personality and costumes were all over. Than the villain is shown getting his teeth knocked out than next time we see him they rush him into a virtual messenger pod, not a medical pod, and his teeth are magically back. Idk had some strong points but felt rushed and got worst as it went on. But left you wanting more still."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Dissapointingly awful. Stereotyped clich√© charicatures with a screenplay so predictable and corney the Jolly Green Giant could have written it.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not a single likeable character, bad plot, no creativity."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,The story was visually beautiful to watch but it lacked soul. There were absolutely no likeable characters because we didn't see any development in that area. It moved so quickly that Im sure it did not connect with most audiences. This movie adaptation was a waste of a brilliant story.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"There is nothing entertaining in this movie. Visually it's decent, but nothing stunning in 2023. Just a mashup of random action scenes that have no real purpose."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Everything in this movie feels wrong. It has no depth and you can always predict whats going to happen next. Massive overuse of slow motion scenes just to extend the suffering of the audience.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"great film,great cinematics and i look forward to the uncut version"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,'Rebel Moon ‚Äì Part One: A Child of Fire' is a flawed space opera with highly stylized action sequences but minus any emotional stakes.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wow -- what a waste of some phenomenal special effects -- tired, mashup sci-fi story with uninteresting characters..."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Need therapy to forget this movie. It looks like he created the film with bits and pieces from other films and games. A scene from ""How to Train Your Dragon"", another from ""Gears of Wars"", another from ""No Man's Sky"", there's even ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". This is a ""fan made"" from YouTube. I still can't believe it."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyable movie, look to see how the franchise develops"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's a nice adventure to watch, a beautiful sci-fi world building and good casting. I didn't love the narrative and think it was shallow and too simple, maybe too much explanation on everything specifically on the recruiting part, the audience is smart than this, we can get when things are not explicit. Overall it doesn't deserve all this hate, as a sci-fi film lover I think we should enjoy having people interested in making movies that imagine fantastic worlds and explore imagination. It could be much better, but I enjoyed watching. It's better when we simply seat down and watch instead of looking for reasons to criticize everything."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed it, more style over substance to be honest and I probably wouldn't have seen in the cinema, but it was a very beautiful popcorn flick that entertained me for the better part of the movie. The plot definitely could've been better without major overhauls, but considering this is supposed to set up a triology of sequels I'm more than willing to cut them some slack.

All in all, I'd definitely watch the sequel(s) however I'm not sure this flick has a high rewatch value. Still beter than most Disney Star Wars movies, Rogue One being the exception."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was exciting, gripping, visually stunning. The stage has been set, they've painted the picture of the world. Can't wait to see this epic story unfold in Part 2!!"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The idea is not new but well implemented. Unfortunately, the Stormtrooper syndrome also seems to be present here. 

I hope the characters introduced in part 1 will be developed further in the second part."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good film, if the critics didn't like it, it's a sign that the film is good"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Worth skipping. Was grossly derivative with some aspects bordering on plagiarism (e.g. if you're going to use a six-legged spider-walker-esq design for your AT-TE knockoff in your Star Wars reject film, maybe don't copy/paste the Fallen Walker from Bungie's Destiny series). Worldbuilding and art direction felt like a mashup of other sci-fi universes, with little to no originality, one could almost be convinced they were thought up by an AI image generator. Finally, it's all brought together by a story so boring, predictable and lazy that the striking vistas, decent acting, and well done cinematogrophy couldn't stop the yawns."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Simply a bad movie with pieces of scenes and ideas from different movies. Mix dune with star wars and a lot of slow motion in every fight and the B series movie is served.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I absolutely loved this movie, set in a futuristic universe yet still having a connection with past times like our own planet earth. A variety of different characters with their own backstory. New ideas and different twists, such creative writing and such an all-round good film."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme divertido, cenas e visual maravilhoso mas pouco aprofundamento nos personagens."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'm sorry... Just too much essence of Star Wars and Dune.... Plus the dialogue really blows... & poor choice of lead actress... U can see that in the cast too, mostly B grade... They should have hired a better casting chief and select unknowns with talents!...i really was rooting for this film... But no!... Thank you putlocker!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,To pass the time it was okey. Hope for the part two to be better.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the best thing I've watched and yes I am a Star Wars fan, but I'm so glad Zacks idea and creativity went through. Feeling lucky to have witnessed a film so great and different to what we're so used to these days"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's counterfeit Star Wars. Boring!!! Actually its clear to me Hollywood releases movies to test ideas and to test directors and actors with the view to put these together into a real blockbuster one day. I really wish they would stop polluting our streaming sites with this puke.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I haven't see it yet but the trailer looks pretty good, so I won't watch it now"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Too much of a mish mash of scenes borrowed from other sci fi films, cobbled together with monologue. The unbelievable plot is based on the notion that a technologically advanced civilisation can travel the stars but has to steal grain to survive!
I won't be watching part 2."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Where to start? Badly written, badly directed, badly acted (mostly). Some great art direction - graphic novel frames that are very nice to look at at.  Made it 1/3 rd in before opting out."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Clearly the critics live on a different planet go normal people.  All the family watched the movie and all enjoyed it.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A kinda spacey Magnificent Seven, small village of farmers seeking help from a group made up of rebels, soldiers & fighters to defend against a massive planet-dominating force. Good VFX but a familiar plot, a culmination of too many similar ones."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Borrows from lots of other grate movies and does it so poorly.  Visuals are the only thing that are decent.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a great movie to start a series, could be better at the end but this is really not the end, there'll be more to follow I hope; still so many unanswered questions ans journeys to explore. Can't wait for the next one. Ofcourse critics will always think differently as they are somewhat removed to the rest of us normal people."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Set the bar a little low and settle in for some amazing eye candy and easy entertainment. A great father and son evening.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. True to Zack S style.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This film is god awful, it feels like more of a fan film with a super low budget. 
The characters are all caricatures, with cliche lines, cliche intros. 
There's not a shred of originality or something of interest in this entire film."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"After watching the trailer, I had high expectations, but honestly, the movie is a 1.5/5. It's the typical film where just 30 minutes into watching, you know who will betray them, who will save everyone, and what the outcome of the whole story will be throughout the film. They make the female protagonist extremely powerful; the secondary characters are almost useless and are not generally ""introduced"" to you. They touch a bit on the backstory of the main character but nothing beyond that. Throughout the entire movie, the protagonist doesn't even get a scratch; no bullet hits her, and she dodges every blow. It's like she's a god fighting because I can't explain how she manages a 1 vs. 5 alone without getting hurt. Overall, a pretty mediocre movie, another one of those that tried to copy Star Wars but backfired. I don't recommend watching it, but if you want to waste 2 hours of your life, go ahead."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved the visuals and the world. The story was a bit choppy at times. Can't wait for the director's cut!
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Good special effects but I never cared about the characters. It feels like a video made by a sci-fi fan mixing everything they like about other movies but without any story to tell.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The only thing I found interesting in the movie was the graphics, story was easy to predict, nothing that could surprise you, the worlds lacked any backstory as to what they are and characters lacked, well, character... I'd say it's alright if you want something to turn your brain off to. Or to fall asleep."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had an awesome time watching the movie. It was fun for the family, and a series of like to get more into!"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"A bit too much exposition to fill in the narrative  gaps but it's not a bad movie, people want to hate deviate it's not perfect but nothing is."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Been feeling a void since they discontinued the expanse and this filled that void. amazing movie.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just another kids movie.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought this movie was tremendous and cannot understand the negative press it is getting. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was definitely better than the last 3 Star Wars movies. Cannot wait for Part 2 and hopefully 3 and then 4.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Couldn't get passed the first few minutes.
Plowing with a hat horsed? really? In a age of space travel?"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I really  enjoyed  it even with the dodgy Northern Irish accent.  It quite  clearly  is only half a movie. It visually  stunning....
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the kind of epic sci-fi I love!
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I find the script just horrendous. Some parts doesnt add up, and I find it very one-sided. One example is the part where they met General Titus. It was very bland and the script really lacked emotion."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,At its best moment this movie is a cliche sci-fi flick that relies on copying many far better movies. And its best is pretty lacking. Most of the movie is poorly written and poorly acted. Utter rubbish. One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Slow and non sensical plot
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another Zac's movie made in perfection. Score is brilliant, scenes are fantastic and action is unparallel. If you want to watch a serious drama then there is European movies and Meryl Streep. This is pure action with no barriers."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me gust√≥ mucho la pel√≠cula y la propuesta del director, la siento un poco apresurada pero a√∫n as√≠ me gust√≥, y sin duda estoy esperando la 2da parte"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,This is the Star Wars of the next generation
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning, a long time story"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Great world building. I want to see it continue.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"lol this is what you would get if you asked chatgpt to write a space cowboy drama with all the worst tropes of game of thrones, westworld, and star wars."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muy buena pel√≠cula, banda sonora estupenda, buenos efectos, espero la segunda parte"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked the movie, since u enjoy comics and sci-fi this one is great üëç"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie was more boring than the first 30 minutes of the Boy & the Heron.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"In a nutshell: What if Seven Samurai was playing Star Wars in Firefly's house while wearing a Warhammer 40K outfit, but with no character development?   

The good: 
Visually, its amazing, costuming, props, fight choreography,  lighting, and cinematography are all top notch.

The bad: 
The plot is a paint by numbers ""gather the team"" which would be fine, if they gave us a reason to care about ANY member of said team.  There's zero character development, unless you'd consider a few, exposition heavy, flashbacks for the main character, development. I'd have listed the cast among the good, since from other work I know them to be talented, but the script here gives them so little to work with, you wouldn't know it. The dialog feels stilted at the best of times and like they're just dumping info on the audience at the worst. Rebel Moon rushes the viewer from big action set piece to big action set piece never stopping to let us get to know a character beyond ""look, they can do this cool fighty thing"". Worst of all, the big ""twist"" betrayal is so forced that it's practically telegraphed before the character who does it even joins the group. 

There's supposed to be a ""director's cut"" to come later, so maaaaaaaybe the character development was left on the cutting room floor, but unless they're adding another full two hours, I highly doubt it."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, awesome characters. Loved everything about it."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Rebel Moon is choppy, doesn't provide any back story for important characters, and the story is cliche. It looks good on screen, but if you don't like a lot of explosions, it's probably not for you. 

Is it worth watching? Sure, if you have nothing else to do."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,It just dragged on. Story went nowhere. It should have been a series with more background story. Visuals were good. Story super boring.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ok so do critics even ‚Äòget' sci fi story telling? Look at the difference between the critic & audience score- weird!
This movie is beautifully done, with the visual details, world & creature building all so well thought out.
The ships and costume details are on point. These heros collected through space are a darkly beautiful collection of humanities best. Plus fight scenes are cool, well paced and unique, and the protagonist is kick ass. 
Just sit back and enjoy being transported to another realm & stop being so over critical!"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Stunning visuals and great world building!
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,Me parece copia muchas ideas de Starwars pero es entretenida y deja dudas para una segunda parte
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Fresh new take on some sci-fi. Fun characters that are easy to understand and relate to. Good universe building and special effects.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The try to be a lot of things of another movies, slow motion abused, story is a mess and poor..."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"El inicio de una historia, no nueva, pero que deja con ganas de mucho m√°s."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Rebel Moon is frustratingly dull and bloated film with little to no plot and character progression whatsoever. Has the potential to be refined by its follow up sequels.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Some of the acting was ehhhhhhh! But overall excellent imagery and story line. Luv it! Can't wait for #2 in April ""24"". Bummin' sooooo long!"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's ok seen better hope part 2 is a lot better than part one which is like a kind of space magnificent 7
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good beginning, can't wait to see the next installment."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Not perfect but better than anything Star Wars branded for a very long time. I'm looking forward to part two and so is my girlfriend.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Visually good, but predictable and not enough. It's a cross between Star Wars VII and Firefly."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. The visuals were breathtaking. The story is simple but the uniqueness of the characters and worlds keeps it interesting.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie, not sure on all the hate."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun, gorgeous, and dramatic. A thoroughly enjoyable time."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visually stunning, but was expecting so much more. Interested in seeing how it all ends with part II."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Completely enthralled, so much better than a boring marvel movie"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Personal I enjoyed it I don't see why people need to hate on it. It's nothing like the rise of Skywalker or last jedi or anything on dismal plus. I love sci fi film's
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"When a movie is so comically bad that you're not sure if it's intentional for comedic effect. I've seen so many books like this with the prevalence of self publishing, where the concept is fun but the writing drags it down by being impossibly bad. I don't know what the budget for this was, but if you're going to spend money making a movie, why not write it well? This was just one uncompelling scene after another, with plot holes and contrived nonsense, some farce of an ‚Äòassembling the crew'‚Ä¶ I mean, it's so generic and formulaic that I'm writing this through the climax of the movie and missing nothing. This movie is a tragedy and it really didn't have to be."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"An attempt was made. Not enough world building to actually care about the characters or ever remember their names. Moves quickly but somehow finding myself wondering ""how much longer is this movie"". Visually it's very pretty."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Roteiro ruim, tudo muito facilitado tudo acontece pro bem da protagonista. Atua√ß√µes muito exageradas. Ficou com um ""gosto"" de filme infantil em cenas que era pra ser: Olha como esse cara √© incr√≠vel. O CGI √© bom mas n√£o compensa todo o resto"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I was suprised how much I enjoyed this after a flood of negative reviews.  Very straight forward story that ended well for a part one of a series.  Compared to Disney Star Wars I only rate Andor and Rogue 1 higher than this.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Totalmente inmirable!!!!
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'm a big sci-fi/fantasy fan, but boy was this movie absolutely garbage. 

It's like they tried to use a Firefly type vibe to try to cross Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Sprinkle in some Dune and Warhammer 40k, and there you go... the hot mess that is Rebel Moon: Part 1. They can go ahead and not bother with Part 2. 

The gratuitous use of slow motion in action scenes and long voice overs to explain the storyline only sour an already sub-optimal offering. I give a lot of sci-fi movies the benefit of the doubt, typically saying ""great concept, poor execution""; but even the concept here was so convoluted and derivative that even a good execution probably wouldn't have made up for it."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Cool cgi and fight scenes but the movie was so stupid. Typical plot and direction.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Aside from obviously stealing tons of imagery and IP from Warhammer 40K, the movie was a fun watch. 

I'd recommend watching."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Although visually appealing, the plot is weak and predictable. I'd watch the second part just for the heck of it, probably won't remember a thing in a week or two‚Ä¶"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Somewhat original, somewhat ripped off.  I enjoyed the movie and am happy to see some new attempts at sci fi.  I will watch it again and look forward to part 2."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visually cool, but after the first 20 Mins the writing just tanks completely. Direct copy of the seven samurai but with Zero character development. don't even know who most of the people they pickup are until near the end when they are all captured. Everyone is stupid in this galaxy. The directors cut may save it if they include some more context. But this version is rubbish and actually pretty boring."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Excessive and unnecessary use of slow motion during fights, no character development and rushing of the story. Predictable and lazy storytelling"
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"la pel√≠cula no es mala puede tener un contenido mas claro, esta muy bien de efectos y fotograf√≠a, la historia esta interesante pero se parece mucho a cosas que ya hemos visto 
, muchas escenas lentas"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's bad, really bad. There's no build up nothing worth caring for characters are blend and half the movie was film with heavy emphasis on slow motion and wierd effects and the CGI are horrible a total waste of time."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was fun to watch. Even though there are some elements from other movies in the same genre, it still is an interesting story to be told. The main character being a victim of genocide then taken by the enemy and raised as their own is always an interesting concept. It raises the question, do they become brainwashed and take the enemy's side or wait for their perfect moment to escape and fight back for what they did? I'm looking forward to part two and hope that the story continues because I would love to see where it goes."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it it's decent SciFi. I'll give it four Linn Kurosawas from the Capcom video game Aliens vs. Predator out of five!
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What a steaming, out of focus, random slow motion, overly stoic, drab piece of sh*t this is."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a good movie. Amazing visuals. Action packed.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,More enjoyable then many reviewers let on. Take a chance and judge it for yourself.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Too many explanatory segments, the pacing and dialogues are a mess, and the action sequences are boring, leaving only the visuals, but not to the extent that they are stunning.

we all know ""Show, don't tell."" and this ""streaming content"" is the exact opposite."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Horrible. Acting was horrible (which is crazy because they were so good in other movies). Script was horrible.....that was it. Horrible script!!!!! Visually cool, but it didn't matter because both of my son's walked away from the movie. So hopeful."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If you can ignore the fact that they just copy pasted the random scenes from several other blockbusters, - Most obvious to me the Mos Eisley scene from Star Trek or the Hippogriff scene from Harry Potter. But there are multiple others. - 
and if you just like the scenery. Than this movie is ok for you.
There's nothing original to it.  The main plot could even be stolen from ""A fist full of dollars (1964)""  
But at least I wasn't bored."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I sat down excited for this movie. It had a lot of hype. That hype fell flat. I watched the entire thing, though I did stop it 3/4 of the way through, when movies, especially of the action variety, are at their most exciting. I opted to go do some random work instead. I then returned to the movie but only to see  how the train wreck ended. Saying it borrows a lot from other sci fi is an understatement. It also borrows from fantasy as well, which just makes the world building muddled at best. The pacing is horrible and too much info is left out leaving you to almost have to do some absurd mad libs in your head. None of the characters seem to mesh together organically either. If I fully had to describe this movie to someone I would tell them that someone filmed a little kid pretending to play Star Wars with his toys. Except for none of the toys are from matching series. Plus all the toys aren't legitimate licensed toys buy stuff you'd get off Wish.  I will probably watch the r rated version when it drops to see if any coherency is added but I doubt it."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it! When is part 2 and 3 coming out?
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It must be said that the cinematography is really marvelous, some shots are really worth it and the soundtrack sometimes really hits, but none of this really matters when the story is boring, full of cliches and worthless. Although it has good and enjoyable moments."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie has too much explaining going on that could be presented in a better way. The main protagonist doesn't seem to look as strong as being portrayed. Movie has great action, visuals and storytelling in a griddy setting. Hope they make a lot more of these."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie and I would love to see more like this made.  Is it an Academy award winner?  Probably not.  Is it entertaining and have a few surprises you don't see coming?  Yes.  It is a good movie and worth watching.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed very much,   great CGI effects.  looking forward to the 2nd part"
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was a brutal slog to get through. Great visuals, but the whole cast is introduced like a heist film. The entire movie is just an intro to the next movie. Unsure how 7 people are going to fight a galactic planet killing warship... don't really care to find out."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved that they haven't rushed into things and are setting the things up.
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a great movie that had no lack of amazing story telling or fight scenes. Scenery was beautiful.i loved it
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Could've worked better as a series. As a movie it's just all over the place.
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Filme pipoca, n√£o √© nada de mais e procura sempre ser √©pico por√©m sem sucesso! Maneirismos e c√¢mera lenta atrapalham muito o filme, por√©m sem nada para fazer √© sim um filme bom para passar tempo."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Taking inspiration from other genre movies is not a problem. The boring and not engaging story and action are the problem. This Movie feels like watching combination of dull tone of ""Hp: Deathly hallows part1""/""Mockingay Part1"" with the clumsy story and action scenes from the ""Suicide Squad"" (2016). 
Good wordlbuilding and some visuals. Not great, not terrible. Should have been better."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I gotta tell yah I wanted to like this movie but to sum it up, it's a snoozer."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a solid old school part one.  Great setup that begs for part two. Better than dune in some respects. Love the ambition and risk taking. Far too rare these days.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"There are many worlds, mergo characters, this is what Star Wars should have looked like, and not revolved around two planets for forty years.
I'm looking forward to the second part."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"In short there is something here, but it is not executed well enough to really be worth your time unless you have nothing else to do. Story wise it is seven samurai in a 40k-ish setting and jam pack it with outdated troupes you get this movie. Is it bad, no. is it good, no. The visuals are good, the action scenes are not, and while some of the characters are promising the majority are lack luster and seem to be improperly cast. I give it a meh."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Simply epic, a myth made reality! Can't wait for part 2."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just boring. There is nothing you haven't seen before and better. Even Jupiter Ascending was more fun.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is a joke, if you're a 13 year old boy you might like it, if you enjoy real story telling and writing you will be offended by this movie and the lack luster script. Big let down‚Ä¶ movie night enjoyable if you're under the influence and can get past the trash. You except a lead female protagonist movie to have more substance."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,A lot of things simply didn't make sense
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'm going to have to agree with most neh sayers here. Over hyped junk, waste of my time. The slow mo in 300 was at least well positioned and followed the right places at the right times but in this movie it felt like someone threw darts at the story board in order to decide where and when the slow motion action was to happen. So many stolen seens from star wars, Blade Runner, Harry Potter, the Matrix to name a few so no originality here either. The only reason I gave it 1.5 stars is because I have a large 100 inch screen which made parts of it watchable. The dialogue was very weak and getting the ""team"" together was laim, if you know the famous western The Magnificent Seven, it is the same but weaker, less charisma from each character. Also wtf? We never got to see the General fight ???"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Zack Snyders directing is that of a child playing with action figures.

Generic plot, barebone characters, just uninteresting filler to get to the action sequences.
The action sequences themselves are filled with childish ""cool"" explosions and almost entirely slow-mo.

Entire movie gathers up these ""legendary"" characters that literally do nothing, say nothing, have zero personality, no crew dynamics or interactions, all for the buildup to this final battle.... that doesn't even happen.

Even the main antagonists and their ship are built up to be this unstoppable force of destruction on paper but I swear even a gentle fart in the wind could have taken everything down.

Waste of 2 hours unless you REALLY love lensflares, in which case you should go watch star trek instead."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visually stunning and not disappointing, even if they went over the top with the slow motion scenes. However the story line was anticlimactic and disappointing, and frankly the similarities to Star Wars, even just the scenes of ships, should be illegal. Really disappointing as the fight scenes for the main character are epic, but it's not enough to cary the whole film."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Bland copy and paste of several major franchises. Very bad script like the writing is poor. Extreme use of slow mo that renders it pointless and extends the runtime needlessley.  Just a bad movie.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Despite it's many, many flaws, overall it is still entertaining and not worse than some recent Star Wars movies. Action is decent enough and visuals are too artificial, but it still is nice to look at. Sure, it's one of the most generic movies ever, like it's story and overall design was done by AI. But the main problem is that it's neither fun, nor thrilling, nor likable. You just don't care about any of these characters."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Visually stunning with the depth of a toddler's picture book. Laughably bad.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Star Wars meets Dune? Messy worn plot with some good action sequences. Space nazis in the Galactic Empire? Worth a watch on a dreary Christmas afternoon, glad I didn't spend a lot of money seeing it at the theater."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Absolute trash. A masterpiece in copying all possible sci-fi movies there are. But ending up as a total joke. After 45 mins it literally hurts to keep watching.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"There's no problem borrowing ideas from previous movies if you use them with some respect and originality, but isn't there a law against stealing every idea from Star Wars? And why does a drunk depressed general suddenly turns into a motivated fighter just because a girl watches him in the eye? Sorry, but this movie is bad."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Visually striking with an ambitious scope but without a clear direction. Its inspiration is clear but makes it its own. The set design & cinematography are beautiful yet parts come off as random.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely has its issues, biggest being that this is basically a long trailer for the ""Snyder Cut"" of this film. With that said I found the world building to be great and extremely excited to see how Part 2 wraps up."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,It's well made and the history is developing just right. I like that has a conclusion and still there's more to see. Effects and photography are quite good. Now days it's hard to please people. We need to seat and enjoy movies instead of criticizing so much every single aspect of an original creation.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So very boring, bad and dull, 
Mediocre special effects, waste of time and money"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Getting a lot of unnecessary hate. Fantasy and Sci Fi interestingly mixed. A bit of a disjointed feeling but kind of LotR-esque in that way. A LITTLE bit too much slow mo. But overall some solid stuff and I'm intrigued for more.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Mala, mal√≠sima, indecente, copia y pega mal hecho de otras sagas. No merece la pena perder el tiempo en verla. 0 estrellas merece"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"great movie, visual effects, actors, acting, plot, superb!"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Poor. I thought they want to do something epic. Lol
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's so bad coz the story was heavily copied from A Bug's life and some reference from star wars they just don't fit well. It's like an AI wrote the story.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,It's been a while since I've seen a new Sci Fi movie (not horror) that is entertaining.    The filming/visuals are well done and the story is entertaining.   I've seen some critics say that the film follows familiar story lines .   I don't care.   Worth the watch.  I'm excited to see the directors cut and the 2d part.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,A mix n match of superior movies that barely make any sense. The futuristic universe they paint is 2D and boring. I feel like this movie was made by movie studio suits who sit around spitting buzz words at each other
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,This film is getting way too much hate for very little reason. The only reason the film is not getting 5 stars is because it felt like alot of the film was missing and I will wager alot of plot and character development will be found in the directors cut that is r rated and longer.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Cinematography was amazing can't wait to watch part 2 come April 24üëèüëèüëè
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This theatrical cut is eye-candy and a basic story with holes that I imagine will be filled in with the Director's Cut. There is a lot going on and a sense that there is way more story to tell than we're seeing with the theatrical cut. Still, this film is entertaining and eye candy and reminds me loosely of the premise behind the 7 Samurai."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"In a world characterized by its slow pace, where time meanders like a lazy river, a touch of nonsense adds whimsy to the mundane. Amidst the deliberate crawl of moments, there exists a peculiar charm, a dance with the absurd that keeps life unpredictable. Within this concoction of leisurely strides and whimsical detours, a hidden reservoir of potential quietly waits to be tapped. It's a delicate balance, a nuanced symphony where the unhurried tempo reveals unexpected opportunities, turning the seemingly nonsensical into a canvas of untapped possibilities."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Not perfect but a lot to like about this movie looking forward to part 2
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I want to keep it short:
A lame spacefantasy Story with a mix up of uninteresting Charakters who fight space Nazis in front of Green screens."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall great popcorn flix, don't really understand the hate that it's getting at the moment! The Sci-fi community should always back new IP when it's released!"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The writing is so subpar that no amount of acting or effects can save this desperate, drawn out movie version of eating porridge three meals a day."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked it, a bunch of bad-asses rallied to fight an empire, much better than what Disney has done recently with its Star Wars movies."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"La pel√≠cula es muy entretenida, la verdad muy bien contada la historia en lapsos cortos. La verdad los ""disque expertos"" cada d√≠a son m√°s p3nd3jos, no saben nada de universos de comics. En esta vida nadie es experto y cada quien tiene su gusto cinematogr√°fico."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Bloomin' Fantastic!
A true return to the kind of epic space fantasy that we all crave!
The only slight let down was in costumes being a little too ""current earth"", other than that the movie is extremely well paced, the characters are well understood by simple introduction. People like to criticise the use of 'tropes', but good storytelling relies upon character archetypes -- you know who these people are and why they're doing what they're doing and that's a good thing."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,The only way to force Hollywood to make better films is by not watching garbage like this.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the worst things I've seen in a while.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Better then new Star wars ......
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A very cliche story that you probably already saw in movies from the Star Wars universe and other sci-fi franchises, same characters and similar weaponry/tech. If you merge Dune with Star Wars sequels you'll likely get Rebel Moon. Good scenarios and visual effects, but they don't overcome the overall lazy writing and not so creative universe. And it has slow motion action scenes, like, why?"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I recently signed up for Rotten Tomatoes solely to give this terrible movie a one-star rating, in the hopes of dissuading others from watching it."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Worst movie ever, I lost 2 hours of my life. If I had a lot of money I would have break the TV"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Yeah ok so it may not break new ground as a sci fi epic with new ideas or creations but ultimately it pays tribute to all that came before with elements of Star Wars, Dune, The Matrix, mixed with Snyders signature style of 300 and Army of the dead."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was awesome
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was great. I am looking forward to the directors cut so we get a deeper and darker delve into the characters. I wish the oversight for releasing a movie didn't have to cut it down. Give these directors final choice and release the movie with their edit. I am tired of seeing paid critics bash the way they do because some people won't succumb to the disnification of all content. Looking forward to the second part but more importantly that directors cut as well.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"A must see indeed! LOVED THIS! A phenomenal one!

This is why I don't trust Critics or what they say about movies anymore. Plus, either these low rating haters didn't see this film, or they just chose to let Critics speak for them. 

I mean, both Critics and low rating haters got this one wrong. Good thing they don't speak for me at all, and I have my own brain and my own eyes. My own conscience. 

This was an inspirational, impactful, dark, and adventurous story told! And I guess expectations were too high when comes to them. The slow-mo in some moments makes this film even cooler! It makes a film mean something!

Honestly though, these lowlives have a problem with the slow motion in this film, but they had no problem with slow motion being in The Matrix films, did they? 

Again, this is a phenomenal film. I was entertained and inspired by it for countless reasons, and I'd see this again as I wait for Part 2.  LET'S GO! ‚úä"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme muito bom, tem tudo aquilo (camera lenta) pra quem gosta do estilo do Zack!!!!"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Like watching a good Anime, it's not for the now too common, zealous, over thinking and over analysing critics among you. But, it's a good watch."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"T√° na m√©dia. Personagens poderiam ser melhores desenvolvidos... parece que foi muito r√°pido. Hist√≥ria interessante, gostei. Aguardo o pr√≥ximo. Mais um motivo para n√£o levar a cr√≠tica ""especializada"" a s√©rio..."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's not as bad as critic's say, but sadly it's not as good as hard-core fans want to believe. AND trust me I am a fan of his. Looks stunning at times, great potential and some characters that stand out. Sadly too much going on, too much non needed materials and fight scenes that are weak. Passed the time but sadly I can't defend this one"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So so so bad.
Nothing about it was any good. Terrible plot, acting, characterization, script, editing. No depth, no originality, no coherency. Just ichs.
The only thing this movie had going for it was its budget and it squandered it!!!!
Was truly hard to get through the 2h+ runtime."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Two words:  ""Space Nazis"""
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. Well acted.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Visually stunning. The story is nothing new, but it's worth a watch."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Unoriginal, poorly paced, poorly written, and filled with cheesy dialogue and characters. So much potential wasted on such horrible directing and writing. Beautiful movie, but nothing else is redeemable."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Would have been better as a mini series or episodic series. Rushed and did not feel any connection to the characters. 
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"it was a fun watch, even better what marvels release today."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,As a stand alone movie in itself thoroughly enjoyed it.. Sci fi effects a bit rough but who knows...maybe truer to future reality.. smokey old ships.. if you want to be entertained for a few hours just watch.. if you are expecting a franchise rehash or' not as good as ' then perhaps you should think about comparing frankenstien with dracula... looking forward to the next part..
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Poor Dialoge. Empty characters. Too much slo mo. Boring Plot. Okayish cgi and world building.
When i saw the Trailer i anticipated so much. Its Trash."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved Rebel Moon from start to finish of Part One. Classic storytelling with good vs. evil. Underdog vs. giant. Totally absorbed in the universe of Rebel Moon. Highly recommend for fun escapism. 
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent movie, borrows from other movies, but then the Magnificent Seven was an adaptation of an Akira Kurosawa movie, The Seven Samourai. Rebel Moon adds a complete original spin to it. More movies like this please!!!!"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Super recomendadisima
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,A lot better than the latest marvel/dc/star wars movies. Can't wait for part 2.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Are we ever going to stop with the exhausted  girl boss tropes?? Only in these stupid movies can a 120 pound person single handedly beat up 3 250 pound opponents, because she is ‚Äòa strong female character!!'.

Zach, stop being silly and lazy."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was great! Critics are definitely wrong on this one. They don't like Synder and it shows. Can't wait for part 2 and the extended version.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Really enjoyed this.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amei o filme. Tanta negatividade dos cr√≠ticos, acredito que o principal motivo √© que estavam esperando uma obra prima do n√≠vel de Resist√™ncia, mas foi entregue um filme divertido, no melhor estilo pipoca. Diverte e muito!"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It wasn't as bad as the Army of the Dead. 

It was flawed, and could have been a lot better. It is better to watch this movie as something in the background."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning, great creatures/races and of course visual-effects‚Ä¶ not sure what others are complaining/expecting from the movie, it was a perfect popcorn action movie for a set-up for part-two or any subsequent sequels or prequels. Will very likely be watching it again when the part-two comes out in April."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Garbage. Movie is garbage.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Deveria ter sido uma s√©rie.

Fui assistir ao filme j√° sabendo das avalia√ß√µes negativas, mas descobri que Rebel Moon √© surpreendentemente legal at√© os primeiros 40-50 minutos. Depois disso, vira uma bagun√ßa COMPLETA.

Muitos personagens, muitos enredos e pouco tempo para apresent√°-los corretamente. Um universo inteiro, tantos planetas, mitologia e hist√≥ria. Voc√™ simplesmente n√£o consegue apresentar tudo isso adequadamente em 2 horas. Foi tudo muito corrido e cheio de explica√ß√µes.

Kora, Gunnar, Kai, Tarak, Nemesis, Titus, o almirante Noble, os irm√£os Bloodaxe, o droide... Tantos personagens com potencial. Tantos personagens com os quais voc√™ *deveria* se importar, mas n√£o se importa. Eu me senti incapaz de ter empatia por qualquer um deles. Nem consegui ficar triste com a morte de um personagem, porque... n√£o faz diferen√ßa. √â s√≥ um personagem aleat√≥rio.

Eu t√¥ muito desapontada. Realmente esperava mais. De qualquer forma, acredito que a Parte 2 ser√° melhor, porque n√£o ser√° uma hist√≥ria de origem e n√£o ter√° que explicar tantas coisas, como aconteceu na Parte 1."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie with amazing visuals. The casting is perfect. Seemed a bit rushed at times and more character development would have been better but I expect that will come with the directors cut. Overall loved it and can't wait for part 2!
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Style over substance. Bad clich√© story, no real character development. Was hard work to finish."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not as bad as people paint it out to be but could have been much better. Not of fan of the main character actor. 
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"These so-called ""critics"" really missed the mark again üôÑ   I enjoyed the characters & the story - the cinematography &  action were excellent.. My only complaint is that I was left wanting more - would have been extremely happy if the film and the storyline continued for an additional 2 hoursüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçü´∂"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"We've always known that Kurusawa inspired (along many others,) Dune and Star Wars. Now we add Rebel Moon to that list. Throw in a little Harry Potter (this will be obvious when you watch,) add some Vikings level action. This movie will not change your life or define the meaning of same. It's pure fun. Sit back, enjoy. It's a blast. I loved it!"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I feel a bit guilty as I switched the movie off after 110 mins. But then I watched an episode of The Critical Drinker about that same movie in which he recommends NOT to watch it as it is apparently terrible throughout. And now I feel vindicated. Thanks, Drinker!"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Had potential for about 10 minutes‚Ä¶ but sadly loses momentum, likely due to a crumbling plot, poor writing, and the heroine's character‚Ä¶ lacks charm?"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's like someone copy pasted a bunch of other movies you've seen 100 times into this, but got the order wrong in spots."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Starts out with a halfway decent setup and then devolves into a ridiculous mess. The pacing is terrible and there‚Äôs zero story to these characters. Dialogue is also laughably bad at times. Everything in this movie has been done better before, no reason for anyone to sit through this movie. "
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Melhor do que Star Wars
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyable for the very obvious and appreciated Seven Samurai in Space retelling. Doona Bae as Nemesis and Anthony Hopkins as the voice of Jimmy are the best characters; hoping the longer cut and Part 2 give us more time with their backstories. It's popcorn space war on every level, and if your intention is to hate-watch a movie because of the director and his signature style... what a sad way to spend 2 hours."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bad acting, Bad CGI. and terrible action scenes. No feelings towards characters in the movie..watch only if have time to waste."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Exelente pel√≠cula buena
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entertaining popcorn space opera.. excellent visuals, action...pure fun..looking forward to part 2..."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This is what I would've expected of a movie the first in its series. It's gotta set the stage and give you the background for what's to come. As an isolated movie, it wouldn't be all that great. However, if you watch it for what it is with an open mind knowing it's only the beginning, it's pretty good. Would recommend."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was shocked by the lower ratings Rebel Moon is receiving. It's one of my favorite sci-fi movies to come out in the last few years. Fresh, entertaining, exciting and looking forward to more to come!"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Bad script. Bad acting. Bad Sfx. Bad B Movie.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Zack Snaider makes a fantastic film visually and with a very entertaining story, what you are looking for to have fun on a weekend, from now on I hope to see the second part"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The first 15 mins was pretty good even though most of the dialogue was pretty poor. The best character was a robot‚Ä¶ who would never be seen again after the first planet. Then the movie falls off a cliff and is basically the protagonist meets someone, someone does a thing and then someone joins the crew and becomes a glorified background actor for the rest of the movie, rinse and repeat 4-5 more times. There's no character development, characters aren't characters, they're just an excuse for a scene. But what did I expect when you have characters with names like Nemesis and Blood Axe, I had to google that because they were so forgettable."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I'll take this over 95% of the Hollywood blockbusters. Sure the story isn't original and it's pacing is strange but it's action sequences are incredibly well shot and choreographed. I'm looking forward to the extended cut as well as the sequels.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's ok, not amazing. The graphics are really good, it's a gorgeous looking film, but the story is lacking."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If I was 7 and this was the THE first SF movie I have ever seen in my life- it would be so frikkin awesome. But, I'm not. So..."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"over acted, dull, uninteresting. good visuals"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie isn't simply derivative, it couldn't exist without other movies being written first, the writers would have nowhere to get their material from. 

If you watch this movie with the thought in your head ""where was this scene filmed better"" you'll have a better understanding of this film and its story than listening to its dialog."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Es conocido que quer√≠a ser ambientada en el universo de star wars, pero esto es un intento sin alma y sin personalidad. Es una pel√≠cula que no merece que gastes tu tiempo en ella"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,This was not good. Such a bad decision to release a bad version if there's a better one. Why would I bother watching another version of this when it was such a slog to get through this one?
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Stars Wars for us that don't like Star Wars - Amazing! Hope this universe gets more content and substance. As for character development, sure there's a lot of them to establish but since this is basically The Magnificent Seven in space (and those guys didn't get a lot of development in 120 min) just enjoy the ride."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is fun!  It's entertaining and the FX are second to none!  Don't listen to the reviews, watch it if you want to watch it.  What's the worst that happens, you don't like it and you move on.  OMG, I'll never get that time back, who cares.  It's a movie, just enjoy it and if you don't then NBD."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Awful acting, awful dialogue, awful movie.... $166 million on this rot is the funniest thing since Idiana Jones and the dial of dysentery...just stop it"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"–•–æ—Ä–æ—à–∏–π —Ñ–∏–ª—å–º, –ª—é–±–∏—Ç–µ–ª—è–º –ó–∞–∫–∞ –°–Ω–∞–π–¥–µ—Ä–∞ –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω–æ –ø–æ–Ω—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç—å—Å—è, –ø–æ–ª—É—á—à–µ —á–µ–º –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω–∏–µ –∑–≤—ë–∑–¥–Ω—ã–µ –≤–æ–π–Ω—ã."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I was thoroughly entertained and visually it was stunning. I think it just struggled a bit from pacing.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the lore, the visuals, the characters. It's heavily inspired by Star Wars and Samurai 7. Can't wait for part 2."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great visuals, interesting world. Sets up the characters well for a next episode."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Rebel Moon: Part One is cinematographically stunning but narratively bereft. You are introduced to an (arguably bloated) ensemble of characters for whom you feel next to nothing, because none of their stories are explored properly. And to make matters worse, nearly every scrap of backstory that is successfully purveyed to the viewer is delivered through a series of dreary monologues. The nail in the coffin for Rebel Moon is the story itself, which is not so much a story as it is a series of hastily glued-together sci-fi tropes from other (far more competent) films in the genre. All in all, it is a beautiful and bland appetizer for the remaining installments, and I am not confident many will be interested in the next course."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"EXCELENTE PELICULA, BUENOS EFECTOS ESPECIALES, ES UNA OBRA VISUAL. LE DOY LA CALIFICACION MAS ALTA üí™üèªüí™üèªüí™üèªüí™üèªü§úüèªü§õüèª"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,So much slo-mo. Lack of character development. Plot is rushed. Rips off so many concepts. I was hopeful the first 15 minutes.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't listen to the so called ""professional critics"".   I loved this movie and can't wait to see how it all ends.  Wished I could have seen this on the big screen.   You want a big epic sci-fi movie; Zack gave you one!"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The Good:
  1)  The story moved along at a good pace.   I never found myself reaching for my phone.
 2)  The visuals and editing were top-notch.
 3)  Action Sequences were well-done
 4)  Sofia Boutella (Kora) is nice to look at and  turns in a fine performance.

The Bad:
  1)  Very derivative.   Not an original idea in the whole movie.  From the overall plot to each scene
  2)  The dialogue is bad.  Really, really bad at times.  
  3)  Outside of Kora, most of the characters are 1-dimensional
       Admiral Atticus Noble is an embarrassing cliched villian. 

Overall, a bubble-gum movie that doesn't require any thinking and goes well with alcohol."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"So after watching Rebel Moon , I have to say

Special effects - meh
Story - Cut and Paste from other better films (Star Wars, Dune, John Carter etc)
Acting - meh

At over 2 hours long its about 30mins too long

Sure,  it's worth watching....just don't expect anything original"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed it for what it was. A space sci fi.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was really looking forward watching Rebel Moon; yet it was a waste of time. Despite the good visual effects/ CGI and the 40k vibes, this movie story sucks @#$. Character development could be done better by  a 5th grader."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I want this film to succeed but sadly the writing chops are just not there. I'm hoping that, like with many ZS films, the extra hour for the extended cut will add some much needed depth to character and plot because it's hard to care about anything in this version. Ray Fisher deserves a callout for his stellar moments, I'd watch a whole film about that guy."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Filme vazio, sem desenvolvimento dos personagem. Horr√≠vel!"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think it was very enjoyable and looking forward to part 2, not sure what the critics are smoking."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I like this movie very much, it's entertaining, that's enough to me"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Marriage of Magnificent Seven and Star Wars... Watch them separately, much better."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was watchable
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme nessa primeira parte teve uma hist√≥ria rasa, acho que poderia ter mais detalhes,  o figurino poderia ser um pouco melhor e os personagens poderiam ter mais desenvolvimentos nas suas hist√≥rias,  principalmente no seu recrutamento... Mas de longe temos um filme t√£o ruim como as cr√≠ticas est√£o colocando esse filme, temos bons efeitos,bom elenco e um universo que tem bastante potencial !  Espero que a segunda parte melhore esses pontos .  Novamente repito,  √© um bom filme e n√£o merece ser crucificado do jeito que est√° sendo , fico feliz que o p√∫blico est√° aprovando e n√£o ficando com passe "" nos cr√≠ticos ""."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visuals, ok. I wish this was a silent movie. Dialog is so bad I wonder how these actors were ok to be part after reading the script. Money had to be real good!"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Basically a super cut of every popular sci-fi move mashed together with no character design and too much slo-mo. Tacky and chiche. Once again Zach needs to stop making movies. He's past it.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"That was a big ol' oof! A feature length prologue designed for audiences to engage with it's characters, their situation, the world etc but it all felt just so... meh... A bunch of contrived storyboard panels mashed together with what feels like no coherent plan or substance. An Ocean 11 style ""getting-the-team-together"" spread across 2 hours and each of the players involved don't offer anything unique and to be honest if their names were not being mentioned over and over again I wouldn't remember who any of them were, even Kora. All in all it's a shame because I was looking forward to a new IP, even it was from Synder, someone who hasn't created anything really outstanding since Dawn of the Dead imo... sorry SnyderCult."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,I honestly do not get how movies this bad keep getting made. The special effects are great everything else is terrible
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really, really liked this. Intentionally watched it before reading reviews. Obviously there are recognisable themes in the story (a journey, an overarching peril, a moppet, a traitor, a disgraced but genius general, a brooding female heroine etc. etc) - and yet it is a swashbuckling, exciting epic. The cast is broad, diverse and visually stunning - there is chemistry between the leads - the heroes and the villains are credible - and the core peril (an empire devouring itself) is a worthy platform. I would give it 5/5, but we still need part 2!!!"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked this movie. Some of the pacing was off, but overall a very well done movie. It was enjoyable, with some great characters, and I can't wait for part two."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The film looks pretty, but it lacks depth to the characters. The pacing was way to fast for you to really be invested in anything or anyone in the plot other than the main character. I honestly felt like I was watching a dozen other movies, that I've already watched, while sitting through this. Star Wars? Check. Seven Samurai?  Check. Throw in an M. Night Shyamalon twist, that everyone could see coming from a mile away, and you end up with a really mediocre movie."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Poniendo todo en su contexto real, es decir que es la mitad de la primera pelicula de una nueva IP pensada para ser seis peliculas, novelas graficas, corto de animaci√≥n etc, la mayoria de las criticas negativas que est√° recibiendo que absolutamente vacias de contenido y carentes de sentido.
pare que alguien tiene mucho miedo de que esta nueva IP pueda hacer sombra a las suyas.
La pel√≠cula es de factura impecable y te deja con ganas de m√°s, mucho m√°s.
https://youtu.be/SseoIzXmNuc

Putting everything in its real context, that is, it is half of the first film of a new IP intended to be six films, graphic novels, animated shorts, etc., most of the negative reviews it is receiving are absolutely empty of content and meaningless.
It seems that someone is very afraid that this new IP could overshadow theirs.
The film is impeccably made and leaves you wanting more, much more."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Nice visuals, but story and characters are so shallow. One of this watch and forget."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing VFX and characters. An excellent part 1
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Please don't waste your time with this movie. It's 2 hours you won't ever get back. Bad acting is BAD. Narrative has so many holes and you are just left confused and frustrated by the end.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not really sure what this was, most is a copy of something we have seen again and again, but mostly in blurry slow motion."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"You wouldnt know a good movie if it bites you in the ass.....
Great movie to kill 2+hrs"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"While an R rated longer cut will be much appreciated, Rebel Moon is still lots of fun, visually stunning and epic! It is everything we need in today's blockbuster market oversaturated with 300 million dollar superhero movies."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,A desperate attempt to recreate Akira Kurosawa's 7 Samurai set in space but with heavily over dramatic attempts in creating tension. Decent CGI can't make up for the atrocious script and the huge plot hole of a system fairing army not completely decimating a pacifist village and a few mercenaries.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Had to stop after few minutes, story was dull and cringy. Characters flat and quite pointless."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was meh. Very cliched and seemed to take inspiration from every scifi movie ever made. I have no idea who the characters are and by the end I didnt really care. Felt like I was watching a tv series cobbled together into a movie. If you dont watch it you wont miss anything.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Enjoying this slice of mindless fun but forget Star Wars - this is a sci-fi remake of The Magnificent Seven with many parallel scenes and references.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I cannot say enough good things about this movie. Kora was amazing. She is a natural hero and fighting to get back all of her humanity back. The romance was not forced. It's subtle and has the potential to blossom. I want to know more about Prince Tarak. I wonder what happened to Aris. They should have spinoff series exploring all the other characters. I'm gonna watch it again tomorrow. I wanna see the Director's Cut and Scargiver Part 2 really bad. Glad I don't  have to wait long. I had to see this movie before Aquaman. Definitely, Rebel Moon is better than Aquaman The Lost Kingdom. I like both but Rebel Moon stands out."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,i just could'nt pay attention the dialogue was cringe and cgi looked weird at some point. but the idea of the movie is good and hope the part 2 is better
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I've seen a lot of expensive bad movies but this one takes the cake. Every aspect of the movie is just bad. If you are too curious just watch for a few minutes and if you start to see how bad it is, stop watching cause it's not gonna get better."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As always, Zack's ability to create visually immersive scenery is top notch. However, I firmly believe he should completely stop writing and directing as his vision is always disjointed and discombobulated. Enough please."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it, a great Segway into the next movie. These critics need to pull their heads out of their butts."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Hacendado Star Wars.
Poor story and no interesting at all."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,This could be the start of a whole new franchise! It's a strong start. Can't wait for more in April!
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Personally I believe this movie to be a great sci-fi action movie. Although many see a substantial amount of problem with the movie. Let's discuss. First off the intro to this movie is slow and the grabbing of sand to smell is off putting to put the least. Not a great start. Although many of the fight scenes are amazingly choreographed and the visual effects make a spectacle of a movie, this is not enough to carry a movie alone. The story telling is a tough subject, many thematic choices and the fact this is a two part story limit the first film to as set up for the second. Meeting characters, history's , so on. Which I didn't see as much a problem. Biggest concern being the lack of use of many of these characters in the ""unexpected"" final fight scene. I wanted to see the farmer fight in the fields, and the robot was barely in the film. Although I chalk most of this up as movie prep for the second film. Overall I genuinely enjoyed this film and would recommend (when the second releases). It's half a story, and I'm treating it as such. It's like stopping a movie half way through, it's unsatisfying ultimately. I'm excited for the rest."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was a jumble of several trailers for other movies I'd definitely see, but all completely disconnected from each other."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"There could be a good movie in here, If Zack had handed over character development to a decent director rather than just info dumps every five minutes, there is no character development and barely any character Interaction, which makes them hollow, merely vessels to get from one pointless set piece to another, I mean what was the point of the bird scene, or the spider entity scene, its just action for the sake action."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"So glad the critics are getting slammed. No.1 in over 60 countries. Loved it, can't wait for part 2."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie does tell rather than show a bit too much, but for what was going to be Star Wars movie, it was way better than the last three main Star Wars saga movies (I think they had great actors, but horrible and pretentious writing), this was at least entertaining, without plot flaws. It grew on me more with the second viewing. Looking forward to Part 2."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"1000 kings? Not sure you know what that means! seeing how only one blood line died, to end the line? what happened to the other 999? I wanted to like this but did no one do a read thought?"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the universe, with strong themes and visual styles.Looking forward to the Directors cut and part 2."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this movie. Kora and the rest of the characters are chosen very well. The whole cast looks great. Kora is hot. Tarak is smoking hot. Those abs are to die for. Aris is very handsome. The movie was very stylish and intensely vibrant.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Sooooo disappointing. Pretty generic, predictable stuff."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's kind of like Riddick without Riddick. Or the Witcher without Geralt. Or Die Hard without John Mcclane. It's got an imaginative world that takes itself seriously, too seriously, but no one to comment on it and let the audience in on the joke."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Yes, this is indeed a mash up of different genres and prior story lines from other movies and plots. However telling them and matching in one new story would be a daunting task but I think achieved in this movie. 

If the story is not your cup off tea, the effects and cinematic experience alone would make any true scifi fan happy. After all, this is only part 1."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Kora was a hero who didn't want to be a hero but necessity brought out the bravery in her. I like that she was not over confident. Sofia Boutella's acting was superb for action sci-fi. This film has a lot of heart. It reminds me of when I first watched Fellowship of the Ring LOTR Part 1.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Mid story line, Good visuals - fine one to pass time with friends & popcorn. Will gladly see next part."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Hairy plower and the Vikings of Dune.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, kept me engaged the whole time."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was a pretty but boring and derivative film.  The good; Costumes, most of the fight choreography, cinematography, etc...  The bad; poor character development, bad storytelling, derivate plot, and loads of cliches.  It is almost a B movie; with cartoonishly evil villains, a character that stays shirtless and oiled the entire movie, and griffins."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The hero's journey is a age old tale. This movie is a good hero's journey tale in the spirit of many others. It isn't deep, but I'm really interested in the characters backstories. It's a good yarn that looks beautiful."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The story is plagiarism of other, better works. The main character defeats all combatants that attempt to win. The only reason we kept watching was to guess the next movie or franchise that would be plagiarized.  We made it a game. I will NOT continue to watch the following episodes/sequels."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well, enjoyable, fun and characters I wanted to learn more about. Great music, CGI was a little too obvious in places but Jimmy wow. I just enjoyed every bit of this movie and yes it's obviously inspired by many other sci fi, but give me more of this. I would have preferred a more adult version of this movie to be honest though."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Horrible writing and pacing
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Worst movie ecer watched
wasted my time"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was it the most ground breating thing ive ever seen? No was it well made, well acted, fun and importantly new? Yes. Watch it, have a good time."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I'm blessed with ""suspension of disbelief"" being one of my abilities. Take all the critics' whining about previously used sci-fi  tropes from other productions and reduce their significance. If you are are watching this movie, you know what you're gonna get. Maybe the critics need to find a new profession... like reviewing the newest ancient Greek tragedy found among the ashes of some wartorn city in the mideast. This is sci-fi for entertaining those of us blessed with a level of suspension of disbelief that is not weak kneed at the sight of a sounds and sights that have been seen before. 

Kora is good. Moody. Terrifying to those who are her enemy. 

The robot. OMG! Anthony Hopkins is the voice? And with more humanity than humanity itself. Brilliant! 

Farmers who just want to dig in the earth and grow food. What more humble and honorable people need defended against the merciless ""motherland"" in other movies? 

You want entertained? Enjoy the movie. You want to feel like you are reliving your first ever glimpse of some childhood hero and villain, grow up."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is a visual wonder but really falls flat everywhere else. Not nearly enough character development is attempted to make me interested or invested in this world and almost the entire plot can be traced to better sci-fi fantasy works. I was so hopeful about seeing elements from other works I enjoyed (Warhammer, Star Wars, Dune, etc.) but I left seeing nothing but an unorganized uninspired mess of the elements with no clear passion. I'm hopeful the second part will prove me wrong but so far, I'm not impressed."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A mix of scenes from star wars, harry potter, ww2 movies and dune. Simply weird."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Aburridisima. Hace mucho no ve√≠a algo tan malo en pel√≠culas pero tan bueno para inducir el sue√±o.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"While not groundbreaking, still an awesome movie with great visuals. Spoiler- Nemesis gave me Anime vibes! Loved it! Cannot wait for part two and more!"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I'm watching it for the second time now. It makes more sense. Zack is a genius storyteller. Everything about this film looks great. The colors are magnificent. The only thing I would add to it is more soundtrack music during the fighting.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible. Basically a retelling of seven samurai but incredibly bad. 
The first few seconds of the movie, she pauses the plow to move a rock then smells the dirt. Such a stupid moment. I get the director is trying to set a character but it did not play well. It only went downhill from there. 
How many characters do you need that are ""out for revenge against the empire because their entire planet was wiped out and they are the sole survivor""? I counted at least 4. Couldn't someone have written a unique backstory? 
No dialog between the gathered warriors, they all just accept the story at hand and to go along for the ride. 
If each of the warriors are found so easily, why couldn't the empire have picked them off before?"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,A really expensive piece of trash. Character development was utterly trash. Action was deplorable. Dialogue was incredibly shallow.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such a breath of fresh air compared to the garbage from Star Wars, Marvel, and DC recently. 

You can tell the director didn't pay the tomato fee to get a good score üòÇ. I mean, if you read for some reason companies can just pay for a good
Score? Explains a lot tbh."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was so bad I made an account to say it was bad. I saw that the audience reviews were much higher, there's lot of good movies with 60-70% ratings but this one just sucks, so I made an account to lower the average. Do not waste your time. This movie was so inconsistent and stupid. The costumes were so bad, the villains had a mix of space Nazi outfits, us army lookalike outfits, and these weird clergymen things. It felt like they were using whatever leftover props they didn't use on other projects. They stole elements from like every space sci Fi they could. The story was basic and lacked depth. They went on journeys for numerous characters which ended up serving no purpose. This movie was laughable.The special effects were cool though."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is a mess and cesspool of poor Storytelling, Poor Character work, poor CGI with many narratives and tropes copied from far better works and I almost forgot about the cringe dialogue and hamfisted exposition dump"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Rebel Moon looks great most of the time. The story feels off until towards the end of the film; what happens there makes earlier questions mostly answered. Like The Force Awakens, the sequel will determine how much I like this one in the future. On its own first reaction: 6.5/10"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was aaaawful. For bad movies, this one went ""plaid"". A pair of out of work writers from the Pornography Screenwriter's Guild could of drummed up a better script overnight. The cinematography was really cool and well done. Outside of that, puke."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I liked this movie!  It is very entertaining, and the special effects are very good!  I would dare compare it to Star Wars, and it is better than all the other space adventure, sci-fi, that has come out recently.  I look forward to the second movie!"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the most boring and over all not visually appealing  very disappointed In this movie
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This actually had potential, but I kept waiting for it to suddenly make sense. By the time I realized it wasn't going to the film was half over and I'd seen nothing but derivatives of a half dozen other IP's mashed together in an incoherent mess. The only reason it gets half a star is it's nice to look at."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Its cool space and fantasy movie
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think the movie was great. The action sequence was wonderful the CGI was jaw-dropping. I enjoy movies like this because it draws me away from everyday life and bring me somewhere else other than here in the current realm of society. 

I would recommend this movie to anyone."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Nice to see an orginal story and not a remake of an 80s movie. 

Be very interesting to see where it goes ."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Sloppy incoherent storyline, endless stream of uninteresting characters with dumb introduction stories, not to mention the (badly) copied platera of better movies. The robots acting was the least mechanical of them all... "
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"These so called critics are clueless. We get it you don‚Äôt like sci-fi.  Don‚Äôt watch it then.  
This is very good. If it happened in space I most likely watched it.  Take it from a fan of sci fi not from these critics trying to make a name for themselves.  Critics will be critical. I just love scifi movies."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Train wreck. Worst movie in a brutal year for film
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sofia Boutella as Kora is here to stay as a new strong female character 

Anthony Hopkins as Jimmy, will steal your heart 

And 

Rebel Moon is a brand new unique story that will leave you asking for more.

I can't wait to see what is next from this new epic universe"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible, boring story, boring action, really looked good from trailers, sorely disappointed"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Amazing visuals, the history looks a poorly written plot of a video game designed to get sci fi fans. A series of copies and stereotypes"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"on the scale of Star Wars to Dune this movie is right in middle. 
Not even close as great as Dune, but way better than any Star Wars movie"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,please don't make another one. Unless you are reviving MST3000. Seriously please don't (I was kidding about the MST3000)
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I found this movie visually spectacular and the sound stage absolutely wonderful! Visually and this viscerally stunning. In my home theater the crashing of One of the larger ships had me experience some of the bass in my system that I had never felt before. It's a bit too much like so many other movies, but unique enough that I very much willing to get five stars! It's a combination of Star Wars, a taste of Dune, and other movies. Very much interested in watching the second half and hope that this becomes a long series of movies."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is far better than these so called expert critics say it is.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed the movie very much . Waiting for the second part
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Deplorable character development. 
Horrible writing. 
Bad CGI. 
Abysmal cinematography. 
Terrible fight choreography. 
Questionable direction. 

It was like a made for the sci-fi channel ripoff of star wars and warhammer."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Storybuilding isn't strong in this one.  Acting and visual effects are pretty decent; though not enough to make the movie good, great or exceptional.  I find the costume choices for baddies to be unoriginal and derivative of 1940s Germans (You know the ones).  Sadly, it fails to give any depth to the protagonists or meaningful backstory.  I really wanted to enjoy this movie, but it fails to deliver any greatness whatsoever.  Sad."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a little slow at first, the second half of the movie was excellent. Can't wait for the part 2."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was awesome. These critics are too full of themselves. It reminded me of the second Riddick movie. Fun space hero movie with cool characters and plot. Cant wait till the second one. Def check this movie out.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"PG-13 Rating is a mistake. Holding back an actual full cut with an R rating, calling it a director's cut just gets more attention and views on the film when it doesn't need it.  This movie isn't even fun and I don't care to see the second part because I don't care about the characters at all.  I would've rather seen an R Rated, directors intended cut that was fun and had any passion to it.  This is lifeless."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I think if the advertising for this show had stayed away from it being influenced by Star Wars, my expectations would have been different. I liked some of the plot twists, some of the characters, but I constantly found myself comparing scenes(the bar scene, the landers, that robot or android), to Star Wars and it wasn't close, nor do I think it was meant to be. I will watch Part II, but I am better prepared for what to expect."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was awesome, love the cast and the story, warhammer meets star wars"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love fantasy but not space movies - like not really into Star Wars - and thought it was fun and entertaining to watch. Is it deep? No, but enjoyable and visually gorgeous."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The worst movie of the year. A plodding, pretentious collection of cliches. This movie thinks it's so edgy but as every conscious attempt at edginess, it comes across as puerile. Save yourself 2hrs"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Entertaining enough. A little too obviously derivative of some great movies and fell a bit flat. Visually great. They should have employed a script writer.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fairly entertaining. Not original but some great visual effects.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Visual effects are awesome. I liked everything about it. Can't wait for Part 2!
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Visually stunning and engaging characters.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If you must torture yourself for 2+ hrs, well then do I have the perfect movie for you. 

Haha this was just a poor compilation of  slow motion scenes edited by a 10 yr old. You will feel zero connections to any of those characters. You won't care if anyone lives or dies, let alone ""this revolution"". 

Jokes on me though, because I still watched 1 hour of this before giving up."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"wowa, that was hard to sit through."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,yikes.... i really hoping this would be a great movie... it was kind of cheesy and nothing original... seems like Zac just took different ideas and put them together... i don't think i will bother seeing the second half!!
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its an entertaining movie. good action and visuals. If you are looking for something that is close to reality you will be disappointed, but for pure entertainment and as a fiction, it is great and is a visual treat"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Loud, boring, pointless, and awkward, Rebel Moon wears many grand inspirations on its sleeve (from Star Wars, to Seven Samurai, to Warhammer 40K, to Princess of Mars, and beyond), and yet somehow pulls all the wrong lessons from those sources. The end result is a painful dull, self-indulgent slog that occasionally flirts with some genuinely good ideas only to squander them. Unfortunately, this movie is simply not worth anyone's time."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Have you ever read Steven Eriksson's Malazan Book of the Fallen book-series? It's an epic high-fantasy series well worth the read, but it's always been kinda love/hate due to its complexity and unwillingness to hold the reader by his/her hand. The story told in the series takes place in a world with hundreds of thousands of years of history and context and, for lack of a better metaphor, basically throws the reader into the deep end of the pool to sink or swim. Those of us that learned to swim learned to love the books. The ones who drowned not so much.

The books work, in part, because they build and present strong and memorable characters that can drive the story and keep it coherent when the context is missing. This takes time, effort and a clever pen but Eriksson lives up to the challenge and the series is well hailed as one of the great ones.

This movie made me think of Eriksson. This, I think, is how a movie would look if someone decided to make an Eriksson-inspired film with deep lore and lots of complexity and context but forgot about the part where they also needed strong and believable characters to drive the story forwards. Because they most assuredly did. Forget about the need for believable characters, that is.

Don't get me wrong, the characters are strong. Any and all of ‚Äòem seems capable of taking out an entire platoon of soldiers at any given time, at least until the plot-armour weakens. That, sadly, does not mean that the characters are believable or able to carry the films lacking scrip or pacing. Because the movie is sadly underwritten in this regard. The scrips consist of people talking ‚Äì at ‚Äì each other, often in an unintended parodically manner, not people talking ‚Äì to- each other in any meaningful way. And the pacing is not just lacking, its plain gone. Often we are forced to witness a more-or-less random scene where people - who have just met and doesn't know each other ‚Äì tell of the most intimate things in order to either establish some sort of tragic background or to make us believe that this is a sort of bonding moment between the characters. To say that it's unbelievable is an understatement.

In sum we are left with a bunch of stereotypical archetypes ‚Äì an assassin, a rebel, a misunderstood and (most likely) unfairly judged traitor, the mandatory actual traitor, the tragic general, a prince and a few others I can remember just now. They are all honourable, have a stereotypical trait or two and are willing to take up the fight with the evil overlords who conveniently dress, talks and acts like nazis, random violence and torture included, so that the storyline can soldier on. This is not the way to build or present your characters, this is not the way to tell a complex story (or at least a simple story in a complex context). This is ‚Äì simply ‚Äì not good enough. 

The visuals are, for the most part, pretty good. There are some good action scenes here and there. The movie, overall, is mediocre but OK enough for the first hour and a half. But the last hour takes it into the land of the unintended and unwillingly funny and not in a good way."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics are far too biased, this was cinematic joy. I take one star away for a five minute section with average visuals and dialogue. Beyond that this was 2 hours of fantastic entertainment, why we watch movies üçø"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Starts a little slow. Not normally a fan of unexplained super tech but this gets it very good. A scify junkie and this hit the mark.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Rebel Moon was predictable as hell. I got about half an hour into the film and couldn't put myself through it any longer. Off it went.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,A breath of fresh air in modern Sci-Fi films nowadays! Great background story for Kora and I hope we could see more of the background stories for the rest of the rebel squads in the directors cut or in part II. Slow-mo scenes are well delivered to emphasized the impact of the scene. The only downside of the movie is the lens blur for some of the scenes hampering the CGI.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Mute the movie and make up your own storyline.  The dialogue is garbage, the plot is cobbled tropes from at least 5 other franchises.  Chronicles of Riddick meets Star Wars meets Seven Samurai meets a stream of consciousness from three nights of disconnected dreams.  I do feel sorry for the actors who were given this script with what I'm sure were promises of the ‚ÄòSnyder Magic'.  The only thing I thought was cool were the robots which disabled and grasped the ‚Äòrebels'.  The bounty hunter switcharoo might has well been the subtitle.  Not impressed."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Villains Strong
Heros brilliant
Classic Story told many times before, still good.
Over and Over again. Looking forward to part 2."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"There were moments, only brief moments of a good movie. They were quickly interrupted by unnecessary slow motion sequences. I think they could have easily shaved 35 minutes off the movie if they would of left out half of the slow motion scenes.

Overall it was a quality cast and a really good story that was cut short by horrible direction and more slow motion than should be allowed by law."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I personally enjoyed the movie but think it would have been better off as multi episode series to go more in depth and show off it's array of interesting characters. Introducing each felt rushed and didn't really flow with the whole story. Graphics and action scenes were decent but the overall directing style was weird for me personally. Still, it was a good watch and I look forward to part 2."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,Rebel Moon looks like the best video game played by a bad gamer that I have ever seen. The story seems to have been written by ChatGTP or someone edited the movie while blindfolded.  It is sad because the visuals are the most stunning that I have seen in a Sci-Fi movie.  I just wish that they had invested more than 1% of their funds into the writing.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is a genuinely a bad movie. I usually enjoy movies that get a good audience score and a bad critic score but this was absolutely trash.

The plot is bad, the pacing is bad, the acting is bad there is literally nothing saving this movie.

I love scifi and wish this was even mindlessly fun, it is not. I honestly can't believe the same director that made watchmen made this trash."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Daba para una serie y as√≠ se podr√≠an desarrollar mejor todos los personajes. Pero en la era de los criterios cis influencers hay que guiarse m√°s por las percepciones y gustos propios y disfrutar.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good flick! Good character development, good tension, great aliens, sire it borrows here and there but how can you not, everyrhings been done. If you like sci fi watch this."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I like how the exact review number never moves on Rotten tomatoes despite thousands of new votes coming in. It's set at at number at the beginning, very strange."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely loved it. It was one of the best visual movies I've ever seen. Absolutely impressed. I don't understand the criticism. Will watch again üòú
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"How can this be so impossibly bad in the year 2023 of our lord. Don't waste your time with the bad fx, terrible script, horrible action scenes. This is a movie for 13 year olds made in 1995 for the sci-fi channel. Bad fights, bad acting. the characters speak like video game cartoons, expositing things in the most basic terms on the big green blurry screen.  2 for painful hours. Nothing makes sense in this mess"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning with a deep universe with diverse aliens and cultures. The technology is advanced but seems rooted in science.  The protagonist is believable, particularly when fighting, she isn't a Jedi or Rambo but an expertly trained elite soldier. She gets knocked around and hit but always gets up.  The supporting characters all have believable motives for their actions. I can't wait to see the next movie."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While not the best sci-fi plot wise, it scratched that itch for me. Part-1 seemed more focused on world building rather than character, but I'm excited to see what comes in part 2. Admittedly there were times I wished the story began and covered the exposition as plot but c'est la vie."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Predictable/ fast but good budget, nice watch. Don't really feel contented to anyone but invested enough to watch the second. Star Wars dupe."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Rebel moon is a visually a stunning movie
It also has great action and a great story.
It was supposed to be his star wars movie 
But instead we got this and I couldn't be happier definitely one of the best si-fi movies
To date!"
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Well done setting up the story. Hate waiting for part 2.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was popcorn-movie fun.  It was not on a literary level with Lord of the Rings, but very few fantasy works are."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Boring movie! Waste of time.
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"No revolution, but I enjoyed it."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think people are being to hard on this movie, I mean for the type of movie it is I think they did a pretty good job."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is one of the blandest Films I've seen in a very long time. What a shambels of terrible accents, poor Story telling, poor acting, weirdly cut CGI sequences. Desperate to be different from anything, yet so far from anything at all... It's like a weird Warhammer/Star Wars/Dune and mishmash of other Action Films all jumbled together with a predictable outcome and yet feels like 2 hours of just having your brain smashed against a wall. Really sorry for all the work people put into this, but it's just not good. It sadly isn't."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie has amazing potential. It starts out quite good and then goes downhill. Writing gets worse and worse, the pacing is weird, slow yet rushed. And the motivations of people are either unclear or half-baked.

This movie would be better as a video game with cutscenes or a TV show with a slower pace and better though out scenes."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was really good. I hope the entire worlds and plans for the future does not disappear because bad reviews.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was as if someone decided to re-imagine Star Wars without humor, a coherent plot, or engaging characters."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,If you are a fan of kicking yourself repeatedly in the junk or V in slow motion. Then we have the perfect film for you. If they could shoot someone for wasting money and time. The world would have some better movies
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Was able to make about a third of the way through before I got bored.  Nothing new here, seen it all before.  Weaponry and space ship atrocious.  Every actor has a movie they regret making and this will be Jenna Malone's. And why do all bad guys have to look like Nazi's.  I'm a huge sci- fi fan and was really looking forward to this one.  But the trailer was the only redeeming quality of this movie.  I'd like to see statistics on what percentage of people started watching this but didn't finish."
"Dec 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Great acting and characters.  Alot crammed into a short time frame.  Looking forward to expanded cut and learning more of the lore.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Pff fell asleep 
A slow movie, too many characters"
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Naff, unoriginal ripoffs of every sci fi trope with a dash of Buckbeak thrown in. Gave up mid way through as it was just too painful to watch."
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So where can I start, I did not finish it, looks like a waste of time: 

The story is as old as it gets, nothing new under the sun other than the interstellar context but that could have worked if the rest would have been at least ok. 

Some green screen shots are just plain bad.  

- bad acting with just a few exceptions
- difficult to buy in to the decisions of some characters the story goes so fast that just it does not like the missing pieces. It was so easy to understand where it will go, such poor decision making for the main characters while on a big journey. 
- fight choreography makes you think there is no choreography, everything is random. Some slow motion scenes are ridiculous. The actors definitely had no reference for the CGI. 

Artistically is beautiful, but unfortunately that fades as everything else unveils. 

Disappointed"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really good, love the graphics and the action sequences. I don't know the review is so low. Can't wait for part two!"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought movie was great ! I enjoyed it immensely
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was terrible.  It felt like 6 different ideas jammed into an overall concept that isn't believable, kind of Dune mixed with a bad Star Wars and some DnD concepts, none of which are good. The characters are boring, the action over used slow motion to make it look interesting.  Total garbage."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not worth your time.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't listen to the critics. This movie is awesome
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,the movie is slow-paced but has good open stories at the end like DUNE so you know they will make a part 2
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's not bad.  It's not good. It's just fun.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A Star Wars knock off with no character development, forgettable villain and 'meh' story line. Nice visual effects but, overall, total lack of originality."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pretty good, I enjoyed it. Will watch again."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was ok very long and unnecessary at times 

I was bored most of the time and not really paying attention to most because of the writing 

It's an off brand Star Wars and was very annoying to watch at times. 

It's more a back ground noise while I'm doing something around the house"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's hilarious in ways it didn't mean to be. I can't wait for the next one. This movie is so bad, it's fun."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than anything else around right now.   Don't take it too seriously.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Dull. Very thin plot.  No character development. The only fun bit was trying to name which sci films has been graverobbed and stitched together in this Frankenstein of a film. Absolute embarrassing trash. The characters were so poor I wouldn't have cared if they'd all been killed at the end.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you rate a movie on ""it steals from other movies"", you are not rating the movie, are you? All the Star Wars movies stole their content from Foundation Trilogy, Star Trek, etc. 

This movie is entertaining. That should be the only thing that matters. It's visually high class, has solid characters, engaging back stories... Perfect? No. Fun to watch? Yes... Unless you are so jaded that you cannot suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours. Why bother watching SciFi movies at all, then?

Can't wait for Part 2."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The film is ok you can tell that it's been cut down and parts are missing would be better if little more character development also as there is no one I'm invested in.

Pacing is all over place and story is very meh and needs fleshing out not sure just two parts are enough for this franchise to give it any justice."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,A classical sci-fi / space opera the kind you rarely see nowadays.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Good visual effects, but the story is extremely underwhelming.  I would say it would have benefited from a longer run time, but I'm afraid that time would just be filled with more useless set pieces instead of actual world building."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"The plot seems to speed along, not giving a lot of time to understand the motivations of the characters. However, overall though the movie was very entertaining. The visuals were great and the action/fighting scenes were fun to watch. Looking forward to Part 2 coming out next year. I can't wait to see where the plot goes from here."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hatters gonna hate but this movie is 10/10 love it ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è, the story is epic üòçüòç"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Decorated in beautiful visuals and character designs, this space opera is a mixed bag. Incredible cinematography and great battle scenes aren't enough to make us care for the main cast‚Ä¶"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Its a fun popcorn film and that is all I needed it to be. Some characters are deeper and some could certainly be better. The plot isn't Shawshank Redemption but its like a Saturday morning sci-fi cartoon. In the end I enjoyed it.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great action and visuals. Great performances from the cast. Wanted the characters to be more fleshed out.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst movies I have ever watched, complete waste of my time. Story was basically a copy of A Bugs Life lmao"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought this was a good movie.  The film does a great job at structuring and shaping the world as well as character development.  I am a sci-fi/military geek and a gamer.  There was plenty of combat type action on the ground as well as intergalactic type battles.  The movie did keep my attention and I enjoyed it.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Looked like terrible, the story was generic, and the acting made my stomach hurt."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's mid and a rip-off of Warhammer 40k
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Stereotypical cliche characters are just being thrown in one by one with weak character development or explanation. Actors overacting makes you roll your eyes almost every minute. There is also a massive overuse of slo-mo which becomes frustrating after 30 minutes of the movie and spoils every action scene. The CGI looks expensive but it's pretty soulless like in the newer Marvel movies, and the story is nothing more than OKish I guess... 
There are a lot better ways to spend 2+ hours."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Muy buena pel√≠cula, ya quiero ver la #2 pero ojal√°  sea versi√≥n R"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,rushed...no time to fully engage and get to know the characters
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,There's no depth to the characters or any of the relationships. It's all rushed and some of the decisions within the movie make no sense and got to a point it was frustrating to watch. Was really hoping it would be a good one but was very disappointing and unoriginal.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"You have seen this movie before because a lot of ideas, images and lines were taken from better movies. It is a blend Star Wars, Seven Samurai and you name it rip off, with alot of slow motion,but without soul, humor and interesting characters."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie. It's exactly as advertised....a retelling of 7 Samurai.....right down to riding into the sunset. Music amazing, cinematography amazing, story straightforward. Can't wait for the second part! 

I'm lost on the critics lows scores. It's what it was designed to be and wonderful to watch!"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Anticipation was well worth the wait. Nice work on character development.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I wish we could give none of a star !!

What can I say??
Snyder Slooooooooow Moooootiiiionnnn!

Awfullllll MOVIE."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent and epic. I watched it today and enjoyed it immensely. Haven't seen a movie this good in this genre since Rogue One, including Star Wars VII, VIII, and IX, which were pure garbage and probably cost 20 times more. Can't wait to see the extended version and the sequel. Simply, straightforward, and well-executed."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Visually this movie is on par with the best of it's peers. Storyline is a bit weak and it feels like they cut up several other stories and then jumbled the bits up to make this story. There are parts that are simply left without explanation and it just didn't feel very cohesive. Towards the end everything moved so quickly that it felt forced and it felt like they were running out of screen time. So much of this just isnt explained. It is moderately entertaining but there is a major lack of introduction to things and several major plot holes and frankly stale plot elements.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,You can tell it was supposed to be a Disney Star Wars movie by how much it sucks.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"√ìtima divers√£o!! Star Wars turbinado kkk. O √∫nico problema √© oi excesso de c√¢meras lentas. De resto, recomendo."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Dull, over use of slo mo.  Characters are all one level stereotypes.  Style over substance comes to mind and overall just boring"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good sci-fi fun. Legendary? Eh, maybe not, but well worth a watch. Bits & pieces reminded me (here & there) of Jupiter Ascending, Avatar, Star Wars, Dune, Foundation, and even a touch of Star Trek, though ultimately tells its own story. Don‚Äôt understand all the horrific reviews; thought it was good fun and am already watching a second time the next day. Excited to see the culmination in Part 2!"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it seems promising cant wait to see part 2
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Rebel Moon aka (Gomora Vs Thanos) is a great origin story. However, after all the talk about the use of ""Slow-Motion"", I was kind of hurt that there is very little slow-motion in the film. Wayyyy less than Justice League. Anyway, the film is about a girl assembling a team to build an army to protect a village and it's Sci-Fi with aliens.  It's awesome, great action, great character backgrounds, great visuals, overall great story."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Should have been longer seemed a bit rushed good visuals and fun characters and a decent bad guy
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,They are just circling around
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's a bad adaptation of Akira Kurosawa's ""7 Samurai,"" if you wanted to insult him with added cringe in slowmo. Too much slowmo, that's why it last 2+ hrs, which I was robbed of."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Every scene, every ethetics, every single character in this feels like it's straight ripped off another franchise. There are things much more interesting you can spend 2 hours on."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Quite clearly world setting and setting up for Part 2. Looking forward to the next parts release.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,What absolute garbage!
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie is so boring and ridiculous. Like a High School theater project.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,The most only thing worse than the atrocious acting was the almost impossibly vacuous screenplay.  Don't waste your time like I did!
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"First 20 minutes were great then went downhill the rest of the way.
The ships and outfits were pretty neat but the dialogue and story was crazy bad. 
Villain did all the heavy lifting, protagonist sucked."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"While I wouldn't say that I was completely blown away by this movie, I can say that I enjoyed this movie enough that I want to see more and look forward to seeing what happens in the next one. That's really all I can ask for in a movie."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"With mediocre visual effects, easy fight scenes, a bit obvious character arc and way too much trying to be a Dune - Star Wars crossover, this movies has left me bored and not entertained. I was very much looking forward to this movie, but unfortunately anything above a 50% Tomatoscore is just not it. Even for the easy minded and not so critical people, there are way better alternatives for a great sci-fi movienight. Rebel Moon just isn't good."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Samurai 7 meets Star Wars..... I hope the second part ties everything together
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,What the hell was  that ; like really  feels like the  starfield game  lol
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Firstly, I do think this was a promising story, I thought Boutella was great as Kora and most of the special effects were clean and looked great!

However, I think this film fell into the trap of following the Sci Fi epic cliches (evil faction trying to take over the universe but being stopped by a unlikely band of rebels against the odds‚Ä¶ sound familiar?) and films that do that are never going to live up to Star Wars which is why they need to be a Sci Fi epic in their own right rather than leaning too heavily on these influences. Even down to naming one of the main warships of the Motherworld the ‚ÄòImperium Dreadnought', let's just say the movie wasn't the most original.

I also feel the story was thin and slightly rushed and dialogue a little disjointed at times. Plus I'd like to have seen a bit more character development as well as background, we're thrown into this ‚Äòepic' space story with a 2 minutes briefing of the history of this universe and absolutely no information on these characters when we meet them (who they are, where they come from, what their story is). The only character you could say developed and we found a little about was Kora and the most promising character was one we see the least of (Jimmy). Unless you class Ed Skrein's Atticus giving a 10 second description of why each character hates the Motherworld as background. Things did feel a little frantic. On top of that occasionally some of the visuals were uneasy on the eye and Hunham's accent‚Ä¶ I truly hope his character is dead so I don't have to hear his accent again in any upcoming Rebel Moon media. 

That being said it wasn't all bad and I am invested in seeing where the saga leads us and look forward to the sequel with anticipation. The action sequences were a positive as they were well choreographed and the majority of acting and special effects were enjoyable as well. I do want to see more of Kora and see where her story arc goes plus how the Motherworld reacts to the ending of Part 1. Despite the shortcomings there is something about the film pulling me back in for more. 

I perhaps was expecting a bit more of the wow factor and originality from the team behind the film and the budget behind them, they're not exactly amateurs! Room for improvement but if you are a lover of Sci-Fi and have a couple of hours free it's worth a watch."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"You order Star Wars on Wish, they deliver Rebel Moon"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was better than professional critics gave it credit for. And i didn't think it ended on an unsatisfying cliff hanger knowing part 2 is coming out fairly soon. However, it did feel like it could have been longer. A lithe more character development in the secondary characters would have been nice."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Nonononononononono.  Cheap copy pasta from every Sci fi flick, except poorly done.  It even ends with a matrix like scene, and i swear elon musk can sue because they used the term neuralink.  It started with promise, but then turned to boring, cliche, predictable absolute garbage.  It just kept dragging on..  its the plot of The Magnificent Seven except in space and poorly executed, since the characters are boring and feel disposable.  From space vikings, to space nazis, followed by space irish and space mexicans, and the space indian.. then the space Scotsman comes along..  and they find the space jamaican and they go from space Finland to space mexico..   Zero originality.  You'd swear it was max Payne at times, the way they liberally apply bullet time.  They overdo the bullet time scenes.  It makes you wanna vomit.. they slow everything down to try to make miniscule actions seem breathtaking.. and some scenes drag on for like 10 minutes and add nothing to the story.  You literally wishing you could take the time you wasted watching it back.  All the hype for this trash?  Pass, please.  You'll thank me."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,I don't know why everyone is comparing this to star wars this is the best 40k movie we have gotten so far.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,If you prefer your movie to be entirely in slow motion while casting quality actors in wooden roles and not allowing anyone to higher a proper writer then this movie will probably be fine. It's like poor food that wasn't even seasoned but then someone painted to look really pretty. He makes enjoyable movies when someone else writes them for him.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,The large number of negative reviews meant that I approached this film with low expectations. But it's a good film with great action scenes and special effects. I'm looking forward the part two and hope that they do more films and tv shows in this Universe.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Enjoyed the escape from reality
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Writing is so insanely bad
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Some of the visuals were cool. The movie feels like a D&D session run by a 10 year old kid running for the first time, without a clear story in mind but just grabbing scenes / encounters that he or she thought were cool from the different movies he or she has seen. There was NO character development, no reason to CARE about any of the characters, and nothing interesting happening in the story. The movie should have a warning in the opening credits NOT to create a drinking game every time there is slow motion since that will certainly result in death by alcohol poisoning. The villains in any Scooby Doo episode have far more depth and far more realistic motivations than the Emp... Impe... errr, ""Motherworld"" space baddies. This was bad. The only reason why I would give Rebel Moon an edge over awful Last Jedi is that at least Rebel Moon wasn't urinating on a franchise that I actually cared about. This movie was not good."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"There are ingredients for an interesting story. This isn't it. The pros are mostly good visual effects and a good performance by Ed Skrein as the main villain. Unfortunately the script is more tell than show, and the story is little more than a retelling of Seven Samurai in a blended Star Wars and Warhammer skin, with paper thin characters, most of whom are entirely forgettable. I'm not sure the promised extended version in the future can save this, and it's unfortunate that it's even necessary for it carry that burden."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I think it is one of the better films I have seen in 2023 - don‚Äôt agree with the score critics are giving - very satisfying Sci-Fi . Would have been a great Star Wars Film . 
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Decent film, drags on a bit, a mix of the magnificent 7 and Star Wars."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,I wanted to like this movie but the opening scene CGI was on par with the painted backdrops of 70's era sci-fi series...and it was down hill from there.  Not a single original concept to be found ensures you'll be 5 steps ahead of this story from start to finish.  More painful exposition than a Star Wars prequel.  Textbook example of how important good writing is....and what happens when it isn't. Oh and the title should have been Vikings vs. Nazi's in Space.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's so bad. Looks like bad trip. Star Wars +  Suicide Squad and too much slow motion.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ridiculous! I've managed only about 30 minutes torturing myself with that... Awful.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I wasn't sure about the movie, but within the first 30 minutes the movie causes you to be drawn in! I definitely enjoyed the movie! There were parts that felt drawn or not needed, but overall it's a worthy experience for someone who enjoys a Star Wars, Star Trek type feel. The movie is daring and excels making you wonder or take the edge of your seat."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie and it looks like that part 2 is going to be even better, the only thing I didn't get is that it takes too long in introducing characters but with not enough depth to care for them."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"The thing about films is that there's very little that's truly original, especially true of sci fi. So the fact this has elements of Star Wars, Matrix, Dune etc is to be expected. That it does it quite well comes as a pleasant surprise. Fast paced, great heroine and baddie to unite against, excellent visuals all made for a real treat. Looking forward to the next!"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Nice polish but that's all. Stiff, wooden dialogue. NO character development, no sense of danger, urgency, direction or plot. Whatever ideas can be found are all stolen from Kurosawa, Pandora, Tattoine or similar places. I don't care if the main chars live or die, I don't believe in the places or sets. It all seem to have been made on the same parking lot. In one word: Terrible."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Dogcrap full of cliche
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie is not bad, little boring, very predictable and some scenes Ty at makes no sense at all. The camara focus/angles or background blurs make this movie almost unwatchable. I was struggling, such bad quality."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Visually stunning, with a mash up of all your favorite sci fi fills in one. Where it struggles is with it's character development, making it hard to draw an emotional attachment to them. The extended edition might fix that."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was badly written. The script is soo bad. Soo bad. The acting is subpar, yes. But the script is soooo bad. Sooo bad."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,The best movie of the year.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Pretty visuals; however, the entire 2 1/2 hour long plot is just collecting companions on different planets. If I wanted that experience, I'll just play Starfield."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not sure there is an original idea in this movie.  Many of the scene ideas came from Star Wars and Guardians of the Galaxy movies.  Visuals were stunning though.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was so bad I created a rotten tomatoes account to review it.

Just a ripoff of other great sci fi films. 

Some of the worst cgi in a ""blockbuster"" film.

Terrible and cliche villain.

It's boring, filled with slo mo and exposition dump.

Some of the most cringiest and terrible dialogue to the point I would just laugh, especially Ray Fishers characters dialogue.

Speaking of Ray Fishers character, his name is Bloodaxe, which made me laugh because it made think of Guardians of The Galaxy Volume 2, where James Gunn made fun of dumb names like Tazorface.

Just wait for the directors cut because at least that one will be filled sex and titties to keep you entertained."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you go into it, expecting Star Wars, you will be disappointed. However, if you go into it, expecting a good sci-fi movie, you will be pleasantly surprised. It is a good space adventure movie."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I imagine this is the movie we would get if we entered the following prompt into Chat GPT:

""Make a movie in the style of Star Wars, with even more stilted dialogue and no endearing heroes or villains. Make sure the score is the opposite of anything John Williams could write. Oh, put a couple of light sabres in there."""
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Le doy 5 estrellas es muy buena la pel√≠cula
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excelente pelicula, las criticas mas parecen una campa√±a de ataques contra el director, entretenida hasta el final, lenta un poco al principio e impredecible en su desenlace, mejor que Dune, accion y diversion."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't know what movie these ""critics"" watched, but what I saw was a pretty fun movie. Maybe the published reviews lowered my expectations, or maybe some of these ""critics"" have become too jaded to enjoy their jobs anymore. Movie was fun, no more derivative than most movies being released these days, and at least it wasn't some stupid remake, which nobody really wants or needs.
 Ed Skrein was perfectly cold and creepy as the main villain, and the rest of the cast was decent. Looking forward to the next movie, and hope they make more after that."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Creativity outweighs the similarity.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Awful. There's no story, it's just a series of cut scenes from a.game no-one wanted."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Buena pel√≠cula, visualmente hermosa, muy buen score y una historia, que si bien no es perfecta, es entretenida y cumple su objetivo que es introducir la historia, sin duda la versi√≥n extendida ser√° mejor y la pt2 promete demasiado."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Overall the movie was enjoyable.    Reminded me more of Warhammer genre over starwars.   The movie has great potential and looking forward to part 2.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,I liked it - It has clear Starwars vibes (for obvious reasons) but with grit and less cheese. A good part 1 intro story that left me wanting more. I just hope it doesn't stop at part 2. Only criticism was that it didn't pick up the pace a little sooner.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"With fight scenes stylistically reminiscent of Sucker Punch's fight scenes, this is a must see for fans of Zack Snyder's work. He's also the cinematographer on the movie, so it looks amazing. It's possibly a little disjointed and truncated, but I'm expecting that to be addressed in the director's cut, which was made concurrently with this release, and is supposedly like a whole different movie."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not sure why the low score, this was one of the best movies to end 2023. Grinches should just go back to hibernation."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was amazing! People forget that any great story has bits and piece's of other great stories. Even Star Wars pulls pieces from The Foundation. This movie was another important step for Science Fiction. Do not let narrow-minded people turn you away from this!
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Solid movie visually, entertaining enough. The R rated cut should be better though (looking forward to that when it comes out)."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Muy mala. Los personajes no tienen sentido, el gui√≥n es terrible."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a fun movie; that is what I wanted and what I got!
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I think the movie was really good! 
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's an intergalactic re-make  of 7 Samurai/The Magnificent 7, but it works. It's good escapism which is sorely missed  right now in Hollywood. My only complaint is that Zack takes too long introducing the characters and their is too much exposition. Visually, the fight scenes are stunning. Yeah, he does a lot of slow-mo ,but they are fun and great to look at it. Not perfect, but entertaining."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"The plot is exciting and well-connected. Some fight scenes could be less evident they were choreographed. As a Star Wars fan, I see several elements from Star Wars in this movie."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Nice visuals, which is a norm for Synder, but the story is generic and the characters are boring, how he still makes movies is baffling to me."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's not as good as I had hoped, but I enjoyed it. Yes, it's derivative, but so is every movie so using that as a reason to give it a bad review is a bit unfair. The visuals and action were great. The dialogue was meh. The story does feel like it's leading somewhere, but the spoken exposition was a bit much. Would have liked to get the backstory in a better way. I'll say this, though. It's better than all of the recent Star Wars movies except Force Awakens and Rogue One!"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Its all just pollox!! üòÖ The film is just a baltent ripoff of much better films, theres nothing new here, you may as well be watching star wars or dune or anything else made in the last 15 years, very poor attempt Zach Synder"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Dude, just watch Star Wars instead."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If you want to watch a movie that's full of sexual tension, has a character lead that looks constipated at all times, and is chock full to the brim with slow-motion captures (even the falling of grains has slow-mo), then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, you'd be bored to your wits and you'd keep wondering 'what the heck is going on?'"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Esencia de zack, visualmente buena y me quede con ganas de m√°s"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think the movie is awesome.  It was filmed like an art house, or graphic novel movie, somewhat (no expert, but that is what it seems to me), so it looks and feels a little different than what I was expecting.  However, once I understood that, I was completely onboard.  It draws on the Seven Samurai, which might be the only (little) let down.  Not that the story isn't good, but it has been done (a lot).  So, you know where it is going.  Over all, I think its a good watch and I really enjoyed it.  Looking forward to the next one.

And personally, I don't give two cents about the critics opinion, they don't care about the audience, and never did."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Um dos melhores filmes sobre fic√ß√£o cient√≠fica, o enredo do filme deixa um pouco a desejar mas o filme prende muito bem durante essas duas horas de filme."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it. But it feels rushed, the editing makes it feel like we're missing some scenes. And you can tell in the gun fights the laser shots leave some horrible wounds, but we don't see them. This is definitely a pg-13 version.  We need the rated R version now."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie.  I have no idea how it is only 23/100 on rotten tomatoes.  Goes to show that this place is not credible.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I understand this is a part one, but it spends the majority of it's runtime assembling its cast of characters in the most basic way. Then, they barely interact or speak. It gives us nothing for us to care about this group. The little we learn about them is in the form of a one sentence description delivered by the villain near the end. All the while lacking in any kind of originality. 

The lead gets the most backstory told in flashbacks which sounds like a much more interesting story. Truthfully, most of the characters seem to have their more interesting stories already behind them. 

There are some nice visuals here and there, but it also looks ugly at times too. There's a good action sequence early and that's where the film peaked for me. The third act is a pretty standard shootout. It's fine for a film to have a small scale conflict, but there was so little going on throughout the movie that it felt like nothing happened at all. 

Ultimately we got a derivative movie, nothing-characters, thin plot, inconsistent visuals, and an unsatisfying end. Very disappointing."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"There's nothing new to see here. There are space vikings, space samurai, and space nazis and a group of them form a league in a quest for justice. There's plenty of CGI and slow motion shots but the story is seemingly written by an AI that understands all the familiar tropes but isn't interested in any of the details."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is not an original concept and borrows heavily from multiple stories you've already seen, but that doesn't mean it lacks entertainment.  The story is compelling and the visuals are top notch.  Well worth a watch, and I'm looking forward to more."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Es excelente pelicula tiene cosas muy buenas las escenas es tan excelente me encanta to do esto
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Maybe among the worst of 2023 and one of the most difficult films in recent years, to fully watch till the end.

- Story really bland and slow-paced. Maybe with part 2 some parts make more sense but as a movie alone - no.
- Characters uninteresting, Ed Skrein did a pretty decent job
- Visuals, maybe the worst part of this one. The awful use of DoF and ridiculous amount of slow-mo usage makes some scenes look very bad. The film itself has a grim, unappealing look with some nice scenes.

I can't recommend this movie to anyone - it felt like a waste of time."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Les recomiendo mucho est√° pel√≠cula, es muy buena e interesante. La tem√°tica es un acogedora y la verdad me gust√≥ mucho y estoy seguro de que a ustedes tambi√©n les va a gustar."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great first movie that feels like Star Wars mixed with the Magnificent 7. Some ""speeches"" about things are a bit cliche', but overall it was a great action movie with a story good enough to keep it going and make you wonder where it goes in the sequel."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ambitious, dense sci-fi, with some recycled tropes, lack of character development and  some actors (e.g., farmer) not fully committed to their roles."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Rebel moon felt like a behind the scenes and vfx tutorial movie but instead of showing how they did it they just copy paste some 'show your emotion' bits in between scene's from Michiel Huisman.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I asked myself, ""Could it be that bad?"" Any reviews giving this more than 1-2 stars must have been written by the same bots that did the script. Half a star was kind."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it a lot. I knew to watch out for a pacing thing and I had no issue with the middle bit being fast. great to have a new scifi world over xmas. ho ho ho
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Meh, wasn't bad, wasn't amazing.   If you are looking to be entertained for a couple hours, it's not a bad choice.  But don't expect a new incredible epic either.

The good:
Effects and visual quality were great, top notch
Cast is solid and interesting
Fight/action choreography is decent

The meh:
Starts a bit slow, gets a bit better though
Characters are somewhat interesting but not well developed (yet)
Not much interplay between characters, they are just existing next to each other
Acting is ok
Unlike Star Wars, Avengers or even LOTR, little humor.   That can be good or bad depending on what you are looking for (I'm ok with it).

The bad:
Completely cliche, plot is nothing new or groundbreaking
Suspend your disbelief...plot holes abound

The above two points are my only major criticisms...but they are HUGE.   The plot is predictable, totally unrealistic (even for a space scifi fantasy movie).   How are these individuals supposed to fight a huge empire and space ships...with their swords and a pistol?

If the writing/plot were greatly improved, it would very cool.  But for now, it's kinda just ok.   Not a waste of time if you like action and sci-fi, but don't expect an epic.   I'd compare it to feature length ""The Expanse"" with better effects and choreography but less interesting and more cliche' plot."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme top, n√£o entendi o pq do score baixo da cr√≠tica especializada."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Muy buena esperando la segunda parte
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Outstanding, great special fx no wokery at all... which is rare these days; hence the disparity between critic and audience scores"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me gusto mucho, buenos efectos, buena acci√≥n"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Tiresome, confusing. Two hours of a special person story/trope who's kinda boring and ordinary."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good story line but just some Unnecessary scenes that should have been cut and to many slow motion shot takes you put of the movie a bit this seems more like a 1st draft
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"watched it with my girlfriend, excited for part2 really cool star wars vibes"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such a good casting! Action packed film, a must see."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring, over long dross.
The worst film I've seen throughout the whole of 2023."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Disappointing after all the hype.
Enough with the slow motion already."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked it. the visuals were awesome. 
Maybe the acting itself wasn't the greatest"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"""Seven Samurai"" in space has been done before. Underwater or in a volcano hasn't, try that next time."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Inspira otras historias de gran producci√≥n .y deja muchas ense√±anzas
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really liked it, a Wh40k flavour in some way.
Given the last Disney fiascos, give me tons of these and less Star Wars.
Can't wait (but have to) for part two!!!"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,I like that it's NOT Star Wars and who doesn't like a good old fashioned Seven Samurai setup? I think as a franchise it has lots of potential.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I literally thought I was watching ""A Bugs Life"". The first part of Rebel Moon is nearly IDENTICAL to A Bugs Life. They come for the grain, that has yet to be harvested, intimide the natives and leave with the warning that all of the grain should be ready when they return in 10 weeks, one week after the harvest should be complete or face a fate much more terrible than possibly starving. 

Terrible movie, boring, long, predictable and hard to watch. If you didn't know what was about to happen next, you probably already fell asleep."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another one of the great Zack Snyders movies review-bombed by bots and paid-off critics. I for one enjoyed the movie. I thought it was a cool new twist that brings you on a space adventure different from the ones we've seen before. The movie was heartfelt, action packed, and an all around good time. Forget the bad reviews, this is a must see!"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Boring and horrible.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"You can turn off the sound and watch in the background while doing something else. Other than that, this movie is a waste of time. Perhaps if movie director had an experienced screenwriter and director of photography - something more worthwhile would have come out of it."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As with most Synder movies‚Ä¶ Out of proportion slow motion and action scenes, horrendous story telling. I watched for an hour and still had no clue what was going on. Don't waste your time"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Buena pel√≠cula  entretenida  llama la atenci√≥n  verla

"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's like someone had asked chatGPT to write a script for ""the magnificent seven in space"". To say that it is derivative would be a kindness. It's more like a smorgasbord of lines and scenes plagiarized from other Sci-fi movies. The acting is wooden, and the script is clunky - it's like a bad Star Wars fan fic. The writing makes George Lucas seem as sophisticated and witty as Oscar Wilde. Also, the director loves lens flare even more than JJ Abrams. An absolute stinker."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"At its heart, Rebel Moon is a fun ride. Who doesn't love the gathering of fallen heroes in pursuit of a lost cause and a chance at redemption? It does borrow heavily from Star Wars, Warhammer 40k and the Seven Samurai. It's visually stunning and has a good pace. It sets up a part 2 to be VERY interesting. I encourage all scifi geeks to take a look and judge it for yourself."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A full lack of imagination on display. I am surprised the writer is not being sued for poor plagiarism. Dune, Star Wars, and the Magnificent Seven fans are vommitting in their mouths a little. One of the worst character development arcs ever. I had no buy in emotionally. Whoever gave the green light on this piece of stink should be resided to Nickelodeon kid shows. A big waste of time and money. Skip it!! "
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It wastes a bit of time recruiting guys that at last they don't perform enough actions to give sense to them. May be it's because they will have more time in the sequel.

It has original visuals that makes this film worth watch it."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Un poco lenta pero no es tan mala
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Yeah it's derivative but I was still entertained. it's quite refreshing to see a hero's journey trope once more. The film dragged a bit in the second act, I'm looking forward to Zack's cut more than this one."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The tough thing with Rebel Moon is that it has so much going for it in visuals and uniqueness... however, story, dialogue and some aspects of world building are a bit too unauthentic to make this a great film.

Entertaining enough for any sci-fi person to give it a look though."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"the only good part was the special effects , they even messed up the soundtrack as most lines were near impossible to hear over the backround noise in the fight sceens , there is no excuse for that. its a mash up of stolen parts from other movies"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Didn't enjoy it
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Meaningless violence interspersed with insipid dialogue and a tired plot.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolute dog's dirt, with almost no redeeming features."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Rebel Moon, comes across as a notably downgraded version of Star Wars, lacking the depth and maturity we expected. The film feels overly childish, with characters that fail to leave a lasting impression. It struggles to establish a strong foundation, leaving us with a sense of disappointment. In my view, it's a disappointing movie with little promise for the future."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Without a doubt, the most notable thing is this new universe and how incredible it is. There are thousands of things to discover. Visually it is beautiful and has a nice story, although there is still a lot to discover in the history of the other characters. The villain of the movie is one of the best there is. I can't wait for part 2!"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The CGI is jarring at times, the dialogue can be cringey or just outright boring, and pacing feels simultaneously too slow and constantly jumping around. That said, several of the scenes are visually stunning (often quickly ruined by bad CGI or poor framing) and the fight scenes are pretty cool (though they have their own problems- e.g. slowmo). Overall, I probably won't watch part 2 unless the CGI gets some serious upgrades"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Visually stunning. Likable characters. It is a fun ride and I look forward to Part 2.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Epic, great fun! 7 samurai vibe, but played out well with a great cast and scenery! Not sure why Disney turned this down as a concept for a star wars story."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolute trash of movie, makes me appreciate Morbius movie‚Ä¶ acting was terrible, script was terrible, effects were meh ü´§‚Ä¶ I was ugly crying/laughing by the end at just how terrible this movie is‚Ä¶ I found myself confused as to whether I was missing out on a joke movie‚Ä¶ a spoof‚Ä¶ just bad"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's just a fun sci-fi movie. In my opinion, it's as good or better as the Disney/Star Wars movies."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,I'm a big sci-fi fan. I really wanted to like this movie. I really did. This plot was borrowed from other sci-fi before it. He previews look great then the film only lasts 1 found or two in a 7 round fight. It just kinda pulls its punches. Any ‚Äòtwist' the story line tries to build in can be seen coming a mile away. I hope part 2 really picks up. I really did want to like this movie
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Seven Samurai \ Magnificent Seven meets Vikings meets Warhammer 40k in space
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Brilliant.  Loved it.  Only wish we didn't have to wait for part 2. Hoping we get part 3, 4, 5, 6.."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I did have to check who directed this because for a long time I thought I was watching a Star Wars reboot. Nothing original at all in this movie. Being part one, I guess I'm committed to seeing part two in April. Although I will spare myself the definitely not needed director's cut due in the new year."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think all the negative reviews are over rated, I watched it thinking it would be so bad, but I loved the effects, the characters and I got really drawn in by it, the last 40 minutes is a bit of a mess but not as bad as all the reviews are making it out to be‚Ä¶the cinematography is excellent !"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Pretty sure I came up with this plot when I was 5 playing with my toys. ""THEN they meet the Spider-lady, and she's like, ""They're killing my eggs!"" And THEN the Asian lady with the swords is like, ""NEOooooo VRooom!! Pow!"" and she KILLS the Spider-Lady!  

What the hell. Did first generation AI write this trash? Star and half for great visuals. Would've been better if it was a series of posters I could hang on my wall."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Has its problems, like the excessive use of slow motion in some scenes, but overall it is a great movie. Excited for part 2!"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible, the film promised a lot but delivered very little, some stunning visual effects but this does not make up for a terrible script. Main characters giving their own back story is a massive no for me, especially in the first 5 minutes.
Did not enjoy it at all."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,The actors played their parts well. The set pieces stunning. The costume design threw me for a loop and completely shattered any futuristic world building they had in mind. What kind of general in an army wears a suit and tie? Some of the decisions made in this movie are so baffling it completely shatters the illusion of a coherent movie.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"La pel√≠cula empieza siendo un intento de one frame one picture haciendo parecer todo tan ""cinematogr√°fico"" sin serlo realmente, en algunas escenas se desenfocan ciertas partes de la pantalla de manera inexplicable, los personajes solo aparecen si raz√≥n aparente, contexto ni prop√≥sito de ser, que un pelicula tenga presupuesto no es sin√≥nimo de que se"" vea bien "" Godzilla minus one es el ejemplo, es una pel√≠cula exclusiva para los fans de Zack lo cual no est√° mal pero no la hace buena, sino todo lo contrario, el slow motion peor implementado de todas sus pel√≠culas, al igual que su peor cinematogr√°fia, su mayor error es querer ser 300 cuando no lo es, y tener un gui√≥n que parece sacado de una historia que me creaba yo mientras jugaba con mis legos, 2/10"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I saw someone describe this as an RPG when you skip all the dialogue options and I feel like that's about the best description there could be. There's no character development, hell there's not really even any characters. They hired some actors to immediately join the party without any personality or reason to care about them. Absolutely no depth at all. The big betrayal doesn't matter because we haven't gotten to know the characters enough for it to matter. There's no chemistry between the characters so there's no emotion to it.  The party is assembled on a bunch of planets we're given no information about or reason to care about in a universe that short of some generic exposition we don't have any reason to care about.  The action was poorly choreographed nonsense to the point the tiny steps people were taking ""running"" and awkward body posture when they knew things are going to be slowed down just looked ridiculous.  The fights didn't flow and were the worst ""bad guy stands around and waits their turn"" possible.  The story isn't just rushed it's fractured and disjointed. Things just happen without any reason for them.  I have no idea how this has as high rating as it does because this film is trash."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was Phenomenal. Sick of the HIT JOB that these so called ""Critics"" (especially on RT) are pushing. How about write an actual HONEST review and not a Bought & Paid for Review. Amazing Visuals and Great performances. See the Film and stop the hate train Band wagoning.  Can't wait for the Directors cut as well as Part II. Hell the trailer Alone was better than House of Mouse's Disnification of the SW's Sequel Trilogy's. Oh and #FIREJAMESGUNN"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Good Sci-fi movie.  Effects are very well done.  There does seem to be too much ground covered in one movie.  Climatic event seems a little rushed into to save the overall runtime.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Derivative, poorly acted, written and choreographed. Almost comical in its blatant thievery from better sources. Harry Potter, Star Wars, Firefly and more. Time I'll never get back."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is marvelous. Well written, magnificent visual effects and the story goes in a way in which you feel connected with each character. Kora is a character who shows you and let you see and feel the sorrow of being a child of war. Kora pain is well played by Sofia Boutella. Is a shame that all those critics hate this movie. All of them have no honor, respect and suffering from a lack of professionalism. My advice is, watch this movie and enjoy this new world. The action is amazing, the dialogs are deep and well written."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Story was bland and unoriginal. Predictable in every aspect. Feels like scraps held together by thin pieces of tape. Casting was meh. Not a single character I was drawn to. This is something you throw on just to have background noise.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"- Beautiful visual.
- Empty boring script
- Bad cast."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was a predictable, you can tell it was written by politically left leaning people."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's a really bad version of A Bug's Life crossed with Serenity, Star Wars, Dune and Battle Beyond The Stars with a sprinkling of The Magnificent Seven. The slow mo gets boring very quickly, the dialogue is terrible, the story is derivative, there is zero humour. It takes itself so seriously that it's painful to watch all the way through. It's a series of really cool set pieces that look great in a trailer. I really wanted this to be good. It isn't."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Exposition intercut with low stakes action. A good looking assortment of characters you don't care about, or even like, are thrust between unconnected action scenes with little drama.

The use of The Volume is woeful and obvious throughout. 

Part 2 doesn't deserve to get finished."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Cast was great. Story is still building but so far has kept me heavily invested. Can't wait for the directors cut. The movie needs to be longer and I am sure the directors cut will fill it in nicely. Lazy writing? Not really. If you dont like 7 samurai in space, you will most likely not find it appealing. Lazy commenters who complain about the script but can't proofread before sending? 100%."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Overall a good movie. Some cliches apart. Te worst thing to me is the Skinny body of the ""most dangerous warrior"". She is a good actress but with the wrong shape for the role. Put someone like Gina Carano or Lucy Lawless and would be perfect for the role."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,A fresh and mature sci-fi movie that's gonna make you want to watch more! Can't wait for part 2.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Its for fans.. But if you are one. Not bad at all. Cant wait for part 2
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"As one who does not read comics or books I make no comparison in movies. I like to be entertained and that is what this movie gave me. Good character development, good story lines. Only complaint is movie was too short."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ok, so it does have the smell of other movies/series in this genre. But it does stand alone in the amazing cinematography! It's incredible. The major sense I got in the beginning was firefly. It just has that homestead come sci-fi feel mixed with some chronicles of Rodrick and a pinch of Dune. It is a little slow in the beginning and I felt myself drifting a little. Also the bringing together of characters is slow. My major issue though is that when it finally started to get going and you settle in, it ends and as of writing this, we have about five months until the next part comes out. And by then it won't have the same impact. But I would like to feel that a new ""thing"" is being created here. I hope that this goes on to having its own universe with more depth to it, being learned. I won't spoil the story. I just wanted to give a feel for it. But definitely watch it. I look forward to watching it again around when the next part comes out"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Zack is a good guy however, he cannot write a story. This movie is so bland. All style over substance"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Completely unoriginal story,  scpit writter 
should be charged with plagiarism."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty good movie was it the best no but definitely enjoyed it and looking forward to the 2nd part 8/10 rating would prefer a bit more depth on each main character but overall a good experience ignore the hater critics they are seriously jaded
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie is terrible. Could be the worst movie I've ever seen. Stinky pile of poo.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Cringe acting - especially the protagonist, ridiculous fight choreography, really bad script and meh plot. Omg I'd rather watch paint dry‚Ä¶"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I want to like it, it looks nice, but none of it makes sense, no cohesion like this review, and the stilted acting from everyone but the villains made for a painful experience."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie with fantastic action scenes. A very good beginning for this new universe.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Oh dear! Stay away from this one. Nothing redeeming about it whatsoever.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible moon. The script was so shallow, uninspiring and predictable there was nothing left to do but turn this film off. I have seen more nuanced and interesting characters in children's story books. Graphics were over engineered making the set and style feel more like a video game than a film. Do no watch, spend your time better elsewhere"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Buena pel√≠cula de acci√≥n y ciencia ficci√≥n. Los momentos de c√°mara lenta uffff üòéüëç
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Had potential but this movie is corny as heck. 
They way she goes to these people to recruit them, she give some lame speech to the
convince them all to join her, it's lazy writing. 
Especially the speech to make the general join them, that was a terrible motivational speech. 
Not enough character development moved way too fast."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"No es un pelicul√≥n pero como entretenimiento zafa, ahora que la cr√≠tica le de solo 23 me obliga a hacer est√° Review enga√±osa pero con un poco de resentimiento a los cr√≠ticos pedorros besitos besitos chau chau!!"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining and the effects were well done.  A little slow in the middle but it picked up.  I look forward to part 2.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Tr√®s bon film. Pas parfait mais ne m√©rite pas les critiques qu'il re√ßoit. Quelques passage o√π l'on voit que la directors cut sera meilleure. Tr√®s bon moment pass√©
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good sci fi movie, better than last Star Wars and Star Trek production, but still Guardians of Galaxy on top."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The saving grace for me was Sophia Boutella & the character she plays. This film visually has so much potential, but story wise is chaotic & very poorly edited. Again, the only protagonist interesting is Kora (Sophia Boutella).."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"In the running for worst movie of the decade. *spoilers*
Consistently nonsensical plot. Characters introduced early then forgotten until the end of the film. Recruit a general, he's absent from all the planning, recruit rebels, immediately murdered. See informant captured, tell no on that their covers been blown.
Writing is equally amateurish. 20% of the film is poorly written monologues from the protagonist, ""she was named Issa after an ancient Queen, Issa the life giver. It was said she could give life"". Or a long monologue telling us about how she was ""adopted"" and raised to be a military officer. followed by ""at the age of 18 I was made an officer and given a command"" OBVIOUSLY, WE JUST WATCHED THAT HAPPEN OVER THE ENTIRE MONOLOGUE, WHY ARE YOU ALSO TELLING ME THIS????.
The whole film is scenes and tropes lifted from other media and pasted into Rebel Moon. 40k fake Latin and fancy uniforms, bad Mos Eisley Cantina ripoff, Jason Mimosa inspired Gryphon taming scene from Harry potter, Blades edge Mts ripped from Wow Burning Crusade.
Barf."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is awesome visually and I loved the characters. This world has so much to offer and expand on. Looking forward to part 2. It's a great sc-fi opera.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Good action and characters...
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Not usually a fan of films like this but this was an amazing watch can't wait for the next part.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,I look forward to watch part 2 ‚Ä¶ (Dune part 2)
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,So bad like worst parody of Star Wars...painful to watch...
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A tired plot with paper-thin characters, this is a film by numbers, each required element being checked off a list. It's 3 stars only for the visuals. Do something better with 2 hours of your life."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I enjoyed it as a first part and introduction to the characters and backstory. Looking forward to seeing where it goes for part 2.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a good film, who cares if it is similar to other movies. It would be almost impossible for it not to. I feel like it would have been better as a series though as it seems like there is not enough build up to have any empathy with the characters."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visuals were stunning! The story was quite interesting, did feel a bit slow in places but I felt myself paying attention the entire time. fight choreography was great too and felt real, and you did notice the slow motion after a while.

Was an enjoyable movie and am looking forwards to the directors cut of this"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved it. Very entertaining
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is why I don't ever listen to critics. They know absolutely nothing and I have no idea how they got the job.  This film was absolutely amazing. Best film I've seen in a long time, better than any star wars and I love those films."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very watchable, think the directors cut will be better as R rated would suit this movie better, otherwise, enjoyed."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely brilliant film. It's Star Wars for adults and I can't wait for part 2
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,It is like Star Wars and Warhammer 40K had a special needs child together
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a fun movie with some great cinematography....it's not a ground breaking story line as it borrows from other movies but most good movies do. Looking forward to the second part.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Is a great movie with very amazing visuals. Characters are so cool made, CGI at its best. The movie has nothing to do with Star Wars. The story is really good and is opening door to more parts. Only hating people will say is not a good movie.  I will definitely look forward to upcoming parts."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Its a beatiful scifi epos. Is it inovative? No. So what? Still great. Loved every second of it!
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,The was so much over use of slow motion that I thought my brain could suddenly slow time. CGI looked like a late 90s Fox television series.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is a hybrid between a comedy and a sci-fi trolling movie.
The way the movie is put together, it seems like a 4-year-old trying to copy the classics in a dumb way, stuff like Star Wars, 7 Samurai, Iron sky and copying parts of lore of videogames in an awful and tasteless way.
How people can appreciate this stuff is beyond me. I was able to go through the movie because the big budget gave some almost decent action scenes and some good actors."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Visuals outstanding, storyline was lacking, choppy and no character development."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it!   Fun, good entertainment. Really well done visuals. Waiting for the next installment"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Yes it really is that bad. Even before you get to the story, character development etc, you have to deal with out of focus scenes and patches of CGI that only just surpass Ant Man. Of a family of 4, that included a fresh out of uni film director, 3 of us were on our phones in less than 30 mins and the 4 unconscious."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Aside from some of the slow action sequences, the movie was pretty good. Looking forward to seeing part two."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I really liked it from the moment it started I was wrapped up in it. I can't wait for the next part definitely a must watch and am telling all the people I know it's definitely worth a watch!!!
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,essentially a hard to follow clip show.  Nothing in the plot to make you care about any of the characters although the main heroine might be worth fleshing out
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Hilariously bad. The dialogue is cringeworthy. Full of boring, poorly acted, humourless monologues. Even the action sequences are in slow motion, like some 90s student movie.  The visuals are however very impressive on the whole, it's just a shame they don't wrap themselves around a better movie.  All in all, we had a lot of fun laughing at how bad it all was, but seriously... They spent 170 million dollars on this... And that's actually not funny...."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Arguments are a little childish. You will not find original ideas in this movie; it's a mix of Seven Samurai, Star Wars, and any western movie.

Graphics are ok, but not enough to justify the script."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Instead of a single 2 hour movie, it should have been a 3 episode...regarding the story, it's great & uplifting. Amazing choreography, vfx, action & on point slo-mos...
The story is too good to be that short, felt like scenes were cut, which definitely were.."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Pulp si-fi with cliches and underdeveloped characters, but certainly not the disaster some would have you believe. Several things I've not seen before. I look forward to part 2. As a kid I used to wander down the si-fi aisle in bookstores, marveling at the fantastic cover art. Rebel Moon brings them to life!"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Mom can we have 40k

No we have 40k at home

This like ordering epic space movie from wish"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Akira Kurosawa's 7 Samurai meets Star Wars!
Awesome movie, can't wait for the R Rated version and Part 2."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's not so bad as some people want to make it out to be, I appreciate the effort to make a ""new"" IP‚Ä¶that said: ""slowmo"" is excessive and in most cases unnecessary, CGI is inconsistent, fight choreography should significantly improve, character development is minimal-to-none and characters don't have chemistry‚Ä¶leading to me not feeling for them when they get killed off, main character is bland at best, antagonists are far more interesting; it needed to be rated R to get the best out of it, unfortunately it's held back by the PG-13 rating that makes it convoluted in the editing room.

I'd watch the entire series, but it missed the mark in terms of being ""a new classic""."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Zack definitely delivers on epic fight scenes, some good visuals and strong character's but the world building is a little lack luster‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining and I really like the narrative of the story. Can't wait for part 2!
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,An attempt at grandiosity that rang unfortunately hollow.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I really love movie something new to watch Kora  the action is fun to me. if gave it 5 stars.  like the story
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely brilliant.  Great direction and awesome story.  Can't wait for part 2!
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Yes it has been inspired by many other movies but what movie hasn't. Just because there are tropes doesn't mean it's trite or hodgepodge. I judge movies by an emotional connection and it had that for me. The cast is insanely all hot but also not in the CW way; actually interesting and good acting. Highly recommend for fans of this genre.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Rather than pay the rights to use an existing IP, the writers of this film and the visual effects people borrow chunks from others from Judge Dredds (90s movie) lawgiver, to the space dreadnought from Homeworld 2 (game), to the style and language of the bad guys of the imperial guard (w40k) and story from numerous movies and particular another space movie battle beyond the stars, which had more originality and humour. I won't even go into the dodgy accents, are English actors still allowed to do Irish, and are we still doing the obvious evil empire as British?"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,An unnecessary show of visual gymnastics. Really
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Nowhere near a Starwars rip off. So good, I can't wait for the story to continue."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Rebel Moon continues Zack Snyders exploration of the heroes journey. As expected it is a visual feast. The storyline is relatively straightforward with a few surprises that appear along the way. I look forward to re watching this excellent film.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I lovedddd the movie!!!! I dont understand why people are criticizing it. My opinion is that this movie was phenomenal. It had me anxious and pumped the whole time. Waiting for second part
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Incoherent Star Wars ripoff.  I'd like the time I wasted watching it back.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it- but we needed more background-possibly in the Directors cut.
I found over 2 hours passed like 15 minutes. Really looking forward to the next part.

(reading the professional critics reviews- I wonder who these people are.
They get paid for writing guff?)"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It reminded me of the B movies that followed Star Wars, that wanted to be the new Star Wars but fell short."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,What's with the negative reviews? This movie was completely entertaining and production gold. It feels unfinished because it is unfinished üì£üì£üì£
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful cinematography, special effects, story, characters, universe, environments, just an epic movie, Masterpiece"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Who cares if it resembles Star Wars? This was a banger, visually stunning and action packed. Great fight choreography, soundtrack and special effects. Top ensemble with badass names: Tarak, Devra Bloodaxe, General Titus. Costumes and makeup on point. Loved it!"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Unlikable characters, hasty and disconnected narration. An embarrassing film."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was SUPER entertaining! We really enjoyed it
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What's worse than a movie that shamelessly plagiarizes elements from other sci-fi or fantasy products? A movie that does all this and fails to even build a world in which you feel interest and curiosity in finding out how the story will evolve. However, if the terrible world-building is Rebel Moon's biggest flaw, it certainly cannot be said that everything else is able to compensate for the extremely poor script. Direction, visual effects, photography, costumes are all so aseptic and unmemorable that it is guaranteed that nothing of this movie will remain forged in people's minds for years to come, as movies and TV series have been able to do like which Rebel Moon would pretentiously love to place itself."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A movie with forgettable characters, boring dialogue, no pacing, mediocre sfx, more lens flare than a J.J. Abrams.
I switched the film off after 97 minutes, as I had lost the will to live!"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"My thoughts on Rebel Moon:
1. Whoever said it's slow and has no character arch should visit their therapists ASAP!
2. 2 hours are not enough and might lack in proper editing
3. Sofia is a powerhouse
4. Direction's Cut will be the brilliant R Rated version we are all eating for"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A compelling setting with great visuals squandered by a cast of paper-thin characters and a soulless story. This movie attempts the classic Seven Samurai formula but fails to create compelling and likable characters. The film casts character development and plot cohesion aside to squeeze in as much action as possible, which might be a plus for some.

If you are looking for a mindless action film that allows you to turn your brain off and marvel at the gorgeous setpieces and action sequences, you will enjoy this film. If you are looking for a compelling narrative with a cast of lovable characters, you would be better off searching elsewhere."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"This has everything, a new story line, a new universe to get your teeth stuck into, characters to care about, visually it is stunning to watch and the time flew in watching it!! Can't wait for the extended version to see more!"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"By far one of the best most enjoyable and entertaining sci-fi movies I have seen in years, cant wait to see the extended uncensored cut and the second part, i loved it."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, I think am gonna have to rewatch it all over again."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Zack Snyder's ""Rebel Moon ‚Äî Part One: A Child of Fire"" an action packed seven samurai x spaghetti west space adventure movie"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It felt like a mediocre console game. The team recruiting, streamlined objectives with no parallel plots etc made me feel like I was watching a playthrough. At some point I was searching for a compiled list of stolen cliches from other franchises as they were so many. The visuals were decent thought, I'll give it that."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Long awaited Zack Snyder's new universe doesn't disappoint! Loved it from the beginning til the very end. Should've been R rated cut right away but hey, I'm still happy!"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,I really wanted to like it but it was so disjointed that it was in many sections almost nonsensical.  It was clear they knew they were doing a directors cut and so when they edited down this release it was not with an eye towards making it a coherent story.   Don't bother watching this version.   Wait for the extended addition and then decide if you'll watch the sequel.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Possibly the most derivative and unoriginal sci fi movie ever. Manages to rip off Star Wars, Dune, Avatar, and Harry Potter all in one movie!  In that regards I guess it is quite a. accomplishment."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the idea (even though clearly picks from many other movies)and the visuals. I think there is a lot of potential here but to be honest he felt a bit rush in the finale. Overal I liked it and looking forward to the second part.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Slow. Over done slow motion scenes. No character building, and  over hyped. Feels like a waste of time. Only thing good in the whole thing was the griffin scene. Everything else... flop in my opinion. Maybe if done as a series to allow more character development and story it'd been fine. Won't be watching part 2..."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I like new sci-fi IP
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is amazing, very captivating from beginning to the end. The story is so good, action and visuals are beautiful. Would definitely recommend everyone to watch it and experience it."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's not a masterpiece, it doesn't have to be, it entertains you for 2 hours, and despite all the rubbish I've seen in the cinema this year, I've been merciful here"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me ha encantado, tiene una historia interesante, muy buenos personajes, lo mejor es el universo y dise√±o de este, Muy a lo warhammer 40K, Tiene conceptos nuevos, el √∫nico defecto es quiz√°s el exceso de la c√°mara lenta, (me gusta la c√°mara lenta) pero creo que esto es mucho... Por lo dem√°s, es de lo mejor que se ha visto este a√±o a nivel cinematogr√°fico."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,This was an interesting movie. Things meets Clash of titans meets avatar. Nice world building (a little rushed) but exciting and interesting plot
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"A promising start to a new universe. 
Really enjoyed the world building and various people and places saw along the way. I think it's perfectly set up for an epic part 2 that will be the heart wrenching sci-fi war I've only ever dreamed of"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"The acting was good and great visuals. It borrows a lot from other SciFi movies, Star Wars in particular. However, it was entertaining and worth watching. Don't know why it has so many negative reviews. Looking forward to Part 2."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is entertaining from start to finish. This movie is Sci-Fi Fantasy.  The viewer expects to have some things left unexplained. That ok. We know it's make believe. We don't need a narrator to explain everything.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,The story has no soul. It's rushed and just another bloated CGI mess.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wow what a bad cheap version of Star Wars. People who loved it aredelusional, it was awful. CGI fest, empty dialogs. event that advance the plot because they are needed not because it makes sense. what a waste of time."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Simple story, lots of details, great visuals, first part feels like something was accomplished. Wanted to see more of Ray Fisher's character. Evil bad guy seems questionable. Loved fighting scenes."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"You know, I'm a fan of many movies and many directors, but most of all I'm a fan of good stories and good characters.  This has both.  Sure, there are some issues with battle scene slow motion (which personally I think can detract from the chaos and intensity of battle) but it's a minor niggle if the story works. It's also refreshing to have a story not beset by a big studio ""message"" or pandering to be relevant in today's society and just being a story.  It's a traditional story about empire stomping on those that it claims to protect, the things that real world rebellions have been caused by, but it's an enjoyable ride along with a band of characters and protagonists that left me wanting to see a) the next chapter and b), the extended r-rated version."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed this quite a bit and I'm excited to see what part 2 has to offer. Also, visually stunning film!"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"ZACK SNIDER DOES IT AGAIN! 
This movie was amazing. I normally don't watch gritty sci-fi, but I always want to give Zack a look expecting the movie to be okay, but I was surprised how engrossing the story is. The characters, the visuals and the settings top notch. And the villain is one of the most scary and gross villains I had seen on a while. The choice of weapon, a blunt object, makes him more sadistic and guttural. Very fresh way to present a villain in these sanitized times. Can't wait for the director's cut and the sequel."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"O filme est√° um pouco atr√°s de outros filmes do mesmo g√™nero ,  Mas n√£o √© um filme ruim consegui me divertir assistindo."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went into this blind about what it was and worried I'd roll my eyes into oblivion at the thought of a rip off Star Wars but was pleasantly surprised at the visuals, the plot, and the characters. Overall, I really enjoyed it."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entretenida, visualmente excelente."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The script is ancient, like a dinosaur era movie."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it. Can't wait for part 2.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is amazing.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Story was super basic. We all have seen it before. A mix of blade runner, Star Wars, Harry Potter, and Dune. CGI was too much and the slow motion was done way too frequently. No way this movie needed 2 parts"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie has several references, tries to be something, ends up being nothing."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I had to sign up and post for the first time on rotten tomatoes just to express how bad this movie is. I had only moderate hopes, but there just isn't anything redeemable about this movie."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Personally I don't think this movie should've been split into 2 movies, or at least the editing could be better.  Just from watching the preview of the of part 2, I get what I was missing from part 1: back story.  

All and all enjoyable watch.  Descent action and great cinematography.  Dialogue could've used some work. I don't get people bashing on the tropes and retelling of Seven samurai.  Everything has been done and most stories are told, we have tropes for a a reason. I thought it was a fresh take on the story. That being said, it was just cut and edited all wrong.  Maybe the rated R cut will be better."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,This was too rushed. Would have been better as a tv series where each character was fleshed our considering how dynamic they are.  Great cast but poorly executed.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,La experiencia de Zack esta pel√≠cula es el punto medio entre Star Wars y Warhammer 40k.  Espero la segunda parte.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely Snyders best work to date a must see
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's an OK action fantasy movie.  Nothing ground-breaking for the story line so far (Seven Samurai based).  Some of the character development scenes seemed excessive or just filler, but maybe there is some pay-off in Part 2.  The character story I'm most interested to see if anything develops is actually the droid."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty awesome movie. Watched it with my partner and we both loved it. She loved the aliens and I loved the subtle Star Wars hints of what could've been.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I enoyed the show. Great visuals the story is good enough to keep my interest. Looking foward to the extented version and to part 2.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,There's only one way to describe it. Dull.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"How did this even get made? There's so much wrong it's not even possible to enumerate it here. Is it sci fi, is it fantasy-- who knows. Worse, who cares."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Please do not waste your time watching this film. The plot is horrible, the acting is atrocious, and it's basically a rip off of every sci-fi movie there ever was - there were even orcs and hypogriffs. I wanted this to be so much better than it was."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you are a fan of sci fi movies, this is a must."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a wonderful story with wonderful characters and actors.  Visually \, it was very strickling, and I look forward to the second part. I don't believe the critics gave it a fair review."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"De las mejores pel√≠culas que vi este a√±o y punto.
Me encant√≥ el desarrollo de la trama sin tantos rodeos, no se siente pesada la pel√≠cula de 2 horas con 11 minutos, me hizo recordar mucho a mi infancia las pel√≠culas de como el actor principal iba a buscar a los personas secundarios que usualmente son unas bestias para pelear tambi√©n me record√≥ al se√±or de los anillos en la trama.
Le fall√≥ un poco en los efectos especiales los fondos algunos s√∫per fakes eso me disgust√≥ un poco pero los puedes superar con todo lo de m√°s que est√° s√∫per bien hecho. 
Los vestuarios, de 10 de igual manera los moustros los animales. Buen√≠simas la verdad la recomiendo much√≠simo la pel√≠cula de rebel moon."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is as expected    It is good.  It felt quick.    It's part one and it plays like a part one.   You want to watch part 2 when it's over.   It's like good Star Wars.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Visually impressive, and generally entertaining. There was potential for this movie to be one of the best science fiction movies in a long time. It started strong, and had compelling characters, but then it all started to feel rushed. New characters were introduced like we already knew their backstory--and were immediately trusted by the protagonists without question. There is an overwhelming Star Wars theme throughout--from the villain emerging from near death, to bar scenes, and the hero rising from a modest farming community. What saves this movie is the visuals, action sequences, and there is nothing that is noticeably terrible, like dialogue, or massive plot holes. It definitely would have benefited from pacing, character development, and a longer runtime. They should made this into a limited series."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent fantasy and sci fi flick. If you're looking for dramatic acting in the sense of Opemhiemer, this ain't it, but if you want an escape from reality and a couple hours with sheer visual and conceptual delight, this meets all those points. Thank you Zach for not making movies for critics and in turn giving your fans something to delight in. 
One more thing, I'll never watch movies because some stuffy nose that thinks they know better tells me what is enjoyable."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The
 storyline reminding me too much of an old show called Battle beyond the Stars. The special effects were actually pretty lame and acting really was flat. It was really a big disappointment, I will not be wasting my time watching the next episode when it comes out later this year"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great FILM! 

Need more films of warriors showcasing their abilities and fight scenes!"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Stunning visuals, new interesting worlds and characters to explore. Excited to see part 2."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,An overwrought but mildly entertaining mashup of Seven Samurai and every worn-out sci-fi trope imaginable. Nothing new to see here.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the worst sci-fi movies I have ever seen. The entire story is disjointed and fails on so many levels. It is like bad Star Wars fan fiction if the fan had never watched Star Wars and confused Star Wars with Star Trek but wanted to make a space opera with lots of slo mo parts of battle sequences.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved every minute it. Yes, there are elements of Star wars, dune, and others. But in this day and age the basic plots of all movies are the same. The story fits well into the classic heroes journey."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I've seen and enjoyed a lot of bad sci-fi movies. But the only enjoyable thing about this movie is the costume and set design. The heavily used CGI is okay I guess, it's at least passable. All the excitement of the action scene is snuffed out by over used slow motion. The acting is wooden and you can easily forget characters in the main crew. Worst of all, the movie is just predictable and boring with, what characters you barely remember, being moved along by the plot. I would say the movie is all edge, no point but there's not even an edge to the movie."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic movie! I don't understand all the hate to be honest‚Ä¶
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked everything about it.  It had me hooked from start to finish. Action packed! I am looking forward to part two of this movie.  The critics go it wrong!
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"An world and story full of potential, but intrigue is lost when the it started to feel formulaic. The start of the film had me interested in the world and Kora, the main character. But as she goes on a venture to recruit an army, it turns into a predictable structure of ""land on planet, observe a character overcome a great feat, and have them join the crew for no convincing reason."" This would have been a better format if done as a series with 8-10 episodes. If each episode could have been spent on a planet, exploring the lore, culture, races, and laws of that world and making us care about the character that's eventually recruited, it would have been way more impactful by the end of the season. But rather, when the big fight happens at the end of the film, I had little to no investment into the characters (at times I couldn't even recall their names), therefore, I have no reason to care who lives or dies. I just simply watched it feeling next to nothing.
It had good graphics, but while the battle scenes look nice, they cut into slow motion so often and at times that felt unneeded, that it made the battles feel too long. It also fell into the same trap that we see in action movies, where no one, despite being trained soldiers, can aim their guns properly, or hit their targets if their lives depended on it (and yes, their lives DID depend on it.) Of course, our main character and her crew had exceedingly good luck with their aim. :S
Thankfully, the ending of the film left me intrigued and wanting to tune in for Part 2. If only the middle of the film was as strong as the start and end, it would be near perfect. Unfortunately, the thought of sitting through this film a second time is not a thought I'll be having anytime soon."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"By Zach Snyder‚Ä¶.ok, decent visuals but has struggles trying to determine if its a cheap Star Wars knock off with a Mix match of Viking, western, pirates, nazis genres all jumbled together ‚Ä¶.oh and a Supreme Emporer.  Like i said decent visuals but not sure i waste time eagerly awaiting part 2 . üßê"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is such a waste of talent, the definition of clich√©, with cero tensi√≥n in every scene."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"good movie overall & visuals were incredible as usual, zack never misses"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wow, that dragged in so many places.
Has no one talked to them about pacing?
Waste of potential, that cast deserves better, what a slog.
Thankful for the fast forward button."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was entertaining, interesting and fun. Looking at some of the reviewer scores (and comments) reminded me of the Simpons episode where Homer writes scathing restaurant reviews. If you like this genre then definitely give if a watch, if not then you won't enjoy it regardless. That said I don't believe reviewer scores accurately reflect anything these days and you're better off giving it a go yourself, or asking someone with similar taste in movies for their opinion."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Reminds me of a made for TV movie, i don't think its supposed to be a comedy, but all i did was laugh at everything.  Its not even interesting, i just wanted all the characters to die lol"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I dunno what everyone is bitching about... i had fun ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Good dose of sci fi action.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"First of all. As usual, when the critics dislike a movie. I want to watch it. Rebel Moon was Awesome !!!!!!! I have noticed since the Trump era, when one critic dislikes a movie, the rest of the critics pile on like vultures. To say Rebel Moon is spoof of Star Wars. Then Star Wars and every other sci-fi is a spoof of Star Trek."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Derivative and a bit hokey. Reminded me of 1980 Flash Gordon but less fun. Good guy takes out a space ship with a spear lol.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a REALLY good movie. Give it a watch. Idk what these critics are talking about. It captivated my attention, like I stopped eating my sandwich at certain scenes cause I was that hooked"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Poetry in motion, a must see for everyone and definitely the best Christmas present!"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I dont understand all the hate. I think it was very good. It has one job: to tell an entertaining story. It accomplished this job and fairly well. It truly did. The acting was fabulous. The sets were very well done. Production value was high. Bonus: it was also free. Yes, the story is not particularly original, but what story is?  The good versus evil plot is an ancient one retold many times. Kudos not codemnation are in order. If you notice it was the critics who rated it so low. The audience seems to rate it at almost a 70%.  I am always suspicious of those who do not  create anything, yet judge those who do with vitriol. SMH."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Is it cheesy? Definitely. Some parts are a little rough, and there's definitely a requirement for suspension of disbelief. Soooo many storylines that felt shorter than they could've been, but I wanted more. Special effects were very, very fun. Thoroughly enjoyable. Looking forward to part 2."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Far from perfect,  but also refreshing fun in many ways."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Had potential.  Visually it's beautiful, but it lacks depth. The characters are 2d...really don't like them. They lack almost any redeemable qualities.  And really annoyed at them waiting to have the ""rated R"" version...so stupid..."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Some characters don't really get fleshed out enough, and the pacing can be a little jumpy at times, but Rebel Moon builds an incredible universe, with complex motivations for its core cast, satisfying action sequences and does a good job of resolving its own conflict while building towards Part 2. Very enjoyable watch."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, only wish we had the R-Rated version at launch. The only sad thing is it's too short. I really wish we had the uncut 3h version right away to see the full lenght in details of this movie. 

Overall a great experience, the cast is great and deliver a great performance, The pacing is great we're toss into the thick of the movie within minutes. 

A great space opera!"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very paint by numbers story that cant decide if it wants to be Star Wars or Dune.  Foreshadowing is non existant and a quick speech is all it takes to get people to join her crew.   No character development and too much slo motion.  Skip this one.  Watch it if you dont like bright colours cause there is so much brown.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"There were story elements I recognised for sure, it's a sci-fi hero movie with a pretty big nod to Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven, and various other franchises... but so what.
The FX were well done, the fight scenes had a Riddick vibe (the whole slo-mo thing)... the score was epic, if a bit light on themes.... some of the dialog was a bit ""obvious"".
But as a world builder, leaving questions (as it should)... pretty good.
So, in the grander scheme of things, did I enjoy it? Yes
Am I looking forward to the next part, did I finish this one wanting to see more? ... 100% yes."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Our family loved it! We can't wait for part 2!
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Out of focus, unoriginal, unwatchable. Dull, muddy visuals & the slo-mo... All the slo-mo... She even drops the grain in slo-mo. I couldn't tell if the writer/director needed Ritalin or if he'd OD'd on it."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Great visuals & stunning world!
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is a rip off of other movies of course StarWars,Dune,Matrix,Bladerunner,Judge Dredd and 300. (But I guess 300 doesn't count). Very hokey,predictable, and porn has a better dialogue. Too much spent on FX and not on writing except for the ships they just looked stupid. Don't waste 2 hours of your time."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolute garbage. I couldn't finish it, not could my daughter, a lot younger than me. A complete, unoriginal rip-off of countless other movies. Don't waste your time."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good action movie with a straight forward Empire vs underdog story . The rag tag group of protagonists is a good mix of a hero, the forgotten, the lost and the rebels. I see a lot of bad scores but I give it an 85%. It wasn't Empire Strikes Back but it sure as hell wasn't WaterWorld either ‚Ä¶. LOL üòÇ"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,A straight forward movie and keep me glue to the screen entire duration. Cant wait for part 2.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie gives a different aspect of a star wars trilogy. More violence and an indepth view of each character. I enjoyed every turning moment. Id say a dune meets star wars with a very strong passionate leading lady. Fantastic CGI and the Characters are very interesting. I loved every pulse pounding moment. All you die hard star wars fans get into a new generation away from that trilogy. Not a rip off. A rip forward.  Rotten tomatoes doesn't do this movie justice. I loved it and I want more!
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Kind of like Seven Samurai of the stars. It's watchable enough.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Mediocre, big-scale nonsense delivered with laughable amount of slow-mo and corny dialogues. Thankfully, we have Star Wars from George Lucas."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not derivative, just downright plagiaristic. Visually exhausting, yet boring."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I didn't know the history of this movie.  I just happened to see it trending and watched.   The visuals are outstanding and choreography of fights was good.   I like the and of misfits with no hope idea focusing on each heroes story.   The acting was good and the story has me wanting to see the sequel.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have no clue what the so called ""professional"" critics are smoking this movie is perfection absolute must watch can't wait for director cut"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Predictable and cliched, but enjoyable. Wish there was better character development, but that would have made part 1 too slow. Looking forward to part 2"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Spectacular cinematography and one of the best villains to hit the screen in a long time. Can't wait for more!
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,really liked the whole cast ........ 'cept ed strein. becoming a big fan of sophia also. looking forward to Dir. cut!
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's pretty to look at but it's not very good.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,The time spent on totally unnecessary slowmo would have been better used developing the characters. It feels like a huge waste of big potential. At every corner you get the feeling of a rich and interesting world only to be fed cliches and a predictable story with some major plot holes.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was almost better than the flash.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I don't mind clich√© so long as it's still a compelling overall story, this film borders on unwatchable due to its paint by numbers script."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really deserves 4 stars, but people seem to get off on hating this movie, so tried to counter that with a 5 star. It's enjoyable, looks pretty, and makes me want to see Part II. It's not groundbreaking, but it doesn't need to be. Sometimes it's ok for a movie to just be enjoyable."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a fine movie.  Not horrible, not great.  You can watch it and not be angry you watched it.  The characters weren't set up very well, couldn't care if they loved or died."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,I think the reviews are overly harsh. I enjoyed this movie and hope to see Part 2.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie is long, with very little character development. While visually pretty at times, they don't stay in any one place long enough for you to really explore the area. The dialogue is laughable, with one scene in particular the main character is trying to convince another person to join her team and the things she says are so bad I began laughing out loud as she spoke the lines. It is a straight up remake of the seven samurai, I'm not sure where the articles claiming it's an original story get that idea from... in seven samurai, you have japanese farmers searching for samurai to defend their village from raiders stealing their rice... in Rebel Moon, you have... space farmers.... searching for space warriors.... to defend their village from an empirial admiral stealing their wheat...."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What did I just watch. Hollywood directors need to go train in Japan and learn how to create good films again. The plot was boring and predictable. The acting was sub par. They really wasted the talent they had. And the main character was just horrible, just about everyone else in the film was more believable than her and had a better story arc. Very poorly executed project."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was kind of a mess. The plot was paper thin which I mean is fine for a B sci fi flick but it was so choppy. From the outset it didn't flow at all. We start on a farm where we have our hero and possibly two ""unlikely allies"" that never show up again for whatever reason but were made to seem important (yes I'm aware there's more parts but at least make it make sense). The giant exposition dumps from our main heroin were bad. Go into the ""recruitment phase"" for this little adventure and it just felt like it just jumped from one planet to the next without truly fleshing out any of the characters for real. So you didn't actually care why they were joining this crew. The abilities they had to aid in this ""rebellion"" didn't really make any sense. We had a farmer, a grifter, a wannabe anime female assassin type, a retired drunken general, and some random barbarian types because why not. If I missed anyone else it was because they were just THAT forgettable. ALL of the fight sequences save for one in the bar were awful (typical stormtrooper fodder minus the fun). The sad part is I found the background characters that had like one scene infinitely more interesting than the main cast. A lot of slow mo when it wasn't necessary. In fact in the final fight the slow motion made this big ""hero moment "" of one of the characters look like he was straight out of Team America: World police. That actually got a laugh out of me. TLDR: It was a mess, the characters sucked and if I didn't know that it was taking itself seriously I would have thought it was a parody."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I've never written a movie review.  I had thought about writing a movie and now I think I definitely can. Just do a bunch of drugs, watch as much anime,fantasy and sci-fi as possible and maybe not sleep. You will have rebel moon. Characters from gladiator to mad max fury road. Toss in a few light sabers, spider people and hobbits(orcs wtv tf) also. I cannot believe this movie was produced without any production company or studio suing the producers or whomever.  I have seen it once and do not plan to ever again. I felt like there was a hidden prize you would win if you could guess every movie, tv show or anime they ripped off (if there is please let me know). Unfortunately I will still have to watch part 2 to laugh at all the other sh* they copied."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Would love to get an extensive series if possible!
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a fun movie! Lot of actions and cinematography was great! Excited for Part II.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,A series of beautiful images barely strung together with a nonsensical plot. This self indulgent film feels like a poorly written video game from 2009.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie. The experts,  ""critics"" are wrong again!"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was a fun action packed movie.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,A rough movie to watch. No thank you on part 2.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Could have been better. Pretty much a retelling of The Seven Samari's
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Overall the film is probably not bad. From the category that you watched once with mixed feelings, you either regret wasted time or not. But in any case, there will definitely be no desire to review this film for the next 70 years.
People didn't bother with the script at all. Later I looked at what the scriptwriters had created earlier and realized that for their level this was normal, but it's not clear how Zach got there... I hope by mistake. The interest in the plot is about the same as in the first Mario Brothers game on the third playthrough - everything is linear, without any developments in the narrative. You can start watching from the middle of the film and nothing will change at all."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was immersed into the story line immediately, wonderful cinematography and music. 
Incredible sci fi fantasy. One of the best I've seen in a long time ! MUST SEE !!!"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A sad re-skinning of other movies. It's like he took script pages from other Sci-fi and Fantasy films and randomly threw them together. About the only non-boring joy the movie can bring is guessing which movie he's stealing which scene from. Oh, that's a New Hope, followed by Harry Potter meets How to Train Your Dragon, even a dose of the original Frakenstien, but everything is simply stolen from something else."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"La primera mitad de la pelI se la pasan contando cosas que deber√≠an mostrarte en escenas ES UNA PEL√çCULA, si quiero imaginar la acci√≥n mejor me leo un libro, las segunda parte se entiende que deben usar el tiempo que queda para mostrar a los nuevos personajes pero... ¬øy luego que? pr√°cticamente ni interactuan entre si ¬øcomo vamos a empatizar con ellos para cuando caigan en la segunda pelicula? y el problema ya desde ah√≠ es que reci√©n cuando despega la pel√≠cula ya estamos en el final.
Sin contar el tremendo guionazo que se lanzan al final, cuando el personaje de Ray Fisher derriba una NAVE ESPACIAL usando una LANZA de metal, la cual solo le da a un artillero y no a un piloto, destrozando en el acto un vidrio dise√±ado para cruzar la atm√≥sfera y derribando un destructor.
Usa c√°mara lenta hasta para enfocar granos de ma√≠z dos veces en la misma escena...
Si no puede contar una historia en menos de 3 horas mejor que se dedique a hacer series, que ah√≠ le va a sobrar el tiempo para meter relleno y las escenas en c√°mara lenta que quiera."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,My family and I loved playing the game where we guessed where each part of the movie was stolen from which other franchises! Omg this movie was so bad! I understand you have to suspend some disbelief but this was asking me to be almost mentally deficient to follow along. The dialogue seems to have been written by chat gpt. The female lead was a complete Mary Sue and I've seen better acting in middle school plays. I will schedule my future lobotomy before watching part 2.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good movie.  I could definitely see this in the SW universe. High attention to detail. Very good acting, special effects. 
Good story line along 7 samurai.
Excited for party 2."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Super hero femme fatal dodges 10,000 lasers kills everyone in over used slow mo in this perverse for no reason poorly written D-leauge Warhammer want to be."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I Iiked the movie. 
It's perhaps misunderstood by most critics as some kind of ""drama"" so they've reviewed it as such.
It's not though, it's a Sci Fi action movie.
The action is great! The weapons and cybernetics and combat choreography are really well made.
Explosions are cool.
The acting is good, what there is of it. The story is adequate for what it's supposed to be for the genre."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Poderia ter sido uma s√©rie. Faltou tempo pra desenvolver os personagens, a montagem n√£o tava boa, cortes sem sentido. Eu gosto da c√¢mera lenta do Zack mas acho poderia equilibrar melhor colocando cenas normais com mais tempo de tela, √© muito tempo de tela pra c√¢mera lenta, mas o problema mesmo do filme √© a falta de desenvolvimento, poderia ter sido uma s√©rie e mostrado melhor como foi o encontro de cada personagem e mostrado a hist√≥ria de cada um. Corrido demais, visuais bons, cenas de luta muito boas mas faltou uma montagem melhor."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love the movie. It definitely borrows a lot from other sci-fi movies out there, but you already know that. I love the storyline used. Does a very good job of keeping my interest.  Definitely recomend."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was not bad as the critics say, cant wait for part 2."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie feels like it's been written by an 8 year old. No substance, incredibly dumb characters. At least in 300 the action varanted slow motion, here every little thing is in slow motion. People get stabbed left and right yet there is no blood, the PG-13 rating is little silly with this amount of fighting and people dying left and right."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Id never heard of this movie so I went in with low expectations.  It still disappointed.  Poor clich√©d script mediocre acting and large budget special effects.  The constant oration kills the pacing and makes the movie drag.  I'd probably be happy to find this on the Sci Fi network at 1 am.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed these movie. In fact, I enjoyed it enough I came here to leave a review which I never do. It does have some violence but it felt ok for my 13 year old. "
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great visuals! A bit more of character development would have been nice, but of course there's limitations to movies as opposed to series. A strong start for a new saga."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"There are fun moments but so many things that just take you out of the story. This movie is loaded with great actors but due to there being such a massive cast you don't really get attached to anyone. They try to give some back story as they assemble the team but it feels very forced. I also hope you like slow motion because we sure know Zach does. ANY kind of action scene there will be a multiple slow motion cuts - while yes, these are cool and he does a great job; there are so many it just gets old. It's like being forced to eat cake at every meal; it's great at first but starts to quickly loose its appeal. There isn't a glaring ""horrible thing""; it's a fun sci-fi movie and it is what it's meant to be‚Ä¶.but they try to layer so many things into the movie you just don't find it particularly interesting."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I thought the movie was good. It held my attention; I felt the characters were compelling, as was the story. Admiral Noble is quite the villan. Arthelius/Kora is a strong protaganist. the movie reminds me of Putin vs. Ukraine."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Good overall movie...decent script with great cinematography. My only real complaint is that it is 1 of only 2 parts...should be a limited series to flesh out the characters a bit more.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Pel√≠cula DECEPCIONANTE... Unos buenos visuales no cambiar√°n el gui√≥n tan MALO que lleva la historia.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It tries too much to be epic at every scene and dialogue, get cheesy and boring."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entertaining. The scene were epic..can't wait for the directors cut..at least the bad guys can shoot (not like stormtroopers)
Refreshing after ep8 and 9 dissapointment
Can't wait for part 2"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie.. decent pace, storyline could have been a little more R rated. Otherwise it's okay."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is tragedy‚Ä¶ unnecessary and overused slow motion ‚Ä¶ The script (dialogue) seems to be written by a child and the acting compliments that. Snyder's lack of clear vision showed through the characters bouncing back and forth between western, Viking , and Irish accents/customs. The lead is suppose to be a battle hardened badass but she looks scared and indecisive the entire time. The big bad villain (imperial) is poorly explained and the flashbacks are more awkward than insightful. Lastly the fight scenes‚Ä¶. Let's just say Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy in the heat fight scenes are better and more believable."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No plot, no character development, too many slow motion shots, very average vfx. No thanks"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie, excited for the next one!"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"While Rebel Moon borrows from a lot of Sci-Fi tropes, it really failed to deliver a compelling and riveting story. Visually, this movie is a wonder to see and it has that Warhammer 40k aesthetics to it. However the execution of the story ruins it by giving us characters with no personalities and makes us believe that they would easily band together with very little effort. It is unfortunate that this movie will heavily rely on the next chapter in order for it to be considered whole. Most movie series that are considered to be top tier have held their own with each movie. Each movie should have its own separate arc that will culminate at the conclusion, sadly for this movie, it will rely on the next installment (Scargiver) for it to be considered digestible. 

The good: visually amazing and I really love the concept

The bad: execution of the movie is lackluster, the pacing is terrible and the characters not interesting enough.

The ugly: overuse of slow motion. Not every action sequence needs a slow motion. For the love of God, Zack, stop it."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely a blast. I am baffled by the disconnect between the critics and the actual people.
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't even know why people pay attention to critic reviews anymore. Yes while you get Star War vibes the concept was cool, graphics were fun and the story is dramatic yet entertaining.  What happened to just enjoying a good movie with family. Everything is oh they didn't do this or I expected that. It wasn't trash it was creative and most films nowadays aren't as original is they use to be, but that doesn't mean you can't just smile while watching. If you want to write and create a script and see if it can make a movie, go for it. So be light-hearted on the reviews lol, especially hard-core critics."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Perfect amount of sci-fi and action. No corny love story, but would have enjoyed a little of chemistry or romance some type. Vibes: The chronicles of Riddick mixed with Star Wars. Chefs Kiss!"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Filme muito ruim, roteiro muito fraco, c√¢mera lenta o tempo todo"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's beautiful. The design. The scenes. The costumes. There's little characterization for characters we are supposed to expect. The acting isn't great. The plot is very simple and I had little to no care about it. I just wished it was better. Feels like it's all been done before and done better. Beautiful but no substance.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring and filled with tropes you've seen a million times before. The lead hero's planet was wiped out by the big baddie who then adopted her and she became a great warrior who will turn on him. Sound familiar? Action is horrible, slow-mo adds nothing to this film but director uses it more than lens flare in the rebooted Star Trek"
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent storyline. I eagerly am looking forward to Part to and others.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's rushed and doesn't have much time to breathe, but it got me interested in this universe, and I'm definitely planning to check out the R-rated cut."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked it.  A good B movie space epic with some great action scenes.  Most of cast is great, however disappointed in treatment of Ray Fisher and Charlie Hunman's characters!! And Corey Stoll wasted.  Special mention to Anthony Hopkins.  Film owes A LOT to Star Wars and even some Doctor Who however opening scene brought to my mind Gone With The Wind and if you're seen both you'll know what  I mean.  I look forward to Part 2."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"The film is incredible, I liked the setting, actors, acting, scenery, costumes and photography. Excellent film."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie is basically 7 samurai but set in space. I was looking forward to this movie. But it just didn't live up to the hype. The plot armor the heroes have along with the low tier acting not even its amazing visuals can redeem this.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,I don't know what this is but it is not good
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie and it leads to even better movies in the future!
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Un inico aceptable , pero te deja con mas.
Un grupo que no se siente sus motivaciones,
Mala pelicula? noo , 
Se esperaba mas ? Si.
Tomando en cuenta a cr√≠ticos que premian bodrios y payasadas que te hacen reir como algo bueno , esta por encima de eso."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,very solid üëå zach delivers a damn good film
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It had good action scenes but no real plot. I'd like them to develop the characters more. Also, they should have released parts 1 and 2 at the same time. It might make a difference on how it's rated"
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,Absolutely horrible in every sense of the word.
"Dec 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"There is no denying that the film is derivative, but I disagree with reviewers who say it is only derivative of Star Wars, Dune, or other large Sci-Fi franchises. I think it is mostly derivative of samurai films and retellings of the Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven, set in space. If you have liked many of the retellings of that classic story,  you may enjoy this. The visuals are stunning, and although the dialogue is a little wooden, it certainly isn't more wooden than George Lucas' dialogue. I didn't particularly care for the Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron ""noble savage"" element and really wish they could have given the actor a shirt, but overall I liked the film and will watch the second half."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,Superb starting point of what could be an excellent universe. I just want more!
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't get the hate on this movie, It was good."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Rarely I am compelled to review a film, but this film is awful. There have been many movies attempting to emulate Star Wars, this being with this being a terrible tribute.

So many plot holes, no character development, forced dialogues with weak monologues, poor acting (not all) , and unnecessary slow mo's .

The cinematography is nice, but everything feels forced. So many scenes are unbelievable and unnecessary and and obvious 'copy and paste' from previous versions.

I assume the next films will fill in the details, but in reality I don't want to waste Time my time with them.

Overhyped but I'm sure Ladbible will make sure it's popular."
"Dec 24, 2023",POSITIVE,the best we've had on interplanetary war themes in recent times. I hope Star Wars gets back on track
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One of Snyders's favorite authors is Ayn Rand, and they have something in common. They are both TERRIBLE writers who write unrealistic characters."
"Dec 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,I love sci fi and waited expectantly for Rebel Moon.The ludicrous premises are too many to write here. Put together like an anthology of stupidity and unbelievability. Zack should be ashamed. Unwatchable.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,This was the worst movie I've ever seen.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,This was really awful. Painfully ridiculous. Consider turning off the sound and just watching the visuals.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very much 300 in space.  Only not as good
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visually stunning shallow retelling of the seven samurai. Comically evil villans dispatched with ease by our 90lb girl boss. 
Shallow and boring while being Visually appealing is about all I can say about it."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun scifi action flick to watch.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If you are looking to watch a good movie, this ain't it! Visually can be stunning but the dialogue is terrible, acting is very wooden plus the pacing is worst that I have seen. The fact that it is compared to star wars is laughable."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Though it takes some ideas from other Space Operas, this is not a bad thing. It has clear direction, paced world-building, near-perfect casting, and a plot loose enough to let the characters breathe organically. 

When the group is being recruited, there are two clich√©d scenes, which could have been more tactful. I imagine in the Director's cut that they will be. 

Following in the footsteps of Star Wars, Dune, and Foundation, Rebel Moon is a fun and exciting ride, with exposition enough to tickle the fancy of any true Science Fiction fan. 

I am excited to see where the sequels take us. I have my ticket and some popcorn at the ready!"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Come on ! This movie is not that bad. Your expectation and the hype around the movie made you think it's bad. But honestly, if try being objective, this movie is pretty good. Visually beautiful, story nothing exceptional, but good enough to make me want to see the second part. This is not the movie of the year for sure, but still better than any movie Disney has done lately ..."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a really good Sci Fi movie.

Redemption is always going to be a winner, and a few good people facing insurmountable odds is the stuff heroism is made of.

I've yet to see what creative work critics have accomplished. All they do is tear down what they cannot do."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautifully shot film , great action !! Wish it was longer so we got some more story but maybe the R rated cut will fill this void. But soo excited for part 2"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun space action adventure! The fact that critics are flogging it just shows what a bunch of pretentious wankers they all are.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The Part 01 is a Ok Movie at maximum, nothing new, nothing good. Just a Ok Movie."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,A original stand alone adaptation off of the Star Wars saga. People will knock it for that but it has the feel and power of it without drawing you towards something else. It has great graphics and a overall powerful sense of good vs evil that empowers the mind and soul.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Found it a good movie, I went in with low expectations because of the critic reviews but found it enjoyable.  NOT anywhere near Star Wars but a fun to watch at home. Just hope the next one is better with the dialogue and storytelling. Has potential to be a good trilogy if quality increases"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I really love this movie!!!
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing story, cast, and visuals. Can't wait for part 2"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing film and an amazing cast. Well done Zack on this intergalactic masterpiece
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very fun and entertaining movie. Not a surprise critics didn't like it, typical really. This isn't the next lord of the rings but honestly compared to the movies released over the last 3 years it's one of the best ones."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Pretty standard sci-fi movie.  Not great, not bad.  A good weekend or rainy day movie."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Just another poorly written, mediocre acting, and even worse directing movie. Amazing concept though. Interesting worlds and animals. Just a shame it was so subpar in the end. Hopefully part 2 is much better."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Story wasn't that interesting and CGI was pretty bad.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great acting, wonderful world building, i did wish it was longer. Complaining about a space opera not being mind blowingly original is asinine."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good start with a new universe. Should get better from here
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Gostei do filme. N√£o √© a nova maravilha do mundo mas diverte, boas cenas de a√ß√£o, v√°rias referencias a warhammer e star wars."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"waaay to much slow motion... there is clear a biger concern in special effects and impact scenes than with the story itself.
the excessive slow-mo is a really bad habit in Snider movies, and the level of excess is really annoying. The excess get to the point where there¬¥s scenes in super slow-mo inside slow-mo scenes! argh!"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"1 star because it's a beautiful film to look at, but that's it. The writing is just god awful and only barely hangs in there supported by an A list cast."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,See our non spoiler review on X & YouTube. @ZaneandCat
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great visuals and action scenes.  Character development and dialogs are missing.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I am so disappointed.   With all the hype this turned out to be a dud.    The action subpar- to much slow motion and there is no depth to the characters.   The dialogue seems to be written by a teenager. The only saving grace is Ed Skrein.    He is the only one who is does any decent acting.    
Sofia Boutella is not believable as some sort of super warrior.    
Tragic acting by Djimon Hounsou.    He over acts and seems to force his lines.   
Don't waste your time."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I wanted this movie to be good, but it's not. The first 30 minutes could have easily been cut down due it a lot of it being unnecessary, every fight scene was 80% slow motion for the sake of slow motion, and the characters are very flat. This cast is loaded and they deserved better."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Just add 20 more mins and give us a proper intro, followed by a bit more depth then the super-obvious plot line - Could've really been a solid start to the new franchise. Instead, it's a solid waste of time."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Actually great idea. But i do believe the DC would flesh it out more as it feels short. 2, hours is not enough for all the cool concepts expressed. That does not make it a bad film of course. I'm excited to see where the next part takes us."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Really bad acting. It's just a bad rip off of all different movies but we no feeling. It is so predictable. Like it was written by ai after watching loads of sci-fi and then told to write a movie using all these movies.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's exactly what the director said it was: Seven Samurai in space. Or another way of putting it, Magnificent Seven meets Star Wars. It's very entertaining! Love the casting and the lead, Sofia Boutella. Think Naksu meets Rita Vrataski. Part 1 has a dystopian atmosphere and focuses mainly on recruiting rebel fighters, with some battles here and there to keep it exciting. It sets up Part 2 nicely. It's good Sci-fi!"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Utter garbage. 
Poor green screen effects, laughable dialogue delivered by D-list actors and a plot that makes little sense."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie has more in common with his 2002 Dawn of the Dead, in that this movie just didn't die. You think it's over, but no, it keeps going. Not that the visuals weren't unimpressive, they were. However the dialogue, the story, its a 2 hour movie with 90 mins of exposition. Were they ripping off Star Trek? Star Wars? Harry Potter? Villains too evil to possibly exist, is the main bad guy a space Nazi or a space peaky blinder? Too many locations, a cat with a beak stuck on it, terrible cgi, awful unlovable characters, predictable 'twists'"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great film. Little predictable, but very entertaining!"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Yes. There's plot holes, character development issues, and story beats that...seem to go nowhere. But I still REALLY enjoyed the film. Because for all of these negatives, it also did SO MUCH right. It gave us a rich, unique universe ripe for exploration. A well crafted, mysterious, competent main character that I want to keep following. Audio and Visuals that a distinctly their own, despite how many tropes and ideas were borrowed from other famous Sci-Fi stories like Dune and The Chronicles of Riddick. Everyone is quick to say this film rips off Star Wars, while seeming to forget that Star Wars was HEAVILY inspired by Flash Gordon and Dune.

I admired the objectively good set design, The stupendous score, And the sense of curiosity about where the story is going to go. And ya know what...I think the audience score on rotten tomatoes is right. 70% is COMPLETELY fair. This movie is without a doubt a 7/10. A flawed, yet intriguing first entry into a new franchise that has room to blossom into something that could last for years to come, or crumble under the weight of it's own talented, yet at times pretentious creator."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The action and graphics were EPIC!!!. Started slow with alot of story build up, but enough beautiful scenery to keep it going. The build up for the next movie is intense and I can't wait to see the next chapter. Don't listen to the critics on this one, this movie is great!"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Show don't tell. This movie ignores this rule completely. The characters don't even talk to each other except the protagonist. A lot of scenes just strung together. It's trash tier.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics are pretentious idiots who offer their self indulgent opinions that nobody cares about.  The movie does a great job of building a world and bringing its characters together for a common cause.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fuck yes! Totally buying what this flick is selling!  Fantastic action, sneaky good plot.  Can't wait for part 2 üòéü¶Ñ"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed the movie, and I am looking forward to Part 2."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great and high quality retooling of Seven Samurai. Fantastic characters, landscapes and a well paced and engaging story that already has me wanting Part Two! Don't believe the hater critics, see and judge for yourself!"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Synder just isn't very good I'm afraid. This movie is all over the place. 

And for those who consistently blame the producers, studios etc when he releases something bad. A good director knows how to negotiate with those people to get what you want."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I just watched a great movie and after seeing the critics i had an instant deja vu... it feels like Star Wars when the prequels were released.  You simply cannot please everyone.  I loved more the prequels than the sequels and seeing the criticism of Rebel Moon it seems that these are the same fans who hated the prequels when they were released.  It's such a great movie.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Think for yourself, the haters are gonna hate, i didnt think it was perfect but close to it and its probably the best movie of the year. it would take alot of money to make me talk bad about this movie.... hint hint disney... ill take 1 million $ to lie for you... but since they are not... I LOVE THIS MOVIE AND I CANT WAIT FOR MORE. this site is a joke for the reviews. please dont be a sheep and think for yourself."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually, it is a treat. The story line, regardless of what professional critics say, is compelling. Looking forward to the next part!"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Bad. Battlefield-Earth-bad.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it.  I was a little disappointed is wasn't a series, but I can't wait for the second half in April 2024.  I enjoyed the characters and like the choice of actors to play them."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it! Cant wait for Part 2!!
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,he's very good with visuals but his stories are boring and his characters are flat. The best movies he's done were stories from other people. It looks like he does not have anything to say.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"me parecio una buena pelicula, entretenida, me gusto toda la trama aunque me hubiese gustado ver mas accion creo que quedo bien , espero la continuacion que debe ser con mas exploxiones y el corte de clasificacion R"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was painful to watch. You want it to be good, but it just isn't. You hope it gets better, but it won't. It's sad."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No originality, clich√©d plot, and unimaginative directing."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Too many slow motion scenes... It also feels like a low quality patchwork of other sci-fi franchises, the acting feels forced and overall the movie is very hard to watch until the end"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Too many critics don't know what a good sci-fi is! It doesn't need to be perfect, but exciting new/fresh- some good action, interesting characters and adventure. Most of all entertaining! 5 stars if you're a chill sci-fi fan. If you're very specific 3.5-4."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Looked great, action was pretty cool. Seen the story before but how many original movies do you see now anyway. Would have liked some more fun moments but generally enjoyed it. Can't understand the massively negative reviews from the critics"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,a sci fi epic there isn't anything not to like about it
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme incr√≠vel, a hist√≥ria, os personagens, a fotografia, tudo te envolve pra ver at√© o fim, e quando chega o fim vc j√° fica querendo o pr√≥ximo, fazia mto tempo que n√£o via uma produ√ß√£o t√£o boa assim."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,jeeesus christ that was rotten
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I waited for this movie for a while to be disappointed. Let's say I had high hopes for it I guess, but it's no less than any movie really. I give it 2 stars cause they say ""voetsek"" WE LOVE voetsek,and that uniform, gosh it's fire, but except those it would be 1 star really."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Amazing sets and special effects but the story is muh and the characters are not great.  One accent in particular is sore on the ears when it is a family one, he should have stuck to Geordie!
I think the problem is that because it is spread across 2 films the pace was slower than expected.... lets wait and see what the second installment brings."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I feel like hollywood just reached the lvl of bollywood. These movies are terrible. Zero original story the script is extremly dull. I dont really know how anyone could like this. 
I know whats gonna happen in ALL the scenes.
All of the ideas been in a movie before. 
Dont waste ur time to watch."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Where to start. Rebel moon has to be the biggest disappointment of the year, so much hype and anticipation for a movie just for it turn out to be as interesting as watching paint dry(with a touch of slow mo). I thought Zack would do better being free from WB, but he just got worse and there's no one to blame this time."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The film is filled moved along by character decisions that make no sense relative to what has actually gone on in the story.
Exposition dumps occur regularly because the writing is to poor to show you what is happening so it has to tell you. Yet even those explanations don't match up with the in universe reasoning.

This is terrible and anyone involved in the creative process of it should feel great shame."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Something new and fresh with a lot of creativity. Something Disney will never make. Deserves more praise than it's getting.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this.  It's kind of what I wish the new Star Wars movies were like.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is better than what people are saying. I'm looking forward to part two.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Solo falla en 3 o cuatro puntos del guion totalmente mejorable en la 2
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This part is setting everything up, I honestly never read the books or source material but I thoroughly enjoyed it, there's some lagging scenes but I believe that it's needed to develop the entire series.  I think honestly you have to give it a go and see for yourself and see what you think.  It's not as action packed as some would hope but again it's the first part! Again I enjoyed it, hope you'll give it a go and make your own judgement"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good enough. Entertaining. Nothing life changing.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"A more than notable film, although it draws from several sources (300, Star Wars, the magnificent seven (no one seems to remember that these last two have influences or come directly from Seven Samurai))
It is increasingly clear to me that specialized critics live in a distorted reality. We are not going to ask for a handful of Oscars for the film, but please respect a film that is fun and really well made.
I highly recommend watching it, you will not be disappointed, waiting for the second part."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fotografia e efeitos especiais muitos bons  Filme muito criativo, personagens interessantes por√©m teria sido melhor uma s√©rie. Senti o desenvolvimento da hist√≥ria r√°pido demais e com cenas de luta que poderiam tranquilamente serem cenas de final de filme. Senti falta de mais conex√£o entre as cenas. Mas no geral me agradou muito. Quero assistir a parte 2. Tomara que fuja do √≥bvio."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome visuals, superb cast and incredible entertaining!"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Imagine firefly in a early medival setting minus the wit. Is it perfect? Hell No! But it shure entertained me for all its 2 hour runtime. And is that Not what we came Here for?
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Mediocre at best. So many scenes were predictable...the villain kills people with a cane? A CANE? Ok, there were a couple of good action scenes, and the effects for the most part were decent...but I felt there was no soul in the movie. Characters were flat, some slow scenes almost put me to sleep. I really was hoping for something better and more exciting."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its by far the best sci-fi/fantasy movie I have seen this year (after Dungeons and Dragons). Its not to say that its a masterpiece, but its not a Disney star wars or a marvel movie and its good enough to be excited about the next installments. I will definitively rewatch this movie again."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Magnificent 7 meets Starwars vibe.  I don't know why people didn't like this movie.  It is super entertaining. You can tell that it has a bug budget as soon as Anthony Hopkins does the voice over intro.  If you don't like Sci fi action,  big explosions, or uncomfortable situations, not for you.  Otherwise, a lot of fun."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent environments, excellent effects, interesting story, in short a good movie, what ""the creator"" should have been."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If only they'd spent 10% less on the effects and put the money into a decent script, this would have been a lot less awful."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Once again.  A STRONG FEMALE ROLE.  She can beat every strong man in the universe.  It seems that this movie was made up from bits and pieces from other movies.  Nothing unique.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I Feel it could Be Far Better  But it Has Earn The Respect  & i want More .

1. CIG Needs a lot of work But Most of it was Solid 

2. Story Telling was Solid  it did not Push the Max of Epic Story Telling But it Did Put it way above average. 

3. Ship  was Very Weak  ship Design. Felt off like less Creative and More Rushed .

4. Character Arc's Felt Good Solid But not To  strong But Good enough . Could Be Better some Story Line was odd but Like the Leader Dying in the way He died was Crazy due to That 1 Guy Farmer saying something made the main Leader murder
it Felt Forced . not organic"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie! Idk why people say it sucked, it was great!"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was entertaining.  The best way I can describe it would be to say that it plays more like a Space DnD with a DM who is pulling their hair out because all of the players rolled the most ABSURD characters possible and is now desperately trying to keep the shell of his original story idea SOMEWHAT intact.  That being said, there were a lot of interesting worldbuilding tidbits that I'm curious to, (hopefully), see expanded upon in part two."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,2 hours & 15mins of fluff. Focused on spectacle over substance. Boring characters with an even duller plot.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed the movie; the visuals were fantastic. However, there's this sense that something is missing. It's clear that the movie is just one piece of a larger story. Maybe that's the reason‚Äîit feels like there are unanswered questions or parts of the plot that are waiting to be explored in the broader narrative. Despite this, the overall experience was great, especially with the stunning visuals. Looking forward to seeing how the story unfolds in the next installment."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,TIO ZACK N√ÉO DESCEPCIONA NUNCA.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Horrible in every way...
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic! It's what the Star Wars reboot should have been!
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Its a begining of a brand new story, not a reboot, sequal or adaptation. Full of the characteristics of Zack and yet a logically good way to introducing a strong female protagonist."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Listen, this movie is actually great and hilarious. Action and visuals are very good and the northern Irish accent are a fun addition in space (I'm Irish). I think this movie will be better in context of the whole saga."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Boring story and it feels like nothing gets really explained. Just jumping from one scene to the other....
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I went in hoping it would be good..unfortunately I was disappointed, poorly written,bland characters and way too much slo mo"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"love science fiction ,nice story good plot , pretty girl what more you want?"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Was expecting it to be a little darker, scarier and more action packed. Too simplistic. The main lady's character has no character development. She's just inherently cool, no struggle, no learning curve, we just need to assume she's a great fighter even though whatever fighting she indulged in wasn't anything special and most of it is just talked about. Why should we assume? Show us something that proves she's a great fighter, not just running and screaming in slow mo all the time. Yes!! Too much slow mo!!! This movie is for 12 year olds who have no experience in watching movies. Boring!!! Give us something dark, realistic, raw and intense. This is just run of the mill, copy paste rerun mish mash with average CGI. The hype behind this movie for so many years!!! Just turned out to be a fart. I'm not really looking forward to the next one."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,it is awesome just i cried watching it genious work by zack evry one should watch it love from india #rebelmoon
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was visually well made, but the story and the choice of actors were completely off.

It may well be that Charlie Hunnam is from Newcastle .. While his attempt at a Scottish accent (or whatever it was supposed to be) was embarrassingly to watch.

In general, the characters' stories lacked depth and it all seemed super shallow.

I could go on and on, but that would take forever to finish üòµ‚Äçüí´

So here's a quick summary:
10% acting
10% Story
20% slide attacks
60% slow motion effect

Do I think part 2 will be better? NO!"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's absolute junk. Despite going on forever it's boring and tedious. I don't think the director has managed to make a good movie for years and this certainly isn't one either.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"A must see, better than star wars, and provides room for growth in a new sci series"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was an incredible beginning to this new franchise.  The visual effects, fight choreography, the world-building, the story, and each of the characters are top notch.  I look forward to seeing this all expanded upon in the upcoming director's cut and in part 2.  I have now seen this four times, and it gets better with every watch.  Highly recommended."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This felt like all the characters did was stand on a box and give speeches to an audience. Visually stunning, but a dud, sad but true."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not very good, so much of the story was overly dramatic.  Every single line of dialog seemed forced. Characters were hastily introduced. This is what I imagine the Hallmark channel would do with a sci-fi movie, but with a decent visual effects budget."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Too many voices that are willing to die on the Star Wars hill... 

A great film for those who don't want to start at the beginning of SW and only to see the SW saga just go downhill from the first trilogy... very watchable and enjoyable"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"boring, hard to watch with 10X speed
Story 1/10
VFX 3/10
Acting 1/10
Boring 10/10"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Interesting Universe and visually stunning, but falls apart quickly when it follows the same format of every movie of this generation.  The story lacks any substance"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It could've been awesome but unfortunately it's just boring, endless slow mo in the fight scenes, barely any character back story so you don't care what happens to them because your not really invested in it. If they'd made a better movie you might be able to look past them basically ripping off 5 other better films. Maybe he'll surprise us all with part 2, but I won't hold my breath."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visuals, action sequences, and overuse of slowmo seem to be the focus vs developing characters I would care the slightest bit about. Came very close to just shutting it off and have zero interest in part two."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Es de las mejores que he visto
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Zack is the Goat, this movie has Oscar gold written all over!!"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you take it for what it is...CGI/Sci-Fi/action and are in it for the visuals, it is definitely entertaining and I'll watch the next one. But I'm a nerd for the alien stuff, the tick thing talking through the guy was really cool üòÜ"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Lucas could sue for copyryght claims. But all in all it was entertaining. What would be way better is if they took Horus Heresy from Warhammer 40k and made it into live action.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Le doy una estrella por el apartado visual. El gui√≥n no tiene ning√∫n sentido, ya que consigue que el 95% de los personajes te den igual y no te sepas ni los nombres. Pel√≠cula de presentaci√≥n de personajes en la que el crecimiento o avance de los mismos es nulo. 
Adem√°s, se nos plantea una sociedad hiper avanzada tecnol√≥gicamente que se preocupa sobremanera por el trigo de un pueblo de 50 personas. Rid√≠culo."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Anyone who likes Star Wars will love this film. The first part is still lacking in depth, it essentially serves to introduce the characters. I think it will be great."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,A classic tale retold for modern audiences. It was a beautiful spectacle. I would have loved to see this in theaters. 5 Star Movie
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Homages lots of previous things, visually pretty amazing

The story mythology and the world building is excellent, excited to see part 2!"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very basic plot and doesnt bring anything new to the genre. Very forgetable movie.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's so bad in so many different levels that I can't believe it actually got produced.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"love it, cant wait for part 2"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sick of you horrible critics putting negative scores on masterpieces like this.  


You have absolutely no leg to stand on as you shout your filth against art and creativity that has been portrayed in part one of this film.

You say things like uninspiring, or artistically negligent.  I look forward to assessing your other reviews and wonder what it takes to be earn a decent score in the eyes of a rotton tomato these days.  

As it stands the tomato standards are out of balance and out of touch.  These reviews are garbage and should be thrown out as such.

Garrett Coster"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Incredible movie, obviously inspired by many films. Visuals are top tier, good dialogue and the universe makes you want part 2 immediately."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Despite its downsides, I thought it was an entertaining movie, what happened Zack? so much potential and beautiful cinematography, but the writing on this is a disaster, zero character development, sorry big friend Zack, but this was a 6/10 being generous."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"""This movie felt a lot like Star Wars.  But without any of the likable and memorable characters. A definite swing and a miss."""
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bad acting (script's fault), bad script, awful slow-mo action scenes, at some point Sofia makes nonsensical moves too obvious because of that slo-mo, not an original idea in sight, everything cool is a ripoff of something else and not a decent character development in there...  Glad it wasn't part of Star Wars as it would've been the death of the franchise. Bad storytelling with great (but far from flawless) visuals doesn't make a good movie, although I'm sure the easily entertained will like it."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I really tried to watch this film. But oof, the dialogue was bad, not feeling the visual effects, no character development. This is ZS's worst film ever. I enjoyed Sucker Punch more than this film."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Basic plot, basic story, basic characters. Nothing super interesting about this movie but it passed the time. The amount of slow-motion was cringe too."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,High school writing quality. They threw in characters that had no back story so you didn't give a hoot about them. Don't see this.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Esperemos que la segunda parte sea igual de buena
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was great entertainment, visually stunning and one of the better movies I have watched this year. No, it wasn't original, nothing deep and meaningful but I simply don't care, still enjoyed it for what it was."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely fantastic movie. It was exciting the whole way through. Much much better than most movies that have came out recently.i am a huge Star Wars fan and I loved this, I do not understand the negative ""critic"" reviews, makes you wonder if there's something influencing those reviews‚Ä¶

Pacing was excellent, fight scenes were absolutely amazing. Plot was okay but overall really enjoyed this"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Una perdida de tiempo, y esperar su corte final. Mejor que no saque nada si no sabe hacer una buenas pel√≠cula con solo una VERSI√ìN."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a good movie.. dont listen to critics.

The only issue I have with it.. it needs to be longer, It felt alittle rushed.. 

Make Part 2 longer!"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,With all the bad reviews and trash comments I was honestly expecting to be dissapointed. But I finished watchign this movie very excited! I can¬¥t wait for part 2. LOVED REBEL MOON!!!
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it!! Hope it becomes a whole universe
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome storyline and stunning visual effects. the movie has every engriendient to make me want to watch from start to finish, its an awesome action sci-fi screen and I am looking forward to seeying part II."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is a visual spectacle.  It's not a home run but it is a triple.  The story is a similar tale to the Magnificent Seven.  I fell asleep during another recent sci-fi release which I thought was pretty good but I was wide awake for the full length of Rebel Moon.  Like a new restaurant, it only matters if you want to go back, I definitely can't wait for part two.  It did seem a little like the story only set up the individual set pieces but the set pieces were pretty cool.  Anyhow, hopefully part two fleshes out the characters and continues to build the universe of Rebel Moon."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think critics are so out of touch these days. This movie was great. Great visuals, great sound, great casting, and great story. The only issue I had was I could tell some of the editing cut out pieces that would have added to the story. But that's the way it goes these days and I am sure the director's cut will fix it. Even without the director's cut though, it was a very entertaining movie and I can't wait for the second one."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful visuals and score. The characters and story have heart and depth (which I'm hoping will be fleshed out more in the director's cut and part 2). The action is impressive, and the mythology is rich. Definitely left me wanting more!"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie was brilliant. Excellent special effects, Fantastic cast, A must see."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is Amazing. I simply don't know why citics say bad things about the movie.. Just watch this.. it a whole different vibe. Thanks zack for making an amazing master piece like thisüî•üî•üî•
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Una pel√≠cula interesante con muy buen contenido entretenida en pocas palabras genial
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Too much slow motion and the story is predictable but I really enjoyed myself and it is way better then what ever Disney produced in the last 2 years‚Ä¶ the movie did its job. I was entertained ü§©
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I am pretty open minded and went in neutral despite the bad reviews and finding most of snyders stuff to be OK for what they are. Straight up though, this was just a bad movie in every aspect imaginable.

The special effects, the fighting scenes, the cuts, the camera work (there is a depth of field gimmick used so poorly in the movie to try and hide how bad the cgi environs are) , the writing, the terrible acting, the story...

It's all made for TV Sci fi Chanel movie level garbage. I am genuinely shocked at just how bad this was. 

Genuinely one of the worst movies of seen in some time."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Poorly executed ""Battle Beyond the Stars"" remake destined to be a trash cinema classic"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely fantastic. It's difficult to create something new ; new world, characters, planets, from scratch. They have to already established in the story you create and we pick it up as we go. This was done well, and the characters still have stories to tell. The second movie should fill in the gaps, as many sequels do, but everything is engaging thus far."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"¬øQu√© hay despu√©s de vencer a la muerte cuando ya no esperas nada de la vida?Para El ni√±o de fuego hay mucha, mucha m√∫sica. Escuchar y componer rap es su refugio pero tambi√©n todo lo que cualquier chico de su edad har√≠a, salir con amigos, sacar el carnet de conducir o simplemente celebrar su cumplea√±os"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Main char is boring and bland. Twist is so predictable. I they won the fight is just stupid.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie has good action enjoying the space scenes
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,excelente visualmente :)
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was rooting for this movie but it turns out that it's just a terrible recycled version of Dune with elements from Star Wars, Star Trek Beyond and Avatar. There are scores of original writers and stories out there waiting for a screenplay. I had to force myself to finish while occupying my boredom on the phone."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A very poor remake of Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven/Bugs Life that steals from every major franchise. It has scenes straight out of Star Wars, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Dune, Firefly, Indian Jone, Lord of the Rings, Warhammer 40K, etc. It is only 2 hours long because half the film is in slow motion including ploughing a filed FFS!"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,WTH?! I only made it through the first 45 minutes before enough was enough.. I REALLY wanted to love this but it's just bad. The recruiting  of the fighters/characters to oppose the mother world was absolutely cringe worthy! This trope is better executed in bad Donghua and Anime. This is a disappointment and a shame.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,De verdad me pareci√≥ estar viendo una mala copia de pel√≠culas anteriores. Todo mal ejecutado y escenas sacadas de la nada sin contexto. Es incre√≠ble tener que esperar siempre una versi√≥n extendida de la misma pel√≠cula para poder entenderla. No la volver√≠a a ver.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I see this as early days, they are world building and introducing characters to see the scene, so it's a bit slow in places and not mind blowing yet. But I can see definite potential here!
The scenery is beautiful and although it's heavily CGI enhanced it doesn't distract which is great. 
The fight scenes are fantastic as I knew they would be as Sofia Boutella excels at physical combat in most of her films. Though as others have said, there is a lot of slow motion in the fight scenes, but it's probably just to give you time to process everything that is happening as it's often quite a lot. 
Great cast, not sure about Staz Nair, maybe I'll warm to him, but everyone else was superb and delivered good or very good performances. 
Overall very entertaining though, and I look forward to more."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"As I thought, it wasn't as terrible as the critic reviews suggested. It was entertaining to me! I thought it did some things really well. The story concept has me perfected although it's a bit jumbled. My biggest critique is the pacing and the really bad CGI of the ships. They looked really out of place lol"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great storyline, amazing visuals, unexpected twists and turns, may have been better served as a series though to flush out the story more, explore the lore and explore each character"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome movie Zack's done it again
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,not bad not great. too much action too little plot but not hard to watch
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Deben de verla me parece incre√≠ble la trama de la pel√≠cula.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie starts in a farming community. This part showed promise, as the characters were endearing, and the danger they were in was compelling. Once the movie moved on from that community, the character development was almost non-existent. I had difficulty caring what happened to any of them. Some of the special effects were good, but the frequent fight scenes were jammed with way too many slow motion periods. I became so bored I wanted to turn the movie off. Stupidly, I stuck with it. I wish I hadn't."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don't let the ignorant online hate keep you from watching one of the best movies of 2023. I swear if the same movie came out but the directors name was Scorsese, Coppola, or hell even Nathan Fielder, the critics would be praising this movie and it would have a 95% on here."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"i really love this movie, not what i was expected, but a fresh movie in this lack of content in the recent years that can entretain you with something that can be watchable. Sofia Boutella looks awesome, i really hope the next movies give more to the development of characters."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I actually quite enjoyed the movie. I thought the special effects were pretty good!
The only thing letting it down was Kai's Northern Irish accent. It was truly truly awful and did ruin the movie a bit for me."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Well, when watching it's quite easy to see right off the bat why so many people are being critical of this film. It's definitely not without its flaws, and there are several. However from what I've heard, there's to be an ‚ÄòR rated' Director's Cut being released next spring, purportedly featuring an additional hour or so of extra content that's meant to fill in the majority of gaps in the character development and storyline issues that people keep complaining about.
 
I agree with many on this point, that although it's technically a movie with 2+ hour runtime, it does feel seemingly rushed through, but on the upside, I thought the pacing moved along pretty swiftly throughout, aka meaning, I didn't find myself at all getting bored. Those 2+ hours blew by, and admittedly by the time the credits were rolling, I was left feeling the desire to see more. Which isn't so bad since Part II is supposedly being released soon-ish.

So me personally, I'm eager to watch the directors cut despite an estimated runtime of 3.5 hours. I believe the upcoming extended release version will potentially add on another 1/2 star to my initial rating due to it providing a sense of completeness to whatever seemed lacking from the first edit. 

In summary, was this the absolute best sci-fi flick of the year that rivals the likes of the monolithic galaxies portrayed in Star Wars? Oh, HELL to the NO‚Ä¶but was it something that's adequately entertaining, dazzling to eyes and a fairly decent way to spend an evening passing some time? Yes. Yes, I believe it is."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,A nice break from the super hero movies thats been flooding us in the movies and tv
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,ya quiero ver parte dos
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Poderia ter aprofundado mais a hist√≥ria dos personagens? Poderia sim, mas fica complicado contar em detalhes a vida de tantos personagens interessantes. Acho que cada personagem em si renderia excelentes narrativas. Mas ainda assim √© um filma√ßo. Fazia muito tempo que n√£o assistia algo t√£o bom. J√° assisti duas vezes e ainda vou assistir outras vezes."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it!!! From beginning to the end.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"nothing of real interest, CGI was good thats about it , everything was predictable,"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not bad for an intro to the franchise, I guess? Clearly most of the budget went to visuals. Worldbuilding and character development is a little thin. Especially the main character! Still, not bad considering the runtime of only 2+ hours. I hope part 2 is better."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Pero qu√© diablos acabo de ver? El cine no creo que se trate de tener solo una que otra buena toma, unas frases pegadoras y c√°mara lenta, deben contar una buena historia. Esto hace de todo menos contar una buena historia. Para dormir est√° buenisima, eso s√≠"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,As usual critics are out of their minds. Is Rebel Moon Citizen Kane‚Ä¶absolutely not. But that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable!
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! The look of the everything in this movie is amazing. The sound (especially the ship thrusters) was remarkable.
Without getting into details of the story...the Twist got me hard!

Cant wait for the Part 2"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Story was a jumbled mess. You don't build any care for the characters. To mush slow motion that doesn't have the intended effect. Overall a poorly done movie. Only thing that was good was the acting
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie celebrates the worst of ZS
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Probably the worst movie my son and I have seen in the past few years. Honestly it's so awful it's to the point of laughter bad. Worst dialogue, nonstop front loaded exposition, awful acting, fragmented scenes jumbled together. Tropes are lame and recycled, everything ripped off from either Star Wars, dc, or marvel but executed 1/100th as well.  It's so bad that we turned Rebel Moon on (for the third time, can't watch something this awful in one sitting) just to get some laughs in. By then last 10m we were laughing nonstop it was some lame and ridiculous. Everyone who participated in writing the script should be fired."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the movie was excellent. As a sci-fi / horror fan , well done ! Excellent character choices and actors . Visuals and storyline were great . So excited for part 2 !"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,To my sons and I it was Warhammer 40k meets the Magnificent 7.  We enjoyed it and can't wait for the next installment.  We liked the characters and the setting.  It's so much better than most things being put out.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was amazing. Very gripping. Was filmed beautifully. Excited for the next one
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed the movie looking forward to part 2.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed it.  Is it perfect no, but it is highly entertaining.  Can't wait for part 2."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Com uma fotografia estonteante e um universo interessante, Rebel Moon nos apresenta algo diferente no visual, por√©m fraqu√≠ssimo em narrativa. Os pontos altos do longa est√£o na sua dire√ß√£o que prioriza bastante o visual, seja em a√ß√£o ou contempla√ß√£o, embora as cenas em slow motion se tornem exageradas e irritantes ao longo de suas duas horas de filme. O roteiro √© falho em muitos aspectos, ele apresenta conceitos e personagens e n√£o os desenvolve em momento algum, deixando a trama apressada e sem profundidade. O filme em s√≠ pode trazer alguma divers√£o, mas se contenta com a mediocridade."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Clearly based on a mix of stories and details from other movies, still a good story and a good film"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Pretty good movie. Especially if you like a decent sci fi flick. Glad I watched it. I will watch again and hope for a sequel
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was a bugs life with people. So much potential with interesting characters that were not utilized in this part (hope they go into those stories in pt 2). Visuals are nice, have some eye candy, and kickass female fighters, but not good at all. It was so bad it turned my stomach."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Whoa! Make sure you watch this one on trash pickup day because this movie hot garbage! Since it is visually stunning, I moved it from 1-star to 2-stars. But it honestly has nothing else going for it other than beautiful set pieces. After spending 2+ hours with these characters, I can honestly say you will know them as well at the beginning of the movie as you do at the end. The character development is almost non-existent, and then we are asked to care when certain characters are killed -- but there is 0 emotional connection and the story is so wide-ranging you would need to make it a series to do it justice. 

Going from place to place to collect a rag-tag group of fighters for an upcoming battle, our heroine encounters one person after another who wants no part of it -- only to have their mind changed by a three-sentence speech from our protagonist. Umm...I don't think so. This on top of being introduced to a couple of characters early on that are made to feel like they will be integral to the plotline, only to have them completely disappear after the first 10 minutes."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,good movie...  I would definitely watch a sequel.  It has a good overall story and I look forward to seeing the story continue.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wasn't bad, but wasn't good either. The story has lots of holes in it, character development is janky, but it passed the time."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Boring.  Lame Star Wars ripoff.  I fell asleep multiple times.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing. I just think these critics have trouble following a complex sci-fi story
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"For me its decent not Zack's best nor his worst I will say go ahead and release the Director's cut, its not a terrible movie imo but it does feel like something missing."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This is a good movie.  Many have stated it is derivative of Star Wars and The Magnificent Seven.  So what? The Magnificent Seven was remake of the Seven Samurai.  I like the visuals and the action scenes.

Sure,  anyone can guess the plot line.  Sit back with a beer or glass of wine and enjoy the ride.  Good mind candy."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"From the first scene on, the visuals, characterisation and acting combine into something that feels, looks and sounds like a bad case of CGI fanfic. And so it turns to be. On the edge of being unwatchable, you just feel strung along in a story that seems to continuously grouse: this is what Star Wars should be. And that is before someone thought it was a good idea to resurrect General Bison."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Good fun movie and can't wait for part 2.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Tanto imbarazzante quanto monotono
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I loved the cinematic visual effects, but as a first part to a 2 part story I feel that there was missing a deeper story of every characters."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not sure why anyone's calling this ""visually dazzling."" The first 30 minutes on the farm planet (Middle Earth Tattooine) have a few fun looking aliens and some very Lord of the Rings inspired set dressing. Even though everyone seems to have dressed at the local Gap Outlet.

After the first 30 minutes, everything is underlit, out of focus, with enough lens flare to choke JJ Abrams. Every space location is a murky, featureless unpopulated void. Every ship is an underdetailed conglomeration of boxy shapes. 

This is dull and derivative from start to finish, its limited imagination seemingly butting against a limited budget. Half of the effects look good, half look like they were rendered in 2003. 

If you really want an incomprehensible, overstuffed sci-fi epic with terrible dialog but pretty visuals, just watch Jupiter Ascending. It's better. Which is saying something."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing! Forget the critic fanboys! Get your popcorn out this is a good one!
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This film was boring, I was sick of the slow motion button, and for the love of god can a director stop with this ""I have a directors cut but it's the studios fault"" excuse it's becoming clear Zack is great at visuals but storytelling not so much especially when it comes to a complex plot & i'm sorry the lead while she's an ok actress she is not a lead. I didn't care about a single character not one"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Buen√≠sima.!!!
Esta hecha para gente con mente abierta dispuesta a imaginarse sobre lo que suceder√° en un futuro, para mi que Zack sacara cortos o ira explicando lo que les sucedi√≥ a todos los Rebeldes que form√≥ Arthelais."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,RB is amazing!!! Can't wait for the next part!üî•üî•
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Couldn't get me to care about any of the main characters. The dialogue was groan-inducing, everything felt like moving from one set piece to another, characters get introduced only to disappear for the rest of the movie. too many characters but not enough character development (when one of the blood axes? died, I got from the music that it was supposed to be dramatic and emotional, but I had made ni connection to the character to care). The action sequences and fight choreography were amateurish and frankly a little cartoonish. and for all the somewhat fancy graphics, the world felt small and one-dimensional.

As a huge sci-fi geek, I really wanted this show to be good. Alas, it was not to be,"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic amazing & interesting
Great storyline and Great cast
Can't wait for part 2"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Critics are either blind or paid off... I can not wait for the next one!
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was awesome , the visuals , the costumes , the story , the characters, it was all well done , it seemed to me that it was (in my opinion what Star Wars should have been ). With little to no comic relief and a ton of action."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Rebel Moon is a visually stunning film. Sofia Boutella delivers a great performance as the lead character. The villains were great at making me truly dislike them through out the film. A much better film to experience on Re-watch
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I'm not sure what movie the so called critics watched it's definitely better than 23%
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Amazing visuals and lots of world building. Intriguing story and the cast did a great job! With all that said, the third act seemed a bit rushed and the pacing was fast throughout the movie starting at about 30 mins in. I'd recommend the movie, but I'm more excited for the director's cut to explore this world further, and see unhinged Zack. I'd give this a B- or a C/B."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Whooo all the hate for nothing yes there is slow motion that it is too much some times and yelling lirics in slowmo but what bother me the most was the blur he used way to much and makes the film look bad other than that is a must see cant believe this was 2 hrs it was like wahtching 45 mins
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm not sure why critics are not liking this. Perhaps Hollywood is telling them not to? I found this very well done. The story was interesting, the plot was excellent. The acting was good and the special effects were movie theater quality. The world building was well thought out as well. I know this was originally pitched as a Star Wars movie, but I think it's much better than anything lately that Disney has put out. I can't wait for part 2 to come out!"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Loved the visuals and the possibility of more world building and character development. I was only let down by less screen time of the other characters. Like those are missed opportunities. I just don't get why they have to do a director's cut when they can just release the 3hr version. Also, I was hoping to see a Batman warehouse type of action but nope. Maybe on the second part?"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Some great visuals, but wooden acting and a mess of a story can't save this mashup of everything scifi in the microwave."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Uma colcha de retalhos de clich√™s, personagens sem densidade, enxertados, sem carisma, hist√≥ria sem ritimo consistente, est√©tica que descola os personagens do cen√°rio, figurinos que copiam de Star Wars a gladiador. Tinha c√≥pia da cena do Anakin pilotando pod no c√¢nion ( o ind√≠gena gen√©rico com o arremedo de hipogrifo do Harry Potter), c√≥pia de free Willy quando o bicho passa e a protagonista que usa capa Jedi levanta a m√£o,falsa representatividade com negros sem falas relevantes e personagens dispens√°veis, feitos para morrer e isso nem gera empatia no p√∫blico. Personagens que s√£o fracas representa√ß√µes de outras etinias ( √≠ndio gen√©rico e nedro vestido de gladiador) com pouca roupa como se seus corpos fosse objetos. Ind√≠gena e preto n√£o tem sensa√ß√µes t√©rmicas? N√£o precisa de figurino elaborado e consistente? S√≥ os brancos ? Est√©tica muito √© milar a outros filmes do diretor que parece ter um fasc√≠nio pela est√©tica nazifascista."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The art in this movie was amazing mate. The guns where amazing. The sound effects where on point. The slow mo of ray fisher smashing that pole in the ship .. The aliens , that was epic,  cannot wait for part 2."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a great movie with a lot of fun ideas people need to understand this is part one
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a great movie in point too don't know why rotten tomatoes has rated it so low one of the best movies I've seen for years can't wait for part 2
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Such a lazy movie and even worse acting.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"this was as much fun as star wars rise of skywalker and that s not good. the moment the movie completely lost me was the gryphon scene. i thought who is this for? i am not a child. i don t think this is cool or fantastic. it was so cliched and silly. but then before this scene there were two sexual assaults. so why should this be for children? if i want to watch a mysterious boy tame a gryphon i ll watch harry potter. imagine grand moff tarkin had tried to sexually assauly leia. gritty, right? 
we start with bar hero. next scene gryphon boy, asian jedi lady, dirty general... the scenes just happen and that s how they pick up the members of their superteam. why anyone would join her? no idea. it just happens. 
the characters all have funky accents or dialects, never wash up or change their clothes. no matter where they are. gryphon boy should put on a jacket. i know his abs are amazing, but doesn t he ever get chilly? 
there isn t really more to say about the characters in this movie. their characterization is their outfits and the weird way each individual speaks. 
i am sorry. i think this was trash and not the good kind of trash. the 13th warrior with antonio banderas is good trash. also seven samurai inspired. watch that and give it 5 stars if you must, but not this.
why just one star? because it is bad and very long and we will have to endure an even longer version... this movie wastes too much time..."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pleasantly surprised at the story, effects, synchronization, and depth of this story. 

Critics will pan this film, but the people will love it!"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,If you like sci-fi this is good. It has homages paid to the genre through out it. I have read critic reviews and I am convinced I would not like many of the critics IRL.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Trope city. If they had spent a bit more on the script and less on the flash, then this Magnificent Seven wanna be just might have been something.  If I had spent money on the big screen to see it I would have been upset...streaming it at least takes the edge off. Visuals are good, acting is...just two steps above reading the script verbatim. If it's late and you can't sleep then give it a whirl, otherwise you're not missing out by missing this."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fantastic film, great fun & incredible cinematography, can't wait for part 2!"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just saw this move and had some doubts. The reviews are not great. But I was pleasantly surprised. If you don't compare it to anything and just take it at face value it's not a bad movie. In today's world you can watch a different movie at the push of a button, so for a movie to hold my attention for 2 hours that, to me, is a good move."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The professional critics giving this movie a 25% are the worst of Internet trolls. This is a very entertaining epic scale sci-fi movie. Sure there could be a little more character development, or a little less homage to movies like The seven samurai, but at the end of the day all these stories have been told. You won't regret watching this unless you're a real weenie."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It has the best of the Director visually; the story is serious, and creates enough drama and the story line as the first act of several future chapters."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A big budget knockoff of a low budget knockoff.  Basically, this is a knockoff of ""Battle Beyond the Stars"", the 1980 Roger Corman film which was, in itself, a knockoff of both ""Star Wars"" and ""The Magnificent Seven"", set in space. There was nothing new here that hadn't been already done over 40 years ago.  Very disappointed in Zack as this was a very lazy attempt to spit shine an old doorknob.  I pray that part 2 as well as the directors cuts add some extra polish to this film, otherwise it was just an over-hyped and very expensive exercise in lazy story-telling."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely was a much needed Sci-fi action, adventure film. Worth the wait. The story, film graphics, actors/actresses were awesome. What we need now is either Part 2 and/or the uncut versions!"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I dont know what the critics are smoking. I really enjoyed this and plan to watch again.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is an example of forced filmmaking. The story is not compelling, nor are the characters believable. The acting consists primarily of reading monologues or staring angrily at the camera. There is nothing memorable about the music, scenery or the vehicle design. ""Move along. This is not the film you are looking for. """
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Some scenes are just a joke. Lot of marketing, lack of raw material. Will not be watching part 2"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Masterpiece of modern SF.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,can't wait for the next one. I think it was very good.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it really good modern take on 7 samurai's. It's everything that the Star Wars sequels could have been but weren't. I would definitely recommend. My wife even liked it lol
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"OK. Sp you can see almost from the beginning it was meant to be a star wars movie. But it's sufficiently reworked to be something different. Borrows not just from SW but Warhammer Seven Samurai Dune & others.
Took its time to spell out the story and while characters are solid some could have done with a bit more polishing. It's interesting enough to keep you watching to the end & I have a feeling pt2 will even better. 
It's a good film. Way better than anything contained the SW sequels. It concentrates on telling the story which is what is most important. I don't what film the critics watched but it wasn't this one. This is a good film."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This is something else. It is good, maybe nit great but us very entertaining. Visuals in general are great, some CGI does look strange at times when ir comes to characters/creatures. This is the first of three so  it clearly st up characters and story so it's not expected to be action packed though it delivers accordingly. Yeah is not nothing new in terms of Ci-Fi fantasy, I didn't like the element of having a fantasy magical creature but the rest of the concept of a universe more looking like ours gives it a different touch some people might expect more futuristic aspect but that would be a Star Wars/Star Trek thing, it's obvious they wanted ro be far away from that and that is fine."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,I don't understand critics much these days. I enjoyed this movie and felt predictable but I want to see story to the end. Enjoyable action and for me characters were developed enough that I rooted for good guys and hated bad guys
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,This is a great movie.  Best of 2023.  Stunning visuals.  I cannot wait to see part 2.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"A visual treat which the potential for awesome world building. Loved it, bring on the extended edition and part 2."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed it, even if it takes from scifi everywhere. Its worth a watch."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A really bad remake of Seven Samurai. It's been remade before, but much better. The Magnificent Seven, A Bugs Life, even the low budget Battle Beyond The Stars was better than this. A slow mo action mess of a movie that's full of boring exposition."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The film has zero ideas of its own. The story is based on Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece ""The Seven Samurai"" or later the western remake ""The Magnificent Seven"". Then add borrowings from ""Star Wars"", a pinch of ""Dune"", a little ""Avatar"" and stir vigorously. An almost painfully frequent use of slow-motion effects, as if the director wanted to say ""we couldn't think of anything, that's why we're making the film so artificially long."" Illogical situations, such as a simple farmer who has never left his home planet before, knows how to deactivate the mother world's execution device without ever seeing it. And the end of the first part is so copied from ""Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith"" that it's embarrassing. If you want to have a nice evening with an exciting film, you should rather go back to one of the originals that ""Rebel Moon"" was ""inspired"" by."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"He had dialogues with ZERO subtext, all exposition, a useless amount of slowmotion that borders the ridiculous, and characters with ZERO depth, expecially the protagonist. The only good thing is the CGI"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining tribute Kurosawa 7 Samur√°is versi√≥n. Great visuals.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another overhyped copy and paste movie, borrow everything from everywhere and hope that something will stick, Steal the plot from seven samurai, mix in a healthy dose of star wars."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Rebel Moon is definitely a good movie. Far from perfect, but nowadays we should get our wins whenever we can.

The story is simple, perhaps a little too simple. And it doesn't dodges the typical cliches seen in this genre of movies. But we can see the potential of this world that Zack Synder has created.

Overall character performances were good and some even very good, unfortunately the performance of the main character Kora (Sophia Boutella) is not amongst them. I had hoped she had grown more as an actress, but it seems clear she will not be growing beyond what she has already shown in the past.
And it's a shame really seeing her character played perhaps by another actress like let's say Emily Blunt, would've really shined and could've perhaps been the creation of quite an important character within the sci-fi genre.
I understand why Sophia Boutella was chosen for this role, her dancing skills really come through in the action scenes. But it's her ability to show deeper levels of emotion that are lacking and for her character that's also a vital part.

Rebel Moon hasn't done anything groundbreaking or revolutionary, but it's still a solid movie. Same as the story might seem too simplistic to some, to others it seems to go over their heads. Some negative critics about it are not only unwarranted but a little petty. As if they were expecting this movie to be what Star Wars or Alien were in their beginning.
When even Star Wars and Alien can't reproduce their winning formula.

Don't go into this movie with too much expectations and will surprise you in a good way. Go into thinking it will be groundbreaking within the genre and you'll obviously be disappointed.
Rebel Moon has potential and it's a good addition to the genre, but it doesn't do anything that can't be expected from a good sci-fi movie. And that's already quite an achievement considering how little in terms of good sci-fi movies we really get.

At least Rebel Moon doesn't promise to shoot for the Moon only to fall in a few meters."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Yes it is very cheesy in places but, I really enjoyed it.  I felt the first half was probably a bit slower than the rest but the ending had a far different pace.  The action sequences were not bad, that acting was good, but man the script is  not so great.  I get the feeling that Part 2 might even things out more.  Just remember the original Star Wars had some terrible reviews and now is regarded as a true classic..."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,The backstory is pretty long but all the fighting scene all amazing...
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"There is a reason they say show, not tell. This was all tales of the achievements of characters that we barely get to see come together. Just a linear pageant, with the last participant dying to try and fail at making an emotional impact. I couldn't get past the visual effects and stylisation copied from Warhammer 40K universe."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Of course it's derivative, we knew it was a gritty Star Wars meets  Seven Samurai. But the execution is in general good, the action is fun and the visuals dazzling. The plot manages to do decent world building at a brisk pace, keeping exposition to a minimum necessary, letting its derivative natures fill on the gaps for the audience. This first act is about assembling a team of interesting rogues, giving them a thin, mostly implicit backstory, and setting up the second act: their battle against unsurmountable odds to defend the little guy. The acting is ok, it lacks any memorable performances. The climatic fight scene stretches logic a bit, in true Star Wars style only the good guys have good aim and come out on top after being restrained and surrounded by enemy troops. Still it manages to be fun and exciting."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Storyline weak, characters show little to no charisma, part two has a lot of ground to make up!"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"After stealing from other movies (Seven Samurai, Star Wars, Prisoner of Azkaban etc), introducing us more and more boring characters with zero personalities and filling the screen with poor, unfinished video game graphics, Rebel Moon dares to end with ""End of Part One"" text, thinking I'd be interested to watch Part Two."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Visually exciting this movie could be plucked right out of the established Starwars universe. But the story line is hollow and dull leaving you with a sense of sadness and longing for cinema that actually attempted to excite you with new and original ideas. You can easily predict each  plot point as it unfolds like a wet blanket. This is all just copy and paste much the same as the recent Star Wars franchise. As the first part of a trilogy this film attempts to build up anticipation for the subsequent films however I anticipate diminishing viewership for each subsequent part. So much squandered potential.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Not perfect but very beautiful and interesting and I need more exploration
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was great, can't wait for Part 2.
Great visuals and story and ZS style slow-mo action sequences were awesome."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This reminds me of The Magnificant Seven (in space).  Just enough backstorey to move the storey along, great villian (without the Im just misunderstood rubish backstorey), fantastic imagery.  If you are looking for a oscar nomination look elsewhere.  If you want entertainment and escapism, you could do a lot worse."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Der Film ist super!! Frag mich warum bei tollen Filmen immer negative Tomaten von Kritikern vergeben werden, nur weil kein intelektueller M√ºll verbaut wurde, sondern Action vom Feinsten!"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Rebel Moon is a sci-fi film that may appeal to fans of the genre, a masterpiece."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Bro has zero sense for a good script......as always the visuals are on point tho
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie no serious
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,No investment in the characters at all. Slow motion overdone. Editing all over the place. Yep don't care for another cut or the sequel!
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"While it has it's narrative flaws and the characters could use a bit more fleshing out, as a stand alone film it is enjoyable. As the first part in a larger story, I am looking forward to seeing more."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's hard to believe for around ¬£80m this film was made with all the visuals and sets etc.

Good film from start to finish, apparently their is a directors cut expected soon which is even better.

Definitely worth a watch as it sets up it's own universe."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I absolutely loved it. That is a really weird universe.  The almost video game like CGI and simple, and yes, predictable story got me hooked. It's a nice visual show that it's not a High end Disney production. Well, we all know how those manege to astonish us recently. I watched all in Marvel universe masterpieces, and wow, can't really remember the story. General feel of suck. This one is definitively different. May be this is it's appeal. And yes it's heavy on cliche, but it's FUN. Something I did not experience for a long time now. Can't wait for part two. If they make TV show out of this, then great. Initially i thought it's going to be anyway so, bring it, please."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good story 
I bit like starwars a bit like dune 
How Science Fiction should be 
Cant wait for the next movie"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand the negative critic reviews, they need to lighten up and enjoy it for what it is. All in a really solid and enjoyable movie."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I am a massive Star Wars, Dune, Blade Runner and Sci-Fi fan AND I really enjoyed it. The plot is simple but Star Wars was too in 1977! Yes it pulls from all of the above and 7 Samurai and, and‚Ä¶ but it's a great 2 hour romp through space and will keep you and the kids entertained over Christmas. I agree with comments about the characters lacking depth but I am already looking forward to Part 2 in April. Bring it on. Cinema doesn't have to be complex to be enjoyable!"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Its just seven samarai, which has already been adapted to way better futuristic versions."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Dire. Have you ever wanted to see a really boring and bleak remake of Star Wars? This movie is for you.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Odd movie, Star war Nazis vs heroine.  It passed the time but a forgettable movie"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Better than expected. Very interesting universe. Ed Skrein and Charlie Hunnam steal the show. Damn good movie.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,The 7 Samuray in Space... That's all .. Nothing new or original..
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It really is a great movie with a Star Wars feel however the ending has no ending feel and leaves you disappointed there's nothing left to see. I'd recommend not watching until all released. If it's a trilogy I'm guessing the second will be the same.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,We need more adult themed sci-fi films. This was fun for what it was. Some great visuals. Say what you want about Zack but he swings for the fences.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the worst sci-fi I have ever seen.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I did watch the whole thing, not because I enjoyed but because I was curious if each would keep getting worse and if it did, how deep could it sink. Turns out it did and it did indeed end up on the bottom of any reasonable scale. With very few exceptions the characters are one-dimensional caricatures that are impossible to connect to and the whole ""sci-fi"" part looks cheap, with space ships looking as if they have been taken out from a 1998 computer game.

What always amazes me with multi million dollar productions like this - why do they even start with scripts as bad as this? They could have given that script to anyone on the street and they could have pointed out the stupidity. Or is the stupidity intentional?   

This movie is a waste of time. Maybe that is all we need. Waste time."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Rebel Moon was enjoyable and although not perfect. If you like Sci Fi that's abit different you will enjoy this.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Estou triste porque queria muito gostar do filme, assisti de madrugada na hora que lan√ßou e estou decepcionado.  N√£o consegui me importar com os personagens e n√£o foi apresentado o universo muito bem. Triste de mais"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is a great movie to fall asleep. 
I really enjoyed my nap while watching this."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Ok ‚Äòcritics' and haters.. yes, it's highly derivative.. but I've been reading and watching sci-fi and fantasy since I was about 8..(so that's over 60 years :-) and you know what.. if it pays homage to and builds upon past works.. as many other movies before it have.. not even half as well. As long as it's as stunningly beautiful as this, with a terrific cast of actors directed well and obviously invested and giving it their all.. then so what!  If I have one small minor quibble.. it's that the slo-mo in some of the action scenes sometimes seems unnecessary and just dated.. but final verdict ‚Ä¶for any lover of space opera movies...sit back and enjoy‚Ä¶I certainly did!  üëè"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely loved it!  And I'm critical of weak scifi movies.  The story was inspired.  The acting was fair.  At least as good as the best Star wars movies. The villain was good and hateable.  The special effects were top notch.  Great movie in a weak year for movies.   Can't wait for part 2.  Ignore the critics.  It was more fun than Dune
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The worst sci-fi film I've seen in my life. I was confident after seeing Justice League though.
The photography is sometimes barely worthy of a bad PC game.
I don't know what happened but stop immediately, don't release the rest it's useless..."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Immersive and thrilling, Rebel Moon offers an experience that seamlessly blends futuristic visuals with heart-pounding action sequences. The narrative is simple yet captivating, transporting the audience to new and fascinating worlds. The choreographed action scenes are visually spectacular and serve to drive the plot, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. From start to finish, the pacing is expertly handled, ensuring an exciting and thoroughly enjoyable journey."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I'm not saying Rebel Moon is better than Star Wars‚Ä¶ OK.  I am. Why?  The gore of battle!  Star Wars is cute in comparison.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I found the plot derivative, the characters superficial, the dialogue inane, and the stereotypes numbing‚Äîall wastes of the actors' and VFX artists' talents. I was very excited when I first saw ""Rebel Moon"" advertised, but now I just feel sad."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have no idea how people correlate this to star wars. Why? Because it is set in space? What the heck? Zero semblance.
I saw it .ore similar to warhammer 40k. The astra militarum are the bad guys. As far as outfits go primarily.
The film itself is pretty good in story and has a lot of nice battle scene. The slow motions happen a bit too much. I look forward to part 2.
Hopefully, the similar to 'star wars' commenters can get off their delusional band wagons."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Truly atrocious, only worth your time if you are studying film and trying to learn how not to do it."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I honestly think this movie deserved a 3.5 or maybe a 4, but decided to give it a little bit more because of the douchebag critics who are just completely out of touch with an entertaining movie.

Yes, it's not going down as one of the best films of all time... but it's not trying to be.

Looking forward to pt 2 and honestly hoping that they develop a tv series spinoff to really flush out the universe they've created."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,A enjoyable film that took a little from every famous Syfy movie from the past.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's a hard nope from me. Couldn't finish it.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I have seen some good story telling movies. This was not it. Also, not once was I remotely emotionally engaged."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The story line was so boring and predictable. I also didn't like the violence without the blood. Not that it needs to be gory, it was just very Disney. The cinematography was awesome also. The blurred edge effect made me keep questioning if something was wrong with my screen. You could tell it was originally written to be pitched as a Star Wars movie and the. Edited after it was rejected."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Technically excellent, story weak, boring, very disappointing."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Don't listen to the critics. We all have different perspectives and lenses we view the world from. It is a good movie and I cant wait for part 2. I'm sure some will love and some will not. What a boring world it would be if we were all the same. If you like si-fi like Star wars and Dune you will love it. Happy watching!
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Stunning art style and VFX, it had many elements from popular Sci and Fantasy but puts a unique spin in it all. Cant wait for part 2!"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was an entertaining movie, the story line was good, I can't wait for part 2"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie, many action excelent"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Exciting plots, Amazing visuals. Massive world building. Eagerly waiting for part 2"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Rebel Moon is a pretty decent SciFi fantasy. It has a touch of grimdark with some decent action. It is lacking in the action department when compared to Snyders usual films, but the story though clich√© in some ways is satisfying.  Considering the budget the visuals are mostly stellar and the dialog and drama are on par with most scifi epics.. My only major issue is the fact that this film is clearly a part one and feels incomplete. 
Sophia Boutella is a certified action star and does a good job as the lead antagonist.
Do yourself a favor and check  this one out!"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Although the story has been told before, you get to see it with in a fresh new way. I loved the characters and storyline and cant wait to see more of it! Give it a shot!"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,The man does it again this was amazing part 2 will be even better
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Derivative, lacking any real character development and crowded with lazy exposition of an underdeveloped universe but it was fun to watch."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Una perdida total de tiempo, la historia no va a ning√∫n lado y las escenas de acci√≥n son innecesariamente ""lentas"""
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"üçÄ 1.6/10


I like the part we're the kayaiii Tentacle monster sucks that Walmart Cillian Murphy space nazis tit. Just like suicide squad 2016 nobody does anything and it's so annoying almost like it's multiple movie ideas showed in one it's so bad.
The main character's backstory was actually good should have been the actual film. The worlds in here look cool but are wasted. Each character gets a intro and each one is so bad and funny I really don't care about any character at all in here except the robot that dose literally nothing and the villain thats just has a certain presence. Also go read Nightendays review I'll put the link in the comments. Grade D-"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Rebel Moon ‚Äî Part One: A Child of Fire feels like a lackluster Star Wars copy, dedicating too much time to introducing numerous characters. Nonetheless, it's still overall entertaining with impressive visuals."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it and the set pieces. The story was simple but effective and I feel there is far more to it which will be explored in part 2. The important thing is delivered in what it promised entertainment and fun. Building a new universe is not easy and Rebel Moon delivered. Don't care what the critics have said I never do anymore they have been just pompous and abstract and I find most people don't care about their options anymore
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I am a hude fan of zack synders story telling, however after watching Rebel moon i felt like watching a prolog of a series and i was unable to connect with the movie. Few things are good about the movie. 

However, it cant save this movie.

Sophie's potreal was like lifeless and emotionless character.

Charlie's character doesn't impact anything.

Good things about the movie.

Roy's and Anthony's character i was directly related and was able to connect.

I liked Ed's negative character.

Few slows are very bad and does not make sense.

I really like the entry and fisrt flight of Starz scenes and slow mo.

However, my favourite movies will remain same.

BVS, ZSJL, MOS.

I hope zynders storytelling and half baked polt issues are fixed in next chapter Rebel Moon scargiver."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wtf is this!? I stopped after 50 minutes.... He put everything you have in the Sci-Fi genre into one movie, from Harry Potter to Star Wars, passing by the Hobbiton..... And it looks like a B movie! What was the budget? The original Blade Runner movie has better special effects than this !?
And it's really slow and boring, he's lucky Rebel Moon isn't showed in the theatres"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Maybe as a series it would have stood a chance, but this was just god awful.  Boring, obscenely predictable, unoriginal and the acting just sucked.  I really don't have very high standards for movies I like. I've watched Jupiter Ascending more than once, but this was worse than John Carter."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's like a Star wars wannabe ... Failing at almost everything.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great film from start to end! Develops characters, doesnt overwhelm you, and really good story line so far"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,This was awful. The writing was terrible. The plot made no sense. These user reviews have to be fake. Why would riding a hippogryph tame it? Why would there be a hippogryph in a sci-fi movie? Why would you want connan the barbarian to help you fight space marines? I don't even think he did anything other than waste 30 min of the movie. Worst movie I have seen in years
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Do you enjoy a good action movie with great visuals, a story told but gripping none the less, something to just watch and enjoy. Great scifi if you enjoy that kind of thing. Just a cool and entertaining watch. If you looking for a movie where you want to pick out references to a bunch of amazing movies that have been made, a reminder of great movies you might of seen. There's that to."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Rebel Moon, hit the hype train hard but missed the destination.

**Spoiler** it's going pretty well, a superb open narrative delivered by Anthony Hopkins. It's building our empathy right up to the point a villager is saved from sexual assault.
It's from this point on that it goes on it's magnificent 7 quest that ... Well it becomes devoid of script, any indication of amount of time passing.

****

I can tell you there's a Cora a General Titus and some other people in it who don't like the status quo, but you just don't really care to know because their back story's are delivered in perhaps 2 lines of script. That's. The core problem, you just don't care about the characters,because you don't know them. 

A very personal issue is an aesthetic, what the hell were they thinking with the primary antagonists hair cut. No wonder he's more than a little narky, every single reflective element in the world tells him he looks a right plonker!

There's lots of borrowing from other sci-fi universes, like 40k, Dune, Star Wars, Firefly, John Carter but what we get served from this mixed dish is ever so slightly underwhelming. It passes a few hours, it's mildly entertaining....

Over all you're left asking

""What the hell is the Mechanica Military thing doing as the film closes?"""
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Movie did not nearly live up to hype. Story was very formulaic. Visual effects were great but not enough to save.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not a new story but great visual and sound effects
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Lame.... again.. like a lamer avatar, but they didn't have to gingerly touch ""tails"" but lots of slow mow"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,More Battlefield Earth than Dune‚Ä¶
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Borrowing from several genres, this film is actually quite entertaining!  I look forward to part two far more than any Disney+ show (course this isn't saying much with Disney currently and the lack of compelling content).
Well worth watching Rebel Moon and great work Zack!"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"If Dune's little brother is Starwars this is surely their little sister. Its in the family, could have been better. The female lead was good but not exactly my cup'o'tea, although she fit the bill. The story is there but needed a little more time spent on the backstory, it seemed worth it. The action is good. Dialog is lacking, which effects the character, humor,  depth, and some regular conversation would be nice. 
The writers on this need help. The lack of quality dialogue and character development might be attributed to the writers union stand off. But all in all it was a B- film. More Character development, back story, and dialogue and you're looking at blockbuster."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,I can't cope with this much slow motion. Literally every action scene.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"You can always tell what kind of movie you're in for when people around it start calling it ""The next Star Wars"".

Usually a terrible one. Maybe they meant the next Book of Boba Fett.

What a poorly written, muddily filmed, ill considered, over acted, tedious waste of two hours. At least I can skip the second part."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The 1/2 star is for Charlie Hunnam who, although totally wasted in his role here, always gets something from me. Absolutely dreadful movie for the enormous cost spent that could have fed a beleaguered village or 5 for a few years."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It a good sifi movie, nice to see a new cool univers, can't wait for the next one üòÅ"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Throwing every SciFi movie to the wall and seeing what sticks with money as the paste doesn't make a movie good.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Everything everyone has said that is bad is absolutely true. And at the same time all that has been said about it being good‚Ä¶. Is also right. 
I'm split down the middle‚Ä¶. I pray üôè .. and pray and again üòÇ‚Ä¶   Part  two will be better and,  I know the movie afforded humans jobs so I will support. Consider it a introduction. 
As a audience were too spoiled to be fooled with lots of greenscence and slow cinematic shots that sometimes don't seem to connect. Even the female eye candy mood was not there ‚Ä¶. üòÇüòÇ"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Seemed stuck in a rut of repeating character introductions with obligatory action sequences... Has potential, its inspired but the notions havent been well worked into an interesting story."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is soo bad; the action scenes make no sense whatsoever. Bad guys are, once again, a mix of Nazis and Storm Troopers (they always miss).
Lines are cheesy, acting is mediocre, plot ""twists"" can be seen a mile away.
Save your time."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"ZS needs to stop. So many lazy tropes, stolen storylines. He should never write again. Visually, some parts are stunning but most of the ""story"" is cliched and boring. Characters aren't developed and you can totally see what his Star Wars pitch failed if this was it. He should work with great writers and producers in the future and never try to story tell."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I found the movie fun to watch. It for sure is a set up for multiple films.   I think the critics are not on point on this one and it's worth the watch and I can't wait for part 2
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was brilliant! I honestly do not understand the hate this movie is getting.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand why critics didn't like this flick.  It's visually stunning, every scene well thought out and portrayed.  The story is building as this is only PART ONE, so you *must* consider that when watching and immersing yourself into this beautiful film."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Don't believe the liars saying Rebel Moon is good, this is the worst garbage ever put on film. Ed Wood level trash, without the charming fun. Or any kind of fun. 

It's really bad, and there are so many better uses of your time. Clean your ears, or finally trim that hangnail, you'll get more entertainment from it."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,A hodgepodge of absolute garbage! Can you not be original with the characters or storytelling? The parallels with other movies was overly predictable and disappointing to say the least.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining movie! What a work of art! Must watch! 
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning, wonderfully paced, well acted. This movie was a blast and creative direction sets it apart from the movies it may have taken inspiration from."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Criminally underated for the first new sci-fi franchise in a decade.  Beautifully shot and an exciting intro and origin story for the main character who are all likeable.  I only didn't give it a fifth star because I'm scared to death the second part won't do justice to the first.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Nowhere near as original as The Creator, this is the most rousing sci-fi popcorn movie since Alita Battle Angel or the last Star Wars movie (and at a fraction of the cost).
I do see the negative pro reviews.  What I believe they miss is the need blockbuster movies work best by staying close to familiar archetypes and archetypal themes.  The quality has to mostly come from the commitment and dedication, in front of and behind the camera.  Nothing cheap here at all.  Rebel Moon has mountains of commitment and dedication so it works to engage audiences.  If you need more originality, go see The Creator."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,They ended the writers strike for this?
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Looked promising, then the story is all over the place there are so many dramatic moments with characters I know little so I don't care about any of them. Would've been better if it was a TV show."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent visuals. Good plot. Ready for part 2
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Sat and watched this with my wife,  we both loved it. I am a huge science fiction fan, she is not. 
Comparing the critic scores to the audience scores show unequivocally that ""critics"" have no clue what makes a good movie.

This film was fun to watch and I am looking forward to Part 2 next year."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Visually stunning & storytelling was bit slow but I enjoyed every action of it can't wait for part 2 . Zacktivated all along!
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the visual aesthetic of the worlds and characters.  Certain characters get far more focus on them than others which is a bummer for an ensemble flick but it's set up more like this would be the first half hour of ""let's get the crew together"" parts of movies spread into a 2 hour film serring up the sequel which, as shown in the trailer that plays after the movie ends, all those issues will be covered in the next film it seems.  This would be a bigger issue if the next movie didn't come out in just a few short months but here it just feels like part 1 of a TV special opening up a whole new universe I'd love to see more of.  It's like if Star Wars, Warhammer 40K and Seven Samurai had a baby and I'm here for it."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Lost interest about an hour in . We are going to tope an empire by recruiting 6 people. Huh? Boring!!!
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,It would have been nice to hear what people were saying WITHOUT the sound effect destroying my hearing.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Thin characters, incoherent story, & hilariously cringe dialogue. Some decent visuals sometimes though."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A big budget and decent cast completely wasted on what feels like an amateur director with a rich Dad.
There is little point to so much of this first installment. The energy put into this production would have been better spent on a project like Firefly or Cowboy Bebop, where writing and characters stayed core to the focus.
There was room for subtly within the grand adventure, but it was reduced to obvious and overstated sentiments and violence without consequence.
Very poor."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was a lot of fun. The visual style was just breathtaking and was just a fun, action packed adventure story."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"1 hr. 25 min in, of a 2 hr. and 4 min movie, and I feel no connection whatsoever to *any* of the characters. No connection at all to any, even at least one character, definitely makes it a struggle to watch  The visuals are great but the story and pace struggle and fails to grab, much less keep my attention. Sofia Boutella's acting... just not believable. I see why she doesn't have many lines in other movies. The trailer will trick you, you cant get this time back. I was really excited to watch this one, was...."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So many of the action sequences are slow-motion gratuitous wastes of screen time.  They would be more interesting at full speed than slow-motion, but even then they're unnecessary.

There are such gaping plot holes... like people who claim to fight for honor and then betray their ideals for no apparent reason.  

And has no one in this universe ever heard of a radio?"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,What a load a shite!!!
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not the best movie but I like it and I want to see next parts
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Whoever these critics are, its bs they can say the movie is not well recieved.. when audience score is way greater than critics it shows biase.. the movie graphics CGI and storyline is perfect. Everyone plays their part perfectly."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Full of fantastic visuals, excellent world building and epic storytelling. I can't wait to watch the sequels and see how the story progresses."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've seen the complaints of the critics. I can see the slight indications of what they say. Overall, it was great. I think the critics are working too hard and watching too many movies/shows. They lack the pure joy of a well-made movie, despite the symptoms repeated in other movies."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film was a story of an epic adventure. A story of redemption, sacrifice, and most of all revenge. It was at times breathtakingly emotional but the action and fighting sequences were the most resounding. I really enjoyed it and I can't wait to see part 2."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie has a good history and amazing screenshots.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wow, that was bad!!!!"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed it.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wasn't bad. But wasn't really good. 
Had to pause it three times to figure out how much time was left in the movie, just felt so exhausting to watch it, felt like a chore it sit though it all. For a sci fi film, was kinda boring.  To many characters, with to much backstory(felt confusing at times)."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Not a very creative movie. Predictable from beginning to end.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Looks so expensive and at the same time so cheap. What a medicre movie.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It was really cool. Finally some new stuff can't wait for the sequels and ratedR version.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is hot garbage. There might be some interesting visuals sure, but the story is trash, the acting is mediocre, and it watches like no one continuity checked the script. This seems like fodder for someone to tear apart on YouTube as a trash film."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,An amazing movie. I can't wait for part two! Revolutionary storyline! A+ for originality! One bad ass movie!
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Starts off interesting but slowly wears you down as the movie goes on. The dialog was terrible. The characters are super shallow characters who are basically just names along with a trope. The action was fine but not worth having to watch the non action parts. I wanted to like it, but it was just a really bad movie."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The universe in this movie is darker, more interesting, and scarier than the Star Wars universe.
Though the characters aren't as charismatic, I disagree with the critics, it's a story rich with potential."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I believe everyone has become so super critical that the ability to simply enjoy a well done movie is almost lost. This movie was visually pleasing from the opening scene to closing. I‚Äôve heard that the pacing was either to slow or to fast, i on the other hand didn‚Äôt have an issue because as i stated i watched for enjoyment not as a critic. The acting and character development was exactly what was to be expected from a movie building a new universe and franchise. If you go into this movie to enjoy a good movie you will be pleased. With any movie even your favorite movie if you go in with the idea to pick apart anything you don‚Äôt like then no movie will ever meet your standards. This was written by a fan of cinema not a critic "
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Uninteresting or compelling characters or story. Everything looks very 'cool' but lacks any depth that makes it interesting.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Rushed with very little character development and barely any storytelling.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No character building, no creativity, predictable and zero redeemable qualities. It leaves no reason for even caring about a sequel. All the budget went to being visually entertaining but the dialogue was sooooo weak. Epic bad. I had to apologize to others for asking to watch it."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I quite enjoyed the movie. I can definitely see how this could have been a star wars movie. Changing out some characters for others such as General Titan for Mac Windu or Prince Tarak for Luke. While not the main characters in the film they are still important ones. I'm looking forward to Part II. There was some parts of the movie that seemed likely or obvious but itt is still enjoyable if you like Sci Fi.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie! Very enjoyable to watch and entertaining.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Very good, excited to see where this new universe goes."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Was a entertaining movie overall had fun watching the new worlds and action was fun. Just a bit that the antagonist needed more beating lol.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Very enjoyable Zach synder movie expect slow mo's for sure but characters looked kool action was dope love the sci fi setting world seems big and interesting can't wait for sequel to expand on it‚Ä¶..alot of people saying they can't follow the story or we don't know enough about these characters and that's kinda lame cuz story was very basic bad empire threaten village and protagonist goes on quest to find help to fight back sound like a video game which I love and easy to follow and movie was made to tease at things to come because it's obviously a series so I thought it was done fine to peek my interest to Learn and see more in future
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's Battle Beyond the Stars meets Warhammer. Very amateurish writing with barely enough character development to understand why any of these ""heroes"" are willing to risk their lives fighting for a people nearly none of them have any ties to. It has incredible visual effects. But CG does not turn a bland film into an epic."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The first half is Star Wars episode 4, the second half is Akira Kurosawa 7 samurai. And in not a good way. You have picky nazi Blinder as the Main villain, a lot of edgy dialogue and no chemistry at all betwen the characters. Aside Kora I couldn't remember any of the others characters names and it's only because it sounds very familiar to ""Korra"". Absolute scifi garbage. At least it has some decent visual moments."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Has action and fulfills its role of entertaining.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Not a single thing I didn't like... Really not sure why it has such poor critic reviews.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"After watching this, this movie has nothing but exposition dump. The visual were impressive. So much slo-mo. Unnecessary slo-mo scene like characters doing normal activities as throwing seeds. Creatures look cool. Story was bland. Not enough time to get to know each Characters we were introduced to. I'm curious for part 2 and director's cut for part 1."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,I really like the movie.. I can not wait for the second part and and the directors cut but I recommend it!!
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's big and bombastic and wears its influences on its sleeves. I was left wanting much more
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Starts well but quickly falls off once the ""team building"" starts. Visually impressive moments, but the plot‚Ä¶ üòëü´†.

I'm convinced if they removed all the slow motion action moments (buckle up, there are a ton to the point it becomes comical), this would be a 90 minute film."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I watched it with low expectations, I think that worked in its favor, although it's still unsatisfactory. It's a stumbling movie that doesn't quite know how to structure the story it wants to tell, and it simply manages by ellipses and flashbacks inserted inorganically, to try to drive the entire story behind it a little. All the interactions between characters are lost, and in the end, you don't care about them. The best thing that can be said about this movie is that it doesn't make you feel like you've wasted your time, but it doesn't evoke any emotion, you feel nothing once it's over, it just ends. With the announcement of a second part, let's hope it doesn't disappoint us like this."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was the worst movie I have seen in a long, long time. I can't remember a movie off the top of my head that was as trashy as this. The graphics look like a low budget video game, the acting was shockingly bad, and it's basically like watching a bunch of loosely woven vignettes with o my the barest hint of unifying story. If they cut out the endless, gratuitous slow motion scenes, it would have shaved about thirty minutes off the movie. It is a poor rip-off of Star Wars, and was utterly abysmal. No redeeming qualities. If you value your time, skip it."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Good Job setting up the future. I think it will all come together in the end. He has a vision.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I thought it was pretty good it was a bit slow to start and maybe I was a little to excited for it to come out so I expected like "" best movie ever"" status. It was not quite there for me.  Worth the watch for sure."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic sci-fi with an old western type story anbout assembling a team of badasses to fight off the bad guys. Dazzling special effects and plenty of laser blast action. Completely enjoyable.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Way too slow, not much character development to even be invested in their outcome. Overall, pretty disappointing."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es una excelente pel√≠cula que se nota que es una historia dividida en 2 partes. La primera parte cumple con dejarte a la expectativa de lo que suceder√° mas adelante. tambi√©n el worldbuilding es un plus de esta nueva ip que nace. estoy muy interesado por conocer cada esquina de ese mundo. Kora es una badass y de verdad representa el verdadero empoderamiento femenino, sin dar lastima, al contrario, siendo empoderada con grandes talentos y una gran actitud ante la vida. ¬°Muy recomendado!"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's not winning any Oscar's, but will definitely watch again and excited for part two. Hit a lot of nostalgia for me, of bygone sci-fi of the 70s and 80s."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly, this movie is phenomenal. Such a great start to what appears to be a great collection coming soon. A rebel moon fan emerged today and this the first time in my life I have taken the time to write a review."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun flick, looked great, enjoyed the story. Looking forward to part 2."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is a lot of fun. Amazing visuals and great action/fight scenes. Really cool story that leaves you wanting more.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I want more! Great start.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed the movie I am looking forward to seeing the longer version. 

This was shot almost completely on green screen with CGI for pretty much everything. 

I agree it has overtones of many different ideas. 
Nazis 
Vikings
Amish
Star wars
Farscape
Babylon 5
And much more. 

Realize that considering the restrictions placed on him for the movie it's better than I expected.
I look forward to the next two movies and then the director cuts for all three which I suspect considering Sniders other directors cuts will be even better. 

Give it a chance and realize if your looking for award winning movie this is not it. 
If your looking for an enjoyable movie that is definitely different and is trying to do much more with a lot less like farscape and Babylon 5 then I suspect you may enjoy this."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Critics are missing out on this movie, The plot is the predictable retold story of the rebellion against another evil empire. But the characters of the rebellion,  and their quest for help are as entertaining as the first viewing of Star Wars. It's refreshing and captures your imagination again. Life repetes itself often, so don't let the Critics tell you this story can't be told again. It's a cool movie, and if you love syfy, you will love this."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So, the visuals and armor made me think this was an MMO adaptation. Turns out, no it just looks straight of WoW or even RuneScape. The characters are characterless. The ""people"" are literally as one dimensional caricatures. The fight choreography is hilariously awful. I'm shocked this exists, honestly."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,I can't get past the fact that the story line is almost exact like the movie A Bugs Life mixed with a little Star Wars.  Fun and entertaining but same story.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Muy buena. Excelente.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Finally a show that takes SyFy and Star Wars making a story you can engage in and feel like Yes !
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Such a wasted premise.  So much time spent on slow motion and super slow motion that would have been better used for actual character and plot development.  The entire plot is collecting the party of people to fight the evil empire.  But they don't have ships.  It doesn't make sense.  One character cautions the dangers of revenge and the very next character collection is motivated by ""how about revenge?"".  How does something this bad get made?"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visually nice, storyline very basic"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The storyline of movie is so predictable, offering nothing fresh or engaging.

*"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely awful. Nothing redeeming. CGI is bad, story is bad, acting is bad. Just terrible."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun movie! Lots of action and yes it borrowed from so many other movies but if you love sci fi you'll appreciate it. If you aren't a pretentious knob and miss the good old days of movies that were actually entertaining then I guarantee you'll love this! Can't wait for Part 2!
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed the movie and can't wait for the rated r cut
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entertaining, expansive, good cast, looks great to watch and has its own twists on expected genre themes and characters. A fun scifi adventure that's worth a first and repeat watch."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No character building, interesting premise but they butchered the execution. Those are 2 hours I'm not getting back"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was like a poorly reimagined warhammer 40k. The soldiers look like knock off imperial guard. The slayed king just basically feels like the dead emperor. Guns look just like bolters. I mean it's a blatant rip off and a garbage one at that. dialog is just poorly written, the protagonist is probably the worst of everyone's . The action is horrible don't use axes and knives if you aren't going to blood or wounds it just look like practice sessions. The guns aren't build right and the again the protagonist can barely hold it without it wobbling all over the place. This is just the first half, the just filled with cliches and tropes that are already over used and mashed together is such a dull way. This director needs to stay away from the writing. waste of two hours."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Not perfect. But i had a blast watching it.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Waited a year to watch Rebel Moon - A Child of Fire, instead recieved a updated version of Battle Beyond the Stars with a few more grunts.  Despite this comparison there were some good character development, fast pace action, and Sofia Boutella did an amazing job as did Ed Skrein."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A river of ponderous, overwrought CGI wrapped around the same dull ""poor little AI robots"" trope that made Creator so monotonous. Watching it felt like being force-fed talking points by OpenAIs marketing department."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it! The opening scene was eye candy, the battles were epic and the story twist was exactly what i wanted! I have theories about Kora and the... but i won't spoil it for other..."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing.  Can't wait for Director's cut
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was a good movie. Great cast and action. Sure it has its faults, lots of plot armor for main characters and some inexplicable moments in general but I'd like to see more of this universe. Very much Warhammer 40k meets Star Wars. Awesome designs for ships, armor, weapons and planets. Needs to be fleshed out more but this was a good start, strong female lead, not some damsel in distress. The whole cast needs to be more expressive though, I know now they are trying to be under the radar but it would be better to see them being more active. Backstory would have been a better place to start for the main and some support characters but a fun watch nonetheless and a visual treat. I would have like to see more from Jimmy but I guess most of that was cut?
 I hope they spend more time laying out the history of this galaxy and maybe why the king was slain to put things into perspective. It seems like there was so much more that led into this situation in the film that was not expounded upon that it becomes muddled. Was the original empire good or bad? What was the struggle initially? I have a lot of questions but hopefully they can be answered in the future in film/series formats. Comic tie-ins seem lazy to me for exposition, do a book if needed."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was really good, enjoyed it I'm not like everyone whose only concern is visual effects and looking for every tiny or unnoticeable movie detail flaws. It was entertaining and amazing enjoyable movie for (me)."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was as if chat bot wrote it.  Clear mish-mosh assembly of tropes/characters recently reused ideas and imagery.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Can't wait to see how this story progresses.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,A bit too much rampant plagiarism to be comfortable with. Or to forgive. Two and a half stars because it's some scifi that is not Marvel or Disney.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Very entertaining üëè
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was extremely derivative and failed to make be believe the stakes in several scenes. Also the repeated use of sexual assault as a theme is kinda creepy.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Solid acting, entertaining. Media critics are all wrong, they would have given the original Star Wars a 10% if it came out today by the way they have reviewed this."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I can't believe I watched this film for what felt like an eternity to see the worst parts of gladiator, a new hope, prisoner of Azkaban, and rip offs of Warhammer 40K plowed into a confused and lack luster design style that felt good until it doesn't."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Okay, I flat out loved this. Yes, it ""borrows"" from so many sources and it's far too easy to pick them out but I didn't care because it was just what I was in the mood for. My subwoofer got quite the workout. I don't know if there are scenes they cut for time but I'm sure a longer version would probably be even better but I'm happy with what we got."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Pretty much a mess. Story line was a joke. Dialogue was disappointing at best. Special effects were good but they should have saved some money to write a better script.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,A fun movie with good action. A little slow to start but it picks up.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you like Star Wars and Dune, this is worth a watch."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I watched the teaser for the first time and liked it. I secretly think of the Dun war. and Jupiter movie Plus Seven Samurai Plus Warhammer 40K Every inhabited planet has problems. It's fun to fight.ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ 
PS. I waiting Director Cut Rate R ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's the beginning. 
I'm waiting for the long version."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,The whole thing felt sloppily put together. There was no character development. The characters spoke to each other like they had a history when they literally just met. It was a big let down.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Dirt farmers with automatics doors on their homes but no modern tools?  Space Nut Sees (I kid you not) with no discipline.  The whole thing simultaneously look cheap and super expensive all at the same time.  Welcome to Rebel Moon.  Also, grabbing another man by the stick and balls in a sexual context when there is not consent is not funny or cool."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Looks great. Action is good. Writing and direction doesn't appear to have any direction or thought. Fun, though."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A real lack of any depth given other than a brief description of who they are to a rapidly introduced group of characters. It started ok but soon became a rushed soulless movie, leaving me without a care for any of the main characters let alone the bland done to death plot. A real shame really could have been so much more."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie. My only complaint is that there isn't enough character development. They assemble a team that took little convincing to join their cause and we don't learn a whole lot about them. It otherwise had a good story, nice action sequences, cool world designs, and I enjoyed the show-mo moments. I'm looking forward to part two."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Drama without context, not worth the calories."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Good cast, interesting premise, no expenses spared with CGI and costume design, but by the end of the 2 hour run time it all collapses under the weight of a poor screenplay.  Felt like a film student project that just ripped off existing movies, and tried to cram so many things into two hours at the expense of any character or world building beyond a few lines of cheap exposition.

It started out okay, then started to feel bad and by the end I felt angry at giving up two hours of my life while at the same time I found myself laughing at how bad the last line uttered in the movie was.

I enjoyed reading reviews of people thrashing this movie more than the movie itself at least."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If you took Star Wars, Dune, Avatar, Harry Potter Maze Runner, Hunger Games and just about any sci-fi of the past 60 years and ripped out random tropes mixed with a tired and worn, but tried and true plot of a rebel against an all controlling evil empire you have rebel moon. Visually interesting but marked by clear cgi shortcuts it's worth a watch compared to whatever other unoriginal rehashed drivel is being produced lately."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun action, good story, there was a little bit of bad dialogue but overall great movie"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is a great sci-fi movie, fun , entertaining and the CGI is excellent. The story is well written and the actress and actors bring the story to life. I know some wanted a R rated version but I think the PG-13 version is really good. It's definitely a movie the family can enjoy together. This is a Cowboy Star Wars movie .. like the original Star wars a New Hope had bad reviews but everyone loved the movie Don't listen to the critic's ,listen to the the audience."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visually stunning, but hollow film"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,A good science fiction beginning of a universe. Surprisingly entertaining and can't wait for the unrated version and part 2 of the story. The only thing holding it back was the amount of slow motion used in every action scene but other than that is pretty good üëç
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,better than star wars
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,excelente trama vamos haber que mas hay esta super emocionante y se va generando una historia que falta mas por contar . pero excelente me encanto
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Entertaining, but nothing really original."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It's much better than what I thought. Casting was great üëçüèº
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Star wars movies need these type of action scenes truly unique amazing fighting sequences. Zack never stops being creative with action scene and i cant get enough
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,My god come up with something original! This is a battle beyond the stars remake.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Story is good . Nice flow. Visually interesting and easy to follow
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Little slow to start but great action and special effects. Star Wars meets 300!!
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"√ìtimo filme, ja estou esperando o pr√≥ximo..."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The most cringe dialog this side of Xena Warrior Princess. Oh yeah the story sucks too, sophomoric plot, that is transparent and meandering."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The truth about #RebelMoon is that it's okay. Not bad, not great, just okay/slash somewhat good. It's SW with more violence and less fun. 7/10"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was specifically written to be a Star Wars spinoff, so if you don't expect some familiar aesthetic you just don't understand the spirit of things. This film was terrific, I never wanted it to end, and I can't wait for part 2. Yeah it's dark and serious. I like dark. Gritty. This movie scratched a whole lot of itches."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This thing is a mess, a little entertaining, nothing that stretches your brain."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Incredible movie possibly Zack Snyder's best film yet incredible. Casting incredible story and I'm excited to see part two.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Lacking in internal consistency, character depth, and generally feels like it was make to tick boxes, not be a cohesive story"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Based upon the critic reviews, basically every single superhero movie with an origin story in the last 15 years should be one star.  This is how a Space Opera starts, it is exactly how it is supposed to be.  I hope to see more."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Loves the shots in this movie!  Action was pretty epic as well.  Excited to see the next one!
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Idk what's up with the RT score being 21% from starting off at a 9%. That's kinda insane. I thought this movie was awesome. The story is a classic Seven Samurai/Knights of the round table kind of team up movie to protect the planet Veldt. Kora and Gunnar set off in search of help and it takes off from there. The pacing is a bit off in the middle of the movie and I feel like a lot of the extended cut will show what we missed out on. But the first and third acts are the strongest. The visuals were out of fucking hand. The flashback scene when Kora dives into her past was one of the best and I was just in awe of how this movie looked. Al there were establishing shots that were as epic as some in Lord of the Rings. At times it felt inspired by a Cronenberg movie with the alien and technology infused aliens. Jimmy the robot was also a great character and I can't wait to see what the extended rated R cut will show as well as Part II : The Scargiver. Also not to forget is the sets, costumes, props, vehicles were awesome. Junkie XL's score complimented the movie so well and hit just right when it needed to.. I suggest watching and deciding for yourself but I think it's a good movie with plenty of rewatch-ability."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"3/4 of this film was soooo slow and boring! The fight scene in the village, the scene against the spider and the end of the film were the best bits if you could call them that. Lucky that I gave it a two star rating. Adult version of Starwars someone called this....What a joke....Any of the Starwars franchise's is better than this! I wouldn't waste you time or money watching this movie."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun, exciting and engaging! Really enjoyed it!"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Absolutely Boring. Zero Action. Weak Story.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I love that movie and the slow scenes. I like the action and if you like the action you won't get bored. I really love it.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was great tbh.  Not as good as Dune, but way better than any Star Wars movie.  I'll be looing forward to part 2 dropping in 2024."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Visually outstanding but lacked a cohesive storyline. Would love much more back story on all the main characters. I'm guessing if there is a Directors Cut everything will be fleshed out much more. Still very entertaining!!
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Watch it for yourself.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,this was one of the best movies this year! I don't know why rottentomatoes' criticism is so bad big L
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was really good. I read some reviews of people criticizing it but it was all petty. It was one of the better movies I have seen in a while, can't wait for the next part to come out."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,An absolute disaster of stolen storylines and over produced CGI.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not sure if there are a lot of AI bots bombing the reviews as they all sound the same. Also, I'm not sure why there are so many Star Wars references. There are only seven story archetypes and yes they are both following similar tropes but so does any movie about the little guy fighting the big bad.

The movie itself wasn't perfect but it was enjoyable to watch and worth recommending. The characters are interesting and the action scenes were well done. I will say it is the best sci-fi movie I've seen this year."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I feel there was not a single original idea in this sucker punch of a film, so many old earth accents and not a decent bit of dialogue to be heard. It has a hobbit village, a princess, Conan turns up and does nothing. The greatest general of the age is found and spouts a couple of bad speeches and at one point Jar Jar is seen. Even the visuals are stolen. The bad guys and their weapons are straight out of Warhammer 40k and then the awful out of place OTT music score is trying to punch above it's weight. Another case of great trailer shame about the Film.

See if you can spot the stormtroopers who still can't hit anything and even the Emperor makes an appearance lool."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Refreshing to see something from this genre not tied to Star Wars... I know it was originally supposed to be but so glad they they took it in a different direction... Definitely recommend it to people who like sci-fi movies...
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The acting was horrible, the characters are unimaginative, it's like a sci-fi knockoff of magnificent 7 remake. Such a fantastic cast but the story bored me to death had to push myself to finish the movie and not go watch something more interesting"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wow, we can discuss some of Disney's questionable decisions about Star Wars...  I really wanted to like this film, but thank the maker for whoever at Lucasfilm/Disney passed on this really pedestrian movie.  They made a VERY good decision!  There's very little if anything new in this film, near zero character development."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Every aspect about it is bad, there is no character development, it is a blunt copy of Star Wars, and the dialogue is trash."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Star wars ripoff? Absolutely
 Worth watching? Absolutely. Some of the CGI was a little poor and some of the characters were a bit derivative (pretty standard girl boss lead knocking ppl out with stick figure arms and female Japanese character who uses swords, to name a couple). Character development definitely lacking - for example who the hell is this general and why is he so angry? No idea. But overall it was visually engaging, and had an extremely good villain along with solid action sequences.

I'm excited to see the next in the series"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A somewhat middling movie. It took a big shot and I felt it missed the net for the most part. It tries to set up an appealing universe without providing nearly enough context or information. There are a number of characters who just seem to do things not because they make sense but because the script wants them to. 

While visually pretty I feel like there was an over reliance on slow motion effects that took away from the film, among other odd visual choices. The main one that stood out to me involved a fight breaking out after a young girl is threatened with SA where there was a decent amount of unpleasantness surrounding what happens to the girl on screen to then transition to a fight scene involving axes and knives with not a single bit of blood nor wounds in sight. 

Just an odd film that felt like it had certain points on a checklist it had to hit but not much else to it."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Disappointed. Awkward dialogue, poor pacing and cheesy fight sequences. No feel of direction. Mildly entertaining but it's really just another Sci-fi rebellion movie but poorly executed on almost every aspect."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a good version of 7 Samurai... in space! It is visually stunning, there was a seed for a great universe we were introduced to is something I can't wait to learn more about, and I am more than interested in seeing how this universe expands as there are more movies, comics, books, and more introduced!"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I liked the plot,  storyline and awesome visuals, but the movie lacked character development. I am sure the R rated version will be much better,  with more background on our heroes.  The action is well filmed,  but there isn't much action onscreen to keep you alert. With that being said,  this version had missing scenes and you can tell there isn't enough meet on the bone. Looking forward to seeing the uncut version soon üòÄ"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,This is theater quality I would be happy to pay for. Looking forward to the director's cut!!!
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's a basic movie with subpar acting. The actors seemed to know this movie sucked. It doesn't have the edge of your seat suspense it thinks it does. The introduction of parts of the plot and character back stories is just thrown in and forced. It's not very smooth.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's barely watchable.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's Warhammer 40K meets Firefly meets SW. I dig it.  Visuals are beautiful.  Story develops and is a good first step toward something cool. Critics,  lol like the world actually cares what you say.  Usually if Critics don't like it is a good watch. Rock on Rebel Moon!"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, ignore the critics."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think the idea of a ""critic"" has been lost. Surely a ""critic"" should judge anm movie so the potential audience can make an educated decision on whether to watch a movie based on an expert opinion. But I'm seeing more and more disparity between ""audience"" scores and ""critic"" scores.
If the two metrics are so far apart, what is the point in the ""critic""? They're obviously completely unaware of what the audience wants and basing their opinion on some other measure of ""entertain-ability"" 
I'm starting to think that the ""critics"" are solely looking for arty-farty, deep and meaningful, artistic, socially - real world questioning films which are inherently boring, frustrating and completely missing the objective of cinema... which is to escape the real world for 90 minutes, not to be reminded of life's stuggles and leave the cinema less depressed than when we arrive."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing world creation, visual, VFX and the Seven Samurais vibe was really interesting. Therefore, the directors cut and the sequel should fill the lack of character development of the movie. Aldo, this doesnt prevent the movie from being a very competent and promising iteration. Very well settled up to the sequel"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great film with interesting characters and world. Although similar to other films in the style of big bad comes to small town. Small town seeks help. This kept me tuned in right through and I wanted to find out more about the characters and the world they are in. I loved the art style of the film.. Although alot of reviews complained about the over use of slow motion I felt it suited the style and was used at the right moments to capture the feel. This isn't fast and furious where its action over style and depth. This is about style, depth and visuals. This is a great new film series where hopefully we see more world building."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"La pel√≠cula transmite esa esencia de ZS si te gusta su trabajo la disfrutar√°s mucho, no puedo esperar a ver como contin√∫a esta saga"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"ZS is good when directly adapting a story (300 & Watchmen) yet still always has issues with pacing his movies. When it comes to world building and making his own stories though, he's really bad. 

This movie for example, took him an hour to flesh out the premise. Took 30 mins to pick up new characters without any character backgrounds or motivations, no chemistry or interactions between characters. Then all of a sudden there's the obvious and predictable betrayal and quick switch to climax. 

Then there's the always dark world. Even when the sun's up the world is still somehow dark. Also don't get me started with his addiction to slow motion which happens every ten seconds and in every flashback when there's absolutely no need for it."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Well, any slower start and I would have thought this movie was about Amish Space Farmers...
Secondly, the pacing of the movie is trash.
Thirdly, the script is horrendous. 

""Let's find warriors to fight a planetary Army'""
"" And we'll start with you 4 clowns....""

This movie sucks."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great VFX, carefully crafted photography, beautiful scenes, and a very compelling story, highly recomended."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is a movie that has a lot of build-up but leads you nowhere. It's a very typical great soldier that doesn't want to fight but is forced to story. You can tell it's inspired by Stars Wars. It is a very predictable movie. This movie is not good at all.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"A lot of people advertised this film as a Star wars clone. Im a big sci-fi/Star Wars fan and I can see it's a very different world and storytelling. To be honest, I had a better time watching Rebel Moon: The Girl o Fire than watching the last Star Wars trilogy."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Better than most of what Disney has put out in the last decade.  Visually superior to every thing Star Wars.  

Most of the hate this has gotten so far is unwarranted and childish to say the least."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The modern version of 7 samurai! 

Highly recommended!"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I think it was a very good movie. Sci-do and fantasy is my jam. I know a lot of comparisons will be made but I didn't feel that way at all. I feel some people feel threatened to say films are good because they are in the same genre as other films they love. 8.5 out of 10
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action packed! The main character is a badass! If you can't get enough sci-fi, you have to see this!"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What an awful movie. Just a morass of sci-fi bs we've seen for years now. Weak plot, unimaginative action sequences, the 90 lbs lead actress is unconvincing as a ferocious fighter, every bad character is fat, ugly and slovenly and every good character is thin and handsome. And everyone is wearing too much makeup"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed it. Like to see the Synder cut of it too.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It's awesome!!! The heck with the naysayers all movies are drawn from something and this is best since Star Wars!!!!
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great fun, action packed and visually fantastic...watch for yourself...those not entertained should stick to soap operas. Critics have shown time and time again that they know very little about what people like in movies. People want entertainment and this movie provides just that"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,brilliant what a film
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Looks amazing, characters are all very interesting and it left me wanting more but satisfied with what I got to watch."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's nowhere near the quality of other recent space operas and its cinematography feels dated (imagine the 300, with slightly less slo-mo scenes). The characters and storyline aren't *too* terrible, but they never really pulled me in. It's an okay Friday night watch, but don't expect anything special."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics don't know what they are talking about. Lol they hate anything that's good or different. They hate everything that we love, they don't have one unique bone in their body. I love it and can't wait for part 2!"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,too much slow motion....dull...seemed like a dollar tree version of star wars.....I was stoked to watch but within 10 minutes I turned it off....went back and tried to get through it a few more times but it's just not good.....and I love science fiction movies.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It couldn't be more boring. Narrative long, tedious and take us nowhere. Visual effects excessive used. I've just lost hours of life."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Even though the story line blended a bunch of high action stories, it kept me engaged and entertained. I will definitely watch part 2"
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The only good thing about this movie was that it convinced me to sign in to RT for the first time and tell others just how bad it was. And man was it bad! All the money was spent on visual effects and costume, which were good but honestly not amazing. The story however was really awful. Instead of creating something original they decided to plagiarize from many sci-fi and fantasy sources. The dialog was also wooden and cheesy, most likely due to the weak story. At least it was free"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Story is a little rushed, but it didn't feel politically charged, I enjoyed the overall story, epic picture. Critics just don't like it because it was purely for entertainment."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Alot of things to enjoy here sit back with some popcorn and remember what fun watching a spectacle is.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a good movie for a part 1. Will see once part 2 just how good this movie can be.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is a been there done that Sci Fi movie with same ole story line. The plot is just thin and there really isn't anything of interest that occurs over the entire story arc. It's a nicely shot movie with decent cast, just lacked any character development and seems like it was written by a teenager."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Please make it illegal for these writers to write another script.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't see how it is possible that it only got 22%. I totally disagree and thought it was well done & really enjoyed it.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Too much slow mo, other than that an ok movie. Just too much slow motion in the action scenes."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie has a pretty decent story and good visual effects. Great popcorn movie to sit and watch with the family. Critic reviews really don't mean anything anymore so don't let their reviews deter you from a great popcorn flick.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The dialogue and acting can be a bit corny and forced at times but it's supposed to be like Star Wars so it fits. There's no real story arc, it seems to just be setting up the characters and world. It's not really a 5 star movie but it was good enough that I want to see the sequels. All of Zack Snyders trilogy plans get shot down before they can take off. It'd be nice to see one get off the ground. Also as a Star Wars nerd, it's nice to see a Star Wars that's not a Disney movie. To sum up it's not spectacular but I would like to see more."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Saw it 3 Times in a row already. It's a gorgeous looking film. Loving this fresh approach to the sci-fi genre. I cannot wait for the 2nd part of the rebel moon saga and curious to see the extended cut of both films if there is to be one.  If you're a fan of avatar, blade runner, dune, firefly, Star Wars, mad max or even the matrix you will enjoy rebel moon. Highly recommend."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie has great cinematography and the story is better than what some of the critics state.  Have a sneaking suspension the poor ratings is a combined effort by the mouse house/KK to bring down any Star Wars competition.  I give this movie 5 stars.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a visual and very good history.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,I feel like this movie just takes bits and pieces out of movies. I've already seen before like Harry Potter with the hippogriff and the light saber swords really got me very unoriginal.
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Nothing original in this movie and a lack luster sound track.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,The story needs more time and character needs more development which I'm sure we will get in director's cut and even still it's better than star wars
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story telling and action, very impressive and recomendable"
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed it. Visually a beautiful movie. The story was too light with so many characters. I have to believe the directors cut will flesh that out. Few characters definitely deserved it. Hard to judge when it's incomplete. So, we'll see."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ouf!!! Arghhh...what a terrible patchwork of so many good movies. I think there is strictly nothing original in this 2+ hour mishap.
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie packs stunning visuals and incredible fights. I think people expect a space drama with deep characters, but it is more of an epic adventure. The best way to describe it is to take 300 and combine it with Dune, add just the right amount of head nods to Star Wars and Gladiator and you have this film. It leaves me excited about the future of this franchise. Good Stuff, good stuff indeed."
"Dec 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Worth a watch. Not the worst, not the best. Visual's are gorgeous. Dialogue and story are ok. Character personal interaction was sparse."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie is way to long for the amount of information presented and the story told, it is very disjointed and honestly boring to watch, None of the characters are interesting enough to care about or want to know more about, and are honestly very generic."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Rebel Moon Part one:

A visually stunning movie, whose biggest d√©traction is probably an overuse of ""slow time"", I find it to be an enjoyable popcorn flick with a story that combines science fiction and fantasy like a pulp novel combined with a tabletop RPG campaign"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Movie was so trash. Boring. Wooden protagonist. Good guys are idiots. I would rather seen movie about the king and queen that got slayed by the assassin.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I got bored of it halfway through. It feels like it's stealing lots of aspects from different movies, yet captures none of the soul of it. It feels like it's going through the motions but there's nothing behind it"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Yeah this just wasnt any good
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was brilliant, fresh, and something different, there's so many sheep saying it's bad just because they hear others say it's bad without even taking it in properly. I cannot wait for the next films, comics games and story to unfold."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Another amazing film. Leave this man alone and let him cook.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It's a great fun movie to watch. Stunning visuals. Fight choreography is also good. The story is just okay. This is a sci fi Roman Empire style film at its core.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I like the movie. It's epic and hugely exciting!  Don't let the reviews from the so called pro's influence you!
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,I really liked it but it did feel rushed at moments and it needed more time with the characters because it's the first movie so I expected to know more about all the characters properly
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie was pretty bad. The writing was bad. The editing was bad. The movie felt like they just threw a bunch of scenes together in the hopes that the audience would just follow along like ""oh, sure"". 
It's a shame because I really liked the idea of it. People can compare it to whatever franchise they want to, as it pulled from many. But this was just a bad film. I was rolling my eyes at dialogue, confused about characters motivations and got bored with the ridiculous amount of ""let's just make this scene look cool rather than putting any creative work into it"". 
Won't watch again and won't recommend anyone else to do so."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Rebel Moon Part 1 A Child Of Fire Is a combination of sci-fi and fantasy with a breathtaking musical score filled with hope, power & creativity at its core. The mission of the rebel force is laid out at the beginning & each character is unique and engaging with their own capabilities and motivations meshing together as one as they collide in an epic battle lifestyle. There are also plenty of twists & turns throughout the movie to keep one at the edge of their seats! The full movie experience is in two parts, the second movie to come out April 19th, 2024. This 'part one' is an excellent introduction to a new sci-fi fantasy adventure!"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Felt like a live action FinalFantasy. Liked it a lot.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is so bad that theories of AI writing exist.  The language is pompous and non-communicative.  Large exposition dumps are interrupted by comic-book speech bubbles that propel the plot from action scene to action scene, which alone is a break from utter boredom.  The actors are top notch, the CGI is good for a streaming movie, the story has been lifted from the Seven Samurai which was reworked as the Magnificent Seven, but to no avail.  Both those films created tension and an interest in the Ronin or gun-fighters.  Not so here, where their cardboard nature is as real as the blue screen the actors stand in front of.  It completely lacks substance."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great world and visuals.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Rebel moon is very entertaining visually stunning and the Action is great
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,The dialogue is just awful and can we please have a limit on how many times you can use the anamorphic lens flare!
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Wonderful exciting movie. Much better than Star Wars. Loved it. Fantastic cast.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Something i üëç Mix of everything.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie critics are liers
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was an excellent start to this new universe. Looking forward to part 2.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"There is nothing original in this movie but don't be put off by the 'so called' professional critics. Generally the acting is fine, the visual effects are fine, the movie being over 2 hours runs at pace so you are not sitting there bored. It's a good way to waste a couple of hours in a film where no thinking is required."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good effects, good story line. Don't know why so much hate"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually very impressive, give it chance to develop, and be open to where it's going and you'll enjoy it. Don't fall into the trap of comparing it to others, if this was the first time you had watched this genre you'd be impressed, I can't wait to see part 2."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Nice space Ronin.  All lines were not delivered the best but the world building and the action was all there.  VFX were alright as well.  Just an enjoyable action flick.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Rebel moon 
Part one : A child of fire 
The best movie I watched this year."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Epic. 
''Steals from other classics'' - who doesn't want to see a mash up of the greats. It's beautiful."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,I had high hopes for this movie. But the very opening ruined it for me. Hobbits in space. Cliche.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning, highly imaginative, incredible action scenes, and yes, on overstuffed story that will hopefully come together once part two is released. Longer runtime and R rating would've helped this get to a 5 for me. I can assure you (like almost all of Zack's movies), the RT rating is not reflective of his movie - definitely check this movie out if you want to be entertained! I liked it better than Star Wars ep.7, 8, and 9 - by a wide margin!"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought the film was very good, I liked the story and I can't wait for part 2, it's a shame it's going to take a while to come out"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Shallow plot that failed to get me hooked.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed this film. It has a good story (I can see the Star Wars in the plot) I loved the FX and the acting was top notch. Great movie. Almost feels like Warhammer 40k.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excellent costume designs with loads of small details and the gear/clothes all have amazing and realistic weathering to them. The world building is slow but giving and Critics should just shut the frell up. Never have they been right the last decade or two. Listen to the audience instead. ;)

Amazing film, characters and character-building and a solid story you feel compelled to follow. Would class the movie as a solid future Sci-Fi classic.
As a prop-maker myself i am blown away by the sheer details that they have worked on that you quite never notice. I'd like to put this movie up with space operas like: Star wars, Farscape, Firefly and Star Gate. Great drama, amazing action and great CGI in the few cases it's used (yes, all spaceship and space is CGI), but they have also used a lot of real props/places which gives it a lovely gritty and realistic look and feel.

Definitely will watch again!"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Same old shtt. Was very excited for this release. Movies are getting more disappointing the ever
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ok. Too much slow-mo
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I really liked Rebel Moon. Okay. You can argue, that everything has already been done in other SciFi movies but Snyder‚Äòs esthetics make it feel fresh. The characters are introduced and you get the feeling, that this movie is just a prelude to bigger stories to come. I, for myself, I'm looking forward to part 2 and hopefully a lot more parts."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So disappointing, why did they not get a decent screenwriter, the story is disjointed and totally devoid of any connection with characters.  His worst film yet and I'm a fan"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It had Great Potential but Introduce 3 Characters that did nothing in Part one i speak of General Titus, Tarak, Nemesis and they just got along for the ride because of yeah we go against the Motherland and believe some random people they never saw. First i thought they where friends with Kai which is the best Character because hes reasoning makes sense, But there not so it makes even less sense why Tarak and Nemesis would help them for only so they could fight against the Motherland its such a whimsy reason. They should have shown less characters and give them more story and reasoning. They should have cut the backstory stuff from the main character shorter so they could actually build the other characters a bit more. I really tried to like it. i liked the Twist with Kai but all in all they just wanted to Much in Part One. They just could have let Kora and the Farmer go together searching they finding Kai and he knows Kora is worth much Money so he Betrays her immediately then does two can find away to Run away (maybe the young Soldier was with them and could have been killed in the escape so they lose someone that helped them from the beginning or even the Roboter he could have changed and helped them because at the start it looked like they will play a bigger role in the first Part if not why even introduce them in the first plays if they then will be forgotten for the whole Movie?) and may find General Titus the deserter and he tells them about the other two surviving special Soldiers from he's Special Squad named Taric and Nemesis so Titus would be the reason why the other to would want to help them and then they will find the Rebels in the second part maybe just don't rush it."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a intriguing new universe to explore. Character builds are fresh and exciting, so much to look forward too durring the second viewing. Something that the directors great at is the little details in not just the props and sets but the actors as well. Rebel Moon has got the whole package. It's hard to find characters worth unpacking but the contrasting characters in Rebel Moon are as pleasing as the high contrasting cinematography. Don't listen to the critics on this one, they are asleep."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Story 0/5
Acting 0/5
Special effects 2/5
Overall:  
This is Gobots trying to be Starwars 
The story is a straightforward copy of Battle for the planets without the charm. So derivative to a level I have never witnessed.
The acting is as good as the Willow TV show! 
The special effects were passable. 
I applaud the attempt to make a new sci-fi universe, but this an example of why directors should not try to write movies or shows.   It also proves that spending the most money doesn't guarantee good quality.
I personally just didn't enjoy this, I hope you do and if you do, that's great. 
For the record, 300 is one of my favourite films, because it was basically a direct translation of the amazing work of Frank Millar.  I enjoyed the JLSC.
But this was just a big miss for me."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"59-60%‚Ä¶,Its chopped and unfinished. It would of made a good Star Wars movie. But it's good to have an alternative. It's not perfect. It has its editing flaws, and comes off with a Rogue One/Rise of Skywalker/dune vibe. It borrows from some movies, but does good with those elements. If there is a extended version I'd like to see it. Part 2 is coming soon."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is amazing and for all the people saying it's how it copies form other movies well anyone that heard the interviews knew that he made it to be a Star Wars film but it was too mature so he went his own way with it but he made it to be heavily inspired by Star Wars because he is. Give Star Wars nerd . Every movie I see now borrow heavily from another so I'm not understanding why everyone is bothered‚Ä¶..wait that's wrong I do know why rotten tomatoes a company bought and paid for by Disney and a site that has been proven over and over again to be completely fake and fraudulent would have a problem and I know why the critics who on here who are bought and paid for by Disney + and Amazon would have a problem with it sand if you have half a brain and keep up with what's going on around you then you will understand as well. This is movies is ver good
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,A sorry ass excuse of a Star Wars ripoff.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Not sure why all the hate here. Definitely worth a watch.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was so excited to see what the end of all star wars was going to be...seeing that Star Wars is my all time favorite franchises. That being said, I can understand why George Lucas rejected this. I don't know what was worse, the gratuitous ""hero"" shots all over the movie, felt like Zach stroking his own ego at every corner, or the horrible dialog and acting. I can't blame the actors for that, I blame the director for giving them the wrong direction. The music was unnecessarily ""epic"" on every kinda hero shot moment. It was queue the hero music..she's going to sneeze...!! So, Star Wars franchise killer I think not...lol BTW this was my very first ever movie review. How did I do? ;P"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was hands down one of the worst movies i've ever seen. Not only was it derivative but it was borderline plagiarism of some of the most beloved Sci-Fi classics as well as some other beloved media such as the Magnificent Seven. The movie boasts good visuals, and thats where the positives end. It is pretentious, poorly written and even worse acted. Even it being in the Star Wars universe (as it was originally intended) would not have saved this slop from being a blatant creatively bankrupt laughingstock of the sci-fi fantasy ""space opera"" genre. Please for the love of god, if this movie interests you, go watch Dune part 1 instead, as it boasts similar visuals without the brain rot attached."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"First off, I'm going to start by saying when professional critics rate a movie bad, majority of the time I can almost guarantee I will like it. 
Critics seem to be paid for fake reviews. 
I myself enjoyed this movie as I do for the majority of Zack's content, this kept me intrigued and invested from start to finish, beautiful visuals and good character development. 

But most of all watch and make up your own mind"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A collection of pretty schlock. The film lacks any depth of character or the slightest homage to the hero's quest. There are better written video game stories, otherwise I would say it might work as video game. The two most sympathetic and interesting characters were left in the first act (a water girl and a droid - both would have made better protagonists than the shallow archetypes in the story). It could have been better with even an amateur writer at the helm. Story first, not spectacle. Disappointing."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Super film , certes il faut laisser au film le temps de mettre personnage et ambiance en place . 
Apr√®s cela on profite et moi j'ai ador√© les effets sp√©ciaux et sc√®ne d'action ou on prend le temps de sublim√© chaque plan ."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Rips everything from 40k to (obviously) Star Wars.  No original ideas anywhere to be seen. Also boring. Complete waste of a giant budget.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was a very good scifi action movie with a The Magnificent Seven vibe.  I really want to see the full edit now.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Irrelevant characters forming a team to fight for an irrelevant cause.
The story feels like a boring side quest in any RPG out there: (help these farmers to defend themselves against the evil).
Only the protagonist gets a little backstory. Everyone else just pops up on the screen and one cut later they are suddenly part of the squad.

Dialogues are bad. Over usage of slow mo. Most Charakters feel fake.

I don't even want to watch the 2nd part because it's so boring."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great film and awesome introduction to this exciting new world.  Some back stories would benefit from being fleshed out and likely will be in the director's cut.  Bring on Part 2!
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Mucha oscuridad, mucha c√°mara lenta que al final no termina de salvar la mediocridad de la narraci√≥n. Escenas que no llegan a nada, personajes que tiene vida m√°s no alma. Una historia para nada nueva o original que no promete convertirse en franquicia."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Serviceable Seven Samurai in space movie. Could be the foundation of a cinematic universe.
It is pretty transparent SAM is the Princess."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great story, amazing cast, and awesome cinematography."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Decent film - rushed middle part which I'm assuming will be sorted when the extended R version comes out. CGI looks better than anything by marvel and dc in past few years and done in a tighter budget - ZS really knows how to get the most bang for his money. Great movie for the dark winter nights - kids loved it.
Typical ROTTEN tomatoes score for a ZS movie! - Corrupt scoring system - good to see nothing has changed - RToms are on their way out- and it's about time."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"From as far back to Seven Samurai to A Bugs Life, its recycled story lines with shiny CGI and action choreography. Heres a recap, ""Im just a farmer, just kidding! We are gonna take on the Empire, you down? Ah you son of a b***, I'm in!"""
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,ME GUSTO MUCHO ... FALTA LA SEGUNDA PARTE PARA CONFIRMAR QUE ES UNA EXCELENTE PELICULA
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very bland, boring, predictive. Extremly stupid plot. Too many slow motion scenes. Good music and scenery."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing , it's fresh not trying what is currently going on with movies of this century but also futuristic"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was hooked from the first second from narration, cinematography, story and it keeps you glued to the screen throughout. The end gears you up and gets you anxious to start the sequel right away. A great sci fi film."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Almost insultingly predictable and completely uninventive. Honestly I only made it half way through and watched the rest the following day...reluctantly.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"La √∫ltima joya del cine de ciencia ficci√≥n ha llegado para cautivar a los amantes del g√©nero.

"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"cheap star wars, good only to pass a lonley night"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Well if you are looking for a story you are in for one big disappointment‚Ä¶dreadful, just dreadful plot‚Ä¶visually somewhat acceptable but again PG version just don't cut it that barn at the beginning should be dripping in blood for example"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I wanted to love this, but it was just boring. The story and the acting didn't pull me in. And the world didn't feel big enough, there was too much crammed into the run time. Dissapointed."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was a pretty good movie. Story could have been a little better, but it  had good action scenes and visuals."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not great. Leftover orc costumes? Plot holes, bad acting."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"bland and foreseeable mixture of better movies - great cgi and visuals in general, but no real storytelling except for exposition which feels out of place and generic at the same time"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning. Even though there's a lot of action, I think they could have trimmed a few minutes here and there.  Still, a good story with excellent special effects."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Despite initially beginning the movie in a state of half-sleep, I found myself instantly drawn into its world within the first five minutes. The film presents certain elements that echo familiar themes from other sci-fi classics, a nod perhaps to its unique developmental history. This aspect, far from being a drawback, adds to its charm. The journey was so immersive that I found myself feeling a tinge of sadness as it concluded. Anticipation is already building for the next instalment in this captivating series."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"A stunning sci-fi fest inspired by all the best, with interesting characters, massive world building and a streamlined plot."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Era lo que esperaba, ya la vi cuatro veces, muy buena"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is what Hollywood thinks we want? Jesus Christ, it's worst than the dune remake."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's all so flat and one note, despite a score and visuals that insist otherwise. Go watch ""Firefly,"" instead. PS. And the casting -- Charlie Hunnam... for fuck's sake."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Love the characters and amazing CGI work Rebel moon is epic can't wait for the next movie
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love it. Great story telling, great CGI."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, excellent casting‚Ä¶can't wait for the rest of the movies to come out"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Derivative, cruel, bad acting, tired storylines‚Ä¶ gratuitous‚Ä¶ had to turn it off ‚Ä¶ special effects do not a motion picture make. No Zack‚Ä¶ just no."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is fantastic!!!  Can't wait until part 2.  Visually stunning, excellent sound editing and decent storyline.  Great cast as well!!"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,This was the best movie I've seen in a while.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,So bad and so orange. A space movie where you go from mining town to farming town to cargo town. Its ugly and mainly out of focus and lense flair
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Possibly the worst movie iv ever endured. Don't know what was worst, the writing, the constant slow motion scenes or the acting all are absolutely shocking. We spent most of the movie laughing at how bad it was."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Rebel Moon part 1 is damned Amazing!!! Akira Kurosawa would be proud‚Ä¶. Hint. So first off I am old enough to have seen the first Star Wars Commercial trailer on a 1977 Panasonic TV.. and then see the movie 12 times in a row in Waikiki in 1977‚Ä¶ since then I spent 30 years in the Marines fighting 2 actual Wars‚Ä¶ been to every Con and still ticking‚Ä¶ the negative reviewers can go swallow a light saber‚Ä¶ Blind. 
The story line in Rebel Moon and the characters are all familiar going back to decades of other parables‚Ä¶. But the way R.M. weaves the narratives given the time and pacing available is new‚Ä¶and Freshly unfamiliar as the epic scenery and graphical style‚Ä¶ it frickin drips with molten awesomeness! The slow mo shoot outs are like Dead Eye from Red Dead‚Ä¶ but better the blasters and sabers are reinvented. The protagonist Kora 
(hello Tron and last Avatar) is a believable sleeper bad ass chic ala Vazquez in Aliens‚Ä¶ Gen Titus in a Gladiator stadium wanting to Die with Honor!!!???
Hell yes PTSD for a flag officer‚Ä¶ Maximus salutes you Sir‚Ä¶again. I could go on but why? Just watched with my 3 kids and hell‚Ä¶ gonna watch again tonight with sub woofers on Kill‚Ä¶ Thank You Zach Snyder‚Ä¶ Semper Fi MF."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Soooo let's start one they aren't space Nazis they are just Nazis in space. The CGI starts out great first world looks awesome. But in my opinion the visuals fade very quickly after leaving. The ssssssssssssssslllllllooooooooooowwwwwwwwwww mmmmmmmooooooooo is everywhere they are farming in slow mo. Slow mo doesn't make things more important or better. Now my second huge gripe is the constant fucking exposition dumps Jesus they are nearly constant 1-2 in every arc. You can show or tell ZS does both bold move but you can't do it 9 times. Now great plot idea to build a team but for me the team is too big smaller team would help us care more about the charters so when things happen we can really feel the outcomes. Also let's talk about the leading lady looks great but I have trouble really connecting to her she feels very forced and I think maybe the directors cut can bridge this gap but why release it. The visuals are great I suggest watching it in theaters or make it as cinematic as possible. Think felt more like a what you missed catch up to a tv series very episodic continuity was an issue for me. Which brings me to pacing which wasn't very good. Maybe the directors cut can save it and really make it resonate with me for now I want to give it a 5.7/10 for the fact it's a new IP for ZS I will say a 6.2/10
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I stopped the streaming at one third of the movie. I simply could not take more bad dialogues, obsessive compulsive slow motion, uneven digital effects, an unimaginative and derivative plot. This movie is just unwatchable."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie! Still world building and has few unexplained stuff,but they building something good here! Really looking forward to director's cut and part 2 ü§üüèªü§üüèª"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie is hugely entertaining, the story does more than enough to hold you, it is visually stunning, My only hope is that the second installment lives up to the first one. It is really amazing to see a new IP that can weave a great storie with amazing effects. Well done Zach."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Rebel Moon is so desperate to be epic that it constantly trips itself up by not giving you a reason to care. Monologues with drama club level dialogue are thrown around without giving you a single reason to care about the characters. It's a masterclass in the worst kind of story telling which is ""a thing happens, then another thing happens, then another thing happens"" and all the while I just don't care about any of it because I haven't been given a reason to. Some of the actions scenes are decent but slow-mo is overused. CGI is decent but uninspired. If you have anything else to watch give it a go before you watch this absolute clunker."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great don't believe the critics ! Can't wait for the second film!
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not good. Story is lacking, actor's are dull, way too many characters."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I loved this movie!! It has everything and more!! Great characters- storyline and scenery was incredible!!!
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I can truly say that there is so much potential with this film, it was entertaining to watch aside from a few moments where you could tell some scenes were cut. I do wish we already had the extended version available however overall it's a good start to a franchise."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Crazy Script. Bad Picture also.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very fun movie, unfortunately it has to do a bit of world building to differ from Star Wars. Other than that, it's a nice set up for further adventures."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wasn't sure what to make of this film at the start but after it finished I was looking forward to part 2. 
Reminds me of Dune/ Star Wars and I'm looking forward to character development and the rise of the droids."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A pretentious piece of garbage‚Äîtwo hours of boredom in slow motion. The dialogue and the plot diverge right at the beginning of the movie, and they do not converge again until the credits. The only thing that is marginally good is the photography (at times).

Will I watch the second part? Of course, but only to write an even more colorful review."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,I was looking forward to seeing this movie and the biggest disappointment is that I have to wait 3 months to see the end.  I'm surprised at the critics reviews but I believe it's because they have to see wait 3 months to see the ending as well.  Such a long wait is silly in my opinion and makes me uninterested in seeing how it ends.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this. I was grabbed straight away by the fantasy elements thrown into a sci fi world. As a fan of Zack Snyders normally, and a fan of sci fi, and fantasy, it just came together with a fantastic combination of things I enjoy. 

I understand some of the ""these characters needed more development"" criticism; a lot went on and some of them in particular, their motivations were unclear, things that I'm sure the longer cut later will clear up but issues none the less. It didn't hinder my enjoyment, just some I'd have liked to see more of. 

The world building was really great and seeing this play out as the first half of a larger story; giving a little context and purposefully leaving out some elements that are due to play forward next film was interesting.

While it could have served from developing some of the characters stronger, I loved the world we saw and am so excited to see it all expand"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is an unapologetic love letter to every sci fi movie, book, and idea that came before it.
It is spectacularly beautiful, incredibly fun, and absolutely worth checking out.
As a reference point I thought Sucker Punch was unwatchable it was so bad, but I loved Watchmen (even though they changed the ending) and 300. 
I believe (as I am 54 years old) the only Star Wars movies were episodes IV and V and Rogue One, and the only worthwhile series has been Andor.
If you're like minded you'll love Rebel Moon.
I don't get all the negativity.
Just enjoy it"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the worst movies ever made. You'd literally have breandead to enjoy it.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Yet another example of how 'critics' just simply don't matter. They are obsolete. The movie was a joy from start to finish. The heavy influence from things like Warhammer 40,000 only add to this love letter to science fiction. This is the last Jedi we should have had."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Entertaining and great visuals, simple plot....I enjoyed it."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Film, really enjoyed it and can't wait for part 2, film critics know nothing.."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow! Zack is nailing it! You get what expected, and alot more, aliens, beautiful violence, infinite universe with great possibilities üòç"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent sci-fi + hero movie!
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"For someone as myself who is very picky of what i like, I have to say, Rebel Moon was Very Good to me. I really really liked it. 
Yes the visuals were great but the storyline??!!?? I see where it's beginning and where it is going. Just a beginning of it all.
The Movie is GOOD Y'aLL and worth the watch and I believe that when the RATED-R come out{whenever the heck that would be) it will be even much better.üòâ"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,My only criticism is that you can tell a lot was held back to make the pg13. Should've just gone full on with the R rating.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"4 to combat the unfair critics rating. It is good, well made and better than expected due to critics"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,An excellent start to a franchise that has a ton of potential!
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I have never left a review on a movie but this ‚Ä¶ smdh battlefield earth vibes ‚Ä¶ and I won't even address the audio level issues.

 The music is loud and effects are loud. Dialogue is low because it's pretty pointless in listening to the acting or story. 

I had high hopes and they were shattered in the first 15 min. It sucks I watched the whole thing thinking it would get better ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"awful, blatant ripoff of so many better movies"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"PUT A CHICK IN IT! MAKE IT LAME. 
Same old, same old."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,An incoherent mess of a movie with horrible dialogue and character development.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The 1st 20 or so minutes I was picking apart all the self inflicted wounds and paint by numbers BS... but then my brain shut off and I started having fun. It's very Rogue one, Riddick, Oceans 11 and D&D (Honor...thieves) in a blender. ... If your Older it's New Hope, Excalibur, Krull, , Sword and the Sorcerer, and Gloria in a blender or something like that... you get the point."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is incredible. So glad it didn't get picked up by Disney. Critics were bagging on it before anyone got to see it. The fact that the audience score is so much higher now that it's been released for wider viewing proves that critics should be ignored. Great visuals, strong characters, underdog story; derivative, yes, but so is everything. Glad to have some world building without it being tied to another existing franchise. We need more of this rather than perpetual spinoffs to play on nostalgia."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Stunning visual and great action scenes.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Childish characterisation, derivative plot and self indulgent action and imagery."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Sucker Punch all over again. Weird, juvenile, weightless, unengaging, grotesque aesthetics and braindead world building. Somewhere between a dull trip to grandma's house, and a forced stay at a Juggalo convention."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Arguably the worst movie of recent years?
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring, rehashed tropes with no consideration for story."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It is god awful. I mean really bad. Incomprehensibly horrid. I can't find the correct words to describe the depth of putrid hideousness that fouls the air in which we breathe.  

What I've just watched is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever seen. At no point in its rambling, incoherent story was it even close to anything that could be considered a rational story line. Everyone who watched it is now dumber for having viewed it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,No wonder Lucas didn't want to do this awful Star Wars retread
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"A movie for fiction lovers.
Those who don't like fiction in its purest essence will say that they didn't like it, that they thought it was so-so, among other lame reasons. If you're reading this, don't draw conclusions from these poor people. The movie is excellent in every respect, with excellent special effects, an interesting story about an overwhelming and savage force over people incapable of defending themselves and which will have much more to come in part 2, excellent setting, among others. For lovers of star wars, star trek, lord of the rings and fans of themes involving authoritarianism, you'll give this movie a 10, for those who love fiction, you'll give it something close to that. The movie is excellent and I recommend you draw your own conclusions from it.

O filme √© excelente e recomendo tirar suas pr√≥prias conclus√µes do filme."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me gusto la pel√≠cula, visualmente una maravilla. Entretenida y diferente me ha faltado m√°s escenas de acci√≥n, esperemos la versi√≥n extendida."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"While I'll always be thankful for Watchmen, this just came off as pretentious. I don't think that there was a single scene where I didn't say, ""Oh, I've seen that before. But the original film did it better."" Whether it was Star Wars, Riddick, Seven Samurai, Magnificent Seven and even Battle Beyond the Stars.
Nothing to see here - Move along, move along..."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie is not convincing because it has issues with screenwriting and acting. Regarding screenwriting, the movie is flat without suspense. It is boring. And the actors do not have charisma. It is impossible to believe the characters they are bad actors. If we talk about clothing characters, they are cheap without creativity. To use good visual effects sometimes is not enough. This bad film looks like Solo and Rouge One. The producer should ask why the Star Wars series are better."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Excellent. Much better than recent Star Wars installments
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good watch, fantastic effects, only big minis from me is the story which starts awesome and after am hour going down to the.moment when I started to wonder: why the heck was thise 2hrs of movie I watched...? Still pretty good."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed it more than I expected given the beating it took from the critics 
Give it a try. Pretty good movie"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's not original. It's not Star Wars or any in its genre. Who really cares? Why do critics always feel the need to compare? In a predicament where it's reviewed solely on its own existence it's entertaining. None of these critics have a creative bone in their body other than pull others hard work to pieces. Enjoyable movie for me, no comparisons."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed Rebel Moon: Part One. It's visually stunning, the effects are great, and the fighting just as I like it. As many said, it's a variation of Seven Samurai story (Magnificent Seven, The Dirty Dozen‚Ä¶) in space and as a lifelong science fiction fan, this was right in my alley. I know it started as a Star Wars spinoff idea, but I felt it was more Farscape and Firefly on steroids. Just something I needed. Can't wait for Part Two."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Don't go by the critics, this is a entertaining movie and worth viewing."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,it creates endless possibilities for upcoming movies
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Rebel Moon (Firefly and Magnificent 7 mashup) was entertaining - but I think it was missing a Nathan Fillion :)
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was a mash of all space opera movies.  Plus add in some Harry Porter, Tomb Raider, and 300."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This visually stunning sci-fi epic is amazing! Better than most of what Hollywoods 200 mil + movies had offered us lately. It's so impressive how wrong the critics were. A movie for you and your girl/partner will enjoy on a Friday night with food! It automatically hooks you in to the story the bad guys were great antagonist! The main character Kora was bad ass in such a believable way no Mary sue who isn't afraid of being sexy and powerful. But this movie will leave you wanting MORE! your gonna want more character backgrounds, more worlds to visit,  more aliens to see, more fights and when the 3hr DIRECTORS CUT comes out we will have more! I cannot withhold my anticipation for part 2 in April. A great watch!"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,If you're a fan of Zack movies you're be in for a treat.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring with no storyline and no strong characters. Mainstream entertainment is fading off, and if we're lucky we'll have just one awesome scifi movie once a year, RIP."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Una pel√≠cula r√°pida divertida con mucha acci√≥n, una gran pel√≠cula, lo que se espera de este tipo de pel√≠cula, y te deja un buen sabor de boca se hace corta"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,es un completo desastre en todos los aspectos. es una larga introducci√≥n de personajes planos al rededor de las 2 horas de su duraci√≥n.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"An amazing creation of different realms all meshing into a single movie - wow. If you're a sucker for sci-fi, action packed films - prepare to be sucked into this one & on the edge of your seat for the next to release. Will be great to see more character building but overall was quite the experience! Well done."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good movie,not the best of the world but a very good one,I liked the Reference even if sometime it feel like a geek fever  dream, it has good action and a little twist in the end,  i also think the critic is  a bit harsh,it's no dune but it's not battefield earth 
see you for the 2nd part"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,No way this should be rated so negative. One of the best movies I've seen in awhile!
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not memorable, a bit boring, got to the end‚Ä¶ just."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it. It was an awesome ride.! I can't wait for Pt2! Don't listen to the critics
..the movie is a breath of fresh air.!"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie story was also amazing
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Nice! Waiting for Part two!
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I really don't understand how this goes through an multiple takes, editing, review process and no goes hey. This battle destroyer that is in combat, flies through space dealing with micro meteors has glass that a spear can get through. Like what... 

Or that hey the Kings is dead, but later show they can re-incarnate with memories. The trop of people dyeing and then coming back two seconds later it getting really old.

They make a big deal about getting General Titus, and how scary it will be but was 30 seconds of dialog and then like ok I will come with you. They focus more on that gryphon rifder then the General who they were foreshadowing would be a hard sell. If you going to have your characters talk about how scary he is maybe he should be the main focus of the side characters you are picking up.

Story dull, Zack synder 300 action style getting old. I really think he needs better writers around him and editors that can rain him in. Overall this was a dud for me. I don'te ven care about part 2"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If you are doing something else, this will cover 2 hours and 15 minutes... As a movie to sit and watch, don't. It was like a fever dream of disparate tropes. It was as though the writers peeled apart Star Wars, Foundation series, Chronicles of Riddick, Anime, and half a dozen other sci-fi/fantasy titles and put it in front of great imagery. I felt nothing for the characters throughout despite liking some of the actors based on other work and the story lacked depth. The flashbacks helped with the story building, but they were inserted poorly overall. This could have been better but it would have started with the writing."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"For what is was it was really good. You can see where the context of scenes are left out because it is the PG-13 version. Extremely anticipating R-rated 3 hour movie! I can tell already from this viewing it's going to be INSANE! I got what i needed out of it, but didn't get what i wanted.. Admiral Noble is BRUTAL and Kai was fantastic! Those two were my favs! Kora and Jimmy where solid.. I really wanted more from Nemesis but i should get that from R-rated version. ALL & ALL solid movie don't believe these haters. Family had a really fun time watching."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved the movie just missing character development to be perfecto
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It‚Äôs like Star Wars from the dollar store, or you could say even Temu. But it‚Äôs fun and great to see if you like overcomplicated storytelling of sci-fi movies. ü§î"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,A terrible and clumsy mess that took effort to keep watching. Almost every aspect of the film after the first 15 minutes was rough.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"300 meets Rogue One without the charm or passion.

I made it to ACT 2. Couldn't get past that.

Feels clunky, lazy and uninspired.

ACT I had incredible potential, then completely fell flat.

Also, female protagonist had no weakness,  stopped caring after awhile

Visually cool.

I wanted to love it."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The movie is not as bad as i thought it would be, i was able to just turn my brain off and enjoy the action, knowing there is a part 2 and director's cut i guess i can't be too critical of this part 1 because its clear the story is not complete but i think they could have just cut it in to 30 to 40 minute episodes and made it a mini series."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"For me movie was awesome,   story was good, explained all very well, every one had their time im story , action scena are very good. Cant w8 for second part. It was na intruduction into universe of rebel moon"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"From the press I had seen I was really excited to watch this . A dark Star Wars , Andor extra was the impression I had .
It was awful , I was embarrassed I had recommended it to my family , the first left after about 20 minutes .
It's drivel.
Magnificent 7 with absolutely no character establishment , obscene over use over slow mo for fight scenes, everything was pedestrian and predictable . By the end we were as a family predicting every next move of the ( and I use the term lightly ) plot. 
Nearly everything was stolen from other films , and then done badly . Magnificent 7, lord of the rings , Star Wars , terminator, chappy , the list goes on and on .
Even a wish Arthur Shelby to boot !! 
Black Adam had a better written and more believable script and with deeper characters too . 
 I suspect part 2 is already past the point of no return but there is absolutely no chance there is going to be a part 3. 
Directors cut ? Yeah he should be , from all future productions ."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is good. Don't believe the critics. Watch it and decide for yourself.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Reminded me of all 80's anime and B movie scifi. Which I love!
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Oh Rebel Moon... I don't know. Mixed feelings. Great film but... The story was meh, it needed more. And Zack please stop over using the blurring effect. Otherwise can't wait for Part 2."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics don‚Äôt even know what they‚Äôre looking for in a action/sci-fi. The movie was fun and original 
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic music, magnificent visuals, great action. Empire is a real menace. Cannot wait for the second part."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I went into this, hopeful for an epic Sci-Fi experience. The character development was shallow and was overridden by the action sequences. It lacked depth for a world built with huge potential. I can't even say that archetypes were used successfully."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Can confirm, the Rebel Moon IS made of cheese.  I wanted to like it, just like the film WANTED to have gravitas... we both failed.  It doesn't borrow other film tropes, it press gangs all of them unwillingly into service.  The end result is a mish-mash of underwhelming moments."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Omg what a Brillent massive film by Zachary zyndra hurry up 4part w2in April carnt wail to long lol ‚Ä¶carnt wait to see part 2 2hr film was amazing film enjoy it
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"A couple of cheesy scenes, but there is non-stop action, plenty to draw you in emotionally, and oh such much bad-assness. Leaves you wanting to know the tragic, yet beautiful, backstory of EVERY character."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,I had high hopes but they fell flat with this movie. Visually stunning at times but that's about it.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Fun movie with great characters and set in an interesting universe.  Don't understand the negative reviews.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Parem de frecura o filme √© bom divertido!
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the most boring and useless movie ever made.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Half the movie was in slowmotion, lots of big explosions and ""cool"" characters. Good way to waste a couple of hours."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awsome film, I absolutely love it , can't wait for part 2!"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Does it have the best writing? No. Is it watchable and entertaining? Yes.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Firstly, I thought the film had great effects, a great cast... something I hadn't seen in this type of film in a long time (fiction film)... and I would like to say that the film managed to express itself successfully"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I admittedly only got through 3/4 of the movie an fell asleep.  I was surprised that the visuals in this weren't better considering that's what the director is known for.  It is really slow, I mean really slow (maybe the slow motion made that more apparent)  With Star Wars being iffy with their movies lately, I thought there might be a window for this, but even at their worst they are much better.  It feels like the $1 store knock off.  Some directors need someone reeling them in a bit, this is a prime example."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visuals, audio, actoring are really good. Plot is one of the worst clusterfucks of bad writting I have ever experienced. Don't be fooled by okayish intro. It only gets worse"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Due to the audacious marketing that this was the NEXT Star Wars, It was automatically held up on a high pedestal. That's something that you need to allow your audience to proclaim, not your lackey marketing goblins. It took me awhile to separate myself from that and just look at it as it was. 

It was fine. It was certainly visual and it had some genre panache. At times, it felt like they threw every successful scifi franchise in an AI blender and said cook. The characters were interesting enough. I just hardly know much about any of them outside of Kora. There wasn't much character development. Sure, each of this Sci- fi fellowship can handle their own but that's not who they are to their core. When big things start happening in the story, I just shrugged. They are still strangers to me and the danger is very low stakes. All very frustrating as we have the capacity for deep story telling with the glimmer of mythology from the Princess Issa story. That's basically as deep as it gets. 

The third act definitely felt rushed and very sudden. Not in a fun a-ha, gotcha, way. Kinda like they were assessing that they needed to end and decided to end. By doing so, they put in a beat where they killed the weight of some of the important setup by the narrator at the beginning. Jist cast it aside with no consequences. Overall making the payoff a bit hollow. 

Here's hoping Pt. 2 paves the way more thoughtfully. 

All a shame."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was pitched as a star wars film and you can see that literally taking many things from it with little difference including scenes.

The characters are very one dimensional with little reason to like any of them and there are far too many, for what is a 2 part film duo I struggle to think part 2 will get you invested in any of them 

Each character is quickly glossed over and makes it feel like how the star wars sequel trilogy felt in terms of character development, non existent. Any background of the main character of which I do not even know her name is told in the form of her talking over a flashback instead of showing these events really unfold.

Slow motion is beyond egregious, sure it looks pretty but it's over used so much it makes the scenes where it's used well less impactful because I'm seeing it constantly.

It is just another mediocre film that feels like a really bad star wars rip off sadly

The villain guy is slightly compelling and I'm more interested in his story tbh

I don't think a part 2 will save the shallowness of this film."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I could not get into It visually was stunning, but the storyline just lacked. holes in the plot and not enough background on the 
characters... very ·∏çisapointed"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Friggin awesome. If you like badass fight and action scenes in a much darker more grim Star Wars world then you'll love this movie. Do not let the rotten tomatoes review stop you from watching this movie. Baffles me a movie this entertaining can get such a bad review here. Very cool to see another interpretation of the Star Wars world not through the eyes of Disney.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The world building was stellar and so was the visuals as well, although some of the acting and writing was subpar most of it worked fluidly I do recommend."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a promising universe. We want to see more and continue on this world. The film is a classic Snider movie with characters that play really well and, of course, beautiful Snider-style visuals."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Awful film, slow motion scenes every 30 seconds some shocking acting had to turn it off before Charlie hunnam came into the movie because I'd hate to see such a good actor be apart of that shambles truly awful film and directing, story was slow and boring."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Why such bad reviews? This was fun
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,I enjoyed it. It did feel like two films were compressed into one 2 hour film unfortunately. Looking forward to the second film.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed it. Like what they did with the Han Solo character. Looking forward to the extended cut as more character development definitely needed.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Rebel Moon Part One was a bit of a letdown for me. I had heard that this was originally a pitch for a Star Wars movie, but I went in with certain expectations. I was imagining a slightly grittier version of Star Wars, and instead, it was a mashup of stereotypical Sci-Fi tropes and far too much slow-motion action. 

The theming of the movie was all over the place as well. It appeared that they were trying to go with a sort of Roman-inspired theming for the main antagonists, however, it was done in a way that felt very much like several other large Sci-Fi franchises. There were also themes of Westerns and samurai/ninja theming in there as well and they didn't find a way to blend them successfully in my opinion. On the same planet, there was also a village that was of a northern European style akin to Viking culture, and they rode their animals a day ride to a town and it was essentially a futuristic mashup of a Wild West town. No two places seemed to be connected in this universe with everything having such vastly different design languages.

Aside from the failed theming of the film, I had some serious issues with pacing as well. When the protagonists were traveling, there was no time between their previous encounters and the new. They would be on the ground about to leave and then immediately in another area about to meet with the person they were looking for. There was no buildup in meeting any of the individuals they were looking for, and there was no real reason that they were making any of the stops in the first place. It wasn't revealed until nearly the end of the film why they had been picking up particular individuals, and the 'twist' in the story was seen for a long time coming. Again with the timing being so odd, nearly all of the action in this is of the Slow-Motion variety. While I don't have anything against that in itself, when you watch the same people moving very slowly for about 5 minutes in what could have been a 30-second encounter, you start to get a bit bored.

I also have some issues with the story itself, however I won't spoil that here. I'll just say that the only characters that I was truly invested in either died after being on screen for a few minutes or had a very minor role in the film. I wasn't able to find a good connection to any of the main cast as all of their characters were truly unlikable except for the farmer. Every other main character had some element to them that made them feel as though they could be disposable and that I wouldn't mind if they died in the film.

The story of Rebel Moon was a bit too much thrown in your face. The audience wasn't allowed to 'see' the story unfold as there was far too much of the story that was 'told'. A common theme in great films is to make the story 'seen, not told.' Rebel Moon failed miserably at that. 

One area that this film shines through is its effects. I thought that they looked quite good. There is a robot character that shows up quite early in the film, and it looks fantastic. It's not all good though, as many of the aliens in the film look like they took a person and altered them slightly. None of them apart from one in my opinion look rather good. They seem to be just costumed people with rubber faces. There were no unique alien ideas, again aside from one that used another person to talk for them.

Overall, if you are interested in cheesy Sci-Fi and don't mind a half-baked story then go ahead and watch this. If however you don't like the over-troped Sci-Fi and slow-motion messes, stay away it's not for you."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Generally I was Entertained and plan to watch Part 2 but there some parts that did not feel right. For example some dialogues felt a bit weird also it might would have helped starting this first part with a smaller main cast to flesh out characters a bit more.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I wasn't too sure if I wanted to take a chance on this film...luckily I trust myself and decided to judge it by myself. The story was not what I expected..it was much better. The characters were all fantastic. The acting was really well done. The message of the story was truly inspiring. Judge the movie yourself. I am sooo looking forward to part 2 and see what happens to these amazing people. THANK YOU for entertaining me for the second or this time this entire year.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Bro just copied star wars and thought we wouldn't notice. Cancel part 2 pls
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A bunch of stock characters gather to defeat bunch of cardboard cuts outs in order to protect a village. I've seen this movie before and I liked it better when it was called the Seven Samurai, The Magnificent Seven or Bug's Life. If there were less slow motion we might be able to squeeze in some character development, but I guess we get to wait until the three + hour director's cut is released to get any of that."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"this movie was fun, well paced and much more dynamic than any of the recent marvel & Star Wars shows/movies"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie. loved the cinematic scenes. CGI was awesome apart from some scene where it felt it could be better. the character building of main character girl Kora is amazing. loved it. but other characters where short on their build up. about the team they all teamed up so quickly, i thought it would take a bit more convincing to recruit them. and their aims are so bad .they are top notch fighters arnt they. 
overall, these are just some things which i dont say are bad but could have been better to have. loved this movie, hyped to the build up. This universe is going to be epic.
Highly Recommended!"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,The most expensive high school production I've ever seen
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Un Star Wars de p√©sima calidad!
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's an amazing movie, a great beginning for this new universe"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie, some really great action scenes and you can tell he took inspiration from Star Wars, Warhammer 40k and maybe even Star Trek. But i can't wait for part 2"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Cant wait for part 2
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bland, pointless, benign, boring, forgettable. All words that explain this movie. I respect the attempt but it ended with a jumbled mess of one liners and attempts at creating a deeper plot but missing completely. Nothing about this was unique. Multiple actors that I really enjoy and I am sad that they weren't brought to their full potential with this syfy leftover mess."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Everything about the movie is paper thin, and it is so self-serious that it's hard to take seriously. With the non-stop slow motion and choral chanting, it wants so badly to be epic but doesn't lay the groundwork needed to feel like any of it is deserved."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It was what I expected
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"An action-packed, lore-rich sci-fi universe that seems both believable and real. The action scenes are highly detailed and entertaining. The lore given and the mystery of the lore untold will leave fan theory crafters and lore-obsessed fans with a load of content to unravel. If Star Wars met Warhammer 40k, it would be Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wow this movie is absolute trash, I want my time back"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Slowly building up the lore with as much detail as possible, amazing CGI, Gigantic Universe, Unpredictable, and end the part one with a unique, dark, and insanely epic battle. Oh man, I found some ways of killing very creative. Thanks Zack for this one, it is truly unique, I keep screaming alone in my living room, amazing man, amazing."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Well done movie. Good action, great characters, great writing. Loved it can't wait till part 2! Better than the last 6 star wars movies!"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Honestly, I tried to come into this movie with excitement and was quickly let down. I don't get how various other reviews call this movie ""epic"" of all things cause while the movie looks pretty gorgeous, the writing and acting are absolutely atrocious. While there are a lot of elements borrowed from other sci fi films, rebel moon falls flat on its face with confusing writing and to be frank it failed to keep my attention just 35-45 minutes in. The main character is poorly written as well. I might try to give this movie another chance in the near future but for now this just ain't it."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Movie is solid for story and character building of a saga. Not the most creative movie but it is very well made. The cast is interesting with some bright spots and some actors clearly picked based on what they look like and not how they can portray a character(mostly the oiled up weird one).
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Filme muito bom n√£o vi nada que atrapalha para uma segunda parte um filme que faz vc roe as unhas gostei bastante desse filme. Parab√©ns para o diretor e os roteiristas
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,This is what Zak Schnider dows best
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Esta pelicula es justo lo que esperaba, es un espect√°culo visual, tiene mucha acci√≥n y cada minuto estas esperando ver mas y mas, el principio siento que es algo apresurado pero esto no es malo, prefiero eso a que dure una hora de introducci√≥n como otras peliculas, Zack no me fallo aqu√≠!"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is your basic rehashing of the Kurosawa movie ""seven Samurai"", but they replaced the character development with a  half explained universe of intergalactic conquest, slow motion shots straight out of 300, and fairly good use of CG that plays off of Star Wars archetypes. 

I give the actors a a lot of credit for doing so well considering the actors didn't get any help from the AI constructed drivel that they called a script. The acting and eye candy visuals are the sole reason to watch this movie."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Solid characters and story.   Enough of a back story to lay the ground work to be engaged but definitely wanting more.  Good start to the franchise.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The film is exceptional.  Everything is there: the scenario, the soundtrack, the actors, the sound and the image, despite some slightly botched inlays.  I advise you to see it, and can't wait for the sequel."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was MEH!!!! Didn't hate it but didn't love it. No real action. The only real action was hero shots where the frame the heroine doing something but no real substance or lead up to the action. Movie was so predictable. Story felt like a watered down version of magnificent seven. I love all the actors and actresses but they can only do so much with bad direction and a shitty script.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Critics suck at judging movies this was a damn good one actually anticipating the second yet it is so bittersweet because you can see if Zack actually got star wars(even then it's truly now overrated the story isn't great and it's never been good other than visually being real about it) it would have been badass and great storytelling is great but I can say it's hard to watch without thinking damn we could have gotten a decent star wars trilogy outta this guy.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is great, the story is good, visuals are fines. Yes it looks like something we've seen before but does not ? I found here everything i loved from all the movies i liked before. Watch it without thinking about press critics."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So lame. Visually striking at times but it's obvious the creator just took his favorite scenes from Star Wars, LotR and some action movies and smashed them together. Tons of poor attempts at deep dramatic moments all smashed together make the movie feel shallow and weak. You can't take every deep moment from ypur favorite movies and string them all together one after the other and expect it to land as if it had a whole movies worth if buildup. Don't waste your time watching this, literally write your own star wars fan fic and it will be more entertaining."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I had so much fun, great cast and character design, great action. And beware of the - King‚Äôs Gaze! Surprisingly, it was more emotional than I expected. "
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"C'est un tr√®s bon film de science-fiction et un bon divertissement ! Fort heureusement que je ne tiens plus compte des pseudos chroniqueurs de cin√©ma, j'aurai rat√© un bon film ! Je vous le conseille !"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,The only redeeming quality of this movie is the stunning visual effects. Everything else's is trash.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Hitch-hikers Guide to the Galaxy mixed with Total Recall (the Arnie version) vibes. Would've been an awesome 90's movie. They really needed to make ol mate put a shirt on too, I am pretty sure its cold in space. Didn't connect with any of the characters, as they didn't give us a chance or a reason to. Wanted to see more of the robot though but he literally just runs off right when it got interesting for 30 seconds. Story is muddled and is just the same old David vs Goliath trope that has been done to death especially in these space ""opera's"". Putting some lack luster actions scenes in slow mo didnt make them cool. That worked great in 300, but this was meant to be an epic space battle and it really wasnt. It needed so much more. All hype and zero substance. If it was a Star Wars saga you'd buy in for the nostalgia and familiarity but, on its own, offers little to nothing to make you want to go back for more. If your short on time just watch the previews, you get the entire story and the best bits of the action, literally. I'll still watch part 2, probably, for some closure and hope of redemption. However, it doesnt even end with a cliffhanger or hook to entice you back. Bitterly dissapointed because I wanted it to be as good as the promo team made it out to be."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If you want to see a better movie, just watch magnificent seven or battle beyond the stars because there's not in the original idea in this movie. And all the battle scenes are in slow motion which result in terrible action sequences"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I expected ""average"" for this movie since action flick stories have been generic and recycled a lot. While Rebel Moon isn't unique at all in terms of story-telling. It delivered a lot of curious moments and particularly great twists at the end.

Being invested on the characters of this band of misfits, I was totally surprised to find and learned some exciting little details on the backstory of every member of the group that the female main protagonist had gathered.

It seems, this movie is cooking up some appetizing world-building adventure in the future and I feel its promise. I want more. 

As for this first part, I love it. It has some flaws, but for the sake of story-telling and all its gripping moments, it was well worth my time and interest.

Looking forward to the second part."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning. Not to mention entertaining as hell. Sci Fi tropes aren't bad if used correctly. Critics seemed to have missed this point, either on purpose or by lack of competence."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Me qued√© dormido , as√≠ de buena esta"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Really good science fiction movie!
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is an absolute epic. The characters, visuals, action everything is just EPIC!"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Great Visuals, couple forgettable characters, unfortunately not to memorable. Hopeful the director's cut/ part 2 is better"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie had awesome visuals and cinematography. I think the purpose of this movie was to set up the universe and it did it well. However, it missed many opportunities to develop some cool characters. It was set in space, it had action, it had a nice vibe. I'm all in."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie to watch.  Wonderful cinematography, kinda a mix of Warhammer and Star Wars. Good plot with a few nice twists.  For me, this is an easy 5, just an entertaining, exciting, visually ""eye candy"" sci-fi story. Fun stuff.  I was entertained!

Note: If you don't like sci-fi/adventure type movies or lean too hard into this movie, you will end up agreeing with the Critics Score."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic. Worth the watch. Can't wait for Pt 2.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,A very interesting approach at merging multiple sci-fi movies into one. However the transitions are very awkward and gives off a very sky pirate vibe. I would have appreciated less of those slow motion takes that happen every 5 minutes in the movie. Could have helped save that time and used it towards delivering a more fulfilling ending vs. a rushed one.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I would say it's a shot-by-shot rip-off of Star Wars, but it's missing any of the heart or humanity of Star Wars. Just exposition and battle scenes."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely terrible. I waited for this movie because I thought the trailers and special effects looked great but it turned out to be just complete trash. The story is boring and so simple it could have been written by a child, the acting is cringey and breaking it into 2 parts makes it even worse because it makes no sense. What a disappointment, I still cant believe it has such a high fan review. Please make better SCIFI in the future because this movie kills the SCIFI industry. ITS NOT THE INDUSTRY ITS JUST THIS MOVIE THAT SUCKS MAKE MORE SCIFI!!"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visually not awful... but that is probably one of the only reasons why I pushed through and finished this movie. This movie was bad, they tried so hard to be iconic... but nothing about this movie was iconic. Acting was meh, dialog was meh, story was extra meh! I hope they decide not to make the other 2 after this..."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Rebel Moon"" dazzles with its striking visuals, offering a feast for the eyes that elevates the entire cinematic experience. The film's storyline, while rooted in a promising concept, unfortunately treads a path too familiar, leading to a sense of predictability that slightly diminishes its overall impact. Despite this, the movie's strong visual elements and engaging premise make it a worthwhile watch for fans of the genre."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bad script, B tier acting and retelling the Seven Samurai in Star Wars universe with Warhammer 40k costume."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Okay, it's a cyber-punk, visually exhausting version of Star Wars in which Avatar Korra has to defend a farming village, and to do so she gathers together a gang made up of charmless Han Solo, hippogriff-taming Native American Anakin Skywaler, the emo version of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Shazan's wizard. Anyone else? Oh yes, Xander Harris from Buffy. But anyway, you can pass the time."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I made an account just to say that am in minute 61 and it is bad, it is really, really bad."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bad rehash of ""The Magnificent 7"" but worse than ""Battle Beyond The Stars."" Half the lines I have heard in other movies. The plot is so predictable you can guess who killed  the king  before 1/2 the movie is over. and I am sure they will not ""reveal"" that till   half way  through part 2."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly a lot like the first star wars movies, but with a better story an graphics ,  can't wait for part 2,  the movie start to finish is a lot of fun, action packed an they build the characters very well,  I think a lot of their back story's will come out in part 2,  but what you get on them in part 1 is enough to like an keep the pace going !"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Watched it the family and it is good! I don't really know why it gets a lot of hate, but me and my family enjoyed it! Can't wait to see part 2!"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Movie! Adventure. Awesome World Building! Innovative Science-Fi! Wonderful Visuals! A story seen many times, but uniquely adapted to this World! Had Grit to it, you could almost feel the power of the weapons used! I had heard the negative reviews-Don‚Äôt believe them! If you don‚Äôt like Fantastical stories or Zack Snyder‚Äôs way of directing, then this isn‚Äôt for you! It‚Äôs uniquely inspiring! Honestly ready for part 2 now!! My Highest Praise!"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great, the special effects are on point, also, the story is interesting."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It is a great movie. Story is great and so are the effects. I do wish though that we had the directors cut instead of the shorter theater cut so we have more of the story
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The visuals were good, but not amazing, and that for me was the only good thing about this movie. The plot is stale, the pacing terrible, the caracther work abysmal, the few plotwist badly managed or easily predictable. Leaves you with lots of loose ends that can't be justified just by the movie being a part 1. Would not recommend"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visually it is great, however that doesn't save it from the poor dialogue and script. Great actors for the most part, but the dialogue felt clunky throughout. Borrows from various different sci-fi genres but ultimately does not seem to be able to establish its own identify or make me care about any of the characters or the overall world setting.
Predicatble and"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Decepci√≥n es quiz√°s la palabra que m√°s lo define. Te hace pasar el rato, pero no es la epopeya espacial que todos esper√°bamos."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This Ridiculous fan fiction based on Star Wars. Is a complete waste of time and ridiculous fantasy of Zach Schneider.There is no coherent plot.  And we don't follow any specific character for any length of time. And he just interjects a bunch of characters and droids and beings from other franchises such as droid's orcs, and even buckbeak from harry potter. I cannot tell if this is supposed to be serious. It is the worst thing I have ever had to watch and I can't believe I made it through to the end. Nothing about this is original interesting. Good and dit is just copyright infringement and mimicry in the most poor form. I have ever seen in my entire f****** life."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Basically a sci fi version of Seven Samurai and The Magnificent Seven. I know this is part one of two but I feel Rebel Moon would've worked much better as a series rather than a two part movie. A Child of Fire felt so rushed IMO. Characters weren't fleshed out enough and there was way too much exposition that I felt would've worked better in a series. But that's just me. The visuals are fun to watch but honestly that's about it. I'll be curious how I feel after I watch The Scargiver.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie felt like it missed huge plot developments,  it felt rushed at the wrong point.  Visually well done.  Editing felt like they made it so they could release a director cut next year."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Cringe characters.  Opening scene with Saturn like planet ""painted"" onto a backdrop.  Not sure if even the visuals were up to par on this one.  It felt low budget - but probably cost a fortune to make."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The first 15 minutes are fine. The rest of the movie never really earns the scenes it tries to pull off. Too much happens too fast, and the pacing quickly becomes a disjointed rush, and it puts a lot on the viewers to bridge the gaps. All things considered, this probably should have been a 4 parter. It's enough to want what the vision for the film was, and despite its short comings I am still looking forward to part 2."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This website is terrible. People need to stop using it as a source to see if something is good or not.

This film on the other hand is rather bloody good. I honestly don't really have many complaints, only the main one is that it shied away from the blood too much. It's a 15, why did it do this?"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Its a decent movie. Incredible world building. I can't wait for the second part. Horribly underrated by critics.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This move is excellent! Too bad that ""This was supposed to be part of Star Wars"" narrative is out there since does only damage by Star Wars fans. Visuals here are epic. Even better than any of the recent Star Wars movies. Editing could have been done better, but as far as I understand this cut is missing huge chunk of the movie. It must be accounted for that when watching it. Can't wait for director's cut!"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great fkn movie!! Great story line!! Visually stunning!!
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Beautiful and stunning imagery as usual! It's an introduction story so I wasn't expecting them to just dive right in but the way it was told was brilliant. Each character their own arc I really enjoyed. Will rewatch many times.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I have been watching & reading sci-fi for 60 years. I really like space operas. I thought this movie was fun with a good story!
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If you're here to watch an original, new franchise set in space then don't bother watching. The vast majority of this movie's world-building is almost one-to-one plagiarism of Dune"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"As always with Zack Snyder's films, Rebel Moon is visually stunning with great action-packed scenes and music. 

The only negative thing I could find with the film was the 2nd Act. You can definitely tell there was many scenes cut from it. There will be a director cut later on that I'm sure will fix this problem. Cutting these scenes made seem like what was a great story to a straightforward story."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it, but I usually love most sci-fi shows/movies. I'm looking forward to part 2... and the directors cut (TBA)!"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Solid performances, interesting and adequately told story, good special effects, perfectly crafted action scenes, everything I look for in a science fiction film."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"waste of time, dull, predictable."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Well, add ""Rebel Moon"" to the LONG list of disappointing movies of the 2020's.
I have no idea why it wasn't billed as what it is. It is 100% ""Battle Beyond the Stars""... or ""7 samurai in space"". 
It suffers from TME ( Too much exposition), while at the same time snipping interesting stories immediately. 
The costume design ranges from amazing, to as bad as ""Farscape"" and despite the wonderful cast, manages to delivery lame ass dialogue."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Looked great. Actings good enough. Story is okay. The movie was so very dull. Just one big intro for the second movie I'd guess which is a shame because I won't tune in for it
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great set up for what's to come. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie! I can't wait for part 2!
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Entertaining but for as long as it was it felt rushed to me. Very little character development aside from the main protagonist.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Artistic, Engaging and entertaining. I like the concept for the world they are building and it is a solid foundation.

I think the critics lately are so wrong in so many movies, I go by audience rating more often because they are more accurate.

I can't wait to see the full cut!!"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Whew this was pretty bad‚Ä¶super cheezy and boring‚Ä¶
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was clunky and it felt like scenes were missing which i hope the rated r version fixes that but the movie is visually gorgeous. Every scene was shot beautifully and you can see how much care was put into it.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,So terrible in so many ways.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Zack had me from the opening credits! Yes, finally, a proper science fiction movie. It's been so long. Let me say this, visually this film was amazing. But it's as if Zack made Gumbo from several films of the past but he never learned how to make a roux. There is not enough flavor to this film. Not enough soul. It's very hard to stay interested. It took me four times to be able to finish the film. Visually a delight, but overall another disappointment."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Es mal√≠sima, sin excusas, este director no sabe c√≥mo construir una historia s√≥lida, nunca supo. Necesita 8 horas m√°s para contar lo que quiere y aun as√≠ lo har√° mal. Todos sabemos que esta pel√≠cula es un quiero y no puedo de otra franquicia que la rechaz√≥, y menos mal."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I know it may not be much, but hear me out. REBEL MOON: A CHILD OF FIRE is wild, ambitious, and entertaining, giving everyone an action packed first chapter to an even bigger story."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Rebel moon is a blend of Warhammer 40k imperials and the Magnificent seven (the Chris Pratt one). The design is great, and so are the visuals. The story and motivations though, is a mess. After 2 hours and 14 minutes, nothing has been accomplished and we are pretty much back where the movie started. 

If you want to enjoy this, try not to think to hard about anything. Otherwise you will probably turn it off after less than 20 minutes. 

Still hoping the second part can save this world, but my hopes are low."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's kinda Pocahontas with Star Wars, and with a nice cinematography, I recommend to watch"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Definitely can feel the influences of other scifi greats. However, unique and entertaining, would enjoy the uncut version if released. Looking forward to more films in this ip."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved the movie. Given what the budget they had, and what was turned out is amazing. I don't understand why critics are being so harsh on the movie. Can't wait to see the next movie."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,So bad it almost seems intentional.  80 lb young girl destroys a dozen soldiers in a barn in slow motion. Luckily even though the soldiers all have guns the patiently wait to attack one at a time.  No story no emotion but everything looks Orange
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's really not that bad of a movie as the critics make it out to be.  DON'T listen to the critics.  It's a pretty good set up for the next movie, looking forward to the conclusion."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Best movie... Absolutely a must watch
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was going tog give it a 4 - but then i saw that all critics hates it bc its not PC enough for them. So now im going to give it a 5. Fking hate PC critics.

Edit: This is actually a great movie. And the ppl giving it 1/5 cant possibly seen the same movie. 
But something sticks out, a lot of the 1 star reviews are from ppl who ONLY have rated this movie. Looks like bots..."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing visuals, great lore and world building, very good story and a fantastic setup for the next part. Eagerly waiting for Part 2 and the uncut R rated directors cut. The last 40 minutes is just mind blowing. Zack has done it again. A solid 8.5/10."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es un soplo de aire fresco dentro de las franquicias espaciales. Da lo que promete, una historia sencilla y f√°cil de digerir pero un viaje hermoso y que promete escalar a niveles √©picos. Recomendado"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's like Starwars, if Starwars had zero charm."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a great film, a really good build to what will probably be the defense of the settlement... Jax"" SOA"" character was a bit cheezy but he is dead now so thank god for that"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I thought it was great from the beginning to the end!! 10/10. Watch it!!
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not his best work, but had some interesting ideas that I enjoyed.  Some of those needed to be fleshed out a bit more.  Maybe they will in Part 2 or in a longer director's cut.  Also the acting wasn't the best in certain scenes, but I still liked most of the characters.  The visuals were amazing for the most part.  Overall I found it entertaining and I'll probably watch a second time before part 2 releases."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful cinematography, special effects, story, characters, universe, environments, just an epic movie, Masterpiece"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Cringe female lead. Cliche dialoges. Pathetic  story.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"You'll only like REbel Moon if you want to like it...
And I don't think you'll like it even then.
There's no way to get it."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Really bad lots of scene where just copy of other past movie scene... and the story is shitty be honest I seen a lots of movie and by far this one goes on the worst one I saw.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Near the beginning of the movie, don't let the giant vagina with the phallic spaceship passing through it turn you off. It's gets a little better, not much though."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Decent but the editing felt as if they have completely skipped important plot details.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Completely raw thoughts as I watch. Premise is 7 Samurai + Dune / Star Wars. The village and villagers are as naive and ignorant as the ones in 7 Samurai. The Motherworld army / space nazis (actually more like space soviets) are ruthless as the Empire's / First Order's troopers. Replace the protagonists of Star Wars with 7 Samurai, replace 1/2 the plot of Star Wars with 7 Samurai (Instead of a death star and farm boy becoming a jedi, it's farmers and ""outcasts"" vs space warmongers. Ngl i also see some references to like Clash of the Titans, when Tarak (Tarzan duh; side note: dude looks like he could pull off as Tarzan) was riding the bennu similary to how Perseus was riding Pegasus. Dunno why this movie also gives me Warhammer vibes; probably the outfits and weapons. Also gives me Bungie games vibes, especially D2; from how some of the lore is presented, some of the cg scenes (kinda feels like game cutscenes or sortta like cg from Tron; but that's fair enough considering tech advances and budget), some of the movements and skills. Tbh I'm fine with slo-mo scenes in films, I feel like there were some moments where it's unecessary or a little too much. Love the twist with Kai (side note: rewatch 7 samurai if there was ever a betrayal like this). Last battle between Kora and Noble reminds me of Rogue One. The scene when all 6 of them were side-by-side was for sure a call back to ZSJL / JL ending where the 6 were together. Noble definitly got Darth Vader treatment at the end (2nd chance at life by his master) can't wait to see the threat he'll become next. Scoring is great overall. For context 7 samurai was like 3 and 1/2 hours long so this film would ofc feel incomplete without it's part 2 since the premise is pretty much 7 samurai. Overall, i'd say it was a good film. If the cut / R+ version is better when it releases I'll revisit scoring."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"the movie is a spectacle for sure.  There is a bit too much feeling of a montage through the middle of the movie, and it would benefit from some more development of the main cast, perhaps cutting out one or two and saving them for the sequel.  I'd really like to see the extended cut. Definitely coming back for Part Two."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Tired of hearing it rips off Star Wars. Just cause it's in space and good vs evil. Its an excellent first part. Loved it.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I watched this movie last night and greatly enjoyed it. I was engrossed in the beautifully rendered world. The dialogue, character development, and visuals are top notch. Ignore the critics ands see this one for yourself. The is chapter 1 in an immense and engaging world. I can't wait to see more!!"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"La pel√≠cula tiene una buena trama, los efectos aunque no son extraordinarios est√°n bastante bien logrados y tiene un buen ritmo que mantiene a la audiencia"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, great action, awesome start.  Can't wait for the R rated version to drop."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was great set up for a sci-fi epic, cannot wait for part 2."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"The crawling mechanisms they used to detain people were sick! 

The scene in the bar where the alien creature was using the human as a surrogate was surreal. 

The droid was surprisingly wholesome in the scene with the young girl. (Definitely needed more screen time.)

There's alot of creative details to marvel at in this space opera."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Siempre me han gustado las pel√≠culas que reclutan h√©roes, luchadores, soldados, etc. Para enfrentar a tiranos. Rebel Moon tiene esa cuota de todo y es un nuevo universo de personajes, espero se puedan explotar a todos y con habilidades m√°s √∫nicas. Excelente"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Really exciting movie. Great story and characters. Some special effects aren't perfect but still looking good. I'm hyped for part two!
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great intro into the new universe of Rebel Moon. You get the Star Wars vises, you get the 7 Samuraj vibes and it all works. Visual stunning and a story that really puts you on alert with some interesting twistes. The store is a slamdunk and Junkie XL really delivers on a high note. The PG13 version you can tell has some loops and holes in it regarding story but the directors cut and Part 2 will according to information solve that.

I really enjoyed this new IP and I cannot wait for Part 2 and the DC cut."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm not a fan of sci-fi movies but this movie really changed my perspective.. from the story, to the visuals, score, like damn this movie really touched me. might look out the director of this movie and watch more of his content."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Why?  Yikes.  The trailer looked bad.  The show is worse.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It was Amazing! If you are into sci-fi you'll love it.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is beautiful considering the budget. Story was good that it sets up the next movie. Awesome visuals and great cast. Can't wait for Part 2
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautiful imagery and a story that makes you hunger for more! Not sure why the special ""critics"" don't like it!"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing action sequences and the sound was incredible. Loved the artistic use of images while world building and the slow motion shots to create a sense of intensity. Also the weapons held a major upgrade of lethality over star wars blasters. The laser projectiles and sound emitted from them was fantastic.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"An absolute epic movie, I loved every second of it. It has everything you could ask for in a movie. Zack Snyders has brought us another masterpieceüî•üíú I am looking forward to Part 2 üíú"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pros - Good visuals, good fights, acting is good, music is okay.
Cons - no character buildup, bad editing, fights are very short, not a gripping story. 

But will definitely watch part 2."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just terrible. Couldn't finish
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pure excellence! Zack has created another masterpiece! Performances, cinematography costumes, CGI was amazing! Can't wait for part 2."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Dark scifi greatness.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Abysmal, indulgent and clich√©d"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,This was a 135 minute unskippable cutscene
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie had potential. I think my main issue is the fact that the characters still fall victim to Zack's tendency of portraying people as regal, kinda mechanic, macho, rigid characters. It makes it difficult to sympathize with any, and makes the bad acting more glaring. The bad dialogues didn't help either. I think if a better writer had polished the script a bit, we might have had much better movie. All the same, I'll watch anything Zack puts out,  because his aesthetics are 2nd to none. 2.5/5"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyed the Ride. It is kind of a Star Wars rip-off but still good.  We need an Adult version rated ""R"" then it would be GREAT!"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie üçø was great. The characters are amazing. The movie looks beautiful. He created a wonderful universe. Watch it. The Critics are wrong about this one.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not as bad as the ""professional"" critics say. I'd say if your into sci-fi it's worth giving a chance. I'd have rated it higher but some scenes really needed a bit more dialog. Be aware the cast is heavy in the c list category."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Solid action, interesting cast, believable acting and way more fun than StarWars! Would recommend."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is exactly what you get if you wanted a grim dark star wars in the same vein as chronicles of riddick.
Acting and visuals are okay though it feels like half the movie is a slow motion action scene.
I had high hopes for a space opera like mass effect but this fell short. Did have a few good moments but honestly felt like someone had written a teenage fantasy novel and decided to market it as a sci-fi.
Worth a watch if you have a spare few hours but hardly stacks up to some of the other recent sci-fi movies or shows currently out there. Let's hope the second part packs more of a punch."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Exposition, back story, orange, slow motion.
Exposition, back story, orange, slow motion.
Expo... You get the idea.

It's a decent popcorn movie to pass time, with the pace of a series. Though, maybe that's the slow motion talking...  because it's just way too over done. Every action scene is 50-60% slo-mo.

Many scenes feel like they were born from a ""wouldn't it be cool if"" conversation between college freshmen. Just didn't stick with me."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Kind of nice to look at but extremely boring and derivative of better sci-fi epics. Characters are cardboard and get no development. The bad guys are the same space Nazis you've seen a million times.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,gostei muito do filme vale apena conferir
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Can't wait for the next one
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Rebel Moon is a terrible movie that copies from better movies and ruins them. The movie is full of Star Wars references, but they are lame and boring. It is about a girl who fights an evil empire with a laser sword, a half-vampire prince who is a rip-off of Blade, a spider queen who is a match up of Queen of the Damned and Charlotte's Web, a Nazi who is a rip-off of Schindler's List, and a robot who is a rip-off of Bicentennial Man. Not to mention the highlight was the action sequence from a rip-off Mulan meets Asajj Ventress. It  is also full of starships that look weird rip-off MCU. The movie's aesthetics and sounds are also rip-off of Dune, but they are dull and annoying. Wish I can have those 2hrs back."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Originality lost in the shadows of the moon.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Stellar movie and a great star wars competitor
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it was a good movie, better than the last four Star wars at least! They should have let him do this in the Star wars franchise..."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I love the Science Fiction and Fantasy genres and expected this to tick alot of boxes for me but boy this definitely didn't feel like a Cinematic experience.

The writing? Lazy. Characters are all two dimensional and every ""twist"" is super predictable. Dont get me wrong it has moments that have genuinely intrigued to see how they will play out in the second installment but those moments account for approximately 5 percent of the movie. Oh and some of the effects? Would have easily been at home in the early 2000's had to remind myself during one particular scene that I was not in fact watching an Anime show 

Sadly the whole film feels incredibly rushed and what could have been great became a predictable poorly written piece of mediocrity"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It's was just fun to watch! Reminded me of old-school action flicks I loved back in the day. I am excited for the next one.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was an amazing movie, absolutely the best movie of 2023! Can't really say to much more without giving spoilers."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great story building and beautiful shots. It was a bit too short though... I feel like this should have been a 5-8 episode series instead and give each character recruitment a full arc and story.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was good but it a old school Star Wars day like late 90s Star Wars it was enjoyable this was a few scenes that was rush but some of cgi and VFX were not good but only like for 2 scenes but I give it a rating 7.3/10
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,This felt more like watching a video game of the characters back stories . If you enjoy watching spacecrafts takeoff and land you will love this flick . And don't get me started on the overuse of random slowmotion . Oh and did I mention the strange gazing between characters it's like they are hiding a funny side joke .
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Its called ""part one"" and thats what it is plus some. Beautiful world building, great action scene. Well designed characters and Lore. The downside for most a believe is simply expecting to see the big climax of story but this is the build. ""Part one"" so watch it with this in mind just like Dune part one. This is the world builder. In saying that im very excited to see the R18 directors cut that will flesh the world out even more and really show the devastation of battle scenes. Its a good time."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed this film quite a bit. I really gravitated towards the main character. I thought Boutella was excellent. The film could've been much longer and delved into the other characters a bit more, but I still loved the universe, the story, the film score by junkieXL as well as the action scenes. That is really given us something to get excited about as a film series"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I think there is a persecution of Snider, because every film he makes, critics say a lot of bad things about it, but his films are good."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Some of the choreography in the action scenes was great. Sophia Boutella gets the job done. But the dialogue was cheesy and too much of the storytelling was in the form of exposition.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"movie was amazing simple story with amazing world and lore, the characters are amazing too just we could get to know the bit more, maybe if it was an 1 hour maybe it would be good but other then that a good move for charismas"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Its fine. Certainly better then the last 2 Star Wars trilogy movies.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Solid 8/10 movie. Entertaining, beautiful visually and a great score. Cant wait for the director's cut and part 2."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was kind of fresh to have a new universe to enjoy, like if you are a bit tired of the superhero genre. It was fun and some really good visuals. Alot of entertainment, wich was nice and it felt like almost to short, that fast.. 
Also nice pacing. And liked the way it evolved."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love the first installment of this movie, I thought that each character brought something unique and vital in order to fully round out the crew. The universe is awesome, and I just want to know more about it!! Can't wait for part two."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Shocking movie - visual effects were decent but the overal story and more worrying the acting were terrible.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Where do I start. 
Visually stunning! 
From the start, had me tugging at my heart strings especially over Jimmy the robot. 
Being over 2 hours long and still left me wanting MORE! 
Can't wait to see what's next in part two. 
Well done."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Utter incompetence at every level.
Writing,producing, directing, and acting. Cheap and dreary looking despite its cost. Whole scenes and characters stolen from other, better movies. Actors who seem like they would rather be anywhere else."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Epic, StarWars killer. 10/10"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Pretty entertaining movie
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not as bad as what the critics are saying, it's not great but I had a good time watching it. Not a fan of all the slow mo action scenes though."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Comparisons to Star Wars are a bit lazy. The movie is more low key and aimed at the streaming audience that will have more patience than legacy media. The story landed really well for me and reminded me more of classic video games like Homeworld than anything else. I hope they make more stories in this world.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Feels like a bad star wars film. This could've been so good... but it's not. I want to love the characters, but there's no depth provided. There's also CG moments that take you out of it. They probably should've broken this into more parts so they had more time to develop the characters."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually amazing and good acting across the board. Simple prototypes and a great start, escapism and engaging film. It feels unkind to judge this movie so harshly, but I'm hopeful there will be more regardless of the critic views."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The visuals were mostly on the amazing side (with some really bad CGI thrown in at random and lens flare for some reason) but dear lord, the plot and characters were terrible. The dialogue was just flat and unmotivated. It read like a DnD group starting an adventure without actually role-playing their character's motivations for joining. No one really resisted joining. 

There was no real connection with the side characters. We never really saw too much of their living situations or even personality from any of them so I felt no connection to anyone involved. The music was telling me to feel awed by a line delivery or a speech but the audience has no real reason to care.  It was disappointing to be TOLD things and not shown them. You want to tell me the general is a tactical genius? Okay, but he didn't do any thing to warrant that description.  Exposition dump on Kora's back-story? You tell me she's a badass and her flashbacks sometimes reflect that but she has stormtrooper aim. 

Also, we were shown the dreadnaught can fire bomb a planet from orbit. It seems supremely silly for farmers to fight it. Maybe they should have been looking for a whole fleet of pirates to take on the warhammer 40k ship.

I felt genuinely bad for Tarak though. No one thought to give him a shirt all movie. He went from desert planet to the cold of space. No shirt."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Enjoyed very much, thank you."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was a really fun ride! The universe feels lived in and the action scenes are cool. Yes I turned my brain off and I enjoyed a movie. Lots of loose ends, they make introduce every character as if they we're super important and don't do much with them after but there's 2 more movies and now I can't wait to watch them."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Seriously I don't know why the critics gave this low ratings..Rebel Moon is so awesome, loved everything in it.. Can't wait for the Director's Cut & Part 2"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved the movie, the cinematography and obviously the world building
Waiting for 2nd part"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Oofff, is this a ripoff of Seven Samuri or Battle Beyond the Stars?  What else did it ripoff...I saw a Space Battleship Yamato, a starship troops brain bug, some furiosa eye makeup, lightsabers, a droid with feelings, necromonger armor, a borg queen, a nazi officer, a nice guy who sells them out, Thanos on some astral plane.  Truely amazing, almost devoid of any orginality and not even a wink to the audience acknowledging it."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Epic. Finally something different. Part 2 is coming soon too. This universe will be amazing and keep growing. Zack = Goat
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall a good sci/fantasy flick. It's easy to point out its flaws, which are only due to runtime, but the good is GOOD"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was pretty good, if a bit derivative."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Very enjoyable Sci-Fi rollercoaster ride.  I am very impressed with Zack's directing skills the talented actors.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"this movie was pretty awesome‚Ä¶remember this is only part one, i would highly recommend to judge yourself as we live in an age today where noone is satisfied the same anymore and everyone want you to believe their opinions, and everyone wants to compare the success and bad parts of any movie to another movie they watched when they were 10. everything was better when you were 10 you were a child. Rebel Moon has Stat Wars ascetics, yes, but its not star wars and uses action scenes and tries to tell a story.. even though you might not know every characters backstories on this film remember its only part one‚Ä¶this movie has a huge cast, they do quick intro and as the movie progress we find out more about the main characters past and how she is linked to army conquering the galaxy. to give much spoilers, take everything everyone says with a grain of salt and judge it yourself, some people are quick to say Zack Synder lost his way. This movie doesnt get 5 stars in my book cuz for me the pacing is slow but it shows potential for part 2‚Ä¶again if we are comparing this to Star Wars not every Star Wars movie was mind blowing‚Ä¶. people like SW episode 5 more than episode 4 and 6.. some like the new trilogy some hate it, most despite the disney ones‚Ä¶some like it‚Ä¶and we all still think as a whole SW is amazing. Give Rebel Moon a chance and judge yourself."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"A very exhilarating movie from beginning to end , I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen with all the visuals and sounds . The story was a bit clunky but enjoyable nonetheless ."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I swear this movie was a star wars film. It's so similar. I did enjoy it but I probably won't watch part 2 due to the wait.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Sci fi action film that felt fresh but also familiar. Great evening entertainment.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I like it! I was hooked in the 1st 30mins. Can't wait for Part 2.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,This is an amazing movie.  I cant wait for part 2 and the dc. Beautiful and wished it was 4 hours long.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Rebel Moon is a great sci-fi cinema with the story progression giving it's just part 1. It's a thrilling adventure that keeps you engaged especially with the fight scenes and interesting storytelling. 

Fans of Star Wars also to anyone who loves a good story and amazing movie should watch it. I can't wait for Part 2 in April 2024."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was a movie I was looking forward to, but just found it boring. Just another generic sci-fi movie."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I went in with low expectations given the critic reviews, but damn was I surprised how good this universe is. Very life-like and heartfelt."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,So much to unpack definitely need a rewatch but man can it be April already i need more of this!!!
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I genuinely loved this movie. It's the Sci-Fi space opera that I have been waiting for. Definitely gives off Star Wars vibes and I love it even if the out of touch critics do not.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Rebel Moon looked great and when it took its time had great writing. The first act is paced very well and focuses on world building while the third act feels very rushed. There is a directors cut coming that will hopefully fix some of the pacing issues and add to some of the side characters. The main villian of this film was excellent in his role.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Honestly I think the reviews are kind of harsh. I thought it was entertaining and I look forward to watching the 2nd one.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,just one word INCREDIBLE !üçø
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Sooo not good. Dialogue not great. Muddled character motivations. So not good.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visually it's like the Heavy Metal magazine come to life. Looking forward to the directors cut because this trimmed version feels half baked. Not nearly as bad as everyone is saying but also not his best work. A+ for effort and creating something ""new"" I.E. derivative of other things we've seen before but at least he's trying."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Just boring. I think Zack is great at visual aspects but when it comes to story aspects, he sucks. Just let other writers create decent stories for hi,. WatchMen was great because the original story had been already great and Zack added visual depth to it. He cannot write. That's the obvious fact at this moment. I mean, you remember how bad the script for Batman v Superman, right?"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed this part one of the Rebel Moon Saga. The critics have been way too harsh. This movie has some amazing visuals, yes it lacks a form of character building and feels a little incomplete, but it's part one and there is a director's cut that awaits. I did however really like being in this Universe and I can see the audience scoring rising much hire in the next week.  This movie reminded me of 300 in space and I really enjoyed it for that. It sure did fly by which means I was having a good time so I'm gonna give it a score that rates my experience. Give us Scargiver Please!"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's fun. I love Zack Snyder's movies, but I honestly expected much much more. The story felt too superficial, I couldn't connect with it. Still a fun movie."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"2-hour character presentation, with uninteresting characters and plot that is only a prelude to the second part. With a lot of elements taken from other movies.
With good cinematography and cool special effects that still cannot save a terrible script."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Just finished and  I loved it. The world building was so engaging.  It gave so much context into what was happening. The characters were fully developed. This was so much more movie than the sw prequels.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not a perfect movie but a good  start to a new franchise. I think it would have worked better as a series and had more character development. The recruiting seemed a bit rushed and unrealistic. I give it 3/5 for effort. Will certainly be watching Part 2.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Rebel Moon"" astounds with its breathtaking visuals, unveiling a mesmerizing new universe. Boasting an exceptional cast delivering stellar performances, it diverges from conventional space sagas. Its thought-provoking species and gripping storyline leave audiences eagerly anticipating the next installment.The critics are wrong. A must see!"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love Zack Snyder's flair and directing style. The acting is great, the cast is great, I was engrossed through out the whole movie. I love that each character has their own motive to join."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Perhaps the critics would prefer the Disney renditions of the Marvel Universe (which are generally not even worth watching any more), but the low ratings for this movie are nonsensical. Rebel Moon is not perfect, but it is pretty damn good and so much better than most everything in the theaters since Dune."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Awesome Visually, first 20 minutes were great‚Ä¶ characters weren‚Äôt developed at all. It felt like you took a 10 hour movie and cut it down to 2 1/2‚Ä¶ leaving a jumbled mess. "
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Some cool bits. Some visual set pieces like the planets were very nice. The plot is straighter than a Roman road with any slight deviations telegraphed from miles away. 
Massively overused slow mo/bullet time so that when it should have been poignant/important it just wasn't. 

Spoiler




Somehow Francis Returned!"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"WAY better than those ""critics"". Do people seriously pay for their opinions? Is that a real job? Regardless, their reviews are worthless and this is by far infinitely better than the sequel films."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was like giving a teenager a couple hundred million to make a movie. Shallow, predictable and blatantly derivative. Could have been so much better with an ounce of thought given to the storyline, a bit more realism and dialogue not written by children."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Had a slow start at first due to backstop then got good
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Lower your expectations. It was enjoyable and was a good first half of a 2 part movie. Best movie ever? No. Grab some popcorn and enjoy it for what it is.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is .... Good.  Not great. Not perfect. But it's off to a 'good' start. I will watch Part 2.
Get past Zach Synder's compulsion to over-use slow-motion, and the action scenes are good too.
He does love slow-mo tho."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"siento que esta muy apresurada la pelicula, quiere contarlo todo muy r√°pido, el guion es flojo pero aceptable."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"An awesome space epic with brilliant action and world building, can definitely see that scenes were cut from the film to keep it's PG13 rating so I am definitely looking forward to the extended R rated version and part 2.
Definitely form your own opinion by watching this movie"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,It's a solid sci-fi experience. There just something off that doesn't deserve 5 stars. The CGI is not the best along with lighting. Way to much slow motion effects. Solid story but bad character development.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring rehash of so many movies. Characters and plot point are like he just scrapped tvtropes with an ai. Watched it twice trying to figure out why I should care about the characters. Still couldn't remember half of their names. If you just want Snyders aesthetic, and don't care if the plots engaging, it's probably for you.  Just watch any of his better, older films, this one is tired."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie and a fantastic start to this epic franchise. Can't wait for the director's cut of part one and for part 2.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,I didn't fall asleep (I always fall asleep) and I love me some high budget sci fi & fantasy.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved it. 

The critics especially on this site are liars. 

Watch it for yourself. I love serious films like Oppenheimer, and Killers of the Flower Moon‚Ä¶ but this is a movie I can engage with and have fun watching. This is MY Star Wars. I couldn't ever get into Star Wars, but I loved this movie and can't wait for the sequels and more."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Zack Snider is like a music video director and I will explain.

He is not in the service of the story. What he does, is try to create ""cinematic moments but,,, he can't ""mix"" his attempts at continus ""cinematic moments"" in the editing room as none of them match each other in tones, colors or ambiences.
It worked great in ""300"" as he only had 1 storyline to tell, but as soon as you add a second one,, it becomes harder.    

 

If you watch a K-pop or rap music video and you have people dancing to it, most of the time, these people can't dance pretty well so, they make cuts (like in a fight scene where people can't really fight) to present them in their best light and here is where it bogs down.

The lighting for all these scenes, never has any continuity as the scene's lighting is reset to re-give the best light for the next cut of that scene. There is no shadow game to emphasize the story telling and what you are getting is a ""picture"" that moves instead of a scene.
If you look carefully at the different angles of camera happening in the same scene, you will notice that the shadows are not in the same place on the actors and the sets behind them as the scene goes on.  

Now, if you take that ""Moving picture"" and use a volume screen, green screen or CGI,, the lighting (that is already not working) is really not working in the completed scene as the entire lighting isn't matching and that give you that feeling of coldness which is now the trademark of Snider. 

 

That blue or red/orange hue that he is known for, isn't a signature skill. It's what happens when you desaturate, reduce exposure and crank the contrast up in your video editing software to hide imperfections in your footage.

Speaking of color grading in this movie, it's all over the place. You will notice that we jump from an orange hue in one scene, to a blue hue, then to a classic cinematic hue in an other without any reasons for it. 
In movie making, the use of these hues are there to emphasize the mood of a scene or a story line. It could be also used to differentiate locations but,,,,,, in this movie, the changes are done for no apparent reasons and sometimes in the same fucking scene. 

This is why besides the script and the acting, this movie is unwatchable. There is no redeeming qualities to it.

If you take other Snider movies, they all had redeeming quality. 
In 300, the script was garbage but the visuals saved the movie (Cinematic moments)
In Man of Steel, the script wasn't great but the visuals (until the final fight scene) saved the movie plus, it's fucking Superman. (Cinematic moments)
In the Watchmen, the script saved the movie as the acting was atrocious. 

Not in this movie. Nothing can save it."

"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a beatiful movie , i love this moon"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't get the hate, this movie was awesome! Rich lore, great lead, stunning visuals, and a truly menacing villain. The complaints about it being a Star Wars ripoff are overblown, however the movie makes no secret of its influences and wears them proudly on its  sleeve. Can't wait for part two!"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Restored my faith in sci fi. Gravity over irony, great actors, classic tale, nothing cutesy just 100% enthralling adventure. Expected to hate, shocked to totally love."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm onboard for a franchise. It reminded me why I liked Star Wars originally but did what Disney is afraid to do and added a little John Wick, 300 type edge. I loved how the characters were introduced. Removed all the fluff. Took me on a love/hate rollercoaster. I will spend my money on this franchise. Give me more as soon as possible. Thank you."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"""Should we spend more time on storyline and dialogue?""

""Nah, pretty sure pointless action will do as long as we make it look cool. The dialogue can be super contrived with a plot that is meh.""

""Should we a least make the action scenes somewhat believable within the sci-fi realm of our own creation?""

""Nah.""

""So we basically assume the audience is super dumb and won't care?""

""Exactly."""
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning, mild story pacing issues but overall made me feel like I was watching Warhammer 40K Star Wars and that was fine. All of the tech and species of aliens and cultures definitely have me hoping there's an extended universe or franchise that comes."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fresh take on a group of rebels taking on the forces of an empire. Awesome visual FX, score, and sound editing. The film is a beautiful masterpiece and I can't wait to see Part Two."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"They slow mo'd the slow mo. This was just bad. As a sci fi fanatic I wanted to enjoy this film oh so much. It was an immediate disappointment. It was then hilarious to make fun of until well, it wasn't."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Rebel Moon cuts a critical path through an immense, lived-in universe with history and drops plenty of inside references to events, people, and places just beyond our current horizons to tantalize viewers for the future, all while delivering a cohesive narrative that is incredibly fun to watch."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall I enjoyed it.  It's rare we get new IP's in general let alone a new space epic with hints of Dune and Warhammer 40k as inspiration.  The only thing I wish was improved is character development.  We really don't have a good idea of who the ""heroes"" are.  I honestly didn't even know most of their names until the end of the film.  Looks like more character insights will come in part 2 based off the trailer.  Looking forward to it."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is old school fun meets new school technology.  Don't listen to the critics. It's clearly a ""part one"" which should excite viewers for the second part rather than feel it is far too open-ended as some reviews suggest. The story is not the best ever written‚Ä¶ but let's not pretend some of our favorite cultural films have been the best of the best. Rebel Moon is worth your time."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What in the world did I just watch? This movie is soulless, cold, and utterly shallow. Am I supposed to care about any of these characters? The pacing is a mess, there's almost no meaningful character development, and the visual effects look very cheap and unfinished. I've played video games with more realistic visual effects. This movie is so obviously a cheap knock off. It's no wonder Disney passed on this."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics are crazy! That movie was awesome! Style to spare, cool characters, incredible effects and design. Just flat out cool!"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie!  While many people are complaining and calling this a Star Wars rip off, I would have to disagree. I loved all the nods to other films and the little snippets here and there from other films such as Star Wars, Dune, Harry Potter and probably so many more. I honestly look forward to watching it again and seeing what other pieces have been so obviously loved by the writers that they put these things into this film. They have taken things that have been done before just like any other writer and film maker and spun it into something of their own while creating something new and mesmerizing. I would of liked to of seen a little more characterization and build up to the extra characters that were being recruited in the film, as I dont feel much level of attachment to them. I felt more attachment to the spider lady with her little speech about the mines and what has been done to her. I felt more
 for her than a recruited good guy. But overall I really liked this Film. A little bit of the cgi looked goofy in a few spots ,particularly a flying animal scene. But I can overlook that. I am very happy to see more SciFI/ Fantasy being made. I look forward to the next installment."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great adaptation of previous films. For sure Elements of magnificent 7 but with its own take. Part one is a great lore building for the 2nd part. Can't wait for the sequel.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Actually really good I wonder those credited reviewers what where they on ? Lol I was expecting it to be bad with their fake reviews but nope it was really good considering that it's part 1.  Compaired to some other movies  that they gave 90 to 100 this is much better ü§≠ oh yea don't forget to check those who rated it 2  stars and rated only this movie I bet those are the critics üòÇ or bots
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Guardians of the indiana wars... cant say i hate it i will watch the rest. Its a familiar genere that is done very well. Did it blow my mind? No. But keep it coming because snacks are nice in between dinner
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"i thought it was good. But Honestly none of this rotten tomato stuff is really necessary. You like what you like, And enjoy what u enjoy. Its never that deep.If it interests you, Watch it."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Although we all know there's a r rated cut coming. The film definitely felt fast paced in the 2nd act. It felt like it was just ships landing in different worlds and recruiting people after people without getting to know them. And the lens that was used in movie did annoyed me. But these two issues didn't affect how much I enjoyed this movie! Looking forward to part 2, this movie leaves you wanting more!"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The combat/action is really well done with the injury's looking real like nobles broken arm at the end looked amazing the barn fight scene looked great not being R is what ruined it a bit.‚Ä®The characters are great but they just don't interact very often especially when they have created the team so more in part two I hope.‚Ä®Noble was a scene stealer every time I saw him In a shot I just got exited such a good villain and the way they brought him back was cool I do have a lot of questions about that scene though.

Character Development there is non at all now I know it's only a part one but there has to be some to make the journey worth it.‚Ä®The dialogue is not very good is written very clunky and just not very good it comes of as a mouth full every time there is a interaction now I understand that he's trying to communicate a lot in one movie but that is still no excuse

Overall 
7.5/10"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Let's start off by saying that for a new IP it is incredible. The world building was exceptional and it kept me wanting to know more. Next comes the visuals, I cannot believe both this and the sequel cost around 166M combined. It makes me wonder where all the other high budget movies have been spending their money because they don't come nowhere near Rebel Moons quality. Action sequences are top notch as well, although it did feel like the slow Mo was used a tiny bit too liberally. The character exposition was ok just not great which is what took half a star from me. I feel like the extended version will fix a lot of the pacing and character exposition just like BvSUE did. 

Like many have said already, ignore the critics. If you are a fan of Star Wars, mass effect, just space operas in general, you owe it to yourself to give this movie a shot. You can decide if you like it or not after but at least give it a chance."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie just happens. It's not even fun bad. Go to planet,""hey come help us"", no, yes, no, ok fine I'll go, end scene, next planet.

It's bad, like bad bad. Not fun, acting is terrible, and the dialogue is just some random words thrown together.

Space gladiator, Space Conan.

Battlefield Earth > Rebel Moon."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"CGI muy b√°sico, visiblemente eran caballos con m√°scara para aparentar ser de otro mundo.
Esa quimera sale volando y aterriza como si no pesar√°. 
La hero√≠na pesa 50KG y vence a soldados de  de 120 KG o m√°s.
Las naves son propulsadas con motores de los a√±os 90s
Los soldados con aires de nazis pero con actitud de la caballer√≠a estadounidense matando apaches. 
Es una mala mezcla de varias pel√≠culas, no tiene nada de original la historia.
Me aburri√≥ a los 30 mins, y soport√© 15 mins m√°s y deje de verla, y aqu√≠ estoy aportando mi mala experiencia con est√° pel√≠cula"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Sci-Fi epic with lots of action and beautiful scenery. Need to cut back a bit on the slow mo, but overall fun to watch. Wish there was a bit more character development, but maybe that will happen in future features. Please be rated R going forward, could be more fun. Star Wars nerds will complain but as a sci-fi geek this was entertaining and please make more."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Characters are bland and cliche, the story is full of typical sci-fi stereotypes from dozens of other stories."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Started slow but oh man! Really Good can't wait for Rabel part 2
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was good, you can definitely see the bones of a star wars script, add a dash of magnificent 7 with a warhammer 40k coat of paint and overall you get a pretty good movie. Characters could have been more developed but that's my only criticism."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Can't wait for the R version for the not so Disney Adults, enjoy your 50$ !"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great start to a series. What is obvious is the visual appeal. What isn't obvious is mystery in every character and how the backstory of each changes the narrative with every detail revealed. Love it.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Very enjoyable looking forward to part 2
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It's amazing. I love this movie
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire was gorgeous. It gave me that Grand Space Opera feel that I've been craving for a very long time. This feels like Seven Samurai and Star Wars in all the best ways and I cannot wait for Part Two: The Scargiver! I NEED the extended cut because I want to know more of this stunning new universe. This has the potential to become an absolute juggernaut of a franchise and if 'A Child of Fire' is the first step I'm with it every step of the way. My one gripe is I wish I was able to see this on the big screen. 4 out of 5 stars for me. For the Rebellion.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,A Seven Samurai worthy reimagination more than a StarWars wannabe. A complete universe worth to see! Can't wait for what's coming!
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Filled with obvious sci-fi tropes from multiple franchises and does not build upon them. Uneven acting, strange use of camera angles and out of focus filming, and the now overused 'mary sue' where the main character is a perfect and undefeated female with no development or depth. The overarching story is basically Blazing Saddles in the Star Wars universe with strong Warhammer 40k themes and overtones."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love Zach's style, it wasn't a masterpiece but the movie flowed well and was very entertaining. A lot of parallels to the Warhammer 40K universe which sold me on the movie right away. I thought it was definitely good enough for a part one leaving plenty of room for the part to be improved upon. Simple answer I enjoyed the film."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"A fantastic start of a new space sci-fi universe. While it does have slight pacing issues in the middle of the movie, the action, spectacle and word building are all worthy of immersing yourself in this new universe."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Characters are undeveloped and the lead actress is terrible. This movie had such great potential. An incredible misfire.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,6 Star Movie no doubt. Love the character build up only thing I didn't like is killing my man Jaxs.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Predictable with interesting visuals. It's not bad but it's not great. The pep talks were basic and uninspired. The assembly of fighters was just as you'd expect with no surprises. Visually, this sci-fi world is fairly interesting. The plot & dialogue, however, seem very typical and flat. I wasn't a fan of the action scenes. There was a lot of slow motion that got old pretty quickly."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Visually it's incredible. In every other way‚Äìacting, story, direction‚Äìit's just meh. That's not true. The acting is largely terrible."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,A nice epic sci-fi movie.  Can't wait for pt 2
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Lenta y aburrida, el 80% de la pel√≠cula se trata de ir de punto A a punto B a punto C, los personajes no son presentados realmente solo los vemos pero no conocemos nada de ellos m√°s all√° de di√°logos de exposici√≥n y el supuesto cl√≠max est√°n soso que no emociona nada ni parece que sea el final de la pel√≠cula."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I've never been more bored by something so beautiful.

Dialogue is horrid. The only saving grace is that something like Warhammer 40k could work visually."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,I really loved this movie!! Its super fun and a lot of action. Definitely worth a watch
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Cool sci-fi world that was an audio visual treat!
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Visually stunning the costumes and art design is absolutely beautiful but was clearly been written by a child. It was almost unwatchable.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Pg-13 killed it for me
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Best scifi producto this year. I want a series and more m√≥viles. I need now
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was an excruciating 2 hours. I mean, it is visually stunning but i really wish it had some unique storytelling or a better script"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Felt like nonstop plagiarism and stupidity. Pacing was pretty terrible. CGI was terrible. Endless pile of tropes masquerading as a movie.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Movie was amazing! Why is everyone being so whiney about it!?
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Rebel Moon movie is Awesome. Did Critics watch some other movie? Story Building is good, which makes audience to Patiently wait for Rebel Moon part 2."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"So many ideas, characters, and scenes borrowed from other films. Still, some fun action makes it worth a look."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Can't wait for Part 2 and the directors cut to flesh it out which could bring it to 5 stars...this is just the beginning though which is important to remember. Some great moments, some average moments but overall pretty cool"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,A great BGM with good direction. Made my day.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"After reading the critics reviewes my expectations were very low. I'm glad I don't listen to them often. I had a good time watching the movie. I agree, you don't get A lot of time to connect with characters, but it was still cool."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This was an interesting story and had its moments. I must say the visuals was amazing in this movie.  No dark-spots and all the fighting was crystal clear. I could actually see the fight scenes. But, with that said the world building felt rushed but I understand why because it doesn't have any other lore to go off of so they had to cram all the back stories together in this movie! I would have liked to see  a character with some type of special abilities. They have the  capability to fly from galaxy to galaxy but nobody have any special abilities is wild to me. It wasn't anything special about the villain of the movie he actually fell pretty easily to 5 bandits which we only got to see one fight at the end which is a total bummer!!! Why go look for people to team up with and you only showcase the main character fight scenes!! It was pointless of having us go through the back story of the others for them to only showcase the main character at the end!! It was also obvious that the thief was going to double cross them nobody had suspicions of him wasn't logical at all."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was a Frankenstein's moster of franchises, mythologies, and genres. It was a spoof that took itself to seriously and yet entertaining. I am not a fan of most of the stylistic choices made but I will be watching part two when it comes out."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Couldnt even make it to the end of part one
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Its as terrible as the reviews claim. Just one nonsensical ""action"" scene after another. Unlikable protagonist mixed with terrible writing. I wont be surprised if part 2 is never released."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Very interesting movie. Not ground breaking but a great story that leaves you wanting more.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie. Has everything the start of a Space Opera should have. Hoping that this story will run past 2 movies. Cannot wait for part 2.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie has a ton of different science fiction tropes, but none of the characters or worlds we see even get enough substance behind them to make the world building feel real."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very beautiful movie, the music, photography and the action scenes were great. I want to see more."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Plot pretty good, It should of being done like a rated R 80s action movie. To pack a punch. They wasted a opportunity to set the trend."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie looks nice but moves so slow and the dialogue is so boring.  The action is ok, but every fight has too many slow motion scenes."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Was it on par with Dune? No. But it didn't need to be - it's a fun popcorn sci-fi action movie. Went in with low expectations due to the critics score of 24%. I actually enjoyed the movie enough that I'm interested in the sequel and the R rated extended cut.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Visually dazzling and very cool universe and setting.  Needed to be longer to give more character exposition but overall a good time.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics lowered my expectations, however, they were wrong the movie is entertaining."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Zack is great at world building and this movie is visually stunning and action packed. Creating a new universe that feels familiar but different at the same time is no easy challenge but yet cast and crew deliver an amazing first episode. Can't wait for part 2!!!
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great characters; I wish we had more time with them. The worlds explored were interesting and stunning; can't wait to see more. I like the direction of the story. Only one complaint: some scenes could've benefited more without a long duration of slow motion. I would definitely recommend this to others.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I really wanted to like this. I love scifi and space operas inparticular, but blah. It could have subverted some expectations, but instead gave viewers exactly what they thought was going to happen. I've seen this story before and seen it better executed."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,The writing and lack of character development is just awful.  You are watching a 2 hour video game.  Thats what these movies have become.  Zero substance with zero emotional ties to any characters.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Solid movie. Ok acting, great action and great sequences. Star wars dorks probably think it's a rip of that and hate accordingly. Regardless of what they think of another show set in space not called star wars, this movie kicked ass."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing Movie cast and all can't wait for part 2
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"El mejor comienzo para una saga que promete competir con los m√°s grandes, buenos VFX, buena historia, buen worldbuilding, buen comienzo"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie ! Can't wait for part 2
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"While not perfect, it was a really entertaining ride! Can't watch for Part II!"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,The movie comes with bad lines bad acting and trash slow-mo action. There's more story telling than acting.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was pretty cringe. Just not good overall in every aspect.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a great movie visually, emotionally. A basic story but pretty epic."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"I want more!!!! can't wait for the r rated version, need it now !!!!"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Zack don't miss with high fiction. Can't wait for part two and director's cut.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Pretty decent sci-fi. Amazing visuals.  Less than fantastic dialogue. Felt very.... forced. All in all solid effort. Would recommend
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie is heavy on characters sharing long winded, badly written exposition. They don't show you who they are but they certainly tell you. In depth. With narrated flashbacks. Full of even more exposition. It's double exposition!  This movie is clearly trying to be Rogue One with worse acting, worse dialogue, a worse storyline. It's a failure on pretty much every level."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Cool background stories and exciting introductions to a team of rebels, beautifully shot, amazing battles and what seems to be a great start to a story that will conclude with a huge fight in part 2."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Highly imaginative but beyond the budget constraints you can see the amazing potential
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great start to a new world. Anxious to see more of what lies ahead. Acting, action, compelling story, betrayal, great heroes, great villain, all on point. Watch and simply enjoy."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not sure what I watched, the visuals where great and even all the alien characters looked great. But I do believe I have seen a lot of similar designs from somewhere but cant put my finger on it. The story was like a poorly written game, it was so bad and there is nothing more I can say on the matter."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Why all the hate from critics? This is such a great movie, worthy of cinemas. I know it's a part 1 but it can stand on it's own. Compelling story and great VFX. I am looking forward for the battle of the rebels in part 2!!!"
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Fabulous- the spider chick rocked
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Anyone who's gonna come in and auto-hate on this movie is an idiot. Was it like star wars? Sure if star wars was turned up to 11
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Every single aspect of this movie from top to bottom is half-baked at best, horrendously baffling at worst."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The unexplainable abuse of slow mo makes it feel like a cheap tv movie. Visuals are otherwise great, so it is a real pity. If you are into fantasy science fiction you will enjoy it anyway."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring and full of tropes, uninspired action scenes, clumsy writing."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Just finished and I'm hooked. Been waiting for a film like this since Dune. Just like any other movie it's ups and downs and questionable moments. But this is a franchise I'm truly behind and looking forward to and this first film. Man I'm hype. The ""critics"" on the other hand, wtf is wrong with all the hate? What film did ya watch? I'm confused."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,The critics are crazy.   This is a very good movie
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Soooo much slow mo action - way over used as he does. Characters for the most part are uninteresting to me.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Snyder's story telling continues to get worse with each movie ‚Ä¶ but now even his cinematography? His use of out of focus Lense for background objects is inconsistent and annoying at times‚Ä¶this was a hard movie to get through‚Ä¶ acting, story telling, world building, editing, production‚Ä¶ it's a mess"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Awful sets, even worst writing and acting, even the fight scenes are ultra bad"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie would be just an hour long if it wasn't that 45% of the movie is just ridiculous unnecessary slo-mo shots other than that movie is still pretty mid, good time killer I guess"
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One word, three times: LAZY, LAZY, LAZY! It's Seven Samurai meets Star Wars but with zero creativity or vision."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Thank you, Disney, for keeping Snyder's hands off of the Star Wars franchise! What a load of horse pucky. Made Rise of Skywalker look like Hamlet."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Lets just string together cliche after cliche, trope after trope. Its like they took cool scenes from every movie ever made then just jumbled it all together with some really epic slow motion action scenes.  As a fan of the genre, this will never be a Dune or a Starwars... it's just slightly better then Jupiter Ascending but definitely not as good as John Carter."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Wow, this movie is painful to watch.  Just bad pacing and poor direction.  The script... Looks bad even though there's a fair amount of good set dressing and design."
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"No idea why this movie gets all this hate. It's not perfect, but 24%..?? Someone was owed a bj and didn't get it."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,I wish I had trusted the reviews. Time is valuable and I just wasted mine.
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Nice movie .. an interesting film... and could be developed in a much bigger direction
"Dec 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"An incredibly creative new universe with strong action and Campbellian mythology. Great visual effects. While this is a part one like Dune or Infinity War, this story stands on its own. I'm excited for whats to come."
"Dec 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's a terribly disjointed version of 'Seven Samari' just in space, as has been done before with 'Battle Beyond the Stars'. It looks pretty for the most part but the story, pacing and characters are all lacking. The movie gives you no reason to care about the characters or what's happening. Recommend you give this one a miss!"
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Epic Movie and a visual and action filled buffet of art! Ray Fisher and the rest of the cast were outstanding!!  #rebelmoon
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Filme muito bom visualmente, tem um roteiro mediano mais √© assistivel"
"Dec 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,la pel√≠cula es un desastre la narrativa es horrible los efectos son muy buenos algo ya com√∫n del director que se le conoce como un profesional en efectos visuales pero siempre escoge un mal guion y una mala representaci√≥n representaci√≥n del el.
"Dec 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another example that Zack Synder is a phenomenal cinematographer, but poor story teller."
"Dec 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,Visual effects were great however the movie was nothing but a Hodge-podge of other movies thrown up into a boring storyline. I was hoping I would love it but it was such a let down.
"Dec 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was disappointed, so much potential yet so many missed opportunities. This is definitely not a good movie, not the worst movie ever either but it's certainly close."
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,Achei o filme muito bom √≥timo roteiro e excelentes efeitos
"Dec 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Unfortunately, the beautiful visual effects were not enough to make up for the utter lack of substance in the storytelling."
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"I thought it held great production value. The cinematography was beautifully shot. 
I was never board with the story in 
fact I kept anticipating what was happening next.  I can't wait for part 2."
"Dec 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es bien sabido que Zack es odiado por los cr√≠ticos a no mas poder, pero esto es una salvajada, realmente fui bastante exceptivo con esta pel√≠cula por culpa de los cr√≠ticos (en especial de esta pagina pitera) y realmente me sorprendi√≥ para bien este film, es buen√≠sima y Sofia Boutella es incre√≠ble como protagonista.
PD: Una raz√≥n mas, de much√≠simas para no tomar enserio a RT."
"Dec 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Whilst Synder dasels us with his visuals and commendable action sequences, the story is entirely too long and suffers from pacing issues. Also, some of the performances come as a little flat."
"Dec 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Un tr√°iler de mas de dos horas si alma.
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I saw this tonight in London (thanks for the free poster!). I really enjoyed it but it does heavily take influence from other sci-fi. 

This made me want to see the 3 hour cut even more. I suspect that's probably the ""real"" film. 

It's a bit light on action, but it comes together nicely and I think the second part will be the better half."
"Dec 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What a mess! Terrible pacing. I don't know what's worse, if this movie or the horrible star wars shows on disney+."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I absolutely loved this movie. Kai was definitely my favorite character. Can't wait for part 2.
"Dec 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,The score was proficient and at least one of the actors knew their lines.
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Can't understand the low critics score here - way better than last few Star Wars films - characters a bit underdeveloped and can be a bit too overwhelming at times but really 100% solid
"Dec 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Just saw this in London on a 70mm protection. I got the very strong feeling the longer directors cut is going to be a much better film. There's some beautiful sequences in this but it's chopped to bits. A mess. All those gorgeous character stories of Djimon Hounsou and Bae Doona from the trailer just aren't in it at all. The characters suffer for it. It doesn't make sense why they just didn't release the longer cut. Justice League and BVS all over again.
"Dec 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Is Abominal. Visual EFFECTS are perfect but Is Abominal
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"I love all sci-fi, and this is great."
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Wait. You don't have to verify your audience score? No wonder there's thousands of ratings for a movie with limited release. Yikes
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,hotdamn scifi is the best
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Storyline had some familiarities however was a great movie in its own right.
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely fantastic film.
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,It is a very good movie.
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,I'm not sure what movie the critics watched... but the movie I watched is üî•üî•
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Here goes again the UNREALISTIC review of rotten tomatoes critics!
"Dec 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"meh.
Not goodd not terrible.
Meh."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Very violent and intense sci-fi film in the mold of Blade Runner. Outstanding lead performance by Sofia Boutella.
"Dec 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,TRASH! Dont waste your time.
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I don't know what these critics are even talking about. They wouldn't know a good movie if it went across their face.. It's an excellent film and I can't wait to see the second part of it
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Brilliant. One of the greatest scifi epics ever made. Takes a lot from starwars and dune and every 90s fantasy and scifi and mixes it all together to create something that looks familiar but feels fresh! Cant wait for the next one!!
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Action style in this movie is awesome, highly recommended."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"When Star Wars first aired back in the 70s it was panned by critics only to become one of the most loved movie franchises of all time. 

History repeats in Rebel Moon, with artsy fartsy critic lining up on mass to show just how out of of touch they are with the audience.
 
Rebel moon Part one is spectacular space fantasy that creates unique universe and sows the seeds of what can become a spectacular space fantasy series.

The movie pays lashings of homage to fan fiction. If you you are sci-fi geek, you will enjoy this sci-fi franchise."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fantastic movie. Don't no, why so bad ranking"
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie to a new universe. Was it perfect, depends who you ask I guess. I enjoyed it and can't wait for more. RT is unreliable at getting fair reviews. Clearly paid off."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Its not so bad. In fact its a good entertainment
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,No where near as bad as the critics score makes you think. Just feels rushed and unfinished. The 3 hour version will probably be a lot better.
"Dec 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Almost no story, action was okay. You will forget it as soon as you have finished watching it."
"Dec 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Please see this movie for yourself. It‚Äôs shot well the action is good and I want to know what happens next. Of course with all Zack Snyder‚Äôs movies the visual story is stunning!!
"Dec 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Let's say you gave the original Star Wars 9 out of 10. You'd give movie 1 out of 10. Ridiculous plot. Underdevoped characters. And the sin repeated by every action movie in the last five years: A 110 lb female model who can beat up every guy in Cleveland.
"Dec 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,Has some fun moments but bogged down by Snyderisms.
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Got to see this movie again. Absolute masterpiece. Loved it
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning, the world building is intense and fun. I wish we learnt a bit more about each member of the crew though. Ed Skrein stole the show for me! An amazing villain with such a slime and evil presence. It's a must see for Sci-fi fans into the aesthetic of Warhammer and Star Wars."
"Dec 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"this movie is bad, just bad"
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Totally fun! Every thing you would/should want in a sci/fi crazy adventure! The Justice League was formed by the end of the first half, without any of them having super powers. Good time!!"
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good, it's what I was hoping for, I'm looking forward to the next part"
"Dec 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The reason why I didn't give it one star is because it was over two hours, long,! Also, I have a CGI hangover, and am confused why filmmakers think this would bail them out, in place of a good story line! I watched the whole thing, I'm sure, unlike many other people who probably didn't get through the whole two hours plus."
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome! That's all, can't wait for Part Two and the Director's Cuts."
"Dec 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The music was top notch, but the film only started strong for me. The rest of it felt extremely choppy due to pacing issues and I feel only the director's cut can fix that. I'd say watch it if you're interested.

Saw it at TIFF"
"Dec 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The story felt ripped off, this was obviously a rip kid star wars but no one hid that, but the use of slow motion was obscene in this. While it was visually beautiful. It was boring and there was a lot of things that weren't explained. I gave this a shot bc I love Charlie hunnam but this was just a no. And the fact that they justify that they have a directors cut that's much better. Like dude. You shouldn't need a directors cut to be your saving grace. It was understandable for JL bc what happened, but you had basically green flags to do whatever you wanted with this movie. So that's very irritating. People didn't like this movie and you think they're gonna sit through a 5hour version."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was the best movie of 2023. Can't wait for the second part. The Egyptian theatre was perfect for this movie and got packed with people this past Friday, üíØ on my rating. Another master piece!!"
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love this movie! Amazing set, characters, costumes and actors! Lovely design, story and cinematography."
"Dec 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyed the overall story, the worlds are beautiful, characters and costumes all looked great. The action was average, the camera was blurry at times, not sure why, the characters needed more screen time to reveal their motivations for joining Kora. But overall it was an enjoyable experience, I'll be waiting impatiently for part 2."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A space opera made epic, a world building so masive that you can espect anything froms this universe, this part one is an exelent introdution, that shurely will blow up with the second part and the director's cut."
"Dec 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring as hell, prefer to watch star wars than this."
"Dec 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,I can't remember a movie with such a bad story line in it.
"Dec 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Una aut√©ntica patra√±a
"Dec 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Plot was messy, it felt out of order and nothing made sense"
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great Movie, Great Story, and i cannot wait for the sequel."
"Dec 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Maybe it suffered from poor editing since the storyline jumped around too much, making it difficult to follow.

--"
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,I have seen all the movies of the year and this is by far the one I liked the most of all of them.
"Dec 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie was a disappointment, with a disjointed and sloppy plot that seemed like a random assortment of stolen sci-fi tropes.

--"
"Dec 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Promised much, delivered almost nothing, pretty visuals don't equal narrative"
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is an absolute blast. There is so much world-building, with a visual feast. I am excited to see where this story leads."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was lucky to catch a preview screening. I expected to see a copy of Star Wars. But what I saw wasn't Star Wars. It was much bigger. The director created a living world from scratch. We feel its enormity, we meet a multitude of characters, each of whom has their own story and role in this galaxy. This is no longer the sterile and colorful sci-fi that Disney gives us, but a full-fledged cosmic dark fantasy. A production that exceeds the expectations of modern audiences and gives something more.
Visually, musically, acted, narratively... In every respect, Rebel Moon shines and I have no doubt that for many of you it will be the best production of this year, if not the decade. This film simply must be watched.
Maybe during the first viewing you will be a bit overwhelmed by the pace at which the story is presented, but during the second viewing, when you know what this production is about, you will appreciate this film even more. Really, watch this before someone will spoil you this masterpiece ;)"
"Dec 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"good special effects, bad story."
"Dec 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If you like to watch pretty pictures then this is the show for you. If you like substance, good story telling and emotional connections - watch something else. This is yet another show that doesn't know how to write believable female characters as well. I give it one star for the CGI and one star for the effort. Hard pass."
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,So much fun to watch. It was full of cool characters that I can't wait to watch in part 2
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great epic movie! Love the action and drama! Characters have an arc and it has zero super hero weight! Everyone needed each other to fight the Imperium. There's love and hope and bad ass scenes where you feel like Lord of the Rings panoramic sequence, with a sci-fi fantasy feel to it. Love the vast array of characters with lots of great dialogue!!"
"Dec 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The visuals are amazing, but the plot is not something new, about gathering rebels, fighting the empire, betrayal, greed, etc. and some have commented without being objective, they have shown their hatred for a person (Gunn)"
"Dec 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"P√©sima nada encaja, son mil historias sueltas solo √∫tiles para dormir"
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Espectacular la magia de zack es imparable.  Es una pel√≠cula no apta para sensibles y malos criticones.  100 puntos para esta obra de arte!!
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie with amazing visuals and original ideas.
"Dec 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Abysmal. Disjointed and sloppy. Feels like a patchwork of stolen scifi tropes thrown together. Action sequences were lackluster. This is nothing special. The audience score will settle somewhere in the 60s when all is said and done.
"Dec 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bonito, por√©m extremamente gen√©rico, raso e sem enredo suficiente para justificar a pr√≥pria exist√™ncia"
"Dec 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Rebel Moon es simplemente Zack¬°¬°¬°. De la misma manera que unos lo odian sin ver sus peliculas o buscando el mas minimo error, otros lo adoramos por seguir su vision y sus instintos, por hacernos sentir el cine como pocos y eso lo hace merecedor de nuestra confianza y respeto."
"Dec 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Esta mamada no es cine.
"Dec 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The film has amazing visual !! 

Excellent characters, gorgeous stunt sequences.

but storytelling is difficult to say it is the best, we have to prepare for the director's cut."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Such a good movie, you can always tell if it's going to be good based off RT. If they score it low, it will probably be good. Too much hate for Zac."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Zach Snyder's Star Wars, (coughs) I mean Rebel Moon, this is a good sci-fi film, it's got elements of genre blending, elements of a Viking/ Norse epic, a Western, Seven Samurai, the Magnificent Seven, and Zacks version of Star Wars. This isn't the same thing as Star Wars it has a different vibe. It is a quality Sci-fi film with a good mature story, it has an epic score. Two times I could picture Darth Vader coming into the next scene based upon the audio design. The visuals are great. The story is great. I took a road trip to the Bay Theater to see this in theaters and I'm glad I did. I really liked it. I want to see the R rated version. It feels like some important elements of the story could be expanded upon. There are hints that a sex scene may have been cut. Overall, I like the tone, the visual style and the audio design. I wish it was available in a larger theater. The small theater / screen didn't show it in the size and scale I would have preferred to see. This needs to be shown on the larger screens to a mass audience. This is a solid franchise starter. It's a quality movie. I wish it was available in more theaters and on larger screens as it deserves. This should have been a wider release. I am glad I took the road trip to see it in theaters. I can wait to see the full R rated version of the film."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Just saw it at tiff and man what a cliffhanger! Part 2 can't come soon enough.
"Dec 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Its a shame as I wanted Synder to knock it out of the park. But its a mess. While the visuals are striking, the story telling lacks much to be desired."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Zack never misses can't wait for part 2
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very good, excellent start to the franchise."
"Dec 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Ahsoka le gana, zzz con rebel moon"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Just saw it at the paris theater in Manhattan .Stunning visuals cant wait for part 2
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"To the RT Cr!t!cs, your taste $uck$, maybe because you have been tasting each others'. You need to get checked up. Start from Pr0ct0logists. Looks like something is stuck up."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"A m√≠ en particular me ha gustado mucho, espero que se haga la segunda parte, no entiendo algunas cr√≠ticas. Cuando ves algo de Zack ya sabes lo que ves, no puedes esperar que sea El padrino."
"Dec 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Lamentablemente esta no es la pelicular que va a revivir la carrera del director, totalmente carente de originalidad busca ser un evento masivo como lo fueron las obras a las cuales intenta imitar de manera torpe y poco interesante, es un Frankenstein que no logra encontrar su propia esencia y lo poco rescatable son sus efectos especiales, por momento da tomas hermosas que acaban asfixiadas entre un mal guion y una primicia hueca."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was everything i wanted it to be. From the visuals, to the performances and the score, this film is a just a small drop of water in a vast ocean. It leaves you wanting more of this fantastical new universe. Can't wait for the extended cut and it's Continuation in the spring."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great visuals and a lot of heart. The characters have depth. The movie is over two hours but the movie is fast pace. A must see for sci fi fans
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"If you like movies aside Marvel, Disney and Co. you might like RM and its stunnig visuals."
"Dec 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Was really looking forward to this but it just fell a bit meh ü´§ Maybe the second film will make it feel more complete
"Dec 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I fell sleep in the fist 30 min, beeter go and watch star wars not a copy"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"What an epic and fun movie ! Beautiful shots, fresh faces , unique universe , stunning fight scenes,‚Ä¶ I had a blast watching it and can't wait for part 2 !"
"Dec 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I expected nothing but visuals, and was somehow still disappointed."
"Dec 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Fue tan aburrida que honestamente me qued√© dormido en el primer acto. Las secuencias de acci√≥n horriblemente ejecutadas, el gui√≥n muy forzado y p√©sima direcci√≥n. Al finalizar la pel√≠cula la sientes vac√≠a."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"So fun, epic and masterful! It has all of Snyders style and creativity and is just so enjoyable to experience . Can't wait for Part 2!"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Rebel Moon is a fun wild ride and an exceptional sci-fi fantasy movie. I just wish this were the R-Rated version because I feel there is so much movie to be told. I can't wait for Part 2 to be released.
"Dec 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,So pretty and so dumb.
"Dec 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ahsoka le gana zzzzz
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great visual effects, and a story that opens the door to an even bigger universe in fiction, I definitely recommend it"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"√âpico, emocional y fant√°stico, una de las mejores pel√≠culas de ciencia ficci√≥n"
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Greatest movie of all time must watch incredible mind blowing best of the best
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Great exciting movie and can't wait for the second part. Saw it in the limit theater release and will be watching again over the holidays
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"We need more original movies like this, love the world building. Writing is ok, hopefully better on next installment"
"Dec 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A visual masterpiece, a narrative snoozefest."
"Dec 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Great visuals with writing that makes Rise of Skywalker look like The Godfather.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Another masterpiece! Great cast great story can't wait for the sequel
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Was lucky enough to see it in theaters. loved every minute of it! bring on part 2!
"Dec 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I adore Sofia Boutella and that's a good thing because she is in this movie. And I honestly think she did as much as she could to save the movie, but you can't do anything with no writing and no story. And of course all the other stuff people have talked about, being derivative etc. I love you Sofia but it's a bad movie."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"What some people don't seem to understand is that this isn't one of the Star Wars movies,just understand that it's set in the Armyverse,the same universe as Army of the Dead and Army of Thieves that came out in 2021."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Zack tiene un toque √∫nico ..! todo un visionario
"Dec 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Girl boss movie again and again and again and again and again . .................
"Dec 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's as if the creative minds behind it decided to combine the artistic prowess of a snail with the audacity of a cardboard box. Yes, my friend, you heard me right. The bar for originality was set so low that it could practically be used as a limbo stick by a toddler. Those characters, oh boy, they were about as memorable as a forgotten tweet in a sea of mundane social media posts. I mean, seriously, they failed to leave even the faintest imprint on the viewers consciousness. It's astounding how something so lackluster managed to find its way onto the screen. We deserve depth, complexity, and narratives that leave us in awe, not just a shiny facade that crumbles upon closer inspection."
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Buena pel√≠cula, no le gusta a la cr√≠tica, garant√≠a de gran pel√≠cula"
"Dec 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Makes the Phantom Menace look like a cinematic masterpiece
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,One of my favorites shoots all of time movie!.
"Dec 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Visually stunning great story
"Dec 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Hard to watch. Looked good but lacked any depth. Too much slow mo.
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Vaya cosa tan lamentable, Venom parece El Padrino en comparaci√≥n. Este director se cree que solo por ser oscuro su historia es adulta, a pesar, de que el gui√≥n est√© totalmente descuidado."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I was dragged to this movie by my friends to watch in 70mm
I came out in love with this new world they built in this movie, epic visuals , really fast pace but overall epic movie."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a Masterpiece! Visually stunning, action-packed, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. 

This is Star Wars on steroids!!!!

I'd give this 8/10. And put it in the Top 5 of best movies of 2023!"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,FLAWLESS MOVIE!! ü§Øüî•üî•üî•
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This is just objectively bad. 
The tired slo-mo actions notwithstanding, the highly derivative plot drags and the characters are mostly shallow, under-developed archetypes you'd more expect from a bored teenager in class rather than an experienced filmmaker. There's a reason why this never became part of the Star Wars franchise and this is the same reason you should give Rebel Moon a hard pass."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"The critics' reviews Stink fishy! 
In any case, critics' reviews have never been as significant as audience reviews!"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,It is a whole new universe! Very magical and cinematic with lots of homages to classics! Can't wait for the extended R version but this was so enjoyable and a great setup for part 2. Watch it!
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is epic, big scale , bug character lore, awesome world building, out of the world VFX and cinematography.
Can't wait for Part 2"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was visually stunning, action-packed, great acting, score, etc. Only thing was that I had some favorite characters in here that didn't have enough screentime in this 2hr cut. Definitely need that extra hour of the director's cut that's to flesh out their narratives too, so can't wait for that!"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Watched this movie with my friends at 70mm screening without any knowledge of what it is about and this movie surprised me,
The visuals, the character lore, score all top notch, it was really fast paced but I found out they will release longer R rated version soon.

Definitely recommend this movie to everyone who wants to watch big scale space opera with mindblowing visuals and new story."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was Excellent!!!!
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a great movie! Can‚Äôt wait for the directors cut! 
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is pure Cinema. 
I encourage people to see it in theaters if and when they can."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Couldn't ask more for a new starting space opera!
Loved it! beautiful visual, great story, probably too complex for some people, but don't let that fool you!"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie was amazing. I can't wait for the R-Rated version. You can definitely tell more of the story's world building arc was left on the cutting room floor, but I can't wait to enjoy more of this world. Sofia Boutella is an action movie star."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is beautiful, story is solid but lack character arc or development but that will be fixed in longer cut that has 1 hour of extra footage.

Sofia really shined as lead, all characters look important for the story and contribute to the plot, minor pacing issues will be fixed in the longer cut later.
Overall really impressed with this movie even though I have watched star wars but this looked fresh and different. I can't wait for Longer R rated Director's Cut and not to forget Part 2."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Epic.. Can't wait for part 2 , bring it on"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"A Fantastic  Movie , Epic Scale and Mythology . A Movie which is not necessarily made for critics to enjoy but for us the fans who appreciate the work and effort done  , zack is an amazing director and amazing person and his work is really enjoyable and appreciated by his fans who value his unique art ."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"The first part of Rebel Moon is great & it can still be improved, I have faith that Zack will give us more movies like this. He doesn't deserve that bad score that the supposed film critics gave him"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Its nice.. its good.. its can be more good
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Perhaps it was badly edited? It jumped around so much and I didn't care about the characters. Can't knock the ambition though
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the better movies of the year. Great story and visuals. Need to see the second one ASAP
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"If we are talking of cinema 
This is it
Pure in its perfection"
"Dec 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,No one has watched this movie yet. Don't believe this score
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really enjoyed it, yes, it was a very very fast-paced story, but it was very enjoyable; sound effects were awesome and the cast was great. 
The visuals and action was superb as usual. 
Thank you ZACK."
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Meh. Visually stunning, but otherwise there really wasn't anything special about this, it didn't click with me emotionally at all. Sucks that the ratings are gonna be full of hardcore synder fanboys trying to make a point by spamming good reviews and people that are gonna review bomb it because they don't like the guy. It's a shame, usually Zack Synder hits it out of the park with epics that have a large cast, like his cut of Justice League, 300, and Watchmen. Better than Army of the Dead though, and maybe Part 2 will save it."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow..this is such a epic movie, visually a masterpiece..can't wait for part 2 ü§©"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was worth the wait.
Snyder as always bringing visually stunning films"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Me encanta el trailer, definitivamente ser√° un √©xito. Necesitamos salir del encajonamiento de Star War y Star Trek cuando se trata de ciencia ficci√≥n."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved this movie. Visual stunning great movie. Love the mythology. Action and science fiction marvel...... waiting for more with anticipation
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"An epic sci fi universe in the making, is off to a strong start with the part 1 of rebel moon. While I cant wait for the director's cut it was an absolute delight and an incredible watch. Highly recommend this for anyone that loves the sci fi western diesel punk esque genre."
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A terrible movie, with a notable lack of character development and boring moments"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolute cinema, had a great time with it."
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Derivative as it is beautiful, Rebel Moon is an amalgamation of the worst tropes in sci-fi. This would have fared better if it didn't so desperately want to be a launching pad for ""the best new Sci-Fi IP"". One of Snyder's worst."
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A este punto ya la mayor√≠a ha visto o sabe de los 7 Samurai o los 7 magn√≠ficos. Esta pel√≠cula no aporta nada nuevo y es solo un refrito en temas. Lo √∫nico rescatable es la habilidad visual del director y el cinemat√≥grafo. Pero solo es eso, la pel√≠cula ""Se ve bien"" est√©ticamente y punto"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,It is an epic space epic from one of the filmmakers who best shoots action scenes in the history of cinema.  Highly recommended
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"El inicio de una saga que ser√° una alternativa al universo de Starwars. Obvio tiene similitudes pues es una historia que se creo con la idea de ser un spin-off pero que busca su propia identidad. 
No esperen encontrar chistes o escenas a modo de un cine ligero que algunos ""cr√≠ticos"" asumen que deben existir en toda pel√≠cula para ser entretenida."
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Please stop Zack. Just stop 
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely loved it!

I loved the characters and tone. It's really sincere, and got me thoroughly engaged.

Can't wait to see the longer cut too, then Part Two!"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Good movie. See it for yourself.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Excelente pel√≠cula. Sin dudas, lo mejor del 2023 en cuanto a √©pica y ciencia ficci√≥n."
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Pel√≠cula vac√≠a...Solo es un conjunto PAT√âTICO de escenas de acci√≥n con un nulo desarrollo en la historia.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Great film. A masterpiece
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,I've never made an rotten tomatoes account but this movie is so painfully bad I had to. All the Zach fan boys love this because flashy lights with a bad filter over it will get dumb people to give 5 starts to anything. Please for the love of God stop letting Zach into the studio
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,A visual spectacle as expected that manages to combine it's influences (Kurosawa &  Lucas primarily) into a stew that feels old but tastes new. Very curious to see where it goes. Should've just released the full version though as it leaves you wanting more (and not just in the ways that it should)
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"IT'S AMAZING. 9/10 
THE MUSIC, THE VISUALS, EVERYTHING IS JUST AMAZING. CRITICS GOT IT ALL WRONG."
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Most of the critics are spot on - so unbelievably boring. It feels like a two hour trailer, just a collection of different scenes that don't flow from one to the next, without a single interesting character or story beat in sight.  The Star Wars references are a little too on the nose, but that would be fine if you even cared 10% about the characters or the world.

The main villain was pretty decent though. The only time I was somewhat interested is when he was on screen."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not really a fan of scifi but this was actually alot of fun. My favourite character would have to be admiral atticus noble the ""villian"". Ed skrein plays him so well you start to hate him lol. I heard there will be r rated directors cut so really looking forward to those too."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Twitter gonna say it aint good lol fake movie fans don't know anything lol this movie is great!!!
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another Awesome movie, everyone should watch, wowww visuals. Waiting for part 2 the The Scargiver"
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Puro efecto especial, lo dem√°s sin alma."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Seven samurai in space. Zack never disappoint. Action...Great. Cinematography...Great. Story wise...good. Pacing...great.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was fun, intense and emotional. It's a fantastic way to spend a couple of hours and get lost in the lore and story. Idk what those critics are seeing but this is a good movie"
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I really don't understand why you wouldn't just put out the directors cut as the first option to watch the movie, I doubt it would solve all the problems with the movie but it would at least flesh out the story and characters a little more."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,It's an amazing act.. clean Visual and GC. Deep character and plot. Looking forward for part 2..
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Fabulosa pel√≠cula üëèüëè!!!
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is Visually Stunning as is most of hIS work, the Acting superb.  All in all best movie of the year. The ""Critics"" on here have been paid by WBD to bomb this movie which you will see once you watch the movie for yourself. 5 Stars! üåü"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I watched it last night, and I loved it!"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Zack did again! Awesome!
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie.. Absolute feast for SciFi fans. Can't wait for Part 2. Thanks.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This film is suitable if you are a fan of the genre of fiction, monsters, technology, war, and mythological stories or robot warfare.. a good work"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Visually stunning & enjoyable film
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely PHENOMENAL film! It ingeniously lays the groundwork for diverse themes and characters, featuring a multi-racial cast. It brilliantly showcases stunning effects, introducing us to a vibrant, expansive universe with limitless potential. I'm eager to rewatch, dive into the game, delve into the comics, and explore everything Rebel Moon has in store for the future!"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I really liked it, it's actually so good and the script is smart, can't wait for the next one."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"this felt like a story, with meaning and intention, characters are cool too, Djimon is bad A double snakes. Very cool, looking forward to the extended cut. ZS is king."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"nice action,epic fighting,the casting is on point,sophie is awesome.bestter than today blockbuster movies.Absolute must see.9/10.cant wait for 3 hours cut."
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Terrible, rushed and incoherent, decent visuals though."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Everything about this movie was great. I can't wait for part two.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"THE BEST SCIENCE FILM OF THE LAST 20 YEARS, I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Es una muy buena pel√≠cula de ""ciencia ficci√≥n"", Excelente fotograf√≠a, Unas im√°genes visuales que no tienen nada que envidiar, sino todo lo contrario sorprende, adem√°s que, Necesit√°bamos algo que le haga una contra parte al ya extinto universo de Star wars."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Yet another example of why critics opinions don't matter and they never have. The movie looks and sounds amazing a true work of art yet again from synder if this was a one and done; then I would be furious with how this movies ends. It left me wanting more and in April we get more. Synder has created something original and it's truly epic. Don't listen to critics judge for yourself, they self proclaimed importance should never effect who watches or enjoys a movie."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Criticisms are valid, felt like the dialogue was a little clunky and exposition heavy at times, but memorable story, great action, and beautiful visuals. Looking forward to the director's cut and part two"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,I was worried it wasn't gonna feel original but i love the world building. Can't wait for part 2
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"For me it's a masterpiece, I'm also a Star Wars fan, but Rebel Moon is simply beautiful and a visual delight. Unfortunately, as always, there are haters who try to change the mood, but in the end, only the streaming numbers count and they will be very high! I'm looking forward to part 2 Give 10 out of 10 points"
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I wanted this to be the next big thing. Unfortunately, it fails on every level. Zack needs to take a time out and stop pandering to his audience. He's got the potential to be great!"
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If this is Zack's attempt to create a star wars copy well he failed woefully. Rebel moon has once again shown and prove every problem with Zack's films, THE PLOT, the plot is the key and Zack with his years of experience still hasn't figured that out yet. Well his casual fans are gonna love it, at least."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good cast, beautiful visuals, an enjoyable movie."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"√ìtimo filme, fren√©tico do come√ßo ao fim"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie . Can't believe all the negative reviews . Now people can't even watch a movie based on a review because of review bombing and biasness. ..
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie . ZS did his thing here.  We know the Professional critics are bought and paid for . You should watch this movie if you are into syfy type stuff for sure.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"An absolute gem! Zack as always, took the risk and establish a sci fi universe worth investing in, and something to be celebrated by all sci fi lovers out there."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow, that's really an interesting movie and universe"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Was waiting for this movie.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing. From start to finish. Fresh new take on Sci-Fi themes, followed by Zack's amazing visuals and slo mos. Lot of lore to get into and discover. A must seeüôåüèΩ"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Rebel Moon is unique and exquisite. From the Stars and Beyond is flawless in every characteristic of storytelling. Part one is a dose of excitement adventure and emotions. remarkable visual perfection. A heavenly inspiration of imagination.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,The best Star Wars movie that was never maid.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Had the privilege to attend the screening of this film. Ain't a big fan of Zack's work especially Army Of the Dead and BVS. But Rebel Moon...holy moly. Reminded me of 300. Although there's some parts that definitely feel like they were cut for the runtime the story is really profound with lovable characters. Go for it!!
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,The worst copy that i've ever seen of star wars
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Es la mejor pel√≠cula ciencia y ficci√≥n de guerras en el espacio
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is exactly how you make movies!
Everything is executed so well even if it's not the R-Rated director's cut. Acting, scores, cinematography. This is top tier filmmaking. This is how great movie looks like.
Can't wait to see part 2 and both of the R-Rated director's cut."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Is a great movie, a new universe is starting"
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Literally one of the most boring movies I've seen, it has extremely confusing plots, stories, scenes and strange character settings. There is almost nothing outstanding about this movie except for the VFX..."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's an epic space adventure with a captivating storyline. The characters are well-developed, and the visuals are truly out of this world. It's a must-watch!"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"The emotions, the threat of the oppressive government, the price of freedom, this movie is so truthful, the message is so clear. Besides that, the director's really knew how to create a world building and execute the film. Thanks for anyone involved in the making of this film. This film is diamond."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Una de las mejores pel√≠culas del a√±o, secuencias de acci√≥n alucinantes, una banda sonora impecable y cna actuaciones destacables."
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,I saw it and low key mid I thought this was going to be good very disappointing
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is the kind of movie we need! This is when the director given the freedom to express and spread the message for the world. It has clear messages for all of us, the acting is absolutely incredible, the score is grandeur, the story is just the tip of the iceberg but it delivers so much lore already. Amazing"
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Totally garbage. Lack of heart and humar, Unnecessary slow-mo's, very bad story telling. There are to many plot wholes. Only stunning visuals dont make a movie good enough."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing amd rollercoaster scifi, with great CGI and part 1 build with action sequences, and the slowmo is crispy :)"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,this is something I will call a perfect Christmas movie.
"Dec 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great visuals, score, and a good start to an expanding universe."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I seen this at the London BFI IMAX at the premiere. I largely enjoyed this movie. It was filled with great action scenes, diverse characters, great world building and when you peel away the skin there is a huge universe to dissect in terms of themes and mythology.

There are going to be two cuts of this movie, one is a more family oriented movie and the longer cut in Zack's words is crazy and brutal. But even the family friendly version has several mature themes in it than the run of the mill marvel movie for example, it respects what it is and doesn't hold back.

The performances by every actor is top notch, the visuals and music is amazing and the set pieces are wonderful.

I've rated this ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"very good, promises a lot"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Don‚Äôt listen to the critics, they are shilling for Disney. The film is an arthouse blockbuster for the ages. This is what it must have felt like seeing Star Wars back in 1977. Grateful to have seen it at The Paris Theater in NYC!"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Great scifi epic with great action and characters.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is fu*king awesome!!!
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Snyders visual effects and storytelling once again show why he's a master at this craft!

Fierce action

"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good action , good visuals , good characterers"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,One of the greatest space fantasy movie ever ...loved it
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie! Compelling storytelling, great effects. Can't wait to see the Director's cut and Part 2! It doesn't deserve the negative reviews I have seen."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Visually fantastic, excellent story, very fresh.

finally some serious science fiction
Jimmy with Anthony Hopkins was some of the best."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie, great visuals. Can't wait for the extended cut and part 2."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Epic story, visually storytelling, and a cast of characters that mesh well and can carry their own. A must see for the year."
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Space balls is better 
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Starts decent but the second part of the movie is awful
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Watched the movie during London premiere & absolutely fell in love with the whole new universe. Although I'd have preferred a 3 hr R rated cut which would delve more into the characters backstory, this PG13 version stands on its own. Can't wait for the Part 2 Scargiver."
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Occasionally looks good but the story is not enjoyable.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"So much fun and so much to unpack. Time flew by! The visuals, score, and story are epic. Sofia nails it."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I didn't have a high expectations going in to this movie specially after I saw the so called ""critics"" review but I was blown away on how good this movie was. It's unique and pure art. I recommend everyone to go watch it and judge for themselves. Its 9.5/10 for me"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Awesome! spectacular!
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Imperdible, aire fresco, escenas que te dejan con la boca abierta, necesitamos m√°s franquicias nuevas como esta."
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Like most of his productions, it's just bad storytelling that is pretty. Style over substance should be his tagline."
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,como siempre a esperar el corte del director para tener un minimo de calidad (spoiler: no la tendra)
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Must watch movie! Just watch it and see for yourself.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Great film. I throughly enjoyed it.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Great original story - Disney f-ed up passing on this as a Star Wars series!
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow. Much Much better than tha new star wars movies or Zack last movie i.e. Army of dead .
Can't believe the review bombing to another Zack movie by the critics. How these critics are even reliable. RT should ban those biased critics . They are not at all reliable .."
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Es terrible y eso es quedarse cortos. Ni aunque spameen 10s sin parar eso quitar√° la mala calidad de la pel√≠cula de un director que no deber√≠a existir.
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Encuentro un desprop√≥sito con Rebel Moon; uno que malentiende el lenguaje del cine y busca a toda costa impresionar por una idiosincracia tan √±o√±a y b√°sica. Aburre de sobremanera, pero lastima la vista a√∫n m√°s."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I have never seen a movie with such a cool visual experience before, and Rebel Moon achieved it. Perhaps the fully realized version will be the R-rated director's cut, which is set to be released next year, but it doesn't diminish my love for it."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Is one of the best movies about war in the space
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Mucha c√°mara lenta , eso si es visualmente hermosa, pero en  lo m√°s importante  se equivocaron la historia es aburrida."
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Un desastre de proporciones √©picas. Puro Slow Motion y grandilocuencia para una historia derivativa y sin inspiraci√≥n
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Un desastre sin fondo, maximalista y mal hecha. Me r√≠o de esta pelicula"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Finally someone is attempting to at least try something new within the genre! It may not be a perfect movie but one can have fun with this one! A must see.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"""Rebel Moon"" is a must-watch for anyone seeking a cinematic masterpiece that combines an engaging story, superb performances and breathtaking visuals. It's a feel-good movie that will leave you with a smile on your face and a hunger for ""Rebel Moon Part 2: The Scargiver"". Don't miss the opportunity to experience the magic of ""Rebel Moon"" for yourself - you won't be disappointed.

Tokyo Premiere Dec 11th."
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,good special effects with a bad and soulless story
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Watched the movie in the Japanese premier. Loved the characters, theme, action and the score . Would have liked to have spend more time with some of the characters especially blood axe and jimmy! Can't wait for part 2!"
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Woof... Absolute garbage and mess of a film. Kora is a terrible actress. Half the movie is shot in slow motion. The finale is dull. The twist fell flat and predictable. Seriously, you allow a whole cantina to hear you want to go against the imperials and immediately trust the first person to tell you they have a ship? Fucking stupid... And you take out a whole platoon of guys meant to keep your village in line... Do they not ever need to check in? No one is getting updates from them? Also, who the fuck cares about the slain king's daughter. That background story really went nowhere fast"
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Waiting for the visionary's story telling and Easter eggs.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great film, good entertainment, great visual effects and soundtrack, unlike so many other films that debuted on streaming and in theaters, this one fulfilled its role with a simple and well-executed story with many visual similarities to Star Wars."
"Dec 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,This was a good ass movie but there's some problems with it. Other than that I enjoyed the film.
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is a huge chance to start a new universe.. with strong storytelling.. I loved the slow motion and all characters.. im so excited for part 2 .. give this universe a chance
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"For me, Rebel Moon is a 10/10. The cinematography, the soundtrack, the characters, everything I liked and I can't wait to watch the R-rated version."
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolutely amazing visually and a great first half overall.  Can't wait to see part 2!
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,FINALLY got to see it! Disney you had something golden and you let it slip! WOnderful movie has a huge heart and amazing set pieces! ONly downside is they should have released the DC at once. But I will def revisit the directors cut of Rebel Moon Part 1! What an amzing early christmas present!
"Dec 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"I don't understand why Rotten Tomatoes is rating Rebel Moon so low,,, the movie is a lot better than movies they've scored higher..it clearly shows there's hidden interests in most of the critics..."

"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Absolute Must See!  Zack never disappoints
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Incroyable premi√®re partie pour cette nouvelle Saga !
"Dec 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Unwatchable..
Terrible and hyper derivative..
Why not just film Robert Heinlein or Arthur C. Clark classics instead.
A waste of your time..
This might work if it had any wit or insight..
It doesn't.."
"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,The Movie was Absolutely Great so I my rate is the Highest %.
"Dec 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Despite only focusing on a couple main characters and leaving the others in the background, rebel moon succeeds in action, works building, design and creativity. With the announcement of the 3 hour directors cut coming next year, it's safe to bet the pacing issues and characters will be more fleshed out. As it is, it's an entertaining first entry into a fantastic fantasy world"

"Dec 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Rebel Moon a story that tells a tale of a former soldier known as kora that ran off from tyrannical empire to live peacefully at a small moon called veldt until admiral atticus noble lands on the planet and the quest to find rebels that willing to join them to save the whole universe.

What do i think of rebel moon ? 

The film itself ranging from visuals spectacle to its world building it was phenomenal. Zack knows what he's doing from the ground up personally for me it's already ten times better than star wars content for the past 20 years. This should be watch on the biggest screen and on imax for sure how good the visuals is. And for the story and characters all set well and done. Every character is a definite show stealer especially Kora and Kai both of them are badassess. The side characters also did and serve their purpose to the story while i have small gripes i would say that the story should be more fleshed out and they could just add up around 20 minutes more to the film so that it can breathe and seen more characters clild shine throughout. 

All and all Rebel moon is by far one of the best action films in 2023. Don't forget to check it out."
