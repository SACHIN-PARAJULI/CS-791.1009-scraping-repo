Me: well not everyone in the family is perfect and it dose start a bit slow with a unlikable fatherü´§+üòº. Though once we get to the 2nd half of the movie that's when the best part's finally reach there full potential ü§©

"Nov 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,Years to late. Very outdated.
"Oct 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's about everything you expect it to be. Take every trope from the first three and somehow make it feel worse. Only redeeming quality is the funny child acting and lines that can be taken out of context. This is not good, but in all fairness, 7 year old me probably would've loved it. It's still a not good."
"Oct 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I understand Too much people hated it Because the Message it's Overused and Overrated, Because, Excepting some Movie, games or series, This Message it's Useless for Almost Everything"
"Oct 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Quite honestly this movie was terrible with terrible writing and terrible rehashing of projects that are ten times better than it
"Oct 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Quase ningu√©m gostou desse filme, mais na minha opini√£o esse filme √© maravilhoso!!! Muita a√ß√£o, aventura e com√©dia, esse filme √© muito fam√≠lia, ent√£o assista agora e pare de criticar!!!"
"Oct 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was poopoo pipi, it sounds like it was written by a dollar store version of a lobotomized chat gpt. The plot was so bad I almost cried of laughter. I've seen the original movies and this one genuinely seems like a joke made of the original 4. The cgi looks like it was made in 1546, the message was so boring and just not true, you can't solve everything with kindness and being nice and honest to everyone, and the fact that all the villains and the OSS guy went along with it is baffling to me. The fact that the children are repeatedly seeing examples of why they should cheat and use tricks and not kindness and honesty, the world is gonna end in 8 minutes and they're trying to have a fair fight. The parents are so ignorant it amazes me, they have the world's strongest hacking device and they keep it in their home, which has a security so lax
 it can be stolen through hacking the game their kids are playing on their console, their parents also display a significant lack of skill considering their role as super spies and the kids are too good at everything they do. they took a movie series we all enjoyed as children and turned it into an absolute joke of a movie, there are so many solutions to their problem, so many plot holes, and so much stupidity it's crazy. I don't think I've ever seen a movie this laughably bad."
"Oct 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No es como las primeras 3 es muy aburrida en comparaci√≥n y la ni√±a siempre que dice algo tiene la raz√≥n y solo pata dar un mensaje muuuuuuy forzado de que solo con verdades se gana y que no deben existir los esp√≠as porque espiar esta mal y literalmente se contradice en todo esta pel√≠cula es mil veces peor que la cuarta el chiste de un esp√≠a es ser deshonesto y que el mundo se ""infecte"" con un videojuego me parece absurdo si la tercera era algo parecido pero por lo menos esa era entrenida pero esta solo es"" esque la sinceridad es todo en la vida y que si eres deshonesto no conseguir√°s nada"" pesima a mi opini√≥n"
"Oct 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"didn't even know or expect a sequel to the spy kids franchise. honestly, even though it was made with current technology, it doesn't hold a candle to spy kids 3d in terms of the plot. seems like they used most of their budget on the house and casting the cast"
"Oct 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Wow! Spy Kids: Armageddon is an action-packed, family-friendly adventure that takes the beloved Spy Kids franchise to new heights. Directed by the visionary Robert Rodriguez, this film combines thrilling spy missions with heartwarming family moments, making it a fantastic addition to the series.

The film follows the next generation of Spy Kids, Nora Torrez (Gina Rodriguez) and Terrance Tango (Zachary Levi)'s children, tasked to save the world from a diabolical villain's doomsday device. The young cast, led by talented newcomers Connor Esterson and Everly Carganilla, brings fresh energy to the franchise. The action sequences are exhilarating, and the gadgets are as ingenious as ever, providing a visual spectacle that left me on the edge of my seat.

Spy Kids: Armageddon excels in production elements. The imaginative sets, cleverly designed spy gadgets, and visually stunning special effects create a world that feels familiar and full of surprises. Standout performances by Everly Carganilla as Patty Tango-Torrez and Connor Esterson as Tony Tango-Torrez add depth to the cast, and their chemistry with the lead characters is delightful. Rodriguez's signature style shines through in the film's direction, keeping the pace engaging and fully immersing the audience in the Spy Kids universe.

At its core, Spy Kids: Armageddon delivers a positive message about teamwork, family and believing in oneself. The young spies face challenges and make mistakes, but ultimately learn and grow from their experiences.

I give Spy Kids: Armageddon 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 12, plus adults who have fond memories of the original Spy Kids movies. You can catch this exciting family adventure right now on Netflix, making it a perfect choice for a cozy movie night at home with your little spies-in-training. By Hanadie K., KIDS FIRST!"
"Oct 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Hearing about Spy Kids releasing a new movie I was so excited to see how the story would progress, plus Spy Kids were my childhood movies growing up! But watching the new Armageddon movie I just noticed that literally it's the same concept as the first movie, just with different actors and better graphics for the new generation.

If anything the movie was more confusing and dumb with the whole video game idea, it was also pretty long and everything just had a turn that would make the story longer and longer. In addition the fact that the children made the world better with only the harmless and kind ways gives kids the thought that that's how the world works, but the more grown up we get the more stupid and honestly kind of frustrating this idea is.
By all mean this movie isn't a total bad kids movie, it does teach in some ways i guess, but it definitely is probably the worst out of the entire Spy Kids series which for me is disappointing. Sorry movie lovers had to give my opinion."
"Oct 9, 2023",POSITIVE,Great fun for the kids!  Modern special effects are amazing and will please the youngsters who might be unimpressed when their parents  screen the first of the franchise.
"Oct 8, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was good but could've been better though
"Oct 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Stinkeroo compared to the earlier Spy Kids movies.  A case of trying to reinvent a franchise and coming up with a ""Made for TV After School Movie"" in quality and lack of script."
"Oct 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"La franquicia creada por Robert Rodr√≠guez es reiniciada en esta quinta pel√≠cula, presentando un nuevo rumbo con algunos elementos que recuerdan a las pel√≠culas anteriores. A pesar de que las pel√≠culas de Spy Kids siempre estuvieron destinadas a un p√∫blico infantil, la verdad es que a medida que la franquicia avanzada, se infantilizaba cada vez m√°s. Esta pel√≠cula se la podr√≠a considerar m√°s infantil que las anteriores por varios motivos. El argumento es una loca combinaci√≥n entre la trama de la primera pel√≠cula y el concepto de la tercera. Se vuelve muy fantasiosa con el concepto de un videojuego tomando control del mundo real y recurriendo a lo virtual para adaptarla a un tiempo donde los gamers y la realidad virtual se volvieron parte de nuestra vida. Hay todo un festival de CGI que la vuelve una pel√≠cula visualmente llamativa y alocada. Los nuevos personajes no est√°n para nada a la altura de los personajes de las pel√≠culas anteriores, ni siquiera logran ganarle a la familia Cortez. Los dos hermanitos se quedan cortos en comparaci√≥n con Carmen y Juni, aunque al menos logran tener algo de simpat√≠a. Patty es una ni√±a con una ternura realmente irresistible y talvez sea lo mejor de la pel√≠cula, pero eso cambia cuando llega un punto en que Patty se siente demasiado buena y la pel√≠cula termina d√°ndole demasiada relevancia. Las pel√≠culas infantiles de Robert Rodr√≠guez son pocas, pero una caracter√≠stica especial de ellas es que tienen una moraleja. La franquicia de Spy Kids siempre se caracteriz√≥ por tener un mensaje sobre el valor de la familia. Esta quinta pel√≠cula posee algo de eso, pero rompe ese elemento importante cuando Patty demuestra tener demasiada raz√≥n con respeto a la bondad y la sinceridad. Esta pel√≠cula tiene una moraleja que se basa en la importancia de la sinceridad. Por momentos lo hace bien, por otros lo hace como si fuera algo sacado de Steven Universe y hace que tanto la pel√≠cula como Patty pierdan credibilidad. Robert Rodr√≠guez suele basar sus pel√≠culas infantiles en el lazo que tiene con sus hijos y ellos suelen ser la fuente de todas las fantas√≠as proyectadas en las pel√≠culas. Pero se puede notar que en cada pel√≠cula hay una tonalidad distinta en como va narrando sus historias infantiles. Las primeras tres entregas de Spy Kids se pod√≠an tomar un poco m√°s en serio y ten√≠an un buen balance al contar algo que los ni√±os y sus padres pudieran disfrutar al mismo tiempo. Incluso The Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl pose√≠a tambi√©n ese balance. Pero desde Shorts hasta Spy Kids 4 y ahora esta pel√≠cula se perdi√≥ ese balance y se volvieron algo que parece hecho por un ni√±o al cien por ciento. Esta pel√≠cula cae en eso y se vuelve algo que solo los ni√±os pueden admirar mientras los padres probablemente no la vayan a ver del mismo modo. Spy Kids: Armageddon es un reinicio algo pobre para la franquicia que como pel√≠cula infantil puede encantar a los ni√±os, pero no a los adultos. Mi calificaci√≥n final para esta pel√≠cula es un 6/10."
"Oct 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Loved the perfectly campy wholesome good-natured, child-empowerment message delivered throughout the movie. Over the last 15+ years, most movies and tv shows targeted to children include the glorification of bratty, sarcastic and disrespectful children or characters. Even Disney is guilty of this. But the entire Spy Kids franchise (especially this newest installment) breaks that mold. These are movies that parents can trust will make their children better people for watching."
"Oct 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Love this new Spy Kids: Armageddon movie. Very nicely done!
"Oct 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"N√£o vai reinventar a roda do cinema infantil de forma alguma, mas se voc√™ estiver disposto a se envolver com o filme em seu n√≠vel, encontrar√° muita divers√£o."
"Oct 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie passed the time, but it will not be remembered."
"Oct 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,Es muy terrible los efectos son malos los adultos son tontos y ni√±os son molestos las padres no tienen qu√≠mica el villano es olvidable pel√≠cula es peor que la 4 es la peor de la franquicia y es aburridaaa 3 de 10
"Oct 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,Worst Spy Kids movie ever.
"Sep 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,Well these people are terrible parents. Cool Villain tho!
"Sep 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The film in itself is not 100% bad since it does bring a few fun things but I do not feel the essence of the previous films nor did it cause me interest in continuing to watch it from approximately minute 15 onwards, the film is very repetitive and not very entertaining at all. many moments, I don't recommend it very much and if you like the saga less (Machete doesn't come out either) and they focus a lot on the technology as if it were something new that they are showing, the CGI did not improve much, something that was expected taking into account the time between The films also have a somewhat accelerated story without many plot explanations. Something that was not very favorable is that they copied jokes and moments from past films without taking into account the humor of the previous ones."
"Sep 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,I only give it a star because zachary Levi is in it.
"Sep 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,An attempt at combining all three spy kids movies mashed into one but didn't succeed doing any of them.
"Sep 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I have never seen a movie try to teach me something so terribly, when I watch it with my dad he fell asleep and I have never heard him snore so loud before he was feeling so good to go to sleep while watching this movie. The graphics where at the same level as Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over made all the way in 2003 I have seen YouTube videos with higher quality. When watching this I was rethinking life I wanted to watch something else I wanted to go to sleep, it like watching the WNBA, I don't need melatonin I need this movie. Also the answer is not always be nice it's a good way to solve stuff but not always, thank you and good night"
"Sep 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Like many people my age, I grew up as a fan of the ""Spy Kids"" franchise. I think the first two hold up well and while it may be because of nostalgia, I genuinely feel like I can go back and watch them and enjoy them even today. The third one is deeply flawed, but that one I know for sure I enjoy it because of nostalgia. The fourth movie was a trainwreck, and unfortunately, so is ""Armageddon."" I will go ahead and say that if I was a kid, I probably would have loved this movie. Sadly it just doesn't have the wide appeal for all audiences. The movie is silly and somewhat recycles old ideas from previous movies with newer special effects. Overall, the franchise has fallen apart for me, and maybe it is because I have grown up, but I'm leaning towards that not being the reason, this movie just doesn't have that good of a story or characters when compared to the originals."
"Sep 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Admittedly, I've been a huge fan of Robert Rodriguez since ""Desperado"". I didn't get into the ""Spy Kids"" and ""Lava Girl"" stuff because I didn't have kids back then. I do now, and I'm loving watching all of RR's kids' movies with them. This one does not disappoint! Lots of kids' fun and Spy Kids energy throughout."
"Sep 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Bad CGI bad writing and horrible players and i really liked the first movie, and not only it its just the first movies plot twists but just worse. Anyway just please if its a sequel just STOP! And think"
"Sep 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,The acting from kids were bad seems like a story a kid would write. The diologe was cringy
"Sep 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Won't let me 0 star, movie is trash"
"Sep 28, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great fun from start to finish! In a movie made for kids to enjoy, the kids shine. Love this reboot - we hope they make more!"
"Sep 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,Cutesy children's flick.
"Sep 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie is awful!!! The CGI is useless like the skeletons and the game universe. This is a reboot that nobody asked. The game ""Hyskor"" that is in the apocalypse, isn't even good. The way you play the game when you want to get into their technology is bad. Boom this movie is not what I want to recommend."
"Sep 27, 2023",POSITIVE,This was a seriously fun watch. A perfect combination of nostalgia and novelty for a new generation. I have already watched it three times with my kiddos and find something new and funny every time.
"Sep 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Considering ""Spy Kids: Armageddon"" is basically just the original ""Spy Kids"" movie but with crappy CG, poorly developed characters and rehashed plot-points from the worst ""Spy Kids"" entry of the lot (""Spy Kids 3D""), you'd best just go watch the first two, because they're monstrously better than this abomination of a requel."
"Sep 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen
"Sep 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie rocks!! The production, cinematography, and acting was proficiently exceptional. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and it even brought me to tears. This movie changed my life, i even had to go to therapy. Cannot recommend this absolutely fabulous movie enoughüò≠üòç‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Sep 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Worst film I've seen, it ruined my childhood memories, I feel sorry for the kids that have watched it."
"Sep 26, 2023",POSITIVE,i think we all thought this would suck but this is a funny good action movie and maybe the best in the series. i feel like they did better acting in this movie then the other ones
"Sep 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Has the charm of the first Spy Kids while still being funny and fun. Definitely a good time for the whole family!
"Sep 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,I grew up with these movies and it's gotten absolutely horrendous. The plot is all over the place. They tried to bake in some life lessons and it falls flat. I would say this movie tries to combine elements of 1-3 into one movie but it just doesn't work. Completely misses the mark and is a waste of time.
"Sep 26, 2023",POSITIVE,I always loved the Spy Kids movies and this was a treat. It was so much fun to share these movies with my family... Hoping there's more!
"Sep 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Such a fun movie for the entire family. LOVED IT!!
"Sep 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was quite entertaining and very well done. I know it's aimed at children but, there were a lot of easter eggs and references to the original trilogy. I think the new spy kids are great actors and they really look the part. I loved that Robert Rodriguez still used his old style while Racer Max tried to keep it modern."
"Sep 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Robert you've done it again. To be honest this movie isn't the best I mean its Directed to a younger audience but I'm surprised I didn't see 3D goop plastered on my screen. This movie is just trying to put all the Usual things kids might say but in reality they don't say it to be honest.
"Sep 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Wanted a fun light hearted movie instead got a lecture on ethics from a nine year old
"Sep 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I've watched every spy kids movie, I grew up watching them. This movie was bad, really bad"
"Sep 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie doesn't fit into any sort of category- and not in a good way. There's not enough action to call it an action movie, not enough thrills to call it a thriller, and NO laughs to call it a comedy. I don't know how many more signs we need at this point that the Spy Kids franchise has RUN ITS COURSE. Netflix, stop trying to continue this franchise, you'll only run it further into the ground. Let it go and start trying to salvage what you can of the franchise and its fans at this point, because it doesn't look like there is going to be a lot left if you continue on this path."
"Sep 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The movie is laughably bad and full of recycled material. Anyone who saw the originals would hate this movie and how it disrespects them with its flat jokes and bland dialogue. I don't even know how this got made, clearly it was a money grab by greedy executives."
"Sep 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As someone who watched and loved the original spy kids when I was at that age, this movie misses the mark. They attempted to re-create the same stories with all the same beats and messages, I found myself consistently checking how long was left and overall not immersed in the movie."
"Sep 24, 2023",POSITIVE,don't let the critics fool you: every spy kids movie is a tour de force of tour de forces.
"Sep 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,I fell asleep halfway through. Didn't hold my attention unfortunately. Went back and watched the rest. A CGI mess. Weird cuts. Poor visuals. Horrible voice quality (still irritable when clear). Always looking around confused. Doesn't install any confidence for a better sequel.
"Sep 24, 2023",POSITIVE,A good revival of the spy kids movie series!
"Sep 24, 2023",POSITIVE,It is a really good movie.
"Sep 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,It felt like a bad copy and paste version of the original movies. It shouldn't even fit into a category of sequel more like an attempt at a reboot.
"Sep 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"What can I say‚Ä¶ this movie was just awful. The lead child actors are far too young and their acting abilities just aren't ready yet, the whole tone of the movie feels like their target audience was solely 6 years olds and below, without remotely considering the much love older generations still have for the original movies. Cringey scenes and a bad guy you agree with for the entire movie, he was probably the best part."
"Sep 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"This was a fun movie, good message about hard work and honesty: my 11 year old really enjoyed it!"
"Sep 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Horrible, cargada de ideolog√≠a, el pap√° en la pel√≠cula es un tonto y la ni√±a s√∫per pesada, no la soport√©. Totalmente woke, adem√°s de unas terribles actuaciones. ¬øQu√© le hicieron a Robert Rodr√≠guez?"
"Sep 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Que aburrida, no tiene nada de chispa, fue una tortura poder terminarla. Pesimo gui√≥n y actuaciones, se ve muy improvisado"
"Sep 24, 2023",POSITIVE,We love it. It should be brought into the Spy Kids 1-2-3 story of the movie
"Sep 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Watched it last night! Great movie for the kids out on Netflix!
"Sep 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun family film. Kids especially will like the action and effects. Is everything believable? Of course not - this is a fun fantasy film for kids and is not intended to be a critically acclaimed blockbuster.  It's a fun movie with a positive message. The kids, Patty and Tony  (Everly Carganilla and Connor Esterson) play well off each other and make the movie fun to watch. Kids will want to watch this one multiple times.  Heck - even I want to see it again!"
"Sep 23, 2023",POSITIVE,It was a fun movie to watch and had a positive message. Would I see it again? YES!
"Sep 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a great new generation of Spy Kids for today's littles! Without trying to give any spoilers, I like the direction they went with for the overall message and lesson, the ""moral of the story,"" if you will. The family unit had so much chemistry together, it was very believable. The children actors, Everly Carganilla and Connor Esterson, were a joy to watch. Their personalities complemented each other so well. Also, loved the ""bad guy,"" and his over the top diabolical grin. This movie is about good overcoming evil and will be an AWESOME influence for this new generation of kiddos (and grown ups!) - learning to be compassionate for and empathetic of others, even the ""bad guys""."
"Sep 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"As someone who grew up on the original Spy Kids movies, I thought this was a great combination of nostalgia and fresh new faces and technology. It is so awesome, so much fun, and a definite must-see for the whole family. The cast is amazing. Hope to see them all return for a sequel! Will definitely be watching this one on repeat until then!"
"Sep 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Super fun family film!
"Sep 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I've read quite a few reviews of this movie, and while not all of them seem entirely unbiased, that's the nature of reviews.

As a massive fan of the original movies, they hold a special place among my all-time favorites.

Now, let's be honest, this movie isn't flawless. Occasionally, it did lean towards a more child-friendly vibe, and it did incorporate some nods to the original films, which had its pros and cons. On the downside, it occasionally felt a tad derivative. On the upside, the nods helped you reminisce and they aimed to elevate the experience.

Despite its imperfections, I genuinely enjoyed this movie, and I would eagerly watch it again. The casting was spot-on for the intended audience. While they may not quite reach the iconic status of Juni and Carmen, they come remarkably close. It's a fantastic family film that still manages to spark every child's dream of becoming a spy with the coolest gadgets in the world, not to mention that awesome safe house stocked with snacks.

Visually, I was captivated by the game-like feel it brought to the movie, which added a unique and exciting dimension to the experience.

One area that could benefit from improvement is the portrayal of the OSS. It was somewhat disappointing to see them portrayed in a comedic light.

Let me emphasize that this is a substantial improvement over ""Spy Kids: All The Time In The World,"" which was frankly subpar.

Initially, I was hesitant and disappointed that the original cast wouldn't be in this film. However, they did an admirable job, and I'm excited to see the next installment in theaters.

The directors should acknowledge that they are catering to a young audience with these movies while considering the dedicated fan base. As a 25-year-old who still loves these films, it would be wonderful if they found a balance, although the ""Spy Kids"" remake is already a step in the right direction, offering a family-friendly adventure that's visually captivating."
"Sep 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,For a retread it sure could be worse.
"Sep 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,The beginning was OK. I personally hated the acting. The CGI was at times good and at times shit. The ending and the plot were trash. Why would an Agency listen to kids?
"Sep 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"As an ardent fan of the original Spy Kids franchise during my childhood, I approached the latest installment, Spy Kids: Armageddon, with a mix of excitement and skepticism. The original movies captivated my imagination with their unique concept of featuring young spies, a refreshing departure from the adult-dominated spy genre of the time. These films made me believe that intelligence and heroism were not limited to grown-ups, but something that even kids like me could aspire to.

One of the aspects that made the original Spy Kids movies so enthralling was the way they showcased the transformation of ordinary children into extraordinary secret agents. The storyline revolved around their mission to rescue their captured parents and save the world from imminent danger. This premise resonated deeply with me as a child, fueling my desire to become a spy and thwart the plans of evildoers. Moreover, the movies' futuristic technology, such as touchscreen watches and smartphones, seemed light-years ahead of what we had at the time. It fueled our fascination with advanced gadgets and made us yearn for similar technological marvels in our own lives.

However, when it comes to the latest Spy Kids: Armageddon, I must admit that it may not have the same impact on those who have already seen a plethora of spy movies or the original Spy Kids films. Other recent movies like ""The Adventures of Lavagirl and Sharkboy"" and ""We Can Be Heroes"" have also showcased kids as superheroes battling villains, making the concept less novel. Additionally, with the rapid advancements in technology, what was once groundbreaking in the early 2000s may not hold the same allure for today's tech-savvy generation.

Nevertheless, I believe that younger audiences who are new to the Spy Kids universe will find enjoyment in this film. For them, the movie will offer a fresh and exciting perspective, igniting their imaginations and sparking their interest in the world of espionage. It's important to remember that every generation has its own unique experiences and expectations, and this film has the potential to captivate a new cohort of young viewers.

In conclusion, while Spy Kids: Armageddon may not provide the same level of novelty and originality for those familiar with the franchise or similar movies, it still has the potential to entertain and inspire a younger audience. The magic lies in its ability to introduce a new generation to the thrilling world of spy adventures, even if our present reality is vastly different from the time when the original Spy Kids movies took the world by storm."
"Sep 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just an awful watch.
"Sep 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"1) It's not a ""sequel"", it's a reboot.
2) It wasn't made for critical acclaim.
3) It's everything I hoped for (and expected) in a Robert Rodriguez family film.
4) There's a lot of humor and action for kids and adults, alike.
5 - STARS. I am a parent. I know how kids like to watch the same movie multiple times in long stretches. I won't mind watching this one multiple times. It's fun."
"Sep 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie delivered an epic family movie night and my kids are both obsessed!! It's exactly what we wanted it to be. Exciting, wholesome, adorable, (I love that crab Bronson). We will surely be watching on repeat for the foreseeable future!!:)"
"Sep 23, 2023",POSITIVE,I freaking love this film it has all the feels like the first one!!!
"Sep 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"The kids LOVED it! Their smiles and laughs were delightful. Wonderful movie, action packed with a wholesome message. As soon as it ended, their imagination took flight! They played SPY KIDS for an hour afterwards. Bravo!"
"Sep 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Exactly what I expected. An excellent movie for the kids. Exciting with a positive motivating storyline and ending!
"Sep 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Big fan of Zachary Levi, but if your going to reboot a series, do it different and better. Not that much different and so much worse. Not trying to be mean about kid actors, but these kid actors annoyed the living crap out of me, especially the boy."
"Sep 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"had the spy kids vibes. it's a perfect mix of all the previous movies. would love to see a sequel, maybe with the previous cast included? (jessica alba, alexa penavvega, daryl sabara, danny trejo, emily osment, selena gomez, rowan blanchard, just to name a few lol)"
"Sep 23, 2023",POSITIVE,Love this new spy family. My entire family loved it!
"Sep 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"I never understood that why should something have to ""live upto the original"" it should be respected and appreciated individually nothing wrong with creating it's own new charm they can coexist one doesn't have to be in another's shadow imo"
"Sep 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It didn't seem like this franchise could have been run further into the ground after Spy Kids 4, but Hollywood has proved me wrong once again. Spy Kids FIVE, mind you FIVE, repeats a now stale concept and just like number four, it doesn't do anything new or interesting, but focuses more on unfunny jokes, and nonexistent character development. Mind you, I LOVED the original Spy Kids. It had a fresh concept which was played out really well. However, the longer this franchise went on, the more the filmmakers have tried to ""modernize"" this crap for younger children so they can watch with their parents, but completely misses the mark by not providing any sort of humor or relatable moments to strike a chord with its younger audience, and adults will similarly be disgusted by what this once great franchise has become."
"Sep 22, 2023",POSITIVE,My kids absolutely loved this film. They laughed throughout. And my husband and I loved the message of always better to tell the truth and play fair.
"Sep 22, 2023",POSITIVE,It is such a wonderfully family movie!  We loved it!!
"Sep 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"So AWESOME! So happy SPY KIDS is back!!!
Rodriguez did an amazing job for the next generation of new SPY KIDS fans!"
"Sep 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A cheap knockoff of the origanal.
I'm general the visuals weren't bad considering that this doesn't seem like a high budget film, however most of the story is so blatantly stolen from the previous movies that you can pinpoint which conversation comes from which movie, even if you haven't seen the movies in years."
"Sep 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Great combo of nostalgia and family fun. Well done!
"Sep 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was literally the same plot as the first Spy Kids except with minor things changed. I would definitely rather watch the original ,since it has the same plot and better actors"
"Sep 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"For someone who grew up with the original spy kids, it was a nice zone of nostalgia, the odd Easter egg here and there with inside jokes like the long name. Had a great laugh and a great way to kick off the OSS once more."
"Sep 22, 2023",POSITIVE,Our family loved the film especially my kids!  Best Spy Kids film since the original!
