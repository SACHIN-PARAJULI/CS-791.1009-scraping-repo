"Oct 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Unfortunately, it's much of the same and it isn't very good. "
"Oct 25, 2023",POSITIVE," A pesar de ser exactamente lo mismo que inició esta franquicia hace dos décadas, con “Spy Kids Armageddon” Robert Rodríguez logra revitalizar el concepto original con la tecnología actual y con la creatividad de colaboradores nuevos. El que estos nuevos integrantes de su equipo de producción sean los hijos del director, que ahora lo ayudan con el guion, edición, diseño de sonido y con la producción en general, le da un toque especial al quinto filme de una serie que celebra la importancia del núcleo familiar."
"Oct 3, 2023",NEUTRAL," PLOT: When the children of the world’s greatest secret agents unwittingly help a powerful Game Developer unleash a computer virus that gives him control of all technology, they must become spies themselves to save their parents and the world. REVIEW: Robert Rodriguez has always had two distinct film output: mature genre offerings aimed at adult audiences and family-friendly action flicks aimed at the youngest viewers. While Rodriguez’s Troublemaker Studios has used in-house special effects work to deliver pulpy flicks like Machete and the recent Hypnotic, the full-blown CGI worlds of the Spy Kids films have given the indie filmmaker a playground to make every childhood fantasy come to life. After four films centered on the Cortez family of spies, Rodriguez and his son Racer Max have written a franchise reboot centered on two new pint-sized agents as they use their knowledge of video games to save their parents and the world. Spy Kids: Armageddon is a decidedly low-budget affair that is bound to entertain only the youngest of viewers as it struggles to find the charm that the original cast brought to the first film in the series. Spy Kids: Armageddon sticks very closely to the formula of the four prior entries in the franchise. The new multi-ethnic spy family here is the Tango-Torrez clan. Nora (Gina Rodriguez) and Terrence (Zachary Levi) are the parents and secret spies, taking over for Carla Gugino and Antonio Banderas, as well as Jessica Alba and Joel McHale. Nora and Terrence are parents to Patty (Everly Carganilla) and Tony (Connor Esterson), two precocious grade-schoolers who love video games and technology. Terrence has locked down their use of devices due to his fear of what technology can do in the wrong hands. Like their predecessors, Terrence and Nora work for OSS and report to Devlin (D.J. Cotrona taking over for George Clooney). Terrence invented the Armageddon Code, a powerful tool to hack any tech. That code is also what game designer Rey Kingston (Billy Magnussen) wants so that he can take over the world using his popular Lowscor and Hyscor video game franchise. Once the Armageddon Code is stolen by Kingston, Patty and Tony become official OSS agents to rescue their parents as well as being way better at video games than the Boomers and Gen-Xers who run the spy agency. Conveniently, Terrence and Nora built a safe house full of training material, candy, and gadgets for the pint-sized kids to employ as master spies. From there, the film blends Robert Rodriguez’s prior films’ over-the-top action and pratfall comedy with the family-friendly CGI monsters of Kingston’s video game realm. Like the second and third films in the series, Spy Kids: Armageddon spends more than half of its running time inside a video game realm that looks cartoonish and not at all scary. If anything, the character design is a cross between the aesthetic of the prior movies mixed with an homage to Ray Harryhausen. The skeleton warriors were a highlight and reminded me of how fun old-school stop-motion was. While the skeletons are a fun and silly callback to Clash of the Titans, the CGI reminds me of just how silly the Spy Kids movies are. The Spy Kids movies have always been aimed at a young audience and do not grow with their target viewers, meaning each sequel holds less nostalgia than the ones that came out when I was younger. Adults will groan at Zachary Levi and Billy Magnussen’s over-the-top performances, delivered so broadly that even the youngest watching can read the emotion on their faces. There is little subtext in movies like this, but Gina Rodriguez gives a solid performance that is easily the best in the whole movie. Unfortunately, the kids themselves are nowhere near the talent that Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara brought to the first movies. I hate to knock child actors, but these kids shift wildly from scene to scene. At one moment, they believably exist in this fantastical adventure, and in others, they sound like they are reading recipe instructions with out-of-character enthusiasm. Little kids may relate to these youthful protagonists, but adults will be left groaning at the poor quality of the overall story. The silliness of the Spy Kids movies was always front and center, but it was offset by tons of famous faces gracing the movies in ridiculous roles. The star power of the first films is virtually nonexistent here, with none of the signature cameos that made the first movies bearable. While Zachary Levi is known as Shazam by most audiences, when he is the biggest star in the movie, you have a problem. None of Robert Rodriguez’s repertory players even make a brief appearance here. Even Cheech Marin or Danny Trejo could have boosted this movie a bit. Instead, there is nothing for grown-ups to latch onto as this movie skews towards the pre-teen set. Co-written with his son, Racer Max, Robert Rodriguez made this project a family affair. Like The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl, based on an idea by Racer Max, Spy Kids: Armageddon is the most ridiculous movie that Rodriguez has made to date while still having credible production values, editing, and music. Spy Kids: Armageddon is easily one of the weakest movies that Robert Rodriguez has directed and would never have warranted a big-screen release. Even as a Netflix original, Armageddon is less enjoyable than the prior entry to debut on the platform, Spy Kids: All the Time in the World. At least that movie tried something original by having only one of the parents be a spy. Here, the biggest twist is that one of the kids doesn’t want to be a spy because lying is wrong, but that conceit goes out the window once the action kicks into gear. Even at 97 minutes, this movie feels an hour too long and will not be fun for anyone but the youngest of viewers, and I think even they will be bored after half an hour. A weak movie in a franchise that should never have gone past one sequel, Spy Kids: Armageddon is not good at all. Alex Maidy has been a JoBlo.com editor, columnist, and critic since 2012.

"Oct 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"  WHAT IT'S ABOUT Robert Rodriguez reboots the ""Spy Kids"" franchise for Netflix. This time around, Zachary Levi and Gina Rodriguez take over as the parents, while Connor Esterson and Everly Carganilla step in as the siblings.   Kids Tony (Esterson) and Patty Torrez-Tango (Carganilla) are stunned to discover that their ""boring"" and ""ordinary"" parents are in fact top-secret spies. But the espionage gene pool is strong, so when the time comes, the youngsters are well-equipped to rescue Mom and Dad from the clutches of an evil video game developer (Billy Magnussen).   MY SAY It's been 22 years since the original movie and whatever might have once seemed fresh and funny about the whole ""Spy Kids"" universe has long since rotted away.   The fact that Rodriguez, once considered in some quarters to have been a peer of Quentin Tarantino, has been reduced to going back to this safe space again only makes it extra sad.   This is one tired and wheezy project, a movie without any reason for being other than to cash in one some easy streaming bucks. It's so flat that if you were told it was the first feature film made entirely by, say, ChatGPT or whatever new AI platform might do such a thing, it wouldn't be a big shock.   The plot, which involves some sort of MacGuffin computer virus called an ""Armageddon key,"" barely makes sense. And even if you tried to wrap your head around it, there's no reason to bother, because it's just an excuse for a bunch of action scenes set against CGI backdrops that would not have looked out of place on a '90s computer screen saver.   Levi (""Shazam!"") and Gina Rodriguez (""Jane the Virgin"") lack even an iota of the charm and charisma of their predecessors, Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino. They're not given anything close to the sharp writing that once characterized the franchise, with its keen satire of suburban family life and upending of conventions in the parent-child relationship.   But they make nothing out of whatever little bit they do get from Rodriguez and his co-writer, the director's 26-year-old son and frequent collaborator Racer Max. Instead, they seem to be disinterested in the whole project. And the perceived attitude is infectious.   The kids could never be accused of going through the motions, but Tony and Patty have not a single discernible character trait. Only Magnussen (""Game Night"") as Rey ""The King"" Kingston gets some juicy material and really evokes the appropriate campy spirit.   This new ""Spy Kids"" surely portends more from the same universe. Hollywood will never shake its addiction to familiar franchises and sequels and reboots and reboots of reboots. There's no fighting it.   But even upon returning once again to the same old well, the audience must be given something more than this: a retread in every respect, a movie that epitomizes going through the motions. "
"Oct 1, 2023",NEGATIVE," Children’s movies are always a challenge to review. How do I, an adult man, reasonably assess the quality of a movie not made for me? I’ll try my best. Spy Kids: Armageddon is the fifth movie in Robert Rodriguez’s long-running Spy Kids franchise. This time, Rodriguez does away with the Cortez family we followed in the first four movies. We’re in full reboot mode with another set of kids joining the O.S.S. to become spies.  If I were to analyze this movie objectively, it’s a poorly written, visually unappealing movie that is only catered to young children. Which isn’t automatically a bad thing, but we’ll get there. It’s no secret that Rodriguez makes the Spy Kids movies for his children. The original trilogy is a source of nostalgia for many people who watched it as a kid. I watched them recently, and even I found enjoyment in them. Parts of those movies still hold up, and it’s poetic that Rodriguez is now making Spy Kids: Armageddon with his children, who worked on the script and the musical score for the film. There’s a special place in Rodriguez’s heart for Spy Kids, but ever since that original trilogy, he cannot seem to crack the code. Spy Kids: Armageddon is an amalgamation of everything we’ve seen before, but worse. The premise most closely resembles the original Spy Kids movie and Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over! It recycles the formula of the first movie, where a brother and sister find out their parents are spies and they must team up to save their kidnapped parents. However, instead of a children’s show, the plot surrounds a video game that has populated nearly every screen on Earth. Our spy family must work together to stop the developer, The King (Billy Magnussen), from taking over the world. This feels like a weak attempt at adapting those classic films for a modern era while losing the charm that made the original three work. We have the “saving parents” storyline from the first one, the skeleton battles from Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams, the video games of Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over, and an overfixation on the word “armageddon” from Spy Kids: All the Time in the World. This is the recycled leftovers of the franchise, offering nothing new to say besides giving you another adventure with another brother and sister. Oh, and one of them is good at hacking. Because of course they are. Spy Kids: Armageddon repackages what we’ve already seen in a glossy, 2023 casing. Let’s talk about the cast this time around. I find it interesting that Spy Kids: All the Time in the World was Rodriguez’s first attempt at giving the series new life with a new brother-sister duo. However, since that movie failed, we have yet another brother-sister duo that cannot replace the chemistry of Carmen and Juni Cortez. The characters feel like archetypes, with Tony (Connor Esterson) being the rule-breaker and Patty (Everly Carganilla) as the more straightlaced one. The chemistry, charm, and banter are not nearly as strong as what we saw in the original trilogy. When rebooting a franchise with fresh faces, that chemistry makes or breaks it. We also have Zachary Levi and Gina Rodriguez as the new parents. Levi is pulling from his typical bag of tricks as a charming adult with a few childlike qualities. He’s charismatic in the role, and Rodriguez is perfectly acceptable in her role, but there’s a heart and soul that’s missing from the center of this movie. We get pieces of what made the original Spy Kids movie fun, like the gadgets and the action. However, most of the action is pretty forgettable, all blending together to the point where you don’t remember much of the imagery. The final action sequence resembles a ripoff of the Battle of Mustafar from Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith. There’s also no subtlety in the writing. It’s not quite as bad as the 2011 sequel, where nearly every line of dialogue contained the word “time.” However, Spy Kids: Armageddon tackles themes of lying and honesty. This film gets super preachy about its messages that honesty is the best policy and you can solve problems without violence. While it’s good that children get these messages, the execution is weak. Children deserve great, well-written movies just as much as adults do. The best thing I can say about this movie is that since kids may find the 2001 film outdated, they might enjoy a more modern take on the premise. The kids will likely have a lot of fun watching this movie. After all, they are the target demographic. But objectively, this is a derivative, uninspired sequel that does not hold a candle to the originals. As ComingSoon’s review policy explains, a score of 3 equates to “Bad.” Due to significant issues, this media feels like a chore to take in.

"Sep 29, 2023",NEUTRAL," “Spy Kids: Armageddon” is co-written and directed by Robert Rodriguez. This reboot of the beloved franchise follows the Tango-Torres family. Tony (Connor Esterson) and Patty (Everly Carganilla) are left with the responsibility of saving the world after their parents, Terrence (Zachary Levi) and Nora (Gina Rodriguez) are captured by game developer, The King (Billy Magnussen), who is trying to take over the world. Learning about the production of this project made me hesitant because I unapologetically hold a nostalgic bond to the original trilogy. After all, Juni and Carmen were the kids I grew up watching and admiring.  However, I’m also conscious of the evolving technology and the newer generations. So, I was relieved to learn that Robert Rodriguez, the original creator of the trilogy, was collaborating with his son, Racer Rodriguez. Where Robert’s upbringing heavily influenced the original trilogy, this latest version would be more influenced by his children’s upbringing.  “Spy Kids: Armageddon” stays true to its essence, depicting children as more than capable of saving the world. The film is aware of its audience and goes out of its way to service them. By highlighting video games and the competitiveness that comes with them, the premise showcases the importance of learning to move forward with the times while granting children the opportunity to further develop their technological skills. In this case, it’s those skills that make it possible to save the world. This film could be better though. The dialogue may be corny at times but in this instance, I’ll make an exception because I’m not the targeted demographic. The “Spy Kids” franchise distinguishes itself by depicting children as cool with hero qualities.  Rodriguez reminds us that kids are not helpless, in constant need of protection nor are they dumb. We underestimate their capacity to be creative and intelligent. Additionally, their innocence makes them compassionate, a quality that is emphasized throughout the film. If we were all a little more compassionate and understanding, maybe the world would look a little different. The iconic score returns with added layers of guitar sequences, giving a familiar but unique feeling. It’s a nice reminder that we’re watching a Robert Rodriguez movie.  The action sequences are entertaining and will keep the little ones engaged. The villains have fun fighting scenes. Some even have a child-friendly design. There are some fun moments I found inventive. For example, as part of taking over all the technological devices (whether it’s alarms, phones, home security systems, ATMs, cars, etc.), people must pass a level of the game to unlock those devices. The family dynamic worked. Tony and Patty convinced me of their sibling relationship, while Gina and Zachary sold me on their marriage. The quartet played out fairly well when they were together on screen. Overall, “Spy Kids: Armageddon” does a good job rebooting the franchise for the newer generations. It does pay homage to the original trilogy while also introducing new ideas and adventures. It’s engaging, funny, and a solid adventure where children are heroes and protagonists of this story.

"Sep 29, 2023",POSITIVE," Spy Kids is one of those ideas someone was bound to come up with eventually, a combination of two words that, in the right hands, reads like a license to print money. It’s no wonder, then, that franchise creator Robert Rodriguez produced four mid-budget Spy Kids features over the course of a decade, and they collectively earned more than half a billion dollars worldwide. But there’s more to Spy Kids than just taking a couple of cute children and giving them gadgets to play with. These movies are at their best when they  say something about family and how kids see the world. So, along comes Spy Kids: Armageddon, the first reboot in the franchise’s history, and the first Spy Kids movie in more than a decade, to attempt to do just that. The results are, perhaps unsurprisingly for a Netflix kids adventure, a bit mixed, but in the hands of Rodriguez and his son and co-writer Racer Max, this latest installment in the series is a very pleasant family adventure, provided you’re willing to meet the film on its terms. If you’ve seen any of the original films, you know the basic setup here: Two kids are unknowingly the children of world-class secret agents, their parents are threatened, and they must learn spycraft and become “spy kids” to save the world as a family. This time around, the kids are Patty (Everly Carganilla) and Tony (Connor Esterson). Patty is a rule-follower extraordinaire, always concerned with fairness and goodness, while Tony is a classic rule-breaker, doing his best to skirt the rules to get what he wants, whether that’s winning at a video game or just earning extra privileges around the house. The kids’ parents, Terrence (Zachary Levi) and Nora (Gina Rodriguez) combat this by limiting screen and device time for both children, while wrestling  with when and how to break the news to Patty and Tony that they’re actually superspies.  The secret is broken when an evil game developer called The King (Billy Magnussen) gets his hands on “The Armageddon Code,” a spy device so powerful it can break into any electronic system. With The King out to change the world  by making everything into a game, and Nora and Terrence in the hands of The King’s evil video game minions, it’s up to Patty and Tony to learn how to become spies so they can save their family, and the world. The adults in the room will, of course, figure out where a lot of this is going right away, and Rodriguez and Max structure their script to include lots of knowing winks at the more mature members of their audience. They’re playing by classic spy movie rules, they know it, and they’re more than happy to let viewers in on that. Still, even the winks and nods, helped along by Levi and Rodriguez’s performances as superspy parents, can get a little trying if you’ve run the gauntlet of action movies for kids over the years. At least  the film is making an effort to do something a little bit more sophisticated. This is a kids’ movie, first and foremost, which means many of the jokes and set pieces are designed so they won’t go over the heads of younger viewers. That doesn’t make the film bad,  but the trick to Armageddon working as a family-pleasing feature lies not in the plotting or the jokes, but in the themes Rodriguez and Max are trying to explore. Every 21st-century kid can relate to having their tablets and game consoles taken away, just like every 21st-century parent can relate to the anxieties of trying to limit their kids’ exposure to an increasingly open and strange world. Max and Rodriguez latch onto these everyday concerns, then take them one step further, imagining a world in which the devices that parents and children fight over aren’t just distractions, but active antagonists so sophisticated that the people who use them most, i.e. the kids, might be the only ones capable of saving the world from their influence.  The film’s villain is a man out to gamify everything, convinced that only he can master the world’s problems, who’s also sure that visual technology and just about everything else peaked in the 2000s (a fun nod to the film’s slightly throwback CGI designs). The heroes, two young people who want to bring all the things they love together, are just trying to find a way for their entertainment and their family dynamic to co-exist. It’s not hard to see the message the movie’s trying to send, and thanks to winning performances from Carganilla, Esterson, and most importantly Magnussen (who’s having a ball), that message mostly gets across. Throw in a few fun set pieces, some dynamic creature designs, and a breezy narrative that zips by before your eyes, and Spy Kids: Armageddon comes away as a film that mostly works. It’s not going to reinvent the kids’ movie wheel by any means, but if you’re willing to engage with the film on its level, you’ll find a lot of fun to be had."
"Sep 28, 2023",NEUTRAL," The story: A cursed knife, discovered by chance, condemns three siblings to participate in malign versions of the old-school games hangman, tag and hide-and-seek where if they lose, they die. “I Will Play, I Won’t Quit” is the incantation carved into the sinister blade – and an empty promise of All Fun And Games. The games are carelessly played. They barely get under way. The perverse concept of childhood fun being death traps has no follow-through in a standard teen slasher horror that is further dulled by an expository info dump on the knife’s origin: The town is present-day Salem, Massachusetts, so 17th-century witchcraft is predictably behind the misfortunes.  Dad is long gone. Mum (Annabeth Gish) has added a late shift at work to make ends meet, leaving Marcus (Asa Butterfield), Billie (Natalia Dyer), their little brother Jo (Benjamin Evan Ainsworth) and two friends on their own the night they unwittingly summon the demon. With glassy eyes and the knife for weapon, he pursues the others out into the woods and back into the house, at which point the only game is one of everybody running away from him to avoid being killed.  Ari Costa was an associate producer on Anthony and Joe Russo’s Marvel Cinematic Universe blockbusters Captain America: Civil War (2016), Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), and the Russo brothers have returned the favour by executive-producing Costa’s co-directing and co-writing debut with Eren Celeboglu.  The story: When power-mad game developer Rey “The King” Kingston (Billy Magnussen) gains possession of a code that can control all technology, two children of a super-spy couple become spies themselves to save the planet. Texas-based film-maker Robert Rodriguez returns for a fifth Spy Kids feature after 12 years, rebooting his beloved early 2000s kiddie franchise with a new cast of characters for a next generation weaned on iPads and Nintendos.
 Spy Kids: Armageddon introduces the Tango-Torrez clan of elite agents Terrence (Zachary Levi) and Nora (Gina Rodriguez) and their totes adorbs tots: rebellious Tony (Connor Esterson) and virtuous Patty (Everly Carganilla).
 Good thing Tony has been sneaking around the restrictions to level up his tech skills because The King has turned the world into a retro-futuristic video game and abducted their parents.  Robert Rodriguez understands what children want, which is to be the heroes of their own fantasy games, and this fun adventure – complete with skeleton army, cool gadgets, spy suits and an underwater safe house – is aimed squarely at pre-teens.  He is again the director, writer, editor, cinematographer and special effects supervisor, producing in partnership with Netflix, which hosted his 2018 Spy Kids: Mission Critical animation series. One of his sons, Racer Max, co-scripted, while another, Rebel, composed the score. "
"Sep 27, 2023",NEUTRAL," Fresh from a nice fall vacation, I have collected a number of theatrical and streaming releases to look into, along with a few to pass on. This set of write-ups includes a classic concert doc, a unique home invasion flick, a satirical vampire film, a sports documentary, an inspiring biopic, an Indian-themed horror film, a family action comedy reboot, and an explosive action sequel. The following features reviews for Stop Making Sense, No One Will Save You, El Conde, BS High, A Million Miles Away, It Lives Inside, Spy Kids: Armageddon, and Expend4bles. The Setup: A24 has brought director Jonathan Demme’s seminal 1984 concert doc, STOP MAKING SENSE, back to theaters for its 40th anniversary, newly restored in pristine 4K. Demme captures the frantic energy and artsy groove of David Bryne and the Talking Heads in this concert movie shot at the Hollywood Pantages Theatre in 1983. Review: It’s hard to say what would make for the best concert film ever. Should it be an expansive epic like Woodstock, or is it about capturing an iconic album performed in full? Maybe, like with The Last Waltz, it just needs the hands of Martin Scorsese on it to work out so well. Personally, given how it captures a specific place in time and is combined with great music and comedy, I’ll always stand up for Dave Chappelle’s Block Party from 2005. Of course, I’m also just stalling because what more needs to be said about Stop Making Sense? It’s an iconic concert doc that found Demme doing all that was required to capture the lovable energy of David Byrne, the Talking Heads, and friends. Originally filmed over four nights, the results are a terrific piece of filmmaking that finds all the right ways to show a performance that begins as minimalist as possible and expands into something truly joyous, as well as weird, funky, and very fun. Whatever the case may be for what is truly the best concert doc of all time, there’s no doubt that this film rocks. The Setup: Brynn (Kaitlyn Dever) finds solace within the walls of the home where she grew up until she’s awakened one night by strange noises from unearthly intruders. Review: Right up front, I will say this is a very effective home invasion thriller featuring some extraterrestrial edge. If anyone plans to go in blind, now is the time to watch this film, as it’s pretty solid and features some neat surprises. For those still here, the minor spoiler is part of the conceit of this film – there’s no dialogue. We watch Kaitlyn Dever providing a pretty excellent performance as a town outcast dealing with aliens invading her home, and not a word is spoken. It’s a curious choice from director/writer Brian Duffield, whose witty screenplays and strong directorial debut, Spontaneous, certainly benefited from the dialogue-heavy attitudes of his characters. Fortunately, this only shows proof of a filmmaker with a good handle on genre filmmaking. As for the UFOs and the aliens that come out of them, while not without some quirks, the actual plot delivers only so much innovation. That said, the efforts to produce empathy in a non-mainstream movie way allows for a more interesting than expected third act, with a weirdly fitting wrap-up. One to save and check out when possible. The Setup: A satire that portrays Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet (Jaime Vadell) as a 250-year-old vampire seeking death., but the vultures around him won’t let him go without one last bite. Review: In the realm of infamous dictators, Pinochet ranks pretty high, especially given his lengthy tenure as the ruler of Chile. Looking at his past work, director Pablo Larraín clearly has many thoughts regarding Pinochet and Chile’s political history. That makes it especially interesting to see him venture into darkly comedic territory for this fantastical idea that Pinochet was actually an aging vampire. That doesn’t stop El Conde from being a particularly gruesome and weird feature. That said, it’s not quite as psychologically probing as his recent efforts with Jackie and Spencer, nor does it hit upon the ironic detachment so effectively seen in Jim Jarmusch’s Only Lovers Left Alive. Still, that doesn’t mean the film lacks in its own sorts of entertainment, particularly when watching the various people closest to Pinochet attempting to figure out the next steps. Of course, the film’s greatest asset is Edward Lachman’s gorgeous black and white photography, whether we witness this ancient vampire indoors or soaring in the night sky. The Setup: The Bishop Sycamore Centurions find themselves playing a nationally televised football game on ESPN in 2021. However, questions after the game reveal that Bishop Sycamore isn’t a real school at all. Review: These days, it’s hard to be surprised by the lengths grifters can go to achieve success. Just looking at 2016 America and beyond shows the effectiveness of a professional con artist when they pull all the right strings. With that in mind, the saga of Bishop Sycamore High School is one of the wilder forms of bamboozlement I have learned of, specifically because of the man behind it. Roy Johnson, the man behind BS High, is clearly someone who wants to get ahead by any means, as well as a habitual liar. That’s not just me responding to the angle this compelling documentary takes. Johnson is portrayed as one who proudly details how he played all the angles to create a fake school to essentially get a lot of attention at the cost of exploiting many young men with aspirations of being football players. There are plenty more details to go with that basic idea, which are wonderfully detailed with many interviewees throughout this doc. If anything, directors Martin Desmond Roe and Travon Free almost seem too caught up with Johnson’s audacity to work more towards providing a more explicit critique of his methods. With that said, when someone is laying it all out so clearly, the audience can either rightfully see someone for who they are or fall for the same propaganda. The Setup: A biopic about Jose Hernandez (Michael Peña) and his path from a farm worker to becoming an engineer and an astronaut. It is a tale of perseverance, community, and sacrifice to accomplish a seemingly impossible dream. Review: If there’s a sub-genre I’m often critical of in terms of its structure and tropes, it’s the biopic. What A Million Miles Away manages to do is allow me not to care. Director Alejandra Marquez Abella is not reinventing the wheel as far as the approach to telling Jose Hernandez’s story, but she’s also avoiding some of its larger traps. Much of that comes from the nature of this story, as it’s another example of how representation in film allows for interesting approaches to familiar ideas. While designed as a PG, family-friendly movie, getting an understanding of the life of a migrant worker, let alone some clear portrayals of institutional racism, makes much of the drama hit as well as it needs to. Of course, on top of all this is the winning lead performance from Peña, who makes it nearly impossible not to like this guy. We accept his dream and want him to succeed. There’s admiration that comes from the longevity of the path he must take to achieve it, given that most will know at least part of the outcome of this story. It means a lot to have the right lead providing the right kind of energy into that performance, and even if that doesn’t mean the film is out of this world for all, it’s still a noble journey to watch. The Setup: Desperate to fit in at school, Sam (Megan Suri) rejects her East Indian culture and family to be like everyone else. However, when a mythological demonic spirit latches onto her former best friend, she must come to terms with her heritage to defeat it. Review: This was a frustrating miss. I can certainly admire a film that lets South Asian filmmakers and performers put forward a horror story rooted in Hindu folklore while serving as an analogy for the immigrant experience. It’s just a shame that almost nothing about the execution worked for me. Shot with an intent to scare, it sadly felt like writer/director Bishal Dutta kept hitting short of the right key to properly lock in on being an effective supernatural thriller, let alone a film with the proper weight given to its broader themes. The characters felt hollow, the story borrows plenty of elements from other similarly spooky features without feeling as though it’s trying to branch off in its own unique direction, and the symbolism never excelled past being heavy-handed. I’d be more than fine enjoying a film focused on a second-generation, young immigrant woman dealing with depression, but when even the basics aren’t very satisfying, I didn’t feel as though I wanted to live inside any longer than I needed to. The Setup: Director Robert Rodriguez is back with his Spy Kids franchise for the next generation. Spy suits. Safe houses. Super-cool gadgets. When Patty (Everyly Carganilla) and Tony (Connor Esterson) discover their parents (Gina Rodriguez and Zachary Levi) are secret agents, it’s time to become kid spies-in-training to save their parents, beat the bad guys, and save the world. Review: While they vary in quality, I’ve maintained a soft spot for Rodriguez’s desire to balance his more hard-hitting action-thrillers and crime flicks with homemade, family-friendly features. The first couple of Spy Kids movies benefited from not only their imagination but genuine quality, given the casting and enjoyable level of cleverness. The previous follow-up and films like The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D were less impressive. And now, following the successful and enjoyable Netflix release of We Can Be Heroes, it sadly feels like there’s just no more fresh ground to cover with this latest Spy Kids. Relying on elements from all four previous films, including the plot of the first, the skeleton armies of the second, and the video games of the third, this is a tired re-hash not made any better by new kid actors in the lead roles who don’t click the same way the originals (Carmen and Juni Cortez, respectively) did. There’s a bit of charm coming from Levin and Rodriguez as the parents. Still, they too don’t have anything on Banderas and Gugino. At least the fourth film benefited from some thematic work connected to Rodriguez’s own life. With ‘Armageddon,’ there’s nothing on this film’s mind, and the DIY aspect that allows other Rodriguez films to shine feels similarly worn. Sorry spies. The Setup: Reuniting as the team of elite mercenaries, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, and Sylvester Stallone are joined for the first time by Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson, Megan Fox, Tony Jaa, Iko Uwais, Jacob Scipio, Levy Tran, and Andy Garcia. Armed with every weapon they can get their hands on and the skills to use them, The Expendables are the world’s last line of defense and the team that gets called when all other options are off the table. But new team members with new styles and tactics are going to give “new blood” a whole new meaning. Review: For a franchise that has never really lived up to its potential, it’s kind of amazing to see it find new lows. One can sacrifice campy charm if the action is well-handled. Similarly, if we’re coming up short on seeing what a bunch of alpha males (and the occasional female) can offer in a fight, at least they can get buy on spirited comraderies. Expend4bles lacks both in one of the cheaper-looking $100 million movies I have seen. Stallone saw this entry as a way to hand it over to Statham, and it shows, given his minimal efforts to inspire as his least memorable franchise character, Barney Ross. Statham’s Lee Christmas at least gets plenty of time to shine, as the film’s latter two acts primarily function as a film about him, while the other Expendables are left to their own devices (which involves being led around by Fox for some reason, getting caught and imprisoned for a chunk of the film, and eventually dishing out some poorly edited action). We also, once again, get to see The Raid’s Iko Uwais’ talent wasted in another American film, but at least Tony Jaa gets some time to shine. As a series I’ve never had much fondness for, the results here are none too surprising, but perhaps this film’s current box office failure can lead to scaling down and hiring some of the great DTV action talents the John Wick franchise has been happy to utilize. Surely those stunt performers and martial artists aren’t expendable."
"Sep 26, 2023",NEUTRAL," Cheating, cutting corners, lying, and hurting others don't pay off. Destruction begets destruction. What results in more positive outcomes are telling the truth, playing fair, and treating others respectfully. Kids can sometimes outsmart adults, especially in video games and other tech-savvy areas. Despite her young age, Patty teaches her brother and parents a lesson in integrity by showing them that playing fair, being honest, and treating others kindly will always bring better results than lying, cheating, or unnecessary violence. Ray Kingston is an example of this -- he's only destructive because his father was destroyed unnecessarily. Tony prioritizes winning and playing video games over all else, at first. Kids outsmart their parents and sometimes lie to or disobey them. Patty and Tony work together as a team, as do their loving parents. The main characters portray a loving, smart, and successful Latino family. Some Spanish words are thrown into dialogues, and one scene has the kids recite their very long names -- they have more than just the customary mother's and father's last names. Kids are often participants in the violence and are sometimes victims, but bad guys are cartoonish characters from a video game world, and it's clear the starring family will come out fine in the end. Having said that, young children do find themselves in all kinds of potentially fatal situations, and kids and parents have to watch each other get hurt or be put in danger. This could prove intense for very young viewers. There are falls, sword fights, slaps, chases, crashes or near-crashes, apparent electrocutions, hackings, threatening creatures, and more. Parents need to know that Spy Kids: Armageddon -- part of the kid-friendly Spy Kids franchise -- features some positive messages despite its action violence. These come mostly through Patty (Everly Carganilla), the daughter of the Latino family that's at the heart of the series. She gives her brother (Connor Esterson) and parents (Gina Rodriguez and Zachary Levi) a lesson in integrity by showing them that playing fair, being honest, and treating others kindly will always bring better results than lying, cheating, or opting for unnecessary violence -- and could even bring peace and harmony to the world. Violence is pretty constant, but while kids are often participants and sometimes victims, the villains are cartoonish characters from a video game world, and it's clear that the central family will be fine in the end. Still, young children do find themselves in all kinds of potentially fatal situations, and kids and parents have to watch one another get hurt or be put in danger. This could prove intense for very young or sensitive viewers. Expect falls, sword fights, slaps, chases, crashes or near-crashes, apparent electrocutions, hackings, threatening creatures, and more. Kids also outsmart their parents and sometimes lie to or disobey them. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. Tony Tango-Torrez (Connor Esterson) is obsessed with video games in SPY KIDS: ARMAGEDDON. So much so that he's willing to go around his parents' rules and cheat in a contest to win the latest version of his favorite game, even when his more honest sister, Patty (Everly Carganilla), tries to dissuade him. What Tony doesn't realize is that when he downloads the game at home, he'll allow in an evil game developer (Billy Magnussen) who wants to steal his dad's powerful code, called Armageddon, to control technology around the world. Now, mom Nora Torrez (Gina Rodriguez) and dad Terrence Tango (Zachary Levi) have to reveal their spy identities to their kids to swing into action and save the world. Or will the kids save the day with Tony's video gaming skills and Patty's integrity? There are a lot of young viewers who will probably get a kick out of this latest video-game-themed entry in the franchise where kids always rule. In Spy Kids: Armageddon, the tech-savvy kids outsmart all the adults -- their parents, spy agency chiefs, and even a game designer gone rogue. Parents may find the authority swap a tad uncomfortable, especially because the takeaway seems to be that your kids will only be successful in this world if you give them unfettered access to technology. Perhaps unsurprisingly, that original idea came from director Rodriguez's son Racer, who co-wrote the script with him. Nonetheless, the cast here successfully picks up the mantel from the previous four films in the anthology: Carganilla (Yes Day) and Esterson are adorable and play well off each other, Rodriguez (Jane the Virgin) brings a pleasant earthiness to all her roles, and Levi comes across as a likable cross between Ben Affleck and John Krasinski. What did you think of the video game world of villain The King and his plans for world domination? Did the setting look like video games you've played? What did you make of Tony's line that ""not everyone has to be a gamer""? How about The King's concept that ""anything can be fixed with game theory""?

"Sep 26, 2023",POSITIVE," Spy Kids: Armageddon is not entirelyÂ Spy Kids orÂ Spy Kids: Game Over.Â However, the inspiration that writer and director Robert Rodriguez must have taken from his previous works is noticeable. Taking on a fresh perspective,Â Spy Kids: Armageddon ignores the existence of the previous four films, focusing on the Torrez family rather than the Cortez family. This iteration, likeÂ Spy Kids: Game Over, acknowledges the importance and impact that video games have had on the world. While not every line or plot point is directly taken from the original films, there are plenty of easter eggs and references to the previous movies. Many beats and story points work very similarly to the originalÂ Spy Kids as well, and this is a bad decision when it comes to creating something original and new. While it may work for viewers who have not seen the original Spy Kids, which may be the demographic anyway, it does not prevent anyone from watching it and realizing that far too many elements were ripped out of the original movie, slightly altered, and given a narrowly new approach without the same heart and soul that came from the original film. Newcomers Tony and Patty are nothing like Carmen and Juni, which is one of the main reprieves when it comes to a different sibling dynamic. This version of the kids avoids the constant bickering and insults that Juni and Carmen tend to throw at each other. However, it also avoids granting the characters the same development that the originals got. Spy Kids makes it clear early on that Juni gets easily nervous and is not exactly known for his confidence. Throughout the film, Juni grows more into himself, growing his self-confidence as he has no one other than himself and Carmen to rely on until they find their parents. Meanwhile, Carmen and Juniâs age difference helps portray Carmen as Juniâs annoyed older sister. She is growing up and tired of having to watch after him. Spending time alone with her brother in the field of trying to save their parents allows the duo to learn to work together as a team, rather than against each other while offering both of them individual character arcs and development. Patty and Tony do not get the same treatment. While the movie makes the good decision of avoiding turning the new kids into repeats of the original characters, they are not well-defined enough to provide a substantial character arc. Instead, their values are fairly one-note. Patty believes in fairness and honesty, while Tony uses tricks and cheats to get his way up until the moment that he knows doing so could end the world. Even the parentsâ relationship inÂ Spy Kids: Armageddon does not get the emotional investment and mystery that the originals had earned very quickly into the first film with the story of how a duo of enemy spies fell in love. Spy Kids: Armageddon is fun enough to sit through for a light-hearted adventure. However, it does not portray the substance, dangerous stakes, and complicated highs and lows that the original Spy Kids offered. Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved.

"Sep 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Twelve years after the last Spy Kids movie, Robert Rodriguez goes for a full reboot. It's just as cartoonish, with wacky effects and an absurd plot. But the cast is hilariously up for it, delivering funny zingers while diving into the physical chaos. "
"Sep 26, 2023",NEGATIVE," Jack-of-all-trades filmmaker Robert Rodriguez reboots his signature kiddie franchise with Spy Kids: Armageddon (now streaming on Netflix), which refreshes the story and cast but sticks with the same formula and creative team. And by “creative team,” I mean Rodriguez, who, as usual, does a lot of it himself – he’s the director, editor, cinematographer and producer, and co-writes with his son Racer Max. Zachary Levi (Shazam) and Gina Rodriguez (Jane the Virgin) replace Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino as the mom-and-dad secret superspies, and the titular siblings formerly played by Carmen Cortez and Juni Cortez are subbed out for totes-adorbs newcomers Connor Esterson and Everly Carganilla. The goal here is likely to introduce new, younger eyeballs to the Spy Kids adventures, while also appealing to Millennials’ nostalgia; but for those of us who don’t fall into those demographic categories, it may be tougher sledding. The Gist: Tony (Esterson) and Patty (Carganilla) make their way through a weird temple that looks like an Indiana Jones set if it was a circa-1999 video game. They’re all decked out like spies – black clothes, boots, gadgets, etc. – as they hop hither and thither and walk on ceilings and all that. And then they get in an elevator, but a trap door opens beneath them, plunging them into darkness. Oh farts! That’s not good! But now we jump to ONE DAY EARLIER, because this is one of those movies that opens with an exciting thing then jumps back to the mundane things and works its way back to the exciting thing, so we don’t get bored and turn off the TV and go solve world hunger or something. It apparently only takes 24 hours or so to become a kick-butt spy, because these regular kids aren’t Spy Kids yet. No, their obsession is a new video game called Hyskor (say it out loud – get it?), but their parents, Terrence (Levi) and Nora (Gina Rodriguez), limit their screen time like total tyrants. Being a kid is really tough sometimes, yo. There are some character dynamics here we need to talk about. First, the kids don’t know their parents are spies; Terrence and Nora just haven’t summoned the courage to tell them yet. And Tony is a little poop who cheats at card games and repeatedly defies his parents – he’s a classic don’t-ask-first/just-apologize-later type. By contrast, Patty stands around and says funny things. The plot begins when the family hops into the family car, a prominent brand of automobile that’s the primary subject in at least three shots. It’s so sleek and shiny, this particular vehicle! Just get an eyeful of that logo! You can just SENSE what a smooth ride it has, and how easy it is to obtain low-APR financing! Too bad a QR code doesn’t pop up on screen so you can buy one right now! Where was I? Right – the plot. Terrence created a terrifying piece of software dubbed the Armageddon Code, which can hack any piece of computer technology that exists. That doesn’t sit well with Nora, possibly because she saw Oppenheimer, and she urges him to destroy it before it falls into the wrong hands. Which is exactly what happens, of course; the disgruntled creator of Hyskor, Rey “The King” Kingston (Billy Magnussen), snatches it and throws the whole world into chaos by forcing people to play his video game and achieve certain goals before they can do normal everyday stuff like use an ATM or unlock a door with a touchpad. Egads, I say, egads. All this means the jig’s up on Terrence and Nora’s secret-spy status. Why? Because the movie isn’t called Spy Parents, dummy. And lord knows adults suck butt at video games, so Patty and Tony have to become spies so they can use their gamer skills to help vanquish The King. At this point, I have to pose the question: Will they succeed? And the answer to that is, SORRY, NO SPOILERS.  What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: Looks like the tech-that-could-destroy-the-world plot is going to replace the multiverse narratives as a movie storytelling trend – we already saw it in the Fast and Furious and Mission: Impossible movies.  Performance Worth Watching: This kiddie fare does no one any favors. But it does serve to remind one that Gina Rodriguez is very good in Kajillionaire and Annihilation.  Our Take: One is tempted to soft-pedal criticism for Spy Kids: Armageddon, considering its target audience is still in the early stages of brain development. But the best family movies exhibit effortless cross-generational appeal that this one lacks. Its attempts at comedy are grating and tiresome, the action is forgettable, the dialogue witless. You can’t help but wonder if Rodriguez stages numerous sequences within a retro-video-game world so he has an easy excuse to levy at anyone who might point out that the CGI is shoddy and cheap-looking. The filmmaker has a reputation for efficiency, but the consequence of that is visually uninspired stuff like this (and his recent action movie for adults, the miserable Hypnotic), which looks like mediocre TV from the early-2000s oh-boy-widescreen! era.  Rodriguez struggles to maintain a smooth pace, which stems from the writing, which feels dashed-off; the story consists of, by turns, talky exposition-heavy dullness and action-packed chases and swordfights and the like. The performances are broad and cheerful, at the service of low-impact, sitcommy characters. Give this stuff a little dramatic tension and momentum, and it might go further, and we might not start feeling the drag at the 60-minute mark. Bottom line: The less discerning you are, the more it’ll work for you, which is an at-best dubious compliment."
"Sep 25, 2023",NEUTRAL," Hispanic Heritage Month (Sept. 15 – Oct. 15) celebrates Hispanic and Latino history and culture, so it’s the perfect time to introduce children to Robert Rodriguez’ beloved franchise’s newest entry “Spy Kids: Armageddon.” Directed by Texas-based Rodriguez from a script he wrote with his now-grown son Racer Max – and another son, Rebel, composing the music – it begins with OSS (Organization of Super Spies) secret agents Nora Torrez (Gina Rodriguez) and Terrence Tango (Zachary Levi) whose precocious children – Patty (Everly Cargailla) and Tony (Connor Esterson) – have already tapped into their genetic sleuthing genes. Sneaking around in their device-laden, sleekly contemporary glass-and-steel home to try to snag extra computer time, Tony is so obsessed with the popular video game Hyskor that he will even resort to cheating to win. On the other hand, his sister Patty insists on total honesty. But when Tony accidentally helps unscrupulous game developer Rey “The King” Kingston (Billy Magnussen) unleash a potentially deadly computer virus that will allow him to control all technology around the globe, he and Patty must dive into the Hyskor video-game-world, battling robotic adversaries, to retrieve what’s been stolen from their parents. Robert Rodriguez’s original “Spy Kids” was released in 2001, starring Carla Gugino & Antonio Bandaras with Daryl Sabara &Alexa PenaVega as their kids. Since then, there have been four additional “Spy Kids” installments, including this. FYI: Hispanic and Latino are often interchangeable terms used to describe Americans with diverse Latin American and Caribbean ancestry. The month-long celebration honors their resilience and determination for independence."
"Sep 25, 2023",NEUTRAL," This piece was written during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Without the labor of the writers and actors currently on strike, the series being covered here wouldn’t exist. Spy Kids: Armageddon revives the Spy Kids franchise for another adventure, capturing the spirit of the original and capitalizing on nostalgia but failing to add anything particularly new or noteworthy to the series. The film is the first official reboot of the series, introducing an entirely new family of spies. The new spy kids are tech-savvy Tony Torrez-Tango and Patty Torrez-Tango. Together, Tony and Patty are forced to become spies to save their parents, Terrence Tango and Nora Torrez, and stop a game developer from taking over the world with a global computer virus. Spy Kids: Armageddon is an entertaining film. All these years later, there’s still something so enjoyable about watching pint-size spies living out every child’s wildest dreams. Additionally, the film avoids all the pitfalls plaguing the franchise’s last film, Spy Kids: All the Time in the World. Primarily, it doesn’t scrimp on the special effects or delve into too silly of territory and features pretty strong acting. Connor Esterson and Everly Carganilla genuinely steal the show with their adorable and authentic performances. They capture the child-like wonder, innocence, and occasional hilarious snarkiness wonderfully. Zachary Levi and Gina Rodriguez also give strong performances. Although they portray relatively flat, stereotypical parents, they do the best with what they’re given and have a few compelling moments as the sweetly embarrassing, madly-in-love, quirky couple. The story isn’t particularly captivating, as it’s largely the same story viewers have seen played out before, just with a different family and slightly different villain. Meanwhile, the villain’s storyline isn’t particularly unique or intriguing. The film finds the perfect balance of silliness. It’s enough to amuse older audiences and enrapture younger viewers, but not so much that it drowns out the plot and acting. Mainly, the silliness captures the fun side of the spy genre and embraces the fact that this genre can get a little zany and ridiculous with its endless technology and fancy gadgets, such as wedding rings with a hidden compartment of sleeping potion. Like its predecessor, it embraces silly, family-friendly, wholesome fun while capturing a family’s bond and not being afraid to depict parents who can stand to learn a thing or two from their kids. However, Spy Kids: Armageddon adds nothing particularly new to the franchise. It’s the same nuclear family, same story, and same silliness, which is okay but keeps it from being very groundbreaking. The special effects are decent, but they should be better. Over a decade has passed since the last film, during which a lot of technological advancement has occurred, so the graphics should’ve shown a more drastic improvement over the past films. Similarly, with it being a completely different time than 2011, one would’ve also hoped the film would’ve expressed some new ideas or themes, but it essentially rehashed the franchise’s main ideas. Another disappointment was that the film seemed to lose some of its celebration of Latino heritage. The Spy Kids films were always notable for bringing Latino heroes to the forefront of pop culture. Meanwhile, the films were always filled with little references and family dynamics that celebrated the family’s heritage. The family is biracial in Spy Kids: Armageddon, so the Latino representation isn’t wholly washed away. However, aside from a few things, like the kids giving their seemingly endless full names at one point, there’s definitely not as much of that celebration or acknowledgment that the other films had. At the same time, it may be too stringent of a reboot. The film almost seems afraid to really add something more to the franchise, to the point it even stifles some of the progressiveness of the originals.

"Sep 25, 2023",POSITIVE," NOW STREAMING! Robert Rodriguez and his son Racer Max have partnered as co-writers in the latest Spy Kids installment. Rodriguez is most known for his action-fueled ideas, wacky family films, and a recent brush with a galaxy far, far away via Book of Boba Fett. Spy Kids: Armageddon is a relaunch and fifth installment of the classic early-2000s spy comedy franchise. Picking up where past ventures left off, this packs plenty of slick gadgets and a wacky premise geared toward younger viewers. Once again, when the grownups have exhausted all efforts, sometimes you need a kid or rather a spy kid to save the world. Terrence (Zachary Levi) and Nora (Gina Rodriguez) are typical parents to two pre-teens. They try to balance work with life, raise their kids, and make sure their kids don’t spend too much time on technology. But, unbeknownst to their kids, Terrence and Nora happen to be international spies. Tony (Connor Esterson) and Patty (Everly Carganilla) are two bright kids who love video games and have no suspicions of their parents’ life of espionage. That is, until the launch of a new video game that threatens to unleash the “Armageddon Code” on the world. Before Tony and Patty realize what is happening, it’s time to suit up and become the newest Spy Kids. The “Armageddon Code” launch brings back a familiar Spy Kids troupe. Evil henchmen attack the family’s home and capture the parents, leading Tony and Patty to a safe house/spy lair. At the spy lair, the two kids learn about the OSS and how to be a spy from the book, “How to be a Spy” (as seen in previous Spy Kids films), and a fun crash course in covert operations. After some practice spying, the kids realize the villain may be the creator of their favorite video game, Rey “The King” Kingston (Billy Magnussen). When Kingston attacks the OSS headquarters, it’s up to Tony and Patty to rescue their parents and stop Kingston. James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez did something that I wish had happened a long time ago. That is to the big screen a “Disney”-princess-type story but... NOW ON NETFLIX!

"Sep 25, 2023",POSITIVE," Robert Rodriguez’s 2001 original was iconic. He built a children’s movie around exactly what he knew kids wanted to see: themselves as the heroes of the kinds of exciting genre movies the adults were watching. In Spy Kids, children aren’t tagalongs or mascots — they get to save their parents, play around with fancy spy gadgets, and do all sorts of cool, exciting things. With two direct sequels focused on the same characters, a soft reboot/kinda sequel in 2011, and a short-lived 2018 animated Netflix show, the Spy Kids franchise is already familiar with new additions. Still, fans of the first Spy Kids might wonder if Netflix’s new reboot film could ever match the highs of the original movie. The answer is simple: If you were a kid when you first watched Spy Kids, of course the new one won’t feel the same. But that’s OK, because Spy Kids: Armageddon recaptures the magic for a new generation. It’s meant first and foremost for viewers discovering this series for the first time.  Rodriguez is still acutely tapped into what makes movies exciting for kids. The elements of the original that were so evocative — the gadgets, the training, the campy special effects — are all back in his revamped movie. While Armageddon’s adult cast isn’t as captivating as Carla Gugino and Antonio Banderas were in the first movie, Rodriguez and his son Racer, who co-wrote the script, deftly expand their focus this time out, giving the latest Spy Kids movie a timely message.  Like the original Spy Kids, Armageddon follows two kids — this time out, Patty (Everly Carganilla) and Tony (Connor Esterson) — who discover that their parents are secret agents. As with the first movie, their parents get kidnapped by a supervillain, and they have to step into the big spy shoes to save the day. This time around, the kids are a little younger and way more tech-savvy, even though their father is super strict about their allocated screen time. Instead of the villain being a beloved children’s TV show personality, he’s a video game creator who the kids look up to. It’s a smart update for a generation more tapped into the gaming world.  At first glance, the movie’s basic outline matches the original Spy Kids almost beat for beat. But for each moment that feels like a direct copy, there’s another with enough of a twist or subversion to keep the plot fresh. Those curveballs also make it obvious that the filmmakers are conscious about their homages. Their clear awareness of Spy Kids history and willingness to step beyond it takes Armageddon past uninspired-remake territory and turns it into a deliberate series of nods to the original movie’s special moments.  The ways Armageddon leans on the original film do make the biggest discrepancy between them more jarring: The adult cast in the new movie is subpar. Zachary Levi and Gina Rodriguez make for decent spy parents to spy kids, but they don’t have nearly as much suave charm as Banderas and Gugino, who, as actors, ooze “We were actually secret spies in another life.” Billy Magnussen can pull off the role of a cocky game developer, but he’s nowhere near as engaging as Alan Cumming’s playfully unhinged villain turned ally Fegan Floop. The supporting cast also never rises to the heights of Danny Trejo, Tony Shalhoub, and Teri Hatcher in the original — they all blend together into a bland background blob.  But the Spy Kids franchise is fundamentally about the kids, not the adults. In that regard, Armageddon does hold its own. The new characters are much younger than Carmen and Juni were in the original, which helps the actors carve out their own direction and dynamics. A lot of Carmen and Juni’s relationship is built on tension, with Carmen outright bullying Juni. But Patty and Tony have a different conflict: Patty’s a rule-follower who would rather be honest and kind than sneaky, while Tony is mischievous and doesn’t mind playing a little dirty. Their different personalities play well into the ways they take to becoming spies.  As for the spy antics, they’re as fun as ever. It’s still exciting to see the kids in high-stakes car chases, messing around with funky gadgets, and entering a video game to save the world. Rodriguez still leans on dynamic set-pieces with funky 2000s vibes. (There’s an excuse for it built into the movie.) The action isn’t as bright and colorful as it is in the older movies, but there’s still a homebrewed charm and big imagination to the villain’s kooky hideout and the family’s safehouse, and it’s all emblematic of Spy Kids Energy and its zany aesthetic. The biggest difference between this new Spy Kids and the original is the thematic focus. The original was very much about the core family patching up their relationships. Carmen and Juni start off as antagonistic siblings, but as Juni builds confidence and Carmen nurtures her understanding, they form a strong rapport. Meanwhile, the parents learn to trust each other and their kids. Eventually, they come together as a family, culminating in a reunion when Uncle Machete crashes through a window.  But Rodriguez is an expert at integrating bigger themes into these movies. The original Spy Kids deals with self-esteem, secrets, and trust. Each successive Spy Kids movie has built out the scope of the world and its ideas, and now Armageddon comes in with a big, sweeping message about focusing on rehabilitation instead of punishment and incarceration, in the spirit of encouraging people to do better. Come for the fun gadgets and the kids saving the world, and stay for a message about recovery and kindness, delivered so earnestly that it isn’t saccharine at all. "
"Sep 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"  The spy kids are back… again. Spy Kids: Armageddon is the fifth installment of the Spy Kids franchise following 2011’s Spy Kids: All the Time in the World. This time, we meet a new spy family out to save the world. Nora Torrez (Gina Rodriguez) and Terrence Tango (Zachary Levi) are currently the world’s greatest spies for the OSS, and they are the parents to Antonio ""Tony"" Torrez-Tango (Connor Esterson) and Patricia ""Patty"" Torrez-Tango (Everly Carganilla), who are unaware that their truth-preaching parents are lying to them about being spies. The whole charade comes crashing down on them when Tony accidentally helps a game developer unleash a potentially deadly computer virus through his advanced video game. Now, the kids must suit up and save the world via a virtual reality video game. And no, this is not Spy Kids: Game Over.   Spy Kids: Armageddon follows some overly familiar beats. We have a family that is part Latinx — Gina Rodriguez carries that torch, with Zachary Levi as her partner and father of her children, each of whom harbors opposing personalities. The children, just like Carmen and Junie, represent their parent's cultural backgrounds. Only Spy Kids: All the Time in the World broke this formula, though the visual dynamic of the family remained eerily similar. And just like every film before it, Armageddon has the kids, who have been bamboozled all their short lives, suit up to become spies to save their parents, who have been captured by some evil entity. The familiarity continues with the story, with Rodriguez, inspired by his children's ideas, revisiting the video game angle with the big bad, who uses the extremely popular pastime to take over the world. Rodriguez felt the need to address the state of video games 20 years after his biggest Spy Kids film — Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over — and, in fairness, a lot has changed with how video games and technology impact our lives.   The movie is broadly fun, despite it being visually flat and far too artificial looking for its own good, but there has been a notable improvement in the CGI since the days of Game Over. The movie is maybe 20 minutes too long, however, but with the cute children carrying the movie with semi-endearing dialogue and a hearty message for the younger generation to take in, Armageddon earns a solid B in holding our attention. The key to such a movie is balancing the visual spectacle with a charismatic cast to carry the ridiculous premise. Spy Kids: Armageddon partially succeeds with the visual aspects, but fumbles the bag when it comes to casting and writing.   The kids are precocious enough, but they aren’t given new or interesting material; they're just reworking the dynamics the OG spy kids had. Rodriguez and Levi are big, notable names, but neither hold a candle to the charisma and chemistry of Carla Gugino and Antonio Banderas. Admittedly, we should recognize now that their steamy romance will never be replicated in a children's movie, thanks to the cultural shift where adults apparently having personalities and lives outside of being just parents is wrong for children to see. Here, Rodriguez and Levi are ostensibly the opposite of Gugino and Banderas; they possess roommate energy. The light sprinkle of Latine music that is queued up for Levi’s grand entrance expects us to make some subconscious connection to the smoldering hot spy Banderas played, but it only induces laughter from embarrassment. Needless to say, the casting here is bland, which does the flat script no favors. Ultimately, Rodriguez cannot break from the archetypes and formula that he perfected in the original trilogy, as we now have back-to-back sequels that cannot recapture the witty, zany, yet heartfelt fun of the original films and the charm of its original cast.   Robert Rodriguez is responsible for crafting some pop culture hits. As maligned as The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl is, it doesn't negate the fact that it has been a staple of many people's childhoods. When we look back at it, it's with fondness. There is a reason he revisited that with We Can Be Heroes. Spy Kids was a phenomenon, becoming one of cinema's most influential trilogies. It isn’t always highly regarded or considered one of the best, but its cultural impact outpaces many critically acclaimed trilogies. So, it's very disappointing to witness Rodriguez circle the drain with redundant additions that don’t add anything to the Spy Kids experience. As noted before, Armageddon follows that same formula but is catered to the iPad-wielding generation of kids who would enjoy the original regardless of its age. It’s silly, fun, and enjoyable but lacks the texture and vitality of the original film.   Spy Kids: Armageddon is creatively deficient. With each new Spy Kids project, Rodriguez mines an empty cave; there is nothing but dirt and hopeless dreams. We live in a nostalgia-obsessed era, so there is no reason for Spy Kids to be impacted. But no matter the generation, Spy Kids will always be entertaining and nostalgic as it is timeless. Will Spy Kids: Armageddon entertain the children of today? Sure. But Rodriguez and co. should aim higher and move away from franchise building. As Rodriguez has already given us a lot of great entertainment for kids and families, fresh ideas are the only way to meaningfully expand his brand within children and family entertainment. We Are Heroes, the standalone film that was also a legacy sequel to The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl, is an example of taking two steps forward and one step back, but it was at least a step in the right direction. With new material, Rodriguez can have a mega-hit like Spy Kids again. Unfortunately, he is stifled by the same flat ideas and repetitive choices right now.  The Matrix is rightly considered one of the most influential sci-fi action movies of all time, but some aspects of the film haven't held up. The 3-day opening weekend projections for the Dune: Part Two box office show the movie earning a total that the original only earned after two weeks."
"Sep 23, 2023",NEGATIVE," While one can appreciate the idea that a talented filmmaker with style and edge would turn his attention to children’s films, and the Texas-based studio he founded to shoot them in, a new Robert Rodriguez “Spy Kids” installment always gives me a case of, “Awww, dude.” As in “Aww, dude, ‘Hypnotic’ wasn’t all that bad, and there are all those cool credits you accumulated before it — ‘Sin City,’ ‘Once Upon a Time in Mexico,’ going back to ‘Desperado’ and ‘El Mariachi.’ But another movie with kiddie spies and spy gadgets?” This latest reboot gets made-for-Netflix money, so many Troublemaker Studios gets a little more in the black. But even though the messaging is upbeat, the video game villain has Muskian overtones and it finishes well, it lacks the Spanglish spark that made the original films so much fun. Gina Rodriguez isn’t a bad swap for Carla Gugino as the new “mom” who is a spy. But Zachary Levi is nobody’s idea of Antonio Banderas. He isn’t even his usual jovial self, here, thanks to a script so PG it’s like the “P” was washed right out of it.  And all the colorful villains and actors playing them from the past films hang over Billy Magnussen’s turn as Rey “The King” Kingston, the video game mogul who wants to cheat-code, hack and reboot The World.  Everly Carganilla is Patty and and Conor Esterson is Tony, the two “kids” who have no clue Mom and Dad work for the OSS. No, not THAT OSS.  The parents, Nora Torrez and Terrence Tango, are ordered to fend off whoever is trying to steal this “Armageddon Code.” They find themselves battling villainous figures based on Aztec warriors and Spanish conquistadors, with some Heck Knight as the ultimate foe. They don’t figure out they’re straight out of a video until they’re already hostages. Their kids, meanwhile, have escaped to the “Safe House” lair where they finally put the “Ah, they’re SPIES” thing together. This digitally-advanced lair offers Spy Training lessons via tutorials rendered by their digitized parents. I also laughed at the pass code the kids have to recite to enter the lair. Aw, man, NOBODY in the Spanish speaking world wants to give their ENTIRE name to anyone.  There’s novelty in their “find another way” around violence conflict resolution messsaging, the effects are excellent, if not quite at a Marvel level at the moment and it finishes well.  But bland leads, a story that feels similar to many other “Spy Kids” adventures and the paucity of colorful supporting players  kind of washes the Spanish/Spanglish fun right out of this most Tex-Mex of kids’ franchises. "
"Sep 23, 2023",NEUTRAL," In an era of the neverending list of cinematic universes and reboots, it’s no surprise Robert Rodriguez decided to revive his beloved kid-friendly franchise for a direct-to-Netflix release.  Spy Kids: Armageddon is the fifth movie from the series, and it was co-written by Rodriguez and his son, Racer Max.  If you’re even remotely familiar with the original series, you probably know the premise: Two super-spy parents hide their top-secret jobs from their precocious children. One day, the parents are in trouble, and it’s up to the kids to train as spies and save the day.  Spy Kids: Armageddon centers on OSS agents Nora (Gina Rodriguez) and Terrence Torez (Zachary Levi) and their children Tony (Connor Esterson) and Patty (Everly Carganilla). While Tony likes to lie and bend the strict rules on technology Terrence imposes on the kids, Patty believes in honesty and integrity. Both kids are avid video game players, specifically the games designed by Rey “The King” Kingston (Billy Magnussen). When the kids sneak out of their rooms one night to play The King’s latest release, they accidentally give him access to the Armageddon key – a powerful code that allows him to hack into any device on the planet. And what does The King do with this power? He gamifies the entire planet. People now have to play and win The King’s video game before they can access their devices for the most mundane of tasks like paying for parking or checking their bank balance.  Now, the Torez kids must stop The King before his rather creative changes destroy the world and force the adults to learn how to play video games. Spy Kids: Armageddon is a rather tired rehash of all the other Spy Kids movies, which weren’t that great in the first place. However, this one is way worse.  As bad as the special effects are, the plot is rather repetitive, and some of the generational difference tropes don’t make as much sense in 2023 as they would have two decades ago. For example, millennials grew up playing video games, so the Torez parents being this clueless about how to play doesn’t add up.  The performances are terrible. The two kids are adorable, and they do add a bit of charm to this charmless feature, but most of the adult cast members look like they would have rather stayed home watching paint dry than appear in this film.  This is not a good movie. It looks cheap, and AI could have written the script based on a synopsis for the first four installments. If you liked the 2001 Spy Kids movie and want a dose of nostalgia, you’re better off watching that one.

"Sep 23, 2023",NEGATIVE," Directed by Robert Rodríguez.
Starring Gina Rodriguez, Zachary Levi, Connor Esterson, Everly Carganilla, D.J. Cotrona, Billy Magnussen, Joe Schilling, Robert Rodriguez, Solar Dena Bennett, Fabiola Andújar, and Neal Kodinsky. The children of the world’s greatest secret agents unwittingly help a powerful game developer unleash a computer virus that gives him control of all technology, leading them to become spies themselves to save their parents and the world. This piece was written during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strike. Without the labor of the writers and actors currently on strike, Spy Kids: Armageddon wouldn’t exist. It is a stunning realization that Robert Rodriguez’s Spy Kids: Armageddon (a resurrection of the series that fashions the legacy children spies as a modern-day married couple played by Zachary Levi and Gina Rodriguez, now with kids of their own but still secretly working missions) is also co-written by his 20-something-year-old son, Racer Rodriguez (who received a story credit for The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D before he was 10 years old), considering how bygone the story and visuals feel with its video game-centric plot and influence. One would presume someone on the younger side like that would have their fingers closer to the pulse. This is ostensibly a kids’ movie, which is fine (no one is expecting storytelling greatness here), but that demographic most likely is not going to understand jokes about the Nintendo 64 James Bond first-person shooter classic GoldenEye, or antiquated game structures such as beating “levels” rather than exploring vast open worlds (which is all the rage in the current landscape of the industry.) It could be argued that this is part of the point since the narrative involves Patty and Terry Tango-Torrez running into a wall, reaching their operative limitations when a celebrity game developer hacker (Billy Magnussen) steals half of the titular Armageddon program, a digital hacking device that can infest and unlock any technological device. To their credit, Zachary Levi and Gina Rodriguez occasionally have funny comedic delivery and lines. All electronic devices have been restricted through a firewall, forcing users to complete a video game task in Rey ‘The King’ Kingston’s latest popular fantasy game (which is embarrassingly generic and could very well be inspired by Dark Souls or one of its offshoots, except for the fact that there is nothing here that would remotely suggest the filmmakers know what those games are) before access is granted. Naturally, the adults struggle to overcome these challenges, whereas the children drive (which feels backward and ageist in a world where older males and females are gamers, but that’s putting too much thought into something simply striving to be silly and fun.) Nevertheless, Patty and Terry’s gamer children Tony and Nora (Connor Esterson and Everly Carganilla) end up at a safe house where they discover the true occupation of their parents, practice on a training course with spy costumes, and set off to save their parents locked up in an underground lair (essentially meant to be a final boss dungeon.) Admirably, this story puts into question the principle of spies and whether or not lying is necessary, not to mention whether or not something as technologically powerful as the Armageddon code should exist. Unfortunately, the film fails to capitalize on the tantalizing wacky premise of a world where everyone must interact with a video game to use technology or interestingly explore why The King has chosen this method for world domination (his reasoning starts silly and only gets clichéd and dumber.) Although the script from Robert and Racer Rodriguez is awkward, outdated, and seemingly ignorant as to what modern-day gaming is like, subsequently letting down their child actors (who are endearing and cute nonetheless), a far bigger issue is that, as the story continues to become more action-oriented and embrace this fantasy world, the CGI is everywhere and monumentally hideous. The last 30 minutes are filled with so many unconvincing special effects that the movie may as well be a video game from the early 2000s. Aside from the fact that the clear target demographic of children is probably not going to be entertained or fall for a film that’s trying too hard to appeal to them, they are also not stupid and will recognize a false representation of modern-day gaming and nerdom (an important secondary component of this game are trading cards, which don’t seem to be popular at all anymore). Movies have historically failed at accurately portraying video games and the characters playing them on screen, but there is a crippling problem when it feels fake, and the entire film is grounded in that activity. Perhaps Spy Kids: Armageddon will be the end for a series that maybe shouldn’t have been given a Phoenix Down (see, now I’m referencing old games in a movie featuring modern gaming.)"
"Sep 22, 2023",NEUTRAL," “No One Will Save You” is a wildly original and well-made sci-fi entry on Hulu from filmmaker Brian Duffield. Kaitlyn Dever gives a remarkable, nearly wordless performance as troubled young woman who is confronted by aliens at her isolated rural home. It’s a twisty and innovative thriller with more depth than you might expect. You probably knew that the late Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was a monster. But did you know that he was also a vampire? That’s the premise of the bizarre Netflix feature, “El Conde,” from acclaimed filmmaker Pablo Larrain. It’s a grisly, blood-soaked, pitch-black political critique that plays like something Ingmar Bergman may have made while stoned. “El Conde,” which is Spanish for “The Count,” is an overwrought arthouse satire attempting to drive a stake into the heart of the Pinochet legacy. The horror entry “It Lives Inside” is yet another demonic possession movie, but with one unique angle. Megan Suri plays an Indian American teen battling social pressures and prejudice who also winds up battling a demonic spirit from Hindu mythology. “It Lives Inside” is well executed and creepy but is a by-the-numbers story that plays it a little too safe. The Netflix adventure thriller “Spy Kids: Armageddon” is the fifth feature in the action-comedy franchise from filmmaker Robert Rodriguez. It’s essentially a reboot of the over-the-top adventure series that pits some junior James Bond types against an evil game developer who bears a strange resemblance to Elon Musk. “Spy Kids: Armageddon” is loud, frenetic, and repetitious. Even the youngsters might be bored."
"Sep 22, 2023",POSITIVE," Spies, demons, and… theater kid chaos? Pop Culture Planet’s Kristen Maldonado breaks down the movies you want to watch this week — and the ones you don’t. The new horror film It Lives Inside follows a Sam, a teen who rejects her East Indian culture and family to fit in at school. But when a mythological demonic spirit latches onto her former best friend, she has to come to terms with her heritage to defeat it. After supporting roles in Never Have I Ever and Missing, I was excited to see actress Megan Suri take center stage in this film, but unfortunately the cast tries to do a lot with nothing. The set up to the story is weak and the “horrors” feels more like a random chain of events. They don’t dig deep into their culture or the impact of this demonic spirit. An underwhelming and disjointed film, It Lives Inside will leave you feeling disappointed after the success of original horror films as of late. The Spy Kids are back… but is the new movie good? Spy Kids: Armageddon finds the kids of the world’s greatest secret agents accidentally helping a powerful game developer unleash a computer virus that gives him control of all technology. Now they must become spies themselves to see their parents and the world. The premise is cute and very reminiscent of Spy Kids meets Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over. They’re going back to the roots, but also adding these gamer elements and it has a lot of fun Easter eggs. Did you catch the nod to the “How To Be A Spy Book” by Author Unknown? It’s great to see the kids are at a higher advantage when it comes fighting off this villain because they knew more about gaming and technology than their parents. I also liked the messages of truth and kindness over cheating. While this wasn’t the greatest film of all time or even capture the magic of the original trilogy, young kids will enjoy it and people who grew up with the franchise will be able to share it with their families. Robert Rodriguez continues to be a beacon of light for Latino representation and even brings his whole family together to write, direct, producer, and even soundtrack this film.  When the beloved founder of a rundown theater camp in upstate New York falls into a coma, its up to her bro-y son and the eccentric staff to keep the camp afloat in Theater Camp. This movie will have you laughing through the whole thing. I loved how it was simultaneously a self-deprecating satire of the theater community but also a love letter to that same audience. The whole film is perfectly cast. Broadway veterans like Ben Platt and Noah Galvin bring an authenticity to the story, while Jimmy Tatro does a great job of bringing the humor for those who might not be theater kids. This film is for everyone and definitely surprised me by just how good it was. It brought me back to the joy and nostalgia of my own theater kid days. You can really see the love they put into this project, including Molly Gordon and Platt’s real life Stagedoor Manor theater camp home videos adding to the film’s credibility. This is the next generation’s Camp and you don’t want to miss a second of it. Looking for the perfect theater kid double feature? Watch Theater Camp on Hulu, followed by 2003’s iconic Camp that gave actors like Robin de Jesús and Anna Kendrick their start.

"Sep 22, 2023",NEGATIVE," TEXAS, USA — Per movie law, once we see the good guys in the fifth and latest ""Spy Kids"" outing using a tool called the “armageddon code” to hack their way past obstacles, it's only a matter of time before it falls into the wrong hands. You know it. Franchise overseer Robert Rodriguez knows it. Zachary Levi and Gina Rodriguez sure aren’t doing much to disguise it as the latest pair of covert-operative parents who can only do so much to maintain a clean work-life balance before their mission eventually loops in their oblivious kids, Tony (Connor Esterson) and Patty (Everly Carganilla).  Such is the way things roll in these “Spy Kids” films, which have always functioned as the family-friendly B-side of genre wish fulfillment to Rodriguez’s bloodier, raunchier material. Will the San Antonio-born filmmaker ever lean all the way in and give us a team-up of Carmen Cortez and El Mariachi? It remains to be seen. But at the very least, another “Spy Kids” movie keeps the dream alive, even if “Spy Kids: Armageddon” shamelessly echoes prior installments from the tykes’ inexplicably quick transformation into death-defying operatives to the thinly veiled sentimentality and off-kilter aesthetics that suggests Rodriguez once had a videogame controller in his hand while dreaming up the elevator-pitch concept driving the whole thing. That’s especially appropriate for “Armageddon,” it turns out. For the second time in three ""Spy Kids"" movies, the story explicitly tunes into children's allure with videogames and fashions an industry giant (Billy Magnussen) into the villain who threatens the creation of a world that can only be navigated if you’ve got prowess with a joystick. It’s a silly enough idea to buy into for 90 minutes (though nowhere near as gleefully loony as the 3-D-augmented antics of “Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over”), and does just enough to nicely reinforce the franchise’s core conceit by building the stakes around something that baffles parents but which comes as second nature to Tony and Patty.  This kind of thing seems to come as second nature for Rodriguez, too; it’s a bit uncanny how he delivered this gumball caper just a couple months after his violent and mind-bending thriller “Hypnotic” made approximately $47 in theaters. “Spy Kids” is destined for a bigger audience simply by virtue of its platform – it released on Netflix Friday – though at the same time it’s hard not to see “Armageddon” (written by Rodriguez and his son, Racer Max) as a parody of whatever imitators might have been born in the wake of his original early-2000s trilogy. Those surprisingly enjoyable movies boasted a better harmony between silly and sincere, as well as a Cortez family unit which you could believe knew each other for years before stepping in front of the cameras, and not mere moments.  “Spy Kids: Armageddon,” by comparison, is like a gadget trying to relocate the spark of a moviemaking era the franchise was always going to work best for: that awkward moment in the CGI transition when everything looked just a little off, and in such a way that matched unexpectedly well with the world of “Spy Kids,” which itself always felt gloriously just a little off from the start.  The dialogue here wavers between squeamish and competent, though that’s less a sign of a phoned-in script than one eager to get to the weirdness these movies tend to provide. There’s some of that, too, in the form of digital foes stylized as ancient Mayan warriors and Ray Harryhausen-esque henchskeletons who chase our young heroes through busy streets. But the movie’s structure and barely formed soul signals a franchise limited by its own potential where once it might’ve been a gateway to the even weirder, wackier stuff the DIY-happy Rodriguez was once inspired by. "
"Sep 22, 2023",NEGATIVE," It has long been a matter of diminishing returns with the “Spy Kids” series for years. While the 2001 original was an enjoyably lively demonstration of Robert Rodriguez’s infinite resourcefulness, subsequent installments have felt stale and grating. These are movies for families and sometimes by his family, as the Austin-based auteur often likes to include his own kids on camera and behind the scenes. The “Spy Kids”-adjacent “The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D” from 2005 reportedly sprang from the imagination of his then-seven-year-old son, Racer Max, who received a writing credit. But families deserve better than the cheap-looking and cloying reboot of the franchise, “Spy Kids: Armageddon,” now streaming on Netflix and playing theatrically in limited release. It’s more of the same, without any discernible improvement in quality, despite the massive technological leaps over the past two decades. Rodriguez’s original claim to fame was his ability to accomplish a lot with a little, wearing various hats at once. Here, he once again serves as director and co-writer (alongside the grown-up Racer Max) as well as producer, cinematographer, and editor. The result is a movie that will appeal only to very young kids; even for that audience, there are too many preferable options. “Spy Kids: Armageddon” has the exact same premise as the first movie in the series: The parents are secretly spies, and when the kids find out, they have to spring into action and save the day. Zachary Levi and Gina Rodriguez step in for Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino as new characters, Terrence Tango and Nora Torrez. From their hidden lair inside the family’s sleekly modernist glass-and-steel home (the coolest part of the movie, by far), Terrence and Nora tinker with an all-powerful Armageddon code. While playing his favorite video game, their son, Tony (Connor Esterson), inadvertently unleashes the code to brilliant tech billionaire Rey “The King” Kingston (a weirdly bland Billy Magnussen), who plans to use it for nefarious purposes. Now it’s time for the eager Tony and his smart-alecky sister, Patty (Everly Carganilla), to spring into action and save the day and the world. Levi and Rodriguez seem as bored by the material as we are, while the young actors do their best to bring enthusiasm to their banal banter. There is exactly one clever idea in this movie: That the code becomes a virus requiring people throughout the globe to play a video game to fulfill mundane tasks like taking money out of the ATM. Mostly, “Spy Kids: Armageddon” alternates between frantic slapstick antics and people standing around explaining things to each other. Chintzy green-screen effects turn something as simple as a car chase down Austin’s Congress Avenue into a distracting mess. The lighting often has a flat sameness, regardless of the situation. Because this is a spy movie, there are, of course, gadgets galore, but even those aren’t terribly inspired. A bit involving giant fly swatters quickly grows repetitive, for example. And the whole endeavor feels about 20 minutes too long, with no compelling sense of pacing. The action drags, and then all of a sudden, it’s chaos. Somewhere beneath the mayhem is the celebration of Latino pride that has infused Rodriguez’s films from the beginning, with his ultra-low-budget indie “El Mariachi” from 1992. Tony and Patty must recite their entire names to gain access to an underwater safe house as a reflection of their heritage. These fleeting touches are welcome and make the movie feel personal. And what little kid hasn’t played a make-believe game in which they’re the hero? “Spy Kids: Armageddon” takes that basic sense of good vs. evil and whips it up into a shrill, annoying frenzy.

"Sep 22, 2023",NEUTRAL," After
more than a decade-long hiatus,
co-writer/director/cinematographer/editor/co-composer Robert Rodriguez has
brought back the idea of kid spies with Spy
Kids: Armageddon. It's just too bad the lengthy pause didn't result in the
fun of the series' first two installments. This
reboot does at least have some fun with its central concept, even if it is
something of a familiar riff on the third entry of this franchise. The story
here is all about kids' relationship with and humanity's increasing reliance on
technology, as the developer of the world's most popular video game uses his
most recent creation to force people to play a video game in order to access any
device. Since just about everything can be ""smart"" and connected to
the internet, that means adults, who don't keep up with all of the games their
kids are playing, are locked out of their homes, cars, and bank accounts. Somehow,
this is supposed to make people better in their everyday lives, although the
villain isn't exactly clear as to how this act of global hacking or even his
line of thinking would do such a thing. Forget that, apparently, because
Rodriguez and Racer Max's screenplay really only cares about putting two young
siblings and their spy parents into a series of adventures, action sequences,
and opportunities for stealth and gadget-use. We know
the drill by this point, and apart from some enjoyable performances and a couple
of smart messages about what it means to be a decent person, this new start for
the series doesn't live up to the franchise's high points. It is a bit better
than its low ones, though. The new
family of spies or soon-to-be spies are the quartet of brother and sister Tony
(Connor Esterson) and Patty (Everly Carganilla), as well as their parents
Terrence (Zachary Levi) and Nora (Gina Rodriguez). Mom and dad are long-time
spies, but they still haven't told their kids this information. Nora
really wants to, but Terrence is paranoid about what it could mean and the
possibility of their identities being uncovered. That means limiting the kids'
tech-time and locking up all of their devices whenever they're not supposed to
be using them. Rebellious Tony won't stand for that, and after winning a free
copy of the sequel to his favorite video game, he and Patty sneak into the
family game room late at night to start playing. This
sets in motion a lot of chases, some hiding, plenty of fights with assorted
goons, and a race against the clock to stop the bad guy from taking control of
every piece of technology on the planet. Our villain is Rey ""the King""
Kingston (Billy Magnussen), a game developer who figures out the parents' job,
determines that Terrence has created a program called the Armageddon Code that
can hack into anything, and uses Tony's secret game-time to steal half the code
from the parents' spy computer. When he realizes his plan is incomplete,
Kingston abducts the Terrence and Nora, leaving the kids to fend for themselves
in a high-tech safe house, train to become spies, and come up with a plan to
rescue their parents. On the
positive side, the child actors portray a sense of fun that might overshadow the
worldsboth that of spies and of the gamer's paradise Kingston has made of his
secret fortressand action envisioned by Rodriguez. Levi, as an equally strict
and goofy father, and Rodriguez, as the tough but caring mother, neither feel
out of place nor dumb down their performances for the kids on screen or in the
audience. There's a pleasant feeling of authenticity to this familyalbeit
with some embellishments, since it is going more for comedy than sincerity. The
main issue is that Rodriguez doesn't seem too interested in doing anything
different or new with this installment, either in terms of its predecessors or
when it comes to any given comedic action movie. The main hook, perhaps, is how
much of this story revolves around video games, with Kingston's henchmen being
characters from his creation (They're either guys dressed up as them or the real
deal brought into reality, but it's not as if the filmmakers care about the
rules of this world or that any rules would really matter in the first place). That's
taken to another couple levels during the third act, as the kids infiltrate the
villain's fortress, which shifts to accommodate the occupants and to create
assorted perils, and the foursome go inside the video for a string of final
challenges. The visual effects, which only look a bit updated from even the
first film, get the job doneif said job is look like a cheap and cheesy video
game, which very well might be the intention, all things considered. The
result is, though, a bunch of generic action. Despite the seemingly endless
possibilities of high-tech spy tools, it comes across as limited, until the
third act, when Spy Kids Armageddon
wants to give us a lesson on the importance of non-violence. After everything
that comes beforeas in, immediately up to that message being acted uponit,
that seems more than a bit hypocritical."
"Sep 22, 2023",POSITIVE,This is exactly what you would expect the film to be&#46;&#46;&#46; Better than the last one but not as good as the original trilogy&#46;
"Sep 22, 2023",NEUTRAL," Robert Rodriguez is single-handedly responsible for crafting the childhood of so many kids growing up through the late 90s and 2000s. Movies like El Mariachi, Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn, and Once Upon a Time in Mexico ran on a loop in every house (including mine). But due to its violent content, you had to keep switching between channels to avoid getting caught watching some of the risque scenes. In addition to that, there were the Spy Kids movies, which truly captured the imagination of how children would see themselves as superheroes. Yes, they’ve been criticized for their janky visual effects and CGI, but that didn’t stop them from being nothing short of modern classics, especially Spy Kids 3: Game Over. Rodriguez went on to make several films, TV shows, and music videos. However, for the first time since 2003, it seems like he has sat down to converse with Game Over through Spy Kids: Armageddon. Robert Rodriguez’s Spy Kids: Armageddon, which he has co-written with his son Racer Max, follows spy couple Nora Torrez and Terrence Tango. They work at the franchise’s iconic spy agency, the OSS (Organization of Super Spies), under the jurisdiction of Devlin. Terrence and Nora heavily rely on an all-purpose digital key called Armageddon, which can unlock anything in the world, but they monitor their children, Tony and Patty, especially when it comes to their use of electronic devices. But since Tony is a big fan of video games, he keeps finding ways to get access to his devices and play Loskor, which is game developer Rey ‘The King’ Kingston’s most popular product. Tony also has a habit of playing dishonestly because he thinks that the world is an unfair place. He cheats to get a chance to play Rey’s latest release, Hyskor. However, that video game ends up being a ploy by Rey to get a hold of the Armageddon so that he can make the whole world dance to his tunes. The Spy Kids movies can seem like they aren’t high on themes as they are largely aimed at kids, but the franchise’s very premise is very forward-thinking: adults fumble, and kids one-up them every step of the way. I don’t know if this is the case because Rodriguez came up with these movies during the IT boom, where millennials were getting high-paying jobs right after finishing their education and earning more than their boomers, or if it’s just something instinctive, but it’s quite inspiring. Much like the previous films, Rodriguez incapacitates the parents pretty early on in Spy Kids: Armageddon, thereby forcing the kids to put the problem-solving skills they’ve acquired from video games (something that the parents hate) to the test. Since tech-savvy billionaires make up for the majority of real-life villains, The King has a certain degree of relevance as he holds the world hostage after forcing everyone to adapt to his technology. He has the money to “cure” the world, but he takes this obtuse way to implement it. That said, much like his predecessors, The King isn’t a villain; he’s an antagonist because his execution is incorrect, but his intentions are good. The King in Spy Kids: Armageddon very much feels like an updated version of The Toymaker from Spy Kids 3. Since it was the 2000s, in that movie, Rodriguez did the cliche thing of saying that videogames are bad, that they corrupt the minds of children, and that it’s better to stay in our physical reality than lose yourself in a virtual reality. It’s 2023, and virtual reality and video games have become more mainstream than ever before. So, through the rivalry between Patty, Tony, and The King, Rodriguez seems to be retracting that statement while keeping things relatively wholesome. He isn’t saying that we should totally embrace virtual reality because the stuff that’s analog always comes in handy when everything else fails. Instead, he’s saying that video games and augmented reality can be educational and reformative, if they’re in the right hands, of course. However, if one wants to get educated and set off on the path of self-correction, then they can’t take shortcuts because the results will be incomplete and, hence, pointless. The honest route will be tedious and challenging, but the results will certainly be satisfying and long-lasting. And that’s an important message for kids as well as adults, to be honest. A lot has been said about Robert Rodriguez and his specific visual style, especially when it comes to his kid-friendly movies. Look, the guy made the Sin City movies with Frank Miller. So he gets a lifetime free pass. In addition to that, Rodriguez’s use of VFX and CGI in those two movies is proof of the fact that nothing in the Spy Kids movies is unintentional or a result of budgetary restraints. They look the way they do because that’s what Rodriguez and his team want. Although Spy Kids 3 is lambasted for its visuals, you have to be an idiot to not realize that the film accurately replicates the aesthetics of video games from the 2000s. And it seems like Rodriguez is unfazed by the criticisms, as he says through The King that visual effects peaked in the 2000s. I have to agree with him because the push for photorealism and utter lack of eccentricity are getting boring. Meanwhile, Rodriguez is here, making me nostalgic about Revenge of the Sith by setting his final battle on a lava river with a version of Carmina Burana’s “O Fortuna” playing in the background. Heck, Knight looks unrealistic and yet great. The action choreography, the songs, and the pacing are impeccable. It’s fun! When it comes to the performances, the bar was set too high by Alexa Vega, Daryl Sabara, Antonio Banderas, and Carla Gugino. All of them were so likable and charismatic that it made the viewing experience so enjoyable and memorable. Zachary Levi and Gina Rodriguez do not commit to the act. They seem to be too aware of the fact that they are in a made-for-kids movie. They are right on the brink of looking at the camera and winking at us, which isn’t a good sign. Billy Magnussen, who is far more restrained than them, fits right in. There’s no sense of irony, and it seems like he truly believes that his games can change the world, and that makes it a good performance. The movie rests on the shoulders of Connor Esterson and Everly Carganilla, though, and they truly knock it out of the park. Their sibling chemistry is truly off the charts. Esterson effortlessly portrays Tony’s conniving nature and his transformation into an honest individual due to Patty’s advice. Everly essays Patty’s aversion towards dishonesty really well. And the ease with which she shows up the adults is simply hilarious. I know that the movie is a reboot, but I did miss the signature Danny Trejo cameo. I’m sure Rodriguez has his reasons. In conclusion, Spy Kids: Armageddon is an expectedly fun romp with a relevant message about video game culture and the uptick in the use of augmented reality. I know that Rodriguez usually has his hands full, but I sincerely hope that he gets to shape the imagination of a new generation of kids with this new chapter of the Spy Kids saga. It’s a shame that, unlike the first four films, this one’s not releasing on the big screen and hence can’t be enjoyed by the community. I hope that kids as well as adults do watch the film on Netflix because there’s something in it for everybody. Additionally, I hope that major studios look at Rodriguez’s films as they fiendishly wait out the strikes happening in Hollywood and learn that it’s better to let directors express their unique visual style instead of making everything look fake in the name of photorealism. Anyway, what you have read is just my opinion. Please check out Spy Kids: Armageddon for yourself, form your own opinion, and feel free to share your thoughts with us."
"Sep 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"  This review was written during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Without the labor of the writers and actors currently on strike, the film being covered here wouldn't exist.Over two decades ago, Robert Rodriguez introduced millennials to spycraft and Thumb Thumbs with his upbeat quartet of Spy Kids films, which embraced familial bonds and the potential children have to save the day through the optimism that only they possess. These hopepunk themes have carried over into Rodriguez’s other kid-friendly action comedies, like The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl and its subsequent star-studded Netflix sequel We Can Be Heroes, and permeate through the delightfully schmaltzy Spy Kids reboot Spy Kids: Armageddon.   Beyond the OSS (Organization of Super Spies), Spy Kids: Armageddon seems largely disconnected from the previous Spy Kids franchise, paving the way for Netflix to explore the story further with a new cast of characters and entirely different stakes. In addition to rebooting the series, Rodriguez has re-teamed with his son, Racer Rodriguez, who notably crafted the story for Sharkboy and Lavagirl at the tender age of seven. While the younger Rodriguez has long since aged out of the film’s target audience, he and his father still seem perfectly capable of crafting heartfelt family fun.   Armageddon’s parental units lack the scorching-hot chemistry that Antonio Banderas and CarlaGugino brought to the original trilogy, but Zachary Levi and Gina Rodriguez do make a very sweet couple as Terrence and Nora Tango-Torrez. They smooch and swoon and operate as a rock-solid spy couple made even better by their precocious children Patty (EverlyCarganilla) and Tony (ConnorEsterson) who are the very best of them. Levi and Rodriguez are quite charming, though they are merely secondary characters to the young leads.   Rodriguez doesn’t spend a lot of time building up their family dynamic, opting instead to throw the audience head-first into the thick of things, and it works in its favor. Especially with the subtle hints and clues about the family, which are paid off in the final act in very fun ways. With the children front-and-center, the script lets Patty and Tony take the lead, fleshing out how the family operates through their snark, sibling drama, and feelings towards their parents. Rodriguez has always placed his faith in the children he casts in his films and hasn’t been led astray yet. He keeps finding talented pint-sized actors who outshine and outfox their adult counterparts.   The cast of good guys is rounded out by D.J. Cotrona, who previously starred in Rodriguez’s short-lived From Dusk Till Dawn reboot series and opposite Levi in the Shazam! films, who appears as OSS leader Devlin. There isn’t much to his character, by design, but Cotrona has fantastic comedic timing, especially when he’s being one-upped by Patty and Tony.   There are two key pieces of technology at the heart of Spy Kids: Armageddon’s plot—the Armageddon Code, which the Tango-Torrez family has possession of, and TK, the hot new video game taking over the world. Literally. A powerful game developer named Rey “The King” Kingston (Billy Magnussen) has noble intentions, but they’re totally obscured by his desperation to prove that his game can save the world if only everyone would play it. It’s a very hokey and ill-contrived powerplay, but it’s perfectly on brand with the sort of supervillains Rodriguez has crafted in his previous Spy Kids and Sharkboy and Lavagirl films.   Spy Kids: Armageddon might be action-packed, but there’s nothing inherently violent about the battles that Patty and Tony get involved with. Sure, there are swords, shields, and axe-wielding skeletons, but they’re hardly real threats to the children, and those lowered stakes won’t detract from the thrills aimed at the younger demographic watching. Parents might find themselves rolling their eyes at how easily the villains are undone—especially when their undoing is quite literally kindness, but that’s what has always made Rodriguez’s films so compelling for their target audience. Rather than pushing the visuals of ultra-violent fights, like the video games that inspired Armageddon’s big-bad, the film opts to encourage children to be good, be true, and seek out restorative justice for their enemies.   While nothing will ever compare to the hilarious fear that Thumb Thumbs instilled in an entire generation, there’s something uniquely perfect about Rodriguez’s chosen villain in Armageddon—a tech boy gamer with daddy issues who thinks he can save the world with his video game systems. With a new tech-fueled generation to cater to, Rodriguez is smart to create a villainous scenario that is more nebulous than past Spy Kids foes. It speaks to the target demographic, who are naturally gifted with video games, unlike their adult counterparts, even if they also played video games, once upon a time.   Spy Kids: Armageddon may never be the generation-defining cult classic that its predecessors were, but it is still a long-overdue return to an unparalleled universe. In Rodriguez’s world, hopepunk rules, and very few storytellers feel compelled to tell stories where there’s unwavering optimism and hope for the future. The children in his world might inherit cool talents from their parents and be given unbelievable tech, but they always manage to save the day through their own innate abilities and the wisdom that comes with viewing the world through the eyes of a child. It’s a rare and beautiful thing amidst a cinematic landscape filled with nihilism, superheroes, and a need to be connected to powerful names.   So long as you aren’t expecting a masterpiece, Spy Kids: Armageddon proves itself as a fun, spy romp, where kids are king and parents are simply along for the ride. It’s childhood wish-fulfillment to the extreme, straight down to getting to live out video game fantasies and one-hit wonders. It achieves exactly what it sets out to be, even if the road to that success is lined with goofy, cartoonish villains, easy wins, and too-smart children saving the day.

"Sep 22, 2023",NEGATIVE," It’s been almost fifteen years since there was a new “Spy Kids” installment and one of the last times Robert Rodriguez released a film in theaters (he’s apparently locked in to Netflix like Adam Sandler). Sadly, these days Robert Rodriguez seems more committed to delivering low budget kid accessible entertainment more than anything else, and “Spy Kids: Armageddon” allows him to kill two birds with one stone. Not only is he able to continue his line of mediocre family films, but he gets to revive his long stagnant action franchise for a new generation. Siblings Patty and Tony Torrez are the children of Nora and Terrence, two of the world’s greatest secret agents. After they unwittingly help powerful game developer Rey Kingston unleash a worldwide computer virus that gives him control of all technology, Patty and Tony train to become spies themselves in order to save their now captured parents, as well as rescue the world from living under Rey’s perpetual video game. It’s pretty clear by now that Rodriguez isn’t making his movies for all audiences, as he’s aiming mainly for the streaming audiences between the ages of 8-11. And it shows as he co-writes the movie with his son Racer Rodriguez. That’s both a pro and a con, as while Rodriguez has insight in to the younger mind set, the movie often sounds like it was written by a twelve year old. The dialogue is often stagnant and you can just feel the actors trying to force out clumsy interplay and attempts to muster up tension. As I mentioned, so much of “Spy Kids: Armageddon” is a mixed bag. There’s so much to like about the movie, but there’s also so much that keeps it from reaching the bar that the original trio of movies set. So much of the plot feels old hat and recycled from previous films. We’ve seen so much of these plot elements and spy gags before and to a better degree with the goofy weaponry—correction: “Gadgets,” as well as the obligatory robot sidekick. There’s also the villain who is a rotten master gamer, which we pretty much saw in “Spy Kids 3D.” While Billy Magnussen is threatening in his own right, Stallone just did it better. Also, Rodriguez is a fan of the same tired story formula. It’s always an affluent nuclear family that takes on a bad guy who is usually a petulant, childless man baby who is always evil because of some deeply rooted resentment toward the spy family or just kids in general. Rodriguez has yet to explore the out of the ordinary family. There are families out there with one parent, mixed race parents, interfaith parents, and often kids can be raised by their aunts and uncles, or grandparents. I’d love to see Rodriguez spotlight a family where the kids realize that their grandfather who raised them is a world famous spy like James Bond or something. The whole sense of self awareness is also completely gone, in favor of more sugary wholesomeness that does everything to evade any sense of danger. The original film had Danny Trejo training the kids, and now it is goofy computers. That said, the special effects are neat, and I enjoyed a lot of the goofy monsters and robots that Rodriguez hurls at us at almost lightning fast speeds. His monsters and villains tend to be pretty inventive all things considered. It’s pretty obvious “Spy Kids: Armageddon” just isn’t meant for me, but in the end it’s not Rodriguez’s worst film. I just wish he’d retire the formula and start thinking of introducing different kinds of families he can expose his young audience to. It’s a big world out there."
"Sep 22, 2023",POSITIVE," It’s been 20 years since Robert Rodriguez performed a one-of-a-kind feat that was unique in large part because it wouldn’t occur to anyone else to try: He capped two different trilogies in the span of about two months, chasing his kid-franchise capper Spy Kids 3: Game Over (just under the wire for his stars’ impending teenage growth spurts) with the decidedly adult Once Upon a Time in Mexico. Finally, the prolific writer/director/producer/editor/cinematographer/composer could rest – meaning, in this case, wait less than two years before unleashing another discount-Spielberg double feature consisting of a family film and a more violent, grown-up offering. But 2005 was the last time we got a Rodriguez single-year double feature until now, as he follows up his little-seen sci-fi noir Hypnotic with the reboot Spy Kids: Armageddon (a previous one-off reboot/part four was released in 2011). It’s tempting to say that Spy Kids: Armageddon is to Rodriguez’s kid-targeted movies as Hypnotic is to his grown-up stuff: A modest, entertaining, halfway-return to not-quite-form; something silly that will benefit from low expectations. And that’s largely true. It is most of those things. But while Hypnotic derived some novelty from what it didn’t much resemble in Rodriguez’s filmography – a 1940s B-movie noir in color, featuring a contemporary movie star with a complicated public image – this Armageddon has clearly been brought about by Spy Kids past. We once again meet a pair of boy-girl siblings: Tony (Connor Esterson) and Patty Tango-Torrez (Everly Carganilla), whose parents Nora (Gina Rodriguez) and Terrence (Zachary Levi) secretly make their living as ill-defined spies. (Rodriguez has never aimed for junior-level le Carré, and at least Armageddon steps back from the maddeningly abstract ideas about espionage put forth by its predecessor, All the Time in the World.) Once again, the kids have to step up when their parents are incapacitated by a world-threatening supervillain. Beyond this durable premise, Armageddon includes a mom-and-dad fairytale-mission flashback, like in the first Spy Kids; fighting skeletons, like in Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams; and scenes that take place inside a videogame landscape, like in Spy Kids 3 (and, metaphorically, like most of Rodriguez’s movies from the past two decades). These seem like conscious nods to the original trilogy, and most of them have their own little twists on the formula. What the movie fails to pick up is the finer points of its predecessors’ style and, especially, their eye for casting. Not just in the literal absence of the original kids (and the woeful substitution of Zachary Levi for Antonio Banderas), which is to be expected, but in the spirit of packing the cast with delightful supporting players like Danny Trejo, Steve Buscemi, Alan Cumming and Bill Paxton, who all enliven the original trilogy. (Even Sylvester Stallone gave it his best shot in the third one.) That’s not a knock on Billy Magnussen, who plays a game developer who wrests control of the world’s technology – a funny, parent-friendly echo of Terrence’s desire to control his son’s obsessive tech use. He just doesn’t have anyone to play off of; the whole movie feels weirdly underpopulated, with some neat-looking CG figures getting more screentime than the flesh-and-blood actors who typically inhabit Rodriguez’s Austin-shot virtual worlds. The visuals effects on his green-screen-heavy productions are getting better all the time, especially given that they’re intended to be fanciful and kid-friendly, not photorealistic. Yet much of Armageddon looks flat and meager, which is not unusual for a Netflix production, but is a little surprising given the participation of long-standing production companies like Skydance and Spyglass. As with Rodriguez’s previous Netflix kid movie, We Can Be Heroes, the action scenes are more workmanlike than gleeful. Rodriguez made surprising sense as a children’s-movie director because he himself took obvious, kid-in-a-fireworks-factory joy in staging shoot-outs, chases and stand-offs. He can still bring the heat when necessary, as seen in his Alita for-hire gig; Armageddon feels pretty soft-pedaled by comparison. To his credit, Rodriguez does seem interested in evolving, perhaps in consultation of his multiple children who can now co-write a screenplay (Racer Max), work on a musical score (Rebel), or sing the movie’s theme song (Rhiannon). While an early Spy Kids adventure included a lesson about the kids over-relying on their gadgets rather than their wits, this one takes a view of technology befitting the 20-year time jump: It’s just as dangerous to appoint yourself the arbiter of how tech is used, whether it’s forcing the world to play your videogames or insisting that those videogames rot your kid’s brain. Spy Kids: Armageddon also extols the virtues of honesty, whether through parents or children, and nonviolent solutions to problems. After all these years, a Spy Kids adventure can still be counted on for warmth: The lessons are sweet, the kid actors are cute, and the kid audience will probably enjoy it accordingly. Whether it sticks in their memory for 20 years or even a few months, though, is another question entirely. Jesse Hassenger is associate movies editor at Paste.

"Sep 22, 2023",POSITIVE," SPY KIDS: ARMAGEDDON. With Gina Rodriguez, Zachary Levi, Everly Carganilla, Connor Esterson, Billy Magnussen. Written by Robert Rodriguez & Racer Max. Directed by Robert Rodriguez. Rated PG for sequences of action. 108 minutes. On Netflix. SPY KIDS: ARMAGEDDON – the fifth and latest in the kid-favorite franchise  – features all new characters, which makes sense since the original was made more than twenty years ago. What hasn’t changed is the premise: a brother and sister discover their parents are super-spies and prove to be chips off the old block themselves. It’s a pretty silly premise, but if you were eight years old, you might think this is one of the coolest movies ever. Tony (Connor Esterson) and Patty (Everly Carganilla) seem like normal kids, except that Tony believes in cutting corners, whether it’s cheating at a fantasy card game or getting around his parents’ rules on using tech. Patty believes honesty is the best policy, even if it causes trouble. When Tony wins a new video game created by Rey ‘The King’ Kingston (Billy Magnussen), he doesn’t realize he’s letting loose a virus that will subvert most of the tech in the world. It requires people to win online games to do things like unlock their electronic doors or access their ATM accounts. However, Rey wants world domination and for that he needs the “Armageddon Code,” which allows its user to crack every form of computerized tech. The Code is utilized by the spy parents Terence (Zachary Levi) and Nora (Gina Rodriguez) but has been broken in two so that when Rey steals it, he still needs the missing part. It will be up to Tony and Patty to save the day. Director/co-writer Robert Rodriguez manages to do a lot with the material. There’s plenty of colorful action to keep the kids in the audience entertained, without ever getting too violent. For parents, Rodriguez and co-writer Racer Max (Rodgriguez’s son Max Rodriguez) makes sure the kids learn its better to be honest and that actions have consequences. And, continuing in the spirit of the earlier films, he offers Latino representation in the form of the Tango-Torrez family by simply treating it as a fact. Esterson and Carganilla are engaging as the siblings. If they seem too young to accomplish what they do, that’s part of the fantasy of kids succeeding in the adult world. Levi and Rodriguez may not be as well-known as original spy parents Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino, but they exude charm as both spies and parents. Magnussen is the sort of cartoonish villain who won’t give young viewers nightmares even if some of his video game generated minions might. His motivation of wanting to improve the world by forcing everyone to play video games might make no sense to adults, but the kids this is targeted at should have no problem with it. Daniel M.

"Sep 22, 2023",POSITIVE,&#8220;Armageddon&#8221; isn&#8217;t exactly fresh&#44; but it&#8217;s fun to a certain degree&#44; delivering lively entertainment for younger audiences while Rodriguez continues to explore his fascination with greenscreen production achievements&#46;
"Sep 22, 2023",NEUTRAL," For a few late millennials, the Spy Kids franchise has assumed a sort of vaguely remembered, but beloved mantle. I was seven years old when the first film hit theaters or, more accurately for the target demographic, hit a child’s tentpoles of culture – Happy Meal toys, TV advertisements, whatever spy “gear” classmates brought in for show and tell. The movies, particularly the 2001 original, were wacky and grandiose, goofily futurist adventures with cartoonish stakes. If you were a kid, Spy Kids (along with the 2002 sequel and 2003 3D edition) were an ultimate fantasy, with sick gadgets and cool parents (international super spies played by Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino). Spy Kids: Armageddon, Netflix’s reboot of the franchise with the original writer-director Robert Rodriguez, understands the wells of nostalgia it’s tapping, though it doesn’t always reach it. To be fair, it doesn’t really have to; like the original, the 94-minute film is aimed squarely at children. As the ultimate responsibilities (and heroics) fell to Carmen and Juni Cortez (Alexa PenaVega and Daryl Sabara), so too, do world-threatening circumstances demand Tony (Connor Esterson) and Patty Tango-Torrez (Everly Carganilla) step up. The adults, particularly the hapless operators of the spy group OSS, are extraneous. As with the original, the reboot is set in Austin, Texas, where the Tango-Torrezes live unassuming lives in a device-laden pad. Unbeknownst to their children, Terrence (Zachary Levi, tapping into humor from his Chuck days) and Nora (Gina Rodriguez), are active super-spies in possession of the Armageddon code, which has the ability to hack into any device in the world and maybe all of them at once. Tony and Patty just want to play video games and are frustrated by their dad’s strict tech rules. He views their elaborate video game of choice as brain rot; they see it as training. Perhaps the best nod to adults is that the creator of this game, a mercurial, power-hungry tech baron nicknamed The King (Billy Magnussen, not on the level of Alan Cumming’s Fegan Floop but still vulnerable and cartoonishly sinister), reads as a parody of Elon Musk. The King covets the Armageddon code to force every operator and every electronic device to play video games; as experts, Tony and Patty are perfectly positioned to both unlock secret codes and battle the robot video game villains The King unleashes on their household. Thus ensues a cheeky, ever sunny battle for world domination, replete with fantastical tools and located primarily within the King’s retro, chunky polygon-filled video game castle. (“Let them do what they do best: play games,” the OSS chief Devlin says of the kids; everyone gets the signature black shades.) More than two decades since the original, Rodriguez maintains his ability to invoke a child’s sense of adventure and absurdity (though there’s nothing quite as deranged as a Thumb Thumb here); the fantasy of actually being the character in the video, embodying the hero, remains intact. It’s a bit ironic that, for all the franchise’s futurist gusto, there’s considerable magic lost to the procession of movies into Netflix aesthetic and whole-scale CGI. Partnered with Skydance and Spyglass Media Group, Netflix’s Spy Kids demonstrates both the visual ambition and flatness of would-be streaming blockbusters. The King’s castle has video game pleasures – blocks materializing and disappearing into thin air, a platform wobbling along a river of blue and orange lava – but not the older films’ sense of visual depth or silliness. There’s a feeling, especially as the movie barrels toward its final video game-set confrontation, that the playfulness of the Spy Kids ethos is battling the limitations of digital production. That’s the typical devil’s bargain for movie nostalgia – for all the attention it inherently attracts, there’s alchemy and originality that cannot be reclaimed. True to form, the new Spy Kids gestures at old successes, and then sands them down. Not that the new generation, to whom its explicitly marketed, will probably notice. Spy Kids: Armageddon did, at least, remind me of the blind delights of childhood again, and the kids who will likely enjoy this."

Directed by Rodriguez from a script he co-wrote with own son Racer Max, “Spy Kids: Armageddon” is more or less is a modernized remake of the first film (and, yes, with the original film now over 20 years old, there are still things here to modernize). Super-spies Nora Torrez (Gina Rodriguez) and Terrence Tango (Zachary Levi) are attempting to lead a normal life while also being frequently dispatched to save the world, while also parenting kids Patty (Everly Carganilla) and Tony (Connor Esterson), both of whom have developed some sleuthing skills of their own, all the better to sneak around their whipsmart folks.  On the anniversary of Rey’s father’s death, he steals the Armageddon code back from Terrence, who has been using it to infiltrate the tech of evil masterminds for years. Yes, that plot seems eerily similar to the latest “Mission: Impossible” film, and Rodriguez’s feature includes even more winks toward the camera (the kinda that original “Spy Kids” stars Carla Gugino and Antonio Banderas already mastered). Magnussen’s turn as the whiny, evil mastermind is even teased to return in a possible follow-up. Still, two decades on, this “Spy Kids” is more focused on the role of technology in the home (and world) than silly euphemisms between married adults and eye-rolling kids.  With its video games references and exciting spy elements (a super-tech mobile! an underwater safe house! gadgets!), “Armageddon” will certainly appeal to kids today, the kind that fall into the pre-tween age group who still dream about joining the CIA. As spy boss Devlin (D.J. Cotrona) says at the end of the film, it’s simply onto the next mission for the “Spy Kids” family. Will that sequel rival “Spy Kids 2”? Stay tuned.
