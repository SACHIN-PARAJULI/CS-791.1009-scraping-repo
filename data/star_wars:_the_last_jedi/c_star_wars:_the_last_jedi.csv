"Jul 24, 2023",POSITIVE," Synopsis: Luke Skywalker's (Mark Hamill) peaceful and solitary existence gets upended when he encounters Rey (Daisy Ridley), a young woman who shows strong signs of the Force. Her desire to learn the ways of the Jedi forces Luke to make a decision that changes their lives forever. Meanwhile, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) lead the First Order in an all-out assault against Leia (Carrie Fisher) and the Resistance for supremacy of the galaxy. I am an authentic fanboy of the Star Wars saga and I loved its return two years ago when The Force Awakens was released. Everything looked better, sounded better and the story certainly didn't disappoint me. So, obviously, I was extremely looking forward to The Last Jedi. Apparently, critics love Episode VIII but fans not so much. Me, well... I don't LOVE it, but I do enjoy it very much. I do think it is a bit below the previous film's overall quality since it definitely has some issues the first one did not. I am also confident that I know why the fans are not loving this movie and I will explain that after a few paragraphs. This time, I am going to start at the other side of the spectrum. I will begin my review with the film's problems because I do need to get them out of my mind, especially this one... The subplot involving Finn (John Boyega), Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), and DJ (Benicio Del Toro), some of the few new characters added to the franchise, completely ruins the movie's pacing and its narrative is such a tremendous deviation from the main story. It is, by far, the worst issue I have with the screenplay because it does not work as one single problem... it creates a whole other set of them. The first act's pacing is really fast since it starts with tons of action sequences. However, the second act decreases the rhythm and it is more story-driven, full of mystery-unlocking and character-development scenes. Finn and Rose's nonsensical adventure just turns everything slower and even strange. It ends up needlessly extending the runtime (the film could have easily been 15min shorter) and worse... Possibly creating a love triangle with Rey (I am not even going to discuss this). Apart from this major issue(s), I have some minor problems. General Hux is a strong candidate to become the most annoying character in this new-generation trilogy. Gleeson is fine, he actually achieves a good over-the-top performance, but his character is just tumbling off the rails. Also, on a more technical aspect, the writing does not flow as well as it did on J.J. Abrams' screenplay. There are a lot more exposition scenes which also does not help the pacing at all. I wrote earlier about the fans' reasons for them to be disappointed and well, the marketing for the movie did not lie: they do take a lot of chances with this one.  Rian Johnson delivers a lot of twists and shocks throughout the whole runtime and it is impossible to assume that every single one of them is going to be mind-blowing and unanimously accepted. I do not want to give anything away from the plot, so I am just going to write that most of the choices and paths they choose for each character, I either simply accept them or I truly love them. As for the rest, I am, at most, underwhelmed (yet, I trust and understand the decisions they went with). People need to learn how to deal with their own expectations. If you expect something utterly absurd and nonsensical to occur and then it does not, you can't blame the film for not following your crazy idea. So, please, don't start blabbing any movie is bad or disappointing because it didn't fulfill your ridiculously high expectations. Even if they are grounded and thoughtful, you have to embrace the production's approach to the character/story. If it makes sense, then it is as valid as any other theory. It might be underwhelming if you have high expectations, but it is still a serious take on whatever you are thinking.  This is why I think fans are not loving The Last Jedi. The production takes a lot of risks and some of them don't work with everyone, mostly due to fans' radical theories that don't have a place in the film. I think most people might change their initial opinion after a second viewing, myself included. Some things just need more time to process or even a whole rewatch. Since I do not have time to do it before the year's end, I am going with what I have. Switching to the light side, I do enjoy this movie a lot. Every cast member that was great in Episode VII, transcends themselves in this one. Daisy Ridley is superb as Rey. She has such a massive range of expressions and I am sure her successful future as an actress is surely guaranteed. From the most emotional and somber moments to the most epic action scenes, she is awesome. Her character's mysterious backstory reaches a whole new extent and her interactions with Kylo Ren and Luke Skywalker inflict chills all over my body. Mark Hamill's comeback can't be any more amazing than it is. He delivers a fantastic, emotion-full and very compelling performance. It is even more unbelievable knowing that Hamill had strong personal arguments against the director's interpretation of what was better for Luke. If he is this astounding working against his own idea of who his character really is, then I must praise his exemplary working principles. Luke and Rey spend a big chunk of the runtime training on an unknown island and I love every single second filmed on that piece of land. I have to admit that I am a bit frustrated because I think the film should have more time with these two, but due to the issues mentioned at the beginning of my review, the runtime can't be much more stretched. I love what they did with Luke, even if some fans are going to go insane with his journey. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren... The undoubtful star of the whole show. Driver is becoming a menace to every actor working today because he is flawless. He has a powerful, dark, mysterious, compelling, and commanding display as one of the most complex and multi-layered characters of the Star Wars saga. Ren's conflict inside his mind and heart is the most captivating feature of his story and his interactions with Rey are so jaw-dropping spectacular that I can't even describe them properly. John Boyega is once again great as Finn, even though he is part of that horrible subplot. Boyega delivers a convincing performance and Finn shines through some awesome action set pieces. Kelly Marie Tran is actually good as Rose, it is just a pity that her character suffers from the narrative, even though her backstory is pretty touching. Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and the Porgs, the new cute animals implemented in the Star Wars universe, have all the funny scenes plus some action here and there. Oscar Isaac is quite lucky because Poe Dameron unquestionably has the best subplot of the movie. Isaac offers a very passionate display as Poe goes through some significant character development. His impulsive instincts to attack the bad guys always have consequences and he is put in check by Leia during the whole time. It is a very interesting and twistful story that elevates the film's main plot. Carrie Fisher is elegant and beautiful as Leia, a character that has a lot more screentime than what I expected. I always love seeing Fisher on the screen and she makes everything a bit more realistic to me. Andy Serkis is remarkable as Supreme Leader Snoke, but his character is yet another plot's detail that fans are not going to appreciate so much. I still feel underwhelmed by Snoke in this movie for several reasons, but after some thinking, I do understand his role in the film and his moments are indeed intimidating and dominant. Rian Johnson's work as the director is better than his as the writer. The visuals effects continue to be wonderful and the practical settings are beautiful, once again, there is a lot less CGI than you probably think. Excellent cinematography and John Williams' score induces enormous levels of nostalgia and excitement. The action sequences are mind-blowing, the stunt work is phenomenal and there are tons of pure epic and awesome scenes. The main plot includes a very dark and mysterious side to it that I thoroughly love. A lot of unexpected twists and turns make The Last Jedi more original than The Force Awakens, even if one or two plot points might be underwhelming, and it also has a very well-balanced tone. Finally, a thrilling, breathtaking, action-heavy third act ends the film with magnificent glory and with many heartfelt moments. All in all, Star Wars: The Last Jedi delivers something that I can be proud of experiencing. Terrific performances from the cast, but a flawlessly powerful display from Adam Driver as Kylo Ren steals the spotlight. Rian Johnson takes a lot of risks with decisions that will make the fanbase debate for years and while I find most of them truly jaw-dropping, a few left me underwhelmed. The main story keeps its obscure mystery while packing some jaw-dropping, epic action sequences, and excellent character-development scenes. Nevertheless, it departs from J.J.’s visual storytelling, delivering a more exposition-heavy screenplay and some pacing issues bring the movie down, largely due to the unnecessary detour of the subplot involving Finn and Rose. In the end, it still belongs to my top half of the saga, fighting for the 4th spot with Return Of The Jedi and Rogue One."
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE," Rian Johnson's Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an emotionally-driven culmination of all that came before it and an adoring love letter to George Lucas.  In 2015, after a decade of lying dormant, the Star Wars franchise came roaring back to the cinema screens with Star Wars: The Force Awakens. It was a massive success upon release, breaking numerous box office records and getting met with nigh universal acclaim from fans and critics alike. And with that under their belt, Lucasfilm creatives turned their attention to its sequel, Rian Johnson's Star Wars: The Last Jedi. A bolder and infinitely more unique film that capitalized on the solid groundwork laid in the previous movie in massive ways, Johnson's The Last Jedi is a genuine masterpiece.   If The Force Awakens was the result of Abrams' professed love for 1977's A New Hope, then The Last Jedi is the result of Johnson's professed love for George Lucas as a filmmaker. The Force Awakens made a concentrated effort to keep the memories of Lucas' controversially received prequels at bay, deliberately harkening back to the aesthetic and narrative sensibilities of the original trilogy. Conversely, The Last Jedi embraces the entirety of Lucas' saga, Prequels very much included, as well as the films that inspired Lucas in the first place. Films like Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon, Orson Welles' Citizen Kane and Michael Curtiz's Casablanca are just as much a part of the movie's visual grammar as Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers are, with Johnson finding the meaningful ties to these stories present in Lucas' work and elevating them to the forefront.   That is very much a recurring theme in Johnson's work. Despite what some particularly rabid corners of the internet might have viewers believe, The Last Jedi is actually a sublime sequel to The Force Awakens. It takes every development of The Force Awakens' story, from the introduction of new characters to the establishment of core beats like Luke's exile, in earnest and builds organically upon them. Characters like Hux and Snoke, who were little more than Abrams' surrogate Tarkin or Palpatine, respectively, are fleshed out into fully formed characters of their own. The previously plot-driving factor of Luke's exile on Ahch-To is also authentically interrogated and given character motivation and emotional resonance. None of this is Johnson rewriting or trampling over developments from The Force Awakens but rather the opposite, with The Last Jedi elevating these elements with startling clarity and retroactively strengthening Abrams' film.   And it is with this same adoration and articulate eye Johnson approaches the story of the Star Wars saga at large. The Last Jedi builds beautifully upon threads from previous films in a deeply affecting fashion. As Lucas famously said of Star Wars storytelling, ""it's like poetry, it rhymes,"" and Johnson demonstrates a profound understanding of this rhyming stanza. Luke's exile on Ahch-To is deliberately reminiscent of Yoda's exile on Dagobah, with both characters disappearing from the fight entirely in the aftermath of their own perceived failures. In Revenge of the Sith, one of Yoda's final lines is ""Into exile, I must go. Failed, I have"" after he lost his duel with Palpatine. Yoda feels his own hubris led to this destructive result, with nearly all of his students dying and the Jedi Order he oversaw crumbling before him. Luke's arc in The Last Jedi is a rhyme of all of this, down to blaming the death of his students on his own hubris.   But wonderfully, Johnson doesn't stop there. The stanza culminates with Yoda and Luke's conversation, in which Yoda says, ""the greatest teacher, failure is"" and ""we are what they grow beyond."" That moment brings 40-years-worth of storytelling to a head -- bringing Yoda's story from the Prequels full circle, providing an emotional epitaph to Luke and Yoda's relationship in the Original Trilogy and serving as a resolution of Luke's internal conflict across Force Awakens and Last Jedi, all in pure Lucas cinematic storytelling fashion.   The Last Jedi is full of meticulously constructed thematic threads like this that are immensely emotionally satisfying. Rey and Kylo Ren's relationship is a rhyme of Anakin and Padmé's, with Johnson and editor Bob Ducsay cutting their Force connection scenes to invoke both Anakin and Padmé's connection in Revenge of the Sith and Luke and Vader's Force connections at the end of The Empire Strikes Back. Finn, Rose and DJ donning First Order garb to infiltrate the Supremacy is also a rhyme of the original trio's infiltration of the Death Star in A New Hope, used to emotional effect in pointedly challenging Finn's beliefs by reimmersing him into the system of corrupt power. Even Kylo Ren revealing Rey's parentage to her is a rhyme of Vader doing the same to Luke in The Empire Strikes Back, and the reveal itself directly taps into the core thesis of the Joseph Campbell-penned works, which so heavily inspired Lucas.   One of the most impactful instances of this thematic rhyming scheme comes with Luke's final stand at the Battle of Crait. The entire theme of Lucas' A New Hope is that of technology versus spirituality. Luke is put squarely in the middle of this theological conflict, with Obi-Wan on one shoulder preaching the spirituality of the Force and Han Solo on the other telling him that ""hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster."" It culminates with the Death Star trench run, as Luke lets go of his conscious self and embraces spirituality, turning off the targeting computer and saving the Rebellion.   In The Last Jedi, the Battle of Crait comes down to the First Order's latest technological terror -- a siege cannon -- and the literal spirituality of Luke Skywalker. By Force projecting himself to Crait, Luke's spirituality saves the Resistance in an entirely pacifistic fashion. That not only sees Johnson bringing Luke's franchise-long arc full circle in an unexpected way, but it also sees Luke laying down his life to become an embodiment of the very ideology that the Jedi have sought across the entire saga: a true guardian of peace and justice.   Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi is a miracle. It's a big-budget franchise movie that feels like a profoundly personal passion project. Lucas' mentor, Francis Ford Coppola, often spoke of making his ""one for them"" films be ""one for you"" by imbuing them with immense personal stakes, and that is a lesson Johnson has taken to heart. The Last Jedi is a deeply personal love letter to not just Star Wars but to George Lucas as a filmmaker, which internalizes the thematic works of all that came before it in the name of delivering an immensely satisfying culmination that builds upon all of it.

"Aug 25, 2022",POSITIVE," The mammoth success of 2015’s “The Force Awakens” shouldn’t have surprised anyone. Star Wars fans had ten years of anticipation built up since the last movie and when Disney purchased the property from George Lucas they immediately began touting a new installment. Now just two years later (not counting last year’s stand-alone film) an incredible $450 million for the latest episode’s opening weekend indicates the fire hasn’t died down one bit. “The Last Jedi” is the eighth film in the series proper, the ninth Star Wars film overall. And while it has been intensely popular and profitable, the reactions have been all over the map. Some have heralded it “the best Star Wars film since Empire” while others are petitioning Disney to have it removed from canon. Regardless of where you land, everyone has to agree that “The Last Jedi” continues the franchise trend of epitomizing the ‘space opera’ concept. J.J. Abrams hands over the reins to Rian Johnson who both writes and directs episode VIII. Johnson has shown himself to be an intriguing filmmaker as evident by his movies “Brick” and the sci-fi mindbender “Looper”. But a Star Wars film is an entirely different animal, heavy with high expectations and an extremely passionate (and vocal) fanbase. Johnson’s story offers franchise fans plenty to smile at and just as much to chew on. Several scenes call back to the original trilogy and the inspiration is undeniable. “The Force Awakens” not so subtly but effectively followed the blueprint of 1977’s “A New Hope”. You could say Johnson’s film is a melding of “The Empire Strikes Back” and “The Return of the Jedi”. The structure of some scenes are so similar you can’t help but recognize it. But fear not, this is no ‘copy and paste’ rehash. Johnson has numerous fresh strokes and narrative angles that makes “The Last Jedi” feel completely of its own. Some of Johnson’s decisions have stoked the ire of certain fans, but he’s clearly trying to develop his own take on the universe. Because of this a couple of characters handed off by Abrams don’t quite get the attention. Is it because they don’t completely fit within Johnson’s vision? I’m not sure. “The Force Awakens” ends with Rey (Daisy Ridley) finding Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) on a remote island. Johnson drops his anchor and spends a lot of time on the island with Rey trying to convince Luke the Rebel Alliance needs him. She also seeks his help in understanding the Force and the powers she has discovered. But Luke has become a disillusioned hermit conflicted about his own legend and convinced the time of the Jedi has passed. Hamill’s performance may be his best yet and Ridley is such an asset. The two share several good scenes – some funny and some emotional. Elsewhere in the galaxy the young rebellion led by General Leia (Carrie Fisher) is forced to evacuate their base after Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and the menacing First Order arrive. The pursuit that follows takes a big chunk of the film and includes the return of impetuous hot-shot pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), former stormtrooper turned resistance superstar Finn (John Boyega), and droid-of-all-trades BB-8. Fisher brings out a whole new layer of humanity to Leia that’s hinted at in the previous film but truly realized in this performance (sadly her last following her recent passing). Speaking of new layers, Kylo Ren has several of them and Johnson has made him into the most intriguing character of the new series. “The Last Jedi” is the longest Star Wars film by a good 15 minutes and unfortunately you can tell. The first half has some big moments but it’s also a bit slow getting its footing. Johnson spends a tad too much time on the island only giving us baby steps of progression with Luke and Rey until finally getting in gear in the second half. The pursuit segment also has some stumbles particularly involving a side mission with Finn and a new character Rose (Kelly Marie Tran). Aside from some pretty obvious logistical issues, their mission lacks energy and only exists because of a pointless story angle involving another new face Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern). She is without question the most poorly conceived character of the new trilogy. This mission also features a pretty bad CGI-heavy chase sequence that felt completely out of sync with the rest of the movie. At the same time there are many more things Johnson gets right especially in the second half where the intensity really amps up. I especially love the stress on characters and the personal bonds many of them share. And there is also the connections between the old and the new. I’ll be intentionally vague but this can be tricky ground for a filmmaker. Johnson nails it and none of these moments feel contrived or meaningless. Some had me wanting to cheer. Others brought tears to my eyes. The film also ends with an exhilarating final sequence that leaves the story in an interesting place, ready to be picked up in Episode IX. I can certainly understand fans having a lot of questions. I do myself. But that’s a big part of the fun when it comes to a Star Wars movie – wondering and speculating. “The Last Jedi” has some early pacing issues and a few things that simply don’t make sense. But it’s still a fantastic Star Wars experience filled with excitement, emotion and nostalgia. It also features a few of those truly great moments that franchise fans will forever link with this film. I know I won’t forget them and my inner fanboy is getting a bit giddy just thinking about them. This one will keep people talking for two years until the next episode.  I’m pretty sure not all the talk will be supportive.  Obviously the crazies will be out en masse,  with resentment and ridiculous demands.  I thought almost everything with Luke, Rey and Kilo Ren worked, everything else was hit or miss. I’ll need a to see it again to help me process. I am a diehard Star Wars fan but don’t agree with a lot of the outrage. Lots of the anger seems to be centered around the handling of Luke. I actually liked it and thought it added an interesting dynamic to that character. Almost tragic in a sense. And Mark Hamill really dives into it. My only gripes deal more with holes in logic and some early pacing issues. Otherwise it’s a fun installment. Seeing it again tonight, this time with the family. Interesting take on it. I never found any of the heroes to be cowards. I think the film does a good job relating genuine conflict within them. Thanks Brittani! Seeing it again in a few hours. Really anxious to see if my handful of gripes hold up. Because, like you, I like it more just thinking about it. I’m in the camp that really liked it as I don’t understand why people complain about the length.  I found it a bit refreshing as it wanted to take some risks in exploring themes and having characters embark on different adventures to see that there is so much about the galaxy that is complicated.  Especially as there’s an air of cynicism about war.  The casino sequence is excessive but I think that’s the point because it is this decadent world full of people who don’t really care about who wins or loses just as long as they make money out of this conflict.  I think this will be the most polarizing film for now as I’m sure the third will get fans more riled up.  At least it’s not the fucking prequels which insults you with a lot of heavy-handed ideas about politics and other kinds of bullshit. I have no issue with it being long. My issue was that I could tell it was. For me Luke and Rey spend too much time on the island. Several of their interactions in the first half do little to move their story forward. And I don’t mind stories branching out. I kinda like that. But aside from some logical gaps, I felt the whole Casino world mission was the weakest part of the film and it did no favors to the Finn character. And the excess of the ‘haves’ is a nice touch, but the glaringly obvious CGI space horses were too much for me.  Nice review Keith.  I really enjoyed The Last Jedi.  I liked The Force Awakens, but that film was essentially a remake of the original.  Although Last Jedi does cobble some parts from both Empire and Return of the Jedi, its plot feels more original than TFA and its ending more deserved.  I’m eagerly looking forward to the next installment. Just got back from seeing it a second time. I still by my criticisms but I found them to be less of an issue. There are a couple of story questions I simply can’t reconcile (plotholes perhaps), but overall it is even better a second time through. I don’t hate it but I was a bit disappointed . I was not completely on board with the story of Luke at all . Having said that , Hamill acts with relish and saves it for me . I was frustrated with the Snoke story and the mystery we were led to believe from Awakens and then just tossed aside . Then Rey’s parents were just a bunch of addicts more or less . Ok , I can live with that but once again , I think there is clear continuity issues from Awakens . But it also appears that there really was no mapping out a basic 3 stage story arc and it’s flying by the seat of its pants .
Then the introduction of Rose was like why ? I didn’t find her compelling at all and the whole Casino scene seemed pointless and was cringeworthy during the stupid chase scene . I also was not pleased with the new Admiral justing showing up and I found her annoying. Her sacrifice meant nothing to me , it should have been Admiral Ackbar and would have given fans a hero we knew and felt something for , instead of just killing him off screen . Another scene I was like what , was Mary Poppins in space with Leia . Where I was sitting there were a few other fans that chuckled as well . Then that General Hux , was he like comic relief or what.
It was too long , some of the humor was dumb and poor Finn and Poe . Poe came across as an idiot and Finn was underused. Plus another irritant, could we not have had at least a memorial of some kind for Hans . I would have preferred that instead of the casino scene .
What saved the movie for me was Hamill , Driver and Ridley . All stellar performances. So my score runs like this 6 for the movie, 9 for the performances mentioned with an average of 7.5 . Thanks for the thoughts. TLJ definitely has a lot to unpack. Just a few things: I liked the Luke angle simply because it showed a deep scarred humanity to him. I like how it subverted expectations of him as legendary THE Jedi master. The Snoke story is a puzzling one. I’m not sure if Snoke simply doesn’t fit into Johnson’s vision. I do like how it propelled Kylo (who I think is the most compelling character in the new series). Also, I really like that Rey isn’t linked to Han, Luke, or Leia. I think having her parents who they are could have some serious impact. I liked Rose better the second time I saw the film. Not an exciting character though. And I absolutely agree about the Casino world chase scene. Ugh. Also agree about Laura Dern’s character just popping up and suddenly given command. It seemed completely out of the blue. I did appreciate her sacrifice, but 100% agree about Akhbar. Hasn’t he done enough to deserve command??? And How about this: Why didn’t the Admiral tell Poe about their plan? She kept it hidden from him which led to a mutiny. Think about it. If she had told Poe when he repeatedly asked about a plan Finn and Rose wouldn’t have sought a codebreaker, wouldn’t have met DJ, and wouldn’t have been betrayed. The transport ships could have made it to the planet. Also the mutiny slowed down the transport launch enabling the First Order to get the information and blow several transports out of the air. Anyway…I actually like Hux. I find him a punching bag but also a bit maniacal. I like the struggle between his militaristic vision and the Sith’s. Also as a Han guy I would have loved to see a little more of a tribute. The dice were a nice touch though. I think at the end of the day , this movie will leave many hardcore fans very unsatisfied . My problem with Hux is he felt like almost a different character than compared to Awakens  . The dice were a nice subtle touch but man , one of most iconics Star Wars and sci-fi characters and no a proper salute still gnaws at me . I really wanted to love  this movie but I really think Johnson could have introduced some new twist without deconstructing much of the mythology of Star Wars. I think this movie will end up tied with Revenge of the Sith in my Star Wars list  , the best of the prequels . I will say my excitement for  the next one has been dampened but wait and see JJ correct some of what I think were misfires by Johnson . It’s definitely been interesting watching the range of opinions. I did think about something. Wasn’t Akhbar killed in the incident that incapacitated Leia? That would explain why he wasn’t given command. It was a bummer that he was basically killed off-screen. I definitely agree that the movie was slow getting its footing. The A, B, and C plots were totally obvious and the C plot (Finn & Rose at the casino) was kindof pointless. Although I did think the film was remarkably shot and I truly appreciated the story. I enjoyed TFA more, but I think TLJ is a better film for its originality among other things. Great review! Thanks for the comments. I watched it a second time last night and found myself more impressed with what Johnson does. It does look incredible and those big moments are just fantastic. I still have the same frustrations after a second viewing but they aren’t quite as pronounced as before. Really like this installment. Oh that’s great. I need to watch it a second time before I write my review. You’re right about those big moments. The opening sequence was remarkable. I can’t wait to see what Abrams does for the last one.  Ohh I didn’t notice that. But that makes a lot of sense why that would be. I’ll look out for that in my second viewing.  Awesome review Keith, I feel you pretty much nail the head on ‘The Last Jedi’.  I’m supportive of some of the creative risks Johnson took (and that’s certainly needed in any long-running franchise) but part of me does feel that ‘The Force Awakens’ was stronger overall. There were some incredible visual treats but I’m with you on the pacing, it felt like there at times momentum was gathering only to be lost in the next moment – the Finn/Rose side mission didn’t help (glad someone else thought the CGI chase was a bit off).  Also, some of the humour felt forced and unnecessary (could this be the Disney effect? The same thing seems to bother me with the Marvel films), in the original trilogy those moments were actually funny and never felt out of place but not so much here. Thanks Chris! Definitely some pacing issues and some logic problems that I just couldn’t reconcile. Still a good installment. And I’ll give it credit, I did seem to enjoy it even more during my second viewing. I’ve heard that quite a lot, I likely won’t catch it again until the blu-ray release but it’s always encouraging to hear that a movie improves with subsequent viewings. What were your thoughts on the Luke treatment. It seems many people were upset at how he was written. Personally I liked it. It showed the humanity of Luke. And since Jedi are taught to suppress emotion, it makes sense for him to cut himself off from the force considering the deep emotional impact of what he faced. I too was fine with it Keith, we’d already had Luke’s journey as a hero in the original trilogy and I felt it was right to do something surprising and unexpected with him.  As you point out the way he was depicted in TLJ made him more human and relatable…even a Jedi can be fallible and have regrets. Much has been written concerning Lukes journey in this movie but the only thing that saves this whole thing for me was the force of Hamill’s performance. He comes across as coward, selfish and woe is me at the beginning. By cutting himself off from his sister , friends etc… more or less by running from the mess he made . Now Johnson has every right to take him there , its his story but for me it doesn’t fit right with the Luke of the past . I have zero issue with him being conflicted , guilt ridden etc.. but that whole story felt off . Hamill even felt so , although he has back tracked . But I will attempt going forward to stop thinking about it because the more I do sit around with other Star Wars fans , the more we begin to really pick it apart lol . But that is the passion of fans concerning anything I guess . That’s interesting. I never saw him as a coward or selfish. I saw as broken and disillusioned. I saw him as someone who was overwhelmed by the emotions of the situation he endured. And since the archaic Jedi system he had been taught in failed him, he cuts himself off from the force. I really liked the mental and emotional complexity he’s fighting.  I noticed one or two possible issues with the story when thinking about it later (one of which – Finn’s and Rose’s mission turning out to be pointless – I actually thought rather clever).  And I didn’t get why Admiral Holdo looked like someone out of The Hunger Games.  On the whole, though, I had very few issues with the film. For me the the entire Finn and Rose mission was completely pointless. It didn’t need to even happen. One reason it did happen (and another major issue I had) was Holdo. Her character made no sense to me whatsoever. Of all the times to suddenly feel you needed to teach Poe a lesson. Why on earth wouldn’t she tell him of their plan? I also wasn’t crazy about Leia pulling a Mary Poppins in space. Something about that didn’t click. The “Mary Poppins” bit didn’t entirely “click” with me either, although I didn’t really mind it too much.
I LOVED the Luke-Kylo Ren confrontation (Mark Hamill really threw himself into his role), and the direct the film shifts the franchise in."
"Mar 16, 2022",POSITIVE," Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi arrives with a measure of freedom, being disencumbered from the responsibility to restart the franchise that beset (and some would argue hampered) its breezy predecessor, director J.J. Abrams’ The Force Awakens. Rather than dwelling on nostalgia or trying to recreate our fond memories of the original trilogy with blatant parallels to George Lucas’ 1977 original, the new film carves out its own identity. In fact, that very notion finds a thematic strain in the narrative as several of the film’s characters place a distance between themselves and their earlier counterparts. In a key scene, the temperamental Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) destroys his helmet, which he crafted to echo that of Darth Vader, vowing to uncouple from the lingering associations between himself and those who came before him. A similar act of symbolic detachment is carried out by Rey (Daisy Ridley) after finally learning the truth about Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Indeed, while The Last Jedi is brimming with adventure and the spectacle of its swashbuckler-in-space roots, more importantly, it’s a sweeping melodrama that contains no end of deconstructionist ideas about what makes a hero, The Force, and the Jedi religion. For all of its revisionist thinking, inevitable comparisons will be made between The Last Jedi and The Empire Strikes Back, since this second entry in Disney’s new trilogy contains many of the same story elements that defined the second chapter of Lucas’ original trilogy: it expands on the mythology of the series in theatrical ways; the story breaks up the main characters for smaller, individual missions; the central hero trains on a far-away planet, under the tutelage of an old master; the young trainee sees herself in a quite literal dream; secondary characters engage in a more militaristic mission; a few shocking turns and double-crosses occur; and some familial revelations will surprise viewers. (Perhaps it goes without saying at this point, but many of the film’s most significant developments will be discussed in detail throughout this review. Consider yourself warned.) Regardless of The Last Jedi‘s structural similarities to The Empire Strikes Back, Rian Johnson—the first solitary writer-director to tackle a Star Wars film since Lucas was credited as the original’s sole writer-director—delivers a different kind of Star Wars film on purely formal and narrative terms. Having tested his hand in emotional, complex science-fiction with 2012’s superb time-travel mind-bender Looper, Johnson has gradually developed from a low-budget filmmaker (his breakthrough Brick, an inventive high-school noir from 2005, began a career that has continued to advance with every project) into a key player in Disney’s future Star Wars films (he has been commissioned to start an entirely new trilogy in this universe, independent from the tales involving Luke, Leia, Rey, and Kylo). Teaming with his longtime cinematographer Steve Yedlin, The Last Jedi looks like one of Johnson’s films, but it also looks like a Star Wars film, and perhaps that says something about his passion for the franchise. The film opens just after the events of The Force Awakens, as the Resistance, led by General Leia (the late Carrie Fisher), attempts to escape the clutches of the evil First Order. During the escape, hotheaded pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) goes against his orders by launching a small-scale attack that, when backed by the few remaining Resistance bombers, gets a lot of “rebel scum” killed. The Last Jedi alternates between the First Order’s pursuit of the Resistance and Rey training with Luke Skywalker. Rey has flown the Millennium Falcon to find Luke in seclusion on “the most unfindable place in the galaxy,” and Johnson makes excellent use of that stirring last shot of The Force Awakens, where Rey hands Luke his lightsaber, by turning the moment on its head. Luke has lost faith in The Force, and he proves a reluctant teacher. Meanwhile, the Resistance tries to evade capture in a protracted chase, as General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) has somehow found a way to track their convoy even after a hyperspace flight. Much of the second act drags and meanders, proving unnecessary to the plot. Low on fuel and locked in a high-speed chase, the Resistance convoy keeps the First Order at a relatively safe distance, but Leia is injured during the ongoing pursuit and replaced with the purple-coiffed Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern). With just a few desperate hours before they’re overtaken, Poe, unwilling to follow Holdo’s uncertain plans, concocts a ridiculous scheme to send Finn (John Boyega) and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), an impassioned rebel, to a casino planet to find a codebreaker. Once they secure the codebreaker, they can sneak onto the First Order’s ship and briefly disengage their ability to track through hyperspace. This curious detour to a galactic French Riviera halts the film’s forward momentum (it’s as though one of the passengers in John Ford’s Stagecoach took a horse from the coach and went on a separate mission). Worse, it ends up utterly pointless when their plan falls through and their stuttering codebreaker (Benicio Del Toro) double-crosses them. The Last Jedi‘s midsection may feel bogged down by a needless deviation, but the rousing finale contains several impressive scenes of action and lightsaber dueling. After learning about The Force from her disenchanted instructor—specifically, how the Jedi are hubris-ridden hypocrites to think they’re the only people entitled to wield a power that surrounds everyone and everything—Rey believes she can turn Kylo toward the light on her own. A psychic rapport has somehow formed between them across an expanse of light years, and they now have a conspicuous bond through telepathic conversations. She resolves to confront Kylo and, with his help, they destroy this film’s resident Emperor, Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis, under a rubbery CGI motion-capture performance), during a breathless sequence. But this only emboldens and does not quell the monster inside of Kylo. Realizing she’s failed, Rey joins the Resistance for the final battle on a nearby planet coated with salt, which has a red soil underneath (a striking image reminiscent of Crimson Peak). Kylo leads the First Order against the last remaining Resistance fighters, and he faces Luke in a tense duel that recalls the last living moments of Obi-Wan Kenobi in A New Hope. Johnson’s screenplay results in a mind-wandering 152-minute runtime that sags in the middle (as suggested, everything involving the casino planet and Del Toro’s character proves inconsequential to the plot). Nonetheless, the writer-director incorporates revisionist ideas about the Jedi and Star Wars that go against what fans often celebrate about this franchise. His characters observe how the past and its traditions do not matter, despite the franchise’s ingrained mythology. Snoke remarks more than once that Kylo has failed to become the next Darth Vader, and perhaps out of his failure, perhaps after killing his father, Kylo resolves to “let the past die” and become his own man. Elsewhere, Rey hopes to find a living legend in the Jedi warrior Luke Skywalker, but instead, she finds a broken monk that has lost faith in his order. Finn and Rose learn that anyone can become a hero, no matter how insignifcant—and several characters learn this same lesson. When Rey discovers her decidedly modest lineage, combined with Luke’s skepticism toward Jedi precepts, it becomes evident that bloodlines do not make heroes; a person’s willingness to do what is good does. Johnson touches on themes that resonate in our present culture war, infusing The Last Jedi with an overt ideological perspective. Although hardly intentional given that Johnson’s script was finished before the 2017 election, the film opens in an age where controversial politics and nepotism go hand-in-hand, and associations cannot help be made between the Trump family takeover of Washington and the First Order’s leadership (thus making the Nazi parallels even more frightening). Johnson questions the authority of heritage, suggesting that The Force is something not exclusive to a noble few. Throughout multiple story threads, he remains critical of the super-rich and how they acquire their means, as well as those who jealously hold onto their power. Johnson’s film also calls for animal rights in a subplot on the casino planet, where Finn and Rose liberate large racing dogs; he condemns the eating of meat in a comical sequence wherein Chewbacca thinks twice before chowing on a birdlike Porg, a resignedly cute trifle; and he censures both slavery and child-labor as well. To be sure, this is the most political and socially reflective of all Star Wars films. Johnson’s formal approach is also revisionist, but fans may balk at alternative flourishes that threaten to betray the formal toolkit commonly used by filmmakers in this series and feel dissimilar from the standard formal model of a Star Wars film (though the usual swipes and transitions remain intact). Take how, during the initial Resistance escape, Rose’s sister Paige (Veronica Ngo) must release several bombs at the right moment. Johnson drops all diegetic sound and engages in slow-motion to heighten the tension, a familiar device in many other action films, but the tactic seems out of place in a Star Wars film. Johnson also plays with sound when he drops all audio except the dialogue in psychic conversations between Kylo and Rey. Similiar formal oddities appear throughout, making The Last Jedi feel less connected to other episodes in terms of its technique: Consider when Johnson interrupts the usual forward thrust of Star Wars films with a rare flashback. Or later, cinephiles may note that The Last Jedi is the first episode to make direct reference to another, non-Star Wars film. While other episodes draw inspiration from established films, the most obvious being Akira Kurosawa’s The Hidden Fortress (1958), none has been so bold as to borrow exact lines from Terry Gilliam’s Brazil (in a nod to the dreaded form, the “27B-6”). The Last Jedi alternates between material that either inspires celebration or feels strangely out of place, if not inconsistent or overly cutesy. Fortunately, there’s more of the former category. In the failing camp: the inclusion of (admittedly aww-inspiring) Porgs to sell stuffed animals and videogames; the slow-motion used throughout the film; toad-like nuns used for comic relief; the sudden disappearance of Han Solo’s charms in a universe where people, but not inanimate objects, fade into nothingness upon death; Leia’s return from the vacuum of space by way of her never-again-referenced use of The Force; and the frustrating reality that Snoke, and his horrible facial scars, will remain a villain devoid of any backstory. Obviously, most of these observations are mere quibbles. More triumphant are Driver, Ridley, and Hamill’s impassioned performances; the final lightsaber battle with Kylo and Rey; the continued energy of Boyega; and Johnson’s investment in his film’s thematic and political integrity. Whatever issues this review may have explored or nitpicked, The Last Jedi both honors and expands upon the mythology of Star Wars, while also providing the necessary, popcorn-munching escapism. The film even boasts some laugh-out-loud moments of wit and humor—the opener’s radio prank was hilarious, even if it seemed ill-suited for a Star Wars film (the misplaced meta-humor is a trend throughout the film). But Johnson’s film supplies the requisite spectacle that casual fans expect, while devoted enthusiasts have new, complex ideas to consider for the franchise’s future. The Last Jedi gives audiences much to think about; unfortunately, some of that thinking is done during the film, instead of after it. Even so, Johnson’s desire to push forward and alter the Star Wars universe in substantial ways remains brave and bold, making the film’s uneven pacing and few missteps negligible next to the sheer scope, acting prowess, and thematic ambitiousness of the episode."
"Feb 18, 2022",POSITIVE," Over the past hour, I have sat and contemplated where I even begin with the film I just saw. Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi is without a doubt the most anticipated film of 2017 and will quite possibly be the most talked about of the year as well. Over the past two years, fans of Star Wars have been anticipating the direction of where their favorite characters were going. Thanks to writer and director Rian Johnson, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is one of the most original, unique, and best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back.  Without delving into any spoilers, The Last Jedi picks up after the events of 2015’s The Force Awakens, after a successful assault on the Starkiller base. General Leia (Carrie Fisher) and the resistance must now evacuate their current hideout before the First Order arrives at their base to eliminate them. Meanwhile, the end of Force Awakens showed Rey (Daisy Ridley) having found Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) who had been in hiding since Kylo-Ren’s turn to the dark side. As seen in the trailers, Rey hopes that Luke will not only train her but also assist in helping her understand why she is so strong with the Force and that he will give her an insight into her abilities that will assist her in her path to either the dark side or the light. The basis of the plot noted, The Last Jedi is a film that you must stop and think about after viewing it. A film that while the longest in the franchise’s history at 2 hours 32 minutes is quite possibly its fastest paced in its 40 years. From beginning to end, Rian Johnson lays out a plot that keeps fans at the edge of their seats. Usually, when glancing at my phone to look at the time, it’s because of the lack of entertainment value, however, this goes the other way around. This time, I glanced hoping there was still more time left in this magnificent film. Outside of The Empire Strikes Back, The Last Jedi may be the best overall performances by the ensemble in its film history. From the latest editions to the franchise, Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis and John Boyega, to legends of the franchise, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill, The Last Jedi’s cast’s performances consistently maneuver from good to great. As a big fan of The Force Awakens and I for one failed to join the club of those that felt it was a rehash of A New Hope. That being said, while there were some callbacks to New Hope in Force Awakens, The Last Jedi’s only call back to Empire was its darker tone. Other than that, The Last Jedi goes in directions no one expected, and I for one absolutely loved every second of it. Those who were bitching and moaning on social media about the lack of originality in The Force Awakens have already taken to social media about this film saying it’s “not a Star Wars movie” along with citing its “weirdness” and I find that quite adorable. It truly shows that no matter what, there will plenty of “fans” that will always find something to complain about. A big bright spot for me was Lucasfilm and Disney having faith in Rian Johnson to not silence his vision. Directors tend to lose their voice in this big-budget franchise entries and instead of going the formulaic route, Johnson is given the keys the kingdom and while some find his vision, “weird and different,” my suggestion is to not be so close-minded and pick up Looper where Johnson’s brilliance is on full display. The future is bright for the Star Wars universe with Rian Johnson at the helm. As with every Star Wars film, The Last Jedi is a technical beauty. From its battles in space to its finale on Crait, the entire film continues the franchise’s recent streak of beautifully looking films. Visual effects, sound mixing, and editing Oscar nominations should be in the film’s future. Speaking of an Oscar nomination, John Williams should be in line for yet another nomination as he has done it again with his score for The Last Jedi. It’s brilliant. Another notch to an already sparkling resume to the greatest film composer of all time. In reading other critics reviews of this film, most are not fans of the side story between Finn and Rose. While considered filler, I did not find it as distracting as most. The Force Awakens had a similar “filler” scene with Han and Chewey and their smuggling adventures when first meeting Rey and Finn. However, Finn and Rose’s story had a purpose to the eventual end game of the film, therefore, it did not harm the film in my eyes. Finally, we have come to the Porgs. I am happy to report that they are not the Jar Jar Binks of the new trilogy. Quite frankly, they are in just enough to stay adorable and become a fan favorite among the kids. Star Wars: The Last Jedi was everything I hoped for and more. While rating it just a few hours after leaving the theater would be quite irresponsible on my part, the film is certainly the best in the franchise since The Empire Strikes Back and its twists and turns are quite frankly some of the best in the Star Wars lore."
"Dec 29, 2021",POSITIVE," The best thing sequels have going for them are that a lot of the heavy-lifting has been done. They’re free from establishing characters and winning over the audience. The Last Jedi takes full advantage of its sequel status and delivers a follow-up to The Force Awakens that expands upon that film’s characters and stories in exciting and frankly shocking ways. Writer/director Rian Johnson deserves immense praise for taking big, bold moves with the narrative that feel subversive without being disingenuous to the story that’s come before. It’s a masterful balancing act in giving the audience what they want — a rousing adventure with compelling and fun characters — while simultaneously giving the audience what they need: a story that doesn’t adhere to predictability in order to please the widest possible audience. But even then, Johnson delivers the crowd-pleasing action, endearing humor, and epic scope fans want out of Star Wars. Freed from the more reverent and fetishistic tendencies of J.J. Abrams, Johnson’s filmmaking style feels more like a natural evolution of the original trilogy than The Force Awakens. He still nails the grandiose moments like Abrams does, but he reserves being showy for moments that count. And boy, are there moments that count in The Last Jedi. There are striking story beats that, while they do echo The Empire Strikes Back and even Return of the Jedi, manage to twist those familiar bits into twists that had me reeling backward into my seat. The Last Jedi goes places that feel like the end of a saga rather than a middle entry. That actually helps make everything feel momentous and impacting. Instead of pulling punches for later entries, Johnson’s script holds nothing back and it pays off in enormous ways. There is also a real sense of darkness and complication at the heart of The Last Jedi. This film explores the sacrifice of war in a personal way that Rogue One didn’t quite understand. Instead of drenching itself in griminess and a surface desire to muddy the moral waters like Rogue One did, The Last Jedi lets its complexities and dilemmas come naturally from the characters instead of the larger plot. This also helps make some of the jaw-dropping moments hit harder. I won’t spoil any of the big stuff but I will say that as someone who considers Luke Skywalker one of his favorite fictional characters, this movie more than makes up for his absence in The Force Awakens. Luke’s arc in The Last Jedi is fraught with regret and despair, and it’s great to see Mark Hamill return to the character with a new angle with which to play him. It leads to some of Luke’s best moments in the entire series. If I had one significant complaint, it’s that the movie is a bit overlong. There are some deviations the story has to take that feel like they could be trimmed without losing a whole lot of necessary plot points or character progression. This is especially true of the section where Finn and Rose visit Canto Bight. I dug this part for some cute bits and the plethora of alien species, but it is the only part of the movie that starts to feel a tad sluggish. It’s the best of the new wave of Star Wars films by far, encapsulating everything that’s great about Star Wars as a story: hope, friendship, rebellion, conflict, and sacrifice. Without feeling like the $200 million dollar fan films that we’ve recently gotten, Rian Johnson has given us a Star Wars film that actually is a genuine evolution of the series in style, narrative, and emotion. Never before have I been as excited to see where Star Wars will go next. Oh, and you know that brand new trilogy Rian Johnson is working on? Just give him all the Star Wars. Just do it. Disney, if you’re listening, give Rian Star Wars. Please? Thanks."
"Sep 9, 2021",POSITIVE," A line delivered to heroine Rey by cosmic curmudgeon Luke Skywalker, and a stark piece of advice to anyone who thinks Star Wars: The Last Jedi will bend to their total will. Writer-director Rian Johnson delivers, through and through, a spirited Star Wars film, as Star Wars-y as Star Wars can be, but this one’s got a rebellious streak that separates it from any other LucasFilm picture that came before it. Following the grander steps of The Empire Strikes Back, The Last Jedi throws a brick through the glass house of expectations built after the fervor of The Force Awakens. Whereas that film was a fantastic piece of fan service, The Last Jedi simultaneously feeds the birds and finds new, unexpected ground to fight on. Johnson has always relished the art of subversion, and The Last Jedi is not spared his delight in disassembly. This is how you honor what’s come before: by carefully setting the stage, and blowing it all up to smithereens, Death Star style. In the rubble, new life can grow. To discuss the plot beyond the murkiest abstract should land anyone in a force chokehold, so just know that everything picks up right where J.J. Abrams left it two years ago. From there, Johnson stops and starts with no warning of when things will slow down, or when they'll go from lull to lightspeed. It’s that playfulness in the pacing, along with Johnson’s willingness to take the story in bold directions, that makes every little twist and turn so unexpected and refreshing. Mark Hamill, who’s back after his Force Awakens cameo, digs his feet into the mud to portray a Luke we really haven’t seen before. He brings some real anger and weariness to the table, a far cry from the aw-shucksy Jedi apprentice from the original trilogy. He’s a grump with gravitas, and Hamill’s is the best performance in this Jedi revival so far — though the delightful Daisy Ridley and austere Adam Driver give him a run for his money. What's more, after a calendar year of watching and waiting for the next worst moment to pop up on our Twitter timelines, The Last Jedi also stands for something we could all use a little more of: hope. Moment in and moment out, Johnson’s film finds ways to inspire, and teach, in these times of tumult. As a sensational Star Wars vehicle and a pensive reminder of ideals for any age, The Last Jedi holds its lightsaber high — a beacon for what these films can be, and what they can impart."
"Aug 24, 2021",POSITIVE," Watching “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” was bittersweet knowing the death of Carrie Fisher means that, after this film, Princess Leia will never grace the big screen again. The character of Leia has always been the one to hold onto hope, even in the most desperate times. She does so again in “The Last Jedi.” I felt the thrill of being in a full movie theater as the previews ended and the lights went dim. A hush settled in the room before the first strains of John Williams’ famous music erupted and the familiar scroll began to roll slowly up the screen. After the success of “The Force Awakens,” “The Last Jedi” has a lot of expectations to fulfill and it does so with just the right mix of gravitas and humor. Writer-director Rian Johnson crafts a story that begins right where “The Force Awakens” left off. Even after the destruction of Starkiller Base, the First Order has fought the Rebellion to the point of extinction. What’s left of the rebels is led by the exquisite General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). Together with her people, she’s trying to figure out how to overcome the power of the First Order, led by the pasty-faced slimeball, General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), and directed by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis in another CGI role). Meanwhile, on the island in the middle of nowhere, Rey (Daisy Ridley) tries to talk Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) into coming back to help the faltering rebellion and discovers that she has a weird connection with Kylo Ren (and appropriately brooding Adam Driver). Two new characters grace the story this time around. Kelly Marie Tran plays Rose Tico, a talented rebel mechanic who teams up with Finn (John Boyega) on a mission that will, hopefully, enable the rebels to live long enough to fight another day. She starts off as an overexcited fan-girl of Finn’s but embraces her mission with determination. Laura Dern’s Vice Admiral Holdo, decked out in an amazing dress, steps into an unexpected leadership position and has to deal with hothead pilot, Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), who seeks permission for his crazy plans. Rian Johnson brings freshness and originality to “The Last Jedi.” While there are enough references to the Star Wars mythology to satisfy life-long fans, the film sets off in its own direction that will ultimately lead to the next chapter in Episode Nine. The interplay between good and evil, the dark and the light, takes on a number of different forms in “The Last Jedi.” There are internal struggles, temptations to be overcome, sacrifices to be made. In the face of the evil of the First Order, the remnant of the rebels still have hope that the light will come out on top. It may not look like it right now but as long as there are people to hold onto the light the darkness will never overcome it.

"Aug 24, 2021",NEGATIVE," The Force Awakens was a fine re-entry into the world of Star Wars, even as the film seemed to be a beat-for-beat copy of A New Hope. But while The Last Jedi is definitely reminiscent of The Empire Strikes Back (particularly in its training scenes) and Return of the Jedi (in a scene I won’t spoil), this finally feels like a filmmaker putting his stamp on the series. Rian Johnson has been one of the best American filmmakers of the last decade-plus. He’s also the last of the class that had to make a few indie and modestly budgeted features before getting called up to the big leagues. But his three features prior to this – the high school noir Brick, the caper comedy The Brothers Bloom and the sci-fi thriller Looper – were all special in their own ways, but with a focus on excellent writing that both served the story and subverted our expectations. And while The Last Jedi absolutely does that, it has one thing Johnson’s movies never had before: bloat. At two-and-a-half hours, this is the longest Star Wars movie to date. And while the emotional stakes of the story as it plays out supports that scope, its pacing makes it feel at least 30 minutes too long. The story, such as it is, is basically one long chase: the rebels are on the run from the First Order, trying to find a planet where they can hole up and send a distress signal. Meanwhile, Rey is still trying to convince Luke Skywalker to train her and also return to fight the new incarnation of the Empire. “This isn’t going to turn out the way you think,” he tells Rey at one point. And for the most part, he’s right. The Last Jedi is as much into de-mythologizing the Force as it is relishing in its fantastic fight choreography and intergalactic dogfights. One of my issues with The Force Awakens was that I never bought the scenes of emotional weight. There was never enough context to believe Kylo Ren’s struggle in particular. That problem has been taken care of here, as the battle for his soul is placed front and center, with brief but crucial backstory filled in. The same goes for Rey, whose past has been the subject of countless speculation and Reddit threads. The answers here are both simpler and more complex than all that guessing. Blockbusters comparing themselves to classic films is nothing new, but the film I was most reminded of during The Last Jedi was The Dark Knight. Both films are willing to kill off major characters (for actual emotional resonance and not just for shock value), both films let trustworthy characters obscure the truth for a larger purpose, both films are probably too long and might have been better served by putting their last 30 minutes into a third film. But both films also have endless possibilities for where the series can go from here. Let’s just hope Episode IX ends better than The Dark Knight Rises."
"Jul 28, 2021",POSITIVE," AUSTIN, Texas—It may come with resources you can’t find anywhere else, but helming a Star Wars film is no walk in the park. To start, it involves sky-high expectations, continent-spanning production schedules, and perhaps unrivaled levels of fan obsession (including possible Russian social accounts lobbying for General Hux to live, seriously). The House of Mouse now also looms over everything, inevitably demanding a certain box office bottom line. That’s a daunting task for even the most established of Hollywood creators—but it’s especially herculean for a relatively unknown filmmaker. And that evidently made Rian Johnson’s intergalactic debut with The Last Jedi the perfect opportunity for a full-length behind-the-scenes documentary, The Director and the Jedi. ""I’m the newbie—every department head has done a movie of this size before,"" Johnson says as he sets the stakes early in the film. ""[Producer] Ram [Bergman] and I are the outsiders who have infiltrated. With every decision, I’m laying down my chips in front of these great poker players and trusting just a little tingle in my stomach. It’s terrifying."" Johnson, Bergman, Mark Hamill, and documentarian Anthony Wonkie came to the South by Southwest conference to present the world premiere of this unprecedented look at the Lucasfilm methods. And during the post-screening Q&A, Johnson told the crowd he was inspired to agree to it due to his own childhood fandoms. ""There was an amazing [Return of the] Jedi thing about the creature work on Jabba’s palace, and that had a great impact on me,"" he said. ""And the doc on Magnolia, the Paul Thomas Anderson film… I love docs that really get you into the process rather than promoting the end result."" The Director and The Jedi probably won’t be technically meaty enough to similarly inspire the next generation of blockbuster filmmakers—it runs for roughly one hour and 45 minutes, but the film jumps between many topics. And though we get glimpses of life with the costuming, stunt, production design, VFX, and creature departments, this new documentary has other stories in mind. Among them: the scope of a production like this must be seen to believe—120 sets, 100-plus days of filming, but budgets that can't quite fit every single desired drone and UNESCO heritage site set location (""Take Rogue One and The Force Awakens, put ‘em together, this is double in size,"" says creature supervisor Neal Scanlan). Newcomers like Johnson and Bergman or Kelly Marie Tran (Rose) have entered into this hallowed and established universe with unorthodox ideas (a casino in Star Wars?!) for the franchise's traditionalists. And as the title may imply, the dynamic between the new creator and the old star has its own heroes' journey to progress through before opening night. The documentary might have been better served by selecting the most compelling of those subplots, editing down closer to the hour mark, and maintaining a narrower but deeper focus. Ultimately it does the opposite. Still, this new documentary does have merit beyond opening up new marketing and revenue opportunities for Lucasfilm. In particular, somehow this film about the new era of Star Wars feels like a fitting send-off for the series’ pioneers. There aren’t many franchises around where the central characters (and the actors behind them) still participate beyond mere cameos some 40 years after debut. But it’s yet another unique aspect that makes a Star Wars film a big ask of any director. Take Hamill as evidence. ""When I called, I said, ‘I’ll do it [the new trilogy], and I have two requests,"" the actor recalled during the Q&A. ""I don’t want a cameo, and I want a real trilogy role."" Even though Harrison Ford is obviously not involved, The Director and The Jedi acts as a nice postscript farewell to many of the original Star Wars icons. The film reveals that more than 100 individuals auditioned for the voice of C3PO in the new trilogy, for instance, but none felt right and thus Anthony Daniels came out of retirement. And while many of the VFX folks anticipated Yoda would be done via CGI this go-round, the emotion necessary in that character’s Last Jedi reunion with Luke Skywalker meant coaxing Frank Oz back to set. The puppet itself may have been new, but the ILM team even created this version by first acquiring the original wooden model molds and building from there. Kathleen Kennedy appears on screen a handful of times, too. And though we never see him, George Lucas’ presence is certainly felt. Early on, we see the beginning stages of script trials as Johnson invites Hamill and Daisy Ridley to read in a living room at Pinewood Studios. Later in that very sequence, someone breaks into the room with a message for the new director. Some of the best parts of The Director and The Jedi come from Johnson exploring the old Star Wars world as if he were merely a kid in a candyst… err, as if he’s a kid on the set of a freakin’ Star Wars shoot. When he meets Oz, Johnson asks to try on the Yoda puppet and lets out what we learn is his signature giggle of joy. When he sees the new creatures Neal Scanlan and team bring to life, Johnson can’t hide his enthusiasm, either. Given that he grew up with some of these films, it’s no wonder the director came prepared with as defined opinions on sea cow bellies as he does Kylo Ren’s scar makeup. ""When you’re a little kid, the Jedi, and the myth of the Clone Wars, and the mysticism of Yoda—that connects to something within you,"" Johnson told the SXSW audience. ""That makes it scary coming into this, but I can’t imagine [making a film] without that—if you don’t take the Force, the Jedi, and Luke Skywalker seriously, then what’s the next step in this?"" Perhaps Johnson’s reverence for the franchise comes across best in this documentary’s most human scenes. It’s perhaps no surprise to any longtime Star Wars fans that the most genuine on-screen emotion happens when Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill get involved. On the tension front, Hamill’s initially blunt frustration with The Last Jedi’s new direction for Luke may be the only real conflict within the entire documentary. ""My character always represented hope and optimism, and here I am pessimistic and disillusioned and sort of demoralized,"" Hamill says. ""I told him, ‘I fundamentally disagree with this concept and how you use this character, but I’ll do everything in my power to fulfill your vision.’ This character doesn’t belong to me, they just let me rent him out. So no matter how it comes out, if it’s wonderful, it’s because of him. If I’m horrible, it’s also his fault."" (The majority of the post-show Q&A stayed on the relationship between Hamill and Johnson, given that the documentary leaves audiences wanting more of that dynamic. The most recent film’s title literally comes from Johnson’s new Luke Skywalker direction, after all, and one of the best moments in this doc comes when the director reveals his title idea to Hamill for the first time.) As carefully curated as you'd expect this Disney-approved documentary to be, Carrie Fisher both shares and elicits what seems like the doc’s few truly moving moments. We see her interacting with Ridley and Laura Dern, younger actors approaching Fisher with reverence both on and off screen. And moments later when the first lady of this franchise is asked how Johnson is fitting into the director’s seat and handling the canon, she doesn’t hesitate to flash the personality fans have grown to adore. ""He’s an asshole,"" she quips, prepping the insightful compliment to come. ""Rian has a very specific vision, but he’s not like that when you first meet him. He doesn’t have a dominating effect, he has a dominating vision."" The off camera mechanics behind The Last Jedi's Leia-Luke reunion are later explored, speaking to that Johnson vision that combines reverence with new energy. It was the lone documentary moment where it felt like the entire audience silently caught themselves welling up. ""The movie wasn’t meant as a goodbye,"" Johnson notes. ""But hopefully there are a lot of scenes that will give people… scenes that will feel good to see."" For diehard fans of the Star Wars franchise, The Last Jedi, or Johnson's work in particular, The Director and The Jedi qualifies as must-see. You may not get all the process you want, but you’ll leave with a sense of Johnson’s persona behind the camera and his particular approach to the unique challenge presented to him with The Last Jedi. For everyone else, you'll probably enjoy the experience, too—just know you’ll likely glance at your phone or second screen a few times. The Last Jedi this is not. But it’s more than that film’s Blu-ray extras, too. The Director and The Jedi is set for wide release on June 27... naturally, as a behind-the-scenes featurette on the Last Jedi video release. No information on additional screenings is available at this time."
"Apr 29, 2021",POSITIVE," Fun as it was, The Force Awakens was Star Wars by the book. It replayed the plot of A New Hope, with enough tweaks and loveable new characters to come off as affectionate homage rather than big ol’ rip-off. It was a safe but highly successful reintroduction to the galaxy. The Last Jedi blasts the rule book to pieces, sending the Skywalker saga in unexpected directions. Not all its risks pay off, but its biggest wins outdo anything in the previous film. For fans, there are many, many moments that will leave you cheering or weeping, possibly both at once. After a feature-length tease, Jedi brings Luke (Mark Hamill) to the fore. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is trying to cajole him into training her in the ways of the force, but Luke is resistant, after his failure with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Hamill slides back into his defining role like he’s never been away: angry, funny and still with traces of the whiny farm-boy. He gets to shine in a way he never did when he was in Han Solo’s shadow. Elsewhere, Leia is leading the dwindling Resistance, which is rapidly being picked off by the First Order. As a goodbye to Leia, director Rian Johnson does the late Carrie Fisher proud. She’s wise, quiet leader and occasional action hero. One of her final scenes is the most emotional in the entire series. It’s not a neat end to the character, or the one deserved, but a respectful farewell. The one story strand that doesn’t land is that with new character Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), a plucky engineer. Tran is terrific, but she’s stranded in a dreary side-plot with Finn (John Boyega) on a casino planet, which has the stale whiff of the prequels. The flatness of those scenes is not enough to derail an otherwise thrilling instalment. Rian Johnson conjures astonishing space battles, fills his script with genuinely excellent jokes and has deepened the characters significantly (special mention to Adam Driver, who has helped make Kylo Ren the series MVP). With all the surprises here, we’ve honestly no idea how this trilogy will conclude, but the wait to find out is already too long."
"Feb 16, 2021",POSITIVE," That line, spouted in pained fashion by Luke Skywalker, stood out in the intriguing trailer for Star Wars: The Last Jedi. It felt like more than a suggestion from Disney aka LucasFilm aka director Rian Johnson that the second film in the newest Star Wars trilogy would not follow a familiar template, as many have accused its predecessor The Force Awakens of doing. Luke’s words would turn out to bear fruit in a film which feels both like the box office shattering ultimate expression of Hollywood blockbuster it no doubt will be, and at the same time something wilfully subversive. Johnson started with small beginnings, with a precise and almost poetic low-budget modern noir, and you can still feel the pull of a director who wants to do things his way. Doing things your way as a creative force on a series like Star Wars is no mean feat. Despite how Marvel have dominated the cinematic landscape in the last decade, Star Wars has no equal in terms of scope, scale and fan anticipation. When Disney bought the franchise from George Lucas in 2012 with the intention of relaunching the saga, it was the biggest news in filmmaking for many years. Considering it was originally just three space fantasy movies, and subsequently three maligned and ill-judged prequels from Lucas, the fact Star Wars as an entity has never left the public imagination or consciousness speaks to its power. Not everyone loves it, but those who do understand Star Wars has a special alchemy no other franchise can boast. The Last Jedi is Rian Johnson asserting himself in striking fashion, with a script and story which determine to rip up the Star Wars rule book and potentially set the franchise in a bold new direction, while still honouring what came before. The fact producer Kathleen Kennedy and those at LucasFilm loved Johnson’s take so much that he has now been gifted his own unique Star Wars trilogy to devise—not just film, trilogy—shows they too are keen for Star Wars to spread its wings and embrace the future.  The Last Jedi doesn’t entirely detach from the mythological themes and fantasy tropes Lucas’ movies, and indeed The Force Awakens, played with – but it feels like the start of a brave new world. Star Wars, at its heart, has always been a metaphysical, philosophical story about contrasting, balancing forces waging within the human soul, represented by the iconic idea of the ‘Force’.  It’s why the universe may be filled with strange alien lifeforms and reliable droids, but the spiritual conflict has always been with characters who look and sound very human, despite Star Wars taking place long, long ago in a galaxy far, far away. George Lucas originally rooted this battle in Judeo-Christian terminology, with characters such as Luke discussing villainous father Darth Vader in terms such as “there is still *good* in him”. Come the 2000’s and the prequels, Lucas was attempting to convert the metaphysics into a level of ‘magic science’, with terms such as midichlorians and the like. Come The Force Awakens, when an older Leia is discussing her wayward son Kylo Ren aka Ben Solo, her description from the pen of JJ Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan is “there is still *light* in him”. Good and evil become light and dark, the Old Testament becomes a far more philosophical Buddhist concept of duality and spiritual dichotomy. Star Wars’ approach, therefore, to the underpinning religious constructs inside its world and mythology have evolved over the last forty years, changing to edge away from a harder line delineation of philosophical ideals to a depiction of the Force more in line with Far Eastern ideas of body and soul. This feels important to The Last Jedi because Johnson truly attempts to explore just what the Force means, where Lucas felt more inclined to try and explain what it *is* in his prequels. Johnson’s message very much seems to indicate ‘the Force is whatever you want it to be’, and, crucially, it’s for whoever you want it to be. This feels at odds with Lucas’ central messages within his original trilogy and especially the prequels, whereby Anakin’s Skywalker’s Lucifer-like fall from the heavenly Jedi chorus was framed in concepts of destiny, as if his transformation into Vader had long been pre-ordained. The Force, whether good or evil or light or dark, was for a Chosen few. The biggest thing Johnson does is call bullshit on that higher order idea – Star Wars is done playing with prophecy. Johnson actualises this through Rey, our erstwhile female protagonist. She grated a touch in The Force Awakens; an earnest, tomboy stray who did little except run around like a headless chicken and emote quite expressively. Daisy Ridley isn’t exactly an award-winning player in the making but Johnson’s script gives her more heft by grounding her on Ahch-To island, and developing the two key relationships central to her in the film – her dynamic with Kylo and her dynamic with Luke. What Johnson does, and one wonders if this was a change in direction from Abrams’ vision, is take away the very idea Rey is ‘special’ and has a destiny, by pulling the ultimate flanker: her parents, set up as mysterious abandoners in the previous film, were nobody, when we all expected them to be somebody. Here’s the rub, and the central key to The Last Jedi – you don’t have to be anyone in order to be someone. It doesn’t matter if Rey’s parents weren’t Jedi or Sith or gifted of some powerful history or destiny. Kylo throws this back in her face when he lands the revelation on her about her family (which she already deep down knew), suggesting “you’re not part of this story”. Johnson almost reaches out here from behind the lens and shouts – “IT DOESN’T MATTER!”. Lucas’ original tale was all about a special, gifted, destined family with a Royal, entitled lineage who provided balance to the Force, both light and dark, but Rey breaks that cycle. She is just a girl from a nowhere planet and nowhere parents who happens to be one with the Force. Star Wars can’t be the same after this evolution. Having the Force be accessible and open, free of destiny or Royalty or even the Jedi Order, opens up a mountain of possibilities. This is what Luke comes to understand through a character arc which carefully avoids him becoming Obi-Wan Kenobi, which he so obviously could have been. R2-D2 showing him the original “help me Obi-Wan…” hologram of Leia from A New Hope as he sits inside the Millennium Falcon underscores this very point – Luke may be old, may rock a beard, may have gone into hiding in a cave after watching the Jedi almost destroyed around him, but he isn’t guarding or protecting anyone, waiting for the new saviour to emerge. Luke begins this film fundamentally convinced there is no hope. Luke’s nihilism, born out of Ben Solo’s fall to the Dark Side and the destruction of Luke’s attempt to re-create the Jedi Order, is taken further by Johnson than you suspect Abrams, and definitely Lucas, ever would have dreamed. Johnson’s open, egalitarian world where the Force could be in anyone is a world where characters are encouraged to reject history and reject myth. Many fans had heard Luke was seeking a Jedi Temple and almost everyone expected The Last Jedi to see Luke uncover Jedi secrets or arcane knowledge that would help save the day – almost nobody would have expected Luke, with the help of Yoda no less, to burn that knowledge and those secrets to the ground and extinguish the Jedi of the past. Doing this was perhaps the film’s bravest choice. Bear in mind just how much the Jedi religion and idea has become an iconic piece of pop culture and, to an extent, has grown beyond Star Wars itself. People don’t dress up as random Sith Lords, but they do dress up as Jedi Knights. In the UK, on a religious census, Jedi was written by so many people as their denomination that the government had to officially recognise it, passing the required 100,000 signatures. We’re talking about a fictional code which if not practiced by film fans, and children, the world over, is certainly revered and honoured by millions. The word Jedi would be known to almost everyone in Western society, irrespective of whether they know Star Wars well or not. To fundamentally change the paradigm of how the Jedi work is a striking move. Luke spells this out when lecturing Rey in why the Jedi need to die, reminding her it was their hubris and arrogance which allowed Darth Sidious to turn the Republic into an Empire, and subsequently see the extermination of much of the Jedi Order. While this is Luke to a sizeable degree abrogating Sidious and Vader of responsibility in the choices they made (and it all does come down to choice), his point is given context and clarity by Yoda: the Jedi doesn’t have to exist in the form it did for millennia in order to survive. Much like the Star Wars franchise itself, the Jedi can themselves evolve in purpose and form, and this plays greatly into Johnson’s other major level of commentary: sociological class in the Star Wars universe. A tonally jarring sequence it may be, and perhaps an indication of one of Johnson’s weaknesses as a filmmaker (his own Looper has the same problem), but Finn and Rose’s sojourn to the Canto Bight casino and races planet reveals the major schism and dichotomy which has always existed in the Star Wars universe but Johnson writs large – the lower and upper classes which make up the galactic framework. Rose seems like a needless additional character but her purpose is abject; her essential skills are the final expression of a crucial part of the Resistance and fight against tyranny, despite her coming from nothing (much like Rey). She was one of the servants and slaves who feed the rich gamblers and dilettantes which fill Canto Bight, people who became rich off the First Order’s rise to power. This too has to be a pointed level of allegory in Johnson’s writing, which is interesting as Star Wars doesn’t often tend to stray too heavily into an allegorical framework of storytelling, much as Lucas apparently read the original 1977 movie as an indictment against Vietnam, with the United States as the evil Empire. The commentary here is clear – the 1% of super wealthy are serving a dark, fascist, tyrannical force who want to be the ultimate boot in the face of the little people. By giving the Force back to this underclass, the Rebellion of the original trilogy and the Resistance of the sequel trilogy are framed in a new context: the Revolution. Johnson’s final shot, of a young, impoverished child looking up at the stars, wearing a Resistance sigil and holding his broom like a lightsaber after hearing stories about Luke and the Jedi sells it: the Force is with everyone, and woe betide a fascist dictatorship who underestimate them. Naturally you can apply the iconography and visual style of the First Order with the Nazi Party (Abrams made this very clear in The Force Awakens) but is Johnson making quite pointed parallels to the modern Republican government and the increasingly fascist direction of Donald Trump’s Presidency? Possibly. Not pointedly, but the inference is certainly there. The fact those young children are telling stories, too, is crucial, because it reframes the myth and legend Johnson’s script is keen to snuff out, or at least redefine without the historical names and touchstones characters in the Star Wars universe, and fans outside of it, are used to. Johnson clearly sees legends in a different way to Abrams. The latter feels they’re important and venerates them – you only have to look at Rey’s excitement when she first meets Han Solo in The Force Awakens, and the hushed tones of myth when Luke is referred to. This is exactly how we, the audience, consider these characters and The Force Awakens indulged our euphoria at being in their presence once more. The first thing Luke does when we meet him in The Last Jedi is disdainfully toss away the lightsaber which itself became legend – the lightsaber that fought Vader, which cut off Luke’s hand in The Empire Strikes Back. To all of us, its a symbol. It was almost the McGuffin of The Force Awakens. Johnson tosses it away like its nothing, like its a falsehood. Legends are earned, not simply made and set in stone. Kylo Ren certainly comes to understand this, and quite early on. It’s telling how Johnson has him destroy the very mask he created to try and emulate his grandfather Vader. That was a visual piece of original series iconography in The Force Awakens, Abrams’ honouring the legend of Vader, but when Supreme Leader Snoke mocks him for wearing it, Kylo destroys it and never wears a mask again. His central, inner conflict across The Last Jedi is no longer about trying to be Vader, it’s deciding where his destiny lies. Kylo believes himself part of the Skywalker path he mocks Rey for not being part of, but he’s choosing to repeat the cycle of the original trilogy. He chooses not to blow up Leia, or kill Snoke instead of Rey. That choice wasn’t the same for Vader when a very similar situation played out in Return of the Jedi. The Emperor actively wanted Luke to kill his father to ‘complete his training’, in no small part because part of him undoubtedly knew Vader could be more powerful than even him. Snoke doesn’t consider Kylo in the same terms. He thinks him weak and feeble for much of this, and doesn’t even countenance the possibility he could be bested. Johnson sets up an Episode IX which explores the concept Return of the Jedi never could – what if Vader had chosen to kill his master and become Emperor, instead of dying regretting his dark path? Kylo actively chooses this path, even if he doesn’t choose the direction. Indeed Kylo is as keen to redefine everything as Luke is. Remember how he asks Rey to join him, but not in the same way Vader asks Luke to join him in Empire. Vader wanted to continue the Empire, wanted to reaffirm the status quo as a family, hereditary, honoured, Royal destiny, but Kylo wants to let it all burn – not just the Jedi but the Order. He wants Rey to join him and start again, redefine what the Dark Side could mean. Johnson doesn’t even use the words ‘Dark Side’ across his script, another rejection of the previous terminology and tropes which define the Star Wars universe. Sides aren’t as clearly defined in The Last Jedi. There is room for manoeuvre. Kylo almost becomes the new Supreme Leader by sheer happenstance, once he puts General Hux in his place. Story therefore is key to The Last Jedi, and how it inverts what we expect from Star Wars. Indeed there’s a clear level of self-mockery going on with quite how Star Wars tells its narrative; how Johnson plays Hux as a fascist buffoon for comedy is telling, from Poe Dameron’s early joke about not being able to connect, and a wonderful moment when Hux shouts an order again that Kylo has just given – there’s a wonderful glance by Kylo as if to say ‘I just said that, what are you doing?’. This subverts the very earnest way Admirals and Commanders, often with cut glass British accents, would repeat and deliver orders in the original trilogy, often thanks to Lucas’ quite ripe dialogue. Johnson seems to understand the silliness inherent in Star Wars while honouring and revelling in everything about it. The Last Jedi could well end up being the most polarising Star Wars film ever made. It’s a touch too long, has tonal problems, feels like it has two distinct endings rather than just one, and it lacks the sheer joie de vivre of The Force Awakens, but intentionally so. It’s the middle part of a story where the heroes take a severe beating at the hands of a seemingly unstoppable, un-defeatable force, to an even greater degree than they do in The Empire Strikes Back; this is a Resistance taken to the absolute brink of destruction and saved only by the power of the Force let loose from the restraints of the Jedi. There are plenty of moments of levity, nods and winks to previous films, and lots of loveable droids and cuddly alien creatures (hello Porgs!), but The Last Jedi by default has to be a story where victory and resolution is far from the characters’ grasp. Where it will divide opinion is just how it approaches the Star Wars universe, attempting to redefine and reconstitute some of the key, central concepts which have made the franchise and the mythology ingrained within such a revered success for forty years. Rian Johnson’s film will potentially reward repeat viewing in a way certainly The Force Awakens doesn’t, and The Last Jedi leaves a returning JJ Abrams with some oddly big shoes to fill, because his successor has changed the very manner in which the Star Wars universe considers itself. "
"Jan 27, 2021",POSITIVE," CLEVELAND, Ohio -- In the run-up to this week's mammoth release of ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"" director Rian Johnson and company have been selling fans an idea that the latest film in the saga is unexpected, unpredictable and unlike any other episode that came before it. ""The Last Jedi"" is at once a thrilling space adventure and an emotional roller coaster of a film with just the right amount of nostalgia thrown in. It's simultaneously dark and funny with more twists and turns than a ride aboard the Millennium Falcon. Clocking in at two and a half hours, ""The Last Jedi"" is a dense film, full of characters scattered across the galaxy and put through the wringer. There's a lot to get to. The action begins with the evil First Order in pursuit of the freedom-fighting, depleted Resistence, but the film really gets off the ground when the story shifts to the island planet Ahch-To and the moment where ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" left off. Fans have been waiting for two years to see what Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) does when Rey (Daisy Ridley), a girl strong with the Force but a mystery to him, presents him with his old lightsaber. This clearly isn't the same Luke we last saw in 1983's ""Return of the Jedi."" The confident, wise, legendary hero of the Rebellion is gone, lost and replaced by a broken shell of the man he once was, a failure in his own eyes for not stopping his nephew, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), from turning to the Dark Side. Get over the fact that, yep, that's Mark Hamill(!) up on the screen as Luke Skywalker once again, and you'll find a skilled actor channeling his inner Shakespeare in a performance that is tortured and inspired. He's a relunctant Yoda to Rey's aspiring Jedi, an experiment that doesn't go all that well. Leave it to an old friend (no spoilers here) to set him straight. If Skywalker is at the emotional center of the film, Rey and Kylo Ren serve to deliver its underlying message of letting go of the past in order to find yourself. The two have developed a connection since we saw them last. She calls him ""Ben"" and helps him deal with the death of his father, Han Solo. He knows stuff about her parents. Is their bond strong enough for one of them to turn? That is answered, rather compellingly, in a jaw-dropping sequence highlighted by one of the coolest lightsaber fights you've ever seen. Indeed, this is not going to go the way you think. In their scenes together, Ridley and Driver fully inhabit their characters, who refreshingly aren't the classic archetypes of good and evil we're used to seeing. Ridley's Rey is strong, compassionate, determined, optimistic and, yet, temptable. Driver's Kylo Ren is as complex as he is conflicted, that ever elusive villain with nuance you just might find yourself rooting for. His performance is that good. That's not to say it all works. While Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) are given plenty to do, their stories don't really go anywhere. Lingering questions about the evil Snoke (Andy Serikis) are left unanswered. In her final appeance as Leia, Carrie Fisher is largely kept on the sidelines and some fans might even find one of her early scenes to be, frankly, ridiculous. If Domhnall Gleeson's performance as General Hux was any hammier, you could serve it at Thanksgving. The film's new additions, namely Kelly Marie Tran, Laura Dern and Benicio del Toro, carve out their places in the galaxy far, far away just fine. The standout is Tran, whose plucky mechanic Rose steals every scene she's in. Among the non-humans, you might cringe at the first sight of a Porg, that is, until Chewbacca tries to eat one and then you'll fall in love with the furry little creatures. BB-8 is so cute and resourceful here, the round mound of the rebellion might as well be an Ewok. Threepio is, well, Threepio. R2-D2 gets a moment to shine for old time's sake. By contrast, the film's final showdown is undecidedly unrestrained, one that forces you, in the famous words of Darth Vader, to search your feelings. Once again, the ragtag group of Rebels finds itself facing incredible odds against the heavily armed forces of evil. Their battle is as exhilarating and epic as anything we've seen in a ""Star Wars"" movie. But, as it tends to happen in these films, ""The Last Jedi"" comes down to a lightsaber duel. But, trust, you haven't seen one like this before as Johnson delivers the goods with an ending that is surprising, satisfying and even hopeful-- one that is sure to make even the most stoic fanboy shed a tear or two or twenty.

"Dec 5, 2020",NEUTRAL," upreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and his First Order minions, commanded by General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), continue to take military control over more and more planets. Their only real opposition is the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), who faces dwindling numbers of soldiers and ships, as well as nonstop confrontations against an enemy of vastly superior strength. As Hux’s fleet steadily closes in on its prey, Resistance heroes Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), along with newcomer Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), devise a precarious plot to evade their First Order pursuers. Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley), a strong-willed orphan powerful in the Force, locates long-missing Jedi Master Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), hoping to persuade him to both train her and aid in the Resistance’s plight. But after his previous failure with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), a former student who turned to the Dark Side, the reclusive tutor becomes insistent on not repeating his mistakes with Rey. When the rebellious young girl discovers an unnerving connection to the Dark Jedi, she determines to face Ren once again, even if it means surrendering to Snoke himself. “The Last Jedi” begins like “The Empire Strikes Back,” before quickly turning into “Return of the Jedi.” It’s surely purposeful for this latest chapter to pay homage to its predecessors, but there’s a limit to the nods, which shouldn’t be surpassed, for fear that it succumbs to the main criticism of “The Force Awakens”: that it’s essentially a remake. But writer/director Rian Johnson doesn’t seem too concerned. In order to fuel the nostalgia factor to an extreme degree, the film opts to recreate many familiar storylines and scenarios from the original trilogy, forgetting that the world is so expansive that it wouldn’t take much to concoct something entirely new. Instead, a disgruntled Luke exists in seclusion on his own equivalent to Dagobah, and must train a fresh apprentice as if to become a less mischievous version of Yoda; a rebel base is evacuated as enemy ships prepare to wipe it out (a sequence that boasts substantial comedy, which feels unnatural); elephant-shaped tanks slowly saunter across a bleached battlefield; and yet another iteration of Mos Eisley’s tavern of decadence furnishes strange creatures and odder aliens. The first two-thirds of “The Last Jedi” focuses heavily on old routines. Trivial side missions are derived spontaneously to give certain sets of characters extra adventures – and to draw out an already long running time. In fact, one of the major components of the film is a slow-speed chase, which is so lengthy that it allows numerous other mini-stories to play out to their conclusions (including a hunt for a codebreaker, preparations for abandoning the fleet, and Rey’s Jedi training) – all before a dreadnaught warship finally catches up to the cruiser it was pursuing. Much of this picture involves space battles, which, while exciting in the moment, has very little lasting power. They also contribute to an overwhelming number of close-calls – ones designed to drag battles out to the last second, where tensions can build with ample manipulation. When plot lines choose to follow this course, they generate a sense of blind luck; most of the rebels are unable to accomplish their tasks, perhaps due to poor planning or trusting in the wrong allies, but they rarely perish in logical ways. Martyrdom tends to save them all, even when luck falters. “There’s still conflict in him!” Numerous lines are delivered with strained sincerity, especially as a subplot to find the remaining strands of good left in Ben Solo – and to turn him to the Light Side – begins to resemble “Return of the Jedi” a bit too much. Adding to that comparison is Snoke, an elderly, robed, wrinkled, lightning-spewing, inexplicably evil entity. Who exactly is he supposed to be? Zero answers were given in “The Force Awakens,” and this follow-up remains comparably tightlipped – pointlessly. His involvement and storyline are indicative of too many creative visions continually altering or revising key concepts. But despite the vagaries and vagueness and repetition, the visuals are stunning: new spaceship designs are appropriately menacing; special royal guards in shiny red armor wield lightsaber-like weaponry; and a mining facility sits on crimson dirt, blanketed by glowing white salt. Countless other sequences, brimming with explosions and action and computer-animated monstrosities, will remind viewers that the “Star Wars” franchise has few limitations when it comes to visual effects. At the end of it all, “The Last Jedi” is still a middle chapter (which means that it doesn’t tell a complete story and leaves many questions unanswered), but a few major surprises and some jaw-dropping showdowns are thoroughly entertaining – especially for audiences who aren’t too caught up in the series’ insistence on revisiting so many recognizable themes and ideas.

"Sep 24, 2020",POSITIVE," It wasn't anything but Star Wars. There wasn't any such thing as A New Hope. In my 12-year-old mind, I wasn't entertaining any notion that this amazing universe unfolding before my eyes would have sequels or become a years-long saga.  I was a 12-year-old boy, an outcast in virtually every area of my life. I was a young boy with a disability and Star Wars, in some weird way, gave me a place where I felt like I belonged.  I loved everything about Star Wars. I loved the heart and soul of these relationships between Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, R2-D2, C3PO, Darth Vader and all the others. I loved the adventure. I loved the humor. Heck, I was only 12-years-old but I even loved the incredibly chaste romance.  The same was true, maybe even more true, for The Empire Strikes Back, which has long been my favorite amongst the Star Wars films though I'm certainly far from alone in that opinion. While what we now call A New Hope started it all, The Empire Strikes Back is the film that truly made me fall in love with this universe and these characters and their stories. After The Empire Strikes Back, these Star Wars films became more than just a couple hours of escape to me - they became, in ways I'm not even sure I can explain, a way of life.  I thought about all of these things as I sat back in my seat and became enveloped in the worlds manifested in Rian Johnson's latest of the Star Wars entries, The Last Jedi.  While The Force Awakens brought the series back from the brink of prequel devastation, The Last Jedi brings back the heart and soul of Star Wars in ways I'd feared impossible and in ways that took me back to those days when I was an absolutely enthralled 12-year-old staring up at the movie screen imagining myself immersed in these remarkable worlds.  This is not to say that Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi is a flawless film. It's not a flawless film, but if not flawless it's a near cinematic masterpiece that should have, I'd dare say will have, audiences falling in love all over again with Star Wars and these new adventures and adventurers and the ways in which Rian Johnson has masterfully incorporated faithfulness to the film's legacy with a unique vision that is woven into the fabric of the Star Wars universe to near perfection.  The challenge, and I'm trying desperately here, is to share my immense joy with the film without providing spoilers along the way because, indeed, there isn't a scene that unfolds here that I wish to give away. I want you to experience it for yourself.  The Last Jedi offers something for everyone in its increasingly complex and shaded portrayals of Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega), its reverence for Luke (Mark Hamill), its respectful yet somewhat slight embrace of the now deceased Carrie Fisher as Leia, or simply the ways in which Johnson has found to create action sequences that are familiar yet fresh. Tasked with finding life within this middle film within a trilogy, Johnson has done more than bridge two book-ends. He has created an adventure that ripples throughout the universe while adding in a few of his own flourishing touches.  There are certain story threads of The Last Jedi, especially those connected to how The Force Awakens unfolded and ended that are simply brilliant in the ways in which they add layers to the existing universe. It is much to his credit that Johnson has found ways to both honor that connectivity while adding layers to it and characters that are no longer simply black-and white but several shades of gray.  Despite having achieved near superstardom in Star Wars, there's a reason that Mark Hamill's film career never came close to achieving the heights of Fisher or Ford. The truth is he was always the weaker actor, a charming kid who never stopped playing a charming kid until he was finally too old to play a charming kid. It's damn near miraculous what Johnson has pulled out of Hamill here, a melancholy and soulful performance that emotionally resonates and feels like it belongs here. He has attained the status of legend here, yet it's a status he doesn't want from a life he's long since left behind. How this all plays out between he and Rey is beautiful to behold on this tiny island where he has secluded himself amidst the lively, inspired creatures we've come to know and love from the Star Wars universe.  Of course, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is back. He's scarred now, a physical memory left over from his epic The Force Awakens battle with Rey and he's still the same ragingly immature young man who is both a conflicted villain and a dastardly one who feels and acts even more evil here. Paired up with General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), it feels inevitable that his evil will grow and that somehow he and Rey will deal with one another again and again.  There are others, of course. Poe (Oscar Isaac) is relentless in his efforts to go face-to-face with his enemies, while newcomer Laura Dern shines as Vice-Admiral Amilyn Holdo. Finn finds himself teamed up with Rose, a rebel engineer played expertly by Kelly Marie Tran as the two embark on a code-breaking mission that looks familiar yet has been designed impeccably.  Benicio Del Toro is here, as well, in a relatively brief appearance and the film features many of the others familiar within the Star Wars universe and more than a few pleasant surprises along the way.  At 152 minutes, The Last Jedi goes on for a bit too long and tries to tell us too many stories but these truly are minor quibbles for a film that is relentlessly captivating, magnificently produced and utterly immersive from beginning to end. Johnson has not only mastered Abrams' return to technical precision, but he's also embraced the heart, the humor, the depth, and the hope that we all felt when all of this began in 1977.  Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi may not be a flawless film, but it's amazingly close to everything that I wanted it to be. With strong, layered and more authentic performances from its ensemble cast and a universe that will make you feel like it's a place where you belong, The Last Jedi becomes one of the most satisfying Star Wars films to date, perhaps second only to The Empire Strikes Back, and a film that will make you want to watch it again and again and again. "
"Aug 26, 2020",POSITIVE," It may not be the greatest Star Wars film ever.  That mantle still resides with The Empire Strikes Back and naturally it will take time (preferably a second watch) to see how this film will rank overall.  However, Star Wars: The Last Jedi might be the most significant in the franchise’s history. The last major release of the year and The Last Jedi is a milestone release for a few reasons.  The most obvious of course is that it follows on from the highly enjoyable The Force Awakens.  Director Rian Johnson receives that challenging baton to pick up the where the story left off.  But in the larger context, 2017 has brought back the art in films where directors have used the medium to deliver unconventional films that have gone against audience expectations and taken us out of our comfort zone.  We’ve seen it in Logan, Dunkirk, Blade Runner 2049, War for the Planet of the Apes, Baby Driver, Wonder Woman, Get Out and Detroit. The Last Jedi naturally belongs on that list.  To paraphrase Obi Wan in A New Hope – this was not the Star Wars film you was looking for. The Last Jedi is far from perfect.  No film is.  Does the runtime feel a little excessive?  Yes.  The ending felt a little tact on when it already had a natural resolve and could have been saved for the next film.  Could the pacing been a bit better?  Yes.  Are there a few OTT moments which are cheesy?  Yes.  Is it clunky at times?  Yes.  Could some elements of the story been handled better to give it some tonal consistency?  Absolutely. For all the love I have for The Force Awakens, it’s hard not to see the obvious connections to A New Hope.  That is not a criticism but a common observation.  As mentioned in my review, The Force Awakens uses A New Hope as a guidance to shape the new trilogy.  It is specifically designed and constructed to introduce the next generation of strong characters in Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Kylo (Adam Driver) and Poe (Oscar Isaac).  But The Force Awakens is steeped in heavy nostalgia, reminding the audience why they fell in love with the franchise as if we magically became children again.  Seeing familiar things like the Millennium Falcon, the droids and all the familiar faces from that universe are the equivalent of buying and listening to a greatest hits compilation.  Again, not a criticism but it helps build a context for The Last Jedi because it is the stonewall opposite of that. The dangerous thing about nostalgia is that it can eventually become predictable and safe because of the lack of engaging challenges or fresh new stories for its audience.  It’s the surreal sense of deja vu and like comfort food it relies on the same clichés and tropes to tell a story that remains within that unadventurous status quo.  Rogue One largely suffered in that respect.  It sadly doesn’t hold up after repeated viewings because of the high level of distracting fan service and not enough character development to flesh out a real and genuine purpose for the rebels to fight against the Empire.  The film was clunky, saved only by the incredible battle on Scarif.  We’ve already seen in other franchises such as Alien, Pirates of the Caribbean and Terminator on how tired that repetitive formula can be. For franchises to have a chance at survival, they eventually need to evolve.  Otherwise, they stagnate or in the worse case scenario, die as a consequence. However rough around the edges this film was (and possibly could have done with another written draft), if The Force Awakens showcased that original, nostalgic innocence where it was allowed to be fun and energetic, then The Last Jedi is arguably the most layered, adult and grown up Star Wars film ever made. That is one of the most surprising elements.  Star Wars is meant to be a rapturous feeling of childhood excitement, fist-pumping hype and expectation but The Last Jedi delivers something unexpected.  This is a film that took a risk with the Star Wars mythology by challenging those sacred and conceived notions.  As controversial and upsetting this may sound for die-hard fans, but The Last Jedi doesn’t deliver on fan pleasing moments, revelations or cliffhangers (both in the cinematic fashion or literal fashion with Luke in The Force Awakens) just to satisfy an audience.  This is a film that was bold enough to make a challenging statement to propel the franchise into uncharted territory where you have no idea what is going to happen next. Given the amount of fan theories and in-depth discussions that developed in between the new films, it’s a nice feeling to be suddenly kept on your toes and freed from the compartmentalized beliefs.  Because ultimately that was the danger with Episode 8, long before the famous “A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away,” faded on-screen.  Maintain the status quo and accusations of a lack of originality would have been fierce.  We would have been back to square one in questioning the repetitive direction.  But from a cinematic experience, who would want to go to a cinema and already know the outcome of the film? At the heart of it, The Last Jedi is more of a character driven movie which again is another welcomed surprise.  Similar to what Twin Peaks: The Return did, the more The Last Jedi is analysed, the more it serves as a brilliant running commentary about the legacy of franchises and how we interact with them.  We’re all guilty of it.  There’s always an element of hero-worship where characters become a source of inspiration and motivation.  We put them on a higher plane where we can look up and believe.  It also creates a celebrity head canon and culture defined by our own fantastical expectations.  Yet similar to Denis Villeneuve‘s Blade Runner 2049, The Last Jedi cleverly dissects the idea of the hero complex by subverting the traditional story construct we’re use to.  It embraces a nuance that is explored not as simplistically as good versus evil, but something far more complex, blurred and in-between.  What writer and director Rian Johnson achieves are characters which are more human, grounded and real. It’s not done in a disrespectful way.  The classic and faithful homages are present and acknowledged.  There are emotional scenes which recognise the symbolic connection of the journey started forty years ago.  But The Last Jedi also rips up the rule book on what was done before to journey into the beyond.  That aspect of The Last Jedi was the most liberating. How often do you see a Star Wars film where the rebels are really up against it and on its last knees?  Suddenly you slowly find yourself watching a bleak situation and the opening battle is one of the best moments in the film.  It’s not to say that this aspect wasn’t explored before in previous films but The Last Jedi gave us something more visually in-depth instead of the 2D characterisations that Rogue One or the prequel trilogy suffered from at times.  It’s the exploration of the human struggle, the sacrifices and the highly charged conflicts that rose out of those battles.  As the tide kept on turning, the weaponry for the fight back becomes limited as if the First Order are Apple to the Rebels’ Windows 95.  Our heroes are under severe pressure and there’s a consequence to these actions.  That’s what kept the film interesting and emotionally dramatic.  Suddenly you felt an endearing care for characters because of their own personal story arc.  Like a cross-generation divide between the old and the new, everybody eventually learns and develops from their actions to become better leaders. That speaks true of Rey and Kylo Ren.  Their parallel story involves abandonment and trying to find a belonging in this vast universe.  In a seminal way, they’re both looking for acceptance from their surrogate “fathers” which naturally plays along with the standardise thinking of the light and the dark side.  But in the particular case of Kylo, arguably one of the best, well-rounded villains created for the new trilogy, his desperate emulation to be Darth Vader 2.0 is ridiculed as a childish exercise by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis).  The emotional conflict that resides between the two characters is their ultimate desire to live up to their influential legends and The Last Jedi becomes the realisation that they are stronger than what they think they expect of themselves.  There’s a beautiful line which sums up that evolving trajectory – “We are what they grow beyond.” But it’s also how the film deals with the old guard.  We see General Leia (the late, great Carrie Fisher), vulnerable and scared of the consequences as she counts up the losses.  Luke Skywalker (a brilliant performance by Mark Hamill) is not the clean-cut hero you thought he was.  He’s tired, old, frustrated and a recluse.  Whilst that may split the opinion of the fan base, the positive argument that is established makes him more human.  Time has become a factor and the galaxy has changed, allowing these characters to grow.  We get to see them in a new light, faults and all.  It may go against reason but it also allows characters to escape that bubble and redefine who they are on a path to a peaceful redemption.  It’s different but it is a positive different. But the best of that improved characterisation is how it moves away from a singular ‘you are our only hope’ perspective to a collective ideology.  Again nothing new in the Star Wars world but it’s always pined its hopes on characters bringing balance to the force – the chosen one.  Yet the turmoil has previously ended the same way with the balance ushering in a fascist, totalitarian and autocratic power.  Nobody does the battle alone like a God like saviour and it’s how Johnson found that aspect of the story to tell a distinction between the past and its upcoming future. Rian Johnson excels in showcasing a visual poetry.  J.J. Abrams started this trend in The Force Awakens, freeing the camera from the static nature from the original to a barrel-rolling effect, making us feel we’re right in the thick of the battles.  But for The Last Jedi, the visual storyline is all about the emotional impact, directly connected with the choices made by characters.  Johnson intentionally slows down the action and cuts the sound as if there was a vacuum in space and it removed all the air.  On hindsight it may have contributed to the slow pacing of the film but to see this subtle effect is new for the franchise, reinforcing that mood of action equals consequence.  On the planet Crait, the “blood in the sand” effect acts as a psychological reaffirmation of war and its sacrificial nature, without showing actual blood on-screen.  Every soldier is like a dead person walking towards an impending doom.  The visuals also extends to the production sets which are beautiful, in particular Snoke’s red room and his guards. Through the visuals, director Rian Johnson finds the time to explore the political aspect of The Last Jedi.  Star Wars has always been political with arguably the prequel trilogy closely mirroring today’s world of right-wing nationalism rising up through a democratic society.  But in The Last Jedi, the First Order is made fun of and Domhnall Gleeson as General Hux comes through as the best of how seriously he believes in The First Order and how others mock him.  Again it contributes to the pacing of the film but introducing Canto Bight also highlights the dividing difference between the wealthy rich and the slave poor and the blurred lines that has a direct relevance with the world today. The Star Wars universe is vast with so many potential stories to tell.  The Last Jedi met my expectations because it was an attempt for the franchise to do something different that most blockbuster films struggle with.  It had the audacity in its attempt to break the mould and break out of a repeating cycle that had become far too familiar and predictable.  This is not The Empire Strikes Back in the franchise but a progressive move forward to shape its own new legend and that recognition and understanding will take time.  It’s hard to see what path Star Wars will take knowing that this is the second film in the saga.  But it will be interesting to see how J.J. Abrams will complete, shape and refine those changes for the untitled Episode 9. It will be during this time when people will look back on The Last Jedi not with a petition loving hatred but with an appreciation for the risk taken in the first place.  That should be congratulated regardless. Excellent review! You have captured it perfectly. I thought this was an exciting and risky film, and I commend Disney for being gutsy enough to break away from the expected narrative and risk angering fans. I too believe that when some currently angry fans look back (especially after IX) they’ll like this film more than they do now. It has a few flaws (although these bothered me less on second viewing) but it is a powerful film that really moves the characters forward. Portraying Luke as a broken man opened the door for Mark Hamill to give us a more nuanced performance, and I loved that this movie did not go the way I thought it would. My greatest fear is that Disney will over-respond to the backlash and create a “safer” film for Episode IX. I really don’t want that. I want them to keep pushing the Star Wars universe in new directions. Financially was never going to be a problem with Disney and the Star Wars franchise but the fan backlash can still have an impact on Episode 9 and the other potential risks they may want to do with the franchise.  I don’t think it will happen but anything is possible."
"Jul 23, 2020",NEUTRAL,"In terms of directing, The Last Jedi shines. In terms of storytelling, it meshes together a lot of elements that have so much potential, but that potential is left untapped."
"Jul 17, 2020",POSITIVE,The Last Jedi attempts to use the past merely as a stepping-stone to build its own identity.
"Jul 17, 2020",POSITIVE," ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away…."" Seeing those words still brings a chill. Whether on a TV or, in this golden new age, up on the silver screen, once again. With the original Star Wars being the first film I ever remember seeing in a theater, at the impressionable age of three, this franchise has been a major part of my entire life. Seeing that sentence, with its extra-dotted ellipsis, in front of The Last Jedi brings equal parts overwhelming nostalgia and nervous anticipation at what's to come. General Leia Organa's (Carrie Fisher) Resistance has been forced to evacuate their base, and they incur a number of casualties in the initial attack by the First Order fleet. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega), along with a new friend Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), have devised a plan to disable the main First Order ship. Because of Poe's rash decision making, their standing in the eyes of the Resistance leadership has diminished, so they must execute their plan in secret. Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley) has found Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). What began as a mission to convince Luke to join the fight soon becomes a journey of self-discovery, for both. Rey must figure out what this power is that she feels inside her, and why it keeps connecting her mind with Kylo Ren's (Adam Driver). Luke must try to reconcile his feelings about the history of the Jedi Order and his own place in that story, all while attempting to show this girl what it means to be connected to the Force. The Last Jedi is not only the longest entry in the saga, clocking in at two and a half hours, it is also the densest in relation to story. Being, essentially, the bridge film for this trilogy, a lot happens, building and expanding all those characters we were introduced to in The Force Awakens. So much is going on in this film, at times, that it may feel like you need more than one viewing to really take it all in and figure out everything. That's not a bad thing, since writer/director Rian Johnson (Looper, Brick) has given us a breathtaking visual spectacle to go along with his plot, one which respects the viewer's intelligence and doesn't just hand-feed you. It's not just the characters that get a dose of expansion, but the saga as a whole. We are treated to new ship designs, new species and new locations, all of which serve to give a broader sense of what goes on outside the tiny capsule of conflict. It reminds us that what we're used to seeing in these films is only a tiny section of a vast universe. As J.J. Abrams did with The Force Awakens and A New Hope, Johnson liberally borrows from the previous films. He mostly takes elements from The Empire Strikes Back, this entry's spiritual cousin, but also includes parts of Return of the Jedi. Also like the previous entry, this doesn't detract from the film, as Johnson reworks these pieces of the story and rearranges them in a clever way. He also takes full advantage of the how far visual effects have come over the years. George Lucas has mentioned he took inspiration from several places in creating the Jedi. To me, the one on that list that has always stood out as the main influence was the samurai. Johnson appears to feel this, as well, taking cues from classic Japanese films. This is not only used during the student/master sequences between Rey and Luke, but also when he gives us a fantastic take on the samurai vs. ninjas fight scene the way only a Star Wars film could. In the end, The Last Jedi answers many of the questions brought up in The Force Awakens, while creating some new questions of its own. First and foremost: Where does the story go from here?

"Jul 1, 2020",POSITIVE," After the shameless remake of Star Wars (1977, aka Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope) that was Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015, aka Star Wars: Episode VII—The Force Awakens), which came roaring into theaters with a bad aftertaste of manufactured PR, the newest installment offers the world an action-packed, technically excellent, mythically present, humorous, and (never thought I’d say this of a Star Wars film) thematically radical entry in the four-decade-old original space opera saga. . . .  At least, that’s how I thought I’d be starting this review as I was walking out of the cinema. Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017, aka Star Wars: Episode VIII—The Last Jedi) is a great film, but is it a great film? Is that even a fair question to ask of just one-eighth of an epoch-making tour de force of imaginative world-creation and archetype-wielding narration? In other words, how fair can you (or I) consider this review to be, given that merely reading the opening crawl had me in tears, and that I’d been following the YouTube press tour so closely that I kept thinking of the on-screen characters by the name of their actors (Vice Admiral who?)? Richard Brody, arthouse champion and bugbear of the popular cinema, calls this film “an elaborate feat of fan service,” and he’s not wrong—even the newfound humor just reveals it to have gone all-out Marvel. He’s not alone: Matt Zoller Seitz, in his masterful review at the Roger Ebert website, also mentions fan expectations and makes a Marvel reference. (Editor’s note: So it’s ironic that, apparently, half of the fandom hates its guts.) The bigger question, though, is where you would find someone who cares about this eighth out of nine (and possibly twelve) films who isn’t a fan? A similar question hovers over Brody’s conclusion that, in its militaristic upholding of the virtues of hope, freedom, and resistance, the film is formally closer to the fascist New Order. Again, right on the money, but as revolutionary theorists from Lenin to Badiou have pointed out, rebellions against authoritarian (or monarchical) dictators prevail in the face of long odds primarily on the basis of their discipline and conviction. Dunno if that’s a contradiction, but it’s history. So the film is ineluctably constrained by its genre and universe conventions, and so plot-centric that I kept waiting for the inevitable cliffhanger ending à la The Empire Strikes Back (1980, aka Star Wars: Episode V—The Empire Strikes Back). Also, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) kills Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) using Occlumency (prove me wrong, I dare you). But the film fills up all the available space within these boundaries—and even breaks through a couple times. Brody mentions the mirror scene and Carrie Fisher’s performance (perhaps out of respect for her, he skips over the part where the shot composition of Leia’s return to the carrier first resembles Superman in space absorbing the rays of the sun, before quickly devolving into a 2D platform shooter). The biggest, bravest, and most radical thing the film does, though, is that it embodies the lesson that Yoda (Frank Oz) imparts to Luke (Mark Hamill): embrace failure. The entire film is premised on a retreat—Dunkirk in space, if you will—and of all the schemes and plans and subplots and side-missions that are played out, the only one that succeeds is Rey’s (Daisy Ridley) bringing Luke back into the fight. Kylo Ren is still on the Dark side, Finn (John Boyega) and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) are captured and betrayed by Benicio del Toro (what’s his character’s name again?), no Resistance bases are left standing, the only ship still spaceworthy is the Millennium Falcon, which wasn’t part of the Resistance convoy to begin with, and even Luke enters a higher realm (read: dies) at the end. And we don’t even have Carrie Fisher anymore. All of this just adds ladles of emotion to the final line: Having lost so much, Leia consoles Rey by assuring her, “We have everything we need.” Camera pull upward. Though, for my money, the absolute hands-down best line in the film is when Luke guides Rey to truly understand the force for the first time, and he asks her, “In between [everything], what do you feel?” and she says, “I feel . . . a force.” It’s A New Hope all over again."

"May 29, 2020",POSITIVE," BY DAN TABOR FILM CRITIC With Thursday’s release of Star Wars: The Last Jedi  director Rian Johnson picks up the reigns of the space opera mega-franchise left by J.J. Abrams.  Given the bleakness of Looper and cleverness of Brick, I was more than a bit curious to see what Johnson would do in the Disney® sandbox. Surprisingly enough not only did Johnson make it through making the film without being fired — no small achievement, that — but he turned in a film that feels very much like a Star Wars adventure while adding a much-needed layer of complexity to the characters we met all too briefly in The Force Awakens. Since the decimation of the Republic’s capital at the end of The Force Awakens, the First Order has established dominance over the galaxy. When we catch up with the final remnants of the Republic — the de facto Resistance — led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), they are on the run from the ominously reptilian Supreme Leader Snoke and his terrifying star fleet of mega-destroyers, who are on the cusp of wiping out the Resistance once and for all. In a plot point that feels cribbed from an episode of Battlestar Galactica, The First Order now has the ability to track the Rebel fleet through their lightspeed jumps making it only a matter of time before the Resistance fleet runs out of fuel and is overtaken by the First Order. It’s a race against time as Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac),  Finn (John Boyega) and newcomer Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) cobble together a plan to sneak onto Snoke’s ship to shut off the tracking device just long enough for the Resistance fleet to slip away. In the meantime, Daisy Ridley’s Rey finds she has a much more daunting task ahead of her, trying to convince Luke Skywalker — who, fed up with intergalactic warfare, has self-exiled to the last redoubt of the Jedi on the oceanic planet Ahch-To —  to help the Resistance and train her in the in the ways of The Force. It’s very apparent Rian Johnson was having the time of his life here. The film is pure visual spectacle, with bigger space battles, more lightsaber duels and higher stakes; all barbed with a razor sharp humor. I can also see why Mark Hamill probably sat out the first film; he is a formidable presence on screen and here he often eclipses the young Ridley with his darkly humorous take on the exiled Jedi master. This dynamic plays into how we come to see this war between the Rebellion and the First Order and the conflict between Jedi and the Sith. It’s not simply black and white, but shades of gray. And sometimes the good guys do bad things. The film begins with a tragic example as Poe Dameron’s ego leads to the death of hundreds of rebels when he disobeys orders and takes on a massive First Order Dreadnought. These sentiments are later echoed by the career criminal DJ (Benicio Del Toro, who revisists the twitchy incomprehensibility of his breakout performance in The Usual Suspects) who lets our Resistance friends in on a little secret: there are those that have been profiting obscenely off of this war, selling arms to both sides, who have a vested interest in keeping it going as long as possible. After that aforementioned spectacular opening battle sequence, The Last Jedi stumbles a bit trying to find its footing and advance the narrative all the while tying up all the loose ends left over from The Force Awakens. Once the film digs in however it delivers a story that proves to be more original and satisfying watch than its predecessor. It almost feels like Rian Johnson had most of the same issues with The Force Awakens we did — that it leaned too hard on the fan nostalgia crutch — and nowhere is this more apparent than when Snoke — who looks like a burn ward victim in a fancy bathrobe — berates Kylo Ren (the always excellent Adam Driver) for failing to vanquish Rey in the previous installment, belittling him as a Vader wannabe. J.J. Abrams is slated to direct the final installment in the Star Wars re-boot trilogy but after seeing how impressively Johnson course-corrected the series and cleared the board for the imminent endgame of the Skywalker saga, I’d rather see him finish what he’s started. The Last Jedi isn’t perfect but is easily everything a Star Wars fan could want that expands the SW universe into bold new realms while deftly invoking the films we love and remember from a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away."
"May 20, 2020",POSITIVE," There were a few minutes after I finished watching Star Wars: The Last Jedi where I had to keep reminding myself that there is at least one more movie coming in this saga that has occupied 40-some-odd years of my life. I promise to make this review spoiler free (though plot points are discussed), but the fact is that writer-director Rian Johnson (Brick, Looper) has done a remarkable job making The Last Jedi a film that somehow both stands on its own and fits wonderfully into an ongoing journey, and still feels like its own conclusion of sorts. He fills in details that have remained mysteries since The Force Awakens, leaves a few still lingering, and, most surprisingly, lets us know that some of the things we thought were mysteries, aren’t actually. And in perhaps his boldest move of all, assures us that not everything has to be tied in with what has come before. Still another remarkable achievement of The Last Jedi is that it earns nearly all of its emotional beats on its own merits, and not simply by tapping into the nostalgia well that runs deep in every Star Wars fan. Of course, reunions and revisiting old haunts play a part in this movie. I think the biggest chill I got was seeing Mark Hamill’s aged Luke Skywalker step back into the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon for the first time in decades. You can look into his sunken, sad eyes and see a lifetime of memories.  But there are other moments that are born of this story. For reasons I'm not sure I can explain, I was especially moved by an almost throwaway moment near the end of the film, when Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) come face to face and we quickly realize they’ve never actually met before, despite having been such integral parts of the fight against the Empire 2.0 (known as the First Order). Their reputations precede them, so the meeting should be little more than a formality, but there’s a shared respect that passes between them in the moment that is palpable. With a running time of two-and-a-half hours, The Last Jedi has room to stretch its storytelling legs and let all of its many main characters have more than just moments; each is allowed to enter their own adventures, and the result is a series of fulfilling story arcs that culminate in a film that doesn’t so much set up an Episode IX as it does open up the possibilities of where future Star Wars stories might take us. It’s no accident that the most promising new character Johnson introduces is a young gear head named Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), who, like Rey and former stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega), has been hearing stories of Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher, in her final film role), Han Solo, and their Rebellion for as long as they’ve been alive, using them as a source of inspiration to lead more heroic and bolder lives. Johnson takes the time to answer questions about the past, in particular, the events that led Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), the son of Han and Leia, to his place alongside the rotting corpse and Dark Side purveyor that is Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). Naturally, this is tied into why Luke went missing for decades and now hides out on a Porg-infested island in a corner of the remotest part of the universe.  Johnson allows us to believe that the Luke-Rey section of the film will mirror Luke’s training sessions with Yoda from the original trilogy, but immediately subverts those expectations by having the Jedi master do everything in his power to demystify the ancient religion specifically and the Force in general. He sees that Rey is so lost in the legends that she doesn’t grasp the reality of the pain such power can bring, especially when he tempts her with the Dark Side and she doesn’t seem the least bit hesitant to stroll right toward it. One of the most interesting concepts introduced in The Last Jedi is the undeniable bond between Rey and Kylo Ren. They spend a great deal of the film conversing via a psychic link, and they each take turns attempting to convince the other to cross the line and join them on their side of the Force. Rey thinks she sees good in Kylo (given name: Ben Solo), while he’s sure he sees potential in her to turn dark, and it’s this push and pull that serves as the beating heart of the film, culminating in an epic and especially brutal, face-to-face battle in the Snoke’s chamber. Once again, Johnson wants us to think this is a replay of the Return of the Jedi clash that pitted Luke, Darth Vader, and the Emperor; but trust me, it is not. There’s a nearly film-long space battle between First Order forces (again led by Domhnall Gleeson’s General Hux) and the entire Resistance fleet, led by Leia. When she is injured at one point, the fleet is taken over by Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (an exceptional Laura Dern), who has no issues putting Poe in his place when he questions her intentions. There’s also a fun side story involving Finn and Rose as they must head to what is effectively a leisure planet to find a master codebreaker. Instead, they find a less-than-reputable DJ (a twitchy Benicio Del Toro) whose skills are only outmatched by his devotion to money. These sequences are superfluous on the surface, but it’s fun to see Johnson play with the Cantina concept by giving it a high-end slant. Naturally, series favorites C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2 (Jimmy Vee), and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) are a part of the mix (not to mention John Williams' ever-present, always-soaring score), as are new players like Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong’o) and Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie), but with the exception of a fantastic standoff between Finn and his former commander, Phasma, most of these characters are there more for the vibe than actually contributing to the bigger picture. Which is fine, because there are plenty of characters around to do just that. I loved seeing Poe Dameron get to show us that his judgment isn’t always the most sound. There’s an exchange between him and Hux at the very beginning of the film that might be the single funniest moment of any Star Wars film. Another highlight is the ongoing tension between Rey and Luke, which is never completely resolved, and that actually helps her move forward, beyond her archaic notions about what the Jedi were and might be again. Even if Carrie Fisher hadn’t died a year ago, The Last Jedi in many ways feels like a tribute to Leia and her always undervalued strength. The character was the backbone of this series, and Johnson does a remarkable job placing her front and center when the Resistance needs her most. Knowing we don’t get her in the next movie is perhaps the toughest thing about seeing how phenomenal she is here. After watching The Last Jedi, I’m particularly curious to see where Kylo Ren’s story takes us. There are so many potentially interesting places for it to go, and I remain impressed by Adam Driver’s layered take on this complex villain, who comes across as part emo boyfriend, part broken child. As I alluded to, the greatest thing Rian Johnson accomplishes here is giving us potential, giving us hope that what comes next (perhaps the last film in this saga) will be used as his blocks, building something great upon them. The final shot of the movie focuses on a small moment with unfathomable possibilities, and I can’t think of a greater tribute to the Star Wars universe.

"May 15, 2020",NEGATIVE,This felt much more like a kid's movie to me.
"May 15, 2020",NEGATIVE,This felt like paint by numbers.
"Feb 14, 2020",POSITIVE,Go see it on the biggest screen possible and let the little kid in you enjoy every moment of it.
"Feb 10, 2020",POSITIVE," As satisfying as The Force Awakens was, as the dust settled, it became clear than J.J. Abrams had basically remixed A New Hope for a new generation without bringing new ideas to the fore (heck, Abrams went for yet another Death Star, the most cumbersome of weapons). Considering this development, concerns over The Last Jedi being another Empire Strikes Back weren’t unfounded. Enter Rian Johnson. The writer/director behind the brainy indies Brick, Looper and The Brothers Bloom explores corners of the Star Wars universe never seen before on screen, without breaking the mold. Chief among them, a scenario beyond the battle between good and evil that has characterized the saga. Johnson also takes full advantage of the visual possibilities and deliver the most unique-looking episode of the franchise, without becoming a CGI hodgepodge like the prequels. I won’t be spoiling the plot here. Suffice to say, the Resistance is in shambles. Even without a massive, impractical weapon able to destroy planets, the strength of the Empire is overwhelming. There is also conflict within each side. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) has fallen out of favor with Supreme Leader Snoke, following his defeat at hands of Rey (Daisy Ridley). Among the rebels, Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) can’t agree over the best way to avoid annihilation, with General Hux (Domhall Gleeson) breathing down their necks. Meanwhile, Rey struggles to get Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to rejoin the fray. The Jedi knight is not over the events that led to Kylo Ren switching teams and is not particularly inclined to go through the same motions with another gifted, unruly student. Unlike previous episodes, The Last Jedi relies heavily on the performers and boy, do they deliver. Maybe it’s because of the goodwill generated by her untimely demise, but Carrie Fisher is phenomenal as Leia: The leader of the Resistance is burdened by casualties but her resolve is unshakeable. Mark Hamill is asked to bridge his brash younger self with a cautious, misanthropic present and pulls it off. Of the new generation, Adam Driver is the MVP: More comfortable in Kylo Ren’s skin, Driver makes the character’s tortuous journey believable, even relatable. The movie goes out of its way to present Rey and Kylo as sides of the same coin. They may be in opposite corners, but they recognize in each other a kindred spirit, a connection that pays off tenfold. There are several of these dichotomies peppered through the film, which serve to explore the nature of power, the darkness inside all of us and the generational divide. The Last Jedi has a conflicted relationship with the past, both at internal and meta level. There is a desire to break with it, but at the same time, an acknowledgement of its tremendous power. The tension that comes from these opposing forces serves the movie well.  Whatever side you stand, you can see the appeal of the other. The quality of the space battles has improved exponentially. Rian Johnson -who has already been tapped for a new trilogy set in the Star Wars universe- brings new elements to skirmishes between rebels and the Empire. The opening dogfight is one for the ages. Overall, this is a profoundly satisfying episode without apparent weak spots (it’s a notch disjointed, but nothing unbearable): You’ll laugh, cry and be in awe, which is more you can say of any movie out this decade. There is a question The Last Jedi presents that has escaped every other Star Wars installment: Who benefits from the conflict between the Empire and the Resistance? The answer is as pedestrian as is topical, and has the potential to blow the franchise wide open. Four out of five planets."
"Jan 16, 2020",POSITIVE,"It is the most visually stunning of the eight Star Wars films, the characters speak with the elegance and wit... and the acting is often outstanding. It is exciting, funny, cute, tense, melancholy, smart, goofy, unexpected, and occasionally profound."
"Jan 10, 2020",POSITIVE,"Most fans will enjoy The Last Jedi but it won't be for everyone. While well crafted, the current batch of main storyline SW films feel a little hollow"
"Dec 24, 2019",POSITIVE," Undeniably the most divisive of the Star Wars franchise, The Last Jedi sought to challenge the very foundations of the property. Building off of the events of The Force Awakens, director Rian Johnson chose a different path than many of the films that came before. Yet at the same time, his mechanisms for crafting the story created the rhyme that remains essential to the franchise. Discarding the “planet-destroying” monstrosities that have plagued most of the franchise, he instead focused on character development and philosophy. This Empire Strikes Back illusions are heavy throughout the film, especially as the characters are pulled in different directions. However, the “kill the past” message reigns supreme throughout the film. How that message has been interpreted is another matter entirely, but it provides the groundwork for a future Star Wars with incredible hope. The Last Jedi begins moments after The Force Awakens. Poe (Oscar Isaac) leads a raid on an Imperial Dreadnaught, taking down a dangerous weapon for the First Order. As General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) looks on, she orders the evacuation of the other ships in the fleet. Among those evacuated are an unconscious Finn (John Boyega) and a young engineer named Rose (Kelly Marie Tran). The First Order, led by General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) tracks the resistance through hyperspace, leaving the Resistance on its last legs. Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) continues to spark hate in Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), pushing him to his emotional limits. Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley) has found Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) on a distant planet. Unfortunately, he refuses to train her in the ways of the Force. The emotional core of the film comes from Ridley, and Johnson quickly establishes an unconventional nature to her side of the story. He fully embraces the Luke parallels within the character, including her ambition and excitement to receive training. He knows that Ridley comes across as an infectious performer. She needs to belong to something bigger than herself and having the ability to utilize the Force has always sparked an internal examination. Its only fitting that Rey’s involve the biggest hole in her heart, and wanting to belong can often stem from knowing where you come from. Johnson cuts the core with the answer of “no one,” a liberating and emotionally devasting choice all at once. Yes, it means that Rey’s central quest to find her parents will never be solved. However, it means she can be free to pursue her own destiny, one that means she can define herself by those she loves and those she chooses. In a more practical sense, it means that anyone can a savior. Anyone can be a hero. You don’t have to come from privilege or legacy to pave your own way forward. In an age of populism, this particular story rings true. It also builds upon a heartbreaking choice from The Phantom Menance. It does not say that midichlorians are necessarily irrelevant, but it does not mean that only the select few in the galaxy can use the power of the force. Meanwhile, Driver delivers the best performance of this franchise to date as Ren. While I saw him as an unstable and broken character for most of The Force Awakens, Driver transcends the story in Last Jedi. Rocked by a master that still sees him as weak, his connection with Rey deepens both characters. You can see his manipulation at work, showing how his point-of-view diametrically opposes the truth. Yet Driver turns on the charm. He’s slick and raw. Johnson’s choice to dump the Kylo mask means we actually get to see one of the most emotive actors deliver emotional dialogue. He knows he must stand-in for Vader, so his physical presence can overwhelm the screen. Driver’s textured take on a man broken from his own actions, seeking someone to understand him becomes empathetic. But he always comes home. He may not be beyond redemption, but he also holds an unsafe level of influence over our hero. That makes him the most dangerous man in the universe. Returning to the role of Luke, Hamill gives the most introspective performance of his career. He locks into something beautiful about the character at the edge of the world. He has followed the footsteps of his masters, and like both Yoda and Obi-Wan, he chose exile over facing the problems head-on. After freeing the galaxy, he plunged it back into darkness. His failure destroyed everything his friends had lived, fought, and died for. Hope has been extinguished, and for the entirety of the film, Hamill gets to charm his way back into your heart. Even as grumpy and frustrated force wielder, he remains funny and weird. He was never the traditional hero, but a nerdy kid who starred into the suns hoping to find something better for himself. He was the embodiment of George Lucas as he created the franchise, a young boy in California who would rather work in movies than for his father. Like Lucas, he created something reviled, something inherently broken, and was forced to leave it all in the hands of someone else. Yet failure does not stop a legend from continuing to be a spark for hope. Johnson’s dissection of Luke reminds us that while the worlds and stories we create can be inspiring, the important thing is for the next generation to build on what we’ve built. We do not ignore what came before, and instead, use that failure as a way to push beyond what we’ve accomplished. Just as Luke learns from the failure of Vader, Rey too must learn from the failure of Luke. The film’s dialogue never disposes of the past but reframes the way we look at what came before, and the exciting prospects of what can come next. It’s an eternal message, one that deserves to be delivered by one of the great cinematic characters. Hamill’s pathos and heart can be read on his face throughout the film, and while he struggles with his own failure, you can see the hope reborn. His final moments on-screen feel impossibly beautifully, impossibly sentimental, and fit the rhyme of Star Wars. No character in the franchise has ever received a more impactful farewell. On the flip side, the Resistance does its best to survive. Regardless of where you sit on the Leia utilizing the Force sequence (a scene that feels like we’ve been building towards since Return of the Jedi), this section defines why we fight against oppression. Simply painting the world as good guys and bad guys do not create personal stakes for our characters. Isaac begs the audience to see him as the new Han Solo, but he needs to grow into the role. Before this moment, we’ve barely even met him, and allowing him to contrast himself with Hondo and Leia offers that growth. Meanwhile, Finn has never given a reason for why he would join the Resistance. The only motivation he reveals throughout The Force Awakens comes from his feelings for Rey. He was 100% against the First Order, but he was never for the cause. The scenes with Rose, especially those at Canto Bight, snap several political realities into place. First, it directly pushes up against the idea of the rich, or in many cases corporations, caring about the cultural ideologies that play out in public. Anyone can sell anything to any side. After all, Republicans buy sneakers too. It’s a harsh reality, but one that feels undeniable as consumerism and activism continue to blend. Boyega owns the transformation, becoming a movie star in the process. His line reading of “Rebel Scum” will always be his defining moment to me in the trilogy. Tran does not get the strongest dialogue, but her ability to ground the story creates its own benefits. She’s someone who grew up hearing the stories of rebellion and has actually felt the costs firsthand. She believes in heroes and puts herself on the front lines. It’s an admirable character, one that is slightly diminished by a one-sided love subplot. That does not diminish the earnest nature of her role, which in many ways in a non-Force sensitive version of Rey. Yet her message of love and togetherness feels essential, especially as political divides grew deeper within American politics. Finally, the technical aspects of The Last Jedi far outpace any previous entry in the franchise. While the original trilogy did not have the technology to create the images this one does, the creativity Johnson showcases throughout the film creates dozens of brilliant setpieces. The Red Room fight remains one of the greatest fight sequences of Star Wars history. The Holdo Maneuver took the breath out of the theater, creating a visually spectacular shot. The Dreadnaught fight and the battle on Crait provide their own brilliance. Even the little Crystal Foxes and Porgs deserve credit. Johnson unleashed one of the most spectacular visual feats within the Star Wars universe. The use of unique sound, visuals, and production design sprinkled throughout the film makes this one stand out."
"Dec 20, 2019",POSITIVE," In the run-up to the release of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and the end of the Skywalker Saga, we will be taking a look back at all of the Saga films and re-evaluating them and their legacy as a whole. Either a reaction to the creative choices of The Force Awakens (difficult given the production schedule) or an incredibly timely bit of synchronicity, The Last Jedi takes a full look at what Star Wars without its originator could be but is hamstrung by an inability to make up its mind and creative decisions inherited from the previous film. The sequel trilogy was and is weighed down by the desire to both guess what its creator would have done and what its fan base would have wanted. Trying to thread the needle between the two created a backward-looking experience in The Force Awakens, which kept that film from being able to take full advantage of what new things it did invent.  The other side effect of lacking a single guiding hand behind the story is that each new filmmaker has free reign to make their episode what they want it to be, something entirely novel in the series. Working on his iteration simultaneous with J.J. Abrams production, The Last Jedi writer/director Rian Johnson essentially tackles the same questions at the same time and comes to very different conclusions. “Let the past die,” says Kylo Ren, the focal point of Johnson’s thoughts on sequels and franchises. A character who existed in The Force Awakens largely to both impart a Darth Vader vibe to the new films and give Han Solo a dramatic arc, in The Last Jedi, he comes into his own as a fascinatingly compelling character.  Through him, Johnson smashes some of the repetitive fan services of The Force Awakens (usually literally) and makes clear that he understands what Lucas understood – the only way a long-form story can survive is if each edition is intentionally different from the others. Frequently that means taking big whacks at the story structures brought over from The Force Awakens in order to leave something new for the next person coming down the line. [This creates other problems, not the least being that no overriding dramatic structure exists across the three sequel films because no one knows what is happening next or has the time to worry about it. All they can do is leave bread crumbs for the next person to follow and hope they do.] The heroic rebels are nearly wiped out after the flaw of hopeless last stands and reckless plans becomes apparent. The grand leader of the villainous First Order is simultaneously expunged as Johnson realizes the crutch using expy’s of previous characters is. In their place, Johnson takes time to delve deeply into what makes Rey and Kylo Ren tick and build a fascinating relationship between them. The downside of all of this is that it also weakens the structures The Last Jedi itself is relying on. With so much time spent on a new character dynamic, there is less for recurring characters Finn and Poe (who himself is dramatically increased in presence), and what time they do have is focused on The Last Jedi’s thematic pursuits, primarily failure and how it can be learned from.  Which means that they fail again and again and again. It’s fascinating but also unbalanced with little in the saga that doesn’t get subverted. As Owen Gleiberman noted at the time of the film’s release, the problem of taking all the legs out of your mythology is that it will not be there to prop your story up when it is needed. But the real issue The Last Jedi has is that it ultimately lacks the courage of its convictions. As often as it speaks of doing away with the past or simply realizing the past has no power over the present, it refuses to follow the idea to its logical conclusion. The problem is epitomized in the climactic confrontation between Ren and Rey and Supreme Leader Snoke when the two misfit, outcast Jedi seem on the verge of leaving the galaxy to its problems and finding their own way… a truly momentous and unprecedented turn in story which would have left untold options for the final film.  But at the key moment, they don’t. Instead, they merely act as all previous versions of their characters have because they must. Otherwise, there would no longer be scruffy Rebels fighting Stormtroopers, and then what would Star Wars be about? Johnson is canny enough to realize one day we will have to find out, but he is not prepared to make The Last Jedi the film that does so. This is its fatal flaw, as it attempts to have its cake and eat it, too. That problem can be clearly seen in its design elements as well. Some of it is fascinatingly expressive in a way no one but Lucas and Kershner really tried with the series, in particular, the focus on the color red within the palette — sometimes overt and sometimes sub-textually — representing the strong emotional ties, love, and hate, tugging at Kylo Ren and driving the story of the sequel trilogy.  The return of Master Yoda was conceived in Johnson’s words so that it could exactly replicate what was seen in the original films. His other new design elements also replicate those older choices – a particular ask was to make the new vehicles look like they could have been from Return of the Jedi. If the exterior visual vision for the film is kept chained to a certain frame, how can the interior vision grow and change when it’s all stemming from the same point of view? The sequel films, helmed by those who grew up with the series, are trapped in the worship of its iconography. But that kind of worship does not allow for change and reacts violently when it is attempted (a fact both the prequel trilogy and The Last Jedi ran powerfully in conflict with). Lack of change freezes the narrative and leaves filmmakers re-arranging deck chairs rather than moving the plot forward, which is how something like The Last Jedi could end basically how it began [The Resistance in a spaceship running for their lives] with only one film to go to somehow tie up all loose ends. Perhaps if The Force Awakens had been more daring, The Last Jedi itself would have been even freer to experiment. Instead, the expectation was set for nostalgia and safe choices, with the short-term success of that leading to long-term troubles. Dangling plot threads that would have been poisonous to future installments if drawn out — the unknown and unknowable Snoke, the missing Luke Skywalker, the secret of Rey’s parentage — became grenades Johnson had to throw himself onto in order to leave a clear trail for whoever followed him. We’ll never know, and it’s entirely possible the answer would have been ‘pretty much the same’ because this is what happens when an auteur’s vision is turned over to his fans. More than any of the other post-Lucas films, Johnson takes that bull by the horns and truly thinks about what could be different and why. But when the climactic choice comes, The Last Jedi, like Kylo Ren in the throne room, reverts to old habits. “Let the past die,” it says, “but not too much.” Joshua Starnes has been writing about film and the entertainment industry since 2004 and served as the President of the Houston Film Critics Society from 2012 to 2019. In 2015, he became a co-owner/publisher of Red 5 Comics and, in 2018, wrote the series “Kulipari: Dreamwalker” for Netflix. In between, he continues his lifelong quest to find THE perfect tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich combination."
"Dec 20, 2019",POSITIVE," Now having seen the final entry in the Skywalker saga, the time is now to look back on the new era of Star Wars films and see how they hold up. In recent years, constant controversy has stalked the online fandom for Star Wars. With a sudden backlash to Rian Johnson’s film, contrasting to the love from critics was just the start, then came Solo: A Star Wars Story and now The Rise of Skywalker. I have no interest in such puny squabbles of fans pre-conceived notions of what Star Wars is. Judge a film on its merits and a filmmaker too, it’s their choices and its a continuation so changes to lore are valid. You’ve always got the old films if you disagree with new choices made. I am a self-proclaimed Star Wars mega fan, I was brought up watching Star Wars and therefore I believe there can be some trust put into my thoughts? Coming ten years after the last Star Wars film, J.J. Abrams’ The Force Awakens was a nostalgic return to George Lucas’ beloved world. The film is a great success, it captured the feel of the originals while evoking and creating new ideas. However, the narrative feels a little recycled, in that it’s very familiar to that of A New Hope. The Force Awakens is grandly entertaining and riveting, with the piercing new visual and sound effects of the lightsabers, it acted as a surge of Star Wars excitement. It isn’t nearly the best Star Wars entry, it is of middling ground – which says a lot considering how great most of the series’ films are. Another success was the introduction to a whole new series of beloved antagonists and protagonists. Notably, Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Whilst visually it has some intrigue, I believe the biggest flaw is the direction of Abrams, it seems sloppy at points especially in comparison to watching The Last Jedi after. In conclusion, The Force Awakens is a brilliant return to Star Wars that evokes extreme nostalgia and led to a spark that led onto one of the best entries in the Skywalker saga. The Last Jedi, the second entry into the new Skywalker trilogy stirred intrigue after its release and has been much debated for the past two years. Bouncing off from J.J. Abrams’ ending, this film sees Rey attempting to console training with Jedi Master Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Upon re-watching all these films back-to-back you can truly see the mastery of Rian Johnson and his direction. The Last Jedi is not only a fantastic film, but one of the best Star Wars films and could go toe-to-toe with The Empire Strikes Back and A New Hope.  There is something quite poetic to its somewhat relaxed form of storytelling, there is a philosophical aspect to its attempted themes, it feels more like the approach of the originals. Think re-Master Yoda consoling with Luke in The Empire Strikes Back.  The interest in building character over bombastic action (which it does have) is something of an admirable quality. Shot by Rian Johnson’s go-to cinematographer Steve Yedlin, the images they create are sincerely breathtaking and beautiful. The careful and calculated touch of their collaboration when seen in comparison to the more Blockbuster-coverage-type style of shooting in the prior film, clearly shows a mastery in visuals that The Last Jedi has. Rian Johnson’s film is clearly superior in filmmaking and upon re-watch holds up incredibly well as a film, but also as a Star Wars entry. It’s beautiful, breathtaking and poetic in execution, clearly marking the best in the new trilogy. The final entry in the new trilogy has arrived and The Rise of Skywalker is a great end to the new saga. Taking a little while to get used to the overload of exposition and changes made at the very beginning, it gets better and better. It is perhaps the most Star Wars-y film since perhaps the prequels? It is nostalgic, touching and head-turning in the crazy steps taken. It represents a progression in J.J. Abrams’ touch on Star Wars, it’s directed better than The Force Awakens, whilst bringing back some errors that Johnson eradicated in his tenure. The matter of its cinematography, with the sometimes sloppy style of coverage shooting shows less control compared to The Last Jedi, but less-so than The Force Awakens. That being said, it has quite frankly some beautiful and chilling imagery that will send surges of chills down your spine. The scope of the film is frankly very vast, in that it has the challenge of creating a satisfying end for all the films, not just its own. Whilst it has occasional vivid scripting errors and the somewhat rushed beginning exposition, it delivers a mostly great storyline of clarity that becomes more and more clear as the film progresses. Some shots will have you screaming in that they REALLY did that? Delivering extreme doses of nostalgia that honestly ends quite perfectly. Despite its flaws, The Rise of Skywalker is a fitting end. J.J. Abrams improves on his prior work in creating a packed finale that is sure to make fans go wild. On a personal standpoint it has been a pleasure to wait year to year for each new entry. It really works as a trilogy and Rian Johnson must be applauded in creating a film to rival the original trilogy, whilst also J.J. Abrams for lighting the spark that ignited this new reign of Star Wars."
"Dec 14, 2019",POSITIVE," Two hours and eighteen minutes into The Last Jedi, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) projects his avatar from across the galaxy to confront Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and save the Resistance. Both times I saw the film theatrically, once in Mumbai, and then in New Delhi a thousand miles away, the image of Luke floating cross-legged, deep in meditation, was met with thunderous applause. This wasn’t just a clever twist for fans of Force magic; for many eastern audiences, the image of the Jedi levitating cross-legged above a mound evokes depictions of Siddhārtha Gautama, the first Buddha, in sculptures and paintings across the centuries.  The climactic reveal of Luke, lost in deep meditation on Ahch-To (the site of his self-imposed exile, where he lives a similarly material-free life), takes the place of the typical “cowboy shot,” where a subject is framed from the thigh-up as they grab their weapon from its holster — a technique Star Wars has used in the past. Instinctively, most audiences in the west know what this image means whenever it appears, especially if it’s accompanied by the camera pushing closer for emphasis (as it does on Rey when she first wields her weapon in The Force Awakens). It’s a precursor to heroic action scenes; a familiar visual shorthand that tickles the senses, as all genre tropes do. But in The Last Jedi, as the camera pushes in on Luke, the shorthand of the climax is an image more familiar to viewers in South and Southeast Asia. For me, the image recalled an enormous statue of the Buddha in the Ajanta Caves, a series of rock-cut Buddhist monasteries built as far back as the 2nd century BCE.  Cross-legged depictions of the meditating Buddha are most often depictions of the revered monk achieving nirvana, a form of deep spiritual understanding in South Asian religions like Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. The latter, now the world’s fourth-largest religion, is believed to have been founded in the 5th century BCE by Siddhārtha Gautama, who most historians agree renounced the material world before embarking upon a journey of learning and teaching until his eventual death; more specific details are harder to verify, though most biographies cite his birthplace as Lumbini — modern-day Nepal. In Buddhist traditions that arose in subsequent centuries, nirvana  (or “the great quenching”) became one of Buddhism’s central tenets, an escape from cycles of death and rebirth, achieved through deep concentration, helping others, and a state of peaceful, desireless living.  However, the contradictory behavior of the Jedi would come to light in Return of the Jedi, when Obi-Wan insists that, in order to defeat the Emperor, Luke must vanquish Darth Vader in an act of physical dominance. This course of action would require Luke to detach himself emotionally from his own father, but it also contradicted the very things Yoda had taught him. “A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense,” Yoda said, “never attack.” By the end of the film, Luke rejects both extremes of the Force equation, neither buying into the visceral hatred of the Dark Side nor following the dispassionate Jedi dogma that would’ve also lead him to violence. After pummeling Vader in a fit of rage, Luke tosses his own lightsaber aside, and offers him a path to redemption. By The Last Jedi, Luke has cut himself off from the Force, having failed to exorcise the darkness in his nephew Ben Solo. In flashback, we see Luke momentarily tempted by both sides of the equation once more: the violent potential within him that the Dark Side could draw out, and the Jedi’s dogmatic call to ascetic detachment in order to vanquish evil. In this moment, as in the moment Luke nearly took Vader’s life, the Dark Side and the ways of the Jedi are one and the same. Luke thinks about (and nearly acts on) killing Ben. He doesn’t follow through, but it’s too late: The betrayed Ben, denied the road to redemption by his own uncle, is set down on a dark path of his own. A second Skywalker villain is created by Jedi zealotry.  With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, the monk directs and inclines it to creating a mind-made body ... He appears. He vanishes. He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space. He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water. He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land. Sitting cross-legged he flies through the air like a winged bird. The Last Jedi’s cut away from the duel to Luke’s cross-legged meditation signals the achievement of a greater, clear-minded understanding. The concept of nirvana ties back to the central Buddhist idea of escaping cycles of life and death, or attaining moksha, i.e. salvation from pain; what pains Luke, it would seem, is the guilt of his failure. In Buddhism, in order to attain this moksha, one must ascend — as Luke does — from ceto-vimutti, a state of simple, desireless living, to pañña-vimutti, the escape from physical suffering through vipassana, or meditation. The term nirvana, when literally translated, means “blowing out,” as in a candle. As Luke fades from physical existence, backed by the sun-drenched horizon, his life ends like a fading flame.  Fittingly, Luke’s enlightenment, and his rejection of Jedi dogma, mirrors the rift between two major sects of Buddhism: Theravada, or the School of the Elders, and Mahayana, or the Great Vehicle. Theravada, the oldest and most orthodox form of Buddhism, teaches the path to nirvana as a strict endeavour embarked upon only by chosen monks living according to a rigid monastic code, whose enlightenment takes precedence over helping others. In response, Mahayana, which arose cir. the 1st century BCE, introduced newer, more lenient teachings considered inauthentic by many Theravadins. It allowed laypeople the chance to walk the path to enlightenment, and placed a greater emphasis on helping struggling humans, even if it meant delaying one’s own nirvana in order to do so (Mahayana, as it happens, was also the origin of Zen Buddhism). This divide also echoes the paradigm of the new Star Wars films, which dramatizes the tensions between the rigidity of bloodline legacy — from Vader to Kylo Ren — and the arrival of an outsider Rey, who uses the Force and upsets the established order. Rey is also a key fixture in the film’s use of Buddhist imagery. Her own moment of enlightenment, while searching for her parents’ identity in the cave on Ahch-To, comes in the form of gazing into infinite mirrors. In some sects of Buddhism, the mirror is considered a point of spiritual reflection; seventeenth century Zen master Hakuin Ekaku considered the mirror a false or illusory reflection of reality. Similarly, the “truth” Rey seeks in these mirrors presents itself first as illusion — two silhouetted figures, perhaps her parents, walking towards her — before finally reflecting the reality of the world as it truly is. In seeing these two shadows merge into her own reflection, Rey, the girl who raised herself on Jakku, begins to accept that it’s neither the phantom parents she clings to, nor idols like Luke or Han to whom she runs, nor Kylo Ren by whom she’s tempted, that will show her her path. It’s something she must forge herself.  Rey isn’t the only important outsider in The Last Jedi either. Rose (Trần Loan) and Finn (John Boyega) help a young stable boy (Temirlan Blaev) on Canto Bight, the Casino city frequented by the galaxy’s war profiteers. The capital is a nexus of violence and materialism, in contrast with the Buddhist tenets of ending suffering (dukkha) and detaching oneself from the material desires that cause it (samudaya). At the end of the film, a young slave boy who finds inspiration in a Rebel ring given to him by Rose, as well as in the legends of Luke Skywalker, appears to use the Force. In an immediate sense, this child is a symbol of the continuing rebellion, the birth of a new generation of Jedi, and like Rey, a spiritual successor in the Skywalker story. But where does the Force go from here, after Luke’s ultimate rejection of violence and the Jedi dogma? With few answers from The Rise of Skywalker, the answer may partially lie with the new live-action Star Wars shows planned for Disney Plus. We’ve gotten a little from The Mandalorian and Grogu. This mute infant, of the same species as the Yoda we know, exhibits sensitivity to the Force, and in his innocent moments, tries to use the Force to heal the Mandalorian’s wounds. The Force as a means of physical healing is a concept yet unexplored by Star Wars, though it feels tethered to Luke’s use of the Force as a great vehicle for spiritual healing in The Last Jedi. When the film begins, Luke has taken a dark path akin to Yoda’s didactic prophecy many years ago: “Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. And hate leads to suffering.” But by the end, Luke breaks this painful cycle by finding an alternative to Yoda’s three-pronged mantra, one that echoes the Four Noble Truths of Buddhism, the core of the Buddha’s teachings: Suffering exists. It has a cause. It has an end. And there is a noble path to ending it. The future of the Force, it would seem, lies in the ending of suffering, rather than in answering the call to violence; or, as Rose puts it, “Not fighting what we hate. Saving what we love.” The saga thus far has woven a harmonious fabric, in which Luke Skywalker, the young farm boy from Tatooine who just wanted to be part of something greater, fulfills his destiny by becoming one with the Force. He’s helped along his path by none other than Master Yoda, whose own enlightenment has seen him become one with nature; “We are what they grow beyond,” Yoda tells him, of their Jedi students. “That is the true burden of all masters.” As the saga leans further into Mahayana tradition, the goals of its wise Jedi, and its older generations, are to guide these new heroes — and outsiders — toward their own forms of spiritual understanding.  Luke does not appear in front of Kylo Ren to fight, but to guide others to safety. When his astonishing new abilities are revealed, they are a path to salvation — for Kylo, for the entrapped Rebels, and for the Jedi master himself — instead of bloodshed. When Luke is revealed floating on the mound, the awesome power audiences applauded was not violent fantasy, but a path to peace."
"Oct 18, 2019",POSITIVE," Star Wars: The Last Jedi is so good that it will thrill and surprise everyone from the first generation of fans to its newest recruit. It reaffirm to all the power of the force. This film, as written and directed by Rian Johnson, moves the saga forward dramatically, but in truth, it is all about character. It’s best not to discuss any plot points. Fans already know Luke Skywalker is in the movie, because he’s the biggest character on the one-sheet poster.  Audiences will learn more about the characters they’ve always known and loved, and more about both the sophomore and freshman classes.  As to those from A Force Awakens, Poe, Rey, Kylo, and Finn equally get their chance to shine, and show the complexity and motivations of their characters.  There are also some great new additions to the cast.  Most notable is Kelly Marie Tran as Rose Tico and the dynamic she brings to her scenes with John Boyega. In an interview, Tran talked about why. “From the beginning we clicked during the audition process. I don’t think there’s a better partner anyone could have when you’re going into a movie like this.”  Their chemistry is undeniable. Kelly Marie Tran also talked about the continued theme in the Star Wars Universe of having strong self-aware female characters.  “From the beginning, the Star Wars films have always been groundbreaking in that way.  What keeps people interested is they continue to do so.”  Another new strong female character portrayed by Laura Dern has a very interesting arc we see unfold in what almost feels like real time.  The potential for spoilers dictates no more is said about her role, or that of other Star Wars newcomer Benicio Del Toro, but they fold themselves and their storylines convincingly into the saga.  With all the newer members of the cast, lovers of the franchise can rest easy about the old guard.  Carrie Fisher’s Leia is luminous, as always.  Her swan song took a 1977 ingenue albeit fearless princess, and turned her into both a general, and a powerful wise-woman.   Even at that, it is Luke’s story that is most enriched, having several wow moments that legitimately rival the last act of A New Hope.  As to the expanded diversity in The Last Jedi, it’s not something that hits the audience on the head, but really feels right.  In a story where there is conflict and resistance, it makes sense that those who believe in freedom and equality would be coming from every perspective and gender, as well as a wide variety of alien species.  Visually, the audiences are brought through everything from cityscapes, to deserts, vast galactic spaceships, and desolate island landscapes. Some of the most exciting scenes of dogfights in space take us through such spectacular environments they will make your eyes pop.  Also, as one would expect, there are some spectacular sets, and, as has always been the case for the films of Star Wars, there is a great balance of the real and the digital.  Says Johnson, “We had a huge amount of practical sets for this film. Part of the lived-in feel of Star Wars is something we really wanted to capture.  At the same time, the other end of Star Wars is constantly pushing the envelope in terms of special effects.”   “Rian’s script at first count had something like 160 sets,” said production designer Rick Heinrichs, (Pirate of the Caribbean, Beetlejuice), but they wound up with around 125 sets where it was filmed at Pinewood Studios in England, as well as other locations around the world.  For example, they built a cave that was changed and relit to work for three other settings. There’s so much going on it’s almost impossible to remember the entire story (not that it would be shared in this review..) Which of course, may be a ploy to get audiences all to see it multiple times.  At 2 hours and 23 minutes, it is definitely on the long side, and there are so many plot threads it feels like they could get knotted up in the viewer’s brain.   It’s possible there’s an even better movie that could have been carved out in the editing room.  However,  a shorter film might have sacrificed the strong character development, which is what will remain with fans long after the credits roll. Lovers of Star Wars are incredibly lucky to have Johnson at the helm, who is clearly a super-fan of the saga. He took the stories, archetypes and mythology, and expanded and enhanced it in nearly every way. "
"Oct 10, 2019",POSITIVE,"Get ready to buckle up for plenty of action, tension, twists and surprises in this second installment in the trilogy that picks up from The Force Awakens without missing a beat."
"Sep 26, 2019",POSITIVE," Star Wars: The Last Jedi picks up immediately from where its predecessor The Force Awakens left off, but its attitude and intent could hardly be more different. The Force Awakens had an almost slavish reverence to the past, but The Last Jedi elegantly unburdens itself from such reverence in order to stake out its own identity and explore the grey-er shades of war, failure, and the stories we tell ourselves and each other. Writer/director Rian Johnson is a risk-taker. So when familiar beats happen, it's less like repetition and more like a carefully laid out trap in which the filmmaker can land a good sucker punch. Some will hate the creative choices made, some will love them – some won't know what the heck to make of them. Doubtless that The Last Jedi will reward or punish multiple viewings. And yes, it's still a sugar rush, it's a crowd pleaser, it's Star Wars at its Star Warsiest. Most remarkably, though, is that its subtle brilliance blooms the more you ponder on it. And all this without the film itself languishing in heavy-handed ponderousness. Where The Last Jedi could have easily fallen to such a dreary, ponderous place is in Rey's storyline, in which the young adept seeks guidance from the exiled Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. Far from being the spirited hero we knew, he has been eroded by time, shame and regret. Mark Hamill is simply wonderful as this different Luke Skywalker, and it's difficult not to feel a huge rush of affection the few times Hamill drops the surliness and reveals hints of the bright-eyed young Skywalker who redeemed his fallen father and saved the galaxy. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley, along with Hamill, make for a fascinating and psychologically troubled trio upon which an entire fate of a galaxy depends. As Star Wars has always been about the interplay between light and shadow, tyranny and rebellion, so it is that for as operatic and dramatic as the series can get, it's often self-deprecatingly funny too. The impish sense of humour is a welcome aspect in this most violent instalment of the series yet. Whether it be Luke Skywalker sarcastically fucking with Rey, the twisted Supreme Leader Snoke cruelly chastising his broken-spirited apprentice Kylo Ren (“take off that ridiculous helmet”) or that the fascistic toady First Order General Hux is often the butt of a joke, The Last Jedi keeps a sense of humour amidst the carnage and desperation. Though it's thematically necessary, a slapstick-y detour to a Casino setting undeniably hurts the film's almost perfect pacing and tone. Nonetheless, I loved The Last Jedi. I loved its willingness to go to places that will surely anger legions of fans, I loved that it deepened the charismatic archetypes by exploring their hurts and haunts with deftness and humour, and I loved that Carrie Fisher saved her best for last."
"Sep 2, 2019",POSITIVE,"Brilliantly mesmerizing with a dazzling use of color, the action sequences are perhaps the best they've ever been, and the comedy in the film made a guy who generally rolls his eyes at everything laugh like a fool for two and a half hours straight."

"Aug 5, 2019",POSITIVE," Spoiler Alert! I’m not holding back on any plot points. Based on the box office though, it seems like everyone has watched the movie already.  30-second review: Admittedly, I was never a huge fan of the Star Wars franchise. I always appreciated its place as a corner of modern-day cinema and believe that The Empire Strikes Back is one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time. But I’ve never been a fanboy. The Force Awakens was a fun space romp that was well made, but further highlighted my issues with the franchise. Issues that competing franchise Star Trek seemed to solve a long time ago (in a galaxy far, far away). However, Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi doesn’t only give me a new hope for the franchise. It raises the bar for blockbuster filmmaking the same way that Mad Max: Fury Road did a few years ago and Blade Runner 2049 did this year. The difference is that no matter what, any Star Wars movie is going to be seen. And it’s going to be seen by a lot of people. Whether or not Johnson considered this when crafting the narrative I don’t know, but he has moved the franchise forward in quality and perspective. Before continuing, I want to say thank you to Johnson and Kelly Marie Tran. For the first time in my life, I felt like an action hero. Continuing in the spirit of the franchise, The Last Jedi picks up immediately after the events of The Force Awakens. Rey (Daisy Ridley continues to do great work) has found Luke (Mark Hamill) on an isolated island looking to bring him back to the waning resistance to help empower their forces and to further explore her newfound power with the force. Much of this sounds like The Empire Strikes Back retreaded, but Johnson constantly upends expectations in a way that constantly keeps you guessing.  Hamill has never been better as Luke (he was also great in Brigsby Bear this year). Refreshingly, he’s not the hero that he once was. Hamill famously was unsure about the direction of the character, but eventually came around. I understand why he was concerned. For years he was sold as the undisputed hero of the series, and in this film that is the legend that has persisted. But as the old adage goes, never meet your heroes.  The scenes between Rey and Luke don’t work as well as the rest of the film. However, the theme of the storyline is one that the series has never addressed: what does it mean to be a hero. Rey wants to be a hero, but Luke doesn’t quite believe them anymore. It’s incredibly mature storytelling for a series that has mostly kept its themes surface level. The rest of the resistance is engaging in only what I could call a Mad Max-style chase with the First Order. The theme of what it means to be a hero carries on here, but it also points to a new direction for the series. Star Wars, in spite of its title, has never felt like a war movie. Last year’s Rogue One came close, but The Last Jedi is the first movie to completely feel like it completely embraced the title. The action sequences, which are beautifully directed, visually and structurally feel like war battle sequences.  However, I want to pay specific attention to the opening battle. This is the kind of battle that George Lucas would end the movie on. It’s a triumphant victory achieved in spectacular fashion. Instead, Johnson focuses on the losses of the battle. In particular, he focuses on one resistance fighter’s attempt to drop bombs on a First Order dreadnought. Her ultimate sacrifice is what drives the movie’s narrative. Not her specific sacrifice, but the reason she’s doing it. Johnson is a superb visual storyteller and he makes these scenes feel like they can stand alone. Of course, that emotional arc pays off in the form of Rose (Kelly Marie Tran, a revelation and breakout). Fewer characters were introduced in this film, but of all the new characters in this trilogy, she may be one of the best. Not only does she have a backstory and a complex character arc, she’s an Asian woman. Diversity has never been Star Wars‘ strong suit, thought The Force Awakens did a great job in adding some to the cast, but Rose feels different. Of course, this is coming from someone who is Filipino-American. Still, I’ve never felt like I could be an action hero. However, her inclusion points to another improvement for the series. For the first time, each character feels complex and like they have to make decisions that have consequences. For the entire running time, the resistance has their backs against a wall, which adds stakes to the story. Something that the previous movies never had. The Last Jedi is easily the most consistently exciting film in the series. For fans of Battlestar Galactica, it is reminiscent of the series premiere where fleet must constantly evade their enemies through a series of jumps through hyperspace. Johnson’s direction of the sequences are sensational and the effects are among the strongest of the year. However, what is more interesting is General Leia (Carrie Fisher — she gives a performance that reminds us how far presence can get you in a scene) and her attempt to save what is left of the resistance. Poe (Oscar Isaac), who seems to be the new Han Solo, has the “shoot from the hip” attitude that got our heroes out of more than one sticky situation in the original trilogy. Instead, Johnson makes it a point to highlight the strategic side of the fight. At one point Leia becomes so angry at Poe taking the heroic path rather than the strategic one that she slaps him and delivers the soon-to-be iconic line, “get your head out of your cockpit.” Thematically, the film explores what it means to be a hero through Poe and his contentious relationship with Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern, a standout). More interestingly, though, it also blurs the line between good and evil. As a space western, the Star Wars films have always felt like good vs. evil. The Last Jedi explores what it is to be good or evil as Rey and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) become linked to each other through the force by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), which culminates in one of the best lightsaber battles in the series’ history. Johnson elevates the design of the universe by showing us corners that we’ve never seen before. The casino that Rose and Finn (John Boyega) visit is a highlight. And in the final battle sequence, the salt planet serves as an incredible backdrop for the rebels’ last stand. It’s that kind of visual innovation that the series lacked in The Force Awakens, which just felt like more of the same, even if that same is delightful. Coming from a background of appreciation rather than complete adoration, I never understood the undying love for the series. Well, The Last Jedi made me understand it. I felt emotional during the hero moments because I felt attached for the first time. Partially because I got to know them on a deeper level, but also because people of color and women got a chance to have those hero moments.  They truly saved the day. Will that anger some fans? Yes. But objectively, The Last Jedi is the best Star Wars movie to ever be released. That fact can’t be disputed. It may not be the Star Wars you remember, but change, in the end, is good. And to the fans that are unhappy about the changes or the diversity, I leave you with this: “we’re going to win this war not by fighting what we hate, but saving what we love.” Hey, I'm Karl, founder and film critic at Smash Cut.

"Aug 2, 2019",NEGATIVE," Star Wars es una saga esencial para muchos amantes del séptimo arte. De hecho, tampoco serían tan descabellado calificarla como la más importante de la historia del cine. Sin embargo, cada espectador tiene una relación diferente con ella, desde los que quedaron tan marcados que luego han vuelto a verla decenas de veces hasta aquellos que simplemente no logran entender su éxito. En mi caso fue la franquicia Indiana Jones la que más me impactó durante la infancia y la adolescencia, ya que llegué un poco tarde al universo galáctico creado por George Lucas. Eso no impidió que lograra seducirme, algo que se repitió con el estreno de ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ (‘The Force Awakens’), pero, por desgracia, no ha sucedido en el caso de ‘Star Wars: Los últimos jedi’ (‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi’). No puedo decir que sea mala, sobre todo como entretenimiento, pero sí que ha sido una decepción. Me encantó la noticia del fichaje de Rian Johnson para ocuparse del Episodio VIII, tanto porque había seguido con mucho interés su carrera desde el estreno de ‘Brick’ como por el hecho de que invitaba a pensar en que la trilogía al fin iba a despegar por sí misma. Y es que ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ sí tenía mucho de remake encubierto, pero su utilización era muy eficiente para situar a los nuevos personajes y dejarnos con ganas de saber a dónde nos llevarían sus aventuras. Claro que existía la posibilidad de limitarse a rehacer ‘El imperio contraataca’ ('The Empire Strikes Back'), pero habría sido un error mayúsculo. Por suerte, solamente se toman algunos elementos de la mejor entrega de la saga y se nota los esfuerzos de Johnson por construir un relato con personalidad propia, pero nunca logra dar con las teclas adecuadas para que todo encaje de forma genuina. Dicho de otra forma, los límites de la fórmula son más evidentes que nunca y los intentos de Johnson de hacer la película suya solamente funcionan a veces. Uno de los elementos más destacados es que ‘Los últimos jedi’ es la entrega de la saga que contiene más humor con diferencia. Algunos incluso querrán ver en eso una especie de prolongación de lo que tan bien está funcionado en el caso de los superhéroes de Marvel, pero parece que es más un contrapunto para evitar que la película sea demasiado oscura para un público masivo. Lo curioso es que al mismo tiempo que funciona individualmente acaba restando al conjunto. Repasando todos los golpes cómicos, me cuesta encontrar alguno que no me sacase al menos una sonrisa, toda una sorpresa en el caso de los Porgs, ya que tenía miedo de que me acabasen resultando tan repelentes como los Ewoks. El problema es que no está bien modulado, excediéndose en cosas -demasiadas criaturas en la isla donde está Luke- y aligerando de forma extraña -hay veces que casi da la sensación de rozar lo paródico- situaciones que deberían rebosar intensidad.  Quizá lo más adecuado habría sido limitar ese elemento cómico a lo que acontece entre Rey y Luke, ya que al colarse en otros frentes no solo no consigue dar la unidad deseada, sino que hace más evidente el desequilibrio resultante de separar los caminos de los protagonistas. Y es que me podréis poner todas las pegas que queráis a ‘El despertar de la fuerza’, pero una de ellas nunca será la falta de química entre Daisy Ridley y John Boyega.  Aquí a ambos les toca otros compañeros de baile y el resultado es bastante menos satisfactorio. No sé si el entusiasmo de la primera vez algo ayudó a que me dejasen tan buen sabor de boca, pero aquí eso se desvanece, sustituyéndose el espíritu de la aventura por la necesidad de cumplir su cometido. Aún brillan puntualmente, pero aquí se requiere otro tipo de interpretación de ellos y me duele decir que hay ocasiones en los que resultan un poco monótonos. Eso también se traslada al resto del reparto, donde hay situaciones que no terminan de funcionar -lo siento, Han Solo solamente hay uno, no intentes crear otro y menos si minimizas esa pillería del mítico personaje interpretado por Harrison Ford-, como si les faltara fuerza incluso cuando Johnson quiere elevar la intensidad. Es cierto que no llega a resultar mediocre y que pasas un rato agradable, pero la magia de Star Wars simplemente no está ahí. Se parece, pero no llega. Por el camino encontramos multitud de ideas interesantes como el vínculo que se crea entre Rey y Kylo -él es lo mejor de la película y Adam Driver saca provecho de ello- que ya se adelantó en los avances de la película. De hecho, es entonces cuando ‘Los últimos jedi’ está más cerca de convencerte de que realmente estás viendo ese grandioso entretenimiento que esperabas, pero es que siempre acaba sucediendo algo que rompe el encanto. Desde el humor ¿involuntario? hasta algunas lagunas del guion firmado por el propio Johnson, pasando por una serie de revelaciones que confirman que se ha ido improvisando sobre la marcha. De esta forma, ‘Los últimos jedi’ también fracasa en la necesidad de hacer mejor a ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ rellenando algunos de los vacíos que dejaba la cinta de JJ Abrams. Allí era algo que se podían permitir por todo el camino que faltaba por andar, pero algunas respuestas evidencian falta de preparación y restan tanto a lo ya visto como a lo que presentan aquí. Hay un detalle especialmente llamativo que evita que el mejor momento de la película llegue a ser brillante. Alrededor de todo esto encontramos un espectáculo más reposado en el que Johnson demuestra un gran control de la situación sobre cuándo hay que saltar de una trama a otra, tomándoselo también con calma en la evolución de cada una de ellas. Sobre el papel parece una situación ideal, pero el desarrollo de las mismas está lastrado de entrada por la necesidad de satisfacer las expectativas de una aventura de la saga y al mismo tiempo querer ofrecer algo más. Por desgracia, ese barniz mitológico que siempre ha tenido la saga resulta algo forzado, en parte porque el tratamiento de Luke no está especialmente conseguido. Eso daña a su historia con Rey y va perdiendo interés de forma lenta pero inexorable tras la alegría inicial de reencontrarnos con él. Él no cuenta con el factor “se ha muerto y te echamos de menos” que juega a favor de Carrie Fisher -de lo contrario seguro que estaríamos hablando en otros términos de cierta escena- y te deja claro que el universo realmente requiere dejar morir el pasado. Más allá de eso vuelve a ser impresionante visualmente, recreándose quizá en exceso en algunos detalles porque tenían que estar ahí,  el personaje de Benicio del Toro me intriga y atrapa lo suficiente como para querer reencontrarme con él e incluso en sus escenas menos conseguidas logra mantener un estándar en el que es fácil dejarse llevar y disfrutar. Ese mérito hay que reconocérselo, pero si somos justos, ‘La amenaza fantasma’ (‘The Phantom Menace’) también lo conseguía durante muchos tramos y ha sido vapuleada en infinidad de ocasiones. Por mi parte, me hubiese encantado salir entusiasmado de verla como le ha sucedido a muchos, pero ‘Los últimos jedi’ me deja a medias. Es como si te sucediera algo maravilloso y acto seguido pasara otra cosa que lo anulara. Eso le pasa a la película, que cuando parece que va a despegar hay algo que la devuelve a ser un entretenimiento cumplidor que me deja con menos ganas de ver la siguiente entrega de lo que logró ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ con todos sus defectos. Es verdad que en ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ ya había mucho de producto de masas intentando ir a lo que sabían o al menos creían que iba a funcionar, pero era una aventura mucho más compacta y con todo por delante. ‘Los últimos jedi’ es mucho menos vibrante y así acaban siendo más llamativos los defectos de un guion que quiere traspasar ciertos límites pero pronto llega el golpe de realidad o nostalgia hueca que la devuelve al camino marcado. Sé que quizá he sonado un poco duro en lo que digo de ‘Los últimos jedi’, pero es lo que pasa cuando algo que te encanta te da algo que simplemente te hace pasar el rato y con momentos donde detectas lo que te enamoró en primer lugar. Esto último hace que el sabor agridulce se acreciente y con el paso de las horas también la sensación de decepción. Puede que con el paso del tiempo y los revisionados prefiera quedarme con lo bueno -que lo hay-, pero a día de hoy lo que vi en pantalla me da hasta un poco de pena."
"Aug 2, 2019",POSITIVE," Nadie ha dicho que el fregado con el que se ha encontrado Rian Johnson sea sencillo. Es más, es complicadísimo: la aproximación de J.J. Abrams a la franquicia galáctica con 'El despertar de la fuerza', una plétora de guiños nostálgicos y recuperación de iconos infantiles de millones de fans, pero no muy consistente en otros aspectos, fue aclamada en taquilla y con opiniones de todos los colores entre los seguidores de la serie. 'Rogue One', una propuesta interesante sobre el papel, pecaba de tímida y conservadora, y sobre todo, no dejaba claro en qué dirección quería llevar Disney esta nueva encarnación de la saga. O quizás sí, quizás quería que la saga fuera más de lo de siempre. Rian Johnson, a estas alturas más o menos lo tenemos claro, ha intentado enfocar la serie en una dirección distinta con 'Los últimos jedi'. Lo ha intentado con humor desmitificador. Lo ha intentado con imágenes de una fuerza plástica que rivalizan con momentos icónicos de la trilogía clásica. Todo ello hace de 'Los últimos jedi' una película intrigante y de la que vale la pena hablar. Pero... ¿es suficiente? En nuestro nuevo vídeo hablamos de la película y de si va a ser capaz de hacer olvidar los hitos previos de la serie. Con abundancia de spoilers y entrando en detalle en las secuencias que más nos han gustado y disgustado, damos una cal y otra de arena. Destacamos los momentos brillantes de la película: los personajes, las secuencias cumbre, el cáustico humor que pone patas arriba algunos intocables de la franquicia... Y también le damos donde más duele, que esencialmente es... que 'Los ultimos jedi' es una película de 'Star Wars'. Con ese tonelaje insalvable y, sobre todo, con ese legado absurdo de décadas y décadas de historias acumuladas y de mitología parcialmente contradictoria que hay que respetar. Te lo desmenuzamos todo con efectos de sonido.  Rian Johnson tiene ante sí un desafío de los gordos, pero lo cierto es que su nombramiento para encabezar un futuro a medio plazo de la saga hace que quizás haya que contemplar esta entrega de otra manera. ¿O no? ¿La has visto y te ha horrorizado o todo lo contrario? Hablamos de ello y más en esta videocrítica."
"Aug 2, 2019",POSITIVE," El impacto anual del nuevo plan de Disney por explorar la franquicia comprada en su plan de expansión monopolista es cada vez menos efectivo. En tan solo dos años hemos visto tres películas de 'Star Wars'. Tres batallas espaciales con escudos protectores, maquetas y mate painting digital, láser, cgi y tíos en naves con cascos diciéndose cosas mientras la cámara los recoge en su cabina, desde el mismo ángulo y distancia en el que lo hacía la primera película, allá por el 77. Es natural asumir que las nuevas entregas ya no van a tener la misma carga de sentimiento especial por pura repetición. Incluso la vilipendiada trilogía de precuelas de George Lucas aún albergaba un carácter de evento que las nuevas tratan de imitar, sin conseguir vencer la corriente de evidencia que nos indica que son, al fin al cabo, operaciones gigantes de marketing que pueden jugar a ser cualquier género para copar el mercado cada navidad. Esto es, que una película convencional como ‘Rogue One’ se puede convertir en un blockbuster por el que esperar durante todo un año con la campaña de redes adecuada. Sin entrar en detalles de por qué ‘Star Wars: El despertar de la fuerza’ era mejor película que aquella, se entiende la ventaja a priori de una nueva trilogía que cierra los arcos de los personajes originales y los convierte en piezas del tablero de algo distinto. Y en eso, la película de J.J. Abrams lograba un éxito tremendo, porque, sea o no sea un remake del Episodio IV, lograba conectar al público con nuevos personajes mientras la presencia de Han Solo tenía un sentido como comparsa de la trama principal. Y ‘Los últimos Jedi’ logra, de nuevo, hacer esto. Hace unas semanas, exponía en un pequeño estudio las dinámicas narrativas que hacían del Episodio VII una pieza relevante dentro de la tradición, puesto que su simbolismo, sencillez y funcionalidad narrativa exigía una capacidad de síntesis que parece que se pasa por alto a la hora de analizar el cine comercial de esta categoría. Lo cierto es que su continuación, en la mayoría de aspectos, está a la altura de lo que prometía aquella, e incluso supera expectativas, pero se queda a las puertas de alcanzar un equilibro entre el papel del autor detrás del resultado y su etiqueta galáctica. Para bien o para mal, ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ era una película de ‘Star Wars’ de forma casi pura, pero sucedía que también pertenecía a su autor en un 100%. Planteaba estupendamente un montón de preguntas y en sus dos horas y pico contaba la primera fase del camino del héroe de Rey, la chica a la que seguiremos en las tres películas. El Episodio VIII contesta a muchas de esas preguntas y deja otras en el aire, adrede, pero se alza como una extraordinaria entrega que se muestra valiente en desafiar las ideas preconcebidas de la saga. Muchos comentarios aplauden y ponen de manifiesto esa voluntad renovadora, progresista dentro de una ficción que habla de religiones y dogmas. Ese descaro es valorable, pero ¿es por ello necesariamente mejor? O mejor formulada la pregunta, ¿justifica eso sus dos horas y media de duración? Y claro, la pregunta estrella, ¿Es mejor que ‘El despertar de la fuerza’? Las respuestas no están claras, pero lo cierto es que no es un episodio menos disfrutable e interesante que el anterior. Pero tiene un puñado de problemas bastante cristalinos cuyo peso sobre el resultado final depende de la disposición a hacer la vista gorda de cada uno.  Uno de sus puntos fuertes es la sólida dirección de Rian Jonston. La puesta en escena pulcra y cinemática de Abrams parece casi ingenua, comparada con la proyección visual más barroca y sofisticada del director de ‘Looper’ (2012). Parte de la sangre nueva de su estilo es la concepción de escenas mucho más contenidas en sí mismas, algo no tan habitual en el universo ‘Star Wars’, en el que casi todo se siente conectado. Como ejemplo, el momento en el que una rebelde debe lanzar unas bombas y hace lo que puede para hacer caer el controlador de estas.  Johnson acumula intensidad dramática de vida o muerte a una escena que podría servir para un clímax. Es tremendamente tensa y efectiva, pero en el transcurso de la película repetirá muchas veces el truco, con lo que se genera una textura de tira y afloja en la que parece que cada nueva situación debe ser importante en todo momento durante 152 minutos, dando énfasis a momentos en los que no acaba de pasar nada TAN relevante, como veremos a continuación.  La primera escena de lucha naval es de lo más impresionante visto en la space opera, pero crea un pico de grandiosidad tan elevado, que no le es fácil retomar el vuelo durante el resto de la película. Claro que esto también es achacable al riesgo que supone elegir contarnos la caída de los rebeldes. Es la primera vez en estas películas en la que hay una sensación de derrota constante, de que ninguno de los planes sale bien. El clímax es la aparición de Luke Skywalker y su enfrentamiento con Kylo Ren, colocado como apuesta final en el cierre de la película, pero no hay una batalla como tal, sino una huida. El desarrollo también sigue la transformación de los dos personajes clave, Kylo Ren y Rey. El primero tiene un cambio de rol final satisfactorio e importante, sin embargo, el tratamiento de Rey es menos completo. Ahora todas sus intenciones son cambiar a Ren, olvidándose de su formación, y centrándose en tratar de encontrar su papel. Pasa la mayoría de la película hecha un lío con lo que su peso en el entramado se desplaza por la presencia de Luke, y además se nos presenta como una potencial víctima del lado oscuro, al que logra vencer, sí, pero que surge un poco de la nada, como excusa errónea para darle un arco en un personaje que irradia bondad. Los dilemas del héroe en el nudo deberían cambiarle, dejarla en otro punto, dejar una gran revelación en el aire, confrontarnos y confrontarle… pero al final  no hay un vuelco que convierta su periplo en algo extraordinario, salvo haber confirmado los poderes que vimos en el anterior capítulo. Un camino que, quizá, no está a la altura de las expectativas que creaba la anterior película, pero en compensación, hay una resolución muy hermosa de los problemas que han llevado a Luke a esa posición de aislamiento.  De nuevo, es valiente al plantear a un héroe viejo, cansado, que no llega a forjar una relación maestro-alumno verdadera con Rey. No como Obi-Wan con él. No como Yoda. El momento más intenso y enternecedor de toda la película, por cierto, es la aparición del maestro verde para darle una última lección a Luke, es a través de los ojos de maestro en el momento en el que vemos al mismo joven con dudas, destrozado y encontrado de nuevo. Un regalo para el personaje que se cierra con una aparición final grandiosa, un momento crucial para la resistencia, pero no tanto para Luke, que se ha recuperado de lo suyo solo a medias. Su carga, la culpa, es otro elemento para reafirmar las teorías renovadoras de Johnson. No existe el blanco y negro, o el bien y el mal establecido en el nuevo lore de este universo. Se atreve a pintar de gris el currículum del Jedi con un acto contado en tres versiones diferentes, para acabar dibujando un fugaz intento de asesinato, aunque de intenciones nobles,  del cual se arrepiente nada más pensarlo. Nos cuesta imaginarlo en el hombre noble que hemos conocido, pero es uno con la idea de la película, aunque tenga que aparecer Rey, con un discurso típico de sitcom de los 90, para subrayar que no pasa nada, que lo importante es que no llegó a hacerlo. Todo ello nos lleva al emotivo final, con Luke desapareciendo como Obi-Wan, disolviéndose en la fuerza tras haber encendido “la mecha de la rebelión”. Un instante duro, pero bellísimo, que deja otro plano exquisito para un sacrificio comprensible en lo literal, tan abstracto como la salvación de la humanidad gracias a la muerte de Jesucristo. Un toque mesiánico para Skywalker que no sorprende en una película con varias referencias bíblicas.  Podría ser de esperar que el Jedi se le aparezca a Rey en la siguiente entrega, al menos para darle esa tercera lección que queda en el aire, ¿Tendría sentido? ¿Han llegado a ese punto de interacción de padawan y maestro? Si llegara el momento es probable que quede extraño, pero si no aparece ¿Eso ha sido todo? ¿Eso es todo lo que teníamos que ver de Luke Skywaker? Sí, la nueva trilogía quiere romper con el pasado, pero también podría haber sido una buena oportunidad para saber algunos porqués, y qué ha estado haciendo en estos años. Desde luego, dan ganas de aplaudir con las orejas en su último truco de picaresca Jedi, pero no deja de ser un final conflictivo para el personaje. La muerte de Han Solo tiene relevancia posterior para el villano de la trilogía, debemos de esperar al último capítulo para comprobar el legado de esta desaparición. El papel de Leia, por otra parte, se ve reducido por un golpe que la deja fuera de combate la mayoría de la película, pero resulta bastante insatisfactorio que no llegue a tener un cara a cara con su hijo en ningún momento.  Cuando su hermano le dice que no hay opciones de salvar a Ben y que lo va a combatir a muerte, o en el momento que nota su presencia cuando el muchacho está a punto de disparar a su nave, Leia es una madre preocupada, se aflige como si su niño no hubiese aprobado en el programa ‘Hermano mayor’, pero lo cierto es que si ella también tiene la fuerza, ¿Por qué ni un intento de conectar con su hijo? O al menos alguna nota familiar previa que nos ayude a entender cuando el chaval descarrió. Hay mucho más que aportar en ese personaje que un vuelo a lo ‘Gravity’ (2013). Desde luego, ninguno de esos son problemas importantes a nivel de ritmo o estructura. Por lo general, se mantiene más o menos fiel a su espíritu transgresor, y logra muchos momentos de altura , pero, mientras ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ tenía un desarrollo trepidante y ascendente, en ‘Los últimos Jedi’ hay un bloque por el que es difícil cruzar sin levantar los pies enfangados. Y el gran escollo de este segundo acto no es difícil de detectar: el plan. El plan de Finn y Rose es totalmente peregrino. No es fácil del todo entender que medio de una situación desesperada, se les encargue ir a buscar a un MacGyver de ida y vuelta para poder desactivar el típico cacharro de la nave de los malos, es que parece que, en esa miniaventura dentro de la principal, se ha acercado el Lucas más borracho de CGI a echar una mano con la segunda unidad. Un planeta-casino, una estampida de llamas con orejones y un uso de BB-8 totalmente improbable, deshaciéndose de todos los enemigos lanzando monedas que le han metido confundiéndole con una máquina, ¿En serio? Probablemente, esos momentos estén cerca de los más bajos de una saga que, se supone, nos estaba queriendo hacer olvidar que R2-D2 volaba. La cosa no mejora cuando el robot-pelota se pone a manejar un AT-ST. No acompaña tampoco lo lejos de lo espectacular del tratamiento de un puñado de nuevos personajes, que no hacían ninguna falta, como Rose y el ladronzuelo de Benicio del Toro. Su quítame allá esas pajas por un medalloncito de un metal extraordinario no importa. Al menos, el interpretado por una siempre brillante Laura Dern tiene un peso mayor y su final le da más sentido a su aparición. Pero con un puñado de personajes de trilogías anteriores, más los incorporados en ‘El despertar de la fuerza’, dudosamente hacían falta más piezas en el tablero. Esto solo consigue embarullar más esa segunda fase, en la que nos hartamos de ver el escudo de protección de la nave rebelde recibiendo disparos láser. Y cuando parece que todo empieza a moverse, tenemos una huida de pequeñas naves rebeldes volviendo a recibir tiros durante otro buen rato. Una situación un tanto repetitiva que suena a excusa deliberada de guionista para ganar tiempo mientras se colocan las cosas en orden para el tercer acto. Mientras ‘El  despertar de la fuerza’ era fiel al corsé de no utilizar chistes que impuso George Lucas, sí utilizaba el humor como tejido conectivo de su tono jovial, aventurero y dicharrachero. No pretendía lograr la carcajada sino hacer que sus personajes ganaran carisma o la mantuvieran, como en el caso de Han Solo, un ejemplo perfecto de que el humor de la saga siempre ha sido muy tontorrón. Un humor de mímica, heredero del cine mudo, con más que ver con la cinemática y la ocurrencia. El humor de Johnson, sin embargo es más premeditado. Para bien o para mal, introduce el chiste prohibido. Hay una mayor sensación de autoconsciencia, frente a la ingenuidad encantadora del ‘Episodio VII’. En ocasiones parece que quiere entrar directamente en la comedia pura, paródica. Como bien dice mi compañero John Tones, recuerda a un humor más propio de ‘La loca historia de las galaxias’ (Spaceballs, 1987), con algunos gags desmitificadores, muchos cargados de brillante ironía, que rompen la solemnidad de momentos tan intensos como el final de la anterior, irremediablemente condenado a perder su mística al retomarla, tras ver la reacción de Luke en este otro. Son golpes, la mayoría de veces afortunados, pero que en ocasiones pueden empachar. El humor, fuera de las frases ingeniosas, tiene algunos de los gags en el límite del desconcierto. El tono crea un caldo de cultivo para que momentos que no parecen diseñados para crear ese efecto, resulten en cierta manera perversa, bastante divertidos, como ese momento en el que Luke descubre a Rey y Kylo haciendo “manitas” psíquicas y entra como si fuera un monitor que ha pillado a dos adolescentes del campamento cohabitando en una tienda de campaña. Lo que nos lleva a otro tema que estaba implícito y aquí se consolida. La relación de Rey y Kylo que se establecía con montajes paralelos e intercambios de miradas en la anterior, es implícitamente sexual. A través de símbolos como la mano mojada de Solo, su aparición a torso descubierto, o la lágrima de Rey al tocar el dedo de Ren, puede palparse la atracción de esos dos polos opuestos en cada una de sus apariciones juntos. Rey parece determinada a repudiar a Ren, pero acaba acercándose a él, y luchando codo con codo en un giro sorprendente y valiente. Cuando se retoma el conflicto, una explosión resuelve el momento a las bravas, pero por el camino deja un planteamiendo de héroe y villano complejo, y tremendamente interesante. Algo que ha creado incomodidad entre el fandom son las distintas afrentas hacia el legado de Lucas. Aunque pueden tomarse como un corte de mangas de autor, en realidad tienen algo de movimiento industrial, un ardid de Disney para ir preparando al mundo a un nuevo universo de ‘Star Wars’ en el que no va a haber contactos con la historia que ya conocíamos. En realidad, en ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ ya se hacía esto de forma simbólica con la muerte de Solo y un clímax en el que se apostaba exclusivamente por los nuevos personajes en una pelea a tres. Sin embargo, aquí se trata de verbalizar. Se repite en boca de los personajes, a los que solo les falta romper la cuarta pared para azuzarnos contra la nostalgia. Si en la de Abrams el elemento de nostalgia se materializaba, sobre todo, en un sable láser y el Halcón Milenario, ‘Los últimos Jedi’ va más a la encía con los dados de la suerte de Han Solo o el holograma vintage de la princesa Leia saliendo de R2-D2, (sí, el de ‘ayúdame Obi-Wan’). Además, tenemos aparición del Yoda marioneta, el de toda la vida, de nuevo para reivindicar lo antiguo frente al de las precuelas y en el momento climático, cuando Luke se difumina, ocurre en un atardecer de dos soles como los de Tatooine.  En su voluntad de cortar con los clichés, la afición por sacar estrellas de la muerte tan caricaturesca parece haber acabado. Pero, sin embargo, no han podido resistirse en hacer una mención bastante gratuita, cuando un ariete láser aparece en los momentos finales, y Finn, que conoce de primera mano el arsenal del imperio, se refiere a él como una “mini-estrella de la muerte”. A la fuerza rogando y con el mazo dando. Y eso que no hemos entrado en el factor ‘reboot’. Se ha comentado en muchas ocasiones que ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ tiene muchas similitudes con el ‘Episodio IV’ de la saga, y es sencillo comprobar ciertos aspectos de la trama que discurren de forma similar. Pero, aunque la plantilla de trabajo fuera la misma, había un énfasis diferente en cada uno de los elementos que conformaban el tablero, de modo que ninguno de ellos tenía el mismo peso en ambas películas, el foco apuntaba a lugares diferentes, por mucho que uno se empeñe en encontrar similitudes. En ‘Los últimos Jedi’ la trama que narra cómo los rebeldes son casi aplastados parece nueva. Como hemos comentado, hay un espíritu renovador consciente, muy machacado en el guion. Pero, de nuevo, lo está escrito en el texto no siempre se prodiga en la práctica. Se puede interpretar de muchas maneras su intención, sí, pero lo cierto es que la película de Johnson no es menos “remake” que la de Abrams, aunque lo esconde de forma más o menos audaz. Al igual que el ‘Episodio VII’, no por ello deja de ser una obra casi sobresaliente, pero el ejercicio de reciclado de ‘El imperio contraataca’ y ‘El retorno del Jedi’ es bastante evidente. El elemento más claro, obviamente, es el entrenamiento Jedi en la isla del origen de la orden, que hace las veces de Dagobah. El ritual sigue un camino similar al que vimos en ‘El imperio contraataca’. La resistencia inicial del maestro al entrenamiento, su carácter cascarrabias, e incluso el propio emplazamiento, con pequeños homenajes más o menos conscientes, como ese Ala-X de Luke bajo el agua, que aquí indicaría la decisión del piloto de quedar aislado para siempre del resto del mundo. Ahora él es el Yoda y Rey es él.  Johnson parece no pretender evitar que la situación siga al modelo. Rey decide interrumpir la formación para tratar de recuperar a Kylo Ren, convencida de que aún hay bien en él. Sí, exactamente lo mismo que Luke hizo por su padre en ‘El retorno del Jedi’. Aunque en ‘El imperio contraataca’ primero se iba para ayudar a sus amigos, aquí se toma el atajo hasta el ‘Episodio VI’ y tenemos una rendición total de Rey a Ren. En tierra se queda Luke, charlando con el fantasma de Yoda sobre el destino del pupilo, tal y como hacía Yoda con el fantasma de Obi-Wan, discutiendo detalles sobre si es el último Jedi o no.  Todo esto lleva a una representación, en clave de arte moderno, de la escena en la que se desarrollaba el intenso triángulo de Luke, Darth Vader y el emperador Palpatine. Un momento que transcurre de forma más o menos similar pero ahora con Rey, Kilo Ren y Snoke: unos rayos azules de castigo, un tormento del padawan con imágenes de los rebeldes sufriendo incontables bajas en el espacio, y la rebelión del discípulo del lado oscuro a su maestro, solo que esta vez, después de liberar al héroe, el villano no se redime sino que se queda con el puesto de emperador. Pero ah, no sin antes extender la mano a Rey y proponerle gobernar la galaxia como padre e hi... digamos como ¿amantes? A estos calcos hay que sumarle pequeños momentos de resampleo menos evidente, como el esa deserción de Finn, similar al de Han Solo en la primera película. Hacerse pasar por soldados del imperio para desactivar un rayo tractor, igual que en el ‘Episodio IV’, y si ya nos vamos más cerca, de la propia ‘Rogue One’. El truco sigue funcionando, pero, oigan, igual en dos películas, dos años seguidos, ya canta. Por si acaso también está la traición del personaje de Benicio del Toro en el momento culminante, lo que explicaría que no aparezca Lando Calrisian por ninguna parte. Y, a falta de Han Solo, bueno es tener una nueva aparición en último momento del Halcón milenario para lanzar unos cuantos tiros a los malos con un ¡yuhu! ¿Qué malos? Unos cuantos AT-AT acercándose a una base rebelde, similar a la del planeta Hoth, que en vez de nieve tiene sal. Uno de esos momentos en los que alguien en la sala de guionistas propone “El principio de ‘El imperio contraataca’ se coloca al final, y así nadie se dará cuenta”. Una secuencia, por otra parte, increíblemente preciosa a nivel visual, con su suelo cada vez más rojo, de la misma manera que la mansión de ‘La cumbre escarlata' (Crimsom Peak, 2015) del otro del Toro. Como fuerza creativa, Johnson se postula como el renovador de la saga, pero aunque hayamos visto que no es tan rompedora con lo antiguo, sí que parece querer mostrarse bastante opuesta a la apertura de Abrams. Puesto que mucho de lo que construía aquella, aquí parece ser derribado para volver a empezar de nuevo. Si Rey encontraba el sable de Luke, aquí acaba destrozado en dos. La religión Jedi acaba en llamas. No hay mucha reverencia al acabar con iconos antiguos como el Admirante Ackbar.  C3-PO y R2-D2 son poco más que cameos, incluso  Chewbacca es uno alargado, solo se hace un pequeño guiño a su tristeza porla muerte de su compañero de aventuras durante años. Sin embargo, es más amable con apariciones como Maz Kanata vía holograma, para proveer de una información que, por otra parte, podría haber dado Poe Dameron él mismo. Un personaje, por cierto, al que se le da cierto arco como aspirante a líder enfrentado a Holdo, comenzando un motín interno que, una vez se despierta Leia, se demuestra inútil. Huir de las antiguas ideas, como intención, se enfrenta al hecho de que hacen falta nuevos aportes lo suficientemente potentes para sustituirlas. Hay muchas de las cosas que hacía bien el anterior episodio que no han tenido continuidad. Por ejemplo, los intereses amorosos, que estaban llevados al mínimo, se trasforman en un romance descuidado, de última hora, como si a los ejecutivos del estudio se les hubiera ocurrido meter el detalle a presión, quedando doblemente extraño con un beso un poco fuera de lugar.  Uno de los momentos más dudosos y forzados es el enfrentamiento de Finn contra Phasma, una némesis que nunca acaba de desarrollarse desde el ligero apunte de ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ pero que aparece aquí como un momento cumbre. En ausencia de un sable laser, Finn toma un arma con resplandor azul para luchar con su “maestra”, cuyo final es un poco tópico, caída cual coyote de Tex Avery, en medio de una orgía de fuego que se percibe como concesión al blockbuster rutinario. Hay otros detalles un poco parodiables. Como ese estilismo de Snoke, que quizá intenta compensar su fealdad con un batín de Hugh Hefner y, sobre todo, ese comentado vuelo del espacio de Leia a lo  Mary Poppins. Seguro que está lleno de buena intención, y no es malo recordar que, al fin y al cabo, suponemos que Organa/Skywalker es una Jedi, o debería serlo tras las promesas de la trilogía original, pero la ejecución del momento está lejos de convertirse en un testamento estelar para la desaparecida Carrie Fisher. Toda la universalidad de conceptos que tenía el anterior ciclo, como el héroe homérico, el descubrimiento artúrico, son completadas por referencias religiosas más expresas, obvias en su segunda lectura. Tenemos el sacrificio de Abraham por aquí y algunas cruces puestas intencionadamente por allá, pero en su desmitificación a dos bandas pierde algo del poder de comunicación atemporal que hace que ‘Star Wars’ llegue a distintas generaciones. ‘Los últimos Jedi’ patina es en sus, por suerte no abundantes, intentos de ser relevante e incluir un discurso que hable sobre la actualidad. Si lo mejor de la trilogía de precuelas era el arriesgado, (y nada habitual en el cine fantástico), movimiento de Lucas por exponer que los caudillos aparecen siempre detrás de sonrisas durante un paciente desarrollo de tres películas, aquí Johnson prefiere, de nuevo, colocar el mensaje en boca de los protagonistas.  La charla sobre la resistencia de la vicealmirante Holdo tiene ciertas implicaciones subersivas con el terrorismo, pero el pueril y trasnochado alegato animalista —es la mejor película de la saga contra las carreras de caballos— está metido con destornillador. La pormenorizada explicación sobre los especuladores de la guerra, traficantes de armas y corporaciones explotadoras no tiene más relevancia en la trama que tratar de actualizar el rostro del mal, apuntando al neoliberalismo global. Lo cual, todo sea dicho, no deja de tener su gracia que venga desde el estudio Disney, que espera recaudar dos mil millones de dólares con la película para sumar a los tres mil de las dos anteriores. Su discurso rupturista es refrescante, pero se echa en falta alguna idea sobre las razones del ascenso de Snoke y la primera orden, algo ausente en ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ que es de nuevo ignorado, sin dar apuntes que expliquen cómo el Imperio, aparentemente derrotado por la muerte del Emperador Palpatine y la destrucción de la Estrella de la Muerte logró reformarse hasta este punto, aunque lo importante es que nos deja la puerta abierta a otra clase distinta de imperio y también de alianza rebelde. Lo cierto es que, gracias a la rotunda dirección, su extasiante belleza plástica, y su capacidad de crear momentos de intensidad épica, 'Los últimos Jedi' se sobrepone a los baches y se alza como una enorme aportación al legado de la saga. Quizá no es el capítulo que esperábamos, con un guion con tendencia al trazo grueso y poco elegante al transmitir su tema, pero está totalmente a la altura de las circunstancias, y aunque se haga el duro, aún cree y nos hace creer en la magia."
"Jul 21, 2019",POSITIVE," When Star Wars: The Force Awakens debuted exactly two years ago, its detractors groused that it was a timid and lazy movie insofar as it never deviated much from the template established by the original Star Wars back in 1977. I would counter that this isn’t exactly true – while it did borrow plenty of plot points from George Lucas’ first baby, it did so in imaginative and exciting ways – but never mind. Star Wars: The Last Jedi likely won’t be dismissed with similar charges, even if one sizable chunk feels like a rehash of The Empire Strikes Back. Written and directed by Rian Johnson, The Last Jedi is very much its own entity, exploring new routes as it teases out themes that have always been present in the Skywalker saga. It’s a bold and challenging work — exactly what we would expect from the auteur of Brick and Looper. In the debit column, it’s also a tad bloated, and it contains an almost risible number of false endings — admittedly not as many as the 42 or so that closed The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, but enough to draw attention. The last thing anyone would want in a review of a new Star Wars movie is spoilers, so let’s tread carefully, shall we? As we saw at the end of The Force Awakens, new Jedi on the block Rey (Daisy Ridley) has finally made contact with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who’s been hiding out on an island populated by Porgs (this movie’s equivalent of those infernal Ewoks, though thankfully employed only sparingly). Meanwhile, in another part of the galaxy, General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) is doing her best to keep the Resistance from being crushed by the First Order. In other story strands, the bravery exhibited by Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is weighed against his recklessness; Finn (John Boyega) finds a new friend in maintenance worker Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran); and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) continues to fret and fume and throw tantrums with the best of them. Actually, the character arc given to Kylo Ren is an excellent one, marking him as one of this entry’s most intriguing players. Yet the greatest appeal is in watching Hamill and Fisher again explore and expand upon their iconic roles. Fisher delivers a commanding performance in both senses of the word, and knowing that her tragic death means this will be her final appearance further lends the proceedings a somber and bittersweet tone. As for Hamill, this might represent his finest work in the 40-year-old franchise. Johnson allows the character of Luke Skywalker to evolve in some startling and unexpected ways, and Hamill is with him every step of the way, contributing a turn that’s weighty and wonderful. At 152 minutes, The Last Jedi is the longest of the nine Star Wars films to date — it’s also the only one where the length is felt (that riveting Trade Federation chat that opens The Phantom Menace, though…). While all the scenes involving younglings should have been deep-sixed, the rest of the fatty tissue can be forgiven, since it simply meant Johnson wanted to make sure fans were saturated and satisfied. Yet there aren’t many vignettes that couldn’t have benefited from a judicious trim here or there. Still, this is a minor quibble when placed against the magnitude of the movie. Between its acute attention to character growth, the excellent effects that serve rather than dominate, and the poignant moments that tie back to past entries (a particular scene that employs a snippet of vintage footage is nothing less than glorious), it’s easy to imagine true believers’ emotions hitting hyperdrive as they anticipate the concluding chapter that’s landing on December 20, 2019."
"Jul 17, 2019",POSITIVE," In the lead up to the Star Wars: The Force Awakens release two years ago, most excited fans ignored the studio’s chosen title for the film and just referred to it as “New Star Wars.” But it wasn’t. Not really. The Force Awakens was an artfully curated exercise in weaponized nostalgia designed to reintroduce a beloved mythology to brand new audiences. It mixed the old and the new well enough to function, but JJ Abrams was tasked with recontextualizing A New Hope more than he was with creating something brand new. Seeds were planted for the future, but revisiting the film now, it doesn’t hold the same power it did opening weekend. The Last Jedi actually is New Star Wars. With the groundwork laid to rest in the previous outing, Looper writer/director Rian Johnson is free to plot a new course, resulting in a film that is very recognizably “Star Wars” in tone and scope, but executed with more sound filmcraft than its predecessor. Since it’s Act Two of the new trilogy, some expected this new chapter to rhyme with Empire Strikes Back and hew darker in tone with a more down-note cliffhanger conclusion. But Johnson has created a Star Wars film that balances heavy stakes with light hearted frivolity, that couches disturbing revelations within refrains of hope. Whether it’s the best film in the canon is sure to be a tiresome debate but it’s easily the most exhilarating blockbuster experiences of the year. As everyone behind the film has gone to great lengths to protect the film’s plot details, a rundown of The Last Jedi’s narrative would be a disservice to anyone who wants to see the film blind. Episode VIII takes place not long after the closing moments of the last film, with Rey (Daisy Ridley) seeking out help from Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). General Leia (Carrie Fisher) and The Resistance want Luke back just as badly as Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and The First Order want him dead, so the mystery of why he’s gone full hermit drives much of the film’s story. The other two thirds of the new trilogy’s holy trinity, Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) each have their own thrilling B-plots that run parallel to Rey’s quest, but another major player, Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) emerges as a compelling lead equal to the others in emotional resonance, even if she receives less screen time than the conflicted Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Every single cast member avails themselves quite nicely, but it’s Tran who steals the show for the newer characters. She’s impossible not to fall for. As for the old guard, the realization that this is the last we’ll ever truly see of General Leia is disheartening, but Fisher is as great as she’s always been. However this trilogy ends up turning out, knowing the next film was intended to be her big showing (the way The Force Awakens was Han’s) will always be its greatest tragedy. This film’s core performance, though, must be Hamill’s. This man has waited years to get this shot and he knocks it out of the fucking park, delivering the best turn in his career and reinventing Luke as a man wrestling with his own legend. So much of the film is about burning down the past and forging ahead anew, and no one embodies that more than Luke. This being “Star Wars” and not “Intergalactic Conflict,” the battle between good and evil, right and wrong, has to be writ large, all encompassing, with everyone in the cosmos choosing a side. More than ever, this outing seems the most concerned with each individual character’s fluid alignment for and against the central cause of resistance. In the macro, one of the film’s weaknesses is its inability to clearly define its villains and the real power behind their motivations, but on a micro scale, all the film’s central figures are given recognizable arcs that tie together thematically. Johnson’s script, while on the bloated side (especially the latter half of the third act), is remarkably character driven, with the prime players and their decisions informing the direction of the story, rather than shoddy plotting and the necessity for regularly timed set pieces. But when there is an action sequence, and the film houses many, they’re immaculately arranged segments of cinema that make it clear why Johnson was the right man to helm this film. His prior work shows an artist with a shrewd appreciation for visual storytelling, so blowing up his style to the size of iMAX means his work retains its necessary clarity, resulting in one of the few big budget IP exercises that would function just as well stripped of its nostalgic brand recognition solely on the strength of its potent building blocks. It’s imperfect, yes, and there’s a few wrong notes throughout that will surely stick out across its two and a half hour run time, but this is a film that works. The writing, direction, cinematography, score, editing and performances are firing on all cylinders in concert. The Last Jedi runs like such a well oiled machine that its forgivable sputters and false starts stick out more than they might in a lesser film. Upon first watch, few will find much to dislike about this movie, and the realization that Abrams is returning for Episode IX will make most long for this trilogy to be over so Johnson can come back and kick start the next one. But after a week or two of think pieces and countless writers trying to ascribe the film’s aspirational statements about the nature of hope and the necessity of resistance to our depressing reality will ignite any backlash this crowd pleaser ends up receiving. The Last Jedi has quite a few potent moments, the kind of heart soaring peaks pop art popcorn flicks so rarely seem to achieve anymore. Within the nebulous, somewhat ill-defined world of “Star Wars” morality, these cinematic aphorisms have weight, but those wishing to pluck them wholesale from a galaxy far, far away and into the all too chilling world we actually live in will find them wanting. At its core, Johnson can only push the Disney machine so far. This is still a cash cow designed to sell merchandise. Anyone going in thinking someone has finally cracked the monoculture code and created One Film To Rule Them All will be disappointed. But for a damn good time at the movies, bolstered by a buoyant sense of hope for a darkened world, nothing else in 2017 will leave you feeling like there’s still a chance, even if life after the credits will do its damnedest to convince you otherwise."
"Jun 21, 2019",POSITIVE," *NOTE: The original headline read STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI Frustrates As Much As It Thrills.  Upon a second viewing, I felt it necessary to edit my review. I’ll admit, as a lifelong STAR WARS fan, a release of a new film always puts me on edge. I can admit when I’m wrong and THE LAST JEDI is a thrilling chapter in the STAR WARS saga. The second time around, most of the flaws held true, but overall the light side far outweighed the dark. My original review can be found unedited at the bottom of this article.  There’s a moment in THE LAST JEDI where the villainous Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) smashes his helmet in a fit of rage after being belittled by Supreme Leader Snoke for his costume. Ren’s get up was as much an ode to the character’s idol Darth Vader as it was a throwback to the original STAR WARS trilogy. The latest STAR WARS adventure seeks to “destroy the past”— a theme in the film—by attempting to avoid the critiques of 2017’s THE FORCE AWAKENS being simply a retread of the 1977 original. While JEDI certainly is not a riff on THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, it does feel like writer/director Rian Johnson culled sequences from EMPIRE, RETURN OF THE JEDI—and even takes a few cues from the maligned prequel trilogy—and rearranged them at random. If THE FORCE AWAKENS was the film to get older fans back in the saddle, THE LAST JEDI is made for the generation of STAR WARS fans that were introduced to the dysfunctional Skywalkers through Padme, Ani, and Qui Gon Jin. That said, there’s enough of those terrific, classic STAR WARS stylings—a dirty, lived in universe, frontier style landscapes, and a brisk sense of fun—to satisfy the old timers as well. Featuring slam-bang action, lots of quick and witty dialogue, and some terrifically memorable character moments. the more modern in style LAST JEDI is certainly overstuffed, at times exhausting and even unsatisfying, but remains a thrilling STAR WARS adventure. The film opens what feels like days or perhaps hours after the climax of THE FORCE AWAKENS with the Resistance on the run from the evil First Order. The opening space battle is thrilling and compellingly shot; director Rian Johnson gives the audience a real sense of space, never crowding the screen with too many ships and giving a real sense of urgency and emotion to the action as hotshot flyboy Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) takes on a dreadnaught Star Destroyer on his own. THE LAST JEDI then makes way into an extended chase sequence—owing a bit to MAD MAX: FURY ROAD—that extends through most of the film’s almost three hour run time. The film hits the ground running and keeps running. THE LAST JEDI feels like it’s rushing towards the finish line, never slowing down enough to give the characters a real chance to breathe and get to know one another, and by that allowing the audience to do the same. The runtime of the film leads to pacing issues; sometimes there can be too much of a good things, and sometimes Johnson doesn’t know what the good thing is. One of the most entertaining tropes of the series is when the characters get to explore fantastic new worlds. The heroes split up, with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) training Rey (Daisy Ridley) on the misty planet of Ahch-To, Dameron dealing with a power struggle with Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) while on the run from The First Order, and Finn (John Boyega) and newly introduced freedom fighter Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) on a mission to a casino on Canto Bight. Canto Bight—a sort of Monte Cristo meets French Riviera—is a stand out in THE LAST JEDI. The audience is introduced to the 1% of the STAR WARS universe: arms dealers decked out in evening wear and sipping on champagne, featuring inspired, classic sci-fi style costuming on its police force that recalls the old Marvel run of STAR WARS comic books and Ralph McQuarrie concept art. Unfortunately for as much as Johnson’s camera sweeps around the planet and the interior of the gambling parlor, the audience never really gets a chance to take in the surroundings, the film almost cutting away each time things really seem to be getting interesting. In the sequences between Rey and Luke, it feels like they barely get to know each other, much less have her trained to use the Force. There’s so much intercutting going on between the heroes and the villains that Kylo Ren—arguably the most interesting and complex character of the new films—gets the short shrift. Adam Driver mopes and mumbles throughout the film and really only gets to come alive in the third act when Ren becomes unhinged. While STAR WARS is best told in broad strokes, lending to the imagination of the audience, it helps to slow down and look around. As a result, the film feels disjointed.THE LAST JEDI is made for a different generation of film fan than the original series, its pacing having more in common with a Marvel superhero story, HARRY POTTER, or LORD OF THE RINGS (particularly with its multiple endings.). The telepathic conversations between Kylo Ren and Rey especially feel clunky, telling the audience big bits of exposition rather than showing. While a STAR WARS film—or any actioner—should indeed move quickly and keep the audience entertained, THE LAST JEDI feels more like a collection of moments—albeit genuinely exciting and visually impressive moments—rather than a complete story. While the plotting of the film may be half-baked, the characters come alive in THE LAST JEDI, propelling the film. John Boyega shines, as does Kelly Marie Tran. Together, they supply the film with that camaraderie one expects  and wants from a STAR WARS film. They join the lineage of great onscreen duos, from Han and Luke to Threepio and Artoo. There’s an easy-going, natural chemistry between the two actors that translates to the screen and the characters. There is even a hint of romance that was sorely missing from THE FORCE AWAKENS and spinoff film, ROGUE ONE. Tran brings a depth and coolness to her character that makes it impossible to take your eyes off her whenever she’s onscreen. Their storyline leads them to master hacker DJ played with genuine gusto by Benicio Del Toro. The villains remain the most interesting and complex characters of the new trilogy and it’s terrifically fun to watch Kylo Ren and General Hux (Domhall Gleeson) jockey for control of The First Order. While it’s wonderful to see Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill again, this film really does belong to the new characters, which is a double edged lightsaber. Older fans are going to leave wishing they spent more time with Luke and Leia, but this isn’t their story. This is a modernly directed STAR WARS tale for the next generation, and the film focuses on the new crew of heroes. There’s a brisk sense humor that flows through THE LAST JEDI. When the jokes hit, they hit hard like they came from the Lawrence Kasdan playbook (particularly Poe Dameron tooling with General Hux in the films opening) but some of the one liners—cribbing from the quippy style of Joss Whedon’s AVENGERS films and the Marvel Cinematic Universe—draw attention to themselves and cut down the soapy drama that has propelled the STAR WARS series since EMPIRE. There’s a particular crack from Daisy Ridley’s Rey about a shirtless Kylo Ren that while funny, really doesn’t have a place in the scene and in turn kills any dramatic tension.There’s also an abundance of slapstick that—while always a part of the series—seems to have more in common with Jar Jar Binks than Artoo and Threepio. Sometimes it plays, more often it doesn’t. Not everything needs to be gritty, but THE LAST JEDI could have benefited from leaning into some darker places. The film does tie up loose ends and attempts to give payoffs to the hanging threads not only from THE FORCE AWAKENS but Luke Skywalker’s personal journey from the original films. There does seem to be an attempt to squeeze the best elements of EMPIRE and RETURN OF THE JEDI into the film, the problem is, some of it feels unearned as they’re happening just too soon in the series. Ridley, Driver, and Andy Serkis’ as Snoke do command the screen when they’re together, bringing a real sense of pulpy drama to rehashed EMPIRE STRIKES BACK via RETURN OF THE JEDI bits. One of the best is the confrontation between Finn and Captain Phasma, having been expertly, and simply built upon from THE FORCE AWAKENS. The audience hasn’t spent enough time with these characters for the pay offs to carry any real weight and on the flipside, Luke Skywalker’s arc feels a touch unsatisfying, but at the same time perfectly fits in the theme of hope that has flowed through STAR WARS since 1977.  Hamill delivers a great performance, but his character feels lost in the shuffle. Hamill’s reunion with Artoo is a stand out in the film filled with so much emotion, despite the fact that he’s talking to what amounts to a prop. It’s a perfect blend of characterization and nostalgia for long time fans. THE LAST JEDI thrills far more than it frustrates. There’s so much good in the film: the set design and costuming are spot on from the beat up leather jackets, to the samurai influenced Praetorian guards, and an ultra cool Luke Skywalker in Jedi garb. There is a gangbusters lightsaber battle that—while not as rough and sweaty as this reviewer would have liked—is an all timer and the reveal of Rey’s lineage is smartly written by Johnson and wonderfully played by Driver and Ridley. John Williams’ score is arguably the real star of the film this time around,  expertly weaving new themes with the classics that have been rattling around in fans’ brains for forty years and Johnson pulls off some truly beautiful shots. Unfortunately, with a STAR WARS film being released what will probably be every year until we all become one with the Force, there will be more pretty ok ones than truly great ones. THE LAST JEDI sits somewhere in the middle as a very good entry in the STAR WARS series. Johnson takes some risks with the story—maybe not enough of them to truly make THE LAST JEDI a classic—and some of them pay off, and some of them fall flat, or feel like cheats. With J.J. Abrams coming back in the fold for the trilogy’s conclusion, perhaps his more traditional approach to filmmaking can provide a satisfying conclusion to this interesting new saga. There’s a moment in THE LAST JEDI where the villainous Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) smashes his helmet in a fit of rage after being belittled by Supreme Leader Snoke for his costume. Ren’s get up was as much an ode to the character’s idol Darth Vader as it was a throwback to the original STAR WARS trilogy. The latest STAR WARS adventure seeks to “destroy the past”— a theme in the film—by attempting to avoid the critiques of 2017’s THE FORCE AWAKENS being simply a retread of the 1977 original. While JEDI certainly is not a riff on THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, it does feel like writer/director Rian Johnson culled sequences from EMPIRE, RETURN OF THE JEDI—and even takes a few cues from the maligned prequel trilogy—and rearranged them at random. If THE FORCE AWAKENS was the film to get older fans back in the saddle, THE LAST JEDI is made for the generation of STAR WARS fans that were introduced to the dysfunctional Skywalkers through Padme, Ani, and Qui Gon Jin. While infinitely more enjoyable than the prequel trilogy featuring slam-bang action, witty dialogue, and some terrifically memorable character moments, the more modern in style LAST JEDI just misses the mark, feeling overstuffed and at the same time more hollow than audiences expect from STAR WARS. The film opens what feels like days or perhaps hours after the climax of THE FORCE AWAKENS with the Resistance on the run from the evil First Order. The opening space battle is thrilling and compellingly shot; director Rian Johnson gives the audience a real sense of space, never crowding the screen with too many ships and giving a real sense of urgency and emotion to the action as hotshot flyboy Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) takes on a dreadnaught Star Destroyer on his own. THE LAST JEDI then makes way into an extended chase sequence—owing a bit to MAD MAX: FURY ROAD—that extends through most of the film’s almost three hour run time. The film hits the ground running and keeps running. THE LAST JEDI feels like it’s rushing towards the finish line, never slowing down enough to give the characters a real chance to breathe and get to know one another, and by that allowing the audience to do the same. One of the most entertaining tropes of the series is when the characters get to explore fantastic new worlds. The heroes split up, with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) training Rey (Daisy Ridley) on the misty planet of Ahch-To, Dameron dealing with a power struggle with Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) while on the run from The First Order, and Finn (John Boyega) and newly introduced freedom fighter Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) on a mission to a casino on Canto Bight. Canto Bight—a sort of Monte Cristo meets French Riviera—is a stand out in THE LAST JEDI. The audience is introduced to the 1% of the STAR WARS universe: arms dealers decked out in evening wear and sipping on champagne, featuring inspired, classic sci-fi style costuming on its police force that recalls the old Marvel run of STAR WARS comic books and Ralph McQuarrie concept art. Unfortunately for as much as Johnson’s camera sweeps around the planet and the interior of the gambling parlor, the audience never really gets a chance to take in the surroundings, the film almost cutting away each time things really seem to be getting interesting.

"Jun 18, 2019",POSITIVE," 5 – I think it’s super-neato-cool that you have spent the last two years talking about how you didn’t like The Force Awakens—and, thus, aren’t looking forward to The Last Jedi—because you thought it “ripped off” A New Hope. Using that logic, computers ripped off typewriters and the internet totally bogarted the encyclopedia’s jam. Building off things while improving on them is apparently only unnatural to creationists and OG Star Wars fans. Going into any installment of any series primed to hate it only makes an ass out of “u” and me. Or something. Like the storied, legendary oracles En Vogue once said, “Free your mind, and the rest will follow.” 4 – The Last Jedi not only doesn’t care that we’ve spent the last two years agonizing over certain mysteries, backstories and destinies, it actively LOLs at us for doing so. The way Luke (Mark Hamill) reacts to Rey (Daisy Ridley) handing him his lightsaber is like a Rickroll from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far in your face. Writer/director Rian Johnson immediately establishes that he is the first director interested in using the most beloved franchise in film history to actually share a timely thematic message and say something. And what he says will shock you! You’ve got to see what’s number one below! Sorry, the impending loss of internet freedom after the FCC’s net neutrality vote has me feeling a little clickbaity. 3 – The Last Jedi’s first half is clunky. Finn (John Boyega) gets paired with Rose (Kelly Marie Tran)—a kindly Rebel grunt who is easily my favorite new character in this new trilogy—to get a code or something to shut something off or something… The character dynamics work, but that subplot substantively does not. Poe (Oscar Isaac) is paired with Leia (Carrie Fisher) in a subplot about the future of the resistance, while Luke and Rey invert expectations about Jedi training and the very nature of the Force. If George Lucas shat upon the sanctity of the Force with the prequels, Johnson scrubs it clean and holy again. It all culminates in a breathtaking finale that blows every Death Star kaboom out the damn water. 2 – Before we get to Johnson’s inspired, poignant message, let me say that Benecio del Toro needs to stop it. He needs to stop it right the hell now. Ever since The Usual Suspects, we have quietly enabled him to do goofy, dumb shit with his voice, pretending it was cool. It’s not cool, Benecio. It’s never been cool. You’re just bored, and it’s weird. I barely noticed the gaping plot hole your character created because you were so busy having tiny seizures or picking your teeth with your uvula or whatever that fake stuttering crap was you were doing. 1 – The Last Jedi simultaneously condemns the notion of importance by virtue of birthright and elevates the power and responsibility inherent in the masses. In the span of one film, Johnson has deemphasized the central conceit of the first seven Star Wars movies—that a powerful, chosen few are key to our collective future—and replaced it with an emphasis on the “specialness of the unspecial.” The best climax in a Star Wars movie is followed by one of my favorite endings to a blockbuster film ever, which underscores this theme with bold strokes. It’s almost impossible to rank a film in this series after having only seen it once, but this is closer to the top than it is the bottom. Except for Benecio del Toro. Serously, man, knock it off."
"Jun 8, 2019",NEUTRAL," Well, as writer/director Rian Johnson’s “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” unfolds, one might wonder if the Resistance needs a better marketing department, because – yet again – they are greatly outnumbered by the draconian, downright awful First Order.  The First Order, whose members sport pitch black threads and their faces wear scowls (coupled with occasional smirks), are simply not easy to like, but the Resistance - like the Rebel Alliance before it – is facing overwhelming odds against a superior military and legions of bad guys.   Maybe someone in the Resistance should form a promotions department or at least print up some fliers, because they seem to be missing an opportunity to recruit new freedom fighters. Johnson must have recruited a talented film crew, because his movie looks absolutely stunning.  Mixed with some new mechanized ships, weapons and contraptions and along with some fearsome, familiar ones, the battles on land and space spectacularly strike the right science fiction, escapist tones that both children and adults pine for during a Star Wars picture.  The film offers about a half-dozen take-your-breath-away moments and credit Johnson for thoughtfully constructing these particular sequences that will steal a collective bit of oxygen from the lungs of theatre audiences.  On the other hand, the sluggish and very mechanical main plot thread, the surprisingly undeveloped relationships between key characters and a few head-scratching choices (which I will not reveal) construct a questionable foundation that the aforementioned visuals and assorted heart-stopping minutes cannot conceal. Meanwhile, The First Order – led by General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) - is in relentless pursuit of Leia, Poe (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and rest of the Resistance, who continue to experience their numbers problem.  With a highly intriguing mix of old characters and relatively new ones (Rey, Poe, Finn, Hux, Kylo Ren, and more) and brand spanking new ones – played by Laura Dern, Kelly Marie Tran and Benicio Del Toro – Johnson holds the ingredients for a complex, character-driven story to match his visual storytelling.  Sadly, that never materializes, as he appears content to highlight long stretches of uneventful exposition instead.  With Rey and Luke, Johnson’s script offers some scarce table scraps of new facts, and - like two people staring at their individual cell phones during a nice meal on a Saturday night - their time feels completely wasted on the island.  Admittedly, Rey and Kylo Ren’s verbal duels do raise a new hope (pardon the pun) for a warm détente and also a fear for a dark turn.  I will not reveal the results of their particular encounters, but – stylistically - their engagements play in the same ballpark as the artless, highly criticized exchanges between Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and Padme (Natalie Portman) in “Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones” (2002).  Although, they are not quite that bad. Outside of some long-winded talk, the picture contains three extensive physical clashes between the baddies and the good guys, but the biggest conflict in the movie is finding enough screen time for the very worthy characters.  Except for the opening 15 minutes, Poe is really given nothing substantive to do.  For Laura Dern’s character (who I will not name or describe), Johnson presents no backstory or establishing scenes, so her few on-screen moments do not generate enough gravitas.  Somehow, Chewbacca must have learned magic in his spare time, because he pulls off a tremendous on-screen disappearing trick.  He is barely in the picture.  In fact, when he suddenly reappears in the third act, this particular critic actually forgot that he was starring in movie, as the screenplay treats him like a bit, sideshow player, like some of the new Star Wars creatures:  the Porgs who look like cute little penguins and a pack of albino wolves who may have accidentally stepped into a glitter factory. Finn and a resistance fighter named Rose (Tran) do chew up lots of movie minutes on a special mission, but their tangential side project feels recycled, as just a vehicle to show off a new planet. All of this and more fill a very long 2 hours and 32 minutes but with only a fraction of the swashbuckling fun of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens”.  Sure, the 2015 picture might be a fraternal twin to “Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope” (1977), but it recaptured that magic, those goosebumps that a great Star Wars film can give.  Despite meticulous efforts, mammoth productions, striking locales, some enjoyable fan-friendly moments, and about six explosive swathes of celluloid, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” is missing that goosebumps-factor.  The 152-minute picture felt familiar and not nostalgic, but repetitive within its own narrative.  It is not the worst film in the series, but perhaps the biggest waste in terms of advancing the 9-part storyline.  Of course, casual and diehard Star Wars fans should see this film, and many, many audiences will hopefully and probably walk out of theatres with big smiles, because it is a rare treat to experience a brand new movie from this iconic franchise.  Unfortunately, this particular critic walked away with a lengthy list of the film’s missed opportunities while also wanting to help jumpstart the Resistance’s nonexistent recruiting campaign.  Jeff – a member of the Phoenix Critics Circle – has penned film reviews since 2008 and graduated from ASU’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism.  Follow Jeff and the Phoenix Film Festival on Twitter @MitchFilmCritic and @PhoenixFilmFest, respectively.

"Jun 4, 2019",POSITIVE,"A world where women can be strong without the help of men, where princesses can become generals, and girls who come from nothing on a backwater planet can rise to become the hope of the galaxy."
"May 16, 2019",POSITIVE," NOTE: This review is SPOILER-FREE. However, to talk about the movie we do need to talk about the plot, even if it is the vaguest terms. So if you're someone who wants to go in knowing absolutely nothing, the first line is a short ""thesis"" for the review, then the small amount of story details are after the director and summary. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the best kind of entry into a franchise that takes unexpected risks, keeps you on the edge of your seat, and is emotionally moving in a way that will be leave fans stunned. Director: Rian Johnson
Summary: Having taken her first steps into the Jedi world, Rey joins Luke Skywalker on an adventure with Leia, Finn, and Poe that unlocks mysteries of the Force and secrets of the past. In one of the many trailers for Star Wars: The Last Jedi, we hear Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) say, ""This is not going to go the way you think."" That is a pretty fair description of the experience of watching The Last Jedi. Fans who think they know what to expect from this movie are going to be have those expectations blown right out of the water when they get into The Last Jedi. Our story follows three basic plot lines: Rey (Daisy Ridley) tries to convince Luke to return to the Resistance because they need his help. Finn (John Boyega) is joined by newcomer Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) to try to save the Resistance from impending doom. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is still struggling with the conflict within himself from killing his father in The Force Awakens. There is obviously more to all of it than that, but this is spoiler-free, and going in with as little knowledge as possible makes for an optimal viewing experience. There has been some worry among fans that Lucasfilm wasn't giving their directors and writers any room to create their own movies. While many agreed that The Force Awakens was good, it did feel very similar to A New Hope. The Last Jedi is nothing like Empire Strikes Back, and in fact feels very much like Rogue One in that it's extremely different. It takes risks from the first moment and opens up new doors in what the mythology of this world really is. This is a character piece, and the moments of building are subtle and lovely to watch. We see our main heroes each go through new trials and tribulations that help shape the people they will become in future movies — in both good ways and bad. Director/writer Rian Johnson doesn't just take risks; he does things with this movie that could easily be considered ""unsafe"" for brand management, and no one at Lucasfilm seems to take issue with it. There is a reason they gave this man his own corner of the Star Wars universe. The cast continues to be the best part of this entire franchise. Any moment Carrie Fisher is on screen is just a reminder of what a wonderful actress and person we lost. It makes every one of her scenes that much more moving and heartbreaking. Hamill shows us a new side to Luke Skywalker and proves that he can take this character in new and believable directions. Ridley is a powerhouse in the role of Rey as we watch this young woman struggle to find her place in this world. Boyega and Tran are a great duo. Their story is fun and engaging to watch, with Tran clearly becoming the new heart of the series. Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron grows in beautifully subtle ways and continues to steal every single scene he's in. Newcomers Laura Dern and Benicio del Toro don't have a ton of screen time, but Dern in particular is handed one of the best scenes in the movie. Driver and Domhnall Gleeson as General Hux continue to play wonderfully off of each other to the point where you want to ask them to lay their lightsabers on the table and get out a ruler to clear everything up. It's not an entirely perfect movie, to be fair. There is a bit of clunky dialogue at times, and the structure is a little weird when you think about it too much. It's also a long movie and there are times when it feels that way, which is usually indicative of a pacing issue. These are nitpicks, though, and hardly dealbreakers when it comes to the final product. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an emotional roller coaster of a movie. It fakes you out with what you think is going to happen, and then completely flips that on its head. It expands the scope of what we think is capable from the Force in this universe. It sets up a new dynamic that is going to prove fascinating to watch in future movies. ""This is not going to go the way you think,"" is the best possible way to describe this gift of a film."
"May 9, 2019",POSITIVE,"Let's not mince words: This will be remembered as one of the best science fiction/fantasy movies of all time, and this backlash simply must stop, because that's no way to treat a near-masterpiece."
"May 8, 2019",POSITIVE,"Unnecessary the longest Star Wars film to date, but has some of the most epic ground-breaking moments in the franchise."
"Apr 28, 2019",NEGATIVE,A lot of the films ideas I like in theory but it was not executed well. The more I thought about it the less I liked it
"Apr 25, 2019",POSITIVE,[Rian Johnson] succeeded on a lot of levels; I feel like there were a lot of other levels that didn't work as much.
"Apr 16, 2019",POSITIVE," ""The Force Awakens"" brought a new generation of lovable characters together. ""The Last Jedi"" breaks them apart. The result is the richest, most epic, most emotional Star Wars movie so far.  General Leia's rebel forces flee the enemy's military might. A side mission to a shady city brings intrigue and betrayal. And a powerful student learns the ways of the Force from an aging Jedi master.  At the heart of the film is the plotline following troubled apprentice Rey as she joins Luke Skywalker to dive into what it means to be a Jedi. It's a joy to watch Mark Hamill's and Daisy Ridley's characters wrestle with the true nature of the Force and the moral and spiritual questions at the heart of the Star Wars phenomenon. Then, when this compelling strand intertwines with Adam Driver's tortured villain, Kylo Ren, ""Last Jedi"" reaches levels of intensity never previously seen in the entire 
  Star Wars
 saga. A key revelation halfway through turns everything you think you know about Luke upside down, fueling a soul-stirring climax. Except that isn't even the end, as the film slips into an even higher gear for an epic final crescendo, alternating gut-punching emotional beats with air-punching action set pieces. It's glorious to behold.  Fans might spot one wrinkle, however. It's understandable that this second film in the new trilogy might be influenced by ""The Empire Strikes Back"", the second film in the classic Star Wars series and the movie widely considered to be the best in the saga -- if not a contender for best sequel ever. But it isn't far into ""The Last Jedi"" that you begin to see parallels and even individual details copied and pasted from ""The Empire Strikes Back"".  Rose, an upstanding rebel mechanic played by Kelly Marie Tran, is a delight to watch. She embodies the indomitable moral spirit of Star Wars with her clear-eyed determination to do the right thing and amusingly sparks off John Boyega's Finn.  Another storyline, in which dashing pilot Poe Dameron attempts to protect the rebel fleet, is also undercooked. Manufactured conflict can't disguise the fact that Poe, played by Oscar Isaac, doesn't have much to do but spin his wheels and yap at his superiors. Luckily, those superiors are General Leia and Admiral Holdo, played by Carrie Fisher and Laura Dern, who could teach master classes in cool, commanding authority.  Truly funny moments balance the intense, emotional ones. General Hux, played by Domhnall Gleeson, is the butt of most of the gags, but Luke Skywalker also brings tragic-comic laughs. BB-8 is a one-droid hilarity machine, and only the hardest heart could resist the penguin-like porgs, which thankfully are more tribble than Ewok. "

"Mar 26, 2019",POSITIVE," Letras amarillas sobre un fondo estrellado, piel de gallina, espectadores impacientes y cosplays incómodos. Ir a ver una película de Star Wars al cine no es, simplemente, ir al cine. Como generación, tenemos el privilegio único de ir al cine a ver una película nueva de Star Wars todos los años. Y esa es una de las maravillas de la era nostálgica que estamos viviendo. Por eso, la sensación que me deja Star Wars: The Last Jedi es extraña. No salí del cine conmovido ni emocionado; más bien pensaba, una y otra vez en la peculiar experiencia que fue ver esta película. Ésta no es una cinta efectiva que derrite corazones como The Force Awakens, no es una reinvención realista como Rogue One, no es un bodrio espantoso como Attack of the Clones y no es una clásica secuela como Empire Strikes Back. Es todo eso y nada de eso, es la película más arriesgada de Star Wars y una apuesta valiente que funciona con efectividad desigual. The Last Jedi merece el hype que se ha ganado por ser una reinvención osada del mito de Star Wars. Con esto, no es la mejor película de la saga, ni de cerca, pero se gana un lugar único en el universo de nuestros cariños galácticos. Éste es el principio del fin, la culminación de una saga familiar, el término de treinta años de espera. Después de la cinta de Rian Johnson, queda un universo renovado en espera de nuevas épicas. A diferencia de muchas otras cintas de Star Wars, The Last Jedi empieza casi inmediatamente después de su antecesora: los rebeldes están atrapados en la base de D’Qar acosados por la Primera Orden, Rey está llegando al final de su peregrinaje para encontrarse con Luke, y Finn se recupera de las heridas de la batalla en la Starkiller Base. A partir de ahí, la trama se construye en estas tres líneas narrativas: la de la guerra, protagonizada por Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) y la Vicealmirante Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern); la del aprendizaje en la Fuerza con Rey (Daisy Ridley) y Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill); y la de Finn (John Boyenga) con su nueva sidekick Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) en una misión para infiltrarse en la nave del Líder Supremo Snoke (Andy Serkis) ayudados por un ladrón de dudosa moral (Benicio del Toro). Paralelamente, se sigue desarrollando la eterna lucha por el cariño paterno de Snoke entre el General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) y el aprendiz Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). De ahí, The Last Jedi se construye como una clásica película de Star Wars con la típica edición entrelazada. Y toda la anécdota se fundamenta, básicamente, en una persecución: lo que queda de los rebeldes, después de la destrucción de la República, escapa de la Primera Orden y sus mortíferas armas esperando el regreso de Skywalker para liberarlos. The Last Jedi no es una película fundacional sino de conclusiones, no es una película de contexto sino de particularidades, no es una cinta de instituciones sino de individuos. The Last Jedi no es una película fundacional sino de conclusiones, no es una película de contexto sino de particularidades, no es una cinta de instituciones sino de individuos. En esta cinta no hay grandes viajes en la galaxia, no hay exploración de distintos mundos y sistemas, no hay una macro escena política. Todo se reduce al drama íntimo de la última persecución de los rebeldes y la última esperanza de una república herida de muerte. Aquí no hay Senado ni diplomacia, no hay instituciones y la jerarquía totalitaria de la Primera Orden es, junto a los estatutos militares de los rebeldes, el único orden que se vislumbra. Así, esta cinta no crea una densidad de universo sino que se vuelca completamente hacia el drama pequeño de sus personajes. No es una película fundacional sino de conclusiones, no es una película de contexto sino de particularidades, no es una cinta de instituciones sino de individuos. A diferencia de otras entregas de la saga, nada en esta cinta sale como uno espera. Porque, a pesar de lo sencilla que es la trama, Rian Johnson optó por integrar cosas absolutamente innovadoras… incluso, se podría decir, heréticas, en la mitología galáctica. The Force Awakens fue, evidentemente, un homenaje a la primera cinta de Star Wars. Con un argumento prácticamente calcado de la cinta de Lucas, Abrams quiso complacer a los viejos fanáticos de la saga al mismo tiempo que volvía familiares los temas para neófitos de estas regiones espaciales. El resultado fue emotivo y conmovedor… pero también gastó la fórmula. Si el Episodio VIII hubiera sido una calca de Empires Strikes Back, viejos y nuevos fanáticos hubieran abandonado el cariño a la saga. El predicamento de Rian Johnson era seguir los pasos de Abrams sin repetir su fórmula. Y lo logró con creces: esta cinta es una de las más arriesgadas y ambiciosas concepciones de Star Wars y su vieja mitología. Además, como un gesto de máximo respeto, Johnson utiliza marionetas tipo Jim Henson y animatrónicos para dar vida a las numerosas criaturas de este universo: desde Porgs hasta unas extrañas monjas protectoras del legado Jedi. Si esta cinta no explora a fondo el universo, sí juega constantemente con un trasfondo de vida animal y antropomorfa de una riqueza enorme (salvo por el Leprechaun). Pero la más fuerte influencia de esta cinta no mira hacia el pasado sino que se dirige hacia el futuro de la saga: se trata de Rogue One. Y, si la influencia de Rogue One no fuera evidente, podemos ver en un cameo a su director, Gareth Edwards, en una lucha de trinchera rebelde. Aquí la guerra se construye como una lucha estratégica paciente, se convierte en algo mucho más crudo y real, los aspectos más maniqueos se diluyen en tonalidades de gris. Aquí la guerra se construye como una lucha estratégica paciente, se convierte en algo mucho más crudo y real, los aspectos más maniqueos se diluyen en tonalidades de gris. Así, la influencia de Edwards está presente en toda la cinta: aquí la guerra se construye como una lucha estratégica paciente, se convierte en algo mucho más crudo y real, los aspectos más maniqueos se diluyen en tonalidades de gris. Hay que recordar que Rogue One fue la primera película que retrató a los rebeldes haciendo crímenes de guerra, asesinando por la espalda y a distancia, robando y destruyendo. Fue la primera cinta de Star Wars en salirse de la dicotomía entre la luz y la oscuridad. Basándose en los esfuerzos de Edwards, la cinta de Johnson quiere mostrar también otro aspecto de la eterna guerra: el del negocio que representa para los privilegiados que comercian con la guerra y la muerte. En esta cinta en donde prácticamente no hay política (como sí la hay –y mucha– en la segunda trilogía), la única mención a la forma de organización del régimen es sobre aquellos que están encima de toda política y de toda ideología. Los vendedores de armas como los cínicos de este universo que se olvidan de las luchas trascendentales para hacer un muy pragmático negocio. En este sentido, Johnson quiso empezar a desmitificar toda la construcción de Star Wars como un universo maniqueo en donde sólo importa la lucha trascendente de la luz contra la oscuridad. Esta cinta quiere reformar el universo de Star Wars con otros tonos, con otros conflictos, con nuevas ideas para nuevas generaciones. Con esto se ve que Johnson, como Luke queriendo renegar de la orden Jedi, quiere olvidar las pasadas obsesiones de la mitología de Star Wars. Por eso se permite explorar libremente, también, las posibilidades de la fuerza mostrando poderes que nunca antes se habían visto (y que seguro causarán más de una polémica entre los fanáticos más radicales). Todo esto muestra, dentro del concepto cíclico de la historia (con “h” mayúscula y minúscula) en esta saga, que la repetición se está diluyendo para dar paso a nuevas posibilidades. El fuerte verdadero de The Last Jedi está en la rebeldía que muestra, la originalidad que busca y la valentía que tiene al jugar con los conceptos más fetichizados de esta pesada mitología. Pero Johnson no siempre sale avante con esta apuesta. Esta es una cinta que quiere ser mucho con muy poco; es una trama sencilla que trata de incluir el fin de la saga familiar de los Skywalker y la renovación de un universo. Al final, The Last Jedi, para citar a Bilbo, se siente como poca mantequilla untada sobre demasiado pan. En las dos horas y media de cinta, Jonhson no muestra la misma maestría de Abrams que, como buen alumno de Spielberg, es un experto en mantener tono y coherencia. Aquí, la historia de Finn puede sentirse, por momentos, como algo accesorio que no aporta gran cosa a la trama y vuelve más pesada una de las cintas más largas de la saga. En otro sentido, el humor ligero de la cinta puede destantear a algunos que están acostumbrados a la solemnidad habitual de Star Wars o al humor más ácido de Han Solo (snif). Porque esta cinta trata de aligerar considerablemente el tono oscuro de otras entregas (Rogue One, por ejemplo) con constantes alivios cómicos con los personajes principales (y no nada más los androides en su rol tradicional.) Todas estas deficiencias, sin embargo, puede relacionarse con el mismo espíritu de cambio que comentamos. Porque las rupturas narrativas y de tono son parte de una necesidad de renovación: si The Force Awakens es una película nostálgica sobre el pasado, The Last Jedi es una cinta sobre la destrucción de un legado histórico. Luke y Leia tienen apariciones absolutamente memorables pero es la nueva relación entre Rey y Ben Solo la que se lleva la cinta. En la construcción entrelazada de sus identidades en proceso de formación vemos que el balance de la Fuerza no es algo que se logra, que se busca, o que se encuentra en alguien; sino una necesidad misma de la naturaleza. La Fuerza tiende al balance y esa explicación central en la película (que es de una belleza impresionante) tendrá repercusiones en el resto de la saga. The Last Jedi concluye la saga Skywalker, concluye el mito de los Jedi, asume el pasado legendario y fertiliza la tierra para nuevas creaciones. Si The Force Awakens me parece mejor película, The Last Jedi es esencial en una nueva coyuntura. Johnson pasará a la historia como el hereje que acabó con los viejos mitos para aligerar el pesado fardo del pasado y darle, a una nueva generación, su propia guerra de las galaxias. Elenco: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Lupita Nyong’o, Domhnall Gleeson, Kelly Marie Tran, Laura Dern, Benicio del Toro."
"Mar 2, 2019",POSITIVE," I have to admit that my life has been so hectic lately I haven’t really had time to anticipate any films this holiday season like I normally do. But when the press screening invite came out for The Last Jedi, I actually got more excited despite only having seen only one trailer. Well, I’m glad that is the only trailer/videos I’ve seen of the film… it’s best to see it ‘blind’ knowing as little as possible. I don’t write reviews very often anymore, so indulge me when I go a bit longer with this one. Force Awakens is more nostalgic and an homage to the original from JJ Abrams, and while The Last Jedi also still has to tread on familiar grounds, it somehow feels fresh and new. There are quite a few surprises that thrills, delights and tugs my heartstrings. Ok granted I’m more of a casual Star Wars fan, so I don’t have the depth knowledge like ardent aficionados, but I was quite caught up with the journey of the main characters. The story pretty much picks up where the last film leaves off, with a literal cliffhanger as we saw Rey (Daisy Ridley) meeting Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) up high on a cliff by an ocean. 
But before we get there, the film drops us straight into an intergalactic space battle of the Resistance fighters, led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) against the reigning First Order. I enjoy thrilling aerial battles and the SFX is off the charts in a film of this magnitude, but I’m glad there’s more to this movie than just action, action, action. What I really enjoyed most from the film is the quieter, more talky scenes between Rey and Luke. Writer/director Rian Johnson delved deep into the saga’s mythology and Jedi philosophy… about what the force really is, the real power of the Jedi, etc. Those are the real appeal of this enduring franchise and what makes me go ‘ok I see why people love this saga so much and why it appeals to multiple generations.’ There are fans who might not like the direction of Luke in this film (even Hamill himself reportedly told Johnson he fundamentally disagreed how his character was written), but I personally love the deconstruction of such a titular character. Why is Luke such a legend? Just what exactly is the Force and who gets to have it? How does Luke himself sees his own power and its effect in the universe? It’s always intriguing to learn just what the fuss is about Luke, especially given how he was talked about in virtually every scene in The Force Awakens, yet we only got to see him for mere seconds! I love the grizzled, curmudgeon Luke (like Hamill was channeling the real Harrison Ford!), the salt & pepper longish hair and beard makes him look even more distinguished. The scenes between him and Rey are definitely my favorite. “This is not going to go the way you think.” Luke says at one point (it’s not a spoiler as it’s in the trailer and all over its promos)… and you know what, the film actually delivers on that sentiment! The film is divided into three major scenarios, in which each team has to fulfill a certain ‘task’ if you will, all happening around the same time. My main quibble with the movie is that the transition between one scenario to another feels disjointed at times. One scene would be solemn and intense, then it’ll switch to something more mischievous and funky and then it’s full-throttle action. Perhaps it’s to be expected when you have such a vast narrative involving so many players but it could’ve been done more smoothly. That said though, the film has enough going for it–the energetic action, lively humor and genuine emotion–that I didn’t even mind the 2.5 hours running time. Obviously the strength of this space saga is the characters people truly care about over the years. I feel like there’s a proper balance (a word thrown out a lot in this film) between the iconic characters and the newer ones that expand the story. The emotional tug of war between Rey and Kylo is the heart of the story here, and both Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley are absolutely terrific. I’ve loved Ridley’s spunky Rey from the start and I find Driver’s Kylo even more magnetic here (and not only ’cause he’s got such great mane!). Yes he’s a grandpa Vader wanna-be (and he’s still got serious anger-management issues), but there’s much more than that and the internal conflict within him is palpable. Poor Domhnall Gleeson though, a terrific actor who’s relegated to being the comic relief as the over-the-top General Hux. On the Resistance team, pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac, not to be outdone by Adam in the sexy hair department) gets more to do here. I wouldn’t mind seeing a Poe solo movie with the oh-so-charismatic Isaac, he’s just a cool guy with a reckless energy a la Han Solo. There’s less bantering between him and his bestie Fin (John Boyega). Instead, Fin is paired with another spunky maintenance worker loyal to the Resistance, Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran). BB-8 is still an immensely fun droid to watch, while the new avian creature Porg likely only appeals to little kiddies. I’m glad to see two new female characters with a proper arc, one is Rose and the other is Vice Admiral Holdo, played by veteran actress Laura Dern. There’s a pretty intense exchange between her and Poe, but I’m not even going to spoil it for you what it’s about. One thing I can say is the scenes of Carrie Fisher is truly bittersweet. The film is dedicated to her (naturally!) but the whole film gives a proper homage to such an iconic character. It was cool to see Yoda making an appearance here with Luke on the island. As Luke struggles with destroying the ancient Jedi text, Yoda just made it go kablooey. It’s not particularly a highlight for me, but it’s cool to see the apprentice and the master reunited. Another reunion that made me tear up is Luke and Leia… especially when she gave the Han Solo’s dice he grabbed from the cockpit of the Millenium Falcon. I love when Leia said ‘Luke, I know what you’re going to say. I changed my hair.’ Ha! It feels like something Carrie Fisher herself would say. When Luke said to her (about Han) ‘he’s never really gone’ it feels like how Carrie herself is to the SW family and the fans. Her spirit will always be with the franchise.  Now for those who’ve seen this? Who do you think the Last Jedi is? Is it Luke or is it Rey? Thoughts on the kid in the last scene that hints he’s got the Force with him? My initial reaction after I saw this is it’s currently one of my favorites in the franchise! Well, after four days seeing it, I still stand by it. In fact, I don’t mind seeing this again by year’s end. It’s really got everything. Thrilling action, check. Intense lightsaber battle, check. Witty repartee, check. Emotional struggles, check. The action punctuates the story and that’s how it should be. Unlike the overwrought and mawkish prequels, Rian’s script has zest and wit, and also unafraid to poke fun at themselves. I also marvel at the cinematography by Steve Yedlin, a longtime Rian Johnson collaborator. So many iconic visuals that truly took my breath away, especially those on the island filmed in County Kerry, Ireland. And of course, John Williams’ iconic epic score still gives me the chills! By the time the end credits roll, I am already excited to see how the story goes from there. It’s great to have a filmmaker who evidently has been a fan of the franchise since he was a kid, but still also an ‘outsider’ who dared to take the 40-year-old saga into unexpected paths. The force is certainly strong with Rian Johnson, so I have no problem having him do the next Star Wars trilogy. I think time will be kinder to The Last Jedi than some “fanboy” Star Wars critics have been. There’s an apparent backlash to this film from the very same people who criticised JJ Abrams for “remaking A New Hope” for Johnson’s deviation from what fans “wanted” (whatever that means). I loved the film (despite a few niggling issues – the gambling planet, for example, was utter meh) and cannot wait to revisit this one multiple times to dig deeper into it. Hey Rodney! I actually like the gambling planet scene. Yeah people are gonna always complain about something. It’s either ‘too much of the same’ or ‘too different’ You really can’t please the fans, ahah. I feel the same about this film as with The Force Awakens, I enjoyed it but it seemed to me they introduced too many questions that may or may not get answered in the final film. I’ll probably see it again just because it looks great on the big screen. For some reason I enjoyed this more than Force Awakens. I just think it’s more engaging overall and yes it does look amazing on the big screen! Great review Ruth, I thought ‘The Last Jedi’ had flaws but on the whole it was a good ‘Star Wars’ film and I do like and fully support some of the unexpected creative choices made.  Rian Johnson delivers some incredible visuals and gives this entry it’s own unique flavour without seeming out of place in the overall canon. Hi Chris! Glad you don’t mind the unexpected creative choices, sounds like we’re in the minority amongst fans. This time I’m with the critics in that I think this is a great film and I for one don’t mind Rian in the director chair for future SW films. Ugh your review makes me wish I’d liked this movie more than I did. It just dragged for me, and I felt bored and antsy. I loved the force awakens, but this installment just didn’t sell me the ju ju I needed to feel fulfilled. And, I’m not even a fan boy! WTF, right?? Hi Courtney! Hey it’s ok that we disagreed on this. I wasn’t bored for the most part despite the super long running time. I guess I didn’t know what to expect but really enjoyed Rian’s direction. I’m not a fangirl at all, I guess I might just happen to be in the right mood when I saw it.  I came out of it giving it a 5 out of 5 but I’ve since brought that score down to a 4 after thinking about it a bit more and talking to others about their reaction. I do feel I need another viewing and I’m eagerly anticipating one. But, regardless, I really enjoyed it. I thought Rian Johnson did a terrific job just as JJ Abrams did in the last one. There were moments (fleeting I must admit) when this film featured some of the best bits of Star Wars ever – that opening battle… wow! I could quibble about some of the humour and its hammy delivery by Hamill or the feeling (like Abrams’ effort) this is a re-imagination of Empire Strikes Back or the point plot-wise of the gambling planet apart from (spoiler coming) the kid at the end and the connotations of his actions. But, all in all, I really did enjoy it and thought it an ideal entry in the Star Wars saga. Film is in my blood. LOVE movies of all genres, from Jane Austen to James Bond.

"Feb 8, 2019",POSITIVE,"It's a visually stunning movie, finding moments both macro and micro to highlight the beautiful imagination that Star Wars can evoke."
"Feb 6, 2019",POSITIVE," Star Wars The Last Jedi came in with some really high expectations. Star Wars The Force Awakens evoked a lot of questions and the Last Jedi trailer stirred up even more questions.  As a matter of fact, we came up with the top 5 burning questions for Star Wars The Last Jedi for your viewing pleasure. After viewing The Last Jedi, I think it’s fair to say that the film exceeded and circumvented my expectations all at the same time. Now just so you know, Star Wars The Last Jedi has a ton of surprises and twists. With that in mind, as I have always tried to provide spoiler-free reviews, I’ll try to be even more spoiler-free as possible. I understand some people still want to get a taste of what’s to come. Worry not because in just a few days, you can tune back in to this post to watch/listen to my spoiler discussion of the film. When the opening credits roll, it almost feels like you’re being transported back into time with the classic Star Wars music blasting, and the intro opening text. That sets the tone for the nice amount of nostalgia the film creates. Fortunately, the movie doesn’t entirely rely on the nostalgia factor as much as The Force Awakens. While there are obvious callbacks to previous characters and such, the Last Jedi does not become a modern day version of The Empire Strikes Back. Not only that, but there are so many climatic moments that will leave on you on the edge of your seat. There’s a nice balance of suspense, action, drama, and humor. Star Wars: The Last Jedi [Credit: Lucasfilm/Disney Motion Pictures]Director/writer  Rian Johnson deserves so much credit and praise for this film. (I can see why Disney has entrusted him to take on the new spinoff Star Wars trilogy.) One of my hopes with this movie was that it would really start to create its own original path in the Star Wars movie franchise. Johnson successfully does that by avoiding almost all expectations Star Wars fans may have had going into the film.  With the way the movie ends, the field is now wide open with where the next Star Wars movie can go. Johnson did stay true to some classic Star Wars elements. One of those elements was to ensure that The Last Jedi was full of those “Star Wars Life Lessons”. I thought it was brilliant how the film brings about a number of different lessons and themes through each of the experiences of the individual characters. The overall cinematography of this movie must be praised as well. The amazing visuals were simply captivating in this film. Maybe I’m being a prisoner of the moment, but I can’t recall a more visually stimulating spaceship battle. The usage of the environment and terrain was stunning in some scenes. And without question, there’s one particular scene with a spaceship that can only be described as epic! That scene is so jaw dropping,  that the sound is masterfully muted to match the level of suspense that the audience is feeling at that time. you’ll know it when you see it, but I can honestly say I’ve never seen a spaceship do what was done in that iconic sequence. Beyond even that, The Last Jedi will challenge what we thought we knew about the Force. I thoroughly enjoyed the radical new ways that the Force could be used in the film. Star Wars: The Last Jedi [Credit: Lucasfilm/Disney Motion Pictures]As previously mentioned, Johnson included the infusion of so much more humor compared to other Star Wars films. For a moment, I almost thought I was watching Spaceballs (1987).  I don’t want to say that the movie was comedic, but it did have some funny moments sprinkled throughout. I think the reason why this worked was because the humor made sense within the story. The humor was not shoe-horned in nor did it completely really distract or disrupt the tonality of the movie. Star Wars: The Last Jedi [Credit: Lucasfilm/Disney Motion Pictures]Now, let’s talk about some of these great characters! In my opinion, the supporting characters seemed to have outshined the main leading characters. I absolutely loved Kelly Marie Tran’s performance as “Rose”. She was a very unexpected character in a supporting role that simply delivers to the very end of the film. The most touching performance that will hit you right in the feels will be Carrie Fisher’s role. Given her unfortunate passing, it was wonderful to see her in the role of Princess Leia as she displayed a beautiful blend of strength, leadership and love through her character. When it came to Snoke, I first of all liked the fact that the CGI was handled very well. We absolutely got to see more of Snoke and, even better, we got to see his power on display. I thought his demonstration of power was extremely effective at showing just how much of a threat he can be. Probably one of my absolute favorite characters had to be that of “Poe Dameron” played by Oscar Isaac. Poe probably displayed the most character development of all the other characters. Last but not least, BB-8 is just a ton of fun and awesome!  Star Wars: The Last Jedi [Credit: Lucasfilm/Disney Motion Pictures]As for the heavy hitter characters, I think the one that stood out the most was Mark Hamill as “Luke Skywalker”. As you could see from the trailers, Luke Skywalker isn’t the happy go-lucky, optimistic Jedi that we knew from the original Star Wars films. Without going into spoiler territory, I really appreciated how his character had to go through his own journey in this film. Another kudos to Rian Johnson has to be mentioned here. Yet again, we have probably the most epic moment in Star Wars cinematic history unfold with Luke’s character. In the last couple of scenes of the film, Luke shines so brightly that I’m sure it’ll have the internet buzzing for years to come. Disclaimer: Before any die hard Star Wars fans want to come for my head, let me just say that these “Bad” critiques are incredibly mild. They do not kill the film or anything, but they still have to be noted. Star Wars: The Last Jedi [Credit: Lucasfilm/Disney Motion Pictures]First off, this movie feels every bit as long as the 2hrs and 32min run time states. Don’t get me wrong, there aren’t really any slow or dragging moments in the film that make the pacing feel too lengthy. Rather, there are a number of moments where it would appear as though the film could’ve/should’ve ended. We have a few big climactic scenes where you really think the movie is going to stop, but it only continues into another side story. Then that happens again, and again. Fortunately, every time you think the movie is about to end, they still give you another set of scenes that keep you entertained and intrigued to see more. However, you still will notice, at the very least, the prolonged time you’ve been sitting in that theater chair. Star Wars: The Last Jedi [Credit: Lucasfilm/Disney Motion Pictures]Okay, I feel kinda bad for going here, but I’ve got mention that I was not a fan of a particular scene with “Leia”. I’ll just say that the scene is a bit of a “reach” and doesn’t have a good enough contextual basis for the audience to connect with. In order for this very particular and standout scene to make sense, you have to jump through some mental hoops. First you have to  recall the previous original Star Wars films, and then you’ll have to make a huge assumption just for it to make sense. To me, it just needed a smoother transition for her actions to be a bit more believable. (If you listen to my spoiler-discussion, I dig a bit deeper into this.) I think one of the bigger issues that happens in this film is what appears to be the stagnant character development with the two leading characters of Rey and Kylo Ren. Compared to the other side characters who have some major challenges and internal battles to overcome, it didn’t appear as though Rey nor Kylo Ren actually progressed very much as characters. Let me be clear about this. I’m not saying that nothing happens to them, or that they don’t make certain decisions along their personal journeys. What I’m saying is that each character seems relatively the same as they were compared to The Force Awakens. You can’t say that for a character like Poe or even Luke, for example. Star Wars The Last Jedi is probably the best Star Wars film that we have to date! Hold on, pick up your jaw, and put your eyeballs back in their sockets. I should say, that Star Wars the Last Jedi is the best Star Wars film we have to date by default. This film is a natural progression of the Star Wars films because it incorporates all the good things we loved about the previous Star Wars films. Even better, this film drizzled a lot of originality by dismantling the Star Wars cinematic formula.  Going against the grain of what Star Wars fans may expect makes this film such a surprising and refreshing viewing experience. If you couldn’t tell by now, I absolutely believe that this was better than The Force Awakens. Star Wars: The Last Jedi [Credit: Lucasfilm/Disney Motion Pictures]If you’re considering to watch this film in 3D, feel free to do so. The movie is visually stunning and there are a number of intentional visuals to keep the 3D popping in various scenes. Personally, I’d recommend seeing this film in Dolby Atmos if your local theater provides that. The sound effects and musical score are something to experience in a theater setting. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an absolute must watch in theaters. Go see it and may the Force be with you! (You know I had to slip that in somewhere.)

"Jan 31, 2019",POSITIVE," In 2012, Disney bought Lucasfilm in a $4 billion dollar deal that had the potential to change the entire entertainment landscape overnight. Five years and three movies later, they are on the cusp of making back that initial investment, in a resurrection story for our times. Star Wars was a spent, moribund franchise, one with no foreseeable future, other than endless re-releases. It has been rebirthed as 21st-century mythos, with a new set of films. Our original beloved trio of characters grew up to become the elders we respect, while our new characters give fans a new set of archetypes that respects our intelligence. This winter’s ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"" directed by Rian Johnson, may be the most divisive film in the canon so far. Some of those who hate it claim that Johnson’s film ""killed their childhood."" And guess what? They’re right. When the original trilogy came out in the 1970s and 1980s, many current fans were children. Childhood was a time for simple answers. Good and bad were unequivocal, wins were forever, and everyone lived happily ever after. When someone felt a decent impulse and followed it, they automatically became a “good” character (i.e. Han Solo). When a “bad” guy felt a decent impulse and followed it, they were no longer “evil” (i.e. Darth Vader in ""Return of the Jedi""). But that’s not the way life works. Good people do terrible things, and bad people do small acts of kindness. Heroes aren't perfect — they can be as weak and small as everyone else. There is no such thing as happily ever after. When the prequels ended in 2005, Star Wars was all but dead. The reviews and fan reaction to the turn of the century films had been scathing. The only ones who had enjoyed them, it seemed, were those aged 7-14. Without meaning to, Lucas had taken his original, childlike trilogy, and made it a series that really was for kids. This reorientation of Star Wars for children wasn’t a complete disaster for Lucasfilm. Together with Warner Brothers, they followed up with a cartoon film, ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars,"" that begat a TV show of the same name, which then begat the current ""Star Wars: Rebels"" cartoon. But in the world of 2012, where ""Star Trek"" had just been rebooted, ""Game of Thrones"" had solidified its position as HBO’s new flagship show and ""The Avengers"" had opened to worldwide box office success, a few children’s cartoons weren’t going to cut it. Enter Disney. Their first move was to establish the new trilogy as successful. It needed to be familiar, but not too much. They turned to J.J. Abrams, who had proven his rebooting talent by remaking Star Trek for a 21st-century audience. Some complained that the result, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" was a little too familiar; an on-the-nose a remake of the original 1977 film. But 2015's ""The Force Awakens"" was an out-of-the-box success that brought in $2 billion dollars at the box office. Most importantly, it established a new model to build upon. Star Wars has always been, at its core, a story of archetypes. There’s a hero, a princess, a scoundrel and a villain. Our new protagonists had these features, and were diverse to boot. The Chosen One was finally female, heralding a wave of women taking the forefront in long-standing fantasy properties. But these weren’t the clear-cut archetypes of the original films. Rey wasn’t a spoiled kid with dreams of adventure. She was an orphan whose need to survive accidentally leads her to the Resistance. Finn wasn’t the scoundrel with a heart of gold, but an abused kid trying to learn to be brave. The villains — Kylo Ren and his sidekick Hux — were just angry young men playing with fire. (Not all the motifs were so changed, of course. Leia was the Mon Mothma-like Wise Rebellion Leader, Luke was the Yoda Jedi master, and Han Solo grew up to be, of all things, the next generation’s Obi-Wan Kenobi.) Abrams’ setup of this complex world allowed the franchise to branch out. The first stand-alone, ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" took the next step. Back in 1977, characters didn't die in films, other than a few extras. The 21st century changed all that with bloody, high-turnover ensemble shows like ""Game of Thrones"" and ""The Walking Dead."" ""Rogue One,"" directed by Gareth Edwards, gave Star Wars a chance to prove it could do the same. This was a big risk, and there were many at Disney who feared the audience response. As a result, the movie was a mess: a mash-up of six partial films with far too many cooks. Still, the ending maintained the new model's main lesson: Changing the world is a slow process, and although most of us won’t live to see the ultimate victory, the forgotten fallen are still critical rungs on the ladder. Our new characters once again rebuff easy categorizations. Just because two of our heroes undertake a daring mission doesn't automatically mean they’ll succeed. Just because the rebellious character thinks he’s right doesn’t mean he knows what’s going on. The smuggler doesn’t have a heart of gold, but his pockets are lined with it by the end of the film. This time our older heroes are allowed complexity too. Luke is a man of many sides, a hermit in the middle of nowhere who chose to go to a place where fish caretakers wait upon the Jedi like a luxury hotel. He’s self-righteous, yet has made mistakes with galaxy-level consequences. The simple hero he was all those decades ago was always a myth, one he even bought into — to his everlasting regret. Leia is still a self-rescuing princess, but now she’s showing layers of Jedi ability we’ve never seen, and putting down mutinies from her sickbed. In May of 2018 the next Star Wars standalone will arrive, focusing heavily on the backstory of Han Solo. Then in 2019, Disney will follow-up with the now-moved-to-December “Episode IX,” which will complete Lucas’ original Skywalker Saga. Will these movies continue to push this more mature narrative forward? Like ""Rogue One,"" the ""Han Solo: A Star Wars Story"" film is trying to change something about the originals, something that made Disney executives nervous all over again, to the point that they replaced directors midstream. Abrams will return for ""Episode IX."" We can only hope the result is slightly less messy than ""Rogue One,"" and at least as subversive as ""The Last Jedi."" Meanwhile, Rian Johnson has been put in charge of creating the next trilogy, the first not to feature Skywalkers at all. Johnson's ""Last Jedi"" killed our childhoods because 2017 wasn’t a good place for children. But it’s likely the next decade won’t be either. We have to grow up and take our place in history. With Johnson at the helm, it seems like Star Wars could finally be coming along with us for the ride. It may not be the reboot everyone wanted. But it’s the one we deserve.

"Jan 30, 2019",POSITIVE,The film is a great reminder to listen to your elders. [Full Review in Spanish]
"Jan 30, 2019",POSITIVE," For 40 years now, Star Wars has been an icon of blockbuster filmmaking, both for good and bad. At its best, it delivers deep emotion and spectacular action. At its worst, it delivers bungled dialogue and nauseating set-pieces. But the shackles of the past were thrown away with 2015’s The Force Awakens, and the franchise was back to its best. With the introduction of a new writer/director, Rian Johnson, there’s a sense of trepidation going into the latest chapter The Last Jedi. You can rest easy. He’s delivered the goods. The franchise is in safe hands, with Johnson crafting a bold, new vision for the saga unlike anything we’ve seen before. While pushing further towards a future free from the constraints of its history, the film still wisely keeps one foot firmly placed in deep admiration of the past. You can’t make a Star Wars story without respect to what’s come before. An enthralling and gripping piece of cinema that’s both sublimely moving and visually beautiful, The Last Jedi, while flawed, is a breath of fresh air you will want to experience again and again. So how to summarise this film’s plot without spoiling anything too major? Well, it’s best to stick with what you probably already know from the trailers, expand on that slightly, but leave the biggest surprises for your own viewing pleasure. Picking up shortly after the events of 2015’s The Force Awakens, the dastardly First Order, led by General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson, continuing to chew every piece of scenery), is now in the midst of an all-out assault on the dwindling Resistance, led by Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher, may she rest in peace). After a swarm of Star Destroyers discover the rebellion’s secret location, right in the middle of their mass evacuation, Leia and her rebels find themselves sitting ducks out in space, and quickly running out of fuel. Meanwhile, on the island where we left Rey (Daisy Ridley) and long-lost Jedi legend Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Rey is desperately attempting to recruit Luke to restore hope to the Rebellion cause and join his sister Leia in her fight against Hux and the evil Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). But our dear Luke has long parted ways with The Force, after his failure to stop Kylo Ren/Ben Solo (Adam Driver) from turning to the dark side left him broken and defeated. And yes – the island happens to be populated by the Porgs you’ve seen in the trailer and at every toy store lately. I’m happy to report they are devastatingly adorable, sparingly used, and not at all the franchise’s new Jar Jar Binks. Phew. As for our other heroes, Rebellion fighter Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and his brash and bold ways (i.e. he can’t follow orders) are causing clashes with Leia and her new offsider Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), a purple-haired senior member of the Resistance who takes a particular disliking to the trigger-happy Poe. Defected stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) has awoken from his coma and quickly made a new friend in Rose (Kelly Marie Train), a scrappy Resistance pilot who’s rather dazzled by Finn’s heroic reputation. As the pair head off on their own side-mission, they may just be the key to saving the day for the desperate Rebel fleet. That’s really all one can say without giving too much away. You can pretty much guess there’s plenty of huge space battles, dazzling lightsaber fights, epic moments of joy and sadness, and a whole swag of genuine shocks and surprises, all woven into these barest of plot details. For those concerned writer/director Rian Johnson would cheaply deliver a simple remake of The Empire Strikes Back, rest assured that is not the case. At all. Johnson has crafted something that of course pays deep tribute to the original films, but boldly carves its own path, stamped with the director’s indelible and unique style and vision. With films like Brick and Looper, Johnson has shown his flair for a more avant-garde style of filmmaking, doted with off-beat humour. Surprisingly, Disney has allowed him to inject the Star Wars franchise with plenty of moments of his surrealist talent. One scene involving Rey, a mirror-like alternate dimension, and a simple click of her fingers is truly beyond what we’re used to from these films, and yet, it somehow works completely. The humour can feel somewhat trite at times, and a little unusual for a Star Wars film. But in a narrative with a rather bleak tone, it’s desperately needed, and the jokes thankfully work more often than they don’t. In saying that, the screenplay is far from perfect, particularly around the film’s middle act where the action almost grinds to a halt, and plods along rather frustratingly. Of particular frustration is a rather unnecessary sequence involving Finn and Rose travelling to Canto Bight, a casino-esque city where rich and glamourous citizens gather to be…rich and glamourous. It’s here the film gets a little preachy, as it rather pointlessly attempts to provide biting commentary on notions of greed, excess, class status, and even animal cruelty. It’s admirable to see Johnson exploring themes unfamiliar to this franchise, but it feels so jarringly out-of-place, ultimately briefly pulling you right out of the story. If it doesn’t, I suggest you check out Netflix’s Okja, which handled these very themes far more cleverly. But all is forgiven with the film’s incredible final act, featuring some genuinely gripping and tense moments and a beautifully-filmed battle on the planet Crait, with its surface covered in crusted salt over crimson-red soil. The blood-coloured trails created by the action on the planet’s surface are downright stunning, and leave an impression like few other visuals in this epic film. For all of Johnson’s quirky storytelling, he still knows how to deliver the action and the spectacle. The mix of CGI and physical production is seamless, and the space battles are thrilling and spectacular. The lightsaber duels are some of the best we’ve ever seen, all choreographed with such wondrous precision and intensity. As a visual piece of cinema, it’s another triumph for this franchise. The action is terrific, but the focus on character is the film’s crowning glory. Johnson’s screenplay creates multiple narratives within narratives, but he’s a filmmaker who knows how to handle them perfectly, and nothing with our returning cast ever feels underdeveloped. As a writer, he’s taken the foundations of our characters set by J.J. Abrams, and takes them into deeper (and sometimes darker) territories. The evolution of the strange connection between Rey and Kylo Ren is a particular highlight, and both Ridley and Driver take their characters to wonderful new levels. Ren is still heavily burdened by the deep conflict he feels between his past and future, and Driver superbly handles the psychological torment his character constantly struggles with. For those who had reservations about his performance in The Force Awakens, prepare to be blown away by the film’s conclusion. Poe is given far more to do in this film, and Isaac runs with the opportunity to take his character further, particularly towards the film’s climax. His comedic interaction with General Hux is another of the film’s highlights, and Hux himself gets far more great moments than he did in the first film. Finn suffers with the least character progression, which is a damn shame, as Boyega has proven he is worthy of a great storyline. Maybe next time. And sadly, once again, Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) is completely wasted. While we may find these characters in the same place we left them in The Force Awakens, they all ultimately wind up in very, very different places over the course of the film, setting up an incredible closing chapter to this trilogy in two-years time. And then there’s our beloved original siblings, Luke and Leia. As difficult as it is to watch, knowing it’s her final performance, the film is a beautiful tribute to both Carrie Fisher (the film is dedicated to her, which elicited huge applause from my cinema) and Princess Leia. As always, Fisher gives such gravitas to her performance, and Leia will always stand as her immense legacy to cinema. Hamill is sublime as the bitter and defeated old man Luke has become. His character arc is ultimately the film’s glory, and it’s a beautiful journey to travel on. He delivers such deep complexity and tragic pain to Luke, and it’s a staggering difference to the hero we once knew. When brother and sister finally reunite, it’s genuinely cinematic magic. Bring the tissues. Unfortunately the same can’t be said for the new additions to the existing cast of characters. Rose is rather adorable, both instantly lovable and endearing, but outside of a brief plot-line involving her sister, there’s barely any character development for our plucky new Rebel. Regardless, it’s impressive to see an Asian heroine front and centre in a Star Wars film, even if there’s perhaps a hint of ulterior motives behind it *cough* Chinese box-office dollars *cough*.  Admiral Holdo may be shrouded in mystery for most of the film, but she’s a fairly unnecessary addition to the story. And the less said about Benicio del Toro’s completely useless new character DJ, the better. Both actors, normally so great, are relatively wasted and underused, and they ultimately steal focus and screen-time from far more worthy characters. In terms of its technical achievements, it should come as no surprise the film looks and sounds phenomenal. Composer John Williams is his typical best, injecting his score with both nods to the past and creations of the future. It’s the kind of stirring score we always expect from the master film composer, and it never feels too familiar or overdone. Steve Yedlin’s cinematography is truly gorgeous, as is the production and costume design from Rick Heinrichs and Michael Kaplan respectively. The film is perhaps a little too long, and editor Bob Ducsay could have been a tad more generous with his trimming, especially around the middle portion of the film. But it’s a minor quibble in such an enjoyable and entertaining piece of cinema. For all its issues, Rian Johnson has delivered something entirely fresh to a franchise now in its eighth film. That in itself is a remarkable achievement that has to be admired. He’s taken great risks and made some incredibly bold choices to deliver something that feels both touchingly familiar and daringly original. It’s an evolution of Star Wars to new places, yet still remains authentically grounded in a universe beloved by so many. Every bit as enjoyable and entertaining as the original trilogy, The Last Jedi is not exactly perfect, but it gets damn close."
"Jan 29, 2019",POSITIVE," The stylish episode VIII of the Star Wars franchise, the second of a trilogy that began in 2015 with “Star Wars: The Force Awakens”, was given the title of “The Last Jedi” and keeps dividing audiences worldwide. While its visual impact is undeniable, old and new characters work together to infuse zest and grittiness in an impetuous inspiration by Rian Johnson (“Brick”, “Looper”), who penned and directed with equal doses of passion and fascination. The director actually captured the tonal spirit of the preceding episodes and elevated it through bold and fresh ideas. However, this spacial opus could have run shorter than the two hours and a half without major loss. The spectacular battles between the dominant First Order, an evil military junta commanded by the Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), and the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), are in the center of the attention. However, and because this is far from being a tacky tale, one can find a decent emotional side attached to it, as well as a winning humor, which associated to speedy action scenes, regales with an inviting diversion. In this episode, Rey (Daisy Ridley) travels to the secluded planetary island of Ahch-To, where Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), a Jedi master turned hermit, decided to hide six years before. She wants to convince him to join the Resistance. After the initial stubbornness and refusal, Luke ends up accepting the challenge and even teaches her the ways of the Jedi as he sees a lot of courage, righteousness, and skills in her that are so characteristic from The Force. However, Rey communicates telepathically with the venomous Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), son of Leia and Han Solo, whose ambiguous behavior and sly intentions will drag her to Snoke’s den. On another front, we have the former stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) teaming up with Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), a maintenance worker for the Resistance that appears for the first time in the series. I don’t see her as a super strong character, though. Also, the often funny X-wing fighter pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), does what he has to do for the sake of the Light with fearless bravura, even if he needs to confront his inflexible, stern superior, the Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern).  As a bold director, Johnson didn’t turn his face to risk or experience and his efforts become successful. The stunning tete-a-tete between Skywalker and Kylo Ren was the most exciting moment of the film, culminating in a sophisticated artifice of teleportation. It felt like I was in a video game without being able to control it. “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” was dedicated to Carrie Fisher, who died of cardiac arrest on December 15. The last installment of the trilogy will be released in 2019, having J.J. Abrams once again in the director’s chair."
"Jan 26, 2019",POSITIVE," Hey, it’s time to review the new Star Wars, a movie you’re probably going to see anyway! As someone who really doesn’t hold much affection for the Star Wars franchise, my love of The Force Awakens really shocked me. Not only did it end up making my end of the year 10 Best Movies in 2015, but it also was what I still think of as a pitch perfect blockbuster – one that breathed new life into that universe, introduced nuanced and compelling characters, and looked pretty terrific while doing it. I couldn’t have imagined a situation where I found myself caring about where the plight of the Jedi and their ragtag companions could possibly go, but yet somehow JJ Abrams, Kathleen Kennedy and company all pulled it off. In the between time, I had to suffer through Rogue One, but it was okay, because I knew Rian Johnson would be at the other end of that tunnel to cradle me in his bearded embrace. His The Last Jedi, which picks up literally within moments of the end of The Force Awakens, paints a picture of a struggle that never took a breath. The Resistance, led by General Leia, find themselves in the middle of a back and forth with General Hux’s First Order. Hux, truly the bitchiest member of this new iteration of the Empire, gets into a humorous bit of dialogue with a solo Poe Dameron scouting just ahead of a charge of bombers who are attempting to lay waste to the First Order’s colossal Dreadnought. While this event will set the stage for what drives Poe, Finn, Leia, a few new additions to the cast, and the entire Resistance itself, it’s also probably the last time audiences are held subject to the standard light and dark side debate that has populated these films as a rule. It was the accepted line of thinking that the guys dressed in black are bad, and the scrappy underdogs in white, and various lighter shades are the good guys. Well, Mr. Johnson was going to have none of that, as The Last Jedi is a film all about the debate of what lies between those two extremes. Not every character necessarily approaches moral grey tones, but even those characters that are what we deem to be inherently “good” or “bad” are faced with conflicts that drive a question into the morality of their cause. A daring choice for the world’s most popular blockbuster series, but when Johnson (who both writes and directs here) centers in directly on that theme, The Last Jedi does something that is all too rare for the Star Wars series: introducing new notions within the sphere of its seemingly impenetrable worldview, and new ways of how we might conceive the two warring factions and the people that have to work for them and the little people who find themselves under their boot heel. But, as a caveat, the further away the filmmaker gets from this novel approach, the less effective the film becomes. This can be seen clearly in the division of narrative between the three major protagonists of The Force Awakens. Each hero from that last outing, Rey, Finn, and Poe are given their own slice of the film within which to work, and it’s clear where in each of the three that Johnson’s interests chiefly lie. Rey’s storyline, the most effective of the trio, finds her making contact with the long-lost Luke Skywalker in an attempt to bring him back into the fold of the Resistance, and in turn determine her own place within it and The Force itself. Additionally, this is where Kylo Ren, the wayward son of the now deceased Han Solo and Leia, is directly involved – and if this series does nothing else, it absolutely, 100%, proves to me that he is the most unique and well-developed character of the Star Wars universe. Here, he is basically the mouth piece for Johnson’s vision of this struggle, and every scene he and Rey share outshines everything else that surrounds it. We knew Adam Driver was a compelling and nuanced actor, even before this film began to roll, but the surprise here is just how well Daisy Ridley is able to match Driver’s well-known intensity. Luke plays a sort of middle-man between them, and it’s not a stretch to say this is surely Mark Hamill’s best outing in the role. He’s given a good deal of meat to chew on as a bearded, reclusive version of the previous trilogy’s central hero. The most welcome element on hand is just how effectively Hamill carves out this elder version of the character and stands separate from any temptation to make him the “Obi Wan” of this entry. From the emotional beats he presents, and the general sense of stubbornness throughout, you can conceivably believe this is the man that Luke grew into. Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron gets a lot more to work with this time around. Rather than just being the very likable, handsome pilot guy, he’s now the Commander of the Resistance fleet and our POV within the machinations of their operating order. Through his story, we spend most of our time with Leia, as well as Lauren Dern’s purple-haired Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo. In this way, Poe’s end of the tale works as a counter-point to the ongoing struggle between Hux and Kylo Ren. In both cases, we see the inner-workings of office politics and their respective power struggles. Poe is faced with issues related to the chain of command, especially in times of crisis – there’s a not too subtle influence of Battlestar Galactica present here. It is an arc that is mostly effective, though somewhat truncated by its proximity to the least compelling storyline of the film. Which brings us to poor old Finn. Finn, who occupied an exciting space within The Force Awakens (that of the faceless Stormtrooper turned hero), is saddled with what is basically a gigantic fetch-quest and the on-boarding of a new character in Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose Tico, a member of the Resistance who volunteers to help him on this side-mission that feels like it lasts 10 years. Not only are the sequences they are involved in the least exciting of the entire affair, but they also are the stretches that rely the most on green screen and iffy special effects, neither of which are Johnson’s specialty. One of the troubles here is that Finn basically is static throughout, and he’s grafted to what is basically a non-entity in Rose. A character, who in theory, fits right alongside the themes that are being developed in all three storylines to some degree, but the execution of the character is the thing, and Rose never seems to grow beyond “earnest” with a connection between these two that feels rushed to say the least. There’s a lot of tell here, and nowhere near enough show. And to briefly get back to the subject of Carrie Fisher, her return here is bittersweet, as her passing last year does indeed echo within every scene she appears. But thankfully, she is the centerpiece of two of The Last Jedi‘s most touching moments, one that is especially artful and the other overflowing with emotion, striking a nerve in a moment that is sure to choke up audiences. Despite the script’s occasional lapses, there is at least some worthwhile study for the cinephiles in the crowd, as the stark contrast between the Abrams approach: with his wide environmental vistas and shots that are mostly at eye-level with his actors vs. that of Johnson who takes a slightly more “up from the ground” viewpoint, with much of the action occurring inside somewhat claustrophobic settings, makes for a unique point of comparison between two very different filmmakers. It’s not that I expect much auteur imprint, but it’s nice to get a hint of the artist behind the camera, which is apparent in both instances, and likely where a lot of the rewatch value will be found where this reviewer is concerned. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a tale of one really great “A plot” and character progression, and a pair of solid and undercooked storylines, respectively, that are tied together as a sort-of “B and C plot”. The good news is that by the time the movie enters its climatic final moments, it hits a pretty good groove before the credits, though the way it comes together isn’t exactly graceful. On the whole, it’s an outing that could have done a little more with less, and while Johnson and company are bursting with ideas (some of which defy expectations), they don’t all work and the overly bloated running time of 152 minutes is a testament to that fact. The truth is, there’s an entire segment of the film that could have been excised completely from the script and not much would have been lost. When it works, it really works, but the fat overwhelms it all too often. Johnson acts as a sort of caretaker to the concepts and characters introduced in 2015, and to his credit, he gets them from one end of the film to the other without any major hiccups (save for Finn); but with that said, I find myself far more enthused to see Abrams pick the baton back up for Episode IX and close out what he started. They should have gone with the novel approach in the sense of setting the trilogy in the existing movie and novel canon that already existed. Give us new Legends ! I’ll see it anyway, to see Carrie Fisher one last time, and for Hamill in a meaty role. No idea if I’ll see any more SW. I have no interest at all in the “young Han Solo” movie. I figured reviews like mine are deep in the minority, as I’m seeing a lot of effusive praise in my immediate sphere (and a pretty high Rotten Tomatoes score fwiw), though I haven’t had time to go scouring to really get a sense of the consensus.  Thought my tastes must be the inverse of yours when you said you love TFA but didn’t like RO, but I saw TLJ last night and couldn’t agree more. Finn’s storyline is actually pretty dire. Comparing the pretty awesome into sequence to the pointless nonsense of the casino planet is like night and day.  Also, the constant sappy mottos (“The spark that will relight the rebellion”) and inorganic dialogue relating to good vs evil seriously hurt the conversations. Both the serious tone and jokes worked well, but sometimes the comic diversions got prequel trilogy levels of silly. The inconsistent flow of time was a constant irritation. Some plot details, like Rose’s medallion, or Holden’s withholding of her plan, were frustratingly stupid. I never cared about the stakes, and it’s a film with no ending.  Some amazing parts, too. The intro and the storylines of Rey, Luke and Kylo were ace, and the final battle was in parts quite cool. Overall, though, not a great film. There was a good hour in the middle that I wouldn’t want to watch ever again. I don’t know why anyone would be surprised that “The Force Awakens” is a really good movie. It’s essentially a remake of the original and that is a flat out great motion picture. Not a great sci-fi or nerd flick. It’s a legitimately masterful exercise in storytelling. “The Last Jedi” can be no worse than the fifth best Star Wars flick because there’s some genuinely good stuff in it and none of the bad stuff is shoved down your throat as hard as it was in the prequels. This movie is not going to age well, though, and it’s so fundamentally flawed that I cannot comprehend the amount of worshipful praise it’s received from a lot of critics. Saw it yesterday. It’s a good but not great movie. Hamill is excellent, the frail-looking Carrie Fisher is touching, all the acting was at least competent. Rose was a good addition to the cast. I was glad that — SPOILER ALERT — Ren’s parents turned out to be nameless nobodies. That was realistic. Maybe now people can stop speculating that Luke is her father. I was pretty satisfied overall. I could probably nitpick over things, and probably will later. At least it was better than Rogue One (2 hours of boredom, capped by an exciting battle). I was never bored during Last Jedi."
"Jan 26, 2019",POSITIVE," It’s 2017 and it’s time to write about Luke Skywalker being a show-stealing character… It’s one of the many weirder things about Star Wars being back, but I’m happy to see the character get to put in another great appearance. The film overall can be summed up like this: Great opening, great ending, dull middle. Two out of three ain’t bad! Let’s take a closer look then! Only General Leia Organa’s band of Resistance fighters stand against the rising tyranny, certain that Jedi Master Luke Skywalker will return and restore a spark of hope to the fight. Rey (Daisy Ridley) – Rey has come from obscurity to realise she has a strong connection to the Force. She has found the legendary Luke Skywalker and hopes he can help point her in the right direction. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) – Luke failed his own nephew Ben Solo and has since ran off to hide, wishing to die amongst the ruins of the first Jedi temple. Can the recently visited Rey change his mind? Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) – A low-tier member of the Resistance who idolizes those at the top. The First Order took everything away from both her and her sister, and she is happy to help fight them any way she can. Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) – A vice admiral (GASP!) in the Resistance. She can be a little standoffish, a little hard to crack, but does have the Resistance’s interests at heart. The first thing that pops into my mind is Luke Skywalker’s arc. Mark Hamill has never been better, which is good because the material he’s been asked to act has never been more complex. Luke’s a broken and bitter man when Rey first meets him, and to eventually hear him talk about the old Jedi order and himself as arrogant, short-sighted and pretty much stupid was an eye-opener. He was right though! He momentarily had a moment of weakness when he felt Ben Solo’s darkness growing and thought to kill him in his sleep, and this lead to Ben waking, seeing what was going on and eventually go crazy. Just one, tiny thought, and it cost him everything. Instead of blaming Snoke (who was manipulating Ben’s darkness) and fight him, he ran in shame. Heavy stuff, not very Luke Skywalker-like as I mentioned in Force Awakens, but writer/director Rian Johnson made the best of a bad situation. When Rey goes off to fight, he gets visited by Yoda, who pretty much tells him he was right, mistakes have been made in the past, but forget about the old order and use your mistakes to teach. Oh what’s that? The rest of the movie? Right, well, the relationship between Rey and Kylo Ren was great in this. The two become connected via the Force, able to speak and even touch each other halfway across the galaxy, despite everything the two form a bond, with Rey believing that Ren can be saved. She goes off to meet him and ends up in handcuffs and brought to Snoke, who for the record orchestrated all of this. This plays out almost exactly the like the scenes between the Emperor, Luke and Vader in Return of the Jedi, except Ren sneakingly kills Snoke and then battles his guards alongside Rey. It was a great moment, mostly because of how Snoke “felt” Ren about to ignite his lightsaber and “strike down the one he wants to kill”, but didn’t realise his apprentice was manipulating Luke’s old lightsaber that was on Snoke’s throne rather than his own one, leading to his end. A very clever scene, and the battle between Rey, Ren and the guards was great! Sadly for Rey, Kylo Ren now claims he’s going to tare down everything old and rebuild it anew and wants Rey by his side to do it, which of course Rey wants no part of. The two fight over Luke’s old sabre before being blown backwards. Rey escapes and rejoins up with the Resistance and Kylo Ren becomes the new Supreme Leader, setting up a big battle between the two in Episode IX. It’s a very fun dynamic. One of the best scenes has to be Vice Admiral Holdo and her suicide ship ram. Basically Snoke’s impossibly gigantic ship is looming over the remains of the Resistance fleet, so she, alone on the cruiser, points it at the super-large vessel and light-speeds through a good portion of it. It was so beautifully shot as soon as it happens all sound cuts out and your treated to a light show as the ship explodes and nearby star destroyers are lit up by it. It’s such a great moment. I also have to say that this film does a great job of making the Resistance out to be against the wall, that’s for sure. They lost their entire governing body in Episode VII, here they lose a bunch of ships and soldiers in the opening battle, including Admiral Ackbar (no!!) and every other high-ranking general in the Resistance barring Leia, and eventually are down to one ship, then just a group of them in a small factory on a salty planet. Talk about underdogs! Okay, so this film isn’t perfect. It really sags in the middle, after the Resistance start to pull away from the enemy fleet, they two sets of ships get into some sort of… space… lock… thing, where the First Order can’t catch up to the Resistance ships so just slowly barrage their shield for the hell of it and wait for them to run out of fuel. This is the set up for, like, over an hour of the film, possibly an hour and a half. During this we get some good Luke and Rey training scenes, but we also get a subplot of Finn and Rose going to a casino planet and trying to find a codebreaker, then freeing a bunch of tamed and mistreated animals, make their way back, get on board Snoke’s ship, get caught, and escape… all of which has no effect of any of the plot. It’s complete filler, with the possible exception of getting Rose and Finn close, for presumably romantic purposes in Episode IX, but you could literally cut that whole thing out and it would make no difference. Captain Phasma, who literally did nothing of note in Force Awakens returns! … and gets swiftly beaten by Finn and seemingly killed in minutes. Jeez… why bring her back at all?! Although I get you needed someone to manipulate Ben Solo and command the First Order, but Snoke in the end was pretty pointless. He was a means to give Kylo Ren powers and then thrown to the side when it was time for Ren to take command. I’m sure he’ll have a good backstory in expanded media, but still… seems like a waste. Especially since I actually liked his cheesy evil ways in this film, even though I liked his death scene… Hmmm… kind of a mixed bag, this one. Well then, as I summed up in the opening paragraph, this film starts off great and ends great, but sags in the middle. That being said I’m almost tempted to give it 5 stars for giving such a great send off to Luke Skywalker (although I’m sure he’ll be back as a Force Ghost!), and throw in the great Rey-Kylo Ren stuff… Erm… Hmm… Nah, I still can’t quite give it 5, during the dull middle I was metaphorically checking my watch to see how much time had passed, waiting for something exciting to happen. No matter how fantastic the bread is, I can’t forgive a disappointing filling. Still, well worth your while going to see! I didn’t quite buy Luke drawing his sword. When he did so in return it was under a much more intense situation, and Luke would have likely developed at least SOMEWHAT more control as time passed. I can see the thought crossing his mind but there’s a difference between that and ACTUALLY drawing your weapon. All in all it just didn’t work for me."
"Jan 19, 2019",POSITIVE," Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Rogue One were both box-office successes and heralded as the return of the blockbuster franchise king, but both have a similar long-term problem: They hang onto nostalgia for the 1977 classic for dear life. My review of The Force Awakens called it the first “OK” Star Wars movie; Aly’s review of Rogue One called it “flawed but enjoyable.” I still rewatch them; the characters in Awakens especially are dazzling. But after two movies that so directly called back to Star Wars: A New Hope, it was natural to start wondering if Disney only had one trick up its sleeves with this new set of films. So … Star Wars: The Last Jedi has the unenviable task of proving whether the Star Wars franchise still has meaning, and it manages to with tremendous success. Deeper, broader, funnier and more thrilling than its predecessor, The Last Jedi isn’t only the best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back, it’s the first Star Wars movie in 30 years to truly feel like an evolution of the franchise. It may also prove to be one of the most controversial films in the series. The story picks up where Awakens left off, separating our core trio of heroes — Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). Rey has travelled to the ancient Jedi temple Ach-To to meet Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in hopes of luring him back into the Resistance to retaliate against the evil First Order, led by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), Hux (Domnhall Gleeson) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Finn is unconscious in a medical bay after a battle with Kylo Ren, and Poe is helping lead the Resistance evacuation. In classic Star Wars fashion, their stories separate and converge at different points. It creates an odd, but not unfamiliar, pacing dynamic that writer-director Rian Johnson navigates as gracefully as he can, slowly building thematic resonance between their separate adventures. Strength of theme is where The Last Jedi separates itself from the other movies and where it is most similar to The Empire Strikes Back. While it moves the overall story of the trilogy further, it also exists within a self-contained unit of story that explores several specific ideas: the nature of war, the meaning of the Force, what legacy means. Each of the characters’ individual stories play off these ideas, and all of them contribute to the film’s final statement. Yes, there are space battles, lightsaber fights and other dramatic reveals, but beneath it all is a story of a galaxy at war and doing the absolute best you can do under the circumstances. It’s a much more contemporary understanding of war than the original trilogy ever provided in that it understands conflict is perpetual and difficult to definitively divide into “good” and “bad.” As the originals reflected World War II and the prequels reflected Vietnam and Iraq, this tale borrows from our globalized, millennial understanding of war as a condition and collapse as ongoing. It is marvelous. The performances are all as good as they’ve ever been — particularly Hamill, whose reprise as Luke is everything you can ever expect, and maybe more. Ridley, Driver, Boyega and Isaac also bring real humor and depth to their characters, given far more nuance here than in Awakens. The standout here, though, is the late Carrie Fisher, whose General Leia more than gets her due. It’s a stark contrast from J.J. Abrams’ direction of Fisher in The Force Awakens, in which he seemed unsure how to light or even shoot the actress. Johnson knows what Fisher can do, and he lets her do it. It’s a tragedy that we will never see another Star Wars film with her actually in it, but it’s also a wonder we ever got this one. There are many plot twists in The Last Jedi that I’m hesitant to spoil, but it’s worth addressing how deeply controversial many of Johnson’s decisions may prove to be. The fact is that the Star Wars franchise has always been, and may always be, about that core mythological story contained in the first three movies. A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi are the great 20th-century American mythology. Their prequel films are meant to be watched after them (that whole “machete order” bull about watching them between Empire and Return misunderstands how storytelling works) and their “expanded universe” of novels, comics, games and TV shows all are meant to be enjoyed in the orbit of those three movies. The new Disney era has so far churned out a remake of and a direct prequel to A New Hope. The prequels were three movies all leading to A New Hope. The Last Jedi is the first Star Wars movie in years to feel like it exists in a moral and philosophical universe that expands upon, rather than takes comfort in, that first movie. It takes its time in the middle, doing the hard work of setting up stories for every character that all pay off in the final act. Part of this is because The Force Awakens did a genuinely poor job creating threads for this movie to pick up; another is that Rian Johnson is interested in telling a story that echoes through each individual arc. It’s a movie that wears its ideas and cinematic influences on its sleeve, a movie that aims for something higher. It’s about hope in the darkest of times — you could argue that’s the core thesis of the original trilogy and certainly Rogue One, and you would be right. But it’s more than just that. It’s about the legacy of hope, the imperfection of heroes, the passing of knowledge down from one generation to another in the name of something better. It captures the eternal struggle — not between good and evil but within the lived experience of individual people, faced with their own conflicts and hurdles. Beyond Skywalkers, Vaders and redemptions, Jedi, Sith and Empires. “Legacy” is the buzzword for reinvigorated franchises these days, and many use it as an excuse to ramp up the same old stories with mere window dressing. The Last Jedi is something new, something beautifully realized that plays off what came before while finding a new direction. You can’t destroy the past. You can only learn from it. For the first time, it feels like the Star Wars saga truly has."
"Jan 10, 2019",POSITIVE," It is a fair criticism to say that Star Wars: The Force Awakens is very similar to the original Star Wars and there was some concern that its successor would be a repeat of The Empire Strikes Back. While the two films share some of the same themes, for instance, The Last Jedi is certainly a much darker film than the first in its trilogy, and it offers a different and much-needed perspective on the Star Wars Universe. However, it is still a fun and wild ride that could leave the viewer breathless depending on how willing they are to embrace a new kind of story in a much-loved world. With a running time of 2 hours and 31 minutes, it is no surprise that a lot happens in The Last Jedi. There is very little filler and the story is jam-packed with character development, long-awaited reveals, and story progression. The film takes place over only a few days and it is tightly focused on giving a full accounting of all aspects of the story. The film picks up where The Force Awakens left off, with Rey (Daisy Ridley) handing Luke (Mark Hamill) the lightsaber while elsewhere the Rebels flee the impending threat of the First Order.  While I don’t want to give away any plot details, I will say there are some very satisfying answers given regarding character backgrounds and motivations that may be divisive among fans, but I found most of them appropriate for the time we are living in and this version of the Star Wars universe. The original cast members play bigger roles than in the previous film, but they are for the most part passive and allow for the next generation to take up the mantle of leadership. The Last Jedi is visually beautiful with incredible detail and tastefully used CGI, but even the most fantastic of the many fights and space battles take a backseat to the character-driven story. Where The Force Awakens dipped its toes into the pool of diverse casting, The Last Jedi makes a spectacular dive and provides a wide range of characters. Most of the new people who are introduced are people of color and/or women and they are given the roles of heroes and villains instead of sideline supporters. Carrie Fisher’s Leia is finally given the scenes she has always deserved, showing her skill at leadership and giving us a hint at how she has kept the Rebel Alliance together all these years. The subtle complexity of Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) is the perfect example of how this film is an expansion of all the previous entries in the Star Wars universe. Rian Johnson’s script uses several callbacks to both The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, but subverts them in a way that is rarely seen in franchise films. Instead of using them as nostalgia triggers, The Last Jedi reminds viewers of what has come before and then purposefully diverges from those choices to illustrate the danger of repeating our mistakes. Our three main characters, Rey, Finn (John Boyega), and Poe (Oscar Isaac), drive the story with their hope, their failure, and their desire to make the world a better place. That is where the difference between this film and all the others is the most striking; it explicitly states that their struggle is not just about defeating the bad guy, but about forging something new and better for those they love and those who will come after. The Last Jedi is by no means a perfect film, and your enjoyment of it will vary depending on your reactions to the plot and certain changes that are made to previously established rules, but it is told with an incredible skill and is riveting to watch. The information that has been revealed allows for intriguing possibilities and the implications for future installments will provide ample fodder for discussion. The Last Jedi is Disney’s best contribution to the Star Wars canon so far and we can only hope that the final film of this trilogy will live up to the new standard.

"Jan 8, 2019",POSITIVE," Star Wars: The Last Jedi has finally hit theaters. But who is the Last Jedi, really? And what to make of the longest running Star Wars film in the franchise’s history? One thing is certain: regardless of how much you enjoy the film as a whole, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is designed to wring out every possible emotion from its audience that it can. There is much at stake and director Rian Johnson knows this, knows that the film’s emotional core is going to be the primary takeaway no matter what happens on screen. He does everything possible to make certain that there is always something to feel, even if there isn’t always something to track logically. The biggest problem with The Last Jedi is that there is far too much packed into it. The longest Star Wars film before Episode VIII was Episode II: Attack of the Clones, which was mired with pacing issues, and Last Jedi is unfortunately no different. It somehow manages to have even more story threads going than any installment of the prequels ever had, and is incapable of shepherding each of them to a satisfying conclusion. There are a few diversions too many while the central storyline (surrounding the fate of the Resistance and Rey’s time spent with Luke Skywalker) needs a sharper focus. The new characters that Johnson introduces us to shine brightly, but need more time to grow. Laura Dern is spellbinding as Amilyn Holdo, but the character’s history needs more context for her overall role in the film to make sense. (She is featured heavily in the YA book about Leia’s early days in the Rebellion, Leia: Princess of Alderaan, but you barely get a sense of that past with her role in the film.) Kelly Marie Tran flipping sparkles in her role as Rose Tico, Resistance maintenance worker who sticks to Finn’s side, but she deserves more attention than the film is capable of giving her, particularly given how important she is to the overall plot. Benicio del Toro’s mysterious turn as “DJ” is an odd extra bit of casting that reads as though Johnson just really wanted the guy in the movie and basically let him do whatever he wanted. He’s fun to watch, but it’s still a bit confusing as to why he’s there. There are some clever curveballs that Johnson throws into the tale. While much early speculation from fans spouted the common suggestion that The Last Jedi would likely mirror The Empire Strikes Back, there’s far less of the movie in there than one might have anticipated. Instead, there are several places where this film holds narrative hands with Return of the Jedi, often in the most unexpected ways. Occasionally the pieces where you can spot connections to the original Star Wars trilogy are incredibly jarring, but Episode VIII has far too much going on in it to feel like a solid rehashing of previous films. Most of the overstuffed issues of Last Jedi come down to extra locations that we don’t need or attempts to lighten the tone that don’t fully succeed. It reads as though Johnson was concerned about leaving the film without enough laughs, but many of the jokes are oddly out of place. (The much-anticipated porgs are cute and actually pretty fun to watch on their own, but why they needed to be in this film in particular is anyone’s guess.) The detour to Canto Bight, the casino world full of high-rollers that was previewed heavily by Vanity Fair before the film’s release, is a very distracting B-plot that fails to pay out dividends in the film’s larger scheme, making it a confusing and lengthy diversion. But despite the unevenness of the film overall, The Last Jedi succeeds in the places where it needs to the most; specifically, in reintroducing audiences to Luke Skywalker, giving more background on Ben Solo’s fall to the Dark Side, and allowing Rey to continue to continue her journey in this story. Mark Hamill has been waiting for this since he stood on a cliffside in The Force Awakens and didn’t say a word, and he gives everything to the performance. Luke Skywalker’s presence carries the weight of this massive tale in most respects, and that presence forces the audience to ask important questions about the nature of this galaxy far, far away; the idea of what balance in the Force truly looks like, the difficulty of inhabiting a legendary figure who is still a flesh-and-blood person, the true purpose of owning one’s failures. The pain that comes from bearing the Skywalker name (for both Luke and Leia) is not made simple for the purposes of this story—Anakin and Padmé’s children have suffered dearly for their legacy, and it’s clear that the galaxy over-relies on them to that end. The knowledge that Carrie Fisher is gone is the sharpest sting of watching The Last Jedi, and it can’t help but stand out in light of the movie’s arc; when these films started, the plan was to have Force Awakens focus on Han, Last Jedi focus on Luke, and the final film focus on Leia. The events of Episode VIII offer a perfect bridge to that arc, begging questions about Leia’s way forward and the extreme personal sacrifices that can accompany being a leader and a literal embodiment of hope. The greatest loss that we suffer in The Last Jedi is the knowledge that we will never see the Episode IX that could have been. We will never watch our general complete her story. Still, the saga continues, and this chapter ends with the sensation of a freshly opened wound. It’s hardly surprising for the middle chapter of a three-part story, but all pain is unique. The Force Awakens came for your heart, but The Last Jedi is here for your spirit. With stakes that high, Episode IX is a frightening prospect indeed. [For the sake of allowing others to enjoy the film, we ask for NO SPOILERS to be given about The Last Jedi in the comments.] Emmet Asher-Perrin kept all of her feelings out of this review, and will proceed to eat a million cookies in self-congratulation.

"Dec 17, 2018",POSITIVE," Two years after The Force Awakens, Star Wars is back with The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson’s take on the franchise and the eighth instalment in the saga. Given Johnson’s penchant for character-driven movies and his sharp eye for a beautiful visual, anticipation was high for what he could do in the galaxy far, far away – and given the incredible success of the marvellous The Force Awakens, the pressure was on and the stakes were high. The Republic has been decimated and the ragtag Resistance is on the run from the actually massive First Order and their deadly duo – Kylo Ren (Driver) and Supreme Leader Snoke (Serkis). Having secured a huge victory and then suddenly suffering a massive defeat, General Leia Organa (Fisher), Poe Dameron (Isaac) and newcomer Vice Admiral Holdo (Dern) are left to rally the beleaguered troops. Elsewhere, having found Jedi Master Luke Skywalker (Hamill) in exile, Force strong Rey (Ridley) struggles to convince him to return to the battle for the galaxy. The depressed and lost Master is struggling to reconcile his failures in resurrecting the Jedi Order, and now questions the Jedi religion as a whole. Speaking of struggles, Kylo Ren is struggling to let the Dark Side consume him fully – with Snoke in his ear and Rey having a larger than expected effect on him, the conflicted ex-padawan (and filthy Han Solo murderer…) is desperate to find his place in the galaxy, just like Rey. Finn (Boyega) returns from his spine-slashing during The Force Awakens and buddies up with Resistance technician Rose (Tran) in order to infiltrate the First Order and give the Resistance a chance to simply survive, let alone win the fight – and with the shady DJ (del Toro) and murderess Captain Phasma (Christie) in the picture, nothing’s going to be simple. My first concern going into The Last Jedi is Star Wars movies without Han Solo tend to fall more on the side of average (Rogue One aside) and secondly, would this just be The Empire Strikes Back in a new hat? Thankfully, both of these concerns have been well and truly dashed. Are there similar beats? Of course, but there are similar beats to many other movies out there too – one criticism that cannot be levelled at The Last Jedi is that it’s a duplicate of Empire, in the same way that The Force Awakens riffed off the Original Trilogy pretty heavily. It’s also the longest Star Wars movie of the saga, leaving Johnson enough time to squeeze in as much story and beats as he possibly could, and for the vast majority of the time, it all works.  Compared to previous instalments, this movie certainly takes a lot more risks – in terms of the perceptions of the Jedi and the Force, visually it’s strikingly different, the non-standard narrative flow, character motivations, it feels a lot more ambitious than what’s come before (certainly since Empire) and it’s refreshing to see a new direction being taken. It’s fair to say that The Force Awakens was a more ‘fun’ movie, more of a crowd-pleasing movie, though The Last Jedi has plenty of levity attached to it throughout. Performance-wise, the level is staggeringly high for a franchise not always associated with high-class acting. After recent appearances in Kingsman and Brigsby Bear, Mark Hamill delivers the finest performance of his career as the embittered and exiled Jedi Master and Carrie Fisher (RIP) also hasn’t been better before. The returning cast – Ridley, Boyega, Driver - all show greater signs of maturity in their abilities and have grown significantly into their characters, whereas Oscar Isaac is generally always good. Of the newcomers, Kelly Marie Tran shines brightest as the technician thrust into the fight and bright lights of casino city Canto Bight and is highly endearing with her performance. Andy Serkis is bad-ass as Snoke. Period. Visually, the movie is beautiful to look at. Similar to The Force Awakens and Rogue One, this movie is jam-packed with stunning, memorable shots and some fantastic (as per usual) visual FX. The space battles pop with colour, fire and expansive wide shots of massive Star Destroyers/Dreadnaughts and the more meditative moments allow for greater nuance in cinematography. As a motion-capture creation (as opposed to a huge hologram), Supreme Leader Snoke looks unnervingly genuine here as Andy Serkis works his wonder once more. The sound design is also impressively handled, especially in the stranger moments within the movie – as is John Williams score which feels more accomplished this time around compared to The Force Awakens. In terms of story, The Last Jedi is full of twists and turns that will surprise and engage you in equal measures. Again, the vast majority hit their mark as intended, though a couple don’t quite connect as well as Johnson maybe intended (space floating, anyone? It’s not bad, it just looked slightly bizarre) – the heavier, emotional beats were delivered brilliantly, however. There’s no one moment that steals the movie a la “I am your Father”, and the revelations are sprinkled through and the major reveals are handled just right (especially within the third act). With so many plot points being covered it’s inevitable that some moments weren’t as compelling as others and the casino arc was probably the weakest moment in the movie, whilst still remaining a strong component. Some of the humour was ill-placed at times and could take viewers out of certain moments, but the vast majority is great. Also, the Porgs (have I mentioned them?) aren’t the new Ewoks, thankfully, and their small screentime is utilised just right. There are some great space battles and incredible fight scenes also, one especially that is a joy to watch – choreography-wise and the location create a rewarding action scene. Crucially, the stakes feel high as well, it doesn’t really ever feel guaranteed that the good guys will prevail – it certainly puts the war in Star Wars. The Last Jedi is certainly an adventure that will pull you this way and throw you that way but never ceases to be anything but Star Wars – as different as it is in comparison to the previous efforts, it stills retains the core essence of the saga. It certainly will prove to be divisive, but hey, so was The Empire Strikes Back when it was released way back when. Buckle up and get ready for a wild ride."
"Dec 13, 2018",POSITIVE," The themes of this film are layered and have multiple facets to them. One of them is to let the past die. This message goes for the film but also the audience. The Last Jedi respects its historic past, addresses the legends of it’s lore, and takes into account the events of the previous films but makes you think about them in a bold new way. Over the last two years, we’ve heard every fan theory, speculation and prediction possible for this film and Rian Johnson accomplishes to circumvent all of them and give the audience a film they weren’t expecting. The second the film picks up from where The Force Awakens leaves off, it instructs you to expect the unexpected. From Luke Skywalker’s demeanor and actions, to Rey and Kylo Ren’s arcs, everything is given room to breathe and isn’t spoon fed to force you into one particular way of thinking. What Rian Johnson did is challenge these characters and challenge the audience of their pre-conceived notion of these characters like any middle point of a trilofy should. Rian Johnson did not give us Empire Strikes Back 2.0. Instead, he took what made Empire special, it’s unpredictablity, and used it well for the middle point of this Trilogy. The characters all impressed in this film. This mostly extends to three characters above all. Luke Skywalker, Rey and Kylo Ren. All three were used well and serviced in a way that adds to the lore of Star Wars and history of these iconic characters. Mark Hamill’s performance as Luke is nothing short of spectacular. Starkly different from his joyful and unyeilding hopeful nature of the original trilogy, we meet Luke in a broken state. Haunted by the past and afraid of the present. While audiences might be wary of seeing an iconic character like Luke in this state, it is precisely why this characterization was so great. It was a challenge to the audience and a challenge to the character to find his way back to the light. Luke had an arc that impressed me and his legendary status in Star Wars lore has resounding development. Without spoiling, my favorite scene in the film was one involving him. Rey and Kylo, two sides of the same coin, are developed well in this film. Both go through a soul searching arc that arrived to an interesting and unexpected destination . Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are impressive and have developed right alongside their respective characters. Both moved significant steps in their respective arcs and I’m very excited to see where Abrams and Terrio take them for the final entry of this trilogy. Poe, Finn, Rose and BB-8 are all serviceable and did their required jobs in the story as secondary characters. While I felt the story thread with Finn and Rose in particular dragged a bit, it didn’t hinder the film much. Poe was developed well and is on a clear emotional arc in this film that will surly be developed and concluded in the final entry of this trilogy. Original Trilogy icons, Leia, Chewy, C-3PO and R2-D2 showed up in true form and Carrie Fisher’s Leia gave a resonant, powerful and emotional performance as the Princess/General. It was a bittersweet but inspiring to see her and she had some of the best moments of the film. R.I.P Rian Johnson filmed one of the most beautiful films in the Star Wars saga. Filled with impressive, striking and beautiful shots, The Last Jedi is a constant eye pleasing beauty, all backed behind John Willaims’ iconic and powerful score. Overall, The Last Jedi is great. It challenges the characters, challenges the audience and challenges the actors. In the end, it transforms into a film that will stand the test of time and rank right up with Empire Strikes Back and A New Hope. Rian Johnson has proved his potential with this franchise and I look forward to what he does with a clean slate trilogy. The Last Jedi is the best way to handle the middle point of the trilogy, where The Force Awakens is feel good and nostalgia filled start, The Last Jedi breaks new ground and moves the story in a bold direction that is healthy for the franchise. In short, The Last Jedi is a powerful, emotional and ambitious film that makes for one of the best films in the series."
"Dec 8, 2018",POSITIVE," Here we are again. For the third Christmas season straight, moviegoers have been treated to what once seemed unthinkable: more Star Wars. Last year, we were treated to the Gareth Edwards-directed Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, the “lost story” that told of how the Death Star came to be and of the Rebels who fought to find a way to destroy it. I reviewed that film for Geeks Under Grace, and love or hate the story, it undeniably allowed a trip back into the look and feel of the original films that hadn’t been done for decades. Two years ago, we picked up decades after the original trilogy ended with The Force Awakens (Episode VII, for those keeping count), directed by J.J. Abrams. Whereas Rogue One filled in gaps between the prequels and the original saga, The Force Awakens plotted the course of a new trilogy of films with both familiar and new characters in a tale that was also both familiar and new (how forgivable that sense of familiarity was depends on who you ask). In it, we found out the whereabouts of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2, and more, but we learn those things through a new tale focused on new characters like Rey, Finn, Poe, Kylo Ren, General Hux, Captain Phasma, Supreme Leader Snoke, and, lest we forget, BB-8. Seen by most critics as a fun return to the universe we love, it ended with many unanswered questions. Now, two years after that, we begin to get some answers from Episode VIII, directed by Rian Johnson. I’ll begin by saying that this film has no problem with bucking conventions. Reacting to the line we hear from Luke in the film, we can correctly infer that surprises are aplenty. With a fanbase locked and loaded with two years worth of theories and ideas of where things are headed, Rian Johnson iced most all of them down like a Hoth battle. And just when you think, “Oh wait! This film has a snow-covered Hoth battle too!”, he explicitly has it stated that the similar look is only that, and that it is all salt instead. I’m sure that salt will be a good descriptor of the reaction of many who have their feelings hurt after their theories are torn to shreds, but only time will tell. Anyway, I won’t delve into the plot, other than saying that all the primary players are pushed into new, more complicated directions. Trailers divulge that Rey (Daisy Ridley) seeks the tutelage of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), now embittered and in self-imposed exile for mistakes of the past. Those mistakes center around his past instruction of Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), himself now struggling further under the direction and expectations of Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). Finn (John Boyega) has recovered from his wounds, but after reviving, he is sent covertly by a desperate and disgruntled Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) with another Resistance enlistee, Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), to find a way to destroy the tracking mechanisms of the First Order. Without these systems disabled, the Resistance leadership, including General Leia (the late Carrie Fisher) and Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), will be effectively neutralized by the pursuing General Hux (Domnhall Gleeson) and company. While that may sound like too much information, please know that I withheld far more than that, and within those plot threads, many, many secrets will be answered and new questions will be posed. While The Force Awakens played very closely to what came before it, not just in look and feel but in actual storytelling elements, The Last Jedi is very refreshing for the saga. There was a boldness that came within those original films of fighting against conventional thought on what a sci-fi film could be. Here, we see that coming against what we think a Star Wars film can be. Does every new introduction land flawlessly? No, but that boldness to try is a great thing to see play out. One can tell that Rian Johnson is a true fan of it all, and knowing that he is now entrusted to tell a new set of tales in a future trilogy is an incredible thing to look forward to. I felt in this film that anything could happen, and in this age of spoilers, it’s quite the feeling. Do all you can to keep secrets just that, and enjoy this film on its own terms. Back to Johnson: he crafts shots and sequences that feel unique to what we expect of Star Wars. That will likely divide people, but no one can fault the beauty of it all. The “middle films”  tend to deal with some dark themes, and that does find its way into the look of the films as well; the same holds true in The Last Jedi. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous here, and whether it be a lingering shot or a frenetic action sequence (there are many of both extremes), it is all a moviegoing pleasure to witness. I watched the film in 3D, but I am certain that the richness and “pop” lies more in the choice and execution of shot-framing than it does in any post-production tweaking for the 3D-effect. We go to new locales here that feel truly special. The opulence of the space casino of Canto Bight, in particular, is like no place we’ve seen in a live-action Star Wars film. I can’t wait to revisit those scenes again and again. Crait, the red crystalline planet blanketed with white salts, provides the basis for contrast that has featured so heavily in the film’s marketing, and really, those colors extend into the themes handled here. As warfare ravages the surface, the white is disturbed to reveal the red, and it is effective symbolism like this that runs throughout. This is a film that will be watched again and again, as we expect of the saga, but I do believe that we will appreciate these touches more and more as time goes on. Now, watching the film again and again might prove to be a problem in ways for many. Up to its release, it was reported that this was the longest Star Wars film yet, and I have to say that it does feel like it as well. That’s really too bad, because long films don’t always fall victim to this. Had the film been engineered a little differently in ways, I believe that it all could have clipped a little better for audiences and avoided critique in this area. Still, I hesitate to say that because it would have likely truncated or eliminated some of the new characters in the film, each of whom, including the quirky slicer DJ (Benecio Del Toro), contribute important pieces to the tale being told. Even with the bloated runtime, this film, with all of its philosophical eccentricities and complicated motivations, really does have things to say. Alongside some other relevant messages, there is a central one of hope and heroism amidst dwindling circumstances that comes through strongly; sure, it is as on the nose here as it was in Rogue One, but it all does seem to be about inspiring some kind of social or societal outlook in ways that I haven’t seen before in any of the other films. Moreso than The Force Awakens, there are some bold new points made that will surely inform all the films following, and the Force, seemingly felt to be known and understood inside and out by the audience, is shown to be even more surprising than we ever realized. These elements will likely be divisive amongst fans, but all in all, it’s exciting to go along for the ride of it all. All of the primary actors returning from The Force Awakens step up their game here, and the new additions all do their part as well to make impressions alongside them. Ridley and Driver are becoming the center of it all, and each are making this new saga more and more interesting. Boyega and Tran develop a connection that is fun to see and follow. Isaac is such an able actor, and seeing him so desperate to lead and protect as Poe is great, knowing that the original intent for the character was to die early on after his introduction. Sadly, my favorite new character from The Force Awakens, Maz Kanata, is used so inconsequentially here that I would have rather not seen her at all. John Williams brings all the right musical cues here with his score, even if, like The Force Awakens, it isn’t all exactly groundbreaking. I do hope to hear him at least conclude this trilogy, but at this point, we won’t likely hear sounds that approach his earlier works’ quality and inventiveness. Content-wise, we get about what you would expect from prior installments: some mild language, intense sequences, moments of violence, chaotic warfare explosions, and death (mentioned or played out) throughout. That said, these are films made to inspire audiences, young and old, and amazingly, those qualities come to the forefront in this film in particular. It leaves us with exciting possibilities moving forward, especially as characters are played by actors and actresses of multiple ethnicities. For Christians in particular, though, I must say that some elements of the film may rub some of us wrong. The Jedi are referenced as a religion here, and while that inference is nothing new, it does invite critique to our belief system, as well as others. The film examines a questioning of ideals held throughout the ages, a deconstruction of what we know and hold dear. I believed this to be so long before release, and I even wrote a piece on it then when the first trailer hit. While this can open up some great faith-based discussions, post-screening, with believers and non-believers alike, be prepared that the film operates as critique and go from there. As always, people will draw out or read into this film lots of religious parallels, as is often the case with the Star Wars mythos. Still, the messages I highlighted earlier are good for our time, where many feel hopeless and inconsequential. All in all, I was entertained greatly by this film. It did feel long, but so many huge things occur that it all feels somehow justified. With the crazy things we see done by starpilots and Force users, now is as much of a time of discovery, as it is enjoyment. I, along with millions, eagerly await the continuation of the stories of these new characters, as they have taken their place as the primary players in this saga now. They are inspiring children of all ages now, just like the characters of past films have done before, and that’s an amazing legacy to see come about. I eagerly await J.J. Abrams‘ conclusion to this trilogy, knowing that Rian Johnson raised the bar even higher than what Abrams had set. Until then, I have a few more theater visits to plan and a Blu-Ray to preorder! Oh, and yes: Porgs are awesome."
"Nov 19, 2018",POSITIVE," Star Wars: The Last Jedi changes up the franchise formula. It’s longer than any of its predecessors and its uneven tone sometimes doesn’t fit the series itself. However, the excitement remains with a plot that works commendably well in moving this story in a different direction. In 2015, Star Wars: The Force Awakens ended on a cliffhanger. Literally. The film concluded with the idealistic Rey (Daisy Ridley) meeting the elusive Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). The latter character appeared only for a moment before the credits rolled, failing to utter a single word. The anticipation about his character’s evolution has only grown since then and The Last Jedi resolves that cliffhanger with unexpected results. It was inevitable that some fans would be disappointed with the follow-up installment of this series considering the build up to it. Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which featured some great new characters and a strong story, struck more of a familiar tone to long-term fans. In many ways, it was very similar to A New Hope which launched the franchise in 1977. The Last Jedi, which also introduces some great new characters, features some major twists that fans likely won’t expect. In that way, director Rian Johnson takes this series in a new direction while keeping with some of the well-known Star Wars story beats. Rey’s storyline, for instance, features her training under Skywalker (similar to how Skywalker trained with Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back). At the same time, she communicates secretly with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). The sequences featuring the duo communicating through the Force create an intriguing dynamic between them, showing the dichotomy between the good and bad sides of the force. Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), a new character here, has a solid storyline as well. One of the rebel leaders, she faces off against hotshot pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), who was introduced prominently in The Force Awakens. The introduction of Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) as a young rebel also adds a new hopeful tone to the story. In many of the individual stories though, there are tonal distractions that stand out as obvious miscues. An early scene featuring Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) after an attack feels like it was ripped from another film. Scenes featuring Luke surviving on his planet (and milking an animal) also has an effect of distracting the audience. These are moments that never fit nicely into their stories and feel unnecessarily silly. One of Johnson’s strengths here is also one of his weaknesses. It oftentimes feels like he doesn’t want to hew that closely to the stories that came before. A common and valid criticism of The Force Awakens was that many of its story points were reminiscent of ones from A New Hope. The Last Jedi avoids that criticism by surprising audiences, especially in the dramatic third act. The Last Jedi isn’t what you would expect in the Star Wars universe. Characters that once seemed domineering fall to the side. Concepts that were planted in The Force Awakens are short-changed. These elements are interesting because they show that this series won’t only go in expected directions. But not all of the choices that Johnson makes work. That’s why even though the story works well enough, this latest installment isn’t the home run that The Force Awakens was."
"Nov 15, 2018",NEGATIVE," The wait is over for Star Wars fans everywhere! As is tradition, join us for over an hour of our initial impressions of The Last Jedi, and stay tuned for part 2 dropping early next week!"
"Nov 13, 2018",POSITIVE," If J.J. Abrams’ The Force Awakens was an exercise in nostalgia, Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi is an experiment of expectancy. It pushes the boundaries of its characters, its audience, and the franchise’s capacity, upending our expectations even as it fulfills ones we never knew we had. There are new worlds, new characters, and important new questions both raised and answered. To put it simply, this is a hopeful film; it is moving into the future of Star Wars even as it honors the past. The Last Jedi picks up right where The Force Awakens left off, with ex-Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) recovering from his battle with the darkly unstable Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) as maverick Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and his Resistance fighters try to make their escape from the nefarious First Order. All this occurs as the intrepid Rey (Daisy Ridley) hands a lightsaber to Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in an attempt to bring him back to spark hope in the rebellion, even as she eagerly desires to learn the ways of the Force from the Jedi master-turned-hermit. For all its parallels to The Empire Strikes Back in structure, themes, and existential crises, The Last Jedi is the funniest of all the Star Wars films (not including the unintentionally funny Star Wars Holiday Special). It’s also the most narratively complex, with a cast of new significant characters, including Laura Dern as Resistance leader Admiral Amilyn Holdo and Kelly Marie Tran as Rose Tico, a Resistance mechanic who finds herself caught up with Finn in an eleventh-hour plot to save the Resistance from total destruction. A few of these narrative beats feel like they elongate the plot too much. One such sequence on a casino planet (think Mos Eisley meets Las Vegas), frankly, doesn’t affect the final outcome of the plot machinations, though it does provide for some humorous action sequences and character development. Still for all the narrative threads and various characters, Johnson has crafted a well-paced, thrilling Star Wars film filled with interesting characters and some rich ideas to explore. There are a number of surprises and twists here, ones which don’t feel hokey or a ploy, but which genuinely add to the development of key characters. It’s not only the characters who grow in their capacity–the mythology around the Force expands as well. At one point, Luke asks Rey what she really knows about the Force. Her answer, though innocent and simple, also proves her naïveté, and ours as the audience. The Force truly was awakened in Episode VII in ways we can finally experience, crossing the planes of time and space with a sense of purpose. Johnson utilizes the cinematic language to frame these Force awakenings, particularly in the editing and framing of characters in various conversations. The planetary environments are also unique and interesting, from the casino planet mentioned above to the red-and-white salt flats of a Rebel base. The cinematography is also rich and well-crafted; some shots still linger in my mind even now, and one actually made me gasp in the theatre at its brilliance in the midst of silence. With both visuals and sound–the John Williams score is as wonderful as ever here–The Last Jedi certainly leaves its impact. The Last Jedi also raises the question of politics, economics, and justice in ways previous Star Wars films haven’t broached as deeply. While the political procedurals about trade routes in Episode I are still painful in memory, the politics I’m speaking of here have to do with class structures, markets, and systems of power and oppression. We get to see just what the Resistance are resisting, and why the First Order might be “orderly” only for those who wield power through wealth and violence. We know why they’re rebelling, and we can see the impact when liberation occurs for those enslaved. Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) is more than a shadowy hologram; we see him in the flesh (albeit CGI flesh) sitting on an enormous throne with a long golden robe. These ostentatious signs of extravagance and greed, along with the First Order’s military quest for power and snuffing out any sense of a republic, and one doesn’t have to do much mental gymnastics to make the leap to present-day political realities. As one character quips, “It’s all just business.” In contrast to such notions, Johnson has crafted a sympathetic and affecting film, one which truly values and humanizes the characters (even the non-human ones). Did I mention BB-8? Or porgs? Or the other residents on Luke’s island? Or the lightsaber battles? Chewbacca? The Millennium Falcon? More porgs? They’re all here in The Last Jedi, and they’re wonderful. I haven’t delved into the film’s specific plot details, and I won’t for now, apart from one: Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa is far more present in The Last Jedi than I anticipated. With her tragic death nearly a year ago, and the ghastly CGI Leia in Rogue One, I was hesitant that her role would either be too brief, or CGI-infused. I can say that not only is Fisher a significant character here, but she gives a remarkable performance–to the last, she’s fully alive. Hamill is significant here too as Luke, and imbues the character with a weightiness and maturity not yet seen in Star Wars. I’d be hesitant to say its his best performance as Luke, but one could argue for it, and I wouldn’t disagree. Indeed, The Last Jedi is one of the better additions to the saga; in terms of form and direction, it’s the strongest since Empire Strikes Back. As a cinematic experiment of expectancy, it met, then far exceeded all my expectations."
"Nov 6, 2018",POSITIVE," Granted, you’ve probably never heard of the 44-year-old director unless you’re an ardent fan of his indie noir feature “Brick” or his time-traveling, action adventure “Looper.” But moviegoers everywhere are familiar with Johnson’s latest work, the long-awaited eighth episode in George Lucas’s space opera epic “Star Wars” series. “The Last Jedi” has brought in over $220 million domestically since it opened Thursday, making it the second highest grossing film on an opening weekend of all time behind 2015’s “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” It’s easy to nitpick such a broad, bombastic film series, but “The Last Jedi” seeks to please many masters, most of whom have widely varying opinions about what a “Star Wars” film should be. Some will say it’s too long, that it tries too hard to be humorous, that it isn’t funny enough, that there are too many characters or not enough of “insert your favorite character here.” Everyone is right, and yet everyone is wrong at the same time. More so than any other film franchise, “Star Wars” is a series widely open to interpretation. As moviegoers, we are allowed – and outright expected – to make each and every installment our own, that there is a place for all of us in the “Star Wars” universe. It’s the same notion that makes us question whether or not we like “The Last Jedi” because it isn’t what we dreamed it would be. And that’s okay. The eighth episode picks up right where “The Force Awakens” left off, with Leia and her Resistance fighters on the run from The First Order and emerging leader Rey seeking out a now mythical Luke Skywalker to turn the tide of the war. In what will be likely her final appearance on screen, Carrie Fisher gives a measured, layered performance as former princess turned rebel general Leia. The warmth and gravitas she’s able to bring to the role grounds “The Last Jedi” in a firm sense of place, giving Johnson’s film unanticipated but much appreciated emotional depth. The same can be said of Mark Hamill in his return as Luke Skywalker. Like Fisher, Hamill’s performance in the role gets better with age and his reluctant mentorship of Daisy Ridley’s Rey provides several of the film’s best moments. For as iconic of characters as Luke and Leia are, neither has been portrayed as carefully or with as much forethought than in “The Last Jedi.” The three main heroes from “The Force Awakens” – Ridley’s Rey, John Boyega’s Finn and Oscar Isaac’s Poe – all return for this installment and do solid work. However, pedestrian storylines for Boyega and Isaac leave the talented actors with little to work with and marginalized compared to Ridley, on whom the franchise has rightfully placed all their hopes. While Ridley does solid work as the young defender of the light side of the force, Rey’s dark side counterpart Kylo Ren proves to be more than formidable in the always steady hands of veteran character actor Adam Driver. Given more to work with in his second time as the heir apparent to Darth Vader, Driver does the best work of the entire film as the eternally conflicted, yet increasingly evil son of Leia and Han Solo. Johnson serves his film well by removing Kylo Ren’s Vader-inspired mask, allowing audiences to see the external and internal scars on Driver’s face. There’s so much rage in pain within Driver’s eyes; his complex performance leaps off the screen at every turn. While Ren projects strength and brash self-confidence, the conflict within betrays him. The nuance displayed by Driver, especially when paired against Ridley is stunning. It could very easily be the best cinematic villain since Heath Ledger’s sinister Joker in 2008’s “The Dark Knight.” Johnson’s film could rightly be accused of needing some extra time in the editing room. “The Last Jedi” races off in several directions all at the same time and ping-pongs back and forth between them at a frantic, haphazard pace. Many of Johnson’s unique visual choices, however, will soon go down as iconic moments in the history of the franchise, most notably a stunning battle sequence inside a First Order ship and the film’s climatic ending, which may leave viewers simultaneously in awe and in tears. It’s highly doubtful that “The Last Jedi” will make much of an impact come awards season, though this doesn’t mean at the latest Star Wars film isn’t a contender for one of the year’s ten best. In the hands of a decorated auteur like Johnson, “The Last Jedi” is proof positive that cinematic creativity in blockbuster filmmaking can enhance a film’s quality without jeopardizing the bottom line. Audiences will laugh, they’ll cry and they may even complain a little (or more realistically, a lot). But this isn’t to say that “Star Wars: Episode VIII” doesn’t deliver on the promise that “The Force Awakens” started."
"Nov 3, 2018",NEUTRAL," Synopsis: Rey (Daisy Ridley) attempts to convince Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to train her in the ways of the Jedi, while various Resistance fighters try to stay out of the clutches of the First Order. Review: Although not plumbing the anomalous depths of Rogue One, Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi (the eighth episode in the grand saga) is a serviceable Star Wars yarn at best, and, I’ve a strong hunch that when the hype dies down in the months and years to come, it won’t be viewed in the same league as the original Star Wars trilogy and possibly even its predecessor, The Force Awakens. One potential criticism that The Last Jedi by and large bypasses is in being overly manufactured as a direct homage to the original trilogy’s middle child, The Empire Strikes Back (just as The Force Awakens seemed a very canny repackaging of A New Hope). There are some visual motifs and pictorially similar scenes to The Empire Strikes Back, but they’re different enough, in a chronologically jumbled order, and completely inferior anyway, so comparison feels by the by. Where The Last Jedi suffers more is from its plotting and structure. It features at least one act too many, has a surplus of action sequences, and arguably loses its sense of denouement with that elongated feel. A problem that carries over from The Force Awakens and becomes more evident here is the sense that the villains, and villainy in general, have been weakly determined. It’s even betrayed by the way this trilogy’s plot arbitrarily accelerates the First Order into a position of complete dominance from the off. It’s an admission of a lack of confidence in suggesting the rise of the villains’ malevolent stranglehold, plus that the producers wanted a dialectic exactly like the Empire versus the Rebels from the original trilogy. Snoke is a terrible villain in visual conception and dramatic execution, and perhaps these issues with Snoke are inadvertently acknowledged by a surprise scene midway through the film. Also, Kylo Ren, though a good character in his own right and well incarnated by Adam Driver, is too aligned sentimentally to the Resistance from the get-go to have the same purely evil gravitas of Emperor Palpatine or Darth Vader – two characters or spirits that this trilogy sorely lacks. My final quibble would be that The Last Jedi‘s use of flashbacks and outright telepathic conversations feels like the sort of narrative cheating that the original trilogy would never have done in its similar moments of Jedi-mythic exposition, and the use of Yoda is particularly contrived and shallow here."
"Nov 1, 2018",POSITIVE," Star Wars is and always has been an underdog story. An action-packed intergalactic odyssey about small legions of rebels rising against seemingly insurmountable adversaries, Star Wars is rooted in an idea of hope against all odds, and you don’t need C3P0 on hand to butt in for that calculation. After the politically-charged prequels, The Force Awakens (and Rogue One) returned to this central conceit of a Sisyphusian struggle – toil in the face of utter improbability – depicting new characters taking their turn against a tyrannical empire, its limitless armada and impossibly supercharged firepower and with Star Wars: The Last Jedi, hope has never seemed so out of reach and victory so unachievable.  Starting back on the cliff that J.J. Abrams hung his last shot (in the most on-the-nose cliffhanger of the century), The Last Jedi picks up exactly where The Force Awakens left off. The new-fangled core trio of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Fin (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) are as splintered as its legacy characters, of whom Han is now no more. As Fin recovers from battle wounds sustained in the prior chapter, Poe finds himself back in the cockpit proving his title as the “Rebellion’s best pilot” but taking unnecessary risks for the sake of macho heroics, think Luke running his T-16 down Beggar’s Canyon chipping at romp rats, much to General Leia Organa’s (Carrie Fischer) chagrin. Meanwhile Rey tries to convince a cantankerous and unwilling Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to give her some much needed training in the ways of the Force so that she can face down Sith patricide Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). While The Last Jedi isn’t a mirror image of The Empire Strikes Back in the same way that The Force Awakens was to A New Hope, there are intentional parallels between the sophomoric chapters in these respective trilogies. With Rey training with a reclusive Jedi master on a largely abandoned planet and our other heroes on the run from the Empire’s imposing star fleet, the similarities are obvious. Fortunately, writer/director Rian Johnson (Looper, Brick) exploits our expectations as often as he can, feeding an also decidedly on-the-nose narrative about destroying the past to make way for the new. Though dynamics look similar, beneath the surface Rian is often busy turning the norm on its head and here The Last Jedi succeeds. We see glorious plans end in failure, great hopes dashed and familial reveals that can be painful for all the wrong reasons. Unfortunately, The Last Jedi has almost as much Attack of the Clones as it does The Empire Strikes Back in that it’s overlong, under-edited and has at least one particularly long-winded CGI flurry of a sequence that harkens back to the darkest days of the franchise. There’s no whining about sand getting everywhere and the acting is really strong across the board (Hamill is particularly great back in Jedi robes, ham and all) but The Last Jedi could definitely have used a second editorial pass. More than one character is treated to a subplot that amounts to nothing more than a drawn-out red herring, with a copious amount of wasted time invested in easily edited-out dead ends. A scene in an opulent casino is easily the most painful yet in this new generation of Star Wars flicks, eliciting images of the green screen busy set pieces of the early-2000 franchise additions, enticing to the youngest members of the audience who need their stories overly padded with shiny spectacle. There are a handful of new characters, including scoundrel code breaker/Lando-stand-in DJ (Benicio del Toro), Laura Dern’s headstrong Vice Admiral Holdo and the low-ranking but high-spirited Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), who makes the biggest impression of the new arrivals, embodying the youthful glimmer of hope and rebellious spirit that once characterized a young Luke. Even at over two-and-a-half-hours, The Last Jedi doesn’t have the room to do all of its characters justice, with some internal transformations happening in a slapdash manner at plot convenience light speed. The further stretching of the character stable comes at the expense of others, usually on the villain side of the equation, notably the pock-marked, pink-faced Raisinette Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), Domhnall Gleeson‘s puckered, snarling and shouty General Hux and chromed-out bureacrat Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) all of whose potential is again left wholly unrealized. Driver’s Kylo Ren becomes an even more complicated character but even his true intentions remain a bit hazy and impossible to parse when all is said and done. Unlike previous installments, The Last Jedi splits from its predecessors in taking a decidedly more nuanced approach to good and evil. In the feature film continuity, the Jedi and the Sith stand as polar opposites, the later being a tempestuous pull towards absolute power, but The Last Jedi further erodes the wall behind the two sides and brings to light the inherently problematic nature of the Jedi order standing as some kind of moral superior. Luke goes so far as to call the notion of good and bad merely words. Questioning ethical supremacy in interesting and thoughtful ways that have only been hinted at in past installments but never to this level, Johnson proves more interested in the grey area than the stark light and darkness. The exact divide that the Jedi would like to prescribe to the breakdown between their kind and the Sith. Morally ambiguity defines critical moments in The Last Jedi, which makes for exciting and totally unexpected turns of tide, but also draws characters to make shocking decisions that don’t necessarily hold up upon closer scrutiny. There are a handful of gotcha moments peppered through The Last Jedi that I wouldn’t dare reveal here. And though they make for huge, audible gasps in the moment, some left me wondering if they weren’t cheap solutions that only partially make sense in terms of character motivation. A bond between two unlikely characters becomes the focal point of the moral ambiguity though the way that it’s ultimately resolved left me cold and unsatisfied, as if Johnson had written himself into and out of a corner by the skin of his teeth and then just left it to hang like a recently limbless Luke dangling with little hope of rescue below. Though Johnson tries to reach the emotional pinnacle of Kylo betraying and killing father Han, he just can’t manage the same goosebumps-inducing heights of the best moments in The Force Awakens, much less the most iconic reveals among the franchise’s greatest hits. Thinking back on The Last Jedi less than 24 hours later, there are really only a handful of scenes that stand out to me, some glaring and unnecessary, others wowing and extraordinary. The new cast is generally more developed – it’s nice to see Isaac get a much bigger character arc, Rey remains a standout and Fin finds something to believe in – and fan service is kept at a manageable level but all and all, The Last Jedi only has a handful of epic moments and they’re not enough to overlook its many shortcomings. Yes, John William‘s score is powerful as a hug from a Wookie  and the special effects are as stunning as hologram chess for the most part (an apt blend of practical and digital) but outside of the cold open, I don’t think anything really punched me in the gut the way that it was meant to. Like bantha fodder riddled with kyber crystals, The Last Jedi is a jumble of really good and kinda bad, with some rather harebrained plot holes and a saddle-bagged second act that keeps it well outside the upper tier of Star Wars offerings for me. Expectations are a bitch and even though I tried to keep mine in check, I couldn’t help but expect more from a Rian Johnson-directed Star Wars movie. J.J. Abrams, for his film’s many faults, teed up what could have been a doozy of a sequel and though The Last Jedi is by many accounts a fine addition, one with no shortage of laughs, a bundle of warm fuzzies (the divisive Porgs are as adorbz as the Ewoks without being anywhere near as narratively intrusive) and ooh’s and aah’s that moves the story forward in some genuinely compelling ways, I can’t help but express my genuine disappointment in the overall product. But Star Wars is an underdog story, Disney overlords or not, so I’ll always be there rooting for it to turn towards clearer seas.

"Oct 31, 2018",POSITIVE," 2015’s long-awaited return to the galactic delights of the world of the light and the dark evoked a sense of unparalleled euphoria akin to no other cinematic experience. A nostalgia machine it may be, but The Force Awakens was exactly what the Star Wars franchise needed – a loving nod and reminder of why we still look to the stars 40 years after the first entry in the series. The main criticism of Episode VII was its glaring similarities to A New Hope‘s plot – a sweeping statement but fair all the same. However, first time Star Wars director Rian Johnson is clearly one with the force, as his bold, fresh and ingenious ideas shine through this exceedingly better powerhouse blockbuster. With the nefarious First Order tightening their grip across the Galaxy, Rey (Daisy Ridley) desperately tries to learn the ways of the Jedi under the hesitant tutelage of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). While Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), under the forceful command Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), seeks vengeance against Rey and the Resistance, Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Leia (Carrie Fisher) must work to prevent their obliteration. Immediately following from The Force Awakens, Johnson demands your allegiance to the franchise, in the sense that your hyperdrive should be primed to jump straight back in. Episode VII left us on an island with Rey and Luke, the latter forlornly staring at his former saber. The resolution of this moment is delightfully unexpected, ringing true to the quote from the trailer: “This is not going to go the way you think”. This could be applied to the entire feature, as from the get-go we’re thrown into a cataclysmic, explosive space battle with an iconic dreadnought, which emphasises the Wars in the title in haunting fashion. From here it’s an unpredictable, emotional jump to light speed. The set-pieces throughout are elegant, extravagant and exquisitely shot. The lightsaber battles are kinetic and glorious to the eye, Johnson showing a keener aptitude for creating an epic bout, utilising both extreme crystal-lit close ups and wide, full body shots. Despite the problems with George Lucas’ sacred prequels, it’s a throwback to the exhilarating saber battles in those entries, such as the legendary Darth Maul’s. It’s not bloody, but it’s beautifully violent. You feel the sizzle of every saber slash, sometimes decapitating the opponent which brings out a joyous “Ohhh” in the audience. Any sequence in Snoke’s lair is a captivating red dreamscape that wouldn’t be out of place in a Winding-Refn picture – the bravery in Johnson’s direction paying off in huge dividends through each scene, whether it provokes intrigue or a smacked gob. The anticipated, proper return of Hamill as the infamous Jedi is a remarkable feat. Johnson takes the character in a surprising direction, which in turns brings out a fantastic performance from Hamill. The Force Awakens‘ use of Han Solo fuelled romantic memories, but The Last Jedi‘s use of Skywalker is more similar to Blade Runner 2049‘s use of Deckard Shaw – he’s central to the narrative, with a few little nods here and there, but mostly a beloved character whose tortured past is never in doubt. Driver’s villainous Kylo is developed far further, surely becoming one of the finest foes in the series. His performance perfectly captures his inner conflict, the pull of the light and the uncontrollable rage of the dark, leading to some unforgettable displays of emotion from the terrific actor. When it comes to Snoke, the less said the better – not because he’s bad, but his presence is menacingly significant, radiating terrifying power immediately. Johnson tackles a lot of narrative throughout the 152 minute runtime (the longest Star Wars movie ever – yeeha). Rey and Luke’s relationship is a gripping focal point, as is a new dynamic between her and Kylo. The plight of the rebels glows with hope, with Isaac playing a far deeper role this time round and turning into a firm leader. It’s also a fitting tribute to the late Carrie Fisher, whose inclusion here is mostly well executed. Boyega is a loveable hero, and her new compadre Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) is a nice addition. However, as much as it isn’t overbearing, their entire sub-plot is when the adventure loses steam. This moves the film away from where all the interest is – Luke. At this point, it becomes a little disjointed and unnecessary, never reaching a point of excitement required for a chunk of plot of this degree. After this half hour passes, and you desperately try to forget a momentously nonsensical Leia scene, The Last Jedi flies into perhaps the finest final hour in Star Wars history. As much as it may be wonderfully different from the franchise norms, it still feels unequivocally and truly Star Wars. Johnson gets it – whether it is through the both comedic and thrilling return of the charming BB-8, the excruciating cuteness of the Porgs, or the visually poetic red dust from the salt landscape – it’s all an absolute treat, wrapped up in a very tight package which gives nothing away for Episode IX."
"Oct 31, 2018",POSITIVE," There’s one line in the film, “Let the past die,” that defines The Last Jedi’s internal struggle. One could look at that as a fairly ironic utterance considering The Force Awakens was essentially a remake of A New Hope and that Disney’s Star Wars seems quite poised to never die, but there is a sense of truth in this character’s statement. As the franchise tries to figure out its identity in a post-George Lucas world, Star Wars may look to its roots for narrative inspiration, but it isn’t quite sure what course to plot for its characters. The Last Jedi does not have much of a plot. Without diving into too much detail, the main conflict between The Resistance and The First Order bears more resemblance to O.J. Simpson’s slow-speed car chase than the asteroid field that Han & friends had to navigate through in Empire Strikes Back. Rey’s visit to Luke’s island Dagobah fairs much better, but there’s still lingering questions as to what exactly happened to the world post-Yub Nub that is never really answered. I initially faced pushback for being critical of The Force Awakens’ lack of plot explanation from people who suggested that the film already bore the unenviable task of “resetting” the franchise after the prequels, and couldn’t be bogged down with too much exposition. Supreme Leader Snoke can be added to the list of things that are literally never explained. The audience is never once told who this man is or how he came into power, and yet the film goes on as if viewers should be expected to fear a villain who serves as little more than a cardboard cutout version of Emperor Palpatine. Darth Vader is one of the most menacing villains in cinematic history. While Emperor Palpatine’s Machiavellian mechanics were largely saved for the prequels, Return of the Jedi Palpatine had the luxury of existing in a Star Wars world where the Empire was the only “big bad” in town. The Last Jedi is the eighth movie in the main series and yet it doesn’t really have a single compelling villain. Kylo Ren is neither scary nor convincingly evil, Captain Phasma is the most useless character in the new trilogy, and Snoke is barely anything at all. Part of the problem is that The Last Jedi has a lot of characters, but it never really seems all that concerned about doing anything with any of them. Original trilogy characters are used as little more than window dressings, which I’d be more okay with if this new trilogy had big plans for its new leads. Director Rian Johnson has commented publicly on how this is Rey’s hero story, not Luke’s, but this trilogy has never really been able to answer the question of what this story is supposed to be. The basic questions that some people don’t think need to be answered in The Force Awakens carry a lot more weight if this next film is the conclusion of this newer story. It seems very possible that this new incarnation of Star Wars could end before the audience was ever given a reason to care. We live in a world where big franchises are always playing for the next movie. The Last Jedi forgets to live in the present. Audience members may identify more with the suave Han Solo or the powerful Leia Organa more than the whiny kid from Tatooine, but the original Star Wars trilogy belongs to Luke Skywalker. This new trilogy does not make Rey the focal point in quite the same way, but its reluctance to commit to its new heroes forces one to question how old icons like Luke and Leia were deployed to serve the film’s purpose. Carrie Fisher delivers an emotionally satisfying send-off in her final role, but Luke’s place in all of this is still treated in a fashion that “it’s not his story” never really satisfies. Some people waited thirty years to see this character on a screen again. Rian Johnson tosses this notion aside without fully considering how fans might react in the absence of an alternative nucleus. As someone who grew up a Star Wars fanatic, who bought a Sega 32X just to play Star Wars Arcade and wrote poetry about Chewbacca not getting a medal after the Battle of Yavin, I’m increasingly okay with the fact that this Disney version of Star Wars isn’t ever going to be the thing fans spent decades speculating about. Rogue One served as the benchmark for how to enjoy a movie in a franchise I used to obsess about. I won’t be buying the expanded universe novels, or eulogizing them should Disney ever decide to retcon them again. These are movies. Sometimes, that’s enough. Despite this fairly harsh assessment, I did enjoy The Last Jedi. I had fun sitting in a movie theatre for two and a half hours while some explosions happened and some people did some things, a low bar that Star Wars can’t help but hit. When Solo: A Star Wars Movie comes out, I’ll go and see it. I’ll write my review, if only to reflect on the time in my life when this franchise meant something to me. I’m not the person who needed every single incarnation of Han Solo action figure and Star Wars isn’t the franchise that spurs debate over the ethics of blowing up the second Death Star. The person in me who still puts Boba Fett in my mother’s terrarium can still enjoy the franchise that still has a place for R2-D2. I like that there are new Star Wars movies being told, even if I’ll spend my review point out the very legitimate issues. As C-3PO might say, wonderful! Five year Estradiol Illusions anniversary! Ian talks about what she’s been up to this year, mostly writing and trying to get over yet another breakup. Life is a tricky game. Best to keep a stiff upper lip and get on with things. Thank you to everyone who’s listened to the show over the past half-decade! We don’t do as many new episodes as we used to, but it’s always fun to catch up. "
"Oct 31, 2018",POSITIVE," Star Wars is back and it’s probably not going away any time soon. As much as both The Force Awakens and Rogue One have received praise for recapturing the magic of the original trilogy in ways the prequels never managed, they have also been criticized for relying too much on nostalgia instead of carving out their own identity. As a result of this, The Last Jedi has an incredibly fine line to tread on; it has to move the franchise forward whilst maintaining that classic Star Wars feel. The final result is probably not the movie you wanted, but one that makes you realise what you wanted probably wasn’t the best idea. Picking up right where The Force Awakens left off, The Last Jedi wastes no time in getting the ball rolling on an extended but exhilarating and tightly paced adventure. Despite being the longest film in the franchise to date and filled with plenty of emotional character moments, the film never feels like it comes to a complete halt. Much like The Empire Strikes Back, the film follows a multi-strand narrative with our heroes off on separate adventures, but all the storylines parallel and converge with each other much more smoothly; they compliment each other in a way that makes the narrative feel more cohesive. The second act is perhaps stretched a little too far, especially in regards to Finn and Rose’s storyline, but the movie knows when to cut away and progress another story when things start to drag. But what really makes The Last Jedi stand out is how it plays with the core tenants of the Star Wars franchise, making strong use of canon and nostalgia but twisting it to its own means rather than just making cute references. It lovingly questions what fans know and have come to expect, making it the first film in the franchise since Return of the Jedi where I genuinely didn’t know where it was going. You could almost say it’s intentionally unsatisfying in how it plays with your expectations, but what it delivers in return is superior upon reflection and is ultimately what you really came for: Star Wars for a new generation. Though some get more focus than others, every major character in The Last Jedi gets a moment to shine and the entire cast puts in everything they have throughout. Daisy Ridley gets ample room to explore the character of Rey, giving her an internal conflict far more intricate than any previous Star Wars protagonist and dissuading those Mary Sue arguments that erupted from The Force Awakens. John Boyega continues to excel as Finn, and pairing him with newcomer Kelly Marie Tran as Rose Tico makes for a sweet new double act. Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron is given a more important role here and the character now feels fully fleshed out, with a character arc unique to the franchise so far and promises that Poe will continue to be a key player throughout. Adam Driver really gets to sink his teeth into Kylo Ren, proving himself to be easily the most complex villain in the franchise thus far; not necessarily the most imposing or badass, but that vulnerability is what makes him so fascinating. The Last Jedi looks and feels like a classic Star Wars movie, but Rian Johnson more than injects his own unique flavour into it. The film offers far more new elements from a design perspective than its predecessor with unique planets, new ship and creature designs, and other aesthetics that feel fresh but still very much within the Star Wars brand. The film’s cinematography moves and breathes on a different wavelength to previous films, bathing the visuals with richer colours and playing with the camera work in a more modern but controlled way. The sound design is absolutely fantastic, using and revitalising classics sounds from across the saga whilst also creating new ones that slot perfectly into the canon. John Williams’ score this time around reuses a lot more themes from the previous films, but they all have a new edge to them and all the new tunes are more memorable for the most part than his compositions for The Force Awakens. Star Wars: The Last Jedi does what no film in the franchise has done in 34 years: it genuinely surprised me. The film breaks many franchise traditions on all levels, but it does so with a lot of respect and with the ambition to build something new and exciting from what remains. It really is the Empire Strikes Back of this new trilogy, but not in the same way The Force Awakens was essentially A New Hope. It is structurally and tonally similar to that movie, but the meat of it is wholly new material to the franchise. It’s certainly the best film in the saga since Empire, and perhaps with time it may even surpass it. Rian Johnson sets a new precedent for what you can do with a mainline Star Wars film, one I fear JJ Abrams won’t live up to in the next instalment, but I’m excited for it all the same simply because we are now moving into uncharted territory. The franchise no longer feels burdened by the traditions of the past and, in a sense, now feels truly reborn."
"Oct 31, 2018",NEUTRAL,"If Awakens was about The Resistance and The First Order repeating the cycle of The Rebellion and The Empire, this one is all about how they have to become their own things and what the proper way to get there is going to be - and that's exciting."
"Oct 31, 2018",NEGATIVE," With Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the most signficant franchise in popular culture awoke from a deep slumber. However, it did so with a sense of familiarity that, while perhaps necessary, hurts the film in hindsight.  But Star Wars: The Last Jedi takes another necessary step, that of subversion of the very things that The Force Awakens hinged on. And in doing so, The Last Jedi breathes urgent purpose into the new trilogy, purpose it had yet to prove. What’s immediately evident about The Last Jedi — through a nailbiter of an opening sequence, which includes an absolutely hysterical bit that tops Poe’s opening of “who talks first?” in The Force Awakens — is that this film is interested in people. While some large scale action films focus on the spectacle, writer-director Rian Johnson and cinematographer Steve Yedlin’s camera situates us with the fighting, the sacrificing and the dying that fuel those battles.  When it comes to his focus on our main characters, Johnson succeeds in giving them all heavy, deeply personal character arcs. Finn needs to learn how best to fight for the Resistance. Poe needs to learn leadership that thinks ahead of the enemy, that thinks of everyone that a potential failure in leadership might affect. And John Boyega and Oscar Isaac inject the same kind of charismatic vigor into their characters that made them so lovable in the first place. But Johnson’s portrayal of Luke Skywalker, this mammoth figure in pop culture, is the film’s most dynamic feature. And that’s because Johnson takes him out of the familiar, out of what we know him to be. Essentially, Johnson dissects “the legend” of Luke Skywalker, questioning that title by focusing in on Kylo Ren’s turn to the dark side years prior while at Luke’s Jedi school. It gives Mark Hamill new space to explore, as a rehash of pure heroism would’ve failed to be profound, and Hamill offers up a hilarious, pained, tired and tender performance. Though the trilogy jumps decades, we still get to feel the weight of those decades because Hamill bares it tangibly and beautifully. Johnson intertwines Luke’s arc with those of Rey and Kylo in a way that challenges Rey’s almost original-trilogy-Luke sense of purpose, and in a way that cuts straight to the heart of Kylo’s light-dark conflict. It’s a brilliant framework, as the film adds new layers to Kylo, not only in the context of his turn but in the context of his purpose moving forward. Adam Driver ingrains those emotions deep into his performance, rendering him as one of the more complex villains in large scale cinema.  The framework also places Rey at the forefront, mainly through her search for identity now that she’s been thrust into the world of the Force. The film’s answer is decidedly feminist, fitting into Johnson’s overall idea of who heroes are, and Daisy Ridley capitalizes on the material, delivering a performance that is, appropriately, searching, yet also gripping in its painful anger and raw vulnerability. The film is truly an ensemble piece, even more so than most typical ensembles as there’s a sense of individualized growth within nearly every character. And the performances of the rest of the cast are wholly committed, including vibrant work by newcomer Kelly Marie Tran, a towering presence from Laura Dern and a brave turn by the late Carrie Fisher.  This is, however, where the film slightly falters, as it becomes, at times, too stuffed with so much character work happening at the same time and in different places, which impacts the film’s pacing. Certain moments, such as when the plot needs to catch up, happen too quickly or conveniently and other moments, such as those of thematic significance, feel a bit too drawn out. The film also has four acts, which is not unusual, but it requires an extremely careful sense of flow and progression, perhaps exemplified by The Dark Knight. And while the flow from the third act into the fourth isn’t terrible, it’s unbalanced. But the film, despite its flaws, is genuinely stunning. Johnson choreographs action — both in space and on the ground — with such rhythmic intensity and fluidity, but also with an underlying grit informed by the film’s humanism. And the settings within which that action takes place are so singular and transfixing, often due to Rick Heinrich’s spellbinding production design and Steve Yedlin’s soaring and awe-striking cinematography, especially in his long shots.  The story, while not perfectly executed, also holds beauty. As said before, this film is about people. And Johnson engages with the political, shedding light on the First Order’s impact on the poor and forgotten, on those that come from nothing but a little bit of hope. Fascinatingly enough, however, Johnson, while portraying the Resistance lovingly, doesn’t shy away from critiquing the larger notion of the “machine” of the Resistance.  But it’s those like Rose Tico (Marie Tran), someone who works alone in the dirty underbelly of a Resistance ship and is not really a part of any “machine,” who can embody a heroism in the face of tyranny that leaders of the Resistance have yet to fully understand. It’s heroes like Rey who can represent the greatest that hope can stand for. In that sense, The Last Jedi is a new kind of Star Wars story. Along the way, the film challenges a lot of what we’re familiar with, especially in regard to the mythology of the universe. At points, the film almost feels satirical in how it critiques what we expect a Star Wars film to be.  Therein lies the film’s value. More of the same, especially in a wasteland of traditional, unengaging hero stories, would’ve been a shame. It was necessary for The Force Awakens, for that film to care about what we thought of it. "
"Oct 31, 2018",POSITIVE,"More than merely a continuation, The Last Jedi is in many ways an ending to the Star Wars we've known. And like many endings, it's anarchic and frustrating and poignant."
"Oct 30, 2018",POSITIVE," After a couple of years of growing anticipation and rampant speculation, Rian Johnson’s highly hyped installment of the brand new Star Wars trilogy comes to the screen in Star Wars: The Last Jedi. The sequel is a whole lot of movie, with a number of shocking moments interspersed between a lively and sometimes moving space adventure that builds upon George Lucas’ modern mythology while forging its own path for that galaxy far, far away. Whereas The Force Awakens leaned heavily on nostalgia with a story structure that mirrored the original Star Wars, The Last Jedi sets its own distinct tone and structure that makes it entirely its own thing. Just to be clear, I’m not going to give away any of the major revelations that occur within The Last Jedi. If it’s included in this review, you can rest assured, dear reader, that it is not anything that will affect your enjoyment of Rian Johnson’s thrilling spectacle. In The Last Jedi, The Resistance is struggling to survive as the nefarious First Order led by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) is preparing a deadly offensive that could lay waste the band of rebels. Snoke orders General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) to carry out the offensive while lambasting his Sith apprentice Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), basically negging the young villain in order to better manipulate him. The Resistance is given a chance when ace pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) leads a daring counter assault, but the ensuing loss of Resistance ships and pilots leaves the struggling rebels in a perilous situation. With the First Order tracking the ragtag Resistance fleet across the universe, there are few options for our heroes in order to survive. The losses from the counterattack leave General Leia (Carrie Fisher) no other option but to demote her ace pilot, and later he will butt heads with Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern). In order to stop the First Order’s tracking of the Resistance fleet, Poe dispatches Finn (John Boyega) and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), a young and eager mechanic, to travel to a distant planet and secure a codebreaker who can help the Resistance free themselves from the shadow of the First Order. Elsewhere, Rey (Daisy Ridley) has discovered the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), though the once-legendary Jedi is disinterested in the ways of The Force. Rey is attempting to pressure Luke to come out of hiding and aid the Resistance in their fight against oppression, but the Master Jedi has no interests, as he’s haunted by the horrible events that led to the creation of Kylo Ren. As Rey learns more of The Force, her raw power frightens Luke who sees the parallels between her and his nephew, and those fears grow as Rey and Kylo interact with one another. Of course, all these characters in different corners of the universe will find themselves colliding. Rian Johnson wastes no time in establishing the tone that he’s going to use for The Last Jedi. The film opens with a sequence that is humorous in parts and absolutely thrilling visually, providing us with a stunning star fight between the forces of good and evil. What stands out about The Last Jedi is the way in which the film feels truly epic yet its story retains a certain intimacy. The Last Jedi takes us to new worlds within the Star Wars universe that are fresh and lively, rarely if ever mirroring places we’ve been before over the course of the previous eight films. But the story is really contained; keeping the Resistance fighters on the run while Rey and Luke examine the nature of The Force. As much as we see old faces from Star Wars past, the film never relies on nostalgia to make these moments work. It creates new scenarios and conflicts that they must confront. And the new characters continue to leave a lasting impression. Rose is a welcome addition to the sprawling cast, and Kelly Marie Tran gets some of the film’s most moving moments. Poe, Rey, and Finn are all added layers of complexity to their characters as they progress forward. Once again, Kylo Ren continues to be the best Star Wars villain in the series history, a character of uncontrolled rage amidst and ongoing internal conflict. The characters go through significant changes over the course of the film. They’re challenged and pushed into unexpected directions. And then there are the delightful Porgs and BB-8 expands his skillset as a fantastic droid full of personality. It’s important, though, to avoid any and all spoilers for The Last Jedi. Rian Johnson takes the story in a number of unexpected directions, often with jaw-dropping results. So much of what occurs in the film carries great weight for the present and future of the series. Whatever the future holds for Star Wars, The Last Jedi will leave a lasting mark on this legendary series with numerous moments that are shocking and powerful with just enough humor to cut the tension. Rarely, if ever, does anything in The Last Jedi feel predictable. If J.J. Abrams set the table, Rian Johnson has delivered the feast. Now it’s up to J.J. to return to this series and deliver the dessert. After such a satisfying meal as The Last Jedi, J.J. Abrams has got a lot of work to do satisfy the appetite of Star Wars fans. An absolutely spectacular entry in the Star Wars saga, Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi delivers a thrilling experience full of eye-popping action, moments of levity, and shocking moments that will have people talking for years to come. This here writing represents a symbol of Sean Mulvihill's individuality, and his belief in personal freedom. He's also a hack writer who drinks too much and falls in love with girls."
"Oct 30, 2018",NEGATIVE," If you were among the fans who thought ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" was little more than a rehash of ""A New Hope,"" then ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" is the movie you've been waiting two years for. It's tough to rank it among other ""Star Wars"" movies just yet, but it's safe to say ""The Last Jedi"" is one of the best ""Star Wars"" movies ever made. It's right up there with ""Empire Strikes Back."" From the moment the Lucasfilm logo pops on screen and the John Williams’ score roars to life, it’s two-and-a-half hours of pure bliss to a galaxy far, far away. There is so much to love about ""The Last Jedi,"" it’s difficult to know where to start without giving too much away. The most important thing I can emphasize is that you should most certainly go into this movie knowing as little as possible about it. Director Rian Johnson does such a good job avoiding the sequel trap by taking the film in directions you don’t expect. If you think you have ""TLJ"" figured out, you’ll be sorely mistaken. There are several moments throughout the film where you’ll be sitting in your seat, your heart in your chest, completely unsure of what will happen next, and maybe that’s why Lucasfilm invited him back to direct his own standalone trilogy. There are also plenty of surprises I won't spoil here. There’s one device Johnson uses to great effect. He masterfully juxtaposes big, loud space sequences and fight scenes with unexpected moments of silence. These are best utilized when highlighting emotional, tender moments. The visual effects team and cinematographers really show off what they can do with the creation of two new worlds. The salt flats of Bolivia lend themselves to a gorgeous fight on Crait, a world that has a red mineral lying just below the surface. The film really outdid itself with the Casino city of Canto Bight which almost serves as an excuse to show off Lucasfilm’s workshop of “Star Wars” creatures in a fancy cantina-like setting. One of the best things about “The Last Jedi” is that when you think it’s going to be over, it keeps going. I thought the film was nearing its end once or twice and was happily surprised that there was about another half hour to go. You usually don’t feel that way during a big movie. The entire cast is wonderful, but it's Mark Hamill’s return as the troubled and haunted Jedi Master Luke Skywalker fans will rejoice over. Hamill's Skywalker is equally funny and cryptic with a secret of his own. Without giving much away, there is a very giffable Skywalker eye wink in the movie that I can’t wait to see hit the internet after its home release. Young girls who fell in love with Daisy Ridley’s Rey in “Episode VII,” will no doubt be styling their hair in three buns to match the spunky and eager Force sensitive woman. This is a character who feels as cemented in “Star Wars” lore as Luke at this point and she has rightly earned her place. If you’re not here for Luke and Rey, you’re certainly here to see Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa on screen once more. Every scene with Fisher feels like it was made with extra care. If Kylo Ren wasn’t one of your favorite characters in “The Force Awakens,” he may be now. Adam Driver continues to deliver a complex and conflicted antihero who just doesn’t want to be alone in the universe. We finally get face time with the mysterious Supreme Leader Snoke and he feels as menacing as Emperor Palpatine in “Return of the Jedi” even if the villains' true motivations aren’t quite clear. I’m not sure when Domhnall Gleeson’s General Hux was reduced into a hilarious punching bag, but it works here and is fantastic every time he comes on screen. Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron delivers some of the film’s other biggest laughs as the Resistance’s fiery fighter pilot. Kelly Marie Tran’s new character Rose will give young girls another hero to look up to alongside Rey. And Benicio del Toro enters the fray as a delightfully wonky side character. A lot of the legacy characters — Chewbacca, R2-D2, and C-3P0 — are in the film too, but they feel like they’re just there for nostalgia’s sake. Most take a back seat to make way for new favorites like BB-8. “The Last Jedi” makes sure to get in enough scenes of its most bankable new droid even if his appearance doesn’t quite make sense. The cute penguin-like creatures called Porgs get more screen time than C-3P0 and you know it’s a push to sell all of those adorable stuffed animals. You win on this one, Disney. Keep your eyes peeled for star power. You may do a double take in a casino scene and wonder if you just saw “The Leftovers” star Justin Theroux. Yes, yes you did. Underneath all of the star power and fight scenes, “The Last Jedi” sends a message we need more than ever, one of hope. “We’re going to win not by fighting what we hate, but saving what we love” is a line said late in the film that feels pretty applicable in the scope of 2017. After you get past the excitement of being reunited with Hamill and Fisher and after the thrill of seeing another “Star Wars” movie die down, you’ll be hit with a realization. For as good as “The Last Jedi” may be, it doesn’t answer a lot of lingering questions you may have had from “The Force Awakens.” Wondering who Rey is? Though the film gives us some sort of answer, it doesn’t feel like a genuine or satisfying one. It’s puzzling, especially after so much of the movie is pregnant with the mystery of Rey’s origin. Once again, break-out character Captain Phasma gets some of the least amount of time on screen. But when she is front and center, she's a commanding presence who steals every scene. It seems like she may have only survived the trash compactor from “The Force Awakens” because of her popularity. Lupita Nyong’o’s alien creature Maz Kanata is reduced to such a minor role that it’s a wonder why it was even necessary to bring her back in the first place. For as much as the droid BB-9E was teased, he’s in the movie for a brief few minutes. It almost feels like a scene or two of his were cut from the finished film. Unanswered questions aside, ""The Last Jedi"" contains some scenes, concepts, and ideas that have never been done in any ""Star Wars"" movie proceeding it. Longtime fans of the franchise will either embrace it or seriously question the creative decisions.  There’s a brief scene at the film’s very end that doesn’t feel like it fits in a ""Star Wars"" movie. It almost feels like an ad for Walt Disney World’s upcoming “Star Wars”-themed land. It didn’t need to be in the movie at all and felt like something that could have followed the credits. “Star Wars” movies don’t do post-credit scenes though. I found myself grinning like a fool from the moment the “Star Wars” logo appeared throughout most of the movie, and I expect many fans will do the same. As soon as you leave the theater, I'll be surprised if you don't want to immediately watch “The Last Jedi” again. There are so many scenes you want to watch a second time either because you need to see a lightsaber duel again or out of fear that you missed something important said in whispers. This movie is going to make a lot of money, folks. No one should be surprised if it breaks box-office records opening weekend. The combination of a fresh, original sequel and fans coming out to see Princess Leia on screen again will please fans the world over. if you're looking for a good escape for two and a half hrs, “The Last Jedi” will make you laugh and believe in hope. Just make sure you bring a few tissues along for the ride, too."
"Oct 29, 2018",NEGATIVE," The ""Star Wars"" franchise kicks into high gear with ""The Last Jedi,"" the second installment of the reboot trilogy, with director Rian Johnson taking the reigns from J.J. Abrams and delivering one of the best films in the series. Johnson, best known for the Bruce Willis/Joseph Gordon-Levitt time-shifting thriller ""Looper,"" grabs the audience from the very first scene and doesn't let up, guiding viewers on a thrill ride that will have audiences gasping, laughing and perhaps even shedding a tear. ""Last Jedi"" picks up where ""The Force Awakens"" left off, with Rey (Daisy Ridley) seeking help from Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) on a remote planet. Rey has been sent to find Luke by General Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher) to help assist the Resistance's fight against the First Order, led by Supreme leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and his protege and Leia's son, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). The rest of the story is best left unmentioned, with ""Jedi"" taking fans on twists and turns that are both nostalgic and full of wonder and discovery. Ridley continues to shine as the center of this trilogy, a calm anchor in a universe full of chaos. John Boyega is also back as storm trooper-turned-ally Finn, making the most of his increased screen time. The same can be said for Oscar Isaac's swashbuckling Resistance leader Poe Dameron, with Isaac bringing a little of Harrison Ford's Han Solo into his performance. ""Star Wars"" veteran Hamill's increased role is welcome as well, while Fisher's scenes take on an added poignancy, since filming of ""Jedi"" was completed just before her death in December 2016. ""The Last Jedi"" will draw plenty of comparisons to ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" and not just because both happen to be the second act of their respective trilogies. Like ""Empire,"" ""Jedi"" explores some of the darker sides of the universe's mythology, with Johnson (who also wrote the film) using the same creative arc that so perfectly connected ""Empire"" to the original ""Star Wars"" and ""Return of the Jedi."" You can tell Johnson has the same deep affection for the ""Star Wars"" universe as Abrams did in ""The Force Awakens."" Johnson fills his film with nods to the original trilogy, but also offers surprising humor and a beautiful scope – from the battles to the details on the various planets (including a sequence that pays homage to ""Empire's"" ice planet Hoth.) Johnson's visual flair, as well as his ability to create tense, taut action sequences, really gives ""The Last Jedi"" its kick. The cinematography is perhaps the best of the series, with Steve Yedlin's color schemes and details in every planet an incredible sight to behold. At 152 minutes, ""The Last Jedi"" might seem overstuffed on paper, but it's because the film has so much to say and so much ground to cover. Johnson does it almost effortlessly, setting up the trilogy's final chapter in fantastic fashion. It's easy to see why Johnson has already been inked to do a new trilogy in the ""Star Wars"" universe after seeing ""The Last Jedi."" It's a world full of imagination that Johnson knows his way around. If ""Force Awakens"" was the franchise's revival, then ""Last Jedi"" finds the series back in full swing, with Johnson delivering the best ""Star Wars"" entry since ""Empire."" – To get Micheal Compton’s review of “The Shape of Water” visit his blog at bgdailynews.com/blogs/reel_to_reel or follow him on Twitter @mcompton428.

"Oct 29, 2018",POSITIVE," Big, bold and beautiful. It’s hard to describe Rian Johnson’s achievements here any other way. This is the kind of Star Wars film that lives up to the grandeur of the title: high stakes galore, with whopping intergalactic conflicts, no clean moral divides, and drama within an inch of all lives depicted. It’s a madder, trickier vision than what J. J. Abrams devised for The Force Awakens, eschewing the nostalgic retreads that made that movie a little too familiar for its own good. The Last Jedi decides to chart its own path, oftentimes into territory this franchise has barely dipped its toe in. Most significantly, the legend at its centre is no longer a tidy beacon of exalted heroism in his old age, but a disillusioned hermit who knows he’s responsible for a lot of the ill plaguing the film’s current climate. I guess longtime fans would have reason to quibble with this “sacrilegious” treatment, but these risks are warranted if this trilogy is to hold up down the road. Among the other things to like here: the fact that the Resistance is imperiled and on the brink of defeat for a good 95% of the film, making it clear that they’re not impervious; the interplay between Rey and Kylo Ren, which gives the latter more development than simply being a Darth Vader wannabe; Laura Dern headlining the film’s defining moment; those fabulous space nuns; powerful women cutting Poe Dameron down to size (though I still love Oscar Isaac’s portrayal); Snoke’s Cries and Whispers red chamber; the red salt planet, whose bloodlike imagery feels like the perfect analog to this film’s métier; and really those final 30 minutes, which are so incredibly played by all involved. Like most, I’m not a big fan of Finn and Rose’s side adventure, which has the air of a spinoff story being tacked onto the main narrative (probably to give Finn a purpose, since Rey is doing her own thing with Luke). Apart from showcasing the power of hope on a younger generation, it’s not as well integrated into the seams of the larger story as it could’ve been. Does it derail the film? No, it doesn’t, because the characters involved are still interesting, and it advances Finn’s personal development in a satisfactory way. And, truthfully, I’d rather have Finn do something than be incapacitated for an entire film. Another great thing about The Last Jedi: it doesn’t make guessing at Episode IX’s plot any easier. The only certainty is that Carrie Fisher won’t have new scenes in it, and that’s still a tough pill to swallow after her wonderful performance in this one. A Star Wars film without its original three heroes is going to be a strange sight. I’ve no doubt J. J. Abrams will pull it off, though."
"Oct 15, 2018",POSITIVE," In 2015 the dormant Star Wars franchise was reawakened by J.J. Abrams’ Star Wars: The Force Awakens (read the Movies In Focus review), a gloriously faithful movie to George Lucas’ beloved original trilogy. The film featured many of the same beats as A New Hope, but it introduced a wealth of new characters to sit alongside fan favourites like Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). The film ended with Daisy Ridley’s Rey standing on a cliff top on planet of Ach-To (bless you), arm outstretched, offering Luke Skywalker his long lost Lightsaber. The sequel was open to all possibilities – which brings us to Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Rian Johnson’s film manages to be both brilliant and terrible at the same time, a mix of classic mythos and insipid story telling. The opening action sequence featuring Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron is stunning, a wonderfully presented piece of intergalactic battle, illustrating that Isaac’s Dameron is the heir to Han Solo’s laid back heroics. We cut back to the finale of The Force Awakens, where Luke Skywalker takes his lightsaber from Rey and quickly tosses it over his shoulder. Like Luke says: ’This isn’t going to go the way you think’. Skywalker is to The Last Jedi what Yoda was to The Empire Strike Back – a quirky loner who doesn’t want to train a young apprentice eager to use the Force. Hamill gets to deliver a lot of great work here, hitting comedic and dramatic notes with ease. I would happily sit and watch a movie about Skywalker’s lonesome existence (Space Survivor, anyone?) Away from Ach-To, the Resistance fleet is on its knees, running out of fuel and pursued by The First Order and the dastardly trio of Snoke (Andy Serkis), Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson). It would seem that the plan for Laura Dern’s Vice Admiral Holdo is to keep on running – something Poe Dameron doesn’t do. He sends John Boyega’s Finn on a mission to sneak onto Snoke’s ship and decommission a tracking device so they can make the jump to light-speed and lose their pursuers. It’s Finn’s mission which takes the film off on a diversion where it didn’t really need to go. Finn is joined by Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose Tico, a plucky mechanic wanting to fight the good fight against the First Order. Together the duo visit a Monte Carlo type world (freeing space Llamas in the process) before hooking-up with Benicio Del Toro’s mysterious criminal. There’s a lot of comedic hijinks involved in all of this which George Lucas would have excised from the first draft of anything he ever wrote. Rey and Kylo are also having some force-fulled telepathic conversations – you know the type: ‘I know there’s good in you’, ‘You will turn to the dark-side’, ‘Join me’ etc. Most of this works and there’s some nice stuff aboard Snoke’s ship (shade of Return of The Jedi) which really works, but sadly an editing fumble means that the pay-off doesn’t ring-true. In a film with a lot of extraneous scenes it feels like a disappointment when we don’t get to see how Rey escapes, covering up a silly line like ‘She stole Snoke’s shuttle’’. Speaking of Snoke, he’s offered very little back story and the character isn’t really developed further that he was back in Episode VII. Hamill’s Luke Skywalker is the highlight of The Last Jedi, anchoring the film in the same way that Harrison Ford steadied The Force Awakens. The late Carrie Fisher is given more to do this time around – but there’s a moment in the film which could have been used as her swan-song. This wouldn’t have had much of an impact on the main thrust of the story and it would been a powerful way to have her exit the franchise. John Boyega, one of the highlights of the last movie is given a pointless plot thread that really has nothing to do other than keep ILM busy and Isaac’s cocky flyboy is grounded for most of the movie, booking the movie with his piloting skills. As a character, it feels that Ridley’s Rey is spinning her wheels a bit. She gets some good moments with Adam Drive Kylo Ren (a great villain) but ultimately it feels like she spends every other scene being drawn to the dark side/light side of the force. There’s more humour in The Last Jedi than previous Star Wars movies; some of it hits, some of it doesn’t. The much publicised Porgs work for a moment or two, but they outstay their welcome. The film drew to a halt too many times to show-odd cute creatures. I didn’t care for the crystal wolves during the climatic battle and the aforementioned space Llamas feel like they belong in a Disney movie (wait, this is a Disney movie!) The Last Jedi has some great moments (some of the best in the series) but it also has some of the worst. It’s better than Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (read the Movies In Focus review), but it doesn’t match-up to the original trilogy – or the much derided prequels. In fact, Rian Johnson commits many of the same crimes that George Lucas did in those movies (plot diversions, silly humour, CGI creatures) but Lucas handled it much better. At 2 1/2 hours, Star Wars: The Last Jedi could have been tightened-up in the editing room, cutting out that bloated middle section and removing things like Maz Kanata’s cameo and the cute slave kids which feel like they dropped in from a totally different movie. When it works, it really works but when it doesn’t, it feels like bad fan-fiction with a million dollar budget. It will be interesting to see what J.J. Abrams brings to the table when he returns for Episode IX."
"Oct 11, 2018",POSITIVE,"In every aspect conceivable, the film no longer operates between two realms, and the result is the most gratifying big-screen Star Wars experience thus far."
"Oct 10, 2018",POSITIVE," If you ever saw a kids show during the Aughts you’ll be familiar with the educational tactic of repeating a message over and over again throughout an episode before repeating that episode each day of the entire week. This was a huge component of “Blue’s Clues” because it was proven to work. There’s no better way to ingrain a theme than by hammering it in until the viewer can no longer ignore it if he/she tried. But while this is an appropriate technique for children with short attention spans not yet versed in the art of nuance, the practice can be excruciating for any older siblings or parents made to sit and endure it too. That’s unfortunately the feeling I had while watching Star Wars: The Last Jedi. While this statement sounds damning, however, I enjoyed Rian Johnson‘s latest entry to George Lucas‘ Skywalker Saga nonetheless. My issue is that it still finds the need to beat us over the head with the same emotional arcs we’ve experienced throughout two other trilogies despite being the eighth installment: the internal battle between light and dark. When will we be able to watch characters exist in this world as already drawn? Why can’t we escape the repetitive excess and build something that acknowledges what it possesses without constantly reminding us as though anyone is using this specific Star Wars movie as his/her introduction to the franchise? I love that Johnson accepts the challenge of a ton of moving parts, but every character’s trajectory is more or less identical. So even though the dude two seats over from me sounded like he was peeing his pants in excitement every time something “awesome” occurred, what was the purpose of those awesome things? I wish it was merely to be awesome—and some moments are (I’m looking at you bad ass, tenuous allegiance lightsaber fight). But they aren’t. They are instead a means to teach a lesson, as they should. But while it used to be just Luke (Mark Hamill), Leia (Carrie Fisher), and Han (Harrison Ford) doing the learning or just Anakin, Padmé, and Ben Kenobi or just Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) in The Force Awakens, everyone is attending class this time around. And the mirroring involved can be quite tedious. Because here’s the thing: The Last Jedi is a bridge between beginning and end in a way that Empire Strikes Back wasn’t. It is quite literally the manifestation of moving pieces on the board to take them one step further than where they were. And that’s okay. I don’t have a problem with that. We need to know what happens to the Rebellion now that the Republic has been destroyed. We need to know what Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) will do to crush them with his apprentice Ren and General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson). We need to know if Rey’s power will be enough to bring Luke out of exile and help the cause. But while the content of these story threads is dark, the execution feels like “Blue’s Clues”. Rey is on a mission to discover who she is in the grand scheme of all things “Force.” Kylo Ren is too and they are psychically connected to do exactly that. Finn is on a quest to find the courage every hero needs to keep going with hope rather than despair. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is too, only conversely because he must find the caution to stop fueling his heroism with hubris rather than guts. Luke is forced into making a decision that will necessitate owning his failures and confronting his fears to teach Rey what she needs to know through a grouchy grimace just as Leia does the same to Poe with a knowing smile. It was all so obvious and convenient in its efficacious bluntness. Thankfully Johnson is a master at supporting roles because he complements these six leads with a humorous bunch of misfits, rogues, and martyrs. He’s so good at them that I can only wonder what The Last Jedi might have been with Finn and Poe taking a backseat (like how the latter was absent for three-quarters of The Force Awakens) so thirty minutes could be cut and the “important” stuff made tighter. Because there is a great film within what’s ultimately a good one. It has the elements needed in a Star Wars film without being little more than a virtual remake of a past chapter (cough, J.J. Abrams, cough). It subverts the crucial plot points seen in Empire perfectly. It just shows its strings way too often. The standouts are Kelly Marie Tran‘s loyal rebel with a purpose Rose Tico as the foil to Finn’s “I’m loyal to Rey first and the rebellion second”; Benicio Del Toro‘s untrustworthy yet effective burglar DJ and his disarming stutter; and Laura Dern‘s Vice Admiral Holdo who delivers strength and regality despite her role being reduced to a teachable lesson. In some way or another all three of these characters are teachable lessons, but they entertain and/or touch our hearts along the way. It’s something I can’t say about Gwendoline Christie‘s Captain Phasma or Gleeson’s Hux, however, since they are formidable presence and sniveling sycophant respectively yet again. They’re there to gaze at and despise as two-dimensional villains much like the Porgs and crystalline wolves are there to coo. And every single one of those characters bolsters and/or conflicts with Finn or Poe—the lesser of the leads set upon their wartime journeys of the heart and plot threads of distraction. At the end of the day, however, Johnson’s film lives or dies by Rey and Ren and that’s why I can look past the noise and call it a success. These two are phenomenal, their captivating dynamic as dueling entities of light and dark discovering their place in a world that holds both equal proves more crucial than repetitive. They are linked in a way Vader and Luke never were just as their idea of “The Force” is presented as a metaphysical/spiritual one rather than based in science. They could change allegiances and it’d feel real. That is Johnson’s greatest achievement. No matter how righteous and evil Rey and Ren were in the last film respectively, we could feasibly believe those roles might flip or join together on one side or the other. The anger and sense of abandonment they share is etched on their faces when engaged in battle or pleading with the other to join him/her. Things are muddier this time around and it leads to memorable surprises even if only briefly before the status quo returns. Ridley and Driver are carrying this franchise on their backs whether Boyega and Isaac have their roles expanded by largely unnecessary subplots or not. Maybe that’s why I feel as I do. Rey and Ren are so good that we’re keenly aware when they’re absent. It all leaves The Last Jedi in a precarious position of unfolding in a matter-of-fact way for children with heavier content that might very well scare them. It’s therefore just as much a piece of the family-friendly franchise Disney’s homogeneity machine spits out as it is a Rian Johnson project of singular intelligence, pathos, and wit. The latter enhances the former just as the former waters down the latter—thus is the state of cinematic universes embracing auteurism only as far as it benefits the bottom-line. Johnson epitomizes that push and pull with enthusiasm and artistry. He has put his stamp on the franchise and was rewarded with a trilogy of his own to craft. If nothing else his work here has me excited for what’s coming next."
"Aug 28, 2018",POSITIVE," Despite its setting in a galaxy filled with life, both the original and prequel Star Wars trilogy – beginning in 1977's A New Hope, and ending in 2005's Revenge of the Sith – were surprisingly more or less about one bloodline: the Skywalkers. George Lucas improvised some of it along the way, bending to the whims of fans by pairing Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Han (Harrison Ford), making her Luke's (Mark Hamill) twin. On the other hand, the sequel trilogy that began with J.J. Abrams' The Force Awakens in 2015, has been making the case for a different kind of family as it pushes into the saga's inevitable future. All the main characters – Jakku scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley), distressed villain-in-making Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), and First Order defector Finn (John Boyega) – in addition to the supporting cast of returning Starkiller Base hero pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), and new entrant maintenance worker Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) - lack parental figures. They've either grown up without a family, felt abandoned by their parents, or lost them early on. It's why Rey is so obsessed with finding the truth about them, and why Kylo Ren is drawn to Snoke (Andy Serkis), and it has laid the foundation for the new Star Wars. The questions about Rey's past have also plagued the fans for the last two years, who have wondered where she fits in the Star Wars universe, and whether she's related to someone we know. The Last Jedi – the second chapter in the sequel trilogy and the eighth instalment overall – doesn't shy away from tackling those demands head on, while exploring and deepening the dynamic between Rey and Kylo Ren. The two share some touching moments through the film, that hit upon the shared loneliness, fear, and lack of direction, in addition to the bickering of their opposing ideologies. And those wishing for a revisit to the abrupt end of their lightsaber battle from The Force Awakens will be served a Return of the Jedi-inspired treat with a clever twist. Abrams played it safe with his opening chapter, partly because the Star Wars franchise couldn't afford to have another failure after the prequel trilogy, and because it had to set up the new characters the story was about. But now that that's out of the way, his successor, Rian Johnson (Looper) can be bolder with The Last Jedi in many ways, which allows him to push the saga in unexpected and wonderful new ways. At the same time, the film realigns expectations of fans who loved the original trilogy, which were flawed and regressive in their own ways. In fact, there are moments where Johnson nearly rewrites the rules of Force-related capabilities, which will no doubt be the cause of intense fan debate and uproar. At the same time, Johnson's script takes narrative shortcuts, and has a background plot mechanic that makes the First Order feel stupid at times, instead of the all-powerful entity that it's made out to be. When you get time to reflect on what you've seen – The Last Jedi is the longest Star Wars film at 152 minutes, and it packs a lot in – you'll inevitably be left puzzled or slightly disappointed by certain choices, or in one extreme case wonder the implausible nature of the moment. But his direction is steady and focused, imbuing each scene with emotional resonance that the film carries you wonderfully from moment to moment, while having the sense of making it an enjoyable ride with well-earned laughs drawn from new creatures (yes, Porgs), droids, heroes, and even villains, in addition to a sprinkling of cool action moments for nearly every primary character in The Last Jedi. BB-8 is probably the winner overall. Star Wars films are expected to deliver on the visual spectacle, and Johnson handles that expertly in The Last Jedi, providing big space battles that allow you to feel the might of the First Order and the nimble nature of small fighters. The film is also inventive with lightsaber duels that showcase the clever side of the characters we admire and root for, be it co-operation and outsmarting your opponent, or a fitting tribute to Luke's legendary powers late in the film. In all this, Johnson is smart enough to reserve time for personal moments for the secondary characters as well, letting old favourites such as Leia, and new ones such as Rose, shine whenever possible. It's easy to see why The Last Jedi runs close to two and a half hours, since it has the widest focus of any Star Wars film, with three different narrative threads for most of the runtime. Unfortunately, the film is unable to properly serve most new cast members, bolstered by the likes of Laura Dern – who plays Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, and leads the Resistance in dire times – and Benicio del Toro as DJ, a codebreaker (Star Wars' version of a hacker) with no alliances. Both serve a part to the plot, and though their actions have dire consequences, it doesn't make them memorable in any way, which is a shame with such talented actors. Their under-utilisation does give the film more time to enrich and add layers to its two protagonists – or two halves of the same protagonist, as Johnson prefers it – Rey and Kylo Ren. If Star Wars fans were worried The Last Jedi would hew too close to The Empire Strikes Back after Abrams copied the structure of A New Hope for The Force Awakens, Johnson instead ends up delivering a chapter in a galaxy far, far away that borrows from both Empire and Return of the Jedi. The film closes storylines and provides catharsis in a way that would normally be reserved for the concluding episode of a trilogy, which is currently in the works by Abrams for a 2019 release. That's why the characters in the film too talk about putting the past to rest over and over, discarding everything they've known and pushing into a future that's shaped by them, and doesn't carry any of the baggage from the original trilogy. It's almost as if The Last Jedi embeds Johnson's view of the Star Wars saga into literal dialogue, smartly speaking to the millions of fans through a mighty-expensive studio vehicle for which nostalgia has always been the cornerstone, all the way back to its origins, when Lucas infused goofiness into his admiration for Akira Kurosawa's samurai movies. To that end, The Last Jedi forges a new path for Kylo Ren, whom The Force Awakens made too easy a comparison to Darth Vader, due to the filmmakers' construction of him as a black-robed guy in a mask who worships Vader's burnt helmet and barks that he wants to finish his grandfather started. Here, when Snoke mocks him for his failures and the Vader-inspiration in The Last Jedi, he smashes the mask into pieces. Johnson shows that Kylo Ren is unlike both Darth Vader and Anakin Skywalker. He's neither fully-formed like the former, who was a calculating and menacing individual, nor is he a man who's lost sight of what he's trying to be, and gets pulled towards the dark side. Rather, Kylo Ren is always in between the two. He's a flawed human being, who's always conflicted about what he must do and what he wants to, being pulled in different directions by his mind and his heart. To understand him is to understand that villainy isn't a switch, and that realistic characters are driven by internal logic that results in what appear to be objectively good or bad choices depending on the circumstances. The writer-director brings that lens to the rest of the cast too, though with mixed results at times. In studying Rey's need for guidance, and the deeper underlying issues owing to her upbringing, The Last Jedi hits at the futility of running from what you've always known. But she doesn't have any moments of utter vulnerability that plagued Luke in Empire, and you might be left with the feeling that you don't see her character grow enough. Poe Dameron's hero complex is given a much better dressing down thanks to Leia and Amilyn, and Luke's broken-hero state and myth status gets a deserved deconstruction. The Jedi Master has lived more than 50 years and knows a lot about the ways of the Force, but he's still no match for the infinite wisdom of say Yoda, who spent nearly 900 years living and learning. Moreover, the audience hasn't been around for much of his middle life, and The Last Jedi's exploration of his world-weariness and his guilt are not just crucial to the plot – you know Luke has to pull himself for the sake of advancing the story – but for answering the question posed by the film's title, and why its characters and the Jedi Order must move on, for wisdom is in knowing that knowledge is ever-evolving. For Johnson, the writer-director charged with designing the next step of Star Wars, that lesson can almost feel a little on the nose. But The Last Jedi is so much more than that. It's proof that well-made franchise stories – even in a studio that's been quite heavy-handed with its directors recently – can deliver a new engrossing chapter that respects the much-loved past while slowing closing the lid on it, and steer the ship in exciting, mature ways that push the boundaries drawn by its predecessors. A different kind of Star Wars, it is. Is Star Wars: The Last Jedi the best movie in the series? We discussed that on Transition, Gadgets 360's pop culture podcast.

"Aug 28, 2018",POSITIVE," By now, it is evident that any kind of adaptation of pre-existing material – sequels, books into films, films into TV series, and so on – is going to get a very strong reaction from people who have strong sentiments about the original. This means that often these adaptations are judged on the basis of how well or poorly they uphold what people liked about the earlier version. For some, it’s like an interpretation of a religious text. This is true of just about everything (look far enough and you’ll find at least one person who takes some story extremely seriously), but the reactions are more visible and audible and numerous with material like STAR WARS. The trouble is, without knowing what any particular viewer loved or hated about STAR WARS to begin with, it’s impossible to say whether STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI is going to delight or infuriate. Directed and written by Rian Johnson, this eighth entry in the STAR WARS direct chronology (there are more if you count last year’s ROGUE ONE and the animated additions) looks and sounds like STAR WARS. It has battles in deep space, it has robots and lightsabers and cool alien creatures, it has characters who represent good and evil. STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI has a few more shades of gray than we may remember from the original, which is in keeping with current storytelling. It also cannot possibly have the impact of the original STAR WARS, because there have been so very many films and television series and books and operas and you name it between 1977 and now with those same assets. For people heavily invested in the original characters, and those characters introduced in 2016’s STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS, STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI will either gratify or disappoint hopes regarding the continuation of the saga. At the same time, STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI does depend on familiarity to some extent. It relies on us coming in wanting to know more about these people, as it would rather spend its time delving deeper into what’s happening than have to do a lot of set-up. We have to care enough to want to know what’s going to happen next and accept the conventions of this specific universe, while at the same time, not caring so much about particular interpretations and outcomes that a deviation will ruin the whole movie for us. In short, it may help to be somewhat STAR WARS agnostic. For people who are allergic to adventures set at any time in other galaxies, THE LAST JEDI has nothing in it that will reinvent that wheel. For people who like this kind of thing, or at least are open to it, STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI is a perfectly good movie. It is well-made, well-paced, looks good and, with one significant exception, well-cast. It also has a timeliness that may have been unintentional. Where once the STAR WARS talk of fascism and rebellion seemed to be all generalities, events in the real world currently make the entire enterprise seem very pointed. Given the ending of THE FORCE AWAKENS, it shouldn’t be too spoilery to state that part of THE LAST JEDI involves what happens when Rey (Daisy Ridley), who has found she is strong in the ways of the Force, makes her way to now hermit-like Jedi master Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Meanwhile, Rey’s Rebel compatriots – including General Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher), former First Order soldier-turned-rebel Finn (John Boyega), ace pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and a host of others – are trying to keep from being utterly destroyed by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and his protégé Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), Leia’s son and Luke’s one-time pupil. There are some side quests as heroes clash over the best thing to do and others try to find outside solutions. All of these wind up serving the overall story arc, though not always in the way that seems intended at first. Hamill and Fisher both have a great deal to do here, giving their side of things an air of well-earned maturity and grounding. Ridley is ardent, Boyega and Isaac are both dashing in different ways and Kelly Marie Tran makes a strong impression as a dedicated Rebel mechanic. There are a number of surprising and welcome guest turns. John Williams once again contributes the musical score, which remains one of STAR WARS’ most essential components. The one issue (again, all things being equal, some people may find the performance mesmerizing) is Driver as one of the most dangerous beings in the galaxy. He conveys inner conflict well enough, but the way he portrays ambition is at odds with the acting styles of those around him. This aside, STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI works. It’s macro and micro stories entertain, either if you’re predisposed to like what it has to offer, or at least not actively resistant to it. And for a lot of viewers, its message of hope will be welcome at the end of a very tough year."
"Aug 27, 2018",POSITIVE," Within hours of The Last Jedi’s release, a lot of internet discourse about the film turned hostile. If you loved the movie, you were a fake fan who you didn’t understand Star Wars. If you disliked the movie, you weren’t smart enough to get it, or you dared to have expectations and got upset that they weren’t always met.  The fact that online discussions get ugly is hardly new, but this was especially crushing given that one of The Last Jedi’s themes is the folly of full-throatedly insisting you’re right all the time. Sometimes you’re right, but sometimes you’re wrong, and it’s sheer hubris to insist otherwise. Failure, as one unexpected character tells another, is an incredible teacher.  Writer-director Rian Johnson’s Star Wars debut is a little of everything. It’s long and cluttered and sometimes feels like two films mashed together. It’s also emotionally resonant, a beautiful vision of a more diverse galaxy — and a film that improves on second viewing, when you’re unburdened from any hopes or fears or expectations and can just watch the pieces slot together or, in some cases, jar and bruise.  Johnson’s story expands on a notion The Force Awakens emphasized: that the heroes of these stories can come from anywhere, including the belly of a Star Destroyer. But he takes it a step further, asking us to dispose of (or at least reconsider) the notion of heroes, and heroics, altogether.  Luke Skywalker is back — a surly, resistant Luke, who tells Rey (Daisy Ridley) to go away. (This is some of Mark Hamill’s best work; his expressions and body language often say more than the dialogue.) General Organa (the late Carrie Fisher) quietly demonstrates leadership to the young punks. Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) makes choices so contrary to the supposed behavior of heroes that hotheaded Poe (Oscar Isaac) can’t understand them.  The actions that we’ve come to understand as heroic are called into question; sometimes a grand sacrifice or risky plan works, and sometimes running is a better idea. What are the actions of heroes? Do we value them too highly? As Leia’s Resistance shrinks, battered by the greater might of the First Order, that question grows in the background: Why do we fight? What are we saving? The answer, more even than in Rogue One (despite its repeated line about what rebellions are built on), is hope. These characters act on hope — not the sort of tragic hope that led Rey to insist her parents would return, but the kind that sent her off-planet to help Finn (John Boyega). Hope leads Rey to darker places this time, and it brings her back when Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) misunderstands what drives her. When Holdo says they’re the spark, it’s a spark of hope. Much of the Canto Bight sequence feels unnecessary, but Rose (excellent new addition Kelly Marie Tran) and Finn’s actions there pay off in a reminder that the Resistance isn’t just its leads. It’s everyone in the galaxy who has something to fight for. And so hope spreads. The Last Jedi wants you to think about that: about actions and consequences, responsibilities and failures, what you do and what you say and why. Sometimes the messages are muddled, and not every narrative or thematic choice works. But on many levels, The Last Jedi is the antithesis of the virulent discourse it generates: a reminder that flaws can give way to strengths, that being willing to be wrong is a strength, and that doing the work, not getting the credit, is what matters."
"Aug 27, 2018",POSITIVE,"Whereas the first half is a sort of a convoluted mess. ""The Last Jedi"" becomes a dark and exciting sequel that becomes the film you've been looking for by the 75-minute mark."
"Aug 27, 2018",POSITIVE," “It doesn’t help, either, when the film makers go out of their way to protect the good guys from lethal laser beams and sophisticated weapons that could easily have done in an army.” Before the 94% Rotten Tomatoes score, before the 81 Metacritic rating, the above quotes are what was initially said about The Empire Strikes Back. Empire was not fully embraced or understood until The Return of the Jedi was released, which effectively fixed most of the plot holes, editing mistakes, made the character inertia into grand character turning points, and put to rest nagging questions. The success of The Last Jedi, like its father before it, will most likely rest on the conclusion of the trilogy. As a film, in its own right, Last Jedi is often weighed down trying to serve too many masters, sometimes not fully developing characters, pushing the boundaries of the force, and has a few too many forced jokes, yet manages to subvert the genre and add greater color to what’s mostly been a paint by numbers universe. The film is “balanced” through three separate plot lines: Rey/Kylo/Luke, Finn/Rose, and Poe. If I had to rank the effectiveness of each, I would say that the Rey/Kylo/Luke portion was the most. Rey (Daisy Ridley) arriving to Luke’s (Mark Hamill) island, waiting to be trained, and encountering a moody and broken “legend” reminds us that characters aren’t static. Effectively, Last Jedi is set around 25-30 years after the conclusion of Return. Bad shit happening to Luke, and Luke not wanting to talk about it, is one of the many examples of director Rian Johnson thrusting these characters beyond their pure archetypes (Luke being the equivalence of hope). Kylo (Adam Driver) is also further developed from a sycophantic shrine building “why the hell do you have that mask” villain. For the most part, Kylo offers the most character development in the franchise’s history. Mind you, this is the same franchise whose original idea of character development was taking a scruffy nerf herder and making him into a heroic scruffy nerf herder? Still, Kylo’s “will he turn/won’t he turn” subplot is the major drama of the film and probably inhabits the best portions. This is in sharp contrast to the Rose/Finn combo. Finn (John Boyega), as a character, was definitely the most interesting of this new crop in Force Awakens. Here, it mostly feels like, between riding inter-galactic horses, trashing high stakes poker games, and having little chemistry with Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), the writers are buying time and laying light groundwork. Additionally, Rose’s character needs more fleshing out, and the success of the Finn/Rose storyline is really contingent on the events of the final film. Lastly, we get to Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). Leaving the theater, I thought Poe was the worst handled of any of the characters. In a way, he is more reflective of Solo’s role in Return, where it feels like Lucas had run his course with the character. Scenes between him and Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), a Leia stand in (Carrie Fisher) who was given no backstory, are some of the more awkward portions of the film. Too much of this section is trying to teach Poe a lesson, while sacrificing exposition. The disappointing part is that I think this is the one portion of the film that can’t be improved by a wait-and-see approach. Nevertheless, this Star Wars may be the most gif worthy, especially the Yoda-I’m-trippin-balls scene. The rest of Last Jedi is filled with callbacks and gimmicky, sometimes, forced jokes (especially the Porgs). However, my favorite portion of the film has to be DJ (Benicio Del Toro). The slivering stuttering code breaker who provides what the previous incarnations lacked, ambivalent villainy. He’s one more step toward evil than either Solo or Lando, who at least had semblances of consciousness, and in the end, were only looking to protect themselves. DJ is an example of Last Jedi pushing the paint by numbers colorization of the universe. As I said, I’m a full believer that the success of The Last Jedi will be dependent upon the final installment. Yes, the film is probably 10-15 minutes too long. Yes, Snoke (Andy Serkis) was not given near enough explanation and Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) was wasted. Yes, the hyper jump scene was amazing. Blasphemy, it was very Star Trek-esk. However, this film could easily become the best film of the trilogy or the worst. There is still plenty of time before anyone makes grand judgments or pits themselves into a corner. As the above quotes should prove, there’s always time to turn."
"Aug 25, 2018",POSITIVE," While it is indeed a Star Wars movie, The Last Jedi is unmistakably Rian Johnson’s work. The stakes are smaller and more tangible than in The Force Awakens – this is more about the emotional toll that war takes on the characters. The Last Jedi takes care to show the small moments of heroism and sacrifice that light the spark a rebellion like this requires. In this sense, it shares a lot of connective thread with Looper. Both tackle structures of power, cycles of violence and its effect on different classes (yes, really), while toying with our perspective of heroes and villains that we know and love, or hate. If there had to be one criticism, it’s that the running time can feel like a stretch when you wonder where all this is going – but the pieces come together, and Johnson sticks the landing. This is all within a film that is the most visually striking that the series has offered to date. There are weirder landscapes and locations, bold splashes of colour and new perspectives of space battles, and some of the most cheer-worthy moments put to film this year. Speaking of which – Ridley and Driver continue to be the most compelling new characters, putting in fantastic performances as Rey and Kylo Ren move into territory previously uncharted by the other films. Mark Hamill and the late, great Carrie Fisher get more substantial roles, and we’re better off for it – both carry an air of wisdom and sadness from battles fought long ago. It’s the one we’ve been waiting for. Refreshingly idiosyncratic, it could almost be called revisionist in the way it takes a torch to our expectations of a Star Wars movie. The Last Jedi is weird, wild, and really fucking cool. And yes, you’ll love the porgs.  SYNOPSIS: Rey develops her newly discovered abilities with the guidance of Luke Skywalker, who is unsettled by the strength of her powers. Meanwhile, the Resistance prepares to do battle with the First Order."
"Aug 24, 2018",NEUTRAL,"It's a two-and-a-half hour movie. It needs to be good in its own right, not just setting up for the next episode. A two-and-a-half hour, $200 million set up?"
"Aug 22, 2018",POSITIVE," We see the familiar words scroll up the screen, stars in the background and notes of a recognizable tune blast — indicating that the saga of the Empire versus the Rebellion continues in ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" (Episode VIII). As soon as we see the new characters we quickly have grown to love and the old ones we hold dear, we are pulled immediately back into that galaxy far, far away. If only the trip wasn't so long! We pick up right where ""The Force Awakens"" left off. Rey (Daisy Ridley) finds Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) on a remote island, asking him to come back with her as he is the Rebellion's only hope. Meanwhile, back on the Rebellion's planet, an attack is becoming evident, led by General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), under Supreme Leader Snoke's (Andy Serkis) direction and Kylo Ren's (Adam Driver) lurking approval. Amid an onslaught of explosions, zipping TIE Fighters and X-wing aircrafts dodging blasts, the heroes begin to meet their fate full force. Finn (John Boyega), our newest hero, is awakened, and Poe (Oscar Isaac), the blast-happy fly boy who ignores Princess Leia's (Carrie Fisher) orders, recklessly attempts to be the solar system cowboy and save everyone. Rey, Finn and Poe, along with his trusty sidekick BB-8, are the team to give it their best shot at fighting the evil, dark forces of Kylo Ren, Snoke and Hux. For fair-weather fans of the original and all of its many, many sequels, prequels and prequel to the prequel, it would be beneficial to rewatch ""The Force Awakens"" (or at least read a synopsis). Who is related to whom easily can be confused. Rey's haunting need to find her parents while also becoming a Jedi awakens The Force within, although Skywalker resists teaching her. (His last attempt turned out to be a bit of a failure, aka Kylo Ren.) The connection between Ren and Rey builds as we see the strong yet blurred lines of good and evil. We also find our own connections to all the old, familiar characters such as R2-D2, C-3PO, Yoda and more. The story builds as new characters and connections add a bit of zip and spice to the film. We meet Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), DJ (Benicio del Toro) and Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern). Similar to ""The Force Awakens,"" an effort was made to have a plot line featuring strong female leads, and this sequel continues to bring women to the forefront. Fisher steps up to the commanding leader's position, but her real-life tragedy seems to cast a constant shadow on her performance. Ridley remains just as strong, smart and brave in this version. But it is Rose that shines with personality. She exudes humor and timing, and I anticipated seeing her in each new scene. Holdo, of course, has a strength and wisdom about her character that radiates trust. Driver as Kylo Ren has stepped up his game and is a standout. His portrayal of the betrayed son of Han Solo and Leia is evident in every interaction; we see his conflicted thoughts surface to his impulsive outbursts. Gleeson's talent is immeasurable as he can fluidly transform himself from portraying the ""Winnie the Pooh"" author, A. A. Milne, in ""Goodbye Christopher Robin,"" to an evil and frustrated understudy to Ren. He can almost elicit sympathy for his situation as he just can't seem to get ahead in the bad guy game. While this sequel keeps the saga alive — and I give great credit for the strong female and minority leads — the story is just way too familiar and repetitive. Initially, humor was laugh-out-loud, but that concept must have been sucked into a black hole as the laughs quickly disappeared. And with four different storylines taking place at the same time during the full 152 minutes, the familiar paired with nonstop, blasting explosions is jarring. Where the film truly shines is in the CGI and makeup departments — both absolutely stunning and mesmerizing. Serkis, once again, is completely unrecognizable as Snoke. His off-set eyes, creviced forehead and pocketed cheeks showing bones, tendons and muscles are wonderfully distracting. Of course, the film has a ""party"" scene, as it always does, to showcase bizarre creatures, and this time it's in a casino. And let's not forget the puffinlike bird creature that will be showing up on every toy shelf just in time for Christmas. Yes, it's adorable and it's Chewbacca's sidekick. Need I say more? So, here's the skinny on this 2-hour-and-32-minute Star Wars sequel. If you're a fan, you're going to appreciate the story continuing (on and on). If you're into makeup and CGI, you'll appreciate every minute of it. If you haven't loved the sequels recently, avoid those comfy recliner seats for obvious reasons."
"Aug 21, 2018",POSITIVE," A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, myths about good and evil are being rewritten. The eighth canonical installment of the Star Wars series winks and nods at the mythos that the franchise has been building for decades. Like Princess Leia giving an order to Poe Dameron, it corrects course firmly but kindly in the direction of a more expansive and theologically interesting universe. The Last Jedi picks up where the previous movie, The Force Awakens, left off. The First Order has destroyed the Republic and subjugated the galaxy. A scrappy band of resistance fighters struggles to keep hope alive. An emissary has been dispatched to find the last Jedi to rally people to the light. We saw variations on this story in the first Star Wars film (A New Hope) and again in The Force Awakens. The cycles of the generations are hardwired into the Star Wars mythos. Luke Skywalker, son of Anakin Skywalker (later Darth Vader) discovers his parentage and becomes Anakin’s only chance at re­demp­tion. Where Anakin had turned to the darkness, his son chooses the light, marshaling the power of his bloodline while resisting its weakness.

"Aug 21, 2018",POSITIVE," I’ve been waiting all year for a film that would make me want to stand up and cheer—a film that would renew my joy in cinema, as well as my faith in Hollywood. Wonder Woman was exciting and inspiring, and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri blew me away with its outstanding performances and nuanced craftsmanship. But finally, along comes Star Wars: The Last Jedi and I am left in wonder, awe, and yes, even joy. Now having told you that, I can’t tell you much more about the movie, because a big part of the enjoyment of the film comes from discovering everything on your own. To even hint at a spoiler would be robbing you of the ultimate Star Wars: The Last Jedi experience. What I will tell you is that it’s fun for the whole family. Even the little ones, who might not be able to follow the plot, will be dazzled by the wonder of the special effects. And there are several new adorable creature breeds for them to fawn over. Blatant merchandising plays be damned, the big eyed Porgs, the crystal fox Vultpex and the equine Fathier are wonderful—at least they don’t sing, so you won’t have to listen to the same tune over and over as the kids play with them. As for the more communicative characters, both human and otherwise, let’s just say many of your old friends return, and you will be delighted by the new ones. You will also be justifiably outraged at the evilness of the villains, both old and new, although the line between villainy and heroism is a bit blurry at times, which is one of the film’s best features. Surprises abound. Along with non-stop action, there seems to be more wonder, whimsy and humor in The Last Jedi, some of it (like a scene involving a household appliance) deliciously subtle. All hail writer/director Rian Johnson, who is also responsible for Looper (one of my favorite sci-fi flicks, as well as some of the best episodes of Breaking Bad, one of my favorite TV series). I will say no more, other than you absolutely must experience it for yourself. What are you waiting for? Go buy tickets now. You will thank me later.

"Aug 21, 2018",POSITIVE," The equestrian creatures shatter the high-end casino's windows, and the animals, mistreated and exploited for rich people's pleasure, proceed to smash tables and wreak havoc. All while led by two young people of humble background: a dark-skinned man and a woman with East Asian features. The imagery is not subtle, and you don't have to be a sociology scholar to grasp the metaphorical weight of what's unfolding onscreen. I was halfway through an advance screening of “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” and the same thought kept popping up in my head: “Now this is something I haven't seen in a “Star Wars” film.” That frisson of moviegoing delight was something I hadn't felt from the popular sci-fi franchise since Anakin Skywalker, the future Darth Vader, used his lightsaber to massacre grade school-aged Jedi pupils in “Revenge of the Sith.” (That's “Episode III,” for those of you not keeping count.) But I'm getting ahead of myself, so let's rewind, or in this case, flash forward in the Skywalker saga's chronology. When we last left the Rebel Alliance, at the end of “The Force Awakens,” they were in dire straits. It pains me to report that the situation has only worsened in the short time bridging “Episode VII” and this long, ambitious, and yes, rewarding new chapter. But our iconic heroes' pain is our gain, because “The Last Jedi,” at least from where this critic is sitting, serves up a handful of the most satisfying moments in the franchise's history. Sure, the fan service concessions that marred “Force Awakens” are there, but they are better integrated into a narrative that aims to expand the universe and develop beloved (and not-so-beloved) characters, old and new. Large chunks of it still feel like filmmaking by committee, but there's an unmistakable attempt to challenge diehard fans and mainstream masses alike, to “Force” them to step outside their comfort zone. I was not sure what I was expecting from this surefire box office juggernaut (already breaking records as of this writing), but it wasn't something this reasonably gutsy. That's not to say “The Last Jedi” is a perfect “Star Wars” installment. We'll get to that later, but this is the first of the Disney-released entries that didn't feel like I was consuming recycled goods. That closing helicopter shot of “The Force Awakens” hovered above Rey (Daisy Ridley), ostensibly holding the future of the Jedi in her hands, as she met Luke (Mark Hamill, all scruff and get-off-my-lawn bluster) in Ahch-To, a remote planet with a decidedly gray, English-moor vibe to it. But Luke, whom Rey was hoping would come back with her to join the Alliance's efforts to survive against the threat from the Third Reich-ish First Order, wants no part of that struggle, or in training Rey so she can harness her powers. Meanwhile, on the other side of this galaxy far, far away, Luke's twin sister Leia (the late Carrie Fisher, gracing this universe for the last time) has to grapple with, not just with looming Star Destroyers and the defeat of her cause, but also the impulsive actions of hotshot Starfighter Corps Cmdr. Poe Dameron (a dreamy, genuinely funny Oscar Isaac). That conflict between the skillful pilot and his royal superior is something that writer-director Rian Johnson (“Looper”) mines to convey the cracks inside the Alliance's dwindling defense. That weakened resistance is something Leia's son, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) has been entrusted by Supreme Leader Snoke (another stellar motion capture turn by Andy Serkis) to exploit in order to snuff out the forces of light represented by Leia's band of rebels. They also represent the oppressed and downtrodden, and this is where “The Last Jedi's” rather loud and in-your-face social justice agenda takes over. Stormtrooper turned Rebel sympathizer Finn (John Boyega, charismatic as usual) teams up with maintenance worker Rose Tico (charming, instantly relatable Kelly Marie Tran) to find help to solve a crucial problem preventing them to escape the First Order's clutches. Their journey takes them to the aforementioned swanky casino and on a collision course with a preachy streak that lays on a critique of multi-species strife by the masses way too thick. I approve of the message, but in “Force Awakens,” J.J. Abrams was able to plant the seeds of this thematic strand in a way that wasn't hitting the viewer over the head the way Johnson is here. Still, it's bracing to come across such a high-profile tentpole title that's not afraid to be this nakedly political. (Conservative Twitter is up in arms, to which I say boo-freakin'-hoo.) Back in Ahch-To, a more arresting battle of wills is taking place. A determined Rey refuses to stop trying to convince a stubborn Luke to train her in the ways of the Force. Their slow-to-build bond is the movie's beating heart. This battle is less between good and evil than an internal struggle for enlightenment. It leads to a series of flashbacks that might have come across as contrived in lesser hands, but Johnson conceives these past skeletons as a “Rashomon”-like puzzle. Something that seemed cut and dried is reexamined until all you see are shades of gray.  And that extends to the way Johnson approaches the “Star Wars” universe in general. He favors character development over pulse-pounding action (though two fights in particular are vibrantly staged). And he doesn't stop at “Rashomon.” “Jedi” is a top-to-bottom Akira Kurosawa lovefest. A climactic confrontation between the beleaguered Alliance and the First Order boasts a visual splendor that recalls “Kagemusha” and “Ran.” (All very fitting since, after all, “A New Hope” is a loose remake of Kurosawa's “The Hidden Fortress.”) One long shot even brings to mind a sword fight in Michael Curtiz's “The Adventures of Robin Hood.” But Johnson ends up biting off more than he can chew. He's juggling too many storylines, and takes too long to move the narrative forward. Fatigue sets in about three-quarters of the way in. He doesn't heed the lesson of the chapter “Jedi” often resembles, “The Empire Strikes Back.” That film, still the best “Star Wars.,” ended with a whopper of a cliffhanger. Johnson resists the urge to leave most of his strands unresolved, and as a result his film begins to feel unwieldy when it should be picking up momentum. At two and a half hours, it could have used a trim of at least 15 minutes. Much has also been made of “Jedi's” jarring tonal shifts. Johnson inserts broad humor, then abruptly makes things serious, then back again to goofy content. But the laughs feel less than a concession to “Star Wars'” younger fans than a peek into the filmmaker's own geeky sensibilities. In other words, you can criticize the uneven tone all you want, but it very rarely feels generic. Think of a competent “Harry Potter” installment, which shares this film's refusal to talk down to its audience,

And this is what ultimately elevates “The Last Jedi” above its more recent predecessors, even when it stumbles: a profound affection for these realms, coupled with a desire to shake things up.  The franchise, and Hollywood in general, could use some more of this “flawed” risk-taking. Which makes some devoted fans' resistance to this depiction of the Resistance all the more confounding, In the days since I saw it, I have gone from “really, guys, it's good, but not that good” to “really, guys, it's not nearly as bad as you make it sound.” But I'm sensing some of these dissenters will end up coming around. My gut tells me “The Last Jedi” will benefit from repeat viewings in ways that “The Force Awakens” and the inexplicably praised (in some circles) “Rogue One” do not. When it comes to pop cinema at this massive level, isn't it better for a movie to take Imperial-sized chances than just giving you what you want? I'll go with yes. DANCE: When they premiered Alexei Ratmansky's ""Swan Lake"" in 2022, the Miami City Ballet had a hit. Now, they are bringing it back. Cameron Basden has the preview."
"Aug 21, 2018",POSITIVE," Star Wars: The Last Jedi continues the (SPOILER FREE!!!) adventures of our popular band of heroes: Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) as well as baddies General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). When we last left, the long missing Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) rejoined the universe. That’s all you’re getting kids… you have to go see the film.  The movie comes from writer and director Rian Johnson, who is perhaps best known to audiences for his work on films like Looper and Brick. In November, news broke that Johnson will helm a brand new Star Wars trilogy currently in development stages at Lucasfilm.  While it seems like a tall order to discuss the film and avoid spoilers, Rian Johnson must be celebrated for his stunning work on The Last Jedi. Known for his unique story ideas, his innovative and creative scripts, and his interesting films, Johnson absolutely doesn’t disappoint with this movie.  From the opening crawl, Johnson not only sets the scene, but keeps audiences on their toes. Watching the delicate intricacies of his script play out on screen, it’s difficult to resist predicting where this will end up. However, you’ll be wrong. Johnson takes the narrative through its paces, weaving a complicated and fascinating story. Just when you think one thing is going to happen, the story shifts. Showing the flair of a talented writer and filmmaker, Johnson crafts the story with an experienced hand. Nothing feels jarring or set-up (“Oh! What a twist!”), and the film really doesn’t feel like it clocks in at (its actual runtime) of 152 minutes. After watching this movie, Johnson feels like the ideal candidate to not only create, but shape a brand new Star Wars saga.  In the weeks leading up to the film, predictions flooded social media about what The Last Jedi would feel like. Were we in-store for a shot-for-shot remake of Empire Strikes Back? Well, Johnson crafts an interesting and complicated tone, which makes the film decidedly his own. Particularly refreshing is his blending of humor into the inherent darkness in the plot. There are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments as the story develops, with everyone from Poe, Hux, Chewie, the Porgs and even Rey joining in on the fun. And for those worrying… no, the Porgs don’t take over the story, or feel particularly oppressive. Johnson definitely uses them sparingly, and to good effect.  To continue gushing, in this film Adam Driver shows that he’s so much more then the Girls hipster actor so many assumed he was (this reviewer included). The still young performer took interesting steps with his portrayal of villain Kylo Ren in the first film, and finds still more new and interesting places to take the character in this installment. In fact, by the time the ending credits roll, Driver has taken the character to some truly new, interesting and complicated places. His work throughout the second act is absolutely stellar, and Driver definitely stands-out in the talented cast.  However, the performances in the film are stellar all-around. The return of Luke Skywalker to the action feels like a return to form. Actor Mark Hamill puts forward a layered and interesting portrayal of his iconic character. They explore some fascinating arcs, and it must have been fun for the actor to delve into those places. Furthermore, Laura Dern is an interesting addition as Vice Admiral Holdo. The crafting of the character feels beautiful and fitting in taking the actress responsible for the iconic Dr. Sadler (for anyone familiar with Jurassic Park), and placing her next to the equally iconic General Leia. Finally, Carrie Fisher is everything she was and continues to stand for. Particular moments in the film feel bittersweet, but particularly well-crafted in celebration of the well-loved and much missed performer.  Finally, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a well-crafted and visually stunning sequel. In particular is the film’s work creating Supreme Leader Snoke. With characters like Steppenwolf and Thanos taking some heat in other cinematic universes, it’s nice to see one team absolutely nail the look of a computer generated character. Furthermore, the story introduces new and interesting locations, completely expanding the already rich and fleshed out universe. The crew at Disney and Lucasfilm most definitely have more in their pocket. The opportunities for the Star Wars franchise are seemingly boundless.  Speaking bluntly, even if this were a bad film, it would still kill at the box office. However, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a stellar entry to the iconic franchise. Fans of the series will most assuredly enjoy this movie, and have already likely purchased their tickets. However, there’s more to this film. If you stepped away from the franchise around the prequels, consider coming back for this one.  A film nerd from my earliest years watching Abbott and Costello, that eventually translated to a Master’s Degree in Film History. I spend my time working on my fiction projects in all their forms, as well as covering film and television."

"Aug 14, 2018",POSITIVE,"Whereas JJ Abrams's The Force Awakens delivered a nostalgic joy that focused on reigniting a legacy I grew to love and obsess over throughout the years, Rian Johnson instead creates a nostalgia towards my years of childhood imagination."
"Aug 14, 2018",POSITIVE,"With deep reverence for what has come before, Disney has proven that they aren't afraid to move the story forward."
"Aug 7, 2018",POSITIVE," Forty years after George Lucas took us to a galaxy far, far away, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the eight chapter in a continuing saga, takes us back to the universe we fell in love with as children and young adults and still finds a way to explore new ground and take on new ideas with confidence. When Return of the Jedi released in 1983, no one envisioned a return to the popular cinematic universe of George Lucas. Lucas was content with merchandising revenue and ancillary content. It wouldn’t be until 1999 that he felt the need (and the accompanying technology was there) to reboot the franchise and go back in time to explore what happened before Star Wars. Three lightly appreciated prequels later, audiences were frustrated and uncertain they wanted more content. Then Disney bought Lucasfilms and 10 years after Episode III, Episode VII, a continuance of the original saga, was underway. This time, loving detail has infused everything made. Lucas has removed himself from the entire creative process while others carry on with his creation. With The Last Jedi, director Rian Johnson steps away from his popular, though heavily flawed Looper and enters a universe that has far more at stake and a limitation on his creativity, if only a small one. Johnson wrote and directed this departure from the traditional middle-chapter, a sequel to The Force Awakens that almost feels like a stand alone film. All the elements audiences have grown to love are there: soaring music, plot twists, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), and Princess Leia (Carrie FIsher). Our heroes must skillfully navigate an Empire on the verge of annihilating the Resistance. While those two hash out his involvement in the coming war, ex-storm trooper Finn (John Boyega) and Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) along with Poe’s droid BB-8 and ship mechanic Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) embark on a side journey to locate and destroy the tracking device the Empire has placed on the Resistance ship. The main cast are all strong, playing characters they helped embody in the first film. Yet, newcomers Laura Dern as the resistance’s Vice Admiral Holdo and Benicio del Toro as professional thief DJ are the notable standouts. As the franchise presses on, it’s clear that bringing in new blood is giving the series a boost of creative energy. While Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a pale imitation of the 1977 original, The Last Jedi is a fresh take on the series, building off of and into the mythos with skill and energy. Johnson’s love of the material helps him infuse it with passion and excitement, which will translate easily to a friendly audience. While it might have too much information incorporated that might confuse those unfamiliar with any of the prior films, it seems unlikely that there are that many who aren’t already familiar. At this point, there are more fans of the franchise than there are non-fans. Those who watched the original films as kids are now taking their kids to see the continuation. Even those who aren’t tremendous fans of the Star Wars franchise can still sit down and enjoy this film alongside more devout audiences who take each moment and soak it in, relish it, and ultimately embrace it as a new part of the mythos that only grows in popularity and reverence with each passing year. This eighth episode is easily the best since the original trilogy and might even rank closer to the top thanks to its weighty issues, compassionate approach to humanity, and its ability to excite, thrill, and enrapture even when cutting a new path through the universe."
"Jul 27, 2018",NEUTRAL," I think ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" was a bad movie. That is a personal opinion, one with which other men and women of good will should feel comfortable disagreeing. I also think the people who have been harassing Kelly Marie Tran, John Boyega, Rian Johnson and other creative individuals who helped make ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" are racist, sexist and all-around deplorable human beings (and I use the term ""deplorable"" quite deliberately here). Before I get into the problem of the toxic nerd culture that has caused the harassment of ""The Last Jedi"" alums like actress Tran, however, I'd like to explain precisely why I think the movie itself was an epic misfire. Appropriately enough, the easiest way to explain my point is to compare ""The Last Jedi"" to the ""Breaking Bad"" antepenultimate episode ""Ozymandias,"" which, like ""The Last Jedi,"" was directed by Rian Johnson. Without spoiling the story, its purpose was to serve as the climax for all of the major characters viewers had gotten to know throughout the show — the moment when, for everyone from antiheroes Walter White and Jesse Pinkman to their adversary Hank Schrader, the proverbial chickens came home to roost. It was a powerful piece of television filmmaking and — because it was suitably epic while remaining rooted in what viewers had come to know and love (or hate) about the characters — felt like an appropriate culmination of their various story arcs. Frankly, I'd be shocked if it wasn't instrumental in landing Johnson his ""Star Wars"" gig. That said, ""Star Wars"" is not ""Breaking Bad,"" and the same narrative tricks that worked for the latter feel jarringly out of place in the former. (Johnson deserves to be commended for his boldness, but audacity is not the same thing as quality.) The problem with ""The Last Jedi"" is that it doesn't logically connect everything we saw from the previous movies with what happens in this one. As Mark Hamill himself pointed out, Luke Skywalker's (Hamill) abandonment of his belief in Jedi teachings directly contradicts his personality and actions from the original trilogy, and the backstory filled in here to explain his sudden turn is delivered in startlingly brief monologues instead of scenes that actually flesh out the character dilemmas they're meant to reveal. Because the explanation for Luke's loss of faith is critical to the film's plot, the perfunctory execution makes everything we're supposed to believe about his character's transformation feel unconvincing. While his scenes training Rey (Daisy Ridley) are beautifully done, they can't make up for the fact that the character performing the training feels less like Luke Skywalker than he does Johnson's own original creation with the Skywalker name slapped onto him. The other storyline isn't much better. In Plot B we see Finn (John Boyega) team up with a maintenance worker named Rose Tico (Tran) to help Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) circumvent the seemingly incompetent leadership of Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern). There are many problems here. First, Rose and Finn wind up abandoning their plan halfway through its execution for the flimsiest of reasons and, even worse, have all of their work rendered entirely moot by a betrayal from someone who it was blazingly obvious should never have been trusted in the first place. This is a shame, if for no other reason than the chemistry between Finn and Rose makes them easily the most likable and sympathetic characters in the film. Poe and Holdo have their charms as well — Poe is endearingly plucky and adventurous while Holdo has a quiet bravery and wisdom to her — but their conflict is marred by the fact that it winds up being pointless. After all the strategic Sturm und Drang between the two of them has subsided, it's hard to see how the Resistance didn't wind up back exactly where it started, despite Poe's and Holdo's various moments of character growth and/or sacrifice. It's much ado that adds up to, if not nothing, at least less than the sum of its parts. Of course, these are only my assessments. Given the opportunity, I would jump at the chance to have a respectful conversation with Johnson, who I am certain set out to make a wonderful movie, as well as the millions of people who loved ""The Last Jedi."" That's the thing about a work of art: It is perfectly OK to dislike it, even dislike it intensely (although my emotions toward ""The Last Jedi"" can be better characterized as ""disappointed"" than ""outraged""). I'm certain that Johnson has movies that he disliked and that the critics who defend ""The Last Jedi"" also have movies that they disliked, and I hope that they too could disagree with those films' fans without being disagreeable. It's called being civil — as well as remembering that there are issues way, way more important than whether or not a particular movie missed the mark. It's one that we've seen pop up before. The watershed moment, as Johnson himself observed in a tweet earlier this week, was the Gamergate scandal of 2014. On that occasion, feminist critics of video games and women in the gaming industry in general were singled out for harassment by thousands of gamers who deplored what they felt was an intrusion into their domain by left-wing ""social justice warriors."" They were particularly upset about attempts to criticize both games and the gaming industry as sexist, with writer Jenn Frank explaining in The Guardian that ""they feel they are at war with a group of left-leaning games writers and developers who they refer to as 'social justice warriors' – this is effectively anyone who has ever questioned the patriarchal nature of the games industry or the limited, often objectifying depiction of women."" Of course, the backlash of pop culture nerd bigotry was hardly limited to Gamergate. When the trailer for ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" revealed that one of the protagonists would be played by the African-British actor John Boyega, it led to a cry of outrage by many ""Star Wars"" fans. In 2016, there was a comparable outcry against the ""Ghostbusters"" reboot from the nerd community, with internet fans lashing out against a film they hadn't even seen (or at least hadn't seen prior to vehemently denouncing it) because it had replaced the traditionally all-male Ghostbusters cast with women. One year later, a so-called Comicsgate occurred that seemed to be sparked by a picture of female comics writers at Marvel going out for milkshakes. 1. Some fans felt outraged that pop culture spaces that they believed should be specifically white, straight and male — whether mediums like video games and comic books or specific franchises like ""Star Wars"" and ""Ghostbusters"" — had been compromised by the inclusion of people who weren't. 2. In order to reclaim these spaces for straight white men, they join likeminded people online and attempt to take down these properties by either (a) claiming that their outrage isn't because of racism, sexism or other forms of prejudice but rather because the developments that just so happen to be associated with minorities are ""ruining"" their medium/franchise of choice or (b) being explicit in the fact that their motivations are racist and sexist, usually by harassing their targets with slurs and threats. Sometimes they also do (a) and (b) at the same time, never mind the fact that (b) pretty much proves the lie in the premise of (a). 3. They act like the injured party when they are criticized for their behavior. This point is absolutely crucial to understand: They do not perceive of themselves as bullies, or as bigots, but rather they pose as aggrieved parties. In the best case scenarios, it is because they claim that something they've loved all of their life has been taken away from them; in the worst case scenarios, it's because they claim that pop culture is being used to attack them as straight white men (just look at the popularity of Jordan Peterson, who has described ""Frozen"" as ""propaganda"" because of its subversion of traditionally feminine narrative themes). Just to be clear: Not all of this toxic nerd entitlement is based in racism or sexism. Sometimes it's simply silly, like the ""Suicide Squad"" fans who complained about the critics on Rotten Tomatoes giving their beloved film a low score; other times it's more tragic, like George Lucas selling the ""Star Wars"" franchise to Disney because the fan community's vitriol toward him meant that it wasn't fun for him to make the movies anymore. 1. It must be accepted that content creators — whether they are writers, directors, actors, producers, developers or the lowly intern who gets the coffee — have a right to the basic respect afforded all other people. This is an absolutely inviolable principle. If you think a given movie or game or book was sub-par, fine. As a film critic, I'm certainly not going to pull my punches if I think an artist didn't meet my qualitative expectations. But there is a clear and obvious difference between saying that someone's artistic creation was bad and trying to inflict harm on that person for reasons that have nothing to do with their work and everything to do with your prejudices and sense of entitlement. There is never, ever any occasion in which the latter is acceptable. 2. The media needs to cover these issues more thoroughly. As Johnson observed in a different tweet discussing Gamergate, ""I think it was covered heavily but in a very niche corner of the media."" This seems to be the rule of thumb for all of these controversies, and while a case can be made for not giving trolls a bigger platform, that argument ignores the degree to which sunlight can be the best disinfectant. I'm going to close this article on that last point because, as a nerd myself, I remember being scorned as a child for my various obsessions (history, politics, science fiction literature, horror movies). One of the things that gave me comfort was the knowledge that, according to the archetypes that existed throughout media, I was at the very least someone worthy of sympathy — awkward and weird and annoying, to be sure (being autistic doesn't help), but at least respected as not only intelligent, but benign and fundamentally decent and in-touch with that special type of childlike enthusiasm that only the best adults can channel. That archetype is gone now, or at best dying. When the ""Ghostbusters"" reboot turned its villain into a sexist nerd stereotype, they weren't doing so to insult their fans (as many online commenters claimed) but to make a point about how a duality has emerged in the nerd community's image. After all, the four new Ghostbusters played by Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones, Melissa McCarthy and Kate McKinnon were all nerds as well, but they were the ones who stood by their passions in a way that tried to help other people rather than hurt them. That was the nerd archetype of old that the movie was trying to support; the angry, bitter nerd played by Neil Casey was the one that needed to be destroyed. Considering that I liked the ""Ghostbusters"" reboot (a verboten view among many nerds), I can't think of a better way to end this piece than by citing its message. Here is to hoping that it's a message other nerds will follow — even if they dislike the ""Ghostbusters"" movie itself, as they have every right to do. Matthew Rozsa is a staff writer at Salon.

"Jun 15, 2018",POSITIVE," I admit my bias and my sentimentality. For me, the latest installments in the Star Wars saga have been about women, about what I will always believe was the sexism and patriarchy of the 1970s keeping a fascinating character, Leia, in a supporting role, about a princess re-emerging as a General, about an orphaned girl fighting and holding her own against a trained Sith apprentice. Since this and the prominence of PoCs were what I wanted, The Last Jedi satisfied. This installment continues the examination of inner conflict that The Force Awakens began. Rey is kneeling at the foot of a reluctant and reclusive Luke Skywalker. Patricidal Kylo Ren is rent in two by what should have been his definitive turn to the dark side. General Organa is continuing her lifelong mission of subverting oppressive regimes while wrestling with the idea that her son has turned. Finn is still a First Order deserter who has to battle his me-first-and-f*ck-all-y’all-I’m-saving-myself instinct. Luke is still out here battling the same demons he’s been battling since the first installment: himself and all of his big, huge feelings. Poe Dameron, too, is battling his impulses to achieve his goals. What the movie does well is link each of these individual journeys to the larger over-arching narrative. The cogs fit well. By the end of the movie, most of these characters reach new personal milestones or realizations, some more satisfying than others. Inner conflict becomes a window to loss, hubris, and fear. The audience is asked to think about failure and what it means in the trajectory of a life, of a war, of a government. It seemed, at times, particularly poignant to examine how we fight back against failure in the current shitshow that is our government. How does one rebel against all odds? What is the personal responsibility of each of us in response to the call? These are questions the franchise has been directly addressing at least since Padmé. This installment is unrelenting in that regard while, somehow, simultaneously retaining a dry humor that acts as a pressure valve. This humor does not just come from the expected characters like Poe or Finn, though it does come from them. There is a scene in which Luke and Rey are talking about the nature of the Force. It may be the funniest few seconds in the entire franchise. There are small, beautiful moments scattered throughout the film like that. They reminded me that while the nerdom is serious business, as evidenced by the massive line and casual cosplay in the theatre, it is, at its heart, entertainment. In the theatre I was in, we laughed, we clapped, we cheered, we awwwww-ed, and I heard more than one person admit to crying during the film. I didn’t, but I came close watching General Organa. We know Leia, though untrained, is sensitive to the Force. We also know that this was Carrie Fisher’s last reprisal of her iconic role. I don’t think the passing of the (strong woman) torch was meant to be this literal, but death rarely cares about our intentions so it was. Fisher, as Leia, got to see Rey pursue her training with Luke. This was not bloodline nepotism, but pure talent. I got to see a world where daughters do not understand that there was a time when all the Jedi were men, were white, were not them. And, yes, though I’d love a movie in which the Jedi are all #blackgirlmagic and light sabers, I cannot pretend that Leia, as a princess and as a general—especially where those Venn diagram circles overlap—was not inspiring to me as a child and as a woman. I think the emotional weight of this legacy, and of others, was purposefully and deftly communicated through the use of silence. When the noise drops out of a theatre of hundreds, you feel it. If the Force is about balance, and all of the movies have been, on some level, about seeking that balance, then the decision to embrace both the state of the art sound system and the quiet is a wise choice. There are things I did not like about the movie: a forced tension between characters, a moment when I questioned the internal logic of the universe we were in, and an overly didactic subplot. Even though these things are outweighed by what I enjoyed, they are worth mentioning. There are two simultaneous, intertwined plots happening: white people exploring their own inner lives, and PoCs trying to solve real-world problems in real-world time. Yes, I’m oversimplifying, but this is, at its heart a space western and so I feel justified. John Boyega’s Finn and Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose risk their lives trying to get the MacGuffin while Rey, in a number of ways, explores the Force on an island with Skywalker. Yes, they are still on the island even though stakes were high (looks at Roy Moore election results and deep sighs). Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron explores much of the same territory that the franchise covered with Han Solo. Yes, he’s handsome. Yes, he’s a lovable rogue. Yes, he has a heart of gold and poor impulse control. No, he doesn’t respect female authority in any way whatever even in the face of evidence that he should simply fall back. I was also somewhat annoyed by the buddy-cop-turned-possible-romantic-tension between Finn and Rose. This is the Speed principle. As a young Sandra Bullock said in the classic 1994 film Speed, “relationships that start under intense circumstances, they never last.” And, no, Finn and Rose aren’t Facebook-official or anything, but the movie seeks to sow the seeds of attraction. Why? So Rey can be a monk? [deep sigh]. So we have to navigate the sexual politics and tension in the next installment? [deeper sigh]. So we can watch Rey and Finn repeat Anakin and Padmé’s clandestine relationship minus, of course, the pedophiliac grooming? [deepest of sighs]."
"May 22, 2018",POSITIVE," There are a lot of good things I expected from Star Wars: The Last Jedi, but nuance wasn’t one of them. You can usually depend on this franchise to deliver zoomy action steered by easily recognizable good guys and bad guys, their motivations untainted by complexity. The possible exception would be The Empire Strikes Back, and The Last Jedi writer/director Rian Johnson is obviously trying to evoke that film here. Luckily, The Last Jedi is not a reboot or recreation of The Empire Strikes Back, the way The Force Awakens was of A New Hope. Jedi turns our characters into multi-faceted people and takes the series in new and unexpected directions. Without giving away any of the plot, I can say that The Last Jedi’s greatest strength comes from its characters—and of course the actors who play them. Instead of giving us legendary heroes whose main job is to propel the plot, The Last Jedi focuses on our protagonists’ struggles with the same everyday problems that all sentient creatures face. They are conflicted, disappointed, and unsure what to do. They go on wild goose chases. They do the wrong thing, or the right thing for the wrong reasons. In other words, they feel realistically ordinary. Luke actually makes fun of his mythical reputation when the wide-eyed Rey (Daisy Ridley) begs for his help (Mark Hamill is in fine form here as a sarcastic old dude). The grand arc of the Star Wars series is about how the scrappy Rebels fight the yoke of Imperial oppression. But at the same time, the movies have always revolved around aristocratic families and their precious dynastic bloodlines. What sets The Last Jedi apart, ultimately, is that we've finally got a team of Rebels who feel like members of a nascent democracy. They're mostly Plebeians, not Patricians, regular people who rely on each other to rise up and challenge an authoritarian military power that’s galactic in scope. At a time when the rebellion is on the brink of annihilation, it's refreshing to see the franchise abandon its fixation on princesses and Skywalkers. Sure, they're around—both Carrie Fisher as Leia and Adam Driver as Kylo Ren are standouts—but increasingly our attention is on the gleefully self-identified ""Rebel scum"" like Finn (John Boyega) and engineer Rose (newcomer Kelly Marie Tran). Sometimes this makes it feel like we're trying to follow too many characters, especially in the middle of the film. But The Last Jedi delivers enough desperate action and saber-smashing to make us feel like there's always something bigger at stake. Our rebels are battling for a true Republic, where ex-janitors can stand on equal footing with generals. As the action unfolds, there are plot twists you might not expect. And when the camera looks deep into Kylo Ren's eyes... let's just say it's actually creepy in a way that goes beyond the usual ""guy in a black cape"" theatrics. Long after you're done with your popcorn, you'll find yourself wondering what the real difference is between the Light Side and the Dark Side. Despite a few meandering scenes, The Last Jedi is successful both as an edge-of-your-seat adventure and as a political fable that feels almost timeless. The Last Jedi continues The Force Awakens' preoccupation with passing the torch, as Luke and Leia must learn to take a back seat to Finn, Rey, Poe, and the brave engineer Rose. As I said earlier, this film is as much about character as it is about plot—some early reviews have accused it of being aimless because the action mostly focuses on a couple of harebrained Rebel schemes. The Last Jedi is, in fact, a very dark film. It's reminiscent in some ways of the 2003 Battlestar Galactica miniseries where humanity is being rapidly blown to bits by cylons who can track them anywhere. As the action begins, we discover that the First Order has figured out a way to engineer the Rebels' certain defeat—unless Rose and Finn can pull off a desperate trick. Meanwhile, Rey is with Luke, trying to learn as much as she can from the Jedi Master as he decides whether to rejoin Leia and the rest of the resistance. It's all relatively straightforward until the film starts building on the twisted connection between Rey and Kylo Ren that we saw in The Force Awakens. Kylo Ren is what Anakin should have been in episodes 1-3. He's magnetic and repulsive, and Driver skillfully plays him as balanced between infantile rage and nihilistic calm. Rey is a perfect foil for him, with her gravitas and clear sense of justice. We've seen good characters struggle before with temptation by the Dark Side. But I don't recall ever seeing an evil character struggle with temptation by the Light the way Kylo Ren does. Sure, there was the turning of Darth Vader—but that felt like a deathbed confession. We never got to see what Darth Vader would do after turning back to the Light. The Last Jedi teases us with this possibility for Kylo Ren, just as it teases us with Rey's inner darkness. Rey and Kylo Ren's evolving relationship raises intriguing philosophical questions that lurk beneath the surface of the action. Are we witnessing a transformation of the Force itself? What if Light and Dark need each other to survive? What if the Dark Side actually has something to offer that isn't just evil and horror? These questions remain subtext, and indeed it's possible to enjoy The Last Jedi without mulling over any spiritual conundrums at all. There's plenty to enjoy just in the movie's epic worldbuilding. We get a closer look at the power structure of the First Order, but we also get to goof around on Luke's Jedi retreat island with its stunning vistas and weird wildlife. There are ocean cows, milked by Luke in one of the film's many comic moments; and of course there are the delightful porgs, already a fan favorite, who look like a cross between guinea pigs and penguins run through a Meitu filter. Some of this worldbuilding has an edge to it. When Finn and Rose go to the luxurious casino city Canto Bight, frequented by the galaxy's wealthiest arms dealers, we get to see another side of the war. Here, guests with no loyalty to Leia or Snoke dine in gilded rooms while slaves live in the stables. Their only ruler is profit. It feels like director Johnson is taking us on a frenetic cruise through his vision of the Star Wars universe, which makes sense when you consider that he recently signed a deal with Disney to create his own, original Star Wars trilogy unconnected to the main storyline. While some viewers will delight in the new worlds we see in The Last Jedi, others may find these plotlines boring or pointless. We learn a lot about Finn and Rose's back stories and see why Hux (Domhnall Gleeson, camping it up) is pissed at Kylo, but these bits are admittedly less vital to the plot of Kylo Ren's true relationship to Luke—and the real story about Rey's parents. Plus, what about the freaking resistance? There are definitely moments when we simply lose sight of what's going on in the war because we're watching BB-8 deal with a drunk alien who thinks the little droid is a slot machine. That said, The Last Jedi is a challenging and satisfying movie on many levels. It's fluffy and diverting at times but ultimately delivers a much-needed message about how hope will always reignite the resistance against political failure and galactic chaos."

"Apr 13, 2018",POSITIVE," So much happens in these new Star Wars films, and at such a ferocious clip, you’d think Lucasfilm had enough material for another whole trilogy. (Many stand-alone “Star Wars stories” are planned, including Solo in May.) Star Wars: The Last Jedi is also, at two hours and thirty-two minutes, the longest of the nine movies thus far, and deep into the second hour it can feel a little draining. There’s some stuff that feels extraneous (the whole Canto Bight sequence, which seems to exist to set up a new Lando-like character played by Benicio del Toro), and the cycle of attack and retreat — mostly retreat — gets a bit monotonous. But writer/director Rian Johnson pulls it together for the finale, unfolding on a planet with white salt coating red soil. The tracks of vehicles and feet scoring out crimson marks in the ground, as if slicing and drawing blood, has a poetry that matches the binary sunset of Tatooine, an image stirringly echoed here. In The Last Jedi, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) returns, only to tell us and his student Rey (Daisy Ridley) that he and everything he once stood for deserve to die. This is a real “there are no heroes” movie, although not in a nihilistic way. I was amused to see that Luke, all these years later, is excoriating himself for the hubris — the smugness, really — he showed in Return of the Jedi. Hero myths of the sort that fed Star Wars in the first place, we are informed, are lies. There are only flawed people (or aliens, whatever) trying to resist tyranny. Luke says to us, in effect, “You grew up looking up to me. You were wrong, but I was more wrong to accept that reverence. The fact is that I am a failure.” He’s wrong there, too — one of the movie’s gentler points is that someone who fails (meaning all of us) is not a failure. A failure is a failure, and victory proceeds by small and not always satisfying degrees. The plot has what’s left of the Resistance, led by General Leia (Carrie Fisher in a moving swan song), running from the relentless forces of the First Order, led by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and his soul-divided apprentice Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), son of Leia and Han Solo, one-time student of Luke. There’s an awful lot of back and forth, people hopping into ships and revving off for here and there, a good amount of pew pew and lightsaber hum, but the meat of the movie is a young man torn between good and evil, a young woman who feels he can turn to the good side, and an old man who has been there, done that, and takes a lot of convincing that any of it means anything. Johnson and his team (cinematographer Steve Yedlin, editor Bob Ducsay) stage the action cleanly and sometimes with a cathartic swoop of exhilaration, but a good deal of it is the same pew pew and hum we’ve been seeing for forty years. The currency here is the people. Hotshot pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) taunting First Order General Hux (“Hi, I’m holding for a General Hugs”) is a risky but gratifying way to open the movie; returning stormtrooper-turned-rebel Finn (John Boyega) and newcomer Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), zipping around trying to crack into a tracking device, make a fun team in perpetual motion. The Vietnamese-American Tran is one of many women and/or people of color taking their places at the foreground of these new Star Wars movies, upsetting racist fanboys but pleasing everyone else. A most welcome addition is Laura Dern as purple-haired Vice Admiral Holdo, whose command is gentle but firm — she bats away the indignation of hothead Poe without raising her voice. Whoever decided to bring the warmhearted, levelheaded Dern into the Star Wars universe deserves a good cigar. Ultimately, The Last Jedi speaks for the strength of a united front against imperial aggression, and forget about elevating a few people to godhood — and that includes the villains, too. The final image leaves us with the assurance that young people tired of injustice will pick up the ball their elders dropped; the movie was filmed and released before the Parkland shooting and its subsequent students’ movement, but seems to anticipate it. The Star Wars universe is starting to mirror our own in that it is re-evaluating its holy trinity of heroes — Luke, Leia and Han — and advising their worshipers to look to themselves for rescue, redemption, and faith. The Force (whose power no longer seems to depend on the “midichlorians” of George Lucas’ doofus prequels) shares with Zen Buddhism a cleansing disregard for icons (foreshadowed when Rey hands Luke his father’s lightsaber and he tosses it over his shoulder): If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him."
"Apr 5, 2018",POSITIVE," Rian Johnson's Star Wars: The Last Jedi didn't work for me the first time I saw it. It wasn't the movie I expected -- a fault of mine, and not of the movie (naturally). The story's desire to subvert expectations at virtually every turn rubbed me the wrong way. The repeatedly false endings aggravated me, as did Johnson's deliberate attempt to reverse virtually everything we -- the collective fanbase -- thought a Star Wars movie should deliver. Luke's lightsaber? Not important. Rey's parents? A total dead end. Supreme Leader Snoke? We hardly knew you. I thought Johnson mishandled a lot of the tantalizing plot threads that J.J. Abrams established in The Force Awakens. Now that Star Wars: The Last Jedi is out on Blu-ray and streaming, I was able to finally settle in for a second viewing, and what I discovered was the movie Rian Johnson always meant for me to see, and not the movie I thought I was seeing on a first pass. There's a definite distinction, and one that doesn't always crystalize on a first pass... particularly for a movie like The Last Jedi, which we -- as entertainment journalists -- spend months, and even years, writing about as we lead up to release date. The subversion happens almost immediately, when Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) accepts the lightsaber that Rey (Daisy Ridley) has traveled great distances to return to him... and he tosses it over his shoulder as if it carries as much meaning as the X-Wing fighter he's allowed to sink to the bottom of the water off the coast of Ahch-To. It continued as we learned the supposed truth about Rey's heritage, and the importance of Snoke to the overall trilogy being told here. When I first watched Star Wars: The Last Jedi, I saw too many of these scenes as preordained ""boxes"" that I needed to see checked off. And I found myself disagreeing with almost all of the answers that Rian Johnson was giving his audience -- was giving me, personally. How could Rey come from no one special? How could Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) dispose of his mentor, Snoke (Andy Serkis) in dramatic but still unceremonious fashion... leaving far too many unanswered questions. And why is Luke behaving this way? On a second pass, however, it's easier to see these sequences in the actual context of the movie that's playing out, and in truth, they fit. Rian Johnson knows that they fit. He wrote the damned movie. But they don't fit the way that Star Wars fans might initially expect, and that's jarring. So much of Star Wars: The Last Jedi is about eliminating the past, about starting over. ""It's time for the Jedi to end,"" Luke laments, though he screams out loud, still hesitating, when Yoda himself burns down the tree and ignites the dwelling with the sacred texts. Luke wants to destroy the past. He knows it's mandatory so that the Resistance can actually evolve. But he's not able to. It's what he loves. It's all he knows. Isn't this Rian Johnson speaking directly to the Star Wars faithful? When Kylo tells Rey that they can eliminate the Resistance and the First Order, and start anew, how do you not step back and think of this in terms of the future of Star Wars, as a storytelling vehicle. The Skywalker Saga is ending. But with deals in place with creators like Jon Favreau, Rian Johnson, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, you realize that letting the past go only means embracing the future. And the future can be bright. On a first pass, I also was so caught up in the seemingly important ""answers"" in Star Wars: The Last Jedi that I totally missed so many of the BOLD and sweeping choices that Rian Johnson made to this mythology. He gave Luke the heroic sendoff that the iconic character deserved, able to assist the Rebels one last time as he confronted his one mistake, the disappointed Ben Solo. He established strong new voices, sacrificed important characters, painted himself into a bit of an unexpected corner with Leia (given the passing of Carrie Fisher), and spread the seeds of rebellion to the next generation of Star Wars fans -- both on the screen and off -- knowing that it's them, not us, who will carry the baton of Star Wars fandom for years to come. Does it all work? Absolutely not. Flying Space Leia is still a bizarre choice. The special effects in Canto Bight are embarrassingly unfinished (though that detour isn't as obnoxious), and for the life of me, I don't understand the choice Benicio Del Toro is making in his performance. But on a second pass, the questionable was extremely overpowered by the bold and the courageous, and I saw Star Wars: The Last Jedi through a different prism. I connected with it differently. The movie didn't change. But I did. And I'm thankful for it. Sean O’Connell is a journalist and CinemaBlend’s Managing Editor.

"Mar 22, 2018",POSITIVE," If there’s one thing that Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi proves, it is that the criticism that the franchise initiated by George Lucas’ groundbreaking 1977 film is not serious sci-fi, but a sordid soap opera set in space.  Amidst the fascinating aliens, the neon-colored lasers, and planets beats an overextended tale that relies heavily on the broadest of emotions. By fully embracing this, Johnson has created a sequel that feels the most delightfully intimate in the series even if it is still unabashedly sprawling, hugely spectacular, and unapologetically commercial. Opening with an expected space battle where the Resistance, headed by Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), is outnumbered by the New Order, The Last Jedi seems like it is headed towards a generic path – and it is.  Johnson wades through the battle the same way his predecessor J.J. Abrams did, and Irvin Kershner and Lucas before him, with a mix of a little bit of witty humor, bite-sized combat strategy, curveball tension, and a whole lot of eye-popping special effects. Immediately after the ice-breaking intro, the film proceeds to lay down the very tough business of uniting the stories of the trilogy’s newly introduced protagonists.  Rey (Daisy Ridley) has just met Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in a remote island in a remote planet in a remote galaxy and is trying her best to convince the disgruntled Jedi to help the Resistance. The few Resistance survivors, now headed by icy substitute leader Holdo (Laura Dern), is being chased by an armada of New Order ships. This prompts former Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega), reckless pilot Poe (Oscaar Isaac), and newcomer Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) to make their way to a planet that’s famous for its extravagant casinos to recruit a code-breaker who will thwart the enemy ship’s tracking system, or something to that effect. The Last Jedi struggles to weave together the disparate plotlines, and it becomes very apparent that the film is juggling too many characters and their stories all at once.  Thankfully, Johnson has the sense to ground the epic, essentially stripping the tale of any of the grandiosity that Abrams inflicted on The Force Awakens (2015). The characters of The Last Jedi are all humbled. They all reveal immaturities, stark propensities for failure, and weaknesses that really feel profound within the belatedly envisioned arc in the Star Wars canon that involves the dismantling of heroes and legends, turning them into persons defined not by their glorious pasts but by their present conflicts. This allows him to stage the most pleasurable of surprises when the forces of good manage to etch the littlest of victories, and in turn, to create a more tremendous emotional upheaval when that victory is suddenly uprooted. True to its soap opera roots, the film relies on grand reveals and operatic gestures.  The film’s most memorable sequences are the ones that you can see from a mile away, simply because Star Wars has always been an exploiter of twists and curveballs, but is presented in such a lurid, florid, and vivid sort of way that you can’t help but be swayed by the mix of emotional and visual pageantry. The spectacular rumble set in a crimson-walled hall is perhaps one of the franchise’s most thrilling set-pieces, one where the sentimental heft of the proceeding that led to the fight is brilliantly staggered, up to the very last reverberating light-saber swing.  There is really nothing novel about Johnson’s take, nothing that will push The Last Jedi to be anything more than an episode, thrilling and touching as it may be. "
"Mar 8, 2018",POSITIVE," In Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Jedi wannabe Rey (Daisy Ridley) strives to compel Jedi hermit Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to teach her about the Force. Meanwhile, the fascist First Order, spearheaded by Darth Vader manqué Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), struggles to quash the Resistance, led by Luke’s twin, General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). By the end, whether the Resistance can restore moral balance to the universe remains in doubt—but there’s no question that writer-director Johnson brings a surprising new equilibrium to the Star Wars franchise. The Last Jedi is refreshingly youthful yet also stirringly mature. Johnson has infused what could have been just another retread with elastic humor, visual luster and vitality, and a slow-burning passion. (At times it burns a tad too slow: two-thirds through its jam-packed 152 minutes, I felt the need for a 7th-inning stretch.) Despite a jury-rigged subplot about disabling a First Order tracking program that can follow Resistance vehicles through hyperspace, nearly every bout of action takes us closer to the brink of exciting revelations about the Force and its believers. The movie goes all-out with a potent array of cat-and-mouse chases (some in space, some inside spaceships), a thrilling samurai-inspired fight in the deep-crimson throne room of Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), and an eye-popping jaunt through the casino and prison of an ultra-decadent gambling planet known as Canto Bight. As the movie careens from one splashy set piece to the next, its most unlikely feat is that it amplifies our connection to pop icons Luke and Leia and a slew of more recent acquaintances. These include X-wing fighter jock Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), here a cocky, take-charge warrior learning how to lead, and former Storm Trooper Finn (John Boyega), an innately righteous man with no traditions to fall back on—he stumbles and improvises his way into valor. One freshly minted hero, a mechanic named Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), blows into the movie with a fan’s enthusiasm, a can-do spirit, and bracing undercurrents of proletarian rebellion. As bold and idealistic as she is practical, she may be the most rousing figure in the bunch. She starts out revering Resistance heroes, then turns into one herself by doing what comes naturally. With chugging energy and sudden freshets of emotion, Tran (an American of Vietnamese heritage) delivers a carpe diem performance. Space-waif Rey, as played by Ridley, already swept us into her cosmic identity crisis in J.J. Abrams’s hit-or-miss pastiche, Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015). Rey’s quest to discover her lineage and the secrets of her powers niftily re-set the Star Wars canon both for novices and longtime followers. Johnson doesn’t fray the bond Ridley forged with the audience. Her storyline begins where it left off, as Rey confronts Luke on his starkly beautiful island. Bearded, sunken-eyed, and weathered, heftier and more muscular than in his youth, Hamill has become a magnificent camera subject. Always an underrated actor, he wears Luke’s legend lightly as he matches Ridley’s fierceness and commitment, body and soul. Just as Rey’s internal confusions pour through the urgent expressions on Ridley’s open face, Hamill’s grizzled looks and scowling mien convey a self-immolating intensity. On her own, Ridley is such a consummate actor that she makes Rey’s moments of impotence and despair as dynamic as her violent outbursts. At one psychological low point that’s also a cinematic apex, she and Johnson rejuvenate a tired hall-of-mirrors concept. Rey’s gestures get mimicked in multiple and successive reflections, so that a snap of her fingers ricochets for seconds down the corridors of our minds. What’s daring about The Last Jedi is that Luke now regards Jedi traditions as mere vanities. In his weary, bitter view, the Jedi mystique causes people to think that the Force is a set of superpowers that only Jedi can channel, instead of being an unseen energy that connects all organic matter. Luke’s anger and resentment stem from his guilt over failing Kylo Ren as a teacher, when Kylo was just a stripling called Ben Solo, Han and Leia’s son. Driver’s Kylo moves like a dark cloud over those who once valued or loved him, or anyone who considers him redeemable—like Rey. The Force joins Kylo and Rey repeatedly in abrupt psychic connections, sometimes prodding them to test their powers and very identities against each other. In a movie filled with extravagant action sequences set in breathtaking locales, Johnson generates maximum tension from the mental and spiritual tugs of war between Driver’s moody Kylo and Ridley’s steadfast Rey, who is broadminded to a fault. In these scenes, concepts like a “rupture” or “imbalance” in the Force grow viscerally real. All good movies have their own version of the Force. We critics call it “directorial vision.” Johnson had it in his first film, Brick (2005), and it has come back here as strong as ever. It isn’t a matter of pulling off camera moves that reveal an auteur’s soul or establish a creative signature. It’s about a writer-director juggling every element of story and production so they drop into place. In an unexpectedly moving moment during the first pitched space battle, a pilot plummets into her bomb bay to see what’s stalling her payload. Johnson salutes her daring and self-sacrifice with a heartbreaking close-up. We can’t tell why we’re touched so deeply by a woman we haven’t had the chance to get to know. But the performance and the structure of the scene, as well as the shooting and editing, provoke a soulful response, and when the payoff arrives, it’s immense. She turns out to be somebody’s sibling in a movie that both celebrates and excoriates relations in every category, including sons and mothers, blood brothers and real sisters. In the world of publicity clichés, every new Star Wars director has been a fan since childhood and had fun each day on the set. I’m sure that’s true of Rian Johnson, but he tempers his affection with an ironic awareness of the franchise. He puts air quotes around the cuteness of the cuddly creatures known as porgs. He knows that adorable creatures are an essential part of the Star Wars marketing blitz, but he often treats them just as cruelly as Joe Dante did his Gremlins. On the other hand, the animals known as “farthiers”—huge horse/camel hybrids with faces like thin lambs—are pure action poetry. And the crystal foxes that roam a planet covered in salt might have loped out of a fever dream. Star Wars: The Last Jedi may not be perfect, but the need to accept imperfection and keep going becomes one of the movie’s themes. The movie is about viewing failures like Luke’s with Kylo as part of an honest education. It’s about mentorship that’s invigorating rather than smothering. It’s also about knowing when it’s time to leave the stage—and how to make that exit. Fisher’s elder statesman turn as Leia, complete with cane, is poignant partly because her acting is so economical. Her swift efficiency can be funny, as when she stuns Poe right after he greets her, or inspirational, as when she brusquely indicates that the same fighter is ready for promotion. Fisher’s posthumous appearance here soars as high as Harry Dean Stanton’s did in Lucky. This movie has become a fitting swansong for a rara avis.

"Mar 2, 2018",POSITIVE," Aunque la resistencia le dio un golpe masivo a la Primera Orden, estos no pudieron evitar el resurgimiento de la organización y aun con más poder. En la primera secuencia, los rebeldes son perseguidos y acorralados por el general Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) y Lord Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). A la flota de la general Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) parece haberle llegado su última hora. Pero el temerario piloto Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) ya tiene un plan sobre cómo derrotar al poderoso enemigo. Al mismo tiempo, la nueva recluta de la rebelión, Rey (Daisy Ridley), esta con el legendario Maestro Jedi Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) esperando no sólo ser instruida en el poder de la fuerza, sino también con el fin de descubrir quiénes son sus padres. Una vez que termina la primera batalla, la película se divide en tres historias paralelas, lo que definitivamente no le sirve de nada. Tenemos la trama alrededor de Finn (John Boyega) y Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) la que en gran medida es superflua y lleva la película mínimamente. La ya mencionada de Rey y Luke y el juego del gato y ratón que mantienen los rebeldes con las tropas de la Primera Orden. En general, las tres historias presentan una acción continua una de la otra, y de todos modos, solo la trama alrededor de Rey, Ben o Kylo Ren y Luke Skywalker resulta ser realmente interesante y tiene algunas buenas sorpresas guardadas. El choque entre Rey y Ben marca el momento más emocionante de la película y representa un verdadero punto culminante. Aunque este clímax habría funcionado bien como final, ""The Last Jedi"" no termina (desafortunadamente) después de esto. Es seguido por otros 40 minutos, con  baches, en los que los héroes se reúnen y tienen que pelear una batalla final. Sin embargo, la película pierde un poco de su trazabilidad aquí, cuando los personajes, las fuerzas y las explosiones siempre aparecen exactamente donde se necesitan para la trama. Puedes amar o no a la saga, pero una cosa es indiscutible: ‘’Star Wars: Episodio VII : The Force Awakens"" fue el evento de película en 2015. Dado que algunos registros se rompieron en serie con esta película, no sorprendió a nadie. No es de extrañar, pues incluso en circunstancias normales, una nueva parte de la saga habría despertado el mismo interés. Y aquí las circunstancias eran todo menos normal. Finalmente pudimos saber qué había sido de los héroes de la primera trilogía y conocimos a nuevos personajes. JJ Abrams fue extremadamente hábil para apelar a la nostalgia de los fanáticos mayores. No solo pudimos ver a Luke, Leia y Han más de 30 años después, sino que también habían tantas alusiones y referencias como si uno hubiera desenterrado un viejo anuario. En retrospectiva, fue un poco exagerado, con tantas referencias y situaciones, que nos hicieron sentir estar viendo una copia de “Star Wars: A New Hope”. Ahora llega “The Last Jedi”. El bombo puede ser un poco más débil en general, pero al menos los fanáticos han anticipado ansiosamente la parte central de la nueva trilogía. Después de todo, ""Episode 7"" había traído muchas cosas nuevas con todas las repeticiones y preguntas sin respuesta. ¿Qué ha estado haciendo Luke todos estos años? ¿Quiénes son los padres de Rey? ¿Cómo se ve el misterioso Snoke en la vida real? De hecho, Rian Johnson (Looper, 2012) brinda una respuesta a todas estas preguntas. Simplemente no son necesariamente las respuestas que se esperaban. La gran fortaleza de la octava parte es también como juega con las expectativas de la audiencia. En un momento él la satisface, en el siguiente lo pone todo patas arriba. Por supuesto, aquí los recuerdos de “Empire Strikes Back”, en el que también el aprendiz es el joven protagonista con un viejo maestro, son palpables. El hecho de que el alumno de antaño ahora esté a cargo aquí cierra el arco. Al mismo tiempo, sin embargo, esta constelación en el caso de descendientes tardíos se desvía significativamente de lo que sucedió en 1980 en Dagobah. Además de las escenas oscuras, que no están fuera de lugar en una película de terror, Johnson se dedica al abismo emocional. Estos son los momentos más emocionantes de la película, sobre todo por el elenco: Hamill se muestra en plena forma aquí, las actuaciones conjuntas de Ridley y Driver también son emocionantes. Si bien se ha realizado un excelente trabajo en estas áreas y la película se recibe eufóricamente, esto es solo la mitad de la historia. Después de todo, “The Last Jedi” también tenía que contar qué estaba pasando con los otros personajes. Y aquí están las muchas debilidades que plagan la película de Johnson. Para dar a Rey y Luke la oportunidad de pasar un poco más de tiempo juntos y encontrarse, el director decidió simplemente detener el segundo capítulo. El surgimiento de la Primera Orden, el colapso de la República, la aniquilación de la resistencia… todo esto se cuenta en el texto de desplazamiento icónico. La película dura dos horas y media, más que cualquier otra parte de la saga, y sin embargo, es la que tiene menos que decir. Lo que sucede aquí, por ejemplo, habría funcionado en la serie Star Wars Rebels. Muchas de las situaciones se sienten forzadas e innecesarias ( por ejemplo, la aventura de Finn y Rose, me parece innecesaria). “Empire Strikes Back” (1980) presenta una óptica diferente a una primera parte que revoluciona el cine. Al menos teníamos la impresión de que realmente la historia estaba avanzando y que los personajes se estaban desarrollando. La historia más interesante sin dudas, es el aura que rodea a Rey y su relación con Luke y Kylo, ya lo demás es redundante y algo aburrido. Se siente que el director no sabía qué hacer con Finn, mientras que Poe es degradado a un temerario sin cerebro, BB-8 es solo un alivio cómico, y la nueva miembro de la resistencia Rose Tico  es un personaje de esos que hemos visto alguna vez. El general Hux , esta mutado de un déspota fascista a ser un personaje que raya en lo caricaturesco, todo un desperdicio.  Claro, el humor siempre ha existido en Star Wars. La trilogía original tuvo momentos graciosos. Las precuelas también. En ""Episode 7"" y ""Rogue One"" se permitieron varios chistes. La presencia de chistes no está mal per se, en realidad son necesarios en este tipo de aventuras, pero en algunos momentos eran innecesarios. Para los fanáticos, por supuesto, la película es imprescindible, por supuesto, para rendir homenaje a la difunta Carrie Fisher del año pasado. Pero la película no resultó ser la obra maestra anticipada, sino ""solo"" un buen cuento de hadas de la ciencia ficción que habla mucho sobre el. ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" es una película para los amantes ya existentes, y en su mayoría aquellos que, para una inmersión renovada en el mundo de estos guerreros espaciales, también aceptan que la historia por sí misma no es demasiado fuerte. Llama mi atención el extraordinario diseño de vestuario que presenta “The Last Jedi”, la impecabilidad de nuevos diseños es impresionante y con claras referencias a la cultura oriental, así mismo, el diseño de exteriores y batallas mantienen una coordinación armoniosa de acuerdo a la narrativa. ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" confirma por primera vez los temores de que un ritmo narrativo a la larga puede llegar a ser algo monótono, mostrando que el carisma de los actores funciona y los efectos se transmiten tan perfectamente, que las fallas nos importan poco, pero no dejan de ser palpables. La aparición de un personaje clásico (uno de mis favoritos), puso una sonrisa en mi rostro acompañado de lágrimas de nostalgia por un cuento de hadas, que es y será eterno para muchos, claro, incluyéndome.

"Feb 26, 2018",NEGATIVE," Si hay un mérito que destacar en The Last Jedi -el más reciente capítulo de la saga de Star Wars- es su espíritu transgresor a los convencionalismos de la mitología original creada por George Lucas. No en menos de una ocasión la película, cuya piedra angular es la eterna batalla entre el bien y el mal, cuestiona esa dualidad aceptando que el mundo (la galaxia) no puede estar compuesto únicamente por tonos blancos y negros. Esta batalla por ser diferente está presente por toda la película: el villano de la cinta, supuestamente destinado a convertirse en el nuevo Darth Vader -Kylo Ren (Adam Driver)- duda estar a la altura de las expectativas; Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) acepta que los Jedi derivaron en una secta arrogante provista de fama pero al final fracasada, y la rebelión (cual izquierda mexicana) muestra su rostro más sectario cuando en plena crisis el Capitán Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) da golpe de estado para ejecutar el plan que él considera adecuado. Para rematar, un personaje secundario -Benicio del Toro como extraño heredero de la actitud de Han Solo- nos explica que ciertos contrabandistas de armas millonarios no sólo le venden al Imperio sino también a la Alianza Rebelde. El bien y el mal en la era Lucas era un tema de linaje, de blanco y negro, de luz y oscuridad, pero en este nuevo Star Wars es un tema de decisiones que deriva en un mar de grises. El espíritu parricida que estaba presente desde The Force Awakens continúa, brutalmente, en esta cinta. Pero como bien se ilustra en una de las escenas más enigmáticas de la película, no es sino un vil juego de espejos: Rey (Daisy Ridley) entra a una caverna donde su imagen se refleja al infinito; es la copia de la copia de la copia, y cuando intenta alcanzar lo que parece ser la última iteración de esa imagen, se encuentra con su mismo rostro de frente. Rian Johnson parece prever el destino de esta saga: por más que lo intenten, no estamos sino haciendo copias de lo mismo, una y otra vez. Y al final, por más cambios, por más parricidios, seguirá siendo Star Wars. Los primeros diez minutos de The Last Jedi son el resumen perfecto de lo que en esencia es La Guerra de las Galaxias: acción de primera línea, espectaculares efectos especiales, épicas batallas en el espacio, héroes de la clase trabajadora que enfrentan con arrojo y algo de arrogancia a un imperio militar que parece invencible, heroísmo a flor de piel, música de John Williams y mucho sentido del humor. Es imposible no emocionarse. Cual oscuros alquimistas, Disney pareciera haber encontrado la fórmula secreta que hace operar a Star Wars y no dudará en aplicarla de aquí al infinito. Son muchas las ambiciones de esta cinta. Claramente Disney necesita renovar la planilla de héroes, los originales ya están viejos, se les están muriendo. Urge posicionar a la nueva generación. El credo de Disney es el mismo de Kylo: “Let the past die. Kill it, if you have to”. Y es justo lo que están haciendo. La lista de servidumbres que Rian Johnson debe cumplir es extensa. El hombre debe ser la persona más presionada del planeta: tiene como jefes a Disney, como lejano censor a George Lucas y como incisivo juez a un planeta entero de fans que juzgarán su película y que, de ser exitosa, detonará todo un juego económico a base de juguetes, playeras y un sinfín de objetos de merchandising. Son miles de millones de dólares en juego. No hay espacio para el error. Como maquilador, Rian Johnson cumple y cumple bien. No importando la enorme cantidad de personajes, las varias subtramas, los muchos escenarios así como la gran cantidad de criaturas nuevas, el director logra que nosotros, el público, nos enganchemos rápido en la historia, nos emocionemos con los constantes giros de tuerca y no perdamos el interés en los más de 150 minutos que dura la cinta (la más extensa en la historia de Star Wars). Conforme la trama avanza el guión comienza a trastabillar. Es entonces cuando se hace evidente que, aunque el texto esté acreditado a Rian Johnson, el director no asume la tarea como un autor sino como un efectivo maquilador, hábil para manipular emociones, jugar con la nostalgia así como manosear nuestros mejores recuerdos de la saga, pero que a la postre no es lo profundo y trasgresor como pensábamos. Johnson sabe acatar órdenes. Con soluciones risibles, sacadas de la manga, Rian termina por cumplir con los ejecutivos pero no con la lógica básica de una cinta que carga una herencia de cuatro décadas. En su afán por vender el mismo producto a una generación ya no tan fácilmente impresionable, Johnson cumple en el terreno de la acción y la emotividad pero fracasa en hacer de esto algo inteligente. La Star Wars original no se trataba de cine de ciencia ficción ni tampoco de fantasía galáctica, era cine independiente con una clara veta autoral. Hoy, la independencia financiera y autoral han muerto. Johnson acata las órdenes con cierta gracia e indudable oficio, pero no con un guión que cuente una trama, se trata más de crear eventos y situaciones que parecen espectaculares pero que al final construyen una película hueca, desesperada por sorprender, cínica en la manipulación de nuestra nostalgia (“Esos son trucos baratos”, le dice Luke a R2D2 cuando lo intenta chantajear de la forma más vil) y cuya única meta es perpetuar el juego de espejos, poner el mantel para lo que viene. Bussines as usual."
"Feb 21, 2018",NEUTRAL," Los circuitos de cine acomodan sus carteleras para darle la mayor cantidad de salas al filme de moda en estos días, que lo es Star Wars: Los últimos Jedi (2017), dirigido por Rian Johnson. En buen lenguaje, debiera ser “Jedis”, en plural, pero no piensan así quienes titularon la película en español. También es filme que aprovecha una historia de cuarenta años, desde allá, cuando conocí los primeros pasos de esta larga y exitosa saga, entonces con título en español: La guerra de las galaxias. O sea, ahora que se habla del octavo episodio (sin contar Rogue One, del 2016), este filme lleva ya prerrogativas bien acomodadas a su favor. ¿Cómo logra una película –como esta– alcanzar tal popularidad? La receta está en cambiar, pero sin modificar lo esencial de la historia, como dijo alguien: “mutando sin mutar”; cada filme es como un cuento infantil contado de distintas maneras, lo que sucede casi siempre. La clave está en mantener esa constante lucha entre el bien y el mal, como si se tratase de aquellos distintos héroes clásicos que morían en su intento por vencer al minotauro en su laberinto de Creta, lo que logró Teseo gracias al ovillo de Ariadna. Lo que sucede con esta saga de evidente interés comercial es que siempre habrá algo más, y no es el ovillo de Ariadna. Así, los nuevos personajes aparecen en sucesión tal que siempre se justifica una trilogía nueva: aunque sea debajo de la piedra de la que Moisés sacó agua, de ahí saldrá un nuevo o una nueva Jedi. Lo que me gusta de Star Wars: Los últimos Jedi es su habilidad para mantener los conceptos de una larga historia, incluso con la presencia de personajes que creíamos abandonados fílmicamente, y hacerlo con tratamiento nuevo en el aspecto visual, sobre todo con un montaje alterno más rápido que dinamiza los tres ejes narrativos del filme. Ergo, igual sucede con las transiciones narrativas, con el necesario aumento de planos y con buen manejo de la elipsis (momentos narrativos que no vemos). Sin embargo, el filme se siente alargado sin serlo, creo que es porque maneja menos riqueza conceptual y se excede en batallas que cansan, por más bien logradas que estén visualmente. Las actuaciones no son tan convincentes (falla directoral). La música de John Williams abunda más de la cuenta, aunque tiene momentos muy oportunos para subrayar imágenes. La fotografía aporta poco ahogada por efectos especiales que no son tan novedosos. Para un espectador bisoño, no es tan fácil enlazar tantas referencias a otros filmes de la saga. En manos de Disney, a Star Wars: Los últimos Jedi no le faltan secuencias cursis o muñequitos simpáticos pasados de ternurismo: eso es Disney. Pese a ello, hay que reconocerle al director Rian Johnson el buen manejo de distintas emociones entre tanto movimiento bélico, lo que toca fibras de muchos espectadores. Hay buenas razones para recomendar Star Wars: Los últimos Jedi. Como efecto colateral, su ruido masivo oculta que en otras salas se dan filmes de Enyedi, Haneke, Kaurismaki, Mitre y Zvyagintsev, entre otros, en un Festival de Cine.

"Feb 20, 2018",POSITIVE,"The highs definitely outweigh the lows, and The Last Jedi is in the upper tier of films set in that far, far away galaxy."
"Feb 20, 2018",POSITIVE,The evolution of all the new characters was really good.
"Feb 9, 2018",POSITIVE," Rian Johnson, who was a director for television’s “Breaking Bad,” and who also helmed the wonderful “Brick,” directed “Star Wars: The Last Jedi.” Visually, it’s full of well-choreographed action, marvelous environments in air, land and water, a noteworthy color palette and, of course, engaging characters both long-beloved and new. All the new trilogy characters have spotlight moments while their characters develop. Chief among them is Rey (Daisy Ridley), who has been dispatched by Princess Leia (the late Carrie Fisher) to ask Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) for help. Also featured in pivotal roles are Finn (John Boyega), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver.) One of my favorites is Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), a member of the support crew that maintains the Resistance ships. Her background is quite compelling, and carries through to one of the final transition scenes. She and Finn make a nice team in a relationship that will be interesting to watch in upcoming sequels. The action begins immediately, with Poe among the pilots who are trying to take out an enemy First Order ship. The first laugh comes quickly when Poe has a mocking conversation with General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), a First Order leader. In the meantime, Rey confronts Luke and asks him for help. But Luke wants no part of being a Jedi. He wants to be left alone in his solitary existence on the island of Ahch-To, where he remains embittered by incidents from his past (you’ll find out details when you see the movie). The renowned motion-capture performer Andy Serkis plays Supreme Leader Snoke, the leader of the First Order. He recognizes that Kylo remains conflicted, and chides him: “You’re just a wild boy in a mask.” With every episode, film-making technology enhances the imagery a little more. There’s a wonderfully vivid battle scene toward the end, and there’s an eye-popping scene in a casino that’s a nod to the cantina fans know so well. Speaking of the cantina, this episode has a bevy of fascinating creatures that may appeal to those who welcome their high cuteness quotient. The porgs, for example, look like the offspring of an owl and a rabbit (I know that sounds weird, but you have to see them for yourself). Not surprisingly, they are available in various toy incarnations. Whether you seek action, spaceships, creatures, romance, war or drama, you’ll find it here in this franchise that remains a force to be reckoned with."
"Feb 1, 2018",POSITIVE,"Even if the stuffed-gills plot grew frustrating, I'm still looking forward to the next foray into a galaxy far, far away."
"Jan 24, 2018",POSITIVE," As a child of the 1970s, I grew up adoring the original Star Wars franchise … at least until The Return of the Jedi came around, with its silly Ewoks and wooden performances from lead actors who had somehow forgotten how to, well, act (or been misdirected). But the first two movies – with The Empire Strikes Back (#2, or #5 in Lucas’ revised chronology) as my favorite – remain strong in my memory, and have stood the test of many viewings over the years. As bad as the the prequels were (beginning with The Phantom Menace in 1999), they couldn’t take away the magical mythology of my youth. Two years ago, director J.J. Abrams revived the series with The Force Awakens, which cribbed liberally from the plot of the very first movie, but added likeable new characters – while bringing back the old – and forged a mostly successful new path into the story. Now we have The Last Jedi, from Rian Johnson (Looper), to take us forward into merry (and not so merry) new adventures. How does it fare? Read on, young-at-heart Padawan! First of all, be prepared that the movie takes its status as epic quite seriously. At 150 minutes, it is the longest of the franchise. For those who want as much Star Wars as they can get, with the long-awaited return of Luke Skywalker as a tour-de-force centerpiece, then I suspect more will be more, and then some. For people less inclined to uncritical fandom, however, it’s a problem, especially because the script that supports our reunion with the prodigal Jedi is a mess, filled with nonsensical plot twists and action sequences where narrative tides turn on the whim of the writer, without logical cohesion. None of this will matter at the box office, where the movie should make a killing; the big emotional beats, propped up on high like sacrifices on an altar, cry their clarion call of need to an audience primed for satisfaction. I was not immune, myself, to the joy of seeing an old friend, or of watching new friends develop further. I just wish the connective tissue were stronger. I wanted to like the film far more than I did. Thanks to the usual title crawl, we discover that the “First Order” – that successor to the Empire – continues its destructive space march through the galaxy, and is about to wipe out what remains of the rebellion, still led by former Princess – and now General – Leia Organa. In a rousing opening battle, hothead commander Poe Dameron ignores orders to retreat and leads his fellow X-Wing fighters in a raid of a “Dreadnought” ship that threatens to destroy the planet below. Though the rebels live to fight another day – or at least, to flee – the cost is high, leaving their forces crippled and barely out of reach of the First Order’s cannons. Meanwhile, Finn, that disaffected stormtrooper who joined forces with the rebellion last time, wakes up from the coma into which he plunged after fighting lead baddie Kylo Ren, and asks about Rey, the young woman he helped rescue from her desolate desert homeland of Jakku, and in whom the Force (that mystic galactic power controlled by the Jedi) runs strong. Cue Rey, on a planet far away, who now struggles to convince the newly discovered Luke Skywalker (the “last Jedi”) to train her in the use of that Force. Disillusioned by what happened when Kylo Ren, his former apprentice (and his nephew) turned to the “dark side,” he refuses, leaving Rey to seek out answers on her own; a vacuum needs filling, after all. It therefore suits her when a mysterious telepathic portal opens between her and Kylo, whom she bested in a light-saber battle at the end of the last movie (the same battle that left Finn in a coma). He offers her answers, though they may not be the ones she needs. We know he wants to recruit her to the First Order, but she thinks she can best him again, and remain in control. As we cut back and forth between her, the desperate rebels, and Finn and Rose (a new partner he meets upon awakening), who seek a way to stop the First Order’s fleet, we feel the ebb and pull of dramatic tension drawn taut and then released, in a combination at first thrilling, then dissipated as the plot drags on. We know there’s a climactic fight scene coming, and can only hope we remain awake long enough to watch it. Whatever I might think of the overblown, underdeveloped script, it is a joy to watch Mark Hamill as Skywalker. Gone are the nervous, self-conscious ticks of his early years; the gravitas of age makes his homecoming truly poignant. Most of the other leads are equally strong, including Daisy Ridley (Murder on the Orient Express), as Rey; John Boyega (Detroit), as Finn; and Oscar Isaac, as Poe (Ex Machina). Many new additions make their mark, as well, with Kelly Marie Tran, as Rose, the standout among them. Adam Driver (Paterson), who so annoyed me in The Force Awakens, delivers a much stronger performance here. His partner in evil, Domnhall Gleeson (Brooklyn), as General Hux, is less fine, though much of the problem stems not so much from the actor as from the tonally strange, abusively co-dependent relationship between the two men; their jokey rapport feels like it belongs in a very different movie. The late Carrie Fisher – to whom the film is dedicated in the closing credits – is perfectly watchable, though she is not given much to do. This is really Hamill’s movie. Good thing he is up to the task. Too bad that the story does not support his efforts. Very little makes sense, from the sacrifices people make, to the easy defeat of seemingly omnipotent villains. One thing that bothered me in The Force Awakens was Rey’s rapid control of the Force, without training. In The Empire Strikes Back, Luke spends most of the film learning how to use his power, only to abandon lessons too quickly and suffer the consequences of that decision. Here, Rey, though untutored, is somehow able to face off against foes with greater experience. I like her character and am happy to see her do well, but I do not appreciate the sloppy set-up. Beyond all that, if the film has one more glaring weakness, it’s in its CGI creatures, starting with the First Order’s Supreme Leader Snoke (animated, through motion-capture technology, by Andy Serkis, Golem in The Lord of the Rings trilogy), who moves in an odd, herky-jerky step that reminds us of his artificiality; every scene of his kicked me out of the narrative. In addition, there are many other digital creations, from cutesy Porgs to crystal wolves and more. Some are adorable, but the sum total of the mass of them feels more like a future plush-toy marketing gimmick than a solid story device. Again, I am sure that none of this will matter. There is just enough good material embedded in the excessive padding to appeal to our cravings for more Star Wars. It could have been worse (witness the prequels), but it could (and should) have been a lot better.

"Jan 22, 2018",POSITIVE,"When a character is in danger, you do feel that danger...there's something about the craftsmanship in this one. That feeling of security is gone, but the movie has a lot of humor too."
"Jan 22, 2018",POSITIVE," The Star Wars franchise is back from a galaxy far, far away, but is the Force with the new film? Read on for our Star Wars: The Last Jedi review!  Two years ago, Star Wars: Episode VII — The Force Awakens reignited the Star Wars movie franchise and blasted box-office records on its way to becoming the highest-grossing movie of all time (by a margin of nearly $200 million) in U.S. theaters. Although 2016’s prequel film, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, provided a bit of a buffer, make no mistake: This weekend’s Star Wars: Episode VIII — The Last Jedi has a lot to live up to when it picks up where The Force Awakens left off. Star Wars fans can rest easy, though, because director Rian Johnson’s installment of the beloved sci-fi saga doesn’t just satisfy expectations — it triumphantly exceeds them. Directed and written by Johnson, The Last Jedi brings back The Force Awakens stars Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac, and Domhnall Gleeson, as well as franchise veterans Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, and Anthony Daniels to continue the story of the brave rebels battling the sinister forces of the First Order, the brutal military organization that rose from the ashes of the Galactic Empire. The film introduces new characters played by Kelly Marie Tran, Laura Dern, and Benicio del Toro, and picks up shortly after the events of The Force Awakens. The Last Jedi clocks in at a hefty 152-minute running time, making it the longest installment of the series so far, but the film does an impressive job of mixing new and familiar elements in a way that makes it feel more compact and efficient than its runtime suggests. Where The Force Awakens occasionally felt bogged down in reverence for the original trilogy — particularly 1977’s franchise-spawning first installment — The Last Jedi seems more inclined to spread its narrative wings and explore the universe that the eight prior films established. Of the returning characters, Ridley’s mysterious, Force-sensitive scavenger, Rey, and Driver’s angsty aspiring Sith, Kylo Ren, are the most extensively developed in The Last Jedi, with Rey’s story arc serving up a particularly satisfying bridge between the past and the future of the Star Wars franchise. Although the film does an impressive job of spreading screen time around among its large cast, it’s her story that does most of the heavy lifting when it comes to expanding the saga narratively and validating what is — and more frequently, what isn’t — important about the series canon. That last aspect of the film is an important one, as Johnson’s willingness to acknowledge then overtly dismiss or minimize certain elements or moments that Star Wars fans have been trained to revere is not just a bold move, but a refreshing one — due in no small way to how expertly it’s handled. The Star Wars franchise isn’t exactly known for its comedy, but Johnson’s script peppers the story with funny moments that play to his cast’s strengths. The dry humor of series veterans Hamill and Fisher provides some of the film’s funniest moments, and Johnson’s script seems unafraid to poke fun at what the audience expects from the film, only to turn around and offer something more rewarding to fans in return. That self-awareness and a willingness not to take itself too seriously (Star Wars is essentially one big space opera, after all) is a big part of what makes The Last Jedi feel unique in the franchise. The “space magic” wielded by the heroes and villains of the franchise is treated as exactly that in The Last Jedi — with no further explanation necessary — and although the story generally remains compelling enough to earn the suspension of disbelief it begs, the film has moments that might verge too far into the campy for some audiences. Driver’s brooding, Force-wielding First Order soldier Kylo Ren is the recipient of more character development in the film, but he still feels entirely unthreatening throughout most of The Last Jedi. His emo version of Darth Vader quickly wears out its welcome in the film, so it’s fortunate that The Last Jedi spends more time on its hero characters than on Kylo and the First Order. Driver’s character is clearly intended to show fans what Anakin or Luke Skywalker might have been like without the tempering influence of their Jedi mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi, but along with being more destructive and petulant than either Jedi, Kylo is also exponentially more annoying. Johnson seems well aware of this aspect of Driver’s character, though, and his willingness to poke fun at Kylo’s persistent moodiness in The Last Jedi makes the character infinitely more tolerable. In what is expected to be her final film in the franchise (due to her death in December 2016), Fisher is captivating and compelling as General Leia Organa, and the role she plays in the events that transpire is fitting for her station both in the Star Wars universe and as one of its greatest icons. The caliber of her performance is matched by that of fellow franchise star Hamill, whose Luke Skywalker might be older and wiser in The Last Jedi, but is still haunted by the character flaws that made him so endearing (and again, occasionally annoying) in the original trilogy. No mere cameo players in this newly revived Star Wars series, Fisher and Hamill — like Harrison Ford before them — have important parts to play in The Last Jedi and perform with a conviction that ultimately honors the franchise. Ford, while no longer a part of the current Star Wars universe, will play no small part in the 2018 offshoot, Solo: A Star Wars Story. More so than The Force Awakens before it, The Last Jedi offers the most exciting, wonder-inspiring view of the franchise’s future so far (although who knows what Episode IX will bring). Johnson’s film is a great reminder of the saga’s potential for thrilling stories, powerful emotional moments, and a genuine sense of fun, and it provides that reminder without getting wrapped up in nostalgic navel-gazing. The next chapter of the Star Wars: Rebels saga has come with the premiere of the Disney+ series, Ahsoka. Set years after the disappearance of Ezra Bridger and Grand Admiral Thrawn, the show follows Ahsoka Tano when she seeks them both out as she tries to prevent another war with the remnants of the Galactic Empire. If there's one thing that Star Wars does better than any other space opera, it's action. Since the debut of the original Star Wars film in 1977, the franchise has continuously upped its action game and put other franchises to shame. This week, the legacy continues with Ahsoka, a new Star Wars spinoff series heading to Disney+. If the trailers are any indication, fans are in for more lightsaber action and intrigue. Although it's gotten better in recent years, the world of Star Wars has been traditionally dominated by men. Men have, for the most part, been the main characters of these stories, and, stereotypically at least, been the biggest fans of the franchise. All along, though, Star Wars has had compelling female characters that were well worth rooting for or vilifying.

"Jan 19, 2018",NEGATIVE,"The new, machine-tooled The Last Jedi is sufficiently busy (action scenes occurring every ten minutes) to make you grateful that it is, at least, agreeably paced, even if it isn't really about anything."
"Jan 18, 2018",POSITIVE,"I both loved it and strongly disliked it at the same time. I feel like there's a really great movie in there, all the pieces are there, everything is brilliant, but then there's a lot of extra fat that needed to be trimmed off or rearranged."
"Jan 10, 2018",POSITIVE,"At two-and-a-half hours, with about nine separate cliffhanger endings, it's a bit long, but Johnson's keen visual sense, doses of humor and a couple of cameos buoy the film"
"Jan 9, 2018",POSITIVE," ""Overrated"" is a bit of a loaded word, especially when used on an individual basis; you can't fairly tell somebody they didn't actually like something as much as they did, for example. But you can call out what seems to be groupthink when you see it -- for example, the default assumption that you must think Pixar animated features are the greatest thing ever, every time, so long as they make you cry even a little bit and aren't called ""Cars."" Pixar makes films of high technical quality, for sure, but they aren't any more above criticism than Michael Bay. There are many different ways a film can be overrated, and the inclusion of a film on this list doesn't necessarily mean it's overall a bad film. It mainly means, from my perspective, that if you think it's an example of cinematic greatness, you really need to see more movies. Warning: if you still have not seen these movies, there will be spoilers. With a 13% Tomatometer rating and a domestic gross of $33 million on a budget of $120mm, how can I possibly say it's overrated? Two ways. First, it actually made its budget back and then some internationally, for a total global gross of $208 million. Secondly, there exists a fervent segment of fandom that from the first trailer onward, was determined to make this their next Sharknado or Snakes on a Plane. But it isn't gloriously good-bad; it's just another mediocre Dean Devlin script that can neither make its premise believable nor lean in to the absurdity the way Transformers movies do. There's a lot to like in the new Star Wars film, from Mark Hamill doing career-best work as PTSD Luke to Adam Driver genuinely making Kylo Ren a sympathetic villain who's arguably the true protagonist of the new saga. But it is not, as so many are saying, either the best Star Wars movie ever nor even the best since The Empire Strikes Back. It pointedly tosses out any mysteries from The Force Awakens that were too inconvenient, undercooks a subplot about war profiteering that never really affects the main characters, and for the first time in the central ""saga"" films, changes up the cinematic language to make directorial voice much more apparent and conspicuous (a choice many people are happy with, it turns out). And then there's that final scene of kids playing with homemade Star Wars figures and gaining inspiration from a secret decoder ring that is no doubt shipping in bulk to souvenir stands right now. Yes, Star Wars has always had toy tie-ins, but having the characters in the movie play with them is one self-referential step too far. It's a marvel to look at, and it wants to think its dark, downbeat tone is adventurous. But have you noticed that every time Caesar is forced into a serious moral dilemma that would compromise his innate goodness, he loses his agency when external factors or another character makes the choice for him? Also, that it's basically just The Ten Commandments with chimps? The difference is that the Charlton Heston-starring Ten Commandments was also meant to be about modern good and evil struggles, with Cecil B. DeMille hoping that audiences who booed the evil Egyptians would see parallels to Soviet communism. War for the Planet of the Apes doesn't take its biblical allegory any further, and it's poorer for it. I'll back an Oscar campaign for either Andy Serkis or Steve Zahn, though. Hey, did you know some cowboys and Cavalrymen were racist, and Indians weren't the bad guys portrayed in old Hollywood westerns? If so, you're way ahead of this movie, which wastes Christian Bale and Wes Studi in an overlong exercise in virtue-signaling. By the time it remembers there was supposed to be a love story thrown in there too, it's too late to make you care about the final scene. Meryl Streep is wonderful (almost a redundant phrase these days) as Washington Post publisher Kay Graham, who's more used to lavish upstate dinner parties than the business of newspapering. But Tom Hanks feels false as editor Ben Bradlee; I've worked in actual newsrooms, and he feels more like a coworker doing a comedic impersonation of an editor-in-chief than a real one. Also, movies: I don't need you to hold my hand through the Trump administration while telling me it's going to be okay. As with Star Wars: The Last Jedi, I'm content to end on a note of underdogs sounding a call to defiance; I neither want nor require a subsequent scene about how things eventually worked out well because other people did different good things later. A Tonya Harding biopic with Margot Robbie ought to have been a slam dunk, or whatever the appropriate analogous skating metaphor is. It should have been her chance to redo Wolf of Wall Street with herself in the lead. Unfortunately, the film never finds its tone, dithering between ironically sympathizing with Tonya and condescending to her. A stronger commitment in either direction would have made it truly memorable. The best thing about Pixar's Coco -- and rest assured, I do think it's a very good thing -- is that it will stealthily deliver an education about Mexican culture into the houses of kids whose parents might not care to point them in that direction, just as Sesame Street normalized the notion of bilingualism for me as a child. That doesn't change the fact that the movie's actual story depicts a toxic relationship without seeming to know it, with a grandmother who has let her family live an angry, joyless lie despite the fact that it made her own life worse, and that she kept the proof of the real story all along. Scenes of senile dementia will always jerk tears from me, as my father has it. But I left Coco angry that its entire plot needn't have happened if the family had ever once acted reasonably or communicated properly. I enjoyed its colorful afterlife, though, and would be happy enough to experience it in theme-park ride form. So long as the story stays in South Korea, Okja is a beautiful and clever tale of a girl and her oversized mutant pig. But once the story moves to America, and Jake Gyllenhaal somehow becomes Jar Jar Binks the Second, its on-the-nose jabs at big business and factory farming feel hysterical rather than earned. Is the famous Grease song ""Summer Lovin'"" insufficient in length? You want a version of it that's over two hours long? Apparently a whole lot of critics did, and perhaps identified it with events in their own lives. But if you can't do that, it's like sitting through your oversharing neighbor's two-hour vacation slideshow. In lieu of such a hypothetical neighbor, Michael Stuhlbarg summarizes the entire point of the movie at the end (first love, first heartbreak, and hey, maybe dad thought about being bisexual once too!), and then Timothee Chalamet stares sadly into the camera for the full duration of the end credits. This is brilliance? Even the much-ballyhooed beautiful Italian scenery isn't particularly well-photographed until that last snowbound exterior. I'm happy to see people appreciate Armie Hammer, and if this what it takes for him to circle back around and become the next Batman, well and good. But I'm mystified that people see much else worthwhile in this excruciatingly boring travelogue."
"Jan 5, 2018",POSITIVE,"The music still feels fresh and Rian Johnson's film will please the fans with its wonderful visuals and abundance of action. But for me, there was something missing."
"Jan 5, 2018",POSITIVE,"The story is compelling and there are some good characters to follow on this journey through many twists and turns. The acting is solid, and the visual effects are top notch. This is an impressive effort by writer-director Rian Johnson ('Looper')."
"Jan 3, 2018",NEGATIVE,"The mission is noble. The result, disastrous. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Jan 2, 2018",POSITIVE," The answer seems obvious, but it's not. This year, many critics and film polls named David Lynch's ""Twin Peaks: The Return"" the best movie of 2017, despite the fact that it was a serial released as 18 episodes on the Showtime cable network. Meanwhile, several of the year's more rewarding films, including ""Mudbound"" and ""Okja,"" skipped theaters (in most cities) and appeared directly on Netflix or other streaming platforms. Even so, I'm sticking to tradition. As usual, my annual Top Ten list (and its complement, the Second Ten) is culled entirely from the ranks of feature films that had their local debuts in public venues in Memphis in 2017. In other words, these are films that Memphians had the chance to see in a theater, museum or other public gathering place. (This also means that such major awards contenders as ""Call Me by Your Name"" and Steven Spielberg's ""The Post"" are not eligible, since they won't reach Memphis until 2018.) Even with these restrictions, I was not lacking for titles for consideration. According to my records, 869 ""feature films"" (including filmed-live-onstage operas and other cinema events) screened publicly in Memphis in 2017. That, my friends, is a record, at least in the 20-plus years I've been keeping tabs on the matter. 1. ""Get Out"": Aroused by the specious argument that the election of Obama had inaugurated a ""post-racial"" America and prophetic in its imagining of an ascendant white supremacist conspiracy, writer-director Jordan Peele's sardonic horror movie struck a nerve: The film grossed more than $110 million on a budget of $4.5 million, a sign that a large sector of 2017 America desperately needed its distillation of satire, cri de guerre and catharsis. Accurately if reductively summarized as ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" meets ""The Stepford Wives,"" the movie generates suspense, laughs, discomfort and revelation in equal doses as a young black photographer (Daniel Kaluuya) joins his white girlfriend (Allison Williams) for a weekend at the estate of her well-to-do parents (Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford), self-proclaimed Obama-voters and educated apparent liberals whose eccentric black ""servants"" (Marcus Henderson and the awe-inspiring Betty Gabriel) and even odder friends prove anything but color-blind. With urgency and sorrow, sketch comedy artist turned debuting feature filmmaker Peele evokes seemingly the entire history of American racism within his genre template, from slavery (white control of black bodies) to Trayvon Martin (extralegal punishment for the ""crime"" of being black); when the film ends, the hero is saved while the viewer is returned to ""the sunken place"" of the Trumpocracy. 2. ""A Quiet Passion"": Harrowing and humorous, meticulous British director Terence Davies' eighth feature in 30 years is a biographical portrait that follows Emily Dickinson — arguably the most important poet produced by America to date — from her precocious girlhood to her hard death at 55 in 1886 Amherst, Massachusetts. The mannered, almost Wilde-level banter shared by Emily (Cynthia Nixon) and her sophisticated friends and relatives and the voice-over readings of some of Emily’s posthumously published poems provide tragic contrasts with the convulsions of Emily’s illness, which reduce communication to strangled gasps; Davies’ camera, meanwhile, makes a virtue of wordless eloquence. 3. ""The Florida Project"": Heir to the traditions of Huck Finn, Disney's Pinocchio, the ""Our Gang"" shorts (a debt acknowledged in the end credits) and other tales of near feral children, writer-director Sean Baker's beautiful followup to ""Tangerine"" (which similarly focused on scrappy marginalized hustlers) transforms the garish strip malls and pastel short-term motels of Disneyfied Orlando into a magical playground of discovery and peril for a foul-mouthed 6-year-old charmer (Brooklynn Prince) and her friends. Bringing his four decades of actorly wiles to the role of a sympathetic hotel manager, Willem Dafoe adds ballast (and the reassurance that this is fiction, despite all the non-actors and genuine locations) to the picaresque plot, which otherwise might prove too heartbreaking to bear. 4. ""Lady Bird"": Inspired by her Sacramento roots and all-girl Catholic school upbringing, actress Greta Gerwig makes her debut as a solo writer-director with an early 2000s-set coming-of-age story that places its expected classmate rivalries and sexual fumblings within an acutely rendered social and economic context; eccentric, self-absorbed, self-reinventing high school senior Lady Bird (Saoirse Ronan) yearns to escape to the expensive East Coast even as her parents (Laurie Metcalf and Tracy Letts, both wonderful) struggle to pay the bills. Shunning glumness and embracing uplift, the film proves as appealing as its heroine. ""I guess I pay attention,"" says Lady Bird, explaining the loving detail found in one of her essays; from the evidence here, Gerwig does, too. 5. ""Baby Driver"": Motorvating to the sounds of Stax, T. Rex and Queen, writer-director Edgar Wright's pedal-to-the-metal plus needle-to-the-vinyl action movie about a young getaway-car driver (Ansel Elgort) is a love letter to the never obsolete wonders of fast cars, pop music and crafty commercial/personal filmmaking.  6. ""A Ghost Story"": Writer-director Davis Lowery (who did some of his early ""mumblecore"" film work in Memphis) employs a symbol so simple a child recognizes it to probe issues of life, death, time and rebirth: As in a Halloween cartoon, Lowery's silent ghost is represented by a person (Casey Affleck, entirely hidden for most of the movie) draped in a bedsheet, with two dark holes for eyes. Haunting (yes), and powerful, with a recognition of the transience of existence (planetary as well as human) that recalls the work of Terrence Malick. 7. ""Wonder Woman"": As the DC Comics Amazon princess originally introduced in 1941, Israeli actress Gal Gadot is a made-for-the-camera charmer and the ideal embodiment of female empowerment in an ugly male-dominated (cinema and otherwise) world; she's not just courageous but compassionate, and her message is one that likely never would occur to her Justice League colleagues: ""Only love can truly save the world."" Laced with screwball romantic comedy (Chris Pine is the potential love interest), the early fish-out-of-water episodes involving Princess Diana's introduction to ""civilization"" more than make up for the tiresome digital-effects action finale; the result is a movie that — like the rousing electric-guitar-laced theme music by Rupert Gregson-Williams — thrills and even swells the heart, while impudently suggesting that ""when it comes to pleasure,"" as Diana notes, men are ""unnecessary."" 8. ""Toni Erdmann"": Belatedly arriving in Memphis two weeks after its nomination for the Best Foreign Language Film of 2016 (it lost), German director Maren Ade's shaggy 162-minute father-daughter comedy-drama rides joke-shop teeth, fright wigs, a naked party and an uncomfortable yet somehow moving cover of ""The Greatest Love of All"" to arrive at a wholly original place. The loose fly-on-the-wall filmmaking style gives stars Peter Simonischek and Sandra Hüller plenty of room to feint and parry until a climactic confrontation in which the daughter is entirely exposed while the father is entirely concealed, a situation that encapsulates the tension between artifice and honesty that is Ade's theme. 9. ""The Shape of Water"": Inspired by the injustices and prejudices of traditional beauty-and-the-beast monster movies, writer-director Guillermo del Toro's reimagines ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" as a romance, with marvelous Sally Hawkins as the mute cleaning woman who risks the raptures of the deep when she befriends a captive ""amphibian man"" in a top-secret government research facility in the Cold War 1960s. A feast of art direction, old-movie homages and generous characterization that teeters like a wedding cake under the weight of its confectionary richness, the movie is the most elaborate explication to date of del Toro's belief that monsters, like traditional religious martyrs, are ""innocents"" whose torments testify to their ""state of grace."" 10. ""Dunkirk"": Christopher Nolan's monumental, multiple-perspective recreation of the Allied evacuation of the French coast in 1940 is a tribute to wartime resolve and directorial hubris; it's awe-inspiring in its logistics, scale and achievement. 1. ""Colossal"": Substance-abusing New Yorker Anne Hathaway returns to her small Midwest hometown and discovers, absurdly, that her presence there is directly linked to the depredations of a Seoul-stomping giant monster. Entirely original, writer-director Nacho Vigalondo's movie scores points about the catastrophes unwitting Americans enable overseas (through their voting choices, among other things), and also says something about sexual harassment and male privilege; this might not matter much if the filmmaker also hadn't delivered a fine working-class comedy-drama, with a career best supporting performance from Jason Sudeikis.  2. ""It"": Andy Muschietti directs a Stephen King-inspired throwback to 1980s horror, unpretentious and scary, with a crack ensemble of kids led by future Amy Adams, Sophia Lillis. 3. ""Lady Macbeth"": Owing more to Brontë and Highsmith than to Shakespeare (in fact, the source is an 1865 novella by Russia's Nikolai Leskov), this rigorously grim moor noir presents its catalog of 19th century parricide, mariticide, infanticide and equine-cide as the consequences of a class and caste system that dehumanizes even those who materially benefit from its design. Directed by William Oldroyd and scripted by Alice Birch, the film makes an intriguing complement to ""Get Out,"" as a rural manor's innocent black servant (Naomi Ackie) pays a high unjust price for the connivances of her young white mistress (Florence Pugh). 4. ""Logan"": Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is a limo driver and Professor X (Patrick Stewart) is suffering from dementia in director James Mangold's elegiac alternative-future ""X-Men"" sidebar, which owes more to ""Fat City"" and ""The Shootist"" than to the cross-promotional demands of any Marvel movie universe. 5. ""Marvin Booker Was Murdered"": Screened in February at Clayborn Temple and in November during the Indie Memphis Film Festival, Wade Gardner's no-budget documentary about a former Memphis street preacher killed by jail guards in Denver was the least polished, the bluntest and most naive of the year's many racial injustice documentaries (other worthy entries included ""The Work,"" ""Whose Streets?"" and ""The Blood Is at the Doorstep""), but its simplicity proved devastating: The screening I attended left audience members in tears. 6. ""mother!"": Reviled by most and celebrated by some, Darren Aronofsky's latest irritation includes the removal of a rib to signal the arrival of a woman (Ed Harris suffers the wound, Michelle Pfeiffer emerges and suffers no fools); a Cain-and-Abel-esque fratricide; and a flood (from a broken sink). But if it's silly as biblical allegory it's potent as a comedic parable about the selfishness and egoism of the process of (male) artistic creation, as struggling poet Javier Bardem ignores wife Jennifer Lawrence in favor of his muse and his fawning fans.  7. ""My Life as a Zucchini"": A Swiss-French production adapted from a book by Gilles Paris, Claude Barras' compact stop-motion animated feature about a young boy coping with his new life in an orphanage never panders or becomes cloying on its way to a well-earned ""we are family"" conclusion. 8. ""Personal Shopper"": One of the more interesting performers in movies today, Kristin Stewart reunites with French writer-director Olivier Assayas for a modern-dress semi-ghost story that is more effective in its depiction of alienation than in its evocation of the uncanny. (The sparse but unambiguous use of digital effects lessens the impact of the supernatural episodes.) 9. ""Silence"": Martin Scorsese's passion project about 17th-century Jesuit priests (Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver) risking their lives to promote Christianity in feudal Japan applies an ascetic aesthetic to its depiction of imprisonment, drowning and torture. 10. ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"": Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher bring heightened emotion to their signature roles, but more important is director Rian Johnson's increased commitment to the matter-of-fact diversity of ""a galaxy far, far away"" and to the high style of the swashbuckling set pieces: a red throne room evokes the Technicolor fantasies of Michael Powell and Vincente Minnelli, while the scratchy surfaces of a sand planet turn the arc of each combatant's footwork into a choreographer's notation, transforming a duel into a dance."
"Jan 2, 2018",POSITIVE," 
This is a good and thoughtful review. However, you would be well-served to rewatch the last 20 minutes of this film. I promise you, there is joy to be found, even if it is bittersweet.
 
This seems like a contrarian review after everybody else had posted theirs. It's the middle of a trilogy -- I don't recall a lot of joy in Empire or, well, any of the Lucas prequels. But, yeah, tough to have enthusiasm or wonder in the context of the film (war and annihilation, the seeming triumph of evil). ""Most people struggle with far less in a lifetime than these people do in just over two hours"" -- er, yeah, it's a war movie. I just don't understand what you want this to be, exactly.
 
I agree wholeheartedly with this reviewer/critic. I was completely underwhelmed with this installment of the much-loved Star Wars franchise. I was so hoping this film would blow me away; it blew me away all right -- but for all the wrong reasons! Like Weimer Carvalho commented above, this movie is something to be forgotten.
"
"Jan 1, 2018",NEGATIVE," ...although I've got a bad feeling about this, I'm not here to hate, nor to hate the haters, nor to hate the haters who hate the haters, etc. We've seen a lot of that, re: Di$ney $tar War$, in the past few days -- the animosity reflecting our current social climate. In The Last Jedi, quoth scrappy new character Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran): “That's how we're gonna win: not fighting what we hate -- saving what we love.” Bingo, Rose! -- even though your subplot mercilessly meanders. Thank you for liberating those Space Llamas on the Monte Carlo planet; oh, and for denouncing Space Capitalism in a Disney movie. I like irony. As a 40-year veteran of the Star Wars phenomenon -- and also as a person who can happily live without it (I was the child who, upon the original's release, noted: “There are spaceship movies on TV every Saturday; why should we pay to see this one?”) -- I may bring to this pop-cultural rift some useful perspective, if perhaps not, uh, Balance to the Force. Ha. Note: For this latest Star Wars money-spinner, but also for life itself, this review contains spoilers (gasp!), sarcasm, sweet'n'sour sauce, and other elements any grownup should be able to handle. It also celebrates the 20th anniversary of Mark Hamill in Laserhawk, plus the 40th anniversary of Mr. Hamill in some other sci-fi movie. Performance-wise, he's fab in both of these movies: portraying a mystical outsider who may be nuts. As for this new-old Luke Skywalker being woefully misconceived, he claims that the 180 on his opinion has nothing to do with the Mouse slapping his mouth shut, so despite his own dissing of the depiction, we'll take him at his word. Disney's third attempt at a Star Wars movie is handicapped by a storytelling attempt best defined by a popular term which begins with “cluster.” Launched in Episode VII under the dubious helm of J.J. Abrams -- whose skill set as revealed by the Star Trek reboots entails gleefully destroying and scribbling over other people's beloved IP and iconography -- we got a lazy retread of Episode IV, featuring cost-effective millennial actors packaged in irritating “mystery boxes,” plus a bewilderingly mean attitude toward cherished old characters -- whose conclusive victory in Episode VI is hereby trashed. Gosh, striding out of Return of the Jedi in 1983, I just couldn't wait to wait for over three decades to watch Han, Leia, and Luke grow apart, fail miserably, and die. Thanks! Episode VIII -- unless we're all being punked and there's a real Episode VIII shelved somewhere -- pulls off the noteworthy stunt of disappointing both the OT fans and the Disney fans (if any). Han already died incredibly stupidly (via a son whose name should be Jacen Solo; not Ben, who is Luke's son -- flushing the terrific Expanded Universe was lazy and rude). That elderly smuggler unceremoniously killed off, this time we get dire old deserter Luke -- what a treat! Plus, even with a full year to come up with a respectful death scene to suit real life, Leia appears more beleaguered than ever -- yet is left alive at film's end to continue suffering?! Series mainstays R2-D2 and C-3PO appear as obligatory afterthoughts. Meanwhile, re: the prefab intrigues established in The Force Awakens (The Force was asleep?) -- e.g. Rey's parentage on Tatooine-2, the Knights of Ren Faire, stupid Snoke, yadda-yadda -- rather than giving us any satisfying narrative payoffs, this trainwreck gives everyone the finger. I really don't envy Abrams having to clean up this mess in Episode IX. Not that he will. While the Resistance-Republic-Rebellion continue battling the Old Empire’s First Order (Slight Return), central-casting “badass” Mary Sue (Daisy Ridley) bugs grouchy, retired Mope Sleepwalker (Hamill) to teach her T'ai Chi at a real-world monastery disrespectfully turned into a goofy movie joke because money. Meanwhile, the League of Strong Women (Carrie Fisher, Laura Dern in Battle Gown™, etc.), struggle to outrun Battlestar Galactica's Imperious Leader (Andy Serkis), the “Diet Emperor” who lives then promptly dies on a big red soundstage. Mary Sue descends into the Instagram Pit of Infinite Millennial Narcissism, steals the “religious” texts Ghost Yoda (Frank Oz) tries to destroy with lightning (?!), and goes off to confront petulant, topless Rilo Kiley (Adam Driver) -- except the misconceived former Jedi everyone waited 34 years to see beats her to the tedious Hoth/Minas Tirith simulation, mocks Rilo, then drops dead of astral projection. The End. Along the way -- in a movie so utterly unoriginal it feels like James Cameron made it -- we get some new Chewbacca guy beset by wacky Minions (“porgs”), a four-boobed, lactating Space Walrus, Leia copycatting River Song's suitless space flight, Captain Phantasm's left eye for a few seconds, the Enterprise E-vs.-Scimitar tactical crash from Star Trek: Nemesis, the good-evil psychic link straight outta Halloween 5, a laser version of Grond (look it up), plus writer-director Rian Johnson inexcusably killing off fan fave Admiral Ackbar. A long time ago on a playground far, far away, did some little Ackbar fan tease little Johnson? This movie feels like repercussions thereof. Plus so many questions: How can bombers use gravity in outer space? Why can't an omnipotent girl tell when her hand is being tickled with a weed? Why does an animal's stall have an alarm button at the back near its rear feet? Why use walkers on a planet with a flat surface and no snow? And the real stumper: You added a casino planet, and you didn't bring back Lando?! Does anything in Episode VIII work? Hey, sure. Consider that, unlike my perpetually-enraged peers, I truly like George Lucas' Prequels. Just gimme a good ride. In fairness, The Last Jedi can be said to deliver 150 minutes of hyperactive fanfic festooned with Star Wars-y visuals. If you ignore its cringeworthy script -- and exec-producer Abrams' annoying Beastie Boys references -- it's fun to look at. Diverse casting is always welcome, and herein doesn't stumble into Benetton-lineup triteness. And John Williams yet again unleashes his seductively familiar themes (via some discount orchestra) to rally the increasingly confused fans. You know the drill. To me The Last Jedi doesn't feel like anyone at Disney is bringing their A-game yet, but, as with any spaceship movie on a Saturday afternoon, it beats watching sports. Laserhawk, on the very distant other hand, is a movie -- not a corporate onslaught. Writer John A. Curtis and director Jean Pellerin deliver the cogent, entertaining, no-b.s. tale of a charming mental patient (Mark Hamill) who believes he's an ancient alien, and thus is sought by two John Hughes-esque youths (Mélissa Galianos, Jason James Richter), who are convinced that their nerd life in Wisconsin, Canada is about to be permanently disrupted by, um, “Arachtoids”: quoth Richter's character: “spiders...from Mars” who “germinated” the earth, with us, and are returning to feed. If this sounds a bit heavy (there's also a bullying dad, and a rude fat cop), consider that the story revolves around a comic book series -- based on the ravings of Bob Sheridan (Hamill as #LoonybinLuke) -- which foretells the details of the invasion. It's the fun sort of plot device, perfect for a Saturday afternoon, that today's swaggering tentpole events usually neglect, and it harks back to the love of pulpy storytelling celebrated in Mr. Hamill's own Comic Book: The Movie. (Note: Hair!) Am I going to find parallels between Laserhawk and The Last Jedi? You bet. In both movies, Mr. Hamill portrays the wise elder, stuck in an awkward position and appearing insane, who might help the young protagonists overcome ghastly adversaries (though in Laserhawk, he actually shows up). In Laserhawk, echoing Star Wars, he shouts: “Looks like we got company!” There are space battles (’90s effects technology — Video Toaster? — notwithstanding). Oh, and the girl in Laserhawk is a progressive environmentalist and outspoken vegetarian; apparently Daisy Ridley is a vegan (A New Hope, indeed). I could go on. I just might. How do these two Hamill performances measure up? Honestly, although Mark did a bang-up job monkeying through what The Last Jedi demanded of him, I feel that those demands were unfair. Not to speak for the man, but it seems he'd gladly show up for 20 more turns as Luke -- and his millions of fans would be thrilled to have him. Bringing him back to kill him off doesn't even make business sense. And Luke isn't Obi-Wan (who patiently guarded child-Luke from nearby), and he isn't Yoda (who felt it best to hide until needed); the depressing version of Luke in The Last Jedi is presented as a would-be child-killer who has abandoned his desperate peers to go slurp ugly monsters, read nothing, learn nothing, then die alone. Garbage. I hope great things come to veteran actor and artist Mr. Hamill, for turning that slop into a strong, even moving performance -- however, his supporting role in Laserhawk, not leveraged against fans to be arrogantly “subversive,” is simpler, clearer, and fleetingly, more fun. Which is saying something, considering that he's a 250-million-year-old alien whose life story has been stolen to make a hack rich. Currently you can watch Laserhawk on YouTube for free -- but I recommend purchasing it from a local thrift store for a buck, as I did. Support your local businesses! And indeed, just as the original Star Wars was hatched by a nerd with a love of nerdery -- allegedly, nobody knew it would be a hit -- remember that there are loads of terrific storytellers, who love their fans instead of punishing them, who simply weren't invited to the right board meetings.

"Dec 31, 2017",POSITIVE," The Force lives on with new blood. The same special effects and light saber hokum stalls for time in what appears to be a rebuilding year for the franchise. Notice is given at the outset when a 100-decibel opening dose of John Williams knocks you back in your seat like a laser siege cannon. If you came to this movie by mistake, you soon know it. A cast of new characters is led by Daisy Ridley playing Rey. Rey appears to be the Jedi-elect as the franchise prepares to phase out Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Her nemesis is Adam Driver, playing Kylo Ren, the conflicted baddy who is torn between doing the right thing and becoming master of the universe. The screenplay does not do justice to either one of the characters, retreading them as the new Luke and Darth Vader.  Rather than making us love them, it implores us to go along. Even Chewbacca seems poised for replacement by a band of alien ground squirrels.  Laura Dern, of all people, pops up as Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, serving under Leia (footage of the deceased Carrie Fisher taken before her death). If Dern is slated to take over from Carrie Fisher as admiral she may soon wish she was back pounding the Pacific Crest Trail with Reese Witherspoon. One can hardly imagine how the Dern decision was made. With all respect to her, it comes off as one more step towards turning the beloved Jedi saga into another tired Star Trek franchise. Domhnall Gleeson adds a much-needed touch of humor as the feckless General Hux. Made up as a composite of Jared Kushner and Donald Trump Jr., he repeatedly pulls defeat out of certain victory as the masters of the dark forces slap him around like Moe twisting Curly’s nose in “The Three Stooges.” Andy Serkis does a good job as Supreme Leader Snoke, but, then, we never see him act except through a computer augmented face job. His role as Caesar in the “Planet of the Apes” franchise demanded more. As the supreme leader he does not so much act as he snarls while delivering insults. Oscar Isaac struggles to anchor the jingoistic maverick fighter role as pilot Poe Dameron. He is infinitely more at home in the streets, as Llewyn Davis or in “A Most Violent Year.” Even so, he takes up the slack since Luke Skywalker is out of the pilot seat. Kelly Marie Tran steals the show with her work as a surprising savvy security guard who also has a talent for the stick and rudder. John Boyega, as Finn, her partner in these antics, comes up short.  Benicio Del Toro adds a twist to the cast as code-breaking DJ, the genius without loyalty. He can fill the nefarious, pirate-of-all-trades segment of the Han Solo void while Oscar Isaac fills the maverick pilot part. One hopes that neither Del Toro or Laura Dern gets permanently sucked into the Disney void, doomed to spend eternity as a cartoon."
"Dec 30, 2017",POSITIVE," The saga begins with this relentlessly erratic installment detailing the rise of the long-dormant Sith, with the narrative following Jedi knights Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) as they attempt to forestall a growing rift between the Republic and the Empire. (The pair also encounter and work with a young boy named Anakin Skywalker.) Though far from the disaster one might have expected, Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace is rarely able to wholeheartedly able to capture one's full interest - as writer/director George Lucas has suffused the rather impenetrable narrative with a host of ill-conceived, underwhelming elements. Ranking near the top of that list is, of course, the character of Jar Jar Binks, with the clumsy, computer-generated figure setting the viewer's teeth on edge virtually from the word go. Jar Jar's relentlessly bumbling behavior is compounded by some seriously questionable special effects and Ahmed Best's annoying vocal performance, and it's clear that the character brings the proceedings to a dead stop with each and every appearance (of which there are many). And while both Neeson and McGregor are typically solid in their respective roles, Jake Lloyd's less-than-competent turn as the perky Anakin ensures that one's efforts to form any kind of rooting interesting in the infamous figure fall hopelessly flat. Lucas' notorious reliance on computer-generated effects prevents many high-octane sequences, such as the exciting yet empty podrace, from making the visceral impact one might've anticipated, although, to be fair, there's no denying the effectiveness of certain other action-packed moments sprinkled throughout the film - with the  highlight unquestionably a three-way duel between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Ray Park's scene-stealing Darth Maul. It's ultimately impossible to label Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace as anything more than a passable yet consistently erratic blockbuster, with the movie hardly standing as an ideal introduction into George Lucas' justifiably legendary universe. As perpetually uneven as its underwhelming predecessor, Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones  follows a now-adult Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) as he embarks on an illicit affair with Natalie Portman's Padmé - with the narrative also detailing Obi-Wan Kenobi's (Ewan McGregor) investigation into a failed assassination attempt on Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). It becomes clear fairly early on that writer/director George Lucas intends for Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones  to correct the mistakes of Episode I, as the movie, for the most part, boasts a more adult-oriented sensibility that  proves a refreshing change from the almost non-stop silliness of the earlier film - with the most obvious example of this a severely (and appreciatively) reduced role for Ahmed Best's pointless, annoying Jar Jar Binks. There's little doubt, however, that the heavy emphasis on the burgeoning relationship between Anakin and Padmé hardly fares well at all, with Christensen and Portman's total lack of chemistry together merely the tip of the iceberg in terms of this subplot's ineffectiveness. (It doesn't help, of course, that Lucas floods the proceedings with ill-advised instances of dialogue, including Anakin's infamous ""I don't like sand"" line.) The less-than-enthralling narrative is compounded by Lucas' overuse of computer-generated effects, as there's a pervasive lack of reality to many of the movie's  action-oriented moments - with, for example, a flying car chase through a busy cityscape more cartoonish than anything else. It's ultimately the ongoing emphasis on Star Wars-specific elements that sustains one's interest through the far-too-long running time, with the inherently-compelling nature of many attributes ensuring that Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones  is, at the very least, a watchable big-budget extravaganza. (It'd be nice for a little more substance, of course.) Easily the best of the prequels, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith primarily revolves around Anakin Skywalker's (Hayden Christensen) turn to the Dark Side and the Sith's long-gestating rise to power. Filmmaker George Lucas has, with Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, mostly jettisoned the unfocused, kid-oriented bent of The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, with the increased emphasis on Anakin's story ensuring that the film suffers from few dull spots (eg Obi-Wan Kenobi's investigation from Episode II). The impressively dark atmosphere - Anakin does, after all, murder a room full of children - proves instrumental in both confirming the movie's unqualified success and separating it from its lackluster predecessors, and it's worth noting, too, that Anakin's decision to embrace the Dark Side is handled with a degree of unexpected subtlety by writer/director Lucas (ie it doesn't just come out of nowhere). And while Lucas' penchant for stiff dialogue and simplistic characterizations remains an issue, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith benefits substantially from the ongoing presence of thoroughly electrifying moments - including a mesmerizing scene in which a  menacing Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) espouses the benefits of the Dark Side to Anakin (and even hints that he's the would-be Jedi's father!) The better-than-anticipated atmosphere paves the way for a briskly-paced second half that culminates with an enthralling battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan, with the film's final stretch leading quite nicely into Lucas' original (and superior) trilogy - which, in the end, secures Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith's place as a strong capper to an underwhelming prequel series. Set about 20 years after Revenge of the Sith, Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope follows Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker as he teams up with dashing smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and  Wookiee sidekick Chewbacca to stop Darth Vader from unleashing a planet-destroying weapon. The differences between Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope and its three predecessors could hardly be more vast, as the movie boasts a far simpler (and far more down-to-earth) feel that instantly sets it apart from its frenetic and relentlessly overstuffed forebears - with writer/director George Lucas offering up a straight-forward narrative that is, while not always engrossing, entertaining from start to finish. Ranking high on the film's list of positive attributes is its myriad of affable performances, with Hamill's effective (and affecting) turn as the sympathetic hero matched by an impressively charismatic roster of supporting players. (It's clear, however, that Ford's work as the justifiably iconic Han Solo remains a consistent highlight.) The refreshingly pared-down narrative admittedly does take a while to get going, as Lucas offers up a less-than-engrossing opening half hour revolving around the exploits of droids C-3PO and R2-D2 - with the foundation-laying nature of this stretch paving the way for a midsection that grows more and more compelling as it progresses. And although the final space battle does outstay its welcome by a small margin, Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope ultimately stands as a stirring introduction to such legendary figures as Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia. Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back  continues the storyline established by its immediate predecessor and follows Luke (Mark Hamill), Han (Harrison Ford), and the rest of the rebels as they attempt to stay one step ahead of the villainous Darth Vader. The first Star Wars installment not directed by George Lucas, Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back  nevertheless falls right in line with A New Hope and effectively expands on the universe established in that film - with the narrative  boasting more of the elements that made Episode IV such a success. It's just as clear, however, that the movie suffers from as  uneven a vibe as its forebear, with, especially, the midsection lacking in elements designed to wholeheartedly sustain one's interest. This proves to be especially true of Luke Skywalker's ongoing (and less-than-captivating) training at the hands of Frank Oz's Yoda, as such interludes suffer from a lack of momentum that bring the proceedings to a dead stop at each and every turn. There's little doubt, however, that Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back  benefits substantially from a continued emphasis on absolutely enthralling images and sequences, and it's impossible to deny that the movie, past a certain point, moves like a rocket all the way to its impressively downbeat finale. (It's worth noting, too, that the climactic lightsaber battle between Luke and Vader is just about as engrossing as anything contained within this venerable series.) By the time the cliffhanger ending rolls around, Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back  has lived up to its place as an erratically-paced yet consistently entertaining installment in a not-quite-great sci-fi series. George Lucas' original trilogy comes to a close with Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, with the narrative revolving around the rebels' last-ditch efforts at taking down the Empire and the second Death Star. Filmmaker Richard Marquand, working from a screenplay by Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan, does a fantastic job of immediately launching into the relatively fast-paced proceedings, as the movie kicks off with an exciting opening stretch detailing the rescue of Harrison Ford's Han Solo from the clutches of Jabba the Hutt. From there, however, Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi progresses into an episodic midsection that is, unfortunately, often as padded-out as it is engrossing - with the continuing emphasis on the protagonists' exploits on Ewok home-planet Endor certainly perpetuating the erratic vibe (ie most of this stuff  isn't terribly interesting). It's just as clear, on the other hand, that the film boasts a number of typically stellar moments and sequences, with the entirety of the final act, involving a series of electrifying battles, more than making up for the somewhat lackluster nature of the movie's midsection. (There are a few similarly enthralling quieter scenes as well, including an affecting heart-to-heart conversation that transpires between siblings Luke and Leia.) The charming, feel-good conclusion, in addition to finally putting the Ewoks to good use, ensures that Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi ends on an exceedingly positive note, which secures its place as a capper to a solid trilogy that's nevertheless not quite the flawless work its reputation would seem to indicate. The best, most thrilling Star Wars movie to date, Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens, which picks up about 30 years after the events of Return of the Jedi, follows a former stormtrooper (John Boyega's Finn) and a scrappy scavenger (Daisy Ridley's Rey) as they embark on a quest to track down a long-missing Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). The degree to which Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens  improves upon its six predecessors is nothing short of stunning, as the movie boasts all of the elements one has come to associate with the franchise without, generally speaking, falling prey to its various trappings (including kid-oriented supporting figures and superfluous subplots). This is despite a first half that's occasionally a little slower than one might've preferred, although, by that same token, it's clear that the deliberate pace proves instrumental in establishing and developing the myriad of new characters - with Boyega and Ridley's respective protagonists faring unexpectedly well and more than holding their own opposite series veterans like Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). (This is to say nothing of Adam Driver's consistently magnetic turn as the mysterious Kylo Ren.) The laying-the-groundwork atmosphere is alleviated by a proliferation of thoroughly captivating action sequences and set pieces, including a number of aerial battles that easily rival anything contained within George Lucas' original trilogy in terms of sheer excitement. And while certain elements contained within J.J. Abrams, Michael Arndt, and Lawrence Kasdan's screenplay seem just a little too familiar (eg a planet-destroying super weapon), Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens benefits substantially from an almost astonishingly propulsive final stretch that boasts one enthralling interlude after another - which, in the end, confirms the movie's place as an exceedingly promising first installment in what's sure to be an iconic new trilogy. A stellar, if slightly overlong, followup to 2015's Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens, Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi continues the storyline established by its predecessor and follows several heroic figures as they attempt to quash the First Order's ongoing efforts at ruling the galaxy. Filmmaker Rian Johnson kicks Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi off with a larger-than-life space battle that isn't, admittedly, the most engrossing opening stretch one could've envisioned, as the action-heavy sequence is too chaotic and too disorienting, particularly within a plot that hasn't even begun yet, to make the electrifying impact that Johnson has clearly intended. And although the movie's deliberately-paced first act seems more concerned with laying the groundwork for things to come than with capturing the viewer's undivided attention, Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi progresses into an often electrifying midsection that's rife with engrossing, captivating sequences - as Johnson juices the narrative with a whole host of incredibly spellbinding scenes and digressions (eg a journey to a wealthy planet, a confrontation with Andy Serkis' fearsome Snoke, etc). Johnson's eye-popping visual sensibilities ultimately ensure that Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi is one of the series' most impressive installments  on a purely aesthetic, visceral level (eg that third-act battle on a salt world is nothing short of astounding), and it's clear, too, that the writer/director does a superb job of deepening the characters introduced in Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens and advancing their respective storylines (eg Adam Driver's Kylo Ren, for example, becomes a far more compelling and complex figure in this one). The thoroughly satisfying conclusion only confirms Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi's place as a superior entry within the revitalized space saga, with Johnson's ongoing willingness to make the picture his own (ie he quickly closes the book on the previous movie's various mysteries) ensuring that there's nothing cookie-cutter about this eighth installment."

And it means we can operate without a paywall, too. 1 per cent of people giving means 99 per cent of people get access to quality, fact-based journalism from a talented team of journalists who live and work in B.C., Alberta, and across Canada. We think that’s pretty remarkable.
 The fan boys are busily chewing holes in the carpet over the latest iteration, running down the film’s Rotten Tomatoes score, writing petitions, and marching up and down the interwebs, tootling and farting their frustration.  Stars Wars: The Last Jedi entered theatres this month and has been pulling in the punters, who apparently aren’t too upset with director Rian Johnson’s creative decisions.  Striking the right balance between new ideas (the rise of women, the end of old white men, and a new universe of togetherness) with the same old stuff (explosions, good guys, bad guys, metal guys, fleshy things with noses where their ears should be) is a delicate art. And to be fair, the film hits the sweet spot between mono-mythic hoo-haw, old fashioned space western, and a new age of intersectionality.  It is also the tale of three generations — Boomers, Generation X and Millennials — that incorporates aspects of all three groups, and in so doing forges a new take on an old story.  In the beginning, the original trilogy of Luke, Leia, and Han were ranged against Darth Vader and his army of storm troopers. Thin white colonialists with crisp British accents ruled the universe. Everyone was apparently related to everyone else, while whitey was firmly in control and eager to squash the rebel uprising, like the Empires of old.  In subsequent chapters, as the Star Wars universe proliferated, and things got a bit more expansive, other elements popped in, but nothing reset the clock like The Force Awakens in 2015, when J.J. Abrams brought in the next generation and effectively passed the torch.  This latest version blithely picks up where things left off in The Force Awakens. Young Rey (Daisy Ridley) has gone off to a mysterious island in search of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Leia (Carrie Fisher) is firmly in command of the rebel forces. Runaway storm trooper Finn (John Boyega) is recovering in a cryo-tube, and emo Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is nursing his injuries, both internal and external.  The First Order is preparing to blast the rebel base to mince pie. The rag-taggy group of fighters are fleeing for the stars, and the only thing standing in the way of their complete and total annihilation is a bunch of X-Wing pilots, led by the super scrappy Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac).  The ensuing space battle is suitably operatic and sets the tone for the rest of the film, one part repartee, to two parts shoot-the-shit out of everything. Nothing like heavy casualties to gladden the heart, but the film’s opening sequence is light on its feet, and positively zippy with speed and bravura entrances and exits. Meanwhile, back on the hunk of rock where Luke has come to glower and sulk, a different battle is unfolding. Erstwhile pupil Rey needs a Jedi Master to learn her the ways of the force, but Luke, old and cranky and fed up with religious Jedi bullshit, wants nothing more to do with the stuff.  In yet a third narrative, Kylo Ren has failed his master, Lord Giant Penis-Head, also called Snoke (Andy Serkis), and is suffering the usual growing pains of evil aspirants. Kylo’s granddaddy issues have gotten in the way in his quest for power. Furthermore he is being undermined at work by ginger kiss-up named General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson).  So, all in all it’s a complicated old picture. To its credit, the film juggles the multiple narrative skeins with ease, only occasionally tangling into a Gordian knot in the centre of the universe.  As Rey learns the ways of the Jedi under the ambivalent tutelage of Old Man Skywalker, Kylo Ren is also learning new stuff, like why he and Rey are invisibly bonded through time and space. I will give you three guesses but you will get it on the first try. It’s about time there was more sex in the stars, and Kylo is everyone’s mean space boyfriend, a creamy dreamy man in a mask, with a light sabre and impulse control issues. There is even a spot of nudity. MMMM……cool whip.  As Rey and Kylo circle around each other in their minds, warily at first, and then a bit more heatedly, a new element enters the picture. It is a different kind of conflict, but as old as time itself. Driver gives a particularly visceral performance, wet-lipped, and trembling, you can almost smell the testosterone armpit funk rolling off the man. He is met and matched by Rey, a tough-minded young woman, with ethics aplenty and a chip on her shoulder, comprised of poverty, and abandonment issues.  I smell a space crush happening, even though the pair is effectively on opposite sides of the Manichean universe. Dark meets light, good meets evil, and then they have sex everywhere. Alas! We are not quite there yet. Although, in fan fiction universes, I can well imagine the purplish prose spilling forth.  But back to the actual universe for a moment, as the rebels attempt to flee the long arm of the First Order, their only hope, is to shut down the tracking device, and for that they need a master code-breaker. All of which sets the stage for extended sequences involving lots of near-escapes, courageous sacrifice, and a few startling reveals. If all of this stuff seems rather familiar, it’s because it is, but that doesn’t necessarily detract from the enjoyment factor.  Johnson has a fluid way with battles scenes, ample with balletic movement, that give rise to a kind of violent poetry. Spacecraft, skim over the surface of a planet, kicking up blood red-paths in their wake. So, too, the crackling dance of combat, humming with the blue-white fire of light sabres, is keenly drafted, crisp, and effective.  But here is where fan umbrage seems to be most concentrated. Women occupy the roles of power in the rebellion, against a largely male enemy, and there is a distinct shift away from the old guard. But the most radical aspects of the film slip in sideways, including a critique of war profiteering, greed, and capitalism itself. Perhaps, Rian Johnson is practicing a few Jedi mind tricks of his own, sneaking in a more radical undertone, under the very noses of his audience.  But the thing that makes the film most interesting is its function as a bridge between two paradigms, really two distinct generations, Boomers and Millennials. In this, I would argue that The Last Jedi is a quintessential Gen X film, sporting the snarky humour, self-deprecation, and certain ironic position that marks the population.  Vanity Fair recently featured an article that trumpeted the notion that Gen X folk, born between the early-1960s and the early 1980s, would be the generation to save us. I’m not so sure about this, but they have certainly done a great deal to knit together the Lucas universe (monomythic and obsessed with daddy) to the new more diverse and inclusive star system. Both Rian Johnson (b. 1973), and J.J. Abrams (b. 1966) have brought their particular (generational) sensibilities to bear, in revamping the series, and creating a path forward.  As a proud member of Generation X, I have had the privilege of seeing all eight films in the series in actual movie theatres, starting with the very first chapter. In 1977, my parents took me and my brothers and sister to see the movie, and in 2017, I take my son, and the thing goes on and on. Will it ever end? Maybe, but probably not in mine or your lifetime. And this is just fine. The idea that your kid’s kids may someday troop off to see more Star Wars on whatever future cinematic technology waits in the wings is strangely heartening.  Or, maybe they will sit around the campfire, in the ruins of a post-industrial world and tell tales of Luke, Leia, Darth, Rey, Kylo and Lord Giant Penis-head, and remember a time when people watched pictures made of light and dark.

"Dec 27, 2017",NEGATIVE," A veces no es suficiente una cabeza para pensar una película. Por eso, invitamos a dos de nuestros colaboradores a discutir Star Wars: Los últimos jedi (2017), la entrega más reciente de la saga creada por George Lucas. Iniciamos la conversación con dos preguntas: ¿Qué fue lo que vimos? ¿Por qué creen que hubo una reacción tan mixta ante una película que en el peor de los casos debería limitarse a ser complaciente con su base de fanáticos? Rafael Paz (@pazespa): Pienso que al interior de Los últimos jedi hay dos fuerzas en contastante tensión. Una buscando imponer la visión del director y la otra cumpliendo con las máximas del estudio/equipo de producción (los mismos que decidieron correr a Miller & Lord de la película de Han Solo por quererse pasar de libertinos). Esa tensión entre ambas impide que la cinta tenga un tono definido o, de menos, concreción de ideas. A pesar de durar casi dos horas y media, me da la impresión de que se cuentan muy pocas cosas. Si entras al juego, amarás la cinta; aquellos que marquen distancia, harán exactamente lo contrario. ¿Qué piensas Jorge? JJ Negrete (@jjnegretec): Concuerdo y siento que esta confrontación generacional se refleja tanto en la trama de la película como en su forma: desbalagada, ciertamente ambiciosa y con una copiosa cantidad de ideas y conceptos, muchos de ellos “contrarios” al dogma Jedi. Rian Johnson es un hombre hábil para malabarear ideas ambiciosas aunque en ocasiones termine tropezando con  las mismas (Looper, Brick) y lo que propone aquí no es reverencia a lo Abrams (The Force Awakens), sino iconoclastia y, como tal, un caos espectacular, pero lo que no termino de ver es ¿hacia dónde apunta esto? Considerando que la franquicia regresa a manos de Abrams en la siguiente entrega, seguramente los productores pedirán pulcritud y solemnidad… for old times sake. @pazespa: A más de lo mismo, seguramente. Tal vez Los últimos Jedi sea un fracaso pero al menos apunta a cosas interesantes, hombres llenos de matices y fuera de los extremos simplistas impuestos por George Lucas, en los cuales solo cabe gente buena o mala.

La visión periférica nunca fue un fuerte en Lucas, por algo hemos visto las mismas familias y elementos repetirse hasta el hartazgo (ojalá la identidad de los padres de Rey se quede en el anonímato y no quieran convertirla en una heredera de un viejo clan).

Desde luego que está el clarísimo precedente de Leia en el Episodio VII, pero estaba como mero eye candy y no había algo más profundo.

Creo que el entusiasmo es por la ruptura y el distanciamiento de la gastada visión de Lucas, pero sí comparto esta sensación de desorganización generalizada y nula cohesión que justamente impiden que la película pueda consumar el mancillar (que bonita palabra) el dogma de los Jedi, lo cual esta reventando a un sector de los fanáticos al punto que han hecho una ridícula petición para que la película sea sacada del canon y rehecha de acuerdo a los ideales y principios Jedi. ¿De verdad ya caímos tan bajo? ¿Así de caras las guayabas? @pazespa: La verdad es que ahora la muchachada hierve al primer hervor.

"Dec 26, 2017",POSITIVE," It's epic, exhilarating, endlessly entertaining and easily the best of this new wave of Star Wars movies. Writer/director Rian Johnson has made such a freaking good film that the return of hotshot director JJ Abrams to helm the next one that finishes off this new trilogy feels like a bad move and a step backwards. Unlike the soft reboot of Abrams' 2015's The Force Awakens, which leaned a little too heavily on its source material, or last year's spin-off Rogue One, which failed to have a sense of danger until the last 15 minutes when the crew finally started dropping like flies and Darth Vader showed up, The Last Jedi doesn't repackage old threats or shoehorn in Star Wars fan service at every opportunity. Instead, it tells a rollicking good, high stakes yarn that plays with expectations, throws surprises at you and keeps you guessing until its more than satisfying conclusion. It runs long yes, but there's so much going on and it's so much fun that you really don't feel that time pass. General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) is leading the last scraps of the Rebel fleet as they scramble to escape the relentless pursuit of the First Order. The reformed stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) is on a ticking clock mission to find an expert code breaker and Rey (Daisy Ridley), the wannabe Jedi, is off trying to convince a grizzled, retired Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to leave his hideaway and rejoin the resistance. The weakest of these is Finn's. It's briskly paced and full of action yes, but let's just say a casino is no cantina... Worse, it also sees him interacting with Prequel Trilogy levels of CGI critters. While there are plot ramifications to his mission the main point of his quest seems to be to keep adrenaline levels high between cuts to Rey and Luke's ""Will he Jedi? / Won't he Jedi?"" conversations and Leia's 'stay out of range' space chase. Over on the dark side of the force Adam Driver shakes all the emo out of his Sith apprentice Kylo Ren while still retaining an angsty petulance, violent unpredictability and bouts of uncertainty. We also finally get a good look at Andy Serkis as the Dark Lord Snoke. Sadly a lot about the character remains clouded, but with an already hefty running time of 152 minutes perhaps that's for the best... Pleasingly, however, a decent amount of time is spent delving into Ren's back story, detailing what - and who - drove him to the dark side in the first place. As the storylines start to merge the big setpieces begin kicking off. Lightsabers are used sparingly, but every time they light up they're devastating, brutal and yes, flat out awesome. The big space battle is a full throttle, laser lit affair that thankfully stays focused and never degenerates into a confusing mess of brightly coloured, whizz-bang CGI. And an extended Hoth-esque ground siege, complete with AT-AT's and outgunned yet plucky rebels looks totally amazing and has more than a few fist pumping moments as it blasts its way to its stunning climax and super cool resolution."
"Dec 26, 2017",NEGATIVE," There are quite a few movie options at the multiplex this holiday season. Here are the films you should be spending your hard-earned money on, and the ones you’d best avoid. It costs a lot to take your family to the movies these days. One false move and you’re out two hours and, between the tickets, parking and refreshments, a cool hundred bucks. Why do you think so many people partake in mediocre fare like The Ranch, starring this fucking asshole?  While I’ve already put together a list of the most overlooked movies this year, including little-seen gems Columbus and A Ghost Story—most of which are available to rent or purchase on iTunes or Amazon—and you should definitely make it a point to check out Lady Bird and The Florida Project, two of the very best movies of the year that are still playing in select theaters nationwide, these recommendations concern the films that have recently opened, and that you probably want to check out with your friends or loved ones over the holidays.  Filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson and actor Daniel Day-Lewis, the pair behind the modern masterpiece There Will Be Blood, have reunited for this fine-tailored tale of a 1950s London dressmaker and his muse (the Luxembourgish Vicky Krieps, divine). There isn’t a wasted frame in this, Anderson’s meditation on the push-and-pull that exists between obsessions professional and personal; the performances are first-rate, including Lesley Manville as Day Lewis’ icy sister; and if Jonny Greenwood’s score is not justly rewarded, there will be outrage. Quite the swan song for Day-Lewis, if true.  This year has been frustratingly short on quality comedy films, with the powers that be intent on serving us table scraps like Rough Night, Snatched, Baywatch, The House, and fucking Daddy’s Home 2. So thank goodness for this laugh-riot about the messy making of the best-worst movie ever, The Room. Directed by and starring a stellar James Franco as its eccentric, vampire-clown creator Tommy Wiseau, it’s a hilarious and at times heartwarming film about the lengths people will go to achieve their wildest dreams.  There are people—so, so many people—who will lavish praise upon Steven Spielberg’s Pentagon Papers saga for its perceived timeliness, casting it as a star-filled rebuke to the president’s war on the fourth estate, and by extension, the truth. Don’t believe them. It’s mawkish tripe, filled with scene after scene of agonizing preachiness. There is one moment in particular where Meryl Streep’s publisher exits a courtroom, prompting every woman in the crowd assembled outside to turn and face her in slo-mo-unison, that will make your eyes roll into the back of your head. Plus, at a time when publishers are “pivoting to video” (translation: gutting their editorial departments), is it really all that “timely” to have a film lionize a newspaper owner while diminishing the efforts of the brave whistleblower and dedicated reporters who actually broke the story?  The most sensual film in ages; a transcendent exploration of first lust, first love, and first heartbreak seen through the eyes of a hormonal teenager. That it is set in the ‘80s, and concerns a gay affair between a 17-year-old and a slightly older man only raises the dramatic stakes, amplifying the feelings of crippling self-doubt and romantic ecstasy that are part and parcel with one’s sexual awakening. Luca Guadagnino guides the story with grace, Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer sizzle as the two lovers, and the always-impressive Michael Stuhlbarg delivers the most heart-stirring movie monologue of the year.  Sure, it’s a paint-by-numbers biopic about British Prime Minister Winston Churchill facing down the Nazis, but when the acting is this good, who gives a damn. Gary Oldman, buried under heaps of prosthetics, is an absolute wonder as The British Bulldog, vividly conveying his insecurities, gravitas, humor, and unparalleled charisma. It’s a performance that will likely land Oldman his first Academy Award, and it will be justly earned.  It is, to put it bluntly, a $90 million steaming pile of orc shit. This travesty, directed by David Ayer from a Max Landis screenplay, marks yet another career low for star Will Smith, who has arguably appeared in the worst movie of the year in four of the last five years (Bright, Collateral Beauty, Winter’s Tale, and After Earth). Nothing about this film makes sense, the effects and design look terrible, the dialogue is cringeworthy, it’s bursting at the seams with offensive Chicanx gangland stereotypes, and the actors—save poor Joel Edgerton—all seem to be mailing it in. Oh, and if all that weren’t enough, the screenwriter sounds like a total creep. Hard pass.  There is something to be said for a film that delivers just what you want from it, and this wholly unnecessary sequel to the 1995 Robin Williams-starrer is just that. It’s got fun action set pieces, The Rock oozing charisma, Jack Black and Kevin Hart providing some comic relief, and Guardians of the Galaxy’s Karen Gillan kicking serious ass. What more could you really want from a Jumanji sequel? Fun for the whole family, as they say.  Jessica Chastain is a fine actress. Idris Elba is a fine actor. Aaron Sorkin is one of the greatest screenwriters to ever live. Unfortunately, the three of them flounder here in this, Sorkin’s directorial debut about a “poker madam” overseeing a high-stakes celebrity-filled underground game of Texas Hold’em. The dialogue in this film is just terribly overwritten. At one point, Chastain’s character materializes in the office of her lawyer (Elba) in the middle of the night, riffing on the cosmos; in another, her father (Kevin Costner), in a dreadful display of pater ex machina, pops up out of nowhere to explain (and explain, and explain) their mutual hostility. This one would’ve been far more interesting as a documentary, assuming you could get some of the big-name subjects—Tobey Maguire, Ben Affleck, Alex Rodriguez—to participate. I fell hard for this movie from its very first screening at this year’s Venice Film Festival. Few directors manage to harness the transportive power of cinema quite like Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro, whose exquisite creations—from his period sets to his delicate creatures—continue to inspire awe. This 1960s-set fairy tale, about a mute cleaning lady who falls head over heels for a mysterious sea creature, is made with such tenderness and love that it’s impossible to resist. It is, at times, extraordinary, as during a musical number later in the film, and Sally Hawkins proves the ideal vessel for del Toro, an actress who inspires more goodwill than just about any other.  There is a good film to be made about Tonya Harding, a tragic figure who was unfairly branded “trailer trash” and subsequently shunned from the hoity-toity world of figure skating. This is not it. Despite the best efforts of star Margot Robbie, who shines as the embattled Olympic skater, I, Tonya is an ugly, ugly film masked as a satire/black comedy; a tone-deaf point-and-laugh look at poor rural white Americans that treats its subjects with a surfeit of scorn, and tempers its jarring scenes of domestic violence with comedy. This is Tonya-as-caricature. The real thing is far more engrossing. "

"Dec 23, 2017",POSITIVE," Rian Johnson has created what is easily one of the most complete and well developed “Star Wars” cinematic installments since “Empire.” While it does have the occasional pitfall (Porgs), “The Last Jedi” is a masterstroke for the series so far. Johnson manages to skillfully build on this new universe while also answering a lot of the pressing questions that the fans had for “The Force Awakens.” This is the second film to usher in the new generation and ease out the originals, turning this in to a war where the underdogs are still the rebels and they’re filled with reverence for folks like Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa. Johnson focuses primarily on the “How,” and “Why” questions from “The Force Awakens,” allowing fans closure on a lot of the nagging questions that left them excited and or baffled. All the while we get the sense that while this is a new generation, some things have changed for the better and others simply haven’t. Take for example Benicio Del Toro’s character that presents shades of Han Solo, but is by no means Han Solo. Johnson also does what other writers haven’t done in the movies yet, exploring the seductive realm of the dark side. What does it take to drift in to the dark side and why have some jedi masters and students decided to embrace it? “The Last Jedi” puts its focus on Rey potentially visiting the dark side and being lured in to it by a constant struggle between information on what happened the night Luke and Kylo Ren battled and destroyed all semblance of their relationship. Is Luke secretly a Sith hiding out? Is Kylo Ren merely manipulating Rey? In either case, there’s much more emphases than ever with the efforts to stop the First Order. They’ve begun tracking the rebellion and their have cornered them at every turn, weakening their ranks every time. In an effort to stop them, Fin and new ally Rose venture out to track down a code breaker. Meanwhile after Leia is rendered in a coma after a vicious attack, Poe Dameron begins to butt heads with new leader Vica Admiral Holdo, who is so by the books, Poe begins to suspect she’s a spy. Meanwhile now that Rey has tracked down Luke, she seeks his tutelage as a Jedi to help stop the First Order, and gets more than she bargains for when she realizes she has a psychic connection with Ren, who seeks to give her an explanation as to why he became a Sith lord. For a series seeking to extend the narrative, Johnson thankfully resolves some pressing storylines, as well as opening up potentially disastrous fall out from a myriad moments involving Poe, Rey, and Fin. “The Last Jedi” is a fantastic sequel through the end, in spite of its faults (Yes, the porgs and vultpex’s are very toyetic) it’s a swift and firmly paced follow up that introduces new characters (Rose is a doll) and thankfully doesn’t ape “The Empire Strikes Back.” It seeks its own path as a sequel to the third part in the Skywalker trilogy, while also expanding on the canonical Star Wars Universe."
"Dec 23, 2017",POSITIVE," Has it really been 40 years since the world was first introduced to the young dreamer Luke Skywalker?  It has.  Heck, if you don’t count the brief appearances in Episodes III (as a newborn baby) and VII (the last moment of the film), it’s been 34 years since Luke has been on the big screen.  But those numbers are in the past as the Jedi master finally returns in the eighth chapter of the original saga, “The Last Jedi.” The film begins where “The Force Awakens” left off.  We are there as the galaxy’s newest hero, Rey (Ridley) finally tracks down Skywalker (Hamill) and hands him his old lightsaber.  His reaction is not what she expects.  Meanwhile, the first order, led by General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), both of who are under the power of Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) have closed in on the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa (Fisher, in her final screen role).  As things begin to go from bad to worse, Leia reluctantly begins to trust in the leadership and ideals of ace pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) who in turn butts heads with Vice-Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern).  Can everyone agree on the right path to take or will evil finally win? With a script by director Johnson, “The Last Jedi” is a mash-up of many different stories, but all with the same main plot line; good versus evil.  As Rey tries her best to convince Luke to return with her to help the Resistance, he gives her many reasons why he should not.  Among them is the guilt he feels over how his one time student, Ben Solo – his nephew – has transformed himself into the evil Kylo Ren.  In another part of the galaxy, we discover Finn (John Boyega) on an adventure of his own, one in which he meets the funny and resourceful Rose (a much welcome Kelly Marie Tran).  Rose is one of the many new faces that dot the screen, along with Dern and a wiley Benicio Del Toro.  But don’t despair, there are a few old faces that pop us as well. The cast here is strong, with Hamill’s performance quite powerful.  He’s lived with this character for four decades and it’s obvious he’s invested heavily into it emotionally.  Driver, who came off as a little whiny in “The Force Awakens,” is much stronger here, a sign he has gotten comfortable with the character and its place in the story.  Sadly, this is Carrie Fisher’s last performance as Leia Organa, and the film is dedicated to her.  It’s apparent to me that Princess Leia would have been an integral part of Episode IX and I’m curious as to how they will handle her absence.  And if you’re looking for “cute,” not only is fan favorite droid BB-8 back but we also meet a creature known as a Porg, a puffin-like creature that makes the Ewoks from “Return of the Jedi” look like slugs! To share anymore would necessitate the use of the words SPOILER ALERT and I would rather share less than more.  And with a 2 ½ hour run time, there is plenty I could spill.  But I would rather be dropped into a Sarlac pit then ruin your journey back to the galaxy far, far away.  May the Force be with you!"
"Dec 22, 2017",POSITIVE,"If you can accept the excess, the weird humour, the entirely inessential subplot, and the fact that it could stand to end a scene earlier, then the series will continue to thrive in a galaxy far, far away."
"Dec 22, 2017",NEUTRAL," The galactic civil war goes on, with the Resistance on the run under Gen. Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher, who finished shooting shortly before her death last year) and the Force-savant Rey (Daisy Ridley) seeking to recruit the reclusive Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) back into the struggle. Writer-director Rian Johnson falters a bit, missing the gee-whiz thrill J.J. Abrams gave The Force Awakens—and where Abrams left us eager for more, Johnson leaves us sated and willing to wait a couple of years for the next episode. Still, there’s plenty of fun to be had, and the series faithful won’t be disappointed. Oscar Isaac, John Boyega, Adam Driver, Domhnall Gleeson and Andy Serkis round out the returning cast, with some promising new characters in the form of Laura Dern, Benicio Del Toro and Kelly Marie Tran. The film has great pieces that rarely fit together, and the binary connections that director Guillermo del Toro makes between real-life civil rights struggles and merman love are fairly insulting."
"Dec 22, 2017",POSITIVE," It’s impossible to view The Last Jedi independently from its predecessors. It’s the second instalment of the third trilogy of cinema’s greatest space opera. And it’s very much a product of what came before, but not in the way you might expect. After the ambitious but deeply flawed prequels, The Force Awakens traded originality for nostalgia; a plot driven by coincidence and luck, all to serve reassured thrills. With the franchise safely re-established, Disney has now turned to indie auteur Rian Johnson (director of Looper and Brick) to shake things up. Unusually for a Star Wars film, we pick things up immediately from its predecessor. Rey faces the haggard Luke Skywalker on his island retreat, while the Resistance prepare for confrontation from the First Order, furious following the loss of their Starkiller Base. This is where the pieces begin; and to reveal any more plot is punishable by Sarlacc Pit. After JJ Abrams’ The Force Awakens gave Star Wars lore the respect it earned, Johnson gives it the polite disregard it deserves, not worried to ruffle some feathers to push innovation. It’s far more daring and subverting than previous entries, challenging both character and audience expectations. Established rules of engagement are questioned, sometimes downright mocked; even the dialogue constantly spouts “let the past go” and “this is not going to go the way you think.” The motto here is innovation not commemoration, leading to some of the most inspiring and exciting ideas seen in the series. Character development comes front and centre: every action is caused by what came before and has consequence going forward. For most of the film, the characters are driving the story, not the other way around. Leads Rey, Finn, Kylo and Poe are more nuanced, questioning their instincts and struggling to define right from wrong. The older faces have become wiser, less naïve, and more surprising. Carrie Fisher’s final bow as Leia is another touching and stoic turn, and Mark Hamill’s tortured yet sassy take on old Luke puts Harrison Ford’s sleep-walk performance to shame. The Last Jedi tackles the bigger questions that the morally sure previous entries did not. The Light and Dark side become shades of grey; good and evil become subjective. It keeps you guessing more than Return of the Jedi ever did, and offers a more convincing argument than Revenge of the Sith. The profits of war is a surprising new theme for the series, giving an intellectual depth rarely seen in blockbuster cinema outside of Nolan. Johnson also brings a visual panache to the Saga: vibrant colours spark from the screen as speeders skim across salt flats; lightsabre battles feel grounded while scenes burn around in epic scale; the creature designs are imaginative if not twee, leaning heavily on Studio Ghibli. It finds new and unexpected places to put familiar models, similar to Gareth Edwards’ Rogue One.While a lot of innovations hit, there are misses. The rules of the Force are stretched to breaking point, with a couple of moments leading to puzzled looks around the cinema, even for a film about space magic. The script is flabby; every scene has purpose, but certain aspects feel overlong and jarring. Just like Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, it also suffers several endings too many. Whether you enjoy The Last Jedi will be down to taste. There’s a surprising amount of comedy in the film, quite a bit at the expense of beloved characters or series law; it’s funny, but not respectful. Those who hold the series dear might also struggle with how it plays fast and loose with character and plot twists. Nearly 35 years after the original trilogy, this film will ruin some long imagined happily-ever-afters. Perhaps The Last Jedi is the most unique Star Wars film – it certainly feels different. The Force Awakens was practically a homage, borrowing plot points and constantly referencing fan favourites. However, Johnson’s Jedi much more resembles the original trilogy’s boundless imagination and reckless storytelling. They were never perfect films; cold examination reveals the narrative and logical flaws just the same. But when they hit their heights, there was nothing better in the galaxy."
"Dec 21, 2017",POSITIVE,It is the best and most innovative Star Wars film to come along in a long time and you would think that this would inspire celebration in the streets among longtime fans of the franchise.
"Dec 21, 2017",POSITIVE," “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” the eighth episode in the series that celebrates its 40th anniversary this year, marks the second time that an episode in the franchise has been entrusted to a director whose previous achievements created a buzz of expectation. This first time was back in 1980, when George Lucas gave the second movie in the first “Star Wars” trilogy, “The Empire Strikes Back,” to Irvin Kershner, who until then had made films about contemporary America (the excellent “Loving” and “Up the Sandbox,” for example) which seemed to have very little to do with a galaxy far, far away. In this case the intriguing choice for director is Rian Johnson, who made his debut in 2005 with the surprising, promising “Brick,” a clever mix of high-school movie and film noir, and went on to direct other interesting pictures, such as “The Brothers Bloom” in 2008 and “Looper” in 2012, each of them making distinctive use of the genre to which it belonged."
"Dec 21, 2017",POSITIVE,"""The Last Jedi"" is not a crude predictable entry to the series; Rian Johnson has delivered a luminous spark that's left the future of the franchise looking bright."
"Dec 21, 2017",POSITIVE," ""Dos clichés producen risa. Cien, conmueven"". La frase es de Umberto Eco y la utilizó el escritor y semiólogo para describir el más irrefutable de los placeres culpables. No es lo que están pensando. Él se refería a Casablanca. Sería estúpido quizá comparar la película de Michael Curtiz con la que ahora firma Rian Johnson según el universo de la más redundante y, admitámoslo, cansina de las religiones del nuevo milenio. Eso es Star Wars. Pues bien, es el momento de cometer el sacrilegio: Los últimos Jedi es definitivamente un pecado. Mortal de necesidad y, por ello, difícilmente más placentero. Cliché tras cliché, tópico tras tópico, el director consigue levantar un conmovedor monumento a algo tan rutilante y hasta cursi como la posibilidad de un sueño compartido. Y con fiebre. Y en eso, nos pongamos como nos pongamos, Casablanca y la última entrega de La guerra de las galaxias es lo mismo. Amén. En un ritual solemne como toca, el villano Kylo Ren, el personaje interpretado un Adam Driver recuperado para la causa, hace explícito de qué va todo esto: ""Es el momento de dejar morir a lo viejo"". Lo dice con voz tronante y con el gesto del que traza una raya en el agua. Ése es el mensaje. Recuperar el espíritu de la bestia más rentable de la historia del cine, pero adaptándola a la impunidad de las redes sociales, por así decirlo. Y, a su manera, ésta es la especialidad de su director. Pero no se dejen engañar. Eso es sólo la excusa para curar el complejo de culpa. Puro márketing. En realidad, lo que cuenta no es lo nuevo sino la sensación de reencuentro, la recuperación pausada de un gesto que creíamos olvidado y que identificamos como común. Casi sagrado. A un lado las líneas argumentales por aquello de ir lo más virgen posible al lecho, el que hace el episodio VIII, el más largo de todos, se limita a profundizar en el alma los personajes, en la espectacularidad de las escenas y en la memoria herida de los espectadores con la actitud del que se sabe depositario de una llama por así decir salvífica. No hay más. Se trata de que lo viejo vuelva a tener sentido, no de acabar con ello. Como ya hiciera en Looper o en Brick, Johnson readapta el lenguaje de los géneros de toda la vida (ahora toca la ciencia ficción que no sólo el fantástico) a la caligrafía errática de la mirada que se descompone, la nuestra. La idea no es construir una oda a la nostalgia sino de investigar qué es lo que hace eternos a códigos ya milenarios. Y de este modo se aplica con rigor en la relación triangular de Luke (Mark Hamil) y su nueva familia formada por Rey (Daisy Ridley) y el citado Ren; con paciencia en la detallada descripción de la infinidad de secundarios (nos quedamos con ese dúo compuesto por la siempre Leia-Carrie Fisher y la cada vez más lynchiana Laura Dern), y con humor (quizá demasiado) en las exigencias comerciales de poner a circular para los reyes nuevas criaturas espaciales. Por supuesto, para que ningún cliché quedé sin explotar, por ahí circula la furia de un Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) magnético, un Finn (John Boyega) muy en su papel de 'robaplanos' y, la gran sorpresa, la recién llegada Kelly Marie (Rose). Hay más, pero para qué insistir. Vivimos un tiempo en el que el cine es sólo secuela. Todo lo es, pero el cine más. Ingenuamente, El retorno del Jedi, allá en 1983, se empeñaba en cerrarlo todo. Eso ya no es posible. Ahora todo vuelve y por ello las historias están condenadas a detenerse por siempre. Nadie cuenta ya historias, son ellas las que nos cuentan a nosotros. Johnson lo sabe y como ya ocurriera en El imperio contraataca, la mejor de todas las entregas como saben, la película navega por la placentera ingravidez de un cosmos perfecto. Yo no hacen falta explicaciones para presentar personajes o tramas y, como el capítulo intermedio que es, la película no precisa de final alguno. Todo flota. Y es esta característica de levedad la que, para desesperación de algunos, hace grande a Los últimos Jedi. Johnson se las ingenia para extraer de cada uno de los tópicos que fundamentan el universo galáctico su verdad más incontestable. La emoción. De nuevo: ""Dos clichés producen risa. Cien, conmueven"". Si El amanecer de la fuerza había sido de la mano de JJ Abrams una gran celebración de lo mismo (es decir, significaba la recuperación del mundo que el propio Lucas había condenado en la trilogía de Jar Jar Binks), ahora Los últimos Jedi nos confirman que la memoria resiste en la febril comunión de, otra vez, un sueño compartido. Decía Adam Curtis en su monumental El siglo del yo que la celebración entusiasta del individualismo en la que nos hemos arrojado desde el final de la Segunda Guerra Mundial hasta nuestros días de selfies en Instagram nos ha condenados a estar solos. De ahí que enfermedades latentes como el nacionalismo o el fanatismo furbolero hayan cundido como alternativa a tanto penar en soledad. Es sólo una interpretación. Lo cierto es que Johnson hace su propia lectura liberadora de este asunto en su cinta: también quiere ser ella una contestación crítica a tanto penar en solitario. No es tanto lo eterno renovado, como lo eterno recuperado. El éxtasis del cliché. Eso o Los últimos Jedi como Casablanca. Y para acabar una nota autobiográfica. La película, azares del exotismo, la he visto en Hong Kong. No deja de sorprender ver lo pequeño que es el universo y lo universales que son los lugares comunes. Pese a lo que parece, este último comentario es positivo. Mucho."
"Dec 21, 2017",NEGATIVE," Though he apparently wants this to be the case. In Star Wars: The Force Awakens, fans saw the franchise’s iconic characters Luke, Leia and Hans take a step back from the action – not because they were weaker, but because their aims and means were different now. Playing the hero is a young person’s game. They’ve paid their dues. They’re on hero status maintenance now; the action load is lighter. In the case of Leia and Hans, their new roles were that of leaders; both military and morale. In The Force Awakens, it was their job to guide the new generation of Resistance fighters, and to teach them what they needed to know in order to prevent the First Order from taking over the galaxy. But in The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson’s instalment of the epic space opera franchise, Luke has lost hope that the kids will be alright – and is questioning whether the Jedi were ever alright either. Having isolated himself on the remote planet Ahch-To (aka Skellig Michael, looking worthily mystic), he has nevertheless seen tracked down by the passionate and Force-ful Rey, who is convinced that only he can save the Resistance. When he refuses, she asks him to instead train her – but Luke is fearful by the power he sees in her, having already lost a young protégée to the dark side. The question of whether all power corrupts, and whether anyone is ever purely good or evil, runs through all of The Last Jedi. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is set to take over The First Order, but his mercurial, almost adolescent rage conceals some insecurity and conflict – one that links him to Rey’s personal journey, in an intriguing parallel of potential. But it’s not just about the individuals. The Resistance itself, even in its quest for good, is a violent and militarized force, buying weapons from the same morally bankrupt and insanely wealthy arms dealers that The First Order does. Is motivation enough to separate the two sides, or are they inextricably linked through their methods? There are interesting questions raised by Rian Johnson’s screenplay, however none are explored in depth – despite the film’s absurdly long run-time. Instead, clunky and repetitive dialogue about hope and responsibility are echoed ad nauseum by almost all the major players in their relative subplots – Rey’s interactions with Luke; Finn’s journey to the corrupt casino citadel with an idealistic Resistance maintenance worker Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran); and plucky pilot Poe’s (Oscar Isaac) arguments with the steely-eyed but underdeveloped Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), who knows that leadership isn’t always a handsome young man with a talent for flying and shooting – it can be quiet and thoughtful, as long as the young wans give you the respect you deserve. As all of the conversations circle the same themes without progressing any of them, Johnson tries to inject novelty by introducing new creatures such as adorable Furby-like porgs, based on the puffins the filmmakers saw on Skellig Michael, the majestic but abused racing animals, the Faithers; and the glittering crystal arctic foxes that are discovered on the Resistance’s hideout mineral planet. Some of these -the porgs in particular- feel like a cynical merchandise ploy to appease children, who would understandably get bored as the plot convolutes itself for no apparent reason. Even the scene transitions can feel awkward, as Johnson frequently drops a plot thread to pick up another for thirty seconds of exposition before he bounces off again. This pacing might distract somewhat from the ultimately static character development, but it’s not smoothly executed. Digressive rather than progressive, The Last Jedi fails to develop the new, exciting and complex characters we met in The Force Awakens. Though a spectacle of air-bourne action, ferocious fighting, dramatic intergalactic cityscapes and awe-inspiring natural beauty thanks to our own shores, when surmising the impact of the plot on the franchise as a whole, you may be left shrugging. At one point in The Last Jedi, a character remarks that we must fight to protect the things we love. Let’s hope the Rian Johnson remembers that audiences love plot and progress, not just visuals, because you just know he’s already working on the next instalment, Let me guess, Jedi: The Next Generation?"
"Dec 21, 2017",POSITIVE,"Abrams gave us the gentle re-introduction we needed, and it paved the way for writer and director Rian Johnson to take the story in strange new directions."
"Dec 21, 2017",NEUTRAL," In Star Wars: The Last Jedi, we get our older Luke and Leia movie. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher get to do what Harrison Ford did in The Force Awakens by spending a little more time—in the case of Hamill, a lot more time—in their iconic roles. Both stars shine in their frankly incredible opportunity to play in the Star Wars sandbox 40 years after the original’s release. When this film focuses on the saga of Luke and Rey, it is nothing short of epic. When the camera is fixed on the late Carrie Fisher, who gets more quality screen time than her glorified cameo in Force Awakens, it’s heartwarming and, yes, sad. The Leia stuff gets a little kooky at times, but I’m trying to make this a spoiler-free zone. When writer-director Rian Johnson takes the action to the characters of Poe (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and a new character named Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), the film falters. Poe, so engaging in Force Awakens, seems underdeveloped here. While the Resistance fights an oddly prolonged and bizarre space battle against the First Order, Poe just whines a lot—to the point where you are actually happy when Leia smacks him across his head. The film picks up where The Force Awakens left off, with Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Luke in a staredown. Rey is looking for tutelage, but Luke is in full hermit mode, wants nothing to do with that Jedi stuff anymore, and desires to be left alone with his alien milk. While on the island, Rey starts having some sort of psychic Force conversations with Kylo Ren a.k.a. Ben Solo (Adam Driver). Will Luke train Rey? Will Rey find out who her parents are? Will Adam Driver do obligatory partial nudity in this film? I’m not telling. What I will tell you is that there’s too much going on in The Last Jedi, and a lot of it feels like filler. Besides the aforementioned, stalled-out space battle, there’s a clunky sequence in a casino that goes on far too long, a lot of distracting cameos, and new characters inhabited by Laura Dern and Benicio del Toro, who bring close to nothing to the proceedings. Am I overthinking this? Yeah, of course I am, but I’m a dude who has spent the last 40 years worshipping Star Wars. Anything you put up on the screen within a Star Wars production is going to have the likes of me—admittedly, somewhat of a loser—taking that shit apart. I’m saying some of this movie seems a little half baked, and also overstuffed. If there’s any kind of movie I want to be over two and a half hours long, it’s a Star Wars movie. But, at that length, it needs to be a really good Star Wars movie, not a so-so one. The Last Jedi is so-so. I’m of two worlds when it comes to The Last Jedi. It’s part Best Star Wars Ever (Luke, Leia, Rey, Ben Solo) and part Worst Star Wars Ever (Poe, Finn, the girl with the flip hair, and just about any time Domhnall Gleeson speaks). I’m recommending it for the Luke and Leia goodness, Daisy Ridley’s continued greatness as Rey, and inspired moments of fun and humor. But, man oh man, it goes into “Jar Jar bad” territory a little too often for my tastes. Johnson has been given his own, new Star Wars trilogy to work on, a saga supposedly away from the Skywalkers. I’m hoping the guy gives us something a little more balanced in the future. He’s made great movies (Brick, Looper) and crap movies (The Brothers Bloom) in the past. The Last Jedi falls somewhere in between. So, as Yoda would say, “A great Star Wars this is not. Like it just fine, I did, but there is a tremor of over indulgence in the Force. Be mindful of this for future times in edit bay, you must.”"
"Dec 21, 2017",NEGATIVE,"Although not worse than the prequels for me, The Last Jedi is its own special kind of meh that demonstrates Disney doesn't have the guts to do this franchise any justice."
"Dec 20, 2017",NEUTRAL," Padme Amidala's grim observation as Emperor Palpatine disbanded the Old Republic in favour of the Galactic Empire stands as one of the few successes of script-writing in George Lucas' prequel trilogy. Her words were resounding in my mind as I sat in astonishment among an audience earnestly applauding the conclusion of The Last Jedi. I dismissed the possibility that I was the victim of some Jedi mind trick, and that my fellow cinema-goers had indeed seen the same film that I had. Over-funded, bloated, self-important and virtually immobile, The Last Jedi bears more than a passing resemblance to Jabba the Hutt. I am by no means fond of The Force Awakens but I see now that it does have at least one redeeming quality. The Force Awakens at least knows which of Lucas' original trilogy it seeks to plagiarise. The Last Jedi on the other hand cannot make up its mind and so seeks to emulate all three at various points in its 2hr 32 min runtime. One particularly egregious example sees Snoke, Rey and Kylo Ren act out the throne room scene from Return of the Jedi almost word for word. The final confrontation between the First Order (still a cartoonish farce) and the Resistance is basically the Battle of Hoth with a bit of red thrown in. It is this kind of shameless ""borrowing"" from past (and superior) films that banjaxes The Last Jedi. It feels like fan fiction equipped with the kind of astronomical budget that only the Banking Clan could provide. Even the characters seem vaguely self-aware of the fact that they are in a Star Wars film, taking immense joy in constantly reminding both themselves and the audience. Not a single opportunity is missed to rob a dramatic scene of its gravitas by casually throwing in a quip or one-liner. This is a common trend amongst big-budget action films today, one Joss Whedon is almost exclusively responsible. The biggest problem with The Last Jedi is that it is quite simply boring to watch. The essential premise the action revolves around is like a lockbox, trapping certain characters from doing anything meaningful while the others fumble about for the key. Leia Organa and Poe Dameron spend almost the entire film just sitting on a spaceship waiting to be rescued. Meanwhile, Finn and Rose (a new addition to the principal cast) distract the audience with an overlong and ultimately unnecessary side plot. The most interesting moments are shared between Rey and Luke Skywalker, but even these seem to have little bearing on the overall story. I was looking forward to the return of Luke Skywalker, more so than Mark Hamill was based on some of the content of his interviews. Though broadly disappointing, Luke's scenes stand virtually alone in presenting something thoughtful and original. Luke is no longer the optimistic, ever-hopeful character that redeemed his tormented father. Instead he seems almost to have given up on the idea of redemption, unwilling even to attempt to save the soul of his nephew. Most significantly Luke has given up on the idea of the Jedi, condemning the religion as hubristic and vain. It's an interesting direction for the character and one that is well delivered by Hamill. Yet despite the glimmer of good ideas here and there, The Last Jedi completely fails to invest in any of them long enough for a satisfying pay-off. There is another interesting scene where it is revealed to Finn that the First Order and the Resistance have both been purchasing weapons from the same arms dealers. It is a small moment in which Finn is forced to re-evaluate his role in the great galactic conflict, reminiscent in fact of the stellar Rogue One. It's a shame that small moments like this are lost amidst a restrictive and incoherent main plot. Perhaps as a devoted Star Wars fan I am more attuned to the similarities between The Last Jedi and previous films than more casual viewers. It might even be the case that the kind of fan that has read and enjoyed the likes of Dark Empire and Heir to the Empire could never really appreciate the new canon. I don't think this is true. The aforementioned Rogue One is superb. In the realm of television both Clone Wars and Rebels have demonstrated that good Star Wars stories can still be told (the D-Squad plot line not withstanding). Still, the spirit of the franchise demands that I maintain hope. To that end I shall re-watch Rogue One and remind myself that, yes, there is another. The Last Jedi has a few good ideas but these are utterly lost amidst an over-long and utterly unsatisfying overall plot. Replete with poor dialogue, irritating tonal shifts and superfluous scenes, The Last Jedi adds very little to the saga except an overwhelming sense of disappointment not felt since the release of The Phantom Menace."

"Dec 20, 2017",POSITIVE," If “Star Wars” is religion—as any sacred text with an original trilogy, prequel trilogy, and sequel trilogy would suggest—I lost mine when I saw the Ewoks in “Return of the Jedi” (1983). The moment those teddy bears from Endor cooed, I recognized that the clash between lightness and darkness had been sidelined in order to market stuffed animals to every child in this galaxy. Four movies into the Skywalker Saga, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” a long-latent “Star Wars” affection has been reawakened. Sure, it was nostalgic to see Princess Leia, Han Solo and Chewbacca reunited in “The Force Awakens” (2015). But for the first time since “The Empire Strikes Back” (1980), the audience is treated to a movie that isn’t fueled mostly by nostalgia, the occasional light-saber duel and multiple opportunities to hiss the villains and cheer the heroes. Rian Johnson, the film’s writer and director, honors the franchise’s history as he speeds toward its future, reimagining the galactic multiverse. As in “The Force Awakens,” it’s no longer The Empire versus The Rebels. It’s the First Order (an authoritarian monarchy) obliterating what remains of the Resistance. Any relation between U.S. politics and those in this galaxy far, far away is purely intentional. Snoke is the despotic Supreme Leader of the First Order. In a motion-capture performance, Andy Serkis embodies this scarred, saurian, sinister creature. Snoke’s piercing stare makes his underlings quail. One of them is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), son of Han Solo and Leia, gone to the dark side in “Force Awakens.” But in the court of Snoke, which resembles a cinnabar-and-ebony pagoda, Ren starts to have second thoughts. Also having second thoughts is Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Looking like an Old Testament patriarch in robe and beard, Luke has retreated to Ahch-To, site of the first Jedi Temple. Following him to this wondrous and holy atoll is Rey (Daisy Ridley), the orphan who found her inner Jedi in “The Force Awakens” and longs for Luke’s guidance, particularly in questions about her parentage. Periodically she finds herself in psychic communication with her nemesis, Kylo Ren. Meanwhile, the Resistance—led by Leia (Carrie Fisher in her final role)—is in “last stand” mode inside its shabby redoubt, scrambling for intel against Snoke and his stormtroopers. Ably defending Leia are Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), Commander Poe Dameron (Oscar Issac, crafty and funny) and Finn (John Boyega), stormtrooper-turned-Resistance fighter. Cross-cutting at lightspeed velocity among these three parallel storylines, Johnson adds a fourth. It’s a reconnaissance mission involving Finn and Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), a maintenance worker at Resistance HQ. The two set out to Canto Bight, a casino for First Order one-percenters. Imagine the Trump Taj Mahal with an adjacent racetrack where space horses compete against one another and are subject to animal cruelty. It’s in this extended segment that the priorities of the First Order (conspicuous consumption, drinking, posturing) and those of the Resistance (humanism, empathy) are seen in high relief. Admittedly, there are cuddly creatures in Johnson’s movie: They are there either to make a philosophical point or to provide comic relief. The porgs, puffinlike birds that roll their big eyes like vaudeville comics, are examples of the latter. Still, it’s not the creatures but the characters in “The Last Jedi” that truly stand out here. With Johnson at the helm, the torch—along with the lightsaber—is safely passed to a new generation."
"Dec 20, 2017",POSITIVE,the most interesting people are no longer related to Darth Vader
"Dec 20, 2017",POSITIVE," With the overwhelming critic praise surrounding Star Wars: The Last Jedi, my expectations and excitement grew more and more each passing day leading up to opening night. I was literally a bouncing ball around my office waiting for the work day to end so I could delve into the next chapter of the Skywalker saga. Unfortunately, the hype that had been built up throughout the week did not match the film I would see that evening. Don’t get me wrong, this was a really good Star Wars film, rating it number four out of all the previous films( behind A New Hope, Empire and The Force Awakens) but it definitely does not in my mind surpass The Empire Strikes Back and it is definitely not the best film in the entire saga. Leaving the theater, I felt as though maybe I missed something. I couldn’t stop thinking about the film when I got home, unable to drift off to sleep – so I know it was good. I couldn’t understand what other critics saw in the film that I had not. It wasn’t until Rotten Tomatoes released the fan score that I finally understood, that I wasn’t alone.With a critic score of 94% at the time of this article but a fan score of 57%, there was something amiss in The Last Jedi. I understood my disconnect was because I saw the move as a fan and not a critic – and I expected more. Now don’t get me wrong. See.This.Film. It is not to be missed. And do not let anyone spoil it for you.But if you are looking for the best Star Wars film ever made, this is not the film you are looking for.Star Wars: The Last JediStar Wars: The Last Jedi picks up where J.J. Abrams had left us two years earlier. Rey (Daisy Ridley) has found Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and the lush green island in her mind with the hopes of beginning her training and returning the old Jedi Master to the front lines of The Resistance. Yet, moving forward from the past becomes more difficult than she could possibly have imagined – the eternal fight between the light and the dark burning from within.source: Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesWhile Rey attempts to complete her mission, The Resistance carries on the battle against the New Order. With Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) and their obedient army hot on their trail, General Leia (Carrie Fisher) leads the fight for their survival and the survival of hope throughout the galaxy.Honestly, after watching The Last Jedi, I was even more overjoyed that J.J. Abrams would be returning to complete the saga. Almost immediately, you can sense that there is a lack of heart put into the characters and the plot versus The Force Awakens. Where The Force Awakens felt like it was a film made by a truly devoted fan, The Last Jedi feels as though it was at times thrown together as director/ writer Rian Johnson went along. When a director has to explain the film to its fans, there is some serious disconnect and a ponderance on whether the fan was actually considered.Many have complained or commented on the length of The Last Jedi. It did start to feel long towards the end, yet I don’t think it was due to the actual time stamp of the film. Instead, I believe it is because of the drawn out plots within the film itself. Many parts of the story are over showcased destroying the strength and believability in the plot. Though some of the storylines and character development really worked in the film, there were others that made me feel cheated as an audience member and a fan.As Luke Skywalker states in the trailer “This is not going to go the way you think!”CharactersRegarding the various characters within The Last Jedi, there were highs and there were lows. Some characters seemed unnecessary and out of place – their purpose in the film and for the plot was confusing. In all honesty, it seemed as though these characters were added only for the possibility of setting up Rian Johnson’s new trilogy that would continue outside of the Skywalker line.source: Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesPorgs for one, while undeniably adorable, had no purpose in this film. Yes, they do add some comedic relief, but are unnecessary. The Force Awakens brought back the traditional, savvy and clever humor of the original films, using the characters and a small white and orange droid to bring humor to the film. In The Last Jedi, Porgs are the equivalent to the use of Jar-Jar Binks in the prequels to bring the humor – yet thankfully less annoying.Characters introduced in The Force Awakens were underutilized in The Last Jedi and there importance seemed severely altered, becoming only a means to move the plot forward and not the saga. They are not apart of the story as they once were. Now this is not to say this applies to every character introduced in the previous film, but there is a shocking abandonment of characters that could have played a larger role.Though, it wasn’t all bad. It was amazing to see Mark Hamill once again reprise the role of Luke Skywalker, the intense fire behind his eyes untainted in the years since the final film. This was one of the best parts of the film for me, an icon of my childhood that I would mimic brought back to life. Needless to say my inner child was beside itself.Yet, where my inner child was bursting at the seems, it was also heartbroken. Carrie Fisher’s final performance on screen was sad yet satisfying. Her final film as Princess Leia was fitting and properly handled. There is a moment when fans will find her performance truly reminiscent and truly satisfying – I know I did and will probably never for get it.TechnicalWhile there is only so much about The Last Jedi you can actually say before running the risk of spoilers, there is one element of the film I continue to praise and use as a selling point to see it. The battle sequences are phenomenal, some of the shots and framing are top notch and permanently etched in my mind. They are beautifully choreographed and are epic representations of good vs. evil, light vs. dark. For this reason, I highly regretting choosing recliner seating at my local theater over the IMAX.source: Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesOne technical complaint, however, was with the use of the music at one point in the film. It can be said that many of the films John Williams has composed carry a similar sound. John Williams sounds like John Williams, his music encompassing classic after classic and his “sound” recognized by many.He has managed though to maintain a “sound” while still assembling an identity to each film he scores. Yet, this is the first time I have honestly recognized another film score within a film. At one point in The Last Jedi, the score of Jurassic Park can be heard inlayed with the score for a particular scene involving a casino ridden planet. This to me was the most annoying part of the film. Nit picking I know, but music has the ability to draw you into a film and mesmerize, but it also has the ability to rip you out just as quickly. In a moment of tension, I was ripped out of The Last Jedi and thrown, for a moment, into a completely different film.ConclusionWhile a good Star Wars film, this was not the best. With issues across the board (technical, character and plot), The Last Jedi does leave much to be desired.Have you seen Star Wars: The Last Jedi? What did you think?

Characters introduced in The Force Awakens were underutilized in The Last Jedi and there importance seemed severely altered, becoming only a means to move the plot forward and not the saga. They are not apart of the story as they once were. Now this is not to say this applies to every character introduced in the previous film, but there is a shocking abandonment of characters that could have played a larger role. Though, it wasn’t all bad. It was amazing to see Mark Hamill once again reprise the role of Luke Skywalker, the intense fire behind his eyes untainted in the years since the final film. This was one of the best parts of the film for me, an icon of my childhood that I would mimic brought back to life. Needless to say my inner child was beside itself.Yet, where my inner child was bursting at the seems, it was also heartbroken. Carrie Fisher’s final performance on screen was sad yet satisfying. Her final film as Princess Leia was fitting and properly handled. There is a moment when fans will find her performance truly reminiscent and truly satisfying – I know I did and will probably never for get it.TechnicalWhile there is only so much about The Last Jedi you can actually say before running the risk of spoilers, there is one element of the film I continue to praise and use as a selling point to see it. The battle sequences are phenomenal, some of the shots and framing are top notch and permanently etched in my mind. They are beautifully choreographed and are epic representations of good vs. evil, light vs. dark. For this reason, I highly regretting choosing recliner seating at my local theater over the IMAX.source: Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesOne technical complaint, however, was with the use of the music at one point in the film. It can be said that many of the films John Williams has composed carry a similar sound. John Williams sounds like John Williams, his music encompassing classic after classic and his “sound” recognized by many.He has managed though to maintain a “sound” while still assembling an identity to each film he scores. Yet, this is the first time I have honestly recognized another film score within a film. At one point in The Last Jedi, the score of Jurassic Park can be heard inlayed with the score for a particular scene involving a casino ridden planet. This to me was the most annoying part of the film. Nit picking I know, but music has the ability to draw you into a film and mesmerize, but it also has the ability to rip you out just as quickly. In a moment of tension, I was ripped out of The Last Jedi and thrown, for a moment, into a completely different film.ConclusionWhile a good Star Wars film, this was not the best. With issues across the board (technical, character and plot), The Last Jedi does leave much to be desired.Have you seen Star Wars: The Last Jedi? What did you think?

"Dec 19, 2017",POSITIVE,"Undoubtedly, Johnson is able to make some notable moments. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Dec 19, 2017",POSITIVE," The Last Jedi is action-packed, thrilling, surprisingly funny, has several unpredictable twists and contains character moments that, in time, will overshadow all that action and adventure. It’s also a cathartic experience for original Star Wars fans like myself. I can’t wait to see it several more times. And I have not said that about a Star Wars movie in a long time… a long time.  When it comes to arguing about Star Wars, fans or, more accurately, “people on the internet” really let the hate flow through them. And this fandom civil war that has broken out over The Last Jedi is particularly brutal. Or perhaps the negative voices are just a bit louder. But opinions in this arena are often irrelevant as the barometer by which modern success at the movies is measured is Republic credits. But let’s cast aside box office for a moment, your reaction to Star Wars is your own and probably very personal. I’m no different. In order to really talk about The Last Jedi, discussion of key story points and spoilers is necessary, so here’s your one warning. The story covers familiar territory–the Rebels, I mean, Resistance is on the run from the Empire, I mean, First Order. A new apprentice strong in the Force seeks out a master for her Jedi training and guidance and the secret of her lineage. Space battles, political intrigue, characters in peril, pure evil, lightsaber fights, choosing the path of light or dark, plus something cute thrown in as a distraction. Oh, and hilarity ensues, perhaps more than some would like. But I really enjoyed the humor because it is an important part of the mix of elements that make a Star Wars film work. The things that succeeded, worked incredibly well. Equally, the things that did not hit the mark, failed badly but did not ruin the film overall.  The opening battle scene is a whirlwind of starship mayhem — we’ve never seen an X-Wing in a battle quite like that. And it was refreshing to care about a side character with little screen time who makes the ultimate sacrifice. This was not just a collection of cool starship shots jumbled together to form an action sequence, the goal for the battle is made clear with the Resistance attack on a fearsome Dreadnaught ship. While all of this is happening, the human element is never forgotten — there are people aboard those ships and consequences for our characters in the Resistance on the run.  Rey’s arrival and subsequent training on Ahch-To has just the right amount of dire seriousness and situational humor. There are even moments here where Last Jedi feels like an art film, in particular, Rey’s encounter in the cave.  Old man Luke is like a reinvention of the character as we knew him in the original trilogy. Mark Hamill has outdone himself in his best acting as Luke Skywalker. Luke may be a legend in the Star Wars universe, but his human side really comes out during these scenes. We see the pain and regret in that face as he realizes his family may have, yet again, thrown the galaxy in turmoil.  Kylo Ren and Rey’s odd and still unexplained relationship is the most interesting part of Last Jedi. Initially that bond forms over a kind of Jedi Snapchat as the two connect over some Force-driven galactic version of the internet of the mind. At one point, the composition even makes it appear they are chatting over a computer. Women might identify Kylo as some creeper who reaches out over Facebook. Kylo is seen shirtless in one exchange and Rey even asks him to put something on. Those scenes do really feel like some predatory male going after a woman on social media. And even after Kylo and Rey join forces to battle Snoke’s red-armored minons (who I’m sure have a name, but whatever) Kylo then tries to “neg” Rey by revealing that her parents were “nobodies.” He’s actually negging her! I’m pretty sure that Johnson is commenting on creepy and manipulative men who take advantage of women online, or I could be reading too much into it. I’ll let the internet argue over that one.  And then there is Snoke, who somehow drew so much speculation as the new big baddie in the sequel trilogy. After such a big build up, Snoke is cut down like nothing. I honestly believe that Snoke’s origins aren’t all that interesting and his character is just a distraction from the more important issues. But, just for fun, I am going to theorize that the Snoke that was killed in Last Jedi was a clone. That’s right, Clone Snoke! At least that’s the theory I plan to spread on the internet so that it can be debated for the next two years. (And if you are reading this JJ, feel free to use that idea. Also, post with the hashtag #CloneSnoke.) When you remember what you love most about Star Wars, it’s probably not the action, the most memorable parts are character moments. And there are so many to discuss, from Leia saving herself with the Force, the Snoke betrayal just as Snoke talking about how he can never be betrayed, the Kylo-Rey teaming up, old man Luke’s daily routine, the Chuck Norris-looking Luke taking on the First Order alone and on and on.  But what worked best of all was the tone. This felt like a Star Wars movie in every way and brought me back to my childhood. Tone is really the most important contribution of the director and Rian Johnson nails it in every sense. And especially with regard to the humor. Even the controversial Porgs provide just enough funny and cute moments. Johnson went so far as to acknowledge the inevitable hate for anything cute by including a scene of a freshly cooked “Cornish Porg” about to be eaten by Chewbacca as the eyes of gaggle of Porgs look on heartbroken, it’s brilliantly hilarious. Okay, not exactly dark, but here’s what didn’t quite work for me, first and foremost, the running time. This film did not need to be 152 minutes and should have been closer to the 120 minute standard established by the earlier films. I hope one day we’ll see a fan cut that is actually closer to two hours.  Finn’s storyline overall is the weakest, though his journey actually takes an interesting turn in the final battle on Crait. Finn finally learns that becoming a hero requires acts of self-sacrifice. And surprisingly, he finally learned to pilot a ship because if I recall in The Force Awakens which took place maybe a few days before Last Jedi, Finn needed a pilot to flee the First Order and escape his life as a Stormtrooper. So that was fast.  Benicio Del Toro’s character DJ has the most uninspired “Star Wars” name in the Star Wars galaxy. DJ. And Benicio’s acting choice to add a stammer was just cringe-inducing. I would not miss that character if he were cut entirely. The Resistance rag-tag fleet being chased by the First Order felt a little Battlestar Galactic-ish, which would have been fine had this not been a thread through the entire film. The conflicts on those Resistance ships felt a little forced and seemed to be made to fill up screen time. I also was annoyed at the use of the terms “big a*s” and “Godspeed.” Language is important in a Star Wars film and shouldn’t sound too earthy. It really doesn’t matter if we know what a nerf herder is, because we understand what it means in context. Isn’t “God” in the Star Wars Universe the Force? Or, as Threepio put it, the Maker. After pointing out all these weaknesses, it might appear that I like The Last Jedi much less. Far from it. Half the fun of seeing a new Star Wars movie is arguing and debating every single minute detail. For me, this kind of nitpicking is actually enjoyable. In our fractured culture, making something intended to appeal to everyone seems difficult enough these days, and I realize that things that didn’t work for me, might have worked for you. The best part is that it gives each of us a little something to nitpick!  The Porgs are kind of a mixed bag because as they are used in the film, they kind of work. And we actually see one skewered over a hot fire to the horror of Porg onlookers. Johnson understands that a cute element is necessary in Star Wars, but it works best when the screen time for those cute things is kept at a minimum. The Porgs appear just enough not to be an irritant, like, say, Jar Jar. That floppy-eared and clumsy Gungan had so much screen time in The Phantom Menace that Jar Jar ruined the story by becoming too much of a focus. This is a more inclusive Star Wars because that’s what our world is. So diversity with Star Wars characters should be expected or better, not even noticed at all, because we live in a diverse culture with all types of people. But frankly, it took long enough because Star Trek has been doing that since 1966. We’ve come a long way since an all white male fighter squadron and characters named “Porkins,” who was probably given that name because of his portly figure. (Which is kind of lazy and dumb, but I will still love Porkins.) Audiences may not have been expecting a Star Wars movie that also comments on animal cruelty, war profiteering, eating meat, and predatory behavior by men toward women online.  George Lucas has been quoted many times that the original Star Wars trilogy was his commentary on the Viet Nam War. The prequel trilogy is about how a democracy can decay and slowly become a dictatorship. So the Star Wars films have had messages all along, you just might not have noticed them. I do find it surprising that The Last Jedi comments directly on selling weapons to both sides of the war. In spite of the fact that I enjoyed it so much, there’s a lot that what I wish was different. Chatting with friends after an opening night screening, we all thought aloud about things that could improve The Last Jedi. Benicio Del Toro’s character should have been Lando Calrissian. It’s pretty easy to imagine Lando hanging around a casino planet and running hacker scams to make a few bucks. And there’s no mention at all of Lando in this sequel trilogy, so either he’s dead or he’s just not considered a close friend anymore. It should have been Leia that made the ultimate sacrifice on the remaining star cruiser that saved the Resistance by going into hyperspace. It was an admirable end to Laura Dern’s Admiral Holdo character, but it seemed more like something Leia would have done. It was also suggested that Last Jedi could have ended on a cliffhanger with Luke standing to face the First Order alone and then… credits. Sure, we would’ve been upset, but the anticipation for the next film would have been off the charts.  It’s also worth noting that this Star Wars film broke the storytelling format set by George Lucas more than any other movie. The Last Jedi has the fewest “wipes” from one scene to the next than any other Star Wars movie. Flashbacks are used to tell the story of Ben Solo’s motivation for his turn to the Dark Side. Flashbacks as a storytelling device have never been used in a Star Wars film unless you count “Force visions.” Even the line, “I’ve got a bad feeling about this,” is nowhere to be found (though Rian Johnson says that BB-8 is the one who says it at the beginning, which is kind of a cop out). There is a strange visual joke that references the very first Star Wars parody film, Hardware Wars. It’s nice to see such creative thinking applied to Star Wars, because when you rigidly stick to a format, you get what you expect. Or you retread old territory as was done with The Force Awakens. I’m sure many remember the above quote when Empire first came out. Okay, truth be told, that’s a fake quote, but it accurately reflected the sentiment among my friends and others when we discussed the first Star Wars sequel at length.  Seriously, I remember when The Empire Strikes Back first came out. The audience gasped, booed and was angry that the film ended on a cliffhanger. And back then, Star Wars movies were a long three year wait. There was no internet to complain about it, just perhaps the letters column in magazines like Starlog. Conventions were just starting to crop up but they mostly just sold comics. And there was no fan community to seek out support or to debate how you felt. Episode V initially received mixed reviews, good and bad. It was only years later, after the original trilogy was complete that a revisionist history hailed Empire as the best of the three holy scriptures, I mean, movies. Audiences were mad when Empire debuted because it was so different than Star Wars and completely not what they were expecting… which seems to be very similar to what people are saying about The Last Jedi. To be clear, I’m saying Last Jedi is comparable to Empire only in that both received mixed reaction upon their original release. I will end by saying this is the most I’ve applauded, the loudest I’ve laughed and the hardest I’ve cheered for a Star Wars film since 1983. I might’ve cried a few times too. Bravo. What Rian Johnson and company have delivered is a film that took risks, it was unexpected and special. After two viewings of The Last Jedi, I’m struck with how profoundly I was affected. I’m high. I’m high and I haven’t been this high since I was 12. High on Star Wars. I honestly haven’t loved, truly loved a Star Wars movie this much since I was a kid.  And because the film ended with Luke Skywalker fading away as the sun set, something about this feels final. There’s a sense of closure. Which makes The Last Jedi an incredibly cathartic experience. For me, Star Wars is over. I’m finished and it’s done. Sure, I’ll see each new movie as it comes out, but I am oddly satisfied because this felt like the conclusion of the Star Wars I grew up with and I’m happy about that. At peace actually. It’s time for my fandom to end. Star Wars has finally grown up and maybe we all can too. It’s time for that little boy with the broomstick at the end to pick up a lightsaber. I’m pretty sure he could take on the whole Empire.  Great review Chris. I’m as conflicted as Kylo Ren about this movie. About halfway through it I found myself adding up the flaws, but realized I was enjoying it anyway. I had the realization that my love for all the previous Star Wars movies has been not despite the flaws, but BECAUSE of them.  I didn’t think this film was as original as many are claiming. It’s outline is basically The Empire Strikes Back thrown in a blender with Luke doing his best Clint Eastwood from “Gran Torino” and a “ships running out of gas” plot stolen from Battlestar Galactica. BUT there were some GREAT Star Wars moments in it. Having animals save the day twice felt very much like something Lucas would do. The last half hour was so enjoyable and sad at the same time. And Luke’s new take on the Force echoed my own thoughts on it, although I still disagree with his character turning his back on the galaxy for years.  Snokes death means that Episode 9 can’t be a rehash of Return of the Jedi, so I’m good with that.  It was also Kylo, mistakenly, thinking he was finishing what Vader started. Now that they’ve finished that story line I’m curious to see what they do next,  and whether or not Kylo was lying to Rey about her parents. I still think he could have been.  And while I wish the fans would be more civil to each other, I love that this movie has started new debates about what Star Wars is, and what the Force is. Feels like 1980 again. Just more people to argue with.  Great review Chris. I also thought it was odd that Leia wasn’t the one to stay behind on the cruiser until the scene where we have Luke saying goodbye. I think the fans deserved that scene, and the opportunity to see these two legends on screen together for the last time. Even more poignant when you realize Leia knew he wasn’t actually there the whole time, but she embraced the hope he inspired in everyone in that base. Luke said goodbye for all of us, and I for one needed that. I also enjoyed the film a lot. It’s amazing what happens when you hire someone who can write a good script and work with actors. Rian Johnson knows how to honor the existing mythology while putting his own stamp on the material. As for diversity, it may seem silly to some, but as an Asian person, it actually means something to me that miss tran is in this movie. The Disney Star Wars is woke. I’d like to comment only on the dark.  I agree with the casino scenes, as they felt forced (no pun intended).  I am not the biggest fan of Rose, not to say I dislike her.  Unlike Chris Gore (huge fan since the G4 days!), I loved Benicio’s character, DJ (Don’t Join).  I believe his character is relevant to our reality that is so decisive, and extreme on two sides.  The middle ground is not represented and ignored in our world.  It was great to see a character that despises “the big machine” have a fifteen minutes of fame in the movie.  I wouldn’t mind seeing him in a future Star Wars film in some capacity.  I wasn’t the biggest fan of Leia saving herself, but I do understand the survival of her character was vital to the film playing out.  I can’t think of anything else, at the moment, but I’m sure I will, as soon as I read the next review. The point of Canto Bight was supposed to be to find the “codebreaker”.. They didnt do that at all, ended up with DJ and all he did was stick a (paperclip) into a door panel to unlock a door.
1. couldnt a droid have unclocked the door, theye been doing it since day one.
2. if thats all they needed to do WHY EVEN GO TO CANTO BIGHT???
It was obviously just to  introduce Rose to the mix, but agreed, I wish they removed the entire  sub plot, I hated it. You say “I honestly believe that Snoke’s origins aren’t all that interesting”.. well we never got to know his origins at all so not sure how they wouldnt be interesting or not. I was taking you literally, but Im assuming you werent being literal.
Same goes for Reys parents. My theory is Abrams had ideas in mind for BOTH of these huge questions, but after all the fan theories Johnson said “I want to surprise people, but all the best ideas are ruined thanks to fan theories… I know, ill do the EXACT OPPOSITE and make them all nobodies!!!, nobody will see it coming ill ill look like a genius!!!”. This is my gut feeling and I don’t think it worked. I dont think he did it to make for a better story, or to “clean the slate”. I think he did it just to surprise us with something NOBODY guessed. Unfortunately he did it at the expense of the entire movie. Nobody “really” knows but Johnson though. I was a bit disappointing with the “training” on Ahch to. it consisted of 1 lesson for a minute or so, some yelling then Rey training herself for 5 minutes with a rock. I would have liked to see SOME training.
The cave scene was annoying to me. She trips on acid for a bit, then learns absolutely nothing, then just shrugs the entire thing off and leaves. I at least wanted this scene to hold as much gravitas as Luke battling Vader on Degobah only to find his own face behind the mask. I GET that it did accomplish the same thing. “Rey sees her own face in the mirror” but like I said, it had no “gravitas”.  It felt accidental and pointless when it wasnt supposed to be at all. I didnt like that Johnson went in that direction with it. Give us fear, give us suspense this is a “dark side” cave, make it feel like a nightmare. I wasnt happy with the space Leia scene, but i would have been less happy if thats how she died. Agreed she should have taken Holdo’s place.
I wasnt thrilled to see her blasting through doors with the force like Yoda suddenly does in the prequels. I get she is connected to the Force but it was a big jump visually. One more thing.. I wholeheartedly think Luke should have stuck around for IX. his ghosting at the end didnt need to happen. His story isnt done as much as Johnson says it is. He created Kylo weather he likes it or not. and Rey still needs training. she got 1 minute of training. I would have liked to see her come back for thorough training in IX. Luke either dies in IX or even doesnt. You dont have to “kill” him to complete his story. He could just live out his life normally and die of old age. .. but oh well. Luke could still return for IX because he became one with the force and just like Yoda can reappear as a ghost. Luke is pretty much immortal at this point and can do anything including training Rey from beyong the grave if he wanted to. The accuracy of these few statements cuts my Star Wars heart to the core and yet excites me because we are now no longer held down to a precedent that Star Wars movies HAVE to be a certain way. After the credits began to role I turned to my brother and said “This feels weird. It’s over. We’ve lost all three of them now.” Everything I grew up loving about Star Wars is done. Yet I know that opening up the world to new characters/story-lines etc will give me an opportunity to grow deeper roots into a fandom that I hold so dear to my heart. The only dispute I have with the review is the thought of Leia being the one to punch the ship to light speed. While as bad a*s as it would have been to see her go that way, I needed her to see Luke one last time. That closing scene with the two of them had to happen. So much overwhelming grief came upon me in that moment. As a fan I needed their goodbye to happen. It killed me when she didn’t really say goodbye to Han. Maybe that is just my biased opinion. Ha! This movie was amazing. I don’t understand the hate towards it. But thank you for writing such a well versed review. I’ve been waiting patiently for this review, Chris. Thank you & well said. “The Last Jedi” was everything I hoped “The Force Awakens” would be, but wasn’t. On the Dark Side, I absolutely agree about the running time, the casino planet scenes, the misuse of modern language in the Star Wars universe & your Holdo/Leia comments. (Holdo’s attack on the Star Destroyer was one of the highlights for me and I agree it would have been great to give that scene to Leia. But allow me to throw a curveball: Han Solo deserved to go out in such a beautiful & heroic way.) The Light Side: The fact that the above issues don’t severely detract from real moments of wonder, excitement, kickassery and RESPECT of the original trilogy speaks to Rian Johnson’s skills as a writer, director and fan. Yep, the best “Skywalker-family” Star Wars film in 30+ years. Chris, you captured exactly how I felt about this film.  I was 13 when I saw Star Wars and this film came closest to evoking the same kind of emotional pay off. Really well written review.  By the way did you see it at The Americana in Detroit like me? When an internet company decides to investigate a series of 'Screamer' videos, they are confronted with havoc and hell they could never expect.

"Dec 19, 2017",POSITIVE," The last few days have seemed like Official Argue About Star Wars Days, and with a stuffed-to-bursting two and a half hour movie, there’s lots to argue about. My dominant impression of The Last Jedi is as a course correction, and one the series sorely needed. While I found Rogue One disappointing, I understand why people liked it. In a word, texture. Ben Mendolsohn’s Gore-Tex cape whipping in the wind as he walked through the morning mist on the black sand beach planet was a particular highlight, but the whole thing was suffused those kinds of tactile contrasts — supple leather gloves, the orange canvassy vests of the rebels, the stormtroopers who seemed to be made of iPod cases (fascism is smooth and sleek like an Apple product, while the Rebellion tends toward boxy and grey and Soviet-ish). Being able to sense that through the screen seems superficial but it’s not. It’s the difference between being transported to a world and feeling like you’re looking at costumes. The prequels never managed that, and almost everything felt like a pixel-deep facsimile, from the CGI to the dialogue. As much as Rogue One was a triumph of production design, narratively it was a disappointment, and not just because the entire story lives in a kind of pointless middle chapter. It also established glorious suicide as part of the Star Wars canon and seemed to confirm that being a major character in this story was basically a hereditary title.  (Darth is Luke’s Father! Han is Kylo’s father! Rey’s parents are almost certainly important!) At the time, I pointed out that so many characters muttering before committing suicide reminded me a little of an ISIS video. Another writer called this take “vile,” and on some level, I get it. I compared your favorite childhood thing to ISIS. But hey, that was the imagery. I promise I don’t go into a Star Wars movie hoping to be reminded of ISIS. Moreover, I understand being accused of a “vile take,” because to me, The Glorious Suicide is a vile trope. It’s meant to make a grand statement about the mission being more important than the man, the collective being more important than the individual, to highlight one character’s ultimate unselfishness, and fine, it does accomplish that. But the more you see it, and the more lazily it’s used (like when Forest Whitaker’s Saw Gerrera offed himself five minutes after we’d met him to keep from having to walk too fast, say), the more you start to sense its corollary. That corollary being, the inability to respect another living creature’s right to live, irrespective of what they can do for you. It’s impossible to say “the mission is more important than the man” over and over without it degrading your respect for individual lives. Thus it’s hard for me to see the rise of the Glorious Suicide trope without connecting it in some way to the public decline in empathy. A screenwriter saying “eh, f*ck this character, they aren’t important,” ignores that character’s humanity in some way. The same way we all ignore each other’s humanity when we do all manner of terrible things to each other. Which, yes, seems like it’s gotten worse in the era of constant online draggings — if not on a colonial atrocity level, then at least on a personal, day-to-day meanness level. I’ve become so inured to it that when a Last Jedi character fired up the Randy Quaid mobile to drive it straight into that gun barrel/alien gun/portal and incinerate himself to save the galaxy/rebellion/rec center (I’m keeping this vague to avoid the no spoiler Gestapo), I’d already prepared myself to accept this bit of momentarily lazy plotting. Like giant portals or the expanded universe, I thought suicidal characters were just something I would have to learn to accept in order to enjoy a blockbuster in 2017. But this time, just when the would-be Quaid mobile was about to save Earth (so to speak), another character swooped in and stopped Quaid, nearly suiciding to prevent a suicide. We could argue about hypocritical tactics, but Rian Johnson gave the Quaid stopper the perfect line, about how The Resistance is “about saving what we love, not destroying what we hate.” I always found Star Wars‘ simplistic moral universe — the dark side vs. the light — to be vague and not particularly useful and even a little Calvinist. But in this one moment, it felt like Rian Johnson had breathed new life into Star Wars‘ musty philosophy. It still had the melodrama and moral simplicity of the space opera the story is supposed to be, but it suddenly felt current, applicable to the moment and not just an outdated parable. It did what a good blockbuster is supposed to do, appeal to your squishy center just enough to keep you from rolling your eyes. In an even more refreshing update to the universe, Johnson upended the value of heredity. When we found out Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker’s father in Empire Strikes Back, it felt like a fun twist. “Daddy Issues” is an age-old plot device, and useful enough that it still defines every Aaron Sorkin script. But seven movies or so later, it seemed like we’d gone from one character having a surprise father to every major character being related. As if the “light side vs the dark side” wasn’t hokey enough, we were being asked to care about it not just as a matter of philosophy, but as a dynastic struggle. It wasn’t just old fashioned, it was practically medieval, and you nearly had to approach it like reading medieval history. We were nearly at the point where you’d have to look at a family tree before the movie in order to understand it, like the Skywalkers and Solos were the Lancastrians and the Yorks.

Disney has a bit of an atrocious track record when it comes to using royal birth to validate its protagonists’ specialness, so I had no reason to believe the Star Wars universe would improve since it was absorbed by the Disney Death Star. To their credit, Rian Johnson and/or Disney took The Last Jedi as an opportunity to firmly repudiate the value of noble blood (or in this case, magic blood) in the canon. Which is… nice. Our institutions are already so lousy with the failsons of industrial royalty that the last thing we need in our fantasy is more paeans to inherited power. I know, I know, Star Wars shouldn’t be political, but that’s exactly why it was important for The Last Jedi to firmly disavow inherited power — so I can watch the laser fights and laugh at the dog-man and space penguins without having to think about our born rich fish stick-eating president and his brood of chinless latter-day Hapsburgs he keeps trying to gift chunks of the empire. The Last Jedi is still overstuffed, slightly too long, reliant on some vaguely-defined powers, and mostly consists of an endless chase towards a shifting MacGuffin. But it’s always been that. Now at least it’s not that plus being philosophically bankrupt and vaguely ideologically distasteful. Star Wars isn’t intellectual or morally complex, and we don’t really want it to be. All we want from it, aside from being cool to look at, is for it to be simplistic for the right reasons. And now it feels like it is."
"Dec 19, 2017",POSITIVE," The Resistance is all but futile as the First Order strikes back in this ominous midpoint of Lucasfilm’s ‘sequel trilogy’; but Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker gets his long-awaited cinematic due, Adam Driver’s turncoat Kylo Ren offers rare character complexity and Rian Johnson directs even the comic critters with wit and skill. In his 1980 parody song Yoda (to the tune of The Kinks’ Lola), Weird Al Yankovic imagines the plight of Mark Hamill/Luke Skywalker circa The Empire Strikes Back: “The long-term contract that I had to sign says I’ll be making these movies till the end of time.” The viewpoint character of George Lucas’s original Star Wars trilogy, Hamill’s Luke suffered somewhat – upstaged by his cooler friends and relations, removed from the happy ending allotted to Princess Leia (Luke’s putative love interest, until she turned out to be his sister) and Han Solo, and shunted off to be the equivalent of a hermit monk while the rest of the galaxy far, far away got on with business. While Harrison Ford became a major movie star/grouch icon and Carrie Fisher a notable writer/wit, Hamill was wandering through low-rent stuff like The Guyver (1991), Time Runner (1993) and the remake of Village of the Damned (1995), doing his most impassioned work as the demented voice of the Joker on various animated Batman projects. For Hamill and Luke, Rian Johnson’s entry in the long-running series (given the pastiche of chapter-play format, it should perhaps be labelled a serial) is a belated opportunity to get their due. Glimpsed at the end of J.J. Abrams’s Star Wars The Force Awakens (2015), Hamill finally dominates a Star Wars film as a grizzled, regretful presence – a former apprentice turned master, contemplating his many failures yet returning with the grey gone from his beard for a climax in which he stands up to a ridiculously overwhelming attack (“Fire every gun we have at that man,” snarls his nephew-nemesis) and departs mysteriously. The previous instalment was a last hurrah for Ford in this universe – though Han Solo is due back in a prequel next year – but this is all about Hamill, with a side reverence for the genuinely departed Carrie Fisher (who cedes a little space to Laura Dern’s chic Vice Admiral Holdo). It’s a valedictory entry, as obviously patterned on The Empire Strikes Back as The Force Awakens was on Star Wars (1977), though Johnson plays more tricks on long-term fans who think they can detect where character arcs are going. In Empire, Luke and his master Yoda are separated from the rest of the gang on a spiritual retreat/training exercise; here, Daisy Ridley’s Rey nags the reluctant master to school her in the ways of the Force, while a large cast of old and new friends and enemies struggle through their own subplots and a great many awe-inspiring explosions. Like Empire, this chronicles a disastrous period for the Resistance – a term, incidentally, taken from The Force Awakens and embraced by real-world critics of President Trump – because penultimate episodes must take us to the brink of disaster before a valiant rally in the final chapter. All the heroes’ plans fail – which means John Boyega and new face Kelly Marie Tran spend most of the film haring down a plot cul-de-sac – and the cause of good only avoids extermination by kamikaze gestures. There’s plenty of emotion and spectacle, with Adam Driver’s Ben Solo/Kylo Ren the most complicated character in the entire saga, and a terrific final skirmish on a planet whose salty white topsoil churns to reveal blood-red dirt as men and machines scramble against each other. Johnson, unlike Abrams or Gareth Edwards in the 2016 flashback entry Rogue One, leavens political high seriousness and fan-service tear-jerking with enough charm and humour to prevent The Last Jedi becoming the biggest downer ever delivered at Christmas by the Walt Disney Company. Star Wars has a poor track record with cuteness and comedy – no one is clamouring for the return of the Ewoks or Jar Jar – but the guinea pig/penguin/puffin-like Porgs, natives of Skywalker’s island retreat, infest odd corners of the film (and the Millennium Falcon) without becoming cloying. The neatest inside joke has what seems to be a shot of a landing spaceship turn out to be a steam iron, paying back a ribbing administered long ago and far away in the first and best of the Star Wars parodies, Ernie Fosselius’s short Hardware Wars (1978). At one point, Johnson – probably the best director to sign up for the franchise and certainly the best writer-director – has droid R2D2 spur on a disconsolate Luke by replaying the ‘you’re my only hope’ holo-message from Leia that kicked off the whole saga in Star Wars. It’s an achievement that this particular tale of defeat and death – by the end of the film, the entire rebel alliance can fit in one small spaceship – can convincingly deliver its own spark of hope… an abused stable boy on a backwater world, head full of the tales of Luke Skywalker, plays with a broom as if it were a light sabre, and looks to the stars for adventure in a just cause."
"Dec 19, 2017",NEUTRAL,"More good things and fewer bad things happen in this movie than in any of the three prequels, but the film is hellbent on presenting its good things in the worst possible light."
"Dec 19, 2017",POSITIVE," What The Last Jedi, opening Thursday night, does so well over its two-hour, 32-minute thrill-ride is start to escape the gravitational pull of orbiting the same Skywalker family squabbles on the big screen for 40 years. This saga now belongs to a new generation of heroes — Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) and my 13-year-old daughter’s generation off it. Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker, one year older at the time of filming Episode VIII as Sir Alec Guinness was shooting the first “Star Wars,” is now the grizzled, old mentor leaving the heavy lifting (of rocks) to the new kid. But that’s not to say there isn’t plenty in this newest installment that creator George Lucas would recognize: The First Order don’t pretend to be anything but groupies of the Empire from the original trilogy; there are the requisite lightsaber and X-wing battles; there are still enough cute droids and critters to stock the local toy store. There’s enough new and different in The Last Jedi, particularly the depth of the millennials now riding in the Millennium Falcon, to make it time for me to hand over the lightsaber to my own daughter off screen. (That’s not a metaphor, unfortunately, in our household.) And that’s no small statement for a life-long fan who was so inspired by that first viewing as a four-year-old that he became a film journalist and pop culture critic instead of say, going into a lucrative career in business or medicine. (Curse you, Lucas!) “What you have to understand, and I’m saying this for myself, is it’s not mine anymore, and it’s not George’s anymore” the 66-year-old Hamill told this critic for a New York Daily News article. “This is for a new generation…and their goals are much different. “The challenge of making it relevant and entertaining and fun again and also the fact that Disney has invested so much to make it a series that potentially go on for long after (my generation) will be gone.” Of course, 40- and 50-somethings can still enjoy director Rian Johnson’s tribute to the sci-fi franchise that clearly dominated his own childhood. But we’ll say it’s only the second-best installment, after 1980’s The Empire Strikes Back — clearly. Younger movie-goers will likely think that order backwards. See, Disney didn’t invest $4.05 billion in cash and stock to pry Lucasfilm out of George Lucas’s hands a few years ago not to mine every last Kyber crystal out of this franchise. There was no way to do that over the long-term by just continuing to the nostalgia of the grownup kids who first heard John Williams’s epic score in the movie theater in 1977 or first stared at Luke Skywalker staring at the twin suns of Tatooine via a VHS tape. Sure, even the great George Lucas himself tried that strategy once upon a time… with the poorly received prequel trilogy. The pratfall comedy of Jar Jar Binks was aimed at a new batch of four-year-olds, not movie-goers who had seen the original 1977 classic when they were four. So for a long time, the franchise has felt like something stuck a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. Sure J.J. Abrams navigated it well with the last installment, The Force Awakens, but that episode felt almost like a set from a great cover band. Even the standalone films don’t stray too many parsecs from the original trilogy — with last year’s Rogue One a puzzle piece with the edges lining up directly with the first Star Wars. This is the first step in a new direction, even if it’s in just a slightly new direction, and thus the great unknown. If nothing else, with The Last Jedi, Johnson showed why Lucasfilm was so eager to plant him in the director’s chair for a brand-new trilogy with brand-new characters. “These movies in some way are all about adolescence, about navigating the waters between childhood and adulthood and finding your place in the world,” Johnson told me by email. “As a kid in Colorado, I saw this farm kid who feels like he’s a million miles from anywhere but knows he’s on the cusp of stepping into a bigger world, and just instantly responded to it."
"Dec 18, 2017",POSITIVE," “This isn’t going to go the way you think it is,” snarls grizzled old hermit Luke Skywalker halfway through writer-director Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi, which for a Statement of Purposes makes a clever contrast with Max Von Sydow cooing “This will begin to make things right” at the start of J.J. Abrams’ gently placating The Force Awakens. The ninth Star Wars film –which is somehow still only Episode VIII because they make these things all out of order and nobody can figure out how to number them anymore—is the most thrilling since the second (or fifth, depending on who’s doing the counting.) It’s a funny, rousing space adventure that sends the saga in surprising new directions and is by far the most elegantly crafted of all the films. Here’s the first Star Wars movie since Empire that you don’t have to make excuses for enjoying. Taking structural cues from that beloved second (or fifth) installment, The Last Jedi finds our rebels on the run and scatters the cast into separate storylines which are nimbly crosscut throughout. But whereas The Force Awakens was content to be an almost beat-for-beat remake of the 1977 Star Wars (we do not call it A New Hope in this household), this sequel sets up familiar scenes from The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi only to subvert and upend the expected. As demonstrated in Johnson’s previous pictures – like the nifty teenage noir Brick or the tricky, time-travelling Looper – he’s got a big affinity for sleight-of-hand, occasionally indulging in a twist or two too many to keep catching the audience off-guard. In short, nothing goes the way you think it will. Johnson (literally) burns the Jedi temple to the ground, walking back a lot of Abrams’ more regrettable storytelling choices from The Force Awakens while approaching the material with considerably less reverence and quite a bit more artistry. The last film ended with John Williams’ music swelling as Daisy Ridley’s plucky heroine Rey formally presented old Skywalker with his long-lost lightsaber, so this one begins with Luke callously tossing it over his shoulder and going about his day. Moments later we see Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren removing that stupid Spaceballs helmet he wore for no reason in the previous picture and smashing it into a thousand pieces. It’s a movie very much about itself, interrogating the outsized role this mythology plays in our culture, from the shots of little kids playing with makeshift Luke Skywalker action figures to Mark Hamill’s revelatory performance as a broken-down Jedi Master haunted by his failures. Like any astute viewer of the Star Wars series, Luke has come to the conclusion that his ancient religious army’s batting average ain’t exactly great, and maybe this whole Jedi thing should be retired once and for all. On a similar note, since the First Order is basically a Galactic Empire cover band with Andy Serkis’ Supreme Leader Snoke a poor Palpatine poseur, Driver wrecking that silly helmet is the first step in Kylo Ren becoming more than just a cosplayer wearing his grandpa’s clothes. The former Ben Solo has already killed his father, and now seeks to wipe out the past entirely so he can claim the future as his own. The central thematic preoccupation of The Last Jedi is how much of that past should we let die and what about it should we fight to preserve? It’s a conflict that’s even cooked into the film’s aesthetic choices, as Johnson films familiar Star Wars hallmarks from new and unexpected angles, departing from the series’ “house style” to incorporate impressionistic slow-motion sequences and Kubrickian silences. Shot on crisp 35mm by cinematographer Steve Yedlin, The Last Jedi is a movie of sometimes staggering beauty. You’ll gasp at a set of deep red curtains that later burst into flames, creating a rain of embers before a field of stars. Even better is a mining planet where a top layer of white salt covers crimson sands beneath, so during battle the ground itself appears to be bleeding. There’s real visual poetry here. Johnson embraces and extends George Lucas’ original Akira Kurosawa fetish, incorporating visual nods to Kagemusha and Ran while borrowing a bit of Rashomon for the most important backstory reveal. (He also lets Oscar Isaac quote The Wild Bunch and Princess Leia paraphrases Rio Bravo, in case you were wondering why the film spoke so specifically to me.) I’ll never begin to comprehend Abrams’ insistence on keeping the original trio of Luke, Han and Leia apart for The Force Awakens, a dopey miscalculation that feels even more egregious now that Carrie Fisher’s gone. But I’m relieved to report our princess is just terrific in The Last Jedi, putting a whiskey-voiced, sardonic spin on General Organa’s lines (the best of which Johnson has admitted Fisher penned for herself.) She shares a bit of banter with Vice Admiral Laura Dern that made my heart briefly soar, and then break all over again when noticing how obviously the next film was being set up as a showcase for Leia. Much like The Empire Strikes Back, there’s not a lot of winning in The Last Jedi. It’s a movie where victory often means escaping by the skin of your teeth, and an old friend reminds us that there’s no teacher better than failure. Johnson’s revisionism extends even to the heroics, positioning impetuous flyboy Oscar Isaac at loggerheads with Fisher and Dern’s cooler-headed tacticians. (I loved when Leia tells him to “get his head out of his cockpit.”) Hotshots tend to come up short here, which isn’t always a crowd-pleasing dramatic choice but feels like a refreshingly necessary one in a movie so concerned with the after-effects of pop myths. What a treat it is to have a giant-scale franchise blockbuster executed on this level of craft and care, with a story that’s actually trying to be about something more than just selling toys and spinning off sequels. The Last Jedi reminded me of Creed in that it finds a ridiculously talented young filmmaker infusing a familiar series with fresh ideas, honoring the past but not bound by it, bringing a beloved saga thrillingly into the present."
"Dec 18, 2017",POSITIVE," This is not going to go the way you think,” Luke Skywalker says to… well, someone who needs to hear it. Someone whose arrogance is borne of shortsightedness and narrow expectations. And this is also Star Wars: The Last Jedi’s word of warning to the audience. To us. This is the Star Wars movie, after all, from writer-director Rian Johnson, the guy who gave us The Brothers Bloom, a tricksy movie about con artists that knows we go into a movie about con artists with certain assumptions about what we’re about to see. (He also gave us the temporally twisting Looper, in which things did not go the expected way.) This is The Force Awakens’s Empire Strikes Back. We know it, and Johnson knows we know it, and he is going to play with every anticipation he knows we will be bringing into his little space opera action fantasy. And, indeed, there are many callbacks to Empire here: the smallest ones are visual, and often clever (the rebel-hideaway planet that looks like Hoth is covered not with snow but with salt) or shiver-inducing (Imperial walkers stomping across that salt!), but those are ultimately inconsequential. (The movie gets a bit ahead of itself with the Porgs, small, *ahem*, chickenlike birds, which are almost but not quite the sequel trilogy’s Ewoks, from Return of the Jedi.) The significant callbacks are the ones that tease our nerdy conjectures but pay them off in ways that make it impossible to call this a xerox of Empire. The relationship of Rey (Daisy Ridley: Murder on the Orient Express), who is strong with the Force, and Jedi Master Luke (Mark Hamill: Kingsman: The Secret Service, Battle for Terra), and her sojourn on the rocky water planet of his self-exile might recall Luke’s visit to Yoda on Dagobah — there’s even a forbidding tree where Rey makes a discovery about the Force — but this will be very different for both of them. Snoke (CGI’d Andy Serkis: War for the Planet of the Apes, Avengers: Age of Ultron), who is strong with the Dark Side of the Force and is the galaxy’s new evil overlord, and Kylo (Adam Driver: Logan Lucky, Silence), his apprentice, have a dynamic that might echo that of the Emperor and Vader, but that’s not quite what’s going on here either. We await what must surely be the inevitable confrontation between Rey and Kylo, and when it comes, it’s stunning in a way that upends everything we think we know about where this sort of story can go. And of course we’re all waiting for something on a par with “No, Luke, I am your father” as the reveal of Rey’s mysterious parentage… and it’s not like we were even expecting the parallel reveal in Empire: it came out of nowhere. I’m not sure The Last Jedi — aka Star Wars: Episode VIII — will make any sense at all to those who haven’t seen The Force Awakens, and it certainly won’t resonate as deeply, I can’t imagine, with anyone who has not been steeped in the Star Wars mythos for the last 40 years. Because the truly surprising things here — don’t worry; I’m not gonna spoil — are not moments of action or revelation but rather thematic in nature… and they are all reactions to that iconic mythos. Recall that in Awakens, Rey was astonished to learn that Luke Skywalker and the Jedi Knights were — are — real, not merely stories. And Luke here is very deeply concerned with the disconnect between the realities of how the Jedi order use the Force, and the fantasy of the Jedi of legend that Rey (and the Resistance, and the entire galaxy) has in her head. Luke’s concerns also serve as a commentary on the reverence that fandom holds Luke in, and Rian Johnson doesn’t give a whit what we might think Luke deserves as a continuation for his long character arc. Johnson also hints that the Force might be due for something of a Reformation, and that’s not going to sit well with some fans. Previously the series had been deeply concerned with matters of great bloodlines — princesses and priests — but Last Jedi centers characters who are ordinary people: Finn (John Boyega: Detroit, Half of a Yellow Sun), the deserting Stormtrooper who worked sanitation back on the Starkiller Base of Awakens, is back, and teams up with Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), a maintenance engineer on a Resistance ship, for a grand subplot of an adventure in a casino planet that seems to be the galaxy’s Monaco. That takes the film through an exploration of the massive divide between rich and poor in the galaxy that feels very familiar. (We’ve never had much of a sense of the galactic economy before, and there’s not much escapist fantasy to it.) The Jedi are not so amazing after all, and we shouldn’t revere them. You are not your parents, or your grandparents, and you make your own destiny. This is all a bold new direction for the Star Wars series (at least as represented by the movies), and audacity like this is precisely what was needed if it is going to continue without feeling redundant. But perhaps most astonishing of all is the lashing Johnson delivers to the very notion of stereotypical heroics, the stuff the Star Wars saga has been built on: Selfish heroics do not win the day. Real heroism is quiet and self-sacrificing, not boisterous and self-aggrandizing. Some of this is explored in the story thread involving Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac: X-Men: Apocalypse, Mojave) and Resistance leader Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern: The Founder, 99 Homes), who deems him a “trigger-happy flyboy.” If Poe felt like the Han Solo stand-in for The Force Awakens, the kind of stunts Han Solo once pulled are directly criticized here, and not only through Poe. All of the women of Last Jedi, here at what feels like a last stand for the Resistance against the evil First Order, have just about had it with men thinking they can get away with being jerks if they’re also “heroic.” Some stuff doesn’t work. There’s a moment that is meant to, I think, show how someone is unexpectedly strong with the Force, but it’s pretty laughable. The resolution to Poe’s subplot is almost exactly the opposite of what it should be (I hope this will be dealt with in Episode IX). Some of what happens on the casino planet — called Canto Bight, and sure to figure in the next film — is goofy on a level as cringe-inducing as things we saw in the prequel trilogy; like, Jar-Jar Binks–awful. But mostly, this is a terrific film, and truly exciting as Star Wars. It is full of humor and courage and often dazzling and even shocking imagery. The last appearance by Carrie Fisher (Maps to the Stars, The Women) as Princess turned General Leia Organa is powerfully poignant, not least because it involves a passing of the torch to the next generation of badass women, characters who stand in for all the little-girl fans who took inspiration from Leia when she was even more of an anomaly than a robust female character is now. And as much as the film’s title — The Last Jedi — sounds apocalyptic, it’s eventually hugely hopeful. Though I’m still left with the same sort of sense of dread and terrible suspense I felt as an 11-year-old in 1980, flattened back into my seat by the ending of The Empire Strikes Back, worrying how I was possibly going to survive the whole three years before finding out how Han, Luke, and Leia were going to get out of their fine mess. (Fortunately, it’s only two years till Episode IX.) Things seem very much worse for Rey, Finn, Poe, Rose, and the rest at this juncture. That Rian Johnson has managed to make me both hopeful and hopeless at the same time is a wonder. “If everyone is super, no one will be.” (Syndrome)  Instead of making Rey epic, they made her ordinary. But the whole reason Luke and Leia were epic is because they were the offspring of Anakin? The amount of lore and cannon the writers and director take a dump on in this movie is epic. Participation ribbon social crap has killed what was truly special about the Star Wars universe. In 1980, I waited four hours in line to see The Empire Strikes Back…Now thanks to Disney and EA…I no longer feel the force. I’m a children’s librarian. Last week, I ran a program called “You Deserve a Medal.” Anyone who felt underappreciated could explain why they deserved an award, and we presented them with a medal made out of foil and construction paper. I’ve heard a rumor that much of the viewer down-voting on Rotten Tomatoes may have been a bot army set up by one of the “Bring back the EU” die-hards. I wonder what the RT audience score for Empire would have been. “This is not going to go the way you think” could easily apply to anyone coming in with expectations based on the first film. No it is actual upset fans. The film is crap and doesn’t deserve the money it is raking in.  Remember to demand you money back by the theaters (i know it will hurt the theaters feelings but it has to be done otherwise we keep getting this SJW crap!)  The pro critics is more likely being paid off by Disney for good reviews, well that or they just have bad taste in films like this critic. Theaters don’t have feelings to hurt. But if you want to ask for your money back at a cinema, you need to do so within the first few minutes of the movie starting. You can’t sit through the entire film and then expect to get a refund merely because you had political differences with the film! once you have sat through the entire movie, you will not (and should not) get your money back.  going to the movies is a gamble.  you may like it, you may not.  i worked in movie theatres for a couple of years… and that was a thing i got tired of:  “i didn’t like the movie, i want my money back.”  but you sat through the whole movie.  “but i didn’t like it…” too. feckin’. bad. I have watched this movie three times, and I still for the life of me cannot see what the “SJW crap” people keep complaining about is. There is literally nothing in the film that preaches anything like social justice. Is casting people other than white men really all it takes to set people off? I guess I’ll play Peter’s advocate.  Yes, you are partially correct: placing nonwhite and/or female characters at the center of a story previously dominated by white males is enough for a work to be classified as “SJW crap” and trigger indignant shockwaves in certain knuckledragging, wannabe pickup artist corners of the internet, but a plethora of the dudeliest dudebros love Rogue One which includes a diverse range of characters, so progressive casting is not TLJ’s only offense in their eyes. 1)  Rey is good at everything and flawless, and therefore a Mary Sue.
2)  Holdo is presented as a strong female leader who puts Poe in his place, but she is actually a poor leader.
3)  Finn and Rose are diversity hires who have no important roles to play in the story. Although I agree with these complaints to some degree (I’d argue that Luke is just as bland and naturally skilled as Rey) and think TLJ is a mediocre movie (like all SW films except Empire), these are structural flaws in the storytelling that can easily be fixed while preserving the casting.  TLJ’s most vocal haters seem to erroneously believe that all of the disappointing aspects are a direct result of the casting decisions.  I’d say that the main problem is too many characters, period. It also tapped into their pre-existing fears about being replaced and losing their privileged spot in geekdom, and SJWs are a convenient political scapegoat for these fears and other general feelings of disappointment.  It didn’t help that TFA was directed by a myopic corporate hack with all the imagination of a stale Triscuit, a man who’s made a career producing loud, shiny action flicks for tweens.  I at least give Johnson credit for having a vision and trying to do something new.  I wish Darth Disneyous could have given him one final chance to finish what J.J. Binks started. In no particular order:
1. The prequel trilogy had very few of the characters from the original. I’m not entirely sure what people expected from a trilogy set a generation later. Leia is there, Luke is very prominent in TLJ, Yoda makes his requisite appearance, you have the son of Han Solo and Leia…What more do people want?
2. I find it highly, highly amusing that in a series that focuses on not one but TWO Super-Speshul white male Chosen Ones, people are calling Rey, who basically repeats Luke’s actions and fails to turn the evil man good (Kylo clearly kills Snoke for his own ambition), a Mary Sue. It’s the endless, endless pattern: Steve Rogers is a hero. Carol Danvers is a Mary Sue.  3. Poe committed mutiny, and is the primary reason that Admiral Holdo’s plan didn’t work and most of the Resistance died. But Finn (who did a great deal in the previous movie) and Rose (who had one of the most emotional stories in the movie) are “diversity hires”? This gets back to white male default casting: no one asks why Poe is cast as a white male. Cast anyone else, and suddenly, everything about that character becomes a “why?” And now I’ve spent way more time arguing this than I intended, but it all comes down to this: I will be a week’s salary that none of these whiny fanboys would be complaining a whit if, like the original trilogy, everyone but maybe two people were white men, if Rey were Ray and Finn were white and Rose were male. That’s interesting but kind of reaching. I mean, I always find names interesting, but do you think it says anything about Han Solo that he’s named after a significant Chinese dynasty and the name many ethnic Chinese still use for themselves?
There is obviously some “chosen one” status to Rey; there almost always is in any story involving a hero with preternatural abilities. But how many people complained about Luke back in the day? And I haven’t heard anyone complaining about Poe being the Bestest Pilot in the Galaxy.
(Edited for tone. I have a nasty migraine and am getting some stupid comments on my FB pics from Pride, so I’m prickly. My apologies.) George Lucas does tend to get a lot of character and place names from Asian culture and I always got the impression that not everyone was cool with that. Especially since like Joss Whedon, he likes borrowing from Asian culture but doesn’t seem all that eager to write characters of Asian descent. Yeah, I love Firefly, but “How Much Is That Geisha In The Window” (a fan vid that the Librarian of Congress used as part of its decision that fan vidders need to be allowed to pull high-def video from DVDs) is hard to ignore. I’ve read a lot of essays from various writers taking Whedon to task for certain aspects of that show but for some reason, I never came across a mention of that fan vid. Or perhaps I did and I blanked it out for some odd reason. You can find it on Archive of Our Own (Hugo Award winner! The archive, I mean.) If you just google the title, it’s one of the first links. You make good points, and I think you’re right about a parallel universe identical script with mostly white male characters receiving a lot less hate.  I still talk to lots of otherwise reasonable dudes who soberly insist to me that Episode II and II are really not that bad and actually maybe kind of good.  These people are so loyal to the brand that the Siren song of buzzing lightsabers and laser blasts has stoppered their ears to the soggy thud of listless line delivery.  If they can overlook the painful scripts of the prequel trilogy, a little green milk and some hyperspace shenanigans should slip right past their bad movie deflector shields. I think diversity hires are fantastic if they’re incorporated into the stories well and have strong ties to the other characters in the film.  Many people felt, as you do, that Rose was the emotional core of the film, and as an Asian American, I was stoked to see some more representation after Donnie Yen was wasted in a typecast role.  Unfortunately, none of the Finn/Rose plot elements added anything of value or interest for me, and Gwendoline Christie was criminally underused.  TLJ was an ambitious mess with its heart in the right place which is better than average for a SW movie. All that said, I can’t wait to see how ol’ JJ manages to guide this lumbering behemoth of a franchise back to the stable.  He’s a great student of film with technical prowess, a solid work ethic, a talented cast, and virtually unlimited resources, I want to see him finally break free of his influences and produce something surprising, new, and clearly in his own style.  Slapping some lens flare on your favorite Spielberg shots isn’t enough.  Do your own thing and own it J.J.! You also make some good points. I mean, I can see why people would say the Finn/Rose stuff is extraneous. I’m a character-based reader/viewer, so anything that develops characters is going to be way more interesting to me than, say, plot with flat characters. Other people privilege plot, and that’s cool  (I’ve read studies that say men tend to privilege plot and women characterization, but that was like 25 years ago, so who knows?). It’s just that you are quite literally the first person I’ve seen divorce that question from the actors being non-white and, in the case of Rose, non-male. It’s hard to have a serious conversation about plot and character development when “SJW” comes out as soon as you drill down half an inch, if not before.
Thank you for taking the time to discuss this with me. It’s been a pleasure. Actually in many places the writers took exactly what was in the previous films and based what they did on what was done in those films rather than what they say they are — the reality rather than the legends. The legend the earlier films present is the Jedi as peace loving and wise. The reailty — as Luke expresses in this film — is that they were warriors who made key mistakes, including letting a Sith Lord flourish right under their noses. (Not to mention the way so many things in the way they treat Anakin actually push him toward the Emperor.) Qui-Gon was a “focus on the moment” kind of guy. Besides, he’s no more of a fuck up than the rest of the Jedi. Yoda certainly didn’t see Vader coming (beyond a “this kid seems kind of off” sort of way). And in Revenge of the Sith, they make mistake after mistake (don’t make him a member of the council despite all his accomplishments, council him on accepting loss that will come rather than trying to help him, etc.). Qui-Gon was the walking definition of hubris. In a very real sense, the Republic fell because he thought he knew better than everyone on the council and his own padawan. Luke was totally on point with his criticisms of the Jedi. Everything he said could be supported directly by events from the movies. One thing I really loved about the relationship between Luke and Rey was that, while they disagreed, they were both right, from a certain point of view. But who was Anakin? Nobody. A slave boy of questionable parentage* from an outer rim turd of a planet. The only thing special about him was that he was strong in the Force. That’s the lore, my dude. Either way, though, it was the midichlorians that made Anakin what he was. Or else Qui-Gon was either A) full of shit, or B) a complete ignoramus. Neither of which speaks well of the Jedi. Well, yes, it was midichlorians. It’s midichlorians that make every Jedi.  It’s the fan base (or at least part of it) that wants to pretend those scenes didn’t happen. Rey has a high midichlorian count; that’s canonically indisputable. But there’s nothing in the canon that says only Skywalkers have high midichlorian counts. Sure, go with that, if it makes you feel better. That just puts us back to “Shmi Skywalker doesn’t remember who the father was”. The nicest version of that is she’s just crazy. [Edited to remove a lot of unnecessary rehashing. Suffice to say, until TPM gets remade, or another film retcons them out, no, I’m not being sarcastic.] Oh. Because midichlorians, and their relationship to strong Force users, are canonical. No other path to Force abilities has ever been shown, even in the either version of the EU, pre- or post-Disney. It’s never come up again, and no one in-universe worries about it, but there it is. Ah, but another path *could* be shown, and no one has yet tested Rey’s midichlorian count and announced it through the roof (at least not that we’ve seen). That would make it canonically indisputable. Other materials have strong force channeling capabilities. Such as Kyber crystals. We’ve seen crystaline critters in the most recent film so it isn’t a stretch to imagine non-carbon based force users. Kyber crystals have never been shown to channel Force abilities in a way that negates midichlorians. Until Rogue One they were an EU concept. Even there, they appeared to act to focus Force energy, but didn’t do that on their own. For all we know the study of midichlorians is like force phrenology. Considering it’s unlikely that non-human force users could be hosting the same micro-organism. If that makes you feel better, fine. (I would go with something a little less fraught than phrenology though. But that’s just me.) But TPM continues to be a  SW movie that exists. AFAIK, even the EU left midichlorians.  And again, your limits of suspension of disbelief are your own, but just so we’re clear: the Force is fine, interplanetary biology is fine, but a related microorganism that can transcend barriers of interplanetary is too far. There’s also no reason to believe that a person’s midichlorean count is static. IIUC, they’re some sort of mico-organism force bacteria. Perhaps training and practice of the force can increase their number by providing them with a healthy environment. That would explain why the faithful, like the bomber pilot woman, can get by in a pinch. Why is it absurd? 1. Anakin’s saber had to be found somewhere and the hand was likely with it. They went down together after all. 2. The Saber called out to her. It makes sense that she’s connected to it smehow 3. She has a raw power in the force that we’ve only ever seen in Skywalkers 4. Cloning is already a huge part of the saga. 5. It was suggested that Anakin’s birth might have been similarly unnatural. I suppose it’s within the realm of possibility in this story, but I’d be disappointed if that turned out to be the case. It undermines the egalitarian themes of TLJ and puts us right back in the Chosen One/”everyone important is related to each other” rut that I think Star Wars should be getting away from. It’s absurd because it would be impossibly coincidental that Rey just happened to get caught up in the doings of her clone-father. Just like it was hugely coincidental that Luke managed to stumble across a droid his own father built, and get caught up in *his* doings. Just how small is this galaxy, anyway? So, what you’re saying is that it’s exactly in line with how these movies have worked in the past, never mind the will of the force. I don’t think it was necessary, as Han and Leia seemed pretty settled to me by that point.  The real reason was because Yoda said that “there is another” in Empire, and they needed to justify that line.  Originally it was going to be a sequel hook for a future trilogy, but when Lucas decided he didn’t want to do that, they decided to make the only woman in the story be Luke’s sister. I loved every minute of it, but some of it didn’t work, like for instance some of the stuff on the casino planet. Really like the direction they went with Rey, though outrage about it will be over 9000 on the internetz. I loved both Luke and Kylo’s character arcs. Rose was great as well, and the porgs weren’t overdone.
What was your problem with Poe’s subplot and what was the weird Force moment? Was it Rey lifting the rocks or Luke’s force ghost? I thought the weird Force moment was most likely Leia surviving in space and flying back to the ship.  While I admit that scene sounds ridiculous (particularly typing it out), I cheered when it happened.  I’ve been waiting forever for Leia to have a big display of power.  After all, Darth Vader made it sound like if Luke didn’t join the dark side, his sister was a great candidate.  Also, the “flying in space” moment makes me think: Here is a woman who is super-powerful with the force, and rather than training to become a Jedi, she decided to become a general and lead her people. That’s pretty friggin’ awesome. It is awesome. I haven’t read the new novels set between the two trilogies, but they’re supposed to be canon – Leia, who’d been organizing the rebellion since she was 14, a Senator at 19 etc, was busy after the war with politics and stuff. Apparently she ran for Chancellor (sort of President of the Galaxy) at one point, but her emails – wait, no that’s something else. People found out she was Vader’s daughter and not Bail Organa’s and she lost support and had to drop out of the race. But she never had time to study the Force, what with a political career and parenthood, which doesn’t mean she didn’t pick up a few tricks. I had zero problem with the scene. She was force pulling herself to the ship..I thought that was the deal anyway. If one can use the force to pull or push objects why not yourself? Especially in space. The weird Force moment is Leia’s survival being blown out in to space and her subsequent return to the ship. The same idea (suddenly, when threatened with death, she finds Force powers she didn’t know she had) could have been accomplished with, say, suddenly throwing up a Force shield/bubble/whatever that protects her (and then she could lapse into unconsciousness from the strain for whatever length of time the plot needed). My thing with Poe is this: He should, at a minimum, be in the brig at the end of the movie, or dead from a bullet in the head, executed. He committed mutiny. He pulled a weapon on his commanding officer. You don’t excuse that with, “Well, he’s cute, isn’t he?” and a wink. Maybe he gets thrown in the brig and then when the Resistance is so depleted he gets a reluctant parole, or something. But what happens to him is waaaaaay too minimizing of the severity of his crime. Flying snowmen are weird.

My only issue with that scene was

it was cruel. Carrie’s gone and she’s not going to twitch her fingers and open her eyes and literally fly back to us. Her death, and how the movies are going to handle that, looms heavily over this movie. I wish Johnson had either killed Leia, or left her alone. Yeah, but that was all shot before Fisher died. Huge swaths of the film would have had to be reworked to accommodate her death. I don’t think it would have been possible, timewise. I mean, it wouldn’t have prohibitive to reconstruct the scene so that she’s only knocked unconscious in an explosion. What’s shown in the movie toys with my emotions in an unfair way. Mostly agree about Poe. I assume they would have thrown him in the brig, if they still had one. As the Resistance military no longer exists, there’s no longer a chain of command or appropriate authority to discipline him, and the Falcon doesn’t have cells. Ironically, though, after the third time I saw the movie (yes I like it that much) i realized that, without Poe’s insubordination at the beginning of the film, everyone would be dead. Since the FO can track them through hyperspace, had they called off the attack when ordered to, the dreadnought would have followed them, and blown them up after the jump. So he was right, taking out the “fleet killer” ship was necessary (although nobody knew that at the time). At the same time, virtually everything else he did in the movie was wrong. As another reviewer put it, he’s like a hammer who just sees nails everywhere. People blame Holdo for not “fail[ing] to communicate well” [https://www.wired.com/story/star-wars-last-jedi-the-resistance-tactical-mistake] but the plan required operational security. Look what happens when Poe finds out about the transports – he blabs about them on the radio, and DJ overhears and tells Phasma. It’s a secret plan that relies on stealth and sneakiness, dude. That’s why she’s not telling you what it is. Loose lips sink ships. Go eat something and take a nap so you’ll be ready when they need a pilot. No. No no no. All it would have done, by your own argument, is move up something (the hyperspace tracking) that was inevitable anyway. And Poe had no damn idea about that anyway. His actions are not justifiable. You don’t get to disobey an order merely because you disagree with the officer giving it. And this is how “heroics” like Poe’s at the beginning of the film are continually justified in movies like this one. “Well, he saved the day, so it’s fine that he’s a rogue asshole who doesn’t respect his superiors.” And how the film ultimately handles Poe is a perfect smack at that. I understand where you’re coming from BUT…The Resistance is not the same thing as The Army of the New Republic. They’re honestly more like a Hezbollah or Al Qaeda or Afghani Warlords type group. Not only do things work differently but they can’t afford to lose him as weak as they are. They can certainly afford to discipline him, instead of just shrugging. Jesus, even ragtag organizations need to trust that people are not going be pulling guns on other members. You cannot operate like that. Poe has proven that he is not to be trusted. Behavior like Poe’s makes them even weaker and even more in danger of completely collapsing. “suddenly throwing up a Force shield/bubble/whatever that protects her (and then she could lapse into unconsciousness from the strain for whatever length of time the plot needed).” Luke talks about the Force and the Jedi being parts of a religion. That also applies to many fan(atic)s and their relationship to these films. The critics who are rating this highly see many, many crappy movies for every good one like this. For all those who are dumping on the film I say buy some action figures and make your own movie with your iphone.  There, isn’t that better?
The Wolf, man. I agree with a lot of what you said, but your argument is a little too close to N1 (2015 Bingo card) for my taste. I’ve been told about this movie second-hand, but it’s my understanding that another iconic character (one of the most important in cinema history) gets unceremoniously dispatched, just like in the last film. I think I’m going to take a hard pass on this. I don’t need to see beloved characters picked off to make way for the new, blander toyline like it’s the 1980s Transformers movie. This will be a hard pass for me. Spoiler: If you’re talking about Luke Skywalker, he doesn’t get “unceremoniously dispatched.” He gets a proper arc with a proper ending to his journey, which he completes on his own terms. I couldn’t ask for a more meaningful exploration and celebration of what Luke Skywalker means to this saga. And Mark Hamill has never played him better. You’ll always have the old movies, with the old characters you loved. Part of the point of this new trilogy, and this film in particular, is to wean us away from familiar characters and plotlines and comfortable expectations, to make room for genuinely new stories and fresh adventures. Rey, Poe, Finn, and now Rose don’t feel like a bland new toyline to me — they’re much-needed additions that make the Star Wars universe feel more inclusive, with room for regular people who aren’t Chosen Ones to make a real difference. Some folks won’t want to take this journey, and that’s fine. For me, I’m excited about how this movie has shaken things up and look forward to what comes next. I was talking about them as characters, and as what they represent in the story. I don’t think any fair military justice system would treat them as culpable as Poe in what they do. First, my own review:
I will try to be as non-spoilery as possible even though there are parts that I REALLY want to talk about.
This movie is different. It feels strange compared to previous, predictable, Star Wars movies.
Its very much an in between movie. Its the middle of the story, and it can be frustrating.
Many  things do not go the way any of us would have thought, and I know lots
of fans will not like that. Heck, there are parts that I am not happy
with, but overall it is fun, and really helps with characterization
leading into part 3.
The movie looks great, of course. Acting is great all around, with Adam Driver doing a good job playing the anguished Kylo Ren.
I know its an odd thing to say, but I sometimes get distracted by how
gorgeous Daisy Ridley is. Rey is too hot. It kind of takes me out of the
 movie. Yes, it’s a weird personal issue.
It’s nice to see Mark Hamil back as Luke, although I had some issues with his arc. This will have to be discussed elsewhere.
Rose is an interesting new character, but her story is a bit strange. Plus,
the casino sequence reminded me of the prequels, and that’s not a
positive.
I think part 3 will really tell us a bit better what the actual point of part 2 was. At least I hope it does.
Otherwise its just a glorified chase movie that only adds minor things
to the bigger story going on. It’s saved by some great action sequences
and some good character development.
I could say so much more! I’ll have to delve into spoilers elsewhere. I know its an odd thing to say, but I sometimes get distracted by how
gorgeous Daisy Ridley is. Rey is too hot. It kind of takes me out of the
movie. Yes, it’s a weird personal issue. I was pleased that so many of the new characters in the movie didn’t look like glamorous movie stars. I don’t necessarily object to looking at pretty people, but it’s more democratic—and more thematically appropriate—when anyone can be a hero. I was pleased, too, which is my point. She really stands out. Not to say anyone else is ugly, just that, for me, she’s stunning.
I loved Princess Mononoke. Good reference! That’s your problem. Rey is not glamorized by the films, and she is not sexualized. She is treated as a real human woman. If you can’t see past how physically attractive you find her, that only says something about you. Sorry, I’ve been busy at work and couldn’t respond.
Of course I got past it. But there were a lot of closeups of her face, I noticed. She had makeup on, which I found a little strange, but who knows?
For Rose, I just meant the casino setup and scene. And her last scene with Finn. I’m pretty sure that Rey is not wearing any obvious makeup (and even whatever needed-for-filming makeup is very subtle). It’s one of the things that constantly struck me about Rey, that we seem to see seeing her natural, un-made-up face. Augh!! I was in the middle of commenting, accidentally hit some button, and the whole thing disappeared. Damn!
Again…
Spoilers! I can’t figure out how to hide them.

. Reys parentage: Still in question? Did Kylo lie to her? I was thinking she might have been his brother or something. Part 3 will reveal more, I hope. I understand Lukes arc, but I don’t much like it. I was hoping for a final epic lightsaber battle or something. Maybe him and Rey fighting side by side.
I was also expecting(hoping for?) more of Rey becoming a Jedi. Training, The Force, etc. Maybe next movie? Rose falling in love with Finn within a matter of hours was a bit weird. Superfan weird. I liked her otherwise, but still didn’t like the casino sequence. Ugh. We seem to left with a First Order lacking in any real powerful scary villain. Kylo is great as a angsty troubled guy conflicted in many ways, but he makes for kind of a weak enemy and leader. General Hux is basically the butt of jokes now.  They didn’t really end Leia’s arc at all did they? It feels like she was intended to be part of the next one, so I’m not sure how they’ll work that out.  He did. And it ended pretty much exactly the way these battles end in Star Wars. If anything, Luke’s victory is much less ambiguous than Obi-Wan’s or Yoda’s. Meanwhile, Rey got just as much training as Luke did. More honest too. Reys parentage: Still in question? Did Kylo lie to her? I was thinking she might have been his brother or something. Part 3 will reveal more, I hope. I’m hoping he DIDN’T lie to her. This seems to be supported by her experience in the underground cavern, where she tries to find out who her parents are but the only person the “magic mirror” shows her is herself. Star Wars needs to get away from “you’re magic because your parents are magic,” and I like the idea that the Force is potentially accessibly by everyone. In fact, Rey said so herself (or was it Luke who told her?), during one of her training sessions: she could feel that the energy field was part of the world and part of everything, and didn’t belong exclusively to the Jedi. That was also the point of the little kid at the end who Force-pulled the broom to himself: ANYBODY can do this, and you don’t need magic Skywalker blood to make a difference. *shrug* Who the hell was Palpatine and where did HE come from? There’s always some generic evil dude trying to take over the galaxy. I’m glad he got knocked off, so we don’t have to get Palpatine redux and we can have Kylo Ren as the main villain instead, who’s much more interesting. She WAS already a Finn superfan before she personally met him, though. And Luke fell in love with Leia, what, the moment he saw her hologram? We seem to left with a First Order lacking in any real powerful scary villain. Kylo is great as a angsty troubled guy conflicted in many ways, but he makes for kind of a weak enemy and leader. General Hux is basically the butt of jokes now. I think it’s a very interesting direction to take. This film is all about shaking off old expectations, and one of them seems to be the need for some kind of supercompetent ultra-bad guy. Having Hux and Ren be a comedic duo is something this series hasn’t previously explored, so I find it refreshing. And as has been pointed out, having a villain who turns out to be a petulant, impulsive man-child feels pretty plausible and relevant these days. They didn’t really end Leia’s arc at all did they? It feels like she was intended to be part of the next one, so I’m not sure how they’ll work that out. I feel like they did. A character’s arc doesn’t have to end in death, and I feel like the whole point of Leia in this film was to (1) show leadership, (2) teach leadership, and (3) pass the leadership role to the next generation, which I think she effectively did. I know they intended to do more with her in the next film — and I would have dearly loved to see more from Carrie Fisher — but I think this works as a satisfying ending to her role as well. The next movie can always jump a bit ahead in time and show Leia’s funeral, after she’s died of natural causes or something. – Spoilers- Thinking about Leia’s (and Luke’s) arc reminds me of something that’s been pointed out on YouTube (specifically the folks at Hyper RPG, whose spoiler reviews I enjoy): folks are talking more about what happens in THIS movie rather than what this movie SETS UP for the next film. When you think about it, it’s pretty much a complete movie, and everything, really, has been resolved: Snoke is gone and Kylo Ren is the new baddie; Rey’s the new Jedi hope, and her parents are irrelevant; the original trio have all effectively come to the end of their arcs; there’s a big bad Imperial entity trying to take over the galaxy and snuff out a rebellion, and ’twas ever thus. So it feels like ANYTHING could happen at this point, and the next film isn’t obligated to tie up any loose ends or resolve old mysteries. Which I find really exciting. If we’re in for an era of fresh Star Wars stories (well, minus the Han Solo prequel) that actually FEEL LIKE the original trilogy did, taking us in new directions rather than getting bogged down in nostalgia and decades of fan expectations, then bring it on. I would compare Snoke to Darth Sidious. We know Sidious was Palpatine, the senator. Who was Snoke before he became what he is now? I don’t NEED to know. I’m just curious. We obviously didn’t know who the emperor was until the prequels came out. Although he was a better character in the OT than Snoke is/was in this trilogy. I was wondering about the kid. I didn’t see him use any kind of force to get the broom. I just thought his ring showed support for the rebellion.  Personally, I don’t like the idea that anyone can use the force, or anyone could be a Jedi. Although, I assume this means that anyone can be born with it. Not that anyone on the planet, at any time, could bust out the force if they had the will to do it. FOR ME, that would seriously dampen the specialness of Jedis and the force.  Yes, anyone can be a hero, or do heroic things, but to be a Jedi is something different entirely. Not necessarily better, just different. Like being a wizard instead of a knight in an rpg. It would be awful boring if everyone could be everything.  I didn’t want Leia to die. Just a more buttoned up end. It was almost there, but then in the end it seemed open. No matter. It’s all good.
I find Kylo fascinating as a character, and Adam Driver is great. He just doesn’t exude the power and menace that a great villain should, IMHO. Maybe when IX comes around time will have gone by and he’ll no longer be in flux. They kind of resolved that in this one, didn’t they? He’s not coming back. For me they’re about the same. Menacing voice, facial disfigurement, generic Dark Lord masterminding and “everything is going according to my plan,” etc. The “red chamber” scene deliberately mirrors Luke’s confrontation with Vader and the Emperor in the throne room, and what happens to Snoke deliberately subverts our expectations. Fair enough, but it’s pretty clear the movie WANTS to take the Jedi down a couple of pegs and democratize the Force. Not necessarily that everyone can automatically use it, but that everyone potentially CAN, if they have the aptitude or perhaps work hard at it. That’s what I took away from Rey’s training session (“The Force doesn’t just belong to the Jedi”) and the anonymous kid’s subtle Force-use at the end. And maybe it even goes back to the previous film (it’s in the title!) and Snoke mentioning that “there has been an awakening in the Force.” Maybe it means that more people are awakening TO the Force. I don’t think it takes away from the Force’s “specialness” to have more people have access to it, any more than it makes singing (or cooking or gardening or political leadership) less special if more people acquire those abilities and do those things well, regardless of their bloodlines and ancestry. Yeah, I think you’re right, he’s decided to be evil now. Maybe still complicated and conflicted, but definitely a bad guy. Which I think is the right direction for the story. We’ve already had SIX MOVIES about the corruption-and-redemption arc of a bad guy. Time to do something else. It’s been a long, and unfortunate, tradition that most of the secondary Sith are really, really boring. (YMMV.) Fortunately, this series appears to be getting rid of them really, really quickly. It does make me sad that one of the boring villains was played by Gwendoline Christie. If you can’t find one interesting thing for Gwendoline Christie to do, you’re not trying very hard. “I don’t think it takes away from the Force’s “specialness” to have more
people have access to it, any more than it makes singing (or cooking or
gardening or political leadership) less special if more people acquire
those abilities and do those things well, regardless of their bloodlines
 and ancestry.” Access is good. But there will always be people who kick ass at things better then others. Humbly, I am a very knowledgeable landscaper and gardener . It is what I do, and I do it well. If everyone one on the planet had the same skills as me my talents would no longer be special. Thing is, we all know that everyone has the drive or will to do that. I’m sure it would be the same with any other talent, as well as something like the force. So I’m cool with any random person being born with the capability. Most will never reach higher tier of force talent, though, I imagine. No one is disputing that. But TLJ’s point is that the Force is for everyone, as opposed to being the exclusive property of the Jedi. I’ve just seen the film again, and Luke clearly tells Rey: “The Force does not belong to the Jedi. To say the Jedi dies, the Force dies is vanity.” You’re a good gardener because you put your mind and heart into it, and you’ve worked at it all your life. Not because you have “gardener blood” or come from a long line of master gardeners or were admitted into a high priesthood of gardeners. The movie is making the same point about the Force. I mean, that could be the basis for a great comedy, if Disney wanted to make other sorts of SW movies. But I don’t think that’s going to happen. That might be a fascinating character. I can imagine, just for example, someone who’s strong in the Force but is so disgusted by the violence and corruption on both sides that she refuses to be part of the bloodshed, until the moment when she has no choice. I’m honestly a bit confused by this comment. Ive heard his name, of course, but don’t know what he did. I’ll have to look it up. That’s what I was getting at with my comment about the Force’s Reformation. It’s like when Christianity went from an arcane knowledge held by secretive priests that ordinary people could not participate in (partly by the Bible not being available in everyday languages, and mass spoken only in Latin) to something that anyone could read about and analyze and think about for themselves. Or, war and grief amps up people’s emotions. And you can be attracted to someone and what they represent without being “in love” with them. Did she? I thought she just kissed him and passed out, after her great line: “That’s how we’re going to win. Not fighting what we hate. Saving what we love.” Rose being in love with Finn: There are fifty thousand movies in which men fall in love with women the second they see them (at first sight) and nearly all of those movies treat that as completely normal, even though it’s bizarre and scary. Here
is one movie in which a woman who is established in her first
scene as already being a big fan of Finn and she makes an
indirect declaration of love at the ending after they’ve already been through some emotionally intense experiences together, and people are saying it’s ridiculous, no one falls in love that fast, Rose is stupid, she’s a weak love interest character. Umm…what? Yup, this. In fact, I remember seeing a science fiction movie where a farmboy fell in love with a beautiful princess the moment he laid eyes on her hologram. Well, I think it’s ALL ridiculous. Instant love is BS. You can infatuation, like Rose, that can turn into something else over time. Or even lust and desire. Real love takes time. IMHO, of course.
Hollywood likes to truncate everything, and I get that. It *is* ridiculous. But it’s definitely a real thing that people — especially young people — sometimes think is a thing. I would imagine that likeliness of feeling that feeling is heightened during intense situations, like war. Seriously though, there’s a huge stable of amazing actresses in the 55-65 age range, any number of whom could carry the role through one movie. I know they won’t do this, but my dream casting is Meryl Streep, since didn’t she basically play Carrie Fisher in “Postcards from the Edge?” They probably won’t recast, and I hope they don’t. I know recasting has been successfully done on movies and franchises, but it feels wrong for this. Carrie Fisher is Leia. Recasting the role for Episode IX would be like recasting Tony Stark in between Avengers 3 and 4 — it would take a LOT of heavy lifting to make it okay with the public. I don’t see how they can recast Leia. I don’t think it would work. They’re going to have to find a way to tell the next story without a significant presence from Leia. I think that shouldn’t be too hard. In the original trilogy, a significant amount of in-story time passes between the films. There’s no reason they can’t do that now; there aren’t any cliffhangers that need to be immediately resolved, beyond the usual “powerful bad guys are chasing after underdog rebels” situation. The story could easily open after a few years have passed, perhaps starting with a very respectful funeral for General Organa. It even sets up and continues a powerful theme from TLJ: how do you become the hero, after your heroes are gone? I wonder if J.J. Abrams will make her death a key plot point, like the destruction of Vulcan in Star Trek, so that Leia becomes a significant presence by not being present. I understand Lukes arc, but I don’t much like it. I was hoping for a final epic lightsaber battle or something.

I think both Abrams and Johnson have felt constrained by the character arc that Luke went through in the original trilogy. ROTJ ends with Luke throwing down his lightsaber and refusing to kill his father. He finally understands what Yoda has been trying to tell him, “Wars not make one great” etc. He tries to fight, he loses. When he refuses to fight, he wins. Having him fight again would undermine his previously established spiritual growth. As it is, they followed through perfectly. The one time he raises a sword out of fear, the consequences are terrible. He finds away to aid the Resistance without killing anyone. He obviously still cares about his nephew, there’s real affection in “See you around, kid.” Then he achieves enlightenment and becomes one with the Force. It was the right choice.
Having Luke fight battles again would undermine ESB and ROTJ. Saw it yesterday.  Liked it then, and the more I think about it, the more I kinda loved it.  Some parts seemed a little wonky at first, but the ideas that are the engine of the film bring it over the finish line for me. I’m the opposite. The more I pondered it, the more it fell apart. At least parts of it.
I still like the movie. I just don’t love it. I liked the general arc of the story, but I felt it was rather messy and Rey’s backstory deserved a better sendoff. And not just the casino planet subplot, but things like  Luke casually tossing away the lightsaber after Rey gives it to him and him milking the alien cow, WTF was that? I don’t know if Kathleen Kennedy as reluctant to give constructive notes on Rian Johnson’s script, but it seemed like she didn’t. The Last Jedi would’ve gone over better if it were 10-20 minutes shorter and got rid of some of the sillier aspects. New characters were pretty good (especially Kelly Marie Tran and Laura Dern), and I liked that they gave Poe more screentime. But I miss Maz Kanata, she just had one scene here and that was IT. That bummed me out. Still loved the moment. It was kind of weird and a little gross, and not implausible behavior for someone who chose to live as a hermit on an inaccessible planet. We have no idea if Poe will be redeemed in a traditional storytelling sense, or in any sense. Given the unusual thematic twists this movie took, it wouldn’t be surprising if he didn’t. Okay….I generally enjoyed the movie, but I had a nagging dissatisfied feeling at the end and it took a couple days to think it through.  1)The entire middle of the movie is one giant Macguffin.  We merrily chase a “code breaker” for an awful lot of the movie and none of it matters at all in any way….  2)…and it should never have happened because there is no actual narrative reason to have had an 18 hour chase and ships running of fuel etc.  This is a plot contrivance that we will discuss later.  Even if you want a chase, the director
apparently never watched Master and Commander and could not think of how
 to make an exciting chase, so he had to get major characters off the cruiser and doing something utterly useless somewhere else. Oh that brings us to….  4)  Admiral Holdo is never allowed to be a character.  She is a plot device for Poe and part of the 18 hour chase contrivance. She has few lines, and few scenes.  She issues orders, but inexplicably never communicates her plan or goals.  This allows Poe to keep doing what Poe does, which is screw things up and send people (Finn and Rose) on a hare brained scheme that accomplishes…nothing (except tipping off the First Order that Resistance shuttles were leaving the Mon Calimari cruiser).  Finally, Poe commits mutiny and tries to take over what is
left of the Resistance.  Fortunately, General Organa awakens and stuns
Poe.  Leia is suddenly doing things as normal and there is no consequence (!!!!) aside from…Admiral Holdo sacrifices herself by ramming the First Order command battleship…essentially ‘fridging’* herself so that Poe can grow and mature.  There was never any need to knock out Leia for half the movie….the director wanted her out of the way to introduce Laura Dern as a motivational tool for the hero guy.
The only thing missing was her red shirt and the obligatory “She’s dead,
 Jim.”  She deserved better.  So did the rest of us.  5) So if we didn’t really need an extended chase scenario that prompted a need to get major characters off the ship and doing something utterly useless at a casino planet and Leia is unconscious for no particular reason for half the movie (as discussed above) then what in the world is the point of a lot of this?    Oh yeah…Poe finally gets to grow up and try to call off a suicidal run on the Guns of Navarone in the third act!  See?  He CAN be taught!   So to make that happen:  1. Admiral Ackbar gets spaced   2. Leia gets spaced but goes all Mary Poppins and saves herself to sickbay for half the movie  3. Admiral Holdo blows herself up  4. Finn and Rose accomplish nothing except nearly being executed by decapitation (and tipping off the First Order that shuttles were trying to leave the Mon Calimari cruser). 1)The entire middle of the movie is one giant Macguffin. We merrily chase a “code breaker” for an awful lot of the movie and none of it matters at all in any way…. But it does matter. It sets up what the First Order believes will be the ultimate destruction of the Resistance. It sets up the flowering of hope among the downtrodden of the galaxy. It brings in a whole new thematic motif about the economic disparity in the galaxy. It’s vitally important in showing how old-fashioned cliched heroics are a really bad, really dumb idea. Wow. No. You cannot “fridge” yourself. The whole point of that criticism is that is removes a character’s agency. Holdo is NOTHING BUT agency. And we have no idea whether Poe will grow or mature or change. (I suspect he won’t, precisely because he suffered no great personal consequences for his behavior. Maybe he will feel guilty over causing the near destruction of the Resistance, but we see no evidence of that so far.) A good leader does explain herself.  People respond better when they are not just given orders but understand why something is being done.  On the other hand, she may well have known that had she explained herself, Poe would have gone off and done whatever he wanted anyhow. This is where people with military backgrounds have very different interpretations of military movies than other viewers.  Things don’t work that way simply because you can’t afford to have your units or subordinates running around in the dark with no idea what they are trying to accomplish.  It is ineffective and will lead to mission failure and unnecessary casualties.  Holdo would absolutely have known this because she is an (by definition) experienced flag rank officer and NOT a new lieutenant.  That’s the last that I will say on that since we are not going to agree.  Sigh. Okay, I will give you all of that. (I don’t necessarily agree with it, but for the sake of argument.) Holdo withheld information to punish Poe, because she was annoyed with him. Which means Holdo is a flawed human person, and did a thing that flawed human people do. That’s not a bad thing. People fuck up. People don’t always behave in the most reasonably perfect way possible — in fact, we hardly ever do. All this means is that Holdo’s issues as well as Poe’s issues drive the plot. “It sets up what the First Order believes will be the ultimate
destruction of the Resistance. It sets up the flowering of hope among the downtrodden of the galaxy.” That is nebulous at best.  it still seems like an awful lot of the 2 hours plus movie was spent to get nowhere.  At the very least, ruthless editing was required, if not a wholesale script revision on this arc. In any event, it was a deliberate contrivance to have an experienced officer do something she never would have done in order to make other things happen, which also goes to my contention that she is never allowed to be a real character in the first place.  She is a plot device. Ackbar was no more developed a character onscreen (I have no idea how or if his character appears in novels or cartoons or whatever) than Holdo. Arguably even less so. Yes, Adm Ackbar was well know and developed in the greater Star Wars universe (books etc) and had been one of the more famous characters to come out of Return of the Jedi.  But we are now into breaking things…so there it is. Adm Holdo does none of this.  She reminds me of the young Lieutenant from The Lost Patrol with Boris Karloff and Victor McLaglen who never tells anyone what they are doing and thereby dooms the whole enterprise. As I have already said, this is deliberate contrivance on the part of the writers in order to provide her as a foil for Poe and thereby give him a reason to send underlings on strange schemes and ultimately, mutiny. Wait, you’re saying that the screenwriters created characters with conflicting beliefs in order to set the plot in motion? That’s…exactly what writers are supposed to do. Holdo is, in my opinion, a better antagonist for Poe than Ackbar would have been. And if she has to be a flawed communicator and military leader in order for the story to work, that’s a contrivance I’m willing to live with. YMMV. Bingo. Flawed characters — if you want to see Holdo as flawed — are what make for great drama. And a lack of communication skills on Holdo’s part — if that’s how you want to see it — still does not justify mutiny. In some ways, the thing I love most about the movie is that nobody knows what the fuck they’re doing. It reminds me of our world in 2017, where there are horriffic things happening everywhere, and every solution seems to make the problems a little worse. In the movie, even the most experienced veterans are making it up as they go along. Sometimes they do stupid things. Sometimes everyone seems to be right—or equally wrong. I could make an argument in favor of Finn’s suicide run—which might have wiped out the First Order leadership and one of their most powerful weapons—but as a bleeding-heart liberal, I prefer Rose’s more compassionate solution. The writers were smart enough to give every character flaws and terrible ideas, and I think the movie is stronger for it. Not even a character and not a necessary one either.  She is a device for Poe to have a conflict with.  In order to have Poe have a conflict leading to mutiny in the first place, the writers have to kill off or sideline two layers of command and control in order to introduce her in the first place. She never has a chance to actually develop as a person and she is not given any background or observable motivation.  She is a high ranking red shirt.  That’s it.  Poe already had a conflict with Leia.  That was established and it was believable.  Poe is a tactician, not a strategist and he gambles recklessly.  Leia is a big picture person and a venerable leader.  That could absolutely been developed for the drama you are seeking and the mutiny should been dropped or (if we want to actually be dark…not a bad possibility) have the possibility of him planning the mutiny against Leia and go with what that could suggest about his character.  The more I think about it, the better I like that. But nooooooo…..Leia is sidelined for no reason at  all (and I say that because her absence was specifically engineered to make room for an unnecessary “character” and had utterly no plot consequence when she woke aside from that contrived conflict) and red shirt Holdo is introduced and custom ordered to have a conflict with our lovable rogue whom we already like and identify with.  Her flaw, as you identify, is simply not credible.  Flag officers don’t do that.  If anything, they over communicate and drown you in micro management. (BTW, what ever happened to command by common assent?  The rebels were really big on that in A New Hope and again in Rogue One..  It isn’t really effective, but it was a defining part of the rebels.) This is much of why I found that particular arc of film exasperating and unfulfilling.  I would far rather the movie stayed with Luke, Rey and Kylo Ren.  Don’t Give A Damn Luke was far more interesting and Rey is always exciting and a pleasure to see. So we do it the chicksh**  ‘safe’ way by making up a cardboard cutout admiral who is never developed into a believable person instead of having Poe develop the conflict he already has with Leia…because that would force the audience to choose loyalty! Do you stay with the lovable rogue you have been getting to  know or with the beloved Princess you already know?  That would have been a far more engaging and fascinating. The premise is: The admiral appears to be making a foolish, desperate decision that could kill most of the rebels, and she’s keeping it hidden from them. If the person making that decision were Leia (or even Ackbar), people in the audience would say: “She’d never do that. There must be something else going on.” (Or they’d think she’s acting out of character and get angry at the screenwriters.) But if they introduce a new, unpredictable character, she’s capable of doing anything, and no one knows what to expect. Fortunately, The Verge has no power to make you think anything. But it has done an excellent problem of explaining why not everyone agrees with you. I must have read a different article.  Sorry, but it did nothing of the sort that I saw.  Anyways, I’ll debate another movie later.  We aren’t going to get anywhere here.  We are both in our respective trenches. [L]etting Holdo — a new character — fill that role instead of Ackbar helps solve some of Star Wars’ economy-of-character issues, where it seems like almost everyone has to be directly related to or involved with everyone else. SO MUCH THIS. This is part of why I didn’t want Rey to be lost Skywalker, or Luke’s clone, or someone with *any* connection to characters we’ve already met. Thanks, I think we need to take a break from “character spends improbably long in vacuum with little to no long term injury.” Although I kind of want a force duel in zero-g now. I hate to defend this sequence, but it’s pretty clear that Leia does suffer intermediate injury, and it’s too soon to know what sort of long-term affects she might suffer. Yeah, but that’s a bad thing. The Last Jedi isn’t a commentary on Star Wars. It’s the next episode. Just as it wouldn’t be wrong to expect a book to maintain coherent character arcs from chapter to chapter, it’s not wrong to expect Luke’s role in TLJ to build upon qualities established in previous movies, or that controversial developments will be satisfactorily justified. You gotta care about what your audience thinks, even if you don’t plan on giving them what they wanted, because you need to persuade them what you’re giving them instead is better. (And this applies to other characters too, like Poe or Rey.) As for the movie itself, I’m happy other people enjoyed TLJ. I liked some parts of it & hope that the conclusion to the sequels will retroactively solve some of my other issues with it. But I’m not persuaded this movie innovated for the better overall– or even that it was unusually innovative for Star Wars.  Luke repeating the sins of the old Jedi, right down to becoming a cranky hermit who dissipates after a dramatic show down with his former apprentice, leaving a young and barely trained Force-user to rebuild the Jedi her own way certainly feels like Johnson just combined Yoda and Obi-Wan’s plots. Wrt Poe’s plot, it’s a retread of rash heroism blowing up in Luke’s face at the end of The Empire Strikes Back and also undermined by the fact that he’ll be in Episode 9, which probably won’t end with the bad guys winning. And if this movie genuinely cares about building up new non-Skywalker drama Star Wars stories, shouldn’t the Canto Blight scenes be better?  Speaking of which, there are parts which are simply not executed well. (Ex jokes undercutting dramatic tension too much, Benicio del Toro’s character,  Holdo’s Necessary and Heroic sacrifice being followed by Rose preventing Finn from sacrificing himself in a similar fashion on the grounds that self-sacrifice is now Bad and Unnecessary, that twee bit with the broom, TLJ undermining it’s own subversion of the Obi-Wan vs Vader duel from ANH by having it kill Luke anyway, and of course Canto Blight giving major prequel vibes.) And as your review points out, it doesn’t really stand on it’s own or make for a good introduction to the series.  Anyway, it’s really weird to talk about TLJ right now because I feel more strongly about the critical frames used to discuss the movie than I felt about the actual movie. It’s odd that reviews of these sort of serialized blockbusters aren’t more like TV reviews, in the sense that continuity and narrative cohesion isn’t valued more. Pardon, I meant it isn’t *just* a commentary. Of course stories can work on multiple levels. Previous Star Wars movies did this too, which is why there’s room for fans to disagree over whether TLJ built off of the previous movies in satisfactory or believable manner. Praising Johnson for not giving a whit about alienating some fans assumes that those fans didn’t have any good ideas or valid critiques to make of the media franchise that they’re obsessed with. Treating “disappointed Star Wars fan” as synonymous with “entitled white fanboy who hates change” presumes bad faith. It’s a strawman argument.  And I get why people worry about fan entitlement complexes, but I’m also sick to death of being conflated with dudes who wish the sequels starred a knock-off of their preferred EU Gary Stu just because I think TLJ was unsatisfying, shafted Finn and was responding more to do with what straight white men think the original trilogy was about than to what was actually in the original trilogy. They are not always synonymous, but often they are. Entitled fanboys are not only extremely vocal in their disapproval but extremely demanding that the things the love conform to some very narrow strictures. Critics question storytelling decisions in original movies all the time, without it being seen as an attempt to wrest authorial control away from the filmmakers. Besides, fans of the previous Star Wars movies literally are the authors of this story: Johnson, Abrams, Edwards, and (I’m sure) many others at Disney are Star Wars fans. Their work on Star Wars is shaped by their perspectives as fans, not simply as filmmakers.  I can tell that the intention behind it doesn’t apply to fangirls like me. But in my experience, when “fan” and “entitled fanboy” are used interchangeably, what happens is that the fanboys get centered in the discussions that follow– even if it’s just as the antagonists. Critics question storytelling decisions in original movies all the time, without it being seen as an attempt to wrest authorial control away from the filmmakers. I think your review of the latest Transformers was better for referring to it as “Michael Bay’s Public Masturbation” than a review which took an unemotional tack. So I think the same rules apply to people who aren’t professional critics as well. Certainly I don’t think every Star Wars fan in their feels about TLJ is making a critique that deserves consideration; (and with abusive fans it doesn’t matter if they made a good critique because no critique justifies harassment or any other form of abusive behavior); but I think some of the more major complaints (such as those about Luke’s characterization) have merit, especially since many of them are coming from people who liked TFA and Rogue One, and presumably wanted to like TLJ as well. Doesn’t the hyper-ram sort of break Empire tactics a bit? Why bother with capitol ships when you can strap a hyperdrive to an asteroid and turn one to gas? That’s my biggest problem with the movie. It was a poignant, beautiful scene. But it breaks suspension of disbelief. Yeah yeah, even in a franchise about space ninjas with laser swords.  As a kid I always wondered why they didn’t attach rockets to lightsabers to create missiles that could cut through anything. As a teen, when I learned about e=mc2, I wondered why they didn’t attach hyperdrives to asteroids and shatter planets. SW has sophisticated droids; why doesn’t every army have droid FTL kamikazis? Or, heck, simple hyperdrive cruise missiles? Of course, as a super fan I managed to rationalize an answer: long, long ago the SW galaxy DID have FTL weaponry. And it was so profoundly destructive, that an unbreakable social more formed against it. Like nukes in our world. Test them, possess them, but you’d have to be insane to actually use them. Yes, just like haw navel conflicts in the modern world are solved by ramming ships into each other. And how all military aircraft are used to fly directly into the enemy. I would never argue that ramming was never a thing. That would be as silly as it is ahistorical. But the tactic has never rendered all other forms of combat irrelevant, as has been explicitly suggested by some, and strongly implied by you. Alright, maybe it has to do with the mass of the object. No one’s building a torpedo the size of an aircraftcarrier… They just better not strap a warp-engine to an asteroid to destroy the Starkiller II in episode 9 or I will be very cross. SPOILER:  TLJ is a SJW pile of crap film that is a rude slap to the face on every die hard true fan of SW.  It is time we BOYCOTT! Of course, Solo is the story of manly white dude, his manly white dude mentor, their manly white dude nemesis, and a hot chick in low cut tops. The black dude is mostly comic relief, the black chick and wise cracking alien get offed in the first half hour, and even the uppity droid buys it and becomes the Falcon’s navi-computer. Sincere question: Why do you keep altering the title of the movie? Is it a pun, or a reference I’m not getting? You’ve done it in several different comments, so I assume it’s intentional. Pete here fancies is little self some sort of red-pilled alpha male, and as such disdains all things involving soy. That someone pointed out to him (cause reading is hard, yo) that you can swap a “y” for an “l” is to Petey the fucking height of hilarity. These manbabies think “soy” is an insult: like, they love the term “soyboys,” which they use to decry what they perceive as a feminization of men. You mean, you made a “meh” heist movie starring a lot of dudes tank so hard that Ocean’s 8 easily knocked it out of first place, so a fun heist movie starring eight women is now the number 1 movie in America? I have no problems with the new direction of the film. But it was way too long. And the whole casino thing is absolutely ridiculous. Champagne on Star Wars? Why not? There are plenty of alcoholic beverages in the Star Wars universe. No reason why the elite can’t be seen in a gambling establishment, drinking the Star Wars analog for champagne (or even champagne itself). One blatantly MRA Star Wars fan who asserted all the men are cowards and idiots asked how all you feminists and SJW’s would feel if the sexes in The Last Jedi were reversed. Yeah, what about that? Would you still like it then, huh? And I thought about it, and that would be bloody fantastic. Because that would mean the film would have a majority of female characters, who are not defined by their gender, and most of the scenes would have women talking to each other.  Luke, Finn, Poe, Snoke, Keylo Ren, Hux, the Codebreaker – all women? Hell yeah! I don’t think you’ve thought this one through, mate. That would be brilliant. The final stand-off between Luke and Kylo Ren but with two women? Yes please. Snoke toying with Hux and putting down Keylo Ren, but they’re all women? That’s the stuff my dreams are made of. Hotshot Poe Dameron being the best pilot in the galaxy, but she’s a woman? Keep it coming. The codebreaker being a shifty scoundrel, a detached mercenary willing to sell out anyone for a buck, but it’s a woman? Once again, that’s a step forward. Let’s just keep going: reverse Luke and Leia’s roles. Leia Skywalker is the most powerful jedi who ever lived, a legend who is also a complex, flawed figure with intense roiling emotions and uncertainties, whose final act is a monumental expression of self-sacrifice to save the ones she loves, stories of which spread and inspire hope throughout the galaxy. Again, that’s exactly what I want. Because the men in this movie are brilliantly written and conceived and are complex, interesting people. So are the women, but there’s still more focus on the men here. The most revealing thing about swapping the sexes will of course be that all the blatantly sexist comments about Rey being a too-powerful super competent Mary Sue will instantly disappear. In fact, if Rey was a boy who did everything exactly the same as Rey played by Daisy Ridley, not only will there obviously be no Mary Sue rubbish, the same ‘she’s too powerful!’ toolbags would complain that HE was too weak. ‘He should have been better, because my self-insert fantasy character, who has to be a white male, isn’t powerful enough’. You know that’s what would happen. I’ve no doubt at all that if Rey was a boy, the complaints would shift in the other direction. Especially if Keylo Ren was a woman. Then there’d be endless whining about how Girl Ren was too powerful and Boy Rey should have been able to wipe the floor with her. That’s how this works. It’s the most transparently sexist bullshit imaginable. Let’s start the revolution in North Korea♪ o(＾▽＾)○ Oh～!

"Dec 18, 2017",POSITIVE," No sÃ© quiÃ©n podrÃ­a entrar a ver una pelÃ­cula de âStar Warsâ a estas alturas sin ser fan. Si ese es el caso, disfrutarÃ¡n de una entretenida aventura en el espacio y listo. Pero la creciente tensiÃ³n, la enorme emociÃ³n, ese escalofrÃ­o que recorre nuestra espalda al escuchar el clÃ¡sico tema de John Williams y ver las letras amarillas recorrer el cielo estrellado, esa emociÃ³n incomparable ya es parte de esta franquicia. Esa âfuerzaâ, llamÃ©mosle asÃ­ sin ningÃºn propÃ³sito en particular, quizÃ¡ nos llega a cegar ante ciertas cosas o a tener unas expectativas demasiado desproporcionadas. La oscuridad crece y la luz para alcanzarla, ya saben. Hay que tener cuidado con esa fuerza, no queremos que nos ocurra lo que le pasÃ³ a Ben Solo. AsÃ­ pues, tratando de ser lo mÃ¡s objetivo posible, dirÃ© que esta cinta es muy emocionante, divertida y estÃ¡ repleta de giros inesperados. âLos Ãltimos Jediâ nos ubica casi justo donde nos dejÃ³ la anterior. Rey (Daisy Ridley) llega con Luke (Mark Hamill) y le entrega su sable lÃ¡ser, ese que su propio padre le arrancÃ³ con todo y mano aÃ±os atrÃ¡s. Mientras tanto, la Resistencia es perseguida por una despiadada Primera Orden, que parece que los tiene acorralados. Es difÃ­cil contar de quÃ© se trata la historia sin hacer observaciones que revelen algo demasiado importante de la trama pues, como ya dije, una de sus mÃ¡s llamativas caracterÃ­sticas es que estÃ¡ repleta de vueltas de tuerca. Digamos, pues, que los antes mencionados son los dos grandes puntos de la trama, pero hay un tercero. Finn (John Boyega) se encuentra a un nuevo personaje, Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), junto a quien deberÃ¡ ir en una misiÃ³n para ayudar a sus compaÃ±eros del inminente peligro que corren de ser aniquilados para siempre. âEl Imperio Contraatacaâ (1980) sigue siendo la mejor pelÃ­cula de âStar Warsâ. No creo, ni siquiera, que âLos Ãltimos Jediâ sea el equivalente de aquella cinta para esta nueva trilogÃ­a. Eso sÃ­, es muy buena. Creo que lo mÃ¡s sÃ³lido que le otorga el nuevo director, Rian Johnson, es jugar con las expectativas y darle a la trama varios momentos Ãºnicos y completamente impredecibles. Las sorpresas son mayÃºsculas e importantes para la trama central. Estos momentos son precedidos por una creciente tensiÃ³n, que la cinta tambiÃ©n maneja muy bien. La trama logra ponernos en una situaciÃ³n en la que nos tiene mordiÃ©ndonos las uÃ±as, sobre todo rumbo al final. Es decir, logra lo que ya uno no esperarÃ­a de este tipo de cintas, que creamos que cualquier cosa puede ocurrir. Recuperar este sentimiento es un giro refrescante, a diferencia de, digamos, tener que destruir otra âEstrella de la Muerteâ. No malinterprete mi comentario. No creo que âLos Ãltimos Jediâ sea mejor que âEl Despertar de la Fuerzaâ (2015). Aquella, me parece, era una especie de homenaje y siendo la primera pelÃ­cula de âStar Warsâ en aÃ±os, fue como un golpe emocional muy poderoso, ademÃ¡s de encariÃ±arnos con los nuevos personajes. En ese sentido, no podemos culpar a âLos Ãltimos Jediâ, ya que, bueno, su misiÃ³n era otra: seguir con la historia. Los defectos, lo que mÃ¡s me molestÃ³ de la cinta es, creo, una cosa muy clara. Principalmente, el uso del humor y eso incluye a ciertas creaturas que viven en la isla de Luke, sobre todo los Porgs, que se volvieron famosos incluso antes de que saliera la pelÃ­cula. Estos seres fabricados exclusivamente para vender juguetes son los nuevos Ewoks, la diferencia es que aquellos al menos ayudaron a derrocar al Imperio GalÃ¡ctico. Los Porgs no hacen nada y alimentan el seguido desatinado sentido del humor de este filme. DeberÃ­a existir un parÃ¡metro que cuente la cantidad de bromas, pero no recuerdo que las otras cintas de âStar Warsâ tuvieran tantas. En fin, quizÃ¡ me equivoco y la Ãºnica razÃ³n por la que me molestaron es porque no estÃ¡n bien colocadas y casi ninguna me hizo reÃ­r. Parecen fuera de lugar y hablando de eso, hablemos de la historia de Finn y Rose, que ciertamente se desvÃ­a de la trama central por un buen rato. DirÃ­a que sÃ­, que tambiÃ©n se siente como algo fuera de lugar, y al menos asÃ­ me lo parecÃ­a al principio, pero conforme fue avanzando le fui tomando cariÃ±o a todo lo que les ocurrÃ­a, sobre todo cuando se encuentran con un nuevo personaje interpretado por Benicio del Toro. Hay tambiÃ©n aquÃ­ un discurso sobre la guerra y los poderosos que, viÃ©ndolo bien, podrÃ­a estar de mÃ¡s, pero creo que funciona. Esta aventura secundaria es casi como su propia historia individual, si se une podrÃ­a ser un buen cortometraje. âStar Warsâ trata de aventuras. De misiones divertidas con un montÃ³n de naves disparando lÃ¡sers. Entretenimiento, quizÃ¡, en un nivel mÃ¡s infantil, pero tambiÃ©n forma parte de esta saga. Estas secuencias emocionantes son bien llevadas en la cinta. En cuanto acciÃ³n, hay un par de destacables. No dirÃ© mÃ¡s al respecto, pero la mejor involucra unos tipos con armaduras rojas que se ven geniales. AsÃ­ pues, se crea un excelente balance entre contarnos una historia nueva e interesante, que nos mantiene atentos todo el tiempo (y con esto me refiero a todo lo que no tenga que ver con Finn y Rose que, aunque estÃ¡ bien, no forma parte de la trama central, al menos por un rato), ademÃ¡s de tener buenas escenas de acciÃ³n. Y no cabe duda que una cosa necesita de la otra para funcionar.  Estamos ante un producto sÃ³lido que no teme tomar riesgos. Y bueno, como siempre, estÃ¡n los claros guiÃ±os al pasado que son imposibles de evadir. Creo que todos son bien llevados, en especial el mÃ¡s importante y evidente. No se sienten invasivos y dejan que la historia nueva fluya. Cualquier fanÃ¡tico de âStar Warsâ la disfrutarÃ¡ mucho. Si no son fans, como ya dije al principio, encontrarÃ¡n una pelÃ­cula de ciencia ficciÃ³n y aventuras muy entretenida. Pero le va a faltar lo mÃ¡s importante: hay que ser sensibles a la fuerza. Director: Rian Johnson. Elenco: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Laura Dern, Benicio del Toro. GÃ©nero: Ciencia ficciÃ³n / Aventura. ClasificaciÃ³n: B DuraciÃ³n: 152 minutos. Historia. La cinta nos ubica casi justo donde nos dejÃ³ la anterior. Rey (Daisy Ridley) llega con Luke (Mark Hamill) y le entrega su sable lÃ¡ser, que su padre le arrancÃ³ aÃ±os atrÃ¡s."
"Dec 18, 2017",POSITIVE,"The force is strong with Rian Johnson, who delivers de most exciting, risky, adult and entertaining Star Wars movie since, well, you know which one. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Dec 18, 2017",POSITIVE," The loudest grumblers in the horde are probably those who expected the most boring, conventional developments coming off The Force Awakens — those who lost themselves in Reddit rabbit holes and bullshit-clickbait articles in which the creative team’s gracious consideration of absurdly insistent questions about parents or provenance became confused for “They told us it was important, but it wasn’t!” While they were busy bitching, Rian Johnson went and made what is easily the best visual representation of any Star Wars story in the last 34 years. To boot, it renders the ragged edges of The Force Awakens smoother, too (although not enough to bump that movie’s rating up any higher). That film rode on the whimsy of nostalgia. The Last Jedi is about the weight of time, from milliseconds to millennia, and the if and how of whether characters buckle and break under it. It’s also one exhilarating cliffhanger after another, dovetailing stories that tuck into each other at different times with action often rooted in character development. Poe must learn that blowing shit up without regard for strategy is a fool’s errand. Rey must understand her embrace of the past and how it plagues her is worth holding only to a point — which plays out in a profoundly trippy, Lynchian scene in which we seem to see every millisecond’s iteration of herself up to that moment in time and stretching out into infinity. What is down there in the island’s pit – tempting her, tempting us, tempting the world? Finn must move past the naive belief of good and bad in wartime, nudged there by the great Benicio Del Toro, doing what can best be described as Tom Waits’ Jack Sparrow and marvelously so. Even Kylo Ren has much to learn about himself and the perils of clinging to symbolic costumes and small dreams. (People complaining about him trashing the mask – which is in the trailers, so shush – also overlook that it’s a way for Kylo to manipulate Rey into seeing precisely what she did to him during that lightsaber battle in the forest.) Luke must not only come to understand his failures of tutelage and trust but recognize, and reconcile, them in a way that helps him find the peace he seeks — namely to say killing that which you fear will not necessarily save you. The Last Jedi is not a film about easy answers. It shouldn’t be about easy answers. It is about letting the scars show and that solidarity matters, morals matter, kindness matters. Hubris has consequences. So does heroism. God forbid you get something more complex and challenging than another lollipop-licking sugar rush. Here’s a film of majestic wonders built up, torn down and not necessarily rebuilt. A thing of beauty. A work of art. A marvel of moviemaking. Let it come to a perfunctorily boring conclusion if it must under J.J. Abrams and Chris Terrio. We have Johnson’s fresh-slate trilogy to which we can now most definitely look forward."
"Dec 18, 2017",POSITIVE," After the thunderous reception for J.J. Abrams' Episode VII: The Force Awakens two years ago, writer-director Rian Johnson had a lot to live up to with Episode VIII. And he delivers more than anyone expected: a lucid, entertaining film that operates on four distinct planes, deepens all of its characters, enriches the mythology and constantly surprises the audience with twists and turns. It's a little overwhelming, a nonstop two and a half hours of action and intensity without any time to catch your breath. But there's also a steady stream of sharp humour to help keep things in perspective. Visual effects were always a huge part of Star Wars movies, and The Last Jedi is no exception to using innovative technologies that made the whole experience possible. The story picks up straight away, as the First Order led by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) presses its advantage to wipe out the rebellion for good. Snoke is playing his apprentice Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) off against General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) for maximum effect as they launch an attack. Rebel General Leia (Carrie Fisher) is trying to protect her scrappy army, with pilot Poe (Oscar Isaac) trying against the odds to find a way to get them to safety. He sends rebel hero Finn (John Boyega) and mechanic Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) on a mission to track down a hacker who can give them a chance against the First Order. Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley) has tracked down Leia's brother, jaded Jedi master Luke (Mark Hamill), who is trying to teach her hard truths about the Force. Each of these characters finds a surprising connection to others, derailing plans and sending each person on an unexpected journey. The way Johnson orchestrates all of this is remarkable because it's both coherent and compelling. And the actors beautifully inhabit the characters, offering telling glimpses beneath the surface. Driver has the strongest role, grappling with three other main characters to understand his destiny. It's dark and complex, and unnervingly moving. Ridley and Hamill also have powerfully gripping moments, while Isaac gets to make good on his scallywag promise in the previous film. And in her final role, the late Fisher brings a wonderfully knowing, sassy edge to Leia. Most of the action here takes place during epic, seriously exhilarating space battles. But there are also visits to a whizzy casino planet and more time on Luke's isolated island, populated by porgs, those almost insanely cute critters who get the film's edgiest joke. Johnson also offers several echoes of the saga's iconic moments, mainly the shift of balance from The Empire Strikes Back as the rebels are constantly on the run. It's a thunderously entertaining film with powerfully thoughtful themes about the blurry nature of good and evil. Bring on Episode IX."
"Dec 18, 2017",POSITIVE," Upon the release of J.J. Abrams’ “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” I was moderately excited for a new film in the franchise after the decade-long absence. I’m a fan of the series for the most part, having liked almost all of the films, so a new trilogy under a new studio and different writers/directors sounded like it could be something special. While I enjoyed Abrams’ film enough, there wasn’t really any getting around the fact that he had basically remade “A New Hope” with some new characters thrown in. However, at the very least, it freed up the franchise and opened the door to allow writer/director Rian Johnson to take it in any number of new directions, which brings us to the latest entry in the main saga: “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” a big, bold installment that just might be the most ambitious film of the series yet. The film opens as the Rebels are fleeing their base in a desperate attempt to escape the First Order. Thanks to some risky maneuvers from Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), in direct violation of General Leia’s (Carrie Fisher) orders, the Rebels are able to get away. However, their victory is cut short upon discovering that the First Order has somehow managed to find a way to track them even in lightspeed, putting them in another dire situation that has them short on fuel and ships, with the enemy closing in. In a last-ditch effort to get away, Finn (John Boyega) and his new friend Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) go on a mission to knock out the First Order’s tracker, but first, they must locate a master codebreaker in order to get aboard the enemy ship without being noticed. Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley) has found Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and tries to explain to him everything that has happened. Unfortunately, Luke is now of the mind that he can’t help them and that the Jedi should be allowed to end, but luckily Rey is quite persistent, eventually leading Luke to at least give her a few lessons in regards to The Force. During her stay on the island, she begins to have telepathic communications with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), leading her to believe that there just might be another way to end the Rebels’ struggles if Luke should remain in his current mindset. With the First Order continuing to close in on the last of the resistance, our heroes must once again put everything on the line in order to try and return peace to the galaxy. As I mentioned, I wouldn’t go so far as to say that Abrams’ film was a letdown, but it was a little disappointing to find that it had a distinct lack of originality, practically following “Episode IV” beat-for-beat. However, when it was announced that Rian Johnson, the man behind such fascinating projects as “Looper,” “The Brothers Bloom,” and “Brick,” would be handling the next film in the main saga, the only thing I could think was that this is exactly what the series needs: a breath of fresh air, someone to give it the heaping dose of originality that it needed to truly stand out. With the release of “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” I’m very glad to say that that’s exactly what we get. Somehow Johnson has managed to take a large ensemble cast of characters and give each of them their due as he weaves multiple thrilling and engrossing storylines together.  I suppose a fair comparison would be Joss Whedon and his “Avengers” films, but in this case, it’s even more complex thanks to having multiple characters in different locations throughout the film, on top of having more intricate plots. From this, one would assume that Johnson must have done it before, but when you remember his rather humble works before this, the accomplishment becomes even more impressive. Not only has Johnson given the saga a good dose of originality, but he’s also thrown in a good smattering of humor as well. That’s not to say that Abrams’ film didn’t have its comedic moments, but with “The Last Jedi,” Johnson really gives you a number of good moments to laugh at, sometimes completely out of the blue or in the middle of a supposedly serious scene. This is not to mention the multiple thrilling action scenes that are strategically placed throughout the film, sequences which never becoming monotonous and always add to the story instead of just being thrown in for the hell of it as some films like to do. However, what’s perhaps most important is that Johnson has shown that he understands these characters and cares deeply about them, demonstrated through his emotionally-rich narratives that treat the characters reverently. There may be a few directions the film goes in that hard-core fans won’t like, but it’s a film that takes risks, instead of playing it mundanely safe like “The Force Awakens” did. What Johnson has done here is incredibly ambitious, and it’s paid off with the best “Star Wars” film in a long time, one that shows that there is quite a lot of potential ahead for “Episode IX” (that is, if Chris Terrio doesn’t completely ruin it like he did “Justice League”). It’s a shame that Johnson couldn’t simply move on to the next installment, but given that he’s now working on his very own trilogy, there’s more than enough reason to be excited for what’s to come. Simply put, “The Last Jedi” is a grand step forward, one that we can only hope will light the way for the franchise’s future. 3.5/4 stars."
"Dec 18, 2017",POSITIVE," (In our Spoiler Reviews, we take a deep dive into a new release and get to the heart of what makes it tick...and every story point is up for discussion. In this entry: Rian Johnson's exciting, unpredictable Star Wars: The Last Jedi.) With Star Wars: The Last Jedi, writer-director Rian Johnson takes the Star Wars saga into uncharted territory. Johnson resists fan service at nearly every turn, crafting the most surprising, most exciting film in the entire Star Wars franchise. A film that both rejects and embraces legacy; a film that takes characters we've grown to love and exposes their flaws, while also revealing that they're more than their flaws. Our The Last Jedi spoiler review takes a deep dive into this wonderful, unpredictable new entry in the Star Wars saga. Spoilers follow, obviously.Luke Skywalker tried to warn us. When the full trailer for Star Wars: The Last Jedi hit the web, there was particular emphasis given to one of Mark Hamill's lines: ""This is not going to go the way you think."" It was almost as if both Luke and director Rian Johnson were dropping a not-so-subtle hint about what was in store for audiences with the new Star Wars film: whatever it is you imagined would happen; whatever fan theory you obsessed over between the release of The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi; whatever assumption you made – chuck them all into the trash, because this is not going to go the way you think.With The Last Jedi, director Rian Johnson attempts to tell Star Wars fans that it's okay to let the past go, that staying firmly rooted in one safe space is limiting, and that there's an entire galaxy out there to explore. Word broke recently that Johnson will forge a brand new Star Wars trilogy removed from the ongoing Skywalker saga, and The Last Jedi almost feels like a test pilot for that, a film that says there's so much more to this universe than sacred texts. That may threaten some, but to me, it's the most exciting development in the Star Wars saga for quite some time.J.J. Abrams' endlessly entertaining Star Wars: The Force Awakens approached the Star Wars saga the way a really great cover band recreates classic songs for an admiring audience. Abrams' film hit all the right notes, played all the old familiar keys, and reminded audiences why they fell in love with Star Wars to begin with. But if Abrams' film is like a collection of well-known hits from a really tight cover band, Johnson's is like jazz fusion – a blend of styles and moods that reminds you of something familiar before going off into wild, unexpected new places.It would've been easy, and possibly more digestible, for Johnson to emulate The Empire Strikes Back with his film the way Abrams borrowed from A New Hope. Instead, Johnson takes what the audience knows and expects from Empire and flips it on its head. The Last Jedi isn't interested in recreating the past. But it's not exactly adhering to the logic of the villainous Kylo Ren, who suggests that Rey ""Let the past die – kill it if you have to."" Instead, it's saying that it's time to let the past be the past, and try to think about the future. The Last Jedi opens with a jaw-dropping space battle that kicks-off with surprisingly funny banter. As hot-shot pilot Poe (Oscar Isaac; ridiculously handsome) hails First Order flunky General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson, practically breaking a tooth as he chews on the scenery) over a radio and stalls him with a funny back-and-forth, The Last Jedi is wasting no time in cluing the audience in to the fact that this is not going to be like any other Star Wars film you've seen before. That's not to say the other Star Wars films lack humor. In fact, they're loaded with it. But the other films in the saga tend to work their way up to the comedy. Last Jedi hits you with it right out of the gate.The humor gives way to a visually stunning battle sequence, in which members of the weary, outnumbered Resistance, led by General Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher) war against the might of the First Order, Star Wars' version of the alt-right. The staging of this sequence wastes no time in revealing director Rian Johnson's considerable skill. In wordless moments, Johnson is able to create remarkable pathos with a group of doomed characters we barely know anything about, particularly Veronica Ngô, playing Paige Tico. Paige is a brand new character, but don't get too attached to her, because she's about to meet her end. But rather than having her be a casualty in the background, The Last Jedi gives her a heart-pounding, emotional moment of heroism as she does everything in her power to drop a series of bombs. We know absolutely nothing about this character, yet the combination of Johnson's direction, Ngô's performance, Bob Ducsay's editing, Steve Yedlin's cinematography and that unbeatable, iconic music from John Williams hooks us. As Paige fiddles with the medallion on a necklace around her neck right before things go south, we're drawn in and and invested into this character, and we feel a surprising sense of loss when she dies.From here, The Last Jedi rockets off into multiple directions, yet keeps coming back to the same place. Like Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, this isn't so much a movie about battle as it is a movie about retreat. The First Order has the Resistance on the ropes, and Poe, Leia and company are forced to run for their lives. An attack leaves Leia in a coma, and puts the mysterious yet stylish-as-hell Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) in charge. Poe finds himself constantly clashing with Holdo, to the point that he sanctions a secret side-mission to possibly undermine her. That mission involves former Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega), freshly awoken from the coma he was in at the end of The Force Awakens, and hero-worshipping maintenance worker Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), sister of Paige.Finn and Rose jet off to the casino planet of Canto Bight, which looks like something out of a James Bond film, only with more aliens. The pair are trying to find a master codebreaker, but instead team up with the weird, possibly crazy DJ (Benicio del Toro, doing what I'm 99% sure is a Tom Waits impression).Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley) is on an island on the planet of Ahch-To, trying to convince Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker to come out of retirement to help save the day. But Luke isn't the noble hero Rey had heard of from stories; instead, he's a bitter, angry loner who wants the Jedi to die once and for all. While on the island, Rey's Force powers enable to her communicate with Luke's nephew and former student turned bad guy, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Ren is still dealing with emotional issues – stabbing your father with a lightsaber can do that to a guy. Rey is convinced that she can turn Ren from the Dark Side to the Light, thus giving the Resistance a much-needed ally. Luke doesn't buy it.And Luke is right.All of these threads eventually converge into a big, emotional showdown where Luke finally faces his fears, Rey accepts her place as a Jedi, and Kylo Ren becomes the angry, bitter, unredeemable new leader of The First Order. And nothing will ever be the same again. First thing's first: I don't know if I'm ready to declare The Last Jedi as the best Star Wars movie, but it's certainly the best looking film in the franchise. Rian Johnson brings an auteur's eye to this film, and crafts something that looks and feels remarkably different than the other Star Wars films. Here, Johnson is borrowing from both Akira Kurosawa and Michael Powell & Emeric Pressburger – this is a samurai film crossed with a classical musical. The Star Wars universe should, in theory, have no real limits visually, and Johnson embraces that with gusto. There's a scene set in the throne room of Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) where everything as far as the eye can see – from the walls to the guards – are a shade of sharp crimson. Then there are the planets – the stark, secluded loneliness of Ahch-To; the glitz and glam covering up corruption on Canto Bight; the planet Crait, with its salty surface covering bright red earth underneath.Then there are the directorial flourishes Johnson employs – slow-motion used during the opening bombing run; the audio dropping out when Holdo sacrifices herself by ramming her ship at lightspeed through a First Order fleet; the anime-infused climactic lightsaber duel between Ren and Luke. The Last Jedi is visually thrilling, full of shot compositions that will floor and thrill you in equal measure.The climax of The Last Jedi involves a moment when Kylo Ren and Luke face off in the shadow of looming AT-AT walkers, and it's just about the most visually stunning composition that's ever been created in a Star Wars film. It's as if the very legacy of the franchise as a whole is looming over this one climactic moment; a moment where Luke wins not by besting Ren in combat, but rather by telling him that his warped beliefs are flawed, and that his line of thinking will never truly result in victory.The visuals aren't the only things here that are going to surprise you. Right from the start, Johnson is unapologetic in his quest to shake things up. Anyone who formed fan theories since The Force Awakens hit theaters in 2015 will quickly find all their theorizing was for naught. While sequels are, by their nature, the very definition of fan service, The Last Jedi isn't interested in trafficking in it. This might be viewed with hostility by hardcore fans, but that's not what Johnson is trying to do here. Instead, he's trying to tell a story about both embracing and letting go of the past. In the process, he's sending a message to every Star Wars filmmaker who comes after him: there are so many new stories to tell here. Go out and find them.In the book The Art of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Johnson says that when it came to making The Last Jedi, recreating things from the past weren't as essential as forging the future. ""At the end of the day, it's not the documents in the archives,"" the filmmaker says. ""It's not old interviews. It's not research. The only research that really matters is us reaching back to when you were six and thinking, 'What were the things that made Star Wars feel real then – that inspired me, personally?' And then following your heart with those things.""""The vibe was always, 'We all know this world in our bones from growing up with it. But let's make something new and exciting in it,'"" Johnson continues. ""That was something that we all shared, and we all very naturally felt.""In the same book, Neal Scanlan, who created the creature effects for The Last Jedi, sums this approach up succinctly. ""We're waving goodbye to the legacy that is the original films and prequels, even to The Force Awakens,"" Scanlan says. ""Rian is taking this film to a place that I hope the fans adore and is as successful as any other place that we've been. But it's definitely a place that we haven't been before. And that's liberating, isn't it – because where does Star Wars go from here? What a fantastic way to say, 'Goodbye.' And 'Let's go somewhere else.'""""Let's go somewhere else,"" is The Last Jedi's mantra. That iconic moment from the end of The Force Awakens, where Rey hands Luke his old lightsaber? It was a setup for a hysterical scene where Luke chucks it over his shoulder and walks away without a word. You thought Snoke was going to be the ultimate big bad? Nope – he gets killed halfway through this film. Rey and Kylo Ren are obviously going to team up, since Ren is still redeemable, just like Darth Vader, right? Absolutely not. Ren is too far gone, and now he's the official big bad. Surely, Rey's mysterious parents must be some iconic characters we already know, thus making her the prototypical chosen one! Wrong again: they were nobodies, and they're dead now. Every step of the way, Johnson and The Last Jedi are reminding you, ""This is not going to go the way you think.""Is that a cheat? No doubt some will think it is. And that's their right. But personally speaking, I found this approach to be refreshing. I loved The Force Awakens, but I freely admit that it was a collection of greatest hits moments. While there's nothing wrong with that, there's something inherently more exciting about a film like The Last Jedi; a film that doesn't want to hold its audience's hand but rather wants to push them head-first into a new, possibly dangerous direction.The Last Jedi is a film about legacy: both honoring it, and also tearing it down. Tearing down a legacy can be scary, but sometimes it's necessary to move forward. They say you should never meet your heroes because they will ultimately disappoint you, and that's true here when Rey meets Luke. Rey has had an idealized image in her mind of Luke as this great hero, but instead she finds a broken, bitter man. A man who rejects the Jedi because, when you really think about it, everything the Jedi did ended in failure. Luke is haunted by this failure, particularly the failure surrounding his training of Kylo Ren, AKA Ben Solo. Luke thought he could train Ben to become part of a great new generation of Jedi, but he was unable to help his apprentice resist the Dark Side.To Rey, Luke was the key to everything. If she could just get him to come back to help the Resistance, maybe all the pieces would finally come together, and the world would start to make sense again. But it's not that simple. What's true in real life is apparently also true in mystical space operas: everything is complicated, and there are no easy answers. Hamill is so good here, delivering a quiet, dignified yet somber performance; embodying both strength and weakness in equal measure. I sincerely hope he'll be back in the next film in some capacity.Rey isn't the only person who ascribed to the belief that Luke was the key to everything. Early in the film, Snoke snarls at Ren, ""As long as Skywalker lives, hope lives in the galaxy."" In Snoke's mind, if they can kill Luke, the Resistance will fall. But The Last Jedi rejects this ideology. Instead, it has Luke tell Rey that the Force is bigger than just the Jedi. That the Force belongs to everyone. And so does hope. One person like Luke might become a symbol of hope, but if you tear that symbol down, it doesn't mean the hope has vanished forever.  At one point, Luke, frustrated with just about everything, decides to burn down the sacred Jedi tree on his island that also houses books of the sacred Jedi texts. Before he can make this happen, the ghost of Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) shows up for a surprise visit. It's worth noting here that Johnson and company have rejected the cartoony CGI Yoda so prevalent in the prequels for a good old fashioned puppet, and the results are delightful. Yoda uses his powers to burn the tree down himself, which instantly shocks Luke. ""The sacred Jedi texts!"" he cries. When Yoda asks if Luke ever even read them, Luke stammers. Here is the philosophy of the film as a whole: it's okay to leave what you once held sacred behind. At the same time, however, The Last Jedi isn't entirely letting the past go. In a reveal near the end that happens so subtly and quickly that I'm convinced a lot of people missed it, we see that Rey has saved the Jedi texts and stored them away on the Millennium Falcon.Like Dunkirk, one of the messages of The Last Jedi is that retreat is not the same thing as surrender. At the end of Dunkirk, a soldier feeling ashamed tells an old, blind man: ""All we did was survive."" ""Sometimes, that's enough,"" the blind man replies. The heroes in The Last Jedi aren't winning battles; all they're doing is surviving. But for now, that's enough. The Resistance will live to fight another day.The spirit of this message is most embodied by the series' most exciting new character, Rose, played with irresistible charm by Kelly Marie Tran. Rose and Finn are drawn together by chance: she catches him trying to escape at one point – an action she finds repulsive. Rose's sister Paige died for the Resistance, and for someone to flee when the going gets tough is unthinkable. Rose is also the most moral character in the film. When she and Finn end up on Canto Bight, Finn is seduced by the planet's glitz, but Rose reveals the seedy underbelly of it all. This is a planet of war profiteers; the richest people in the galaxy are those who gleefully sell weapons to both the First Order or The Resistance; it doesn't matter who, as long as they get paid.One of Finn's character traits is that he tends to run away. His whole arc in The Force Awakens began when he ran from the First Order. Here, too, he tries to run several times, but Rose keeps drawing him back in. So much so that in the film's big climactic moment, Finn decides to finally take a stand by sacrificing himself by flying directly into a battering ram. Here, at last, he's showing Rose that he's not a coward who flees. But curiously enough, Rose stops him, ramming her ship into his, endangering her life in the process. I'm sure people will take issue with this: after all, Finn was possibly going to save lives with his sacrifice, so wasn't it worth it? Not according to the philosophy of The Last Jedi, which is also the philosophy of Rose. When Finn asks her why she stopped him, she utters one of the most powerful lines in this entire goofy, exciting, dramatic franchise: she tells Finn that this is how they win: ""Not by killing what we hate but by saving what we love."" I wanted more of Tran in this film, but the time we get with her is wonderful. Just like Ridley in The Force Awakens, the actress is a great find, and deserves a huge career.Speaking of Ridley, she's once again a welcome presence here, although she too seems to take a backseat so others can step out in front. This isn't entirely a bad thing, since the other characters are strong, but I still felt her absence more than I would've liked. Nonetheless, Rey remains one of the franchise's most interesting protagonists. Rey is super-powered, but she's been alone so long that she doesn't quite understand her own strength, or her own place in this ever-expanding universe. She had been counting on two specific things to show her the way: Luke, and being reunited with her parents. But remember: this is not going to go the way you think. Luke does help Rey slightly, but not as much as she might've liked. She turns away from him with the belief that she can bring Kylo Ren over to the Light, and that they can perhaps find solace in each other. Ren is open to part of that idea, but he has no intention of turning to the Light. He wants Rey to rule by his side in the darkness. Rey rejects this idea, and Ren destroys the last element of hope she has: he reveals the truth about her parents. A truth that he says she always knew deep down inside.So who are Rey's parents? Are they Skywalkers? Are they Kenobis? Are they Solos? No. They're nobodies. They were a pair of scrappers who sold Rey for money as a child, and ended up dead in a junk heap somewhere. ""You have no place in this story,"" Ren tells her. ""You are from nothing. You're nothing."" Buried in these cruel words is a spark of hope: Rey may be from nothing, but she certainly is more than that. ""I will not be the last Jedi,"" Luke says at the end, and Johnson quickly cuts to a shot of Rey. She's the hope for the future. There's something so refreshing about this. A generation of people raised on Harry Potter, and other Hero's Journey stories, have come to accept the chosen one narrative. Hell, the original Star Wars itself was guilty of embracing this narrative device. But Rey isn't a chosen one, in the grand scheme of things. She's just someone who happens to be extremely Force sensitive, and she can help be part of a rebellion that will burn down the First Order.  Kylo Ren was a fun bad guy in The Force Awakens. There, he was an angry, sort-of whiny Darth Vader fanboy who hides behind a mask he doesn't even need. The Last Jedi turns him into something more dangerous. At the start of the film, he smashes that mask of his, which is a clever way for Johnson to suggest that the character is rejecting his villainous nature and will eventually turn back to the Light. Instead, the character is just transforming into something else; something darker. Time and time again, The Last Jedi keeps hinting that Ren will be redeemed. But one of the coolest things this movie does is reject that idea, and reveal that Kylo Ren truly is a villain. He's a complex, conflicted villain, yes. But he's still a villain. After an incredibly badass fight scene where he and Rey fight off Snoke's guards, the audience is keyed up – ready for Ren to embrace Rey and help the Resistance. But Ren instantly smothers the flames of that idea. He doesn't give a shit about the Resistance, or his mother, Leia. He just wants to be in charge, and he wants Rey to help him. When she rejects him, he's apoplectic. Adam Driver handles all of this masterfully, creating the most interesting movie villain since Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight. I'm sure there will still be fans who want to theorize that Kylo Ren could still be redeemed in the next film. But Leia pretty much puts the nail in this coffin when she tells Luke that she accepts the fact that her son is gone for good.Speaking of Leia, almost every moment Carrie Fisher is on screen in this film is met with a sort of hushed reverence. I'm sad to say that Leia isn't featured nearly as much as I had hoped she would, and that the film ends without really resolving anything for her character. I know this isn't the film's fault – no one could've guessed Fisher would die before the new trilogy had been concluded. Yet it's still sad to realize that this is the last time we'll get to spend with Leia. it really seems clear now that Force Awakens was intended to be Han Solo's swan song, Last Jedi was Luke's, and that Episode IX would belong to Leia. We'll never have that happen now, which, quite frankly, sucks.Still, Fisher makes the most of what she has here. Once again, the actress brings her droll, dry wit to the part, and it's a hoot to watch her banter with Oscar Isaac's Poe. ""Get your head out of your cockpit,"" she tells him at one point. When Luke and Leia are reunited, the emotion of the scene is tempered by Fisher's delivery of, ""I know what you're going to say – I changed my hair."" (Note: as I'm sure anyone could've guessed, Fisher improvised this line.)Another actress I wanted more of: Laura Dern. Dern's Holdo is a dynamite character, and The Last Jedi bumbles a bit by killing her off. That said, the character dies in one of the most heroic moments in the franchise, driving her ship at lightspeed through a First Order ship (the audience I saw the film with lost their goddamn minds at this scene; hooting, hollering and shaking the very ground of the theater itself. It ruled, folks). Holdo's glam looks contrasted with her hard-ass nature are perfectly handled by Dern, and she nails one of the most emotional moments in the film as well. As she and Leia part ways for the very last time, they both attempt to say ""May the Force be with you,"" in unison, then stop, laughing. ""You go, I've said it enough,"" Leia says (another line improvised by Fisher). ""May the Force be with you, always,"" Dern's Holdo replies sweetly, her hand on top of Leia's. Reader, I wept.I can't end the ""what works"" section without highlighting the stars of The Last Jedi: PORGS. I know there are porg haters out there, and frankly, I want nothing to do with these individuals. The porgs are delightful, cute animals, and I love them and want them to be protected at all costs. Long live porgs. This is going to be brief, because the good far outweighs the bad. That said, The Last Jedi has some issues. Pacing is the biggest one. This is the longest Star Wars film so far, and it feels like it. Johnson does his best to hustle from one location to the next, but the narrative has a tendency from time to time to drag.The biggest example of this are the scenes on Canto Bight. Which is a shame, because a huge chunk of the film's message is established on these scenes. But the very nature of the story, with its many moving parts, inadvertently makes this section of the film feel like a diversion. We're much more interested in spending time with Luke and Rey.Lumped in with the Canto Bight problems are Benicio del Toro's character, who is called DJ in press materials but never really has a name in the film. Del Toro's performance is fun – he's doing some sort of Tom Waits by way of Roger Rabbit thing, and it's pretty amusing. That said, the film never really finds much use for him. He eventually betrays Finn and Rose, and then vanishes from the film. I'm sure he'll be back for the next movie, but for now, the character was little more than a distraction.The same, sadly, can be said for Gwendoline Christie's Captain Phasma. Once again, Phasma is a potentially awesome character who looks really cool, but like The Force Awakens, the film has no real use for her. She shows up near the end for a big showdown with Finn, which is entertaining, but also results in the character's death. Of course, there's always a chance she could come back, but if they're just going to bring her back for another one-note scene, maybe don't bother? Give Phasma something to do, damn it!The biggest mistake the new franchise has made so far is wasting Lupita Nyong'o in a brief motion capture performance as Maz Kanata, but if you thought her appearance in The Force Awakens left something to be desired, you'll be pining for it here. I get that the script is crowded and they didn't have much room for Maz, but the character literally Skypes in a quick appearance here, and it just comes across as a waste of time. Nyong'o deserves better.Johnson has said there are ""extensive"" deleted scenes for The Last Jedi, and I believe it, particularly when it comes to some loose threads. At one point, Luke tells Rey he's going to teach her ""three things,"" but only gets around to telling her two – was there a third thing that get left on the cutting room floor? If not, maybe they should've just changed this line to ""two things""? The same sort of issue arises with the Holdo/Poe subplot. Poe has problems with Holdo, which is fine on its own – he's spent years following Leia, so it would make sense that he clashes with his new boss. But Holdo's motivations are deliberately vague, and I have a feeling this is a result of deleted scenes. Holdo keeps her plan a secret from Poe, which leads Poe to actually mutiny (a fact that everyone sort of forgets about pretty quickly after it's over). I have a feeling that there was a scene or two where Holdo explains her decision to play things close to the vest by saying the Resistance suspected there was a First Order spy in their midst – the First Order is able to track The Resistance when they jump lightspeed, which you're not technically supposed to be able to do. But since such an explanation never comes up, it just makes Holdo's actions seem like a cheat to move the story forward, and I think Johnson is too smart a writer for that to have happened on purpose."
"Dec 18, 2017",NEUTRAL," 
As 
		luck would have it, I found myself in my favourite seat in one of my 
		least favourite press screening venues, in the epicenter of the 
		mightiest, most fanatical cinema fandom that ever fandomed.  Star Wars 
		folk to the left of me, discussing what temples had been invited to 
		the Los Angeles premiere, and had memorabilia autographed by Mark Hamill.  
		Star Wars folk to the right of me, in heated debate over whether gold or 
		copper tubing was more appropriate for a cosplay of Boba Fett from 
		Episode 5 (Aka Empire Strikes Back, for the less-initiated).  
		Apparently, this screening was the reward of Star Wars fan club 
		sweepstakes winners, and boy, were they hyped and ready to go.  Why 
		then, with so much palpable and audible excitement all around me, did 
		THE LAST JEDI leave me so flat? To 
		that end, we are reunited with young Rey, the desert scavenger who 
		discovered some new things about herself recently, and flew across space 
		to find the one person who could tell her how she might use these 
		attributes for the good of the Rebellion.  Maybe she can even persuade 
		this wise man to throw in with the good guys, as well?  Sadly, Luke 
		Skywalkers fighting days are over.  As did his predecessor, Obi Wan 
		Kenobi, Luke has chosen to live as a hermit.  Hes camped on the remote 
		planet Ahch-To, home of the first Jedi temple, far from any news about 
		the Rebellions imminent demise, or any requirement to do anything about 
		it.  Lukes pretty bitter about what his dream of mastering the Force 
		has brought him; the utter destruction of his temple and the murder of 
		his students and friends at the hands of his own nephew, the dark-sided 
		Kylo Ren, son of his sister, Leia, and late BFF Han Solo.  Rey pits her 
		stubbornness against the grouchy Jedi, intent on bringing him back into 
		the world he cant keep avoiding, to save the Rebel Alliance and stop 
		the First Order.  
		Watching THE LAST JEDI felt like fighting my own battle against the dark 
		side.  The film was so much of a hodgepodge of scattered storylines, 
		jumbled pacing, and lost momentum, crossed with affection for returning 
		beloved characters and heartfelt performances, that I still dont quite 
		know what to make of it.  Right 
		from the start, the kindergarten-level dialog; overloaded with 
		simplistic and clumsy exposition was like an ice bucket thrown over the 
		head.  It reminded me of some of the golden clunkers of the more 
		Lucas-heavy scripts of the dreadful second trilogy.  I mean, theres 
		stuff that was carried over from 2015s THE FORCE AWAKENS, like the 
		silliness of our oh-so-scary villain being named Snoke, which is the 
		phonetic representation of a cat heaving a hairball.  Im not expecting 
		Mamet or Cassavetes here, but having avoided such elementary dialog in 
		the previous film, it felt retrogressive to have braindead lines like 
		Lets go, BB-8, its now or never! Why arent your bay doors open? 
		Its all down to you! I wish I could put my fist through this whole 
		lousy beautiful town. said with all earnestness, while the passing of a 
		well-loved character from the original trilogy is only relayed to us in 
		a verbal report after a First Order attack.  What 
		is remarkable about THE LAST JEDI is the original crew, or the remnants 
		thereof:  How heartbreaking that it took so long for Mark Hamill and 
		Carrie Fisher, who were never hailed for their acting skills in their 
		time, to get their onscreen propers?  The tragic December 2016 loss of 
		Fisher left many wondering about her appearance as Princess Leia in this 
		film, and its gratifying how very much was completed and how central 
		her character is to the proceedings.  (There is a ridiculous bit 
		early on involving the Princess in peril thats just bizarre and silly, 
		but in the spirit of appreciation, well let it pass.)  Even so, 
		its Hamill, whos done some of his greatest work off screen, most 
		notably as the iconic voice of The Joker in the Batman animated series 
		of the 1990s (and its spinoffs), who really gets to shine.  He 
		digs deep to reclaim and fully flesh out the naïve farmboy whos been 
		through hell and back several times, and not entirely sure hes deserved 
		to live through any of it.  The characters themes of self-doubt, 
		betrayal, and shattered illusions, clash loudly against the family 
		belonging he shares with Leia and later with Rey, and the strength of 
		finally owning his own power and its inevitable consequences.  It is by 
		far the most satisfying aspect of the entire film, and an award-worthy 
		turn by Hamill.

		There is also an unexpected appearance by Laura Dern as a Resistance 
		officer who precedes and thwarts Poe in the Rebellion hierarchy.  
		Sporting a wavy pastel-purple do (Which deflects from her 
		unflattering, high-necked evening gown), Holdo hasnt Leias 
		patience or affection for the rakish Poe (Who Im sure mustve 
		reminded the Princess of another scapegrace pilot.), and the feeling 
		is more than mutual.  It isnt until a dire face-off against the First 
		Order that Poe sees Holdo for the courageous, true leader she is.  Derns 
		scene, along with those of Fisher and Hamill, give THE LAST JEDI the 
		heart and emotion it couldve used more of.  (However, R2-D2 does 
		give us a Kleenex-worthy glimpse of younger days.) Like 
		so much in the movie, developing these roles is lost to the jumpy, 
		stop-start momentum of the films pacing, and the sense that were 
		watching it in a vacuum.  Theres no nuance or style to the film, and 
		its the first one where I left with absolutely no questions, theories, 
		or speculation about what would happen in the next chapter.  I really 
		couldnt care less whether there would be another one in this line."
"Dec 18, 2017",NEUTRAL," Having successfully steered the Star Wars reboot, set 30 years after the defeat of the Galactic Empire, to a $US2.06 billion worldwide box office gross, the fleet-footed filmmaker has handed over the keys to an action adventure P Plater.  Rian Johnson (Brick, Looper) bangs the vintage vehicle up so badly, this reviewer would strenuously suggest the scrap heap were it not for the fact that Abrams has already signed on to direct Episode IX.  The writer-director might not be entirely responsible for the gear-grinding cinematic experience represented by The Last Jedi — the storyline, in which Rey (Daisy Ridley) seeks out a desolate Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the galaxy’s last hope — was always in danger of taking itself far too seriously.  Now that he has a device that can track them through hyperspace, all Leia and her followers can do is stay out of the range of his heavy artillery — until the fuel runs out.  Meanwhile, on a deserted and windswept island on the fringes of the known universe, Rey is attempting to persuade the monastic Skywalker to rejoin the fight.  In an unnecessary and quite frankly preposterous third subplot, Finn (John Boyega) and a new character, Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), race against the clock to locate an underworld figure who can help them neutralise the First Order’s tracking device, thus allowing the diminished rebel fleet to escape.   The Last Jedi boasts one spectacular set piece — a stylised light-speed collision between two warring mother ships — that hints at what Johnson and his team might have been capable of, under the right conditions.  And the filmmakers have some fun digs at the classic male action hero persona — in one scene, Leia refers to Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) as a trigger happy fly boy, in another she tells him to get his head out of his cockpit.  But while there’s a genuine poignancy to the late Carrie Fisher’s CGI-enhanced performance as Leia, that’s got nothing to do with what’s happening on screen.  Rey weeps so much she’s in danger of dehydration — presumably this has something to do with her natural Jedi empathy — and Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren is an erratic adversary at best.  In The Last Jedi, movie magic has been replaced by hocus pocus. Or perhaps even mumbo jumbo — never has the eastern-western pop psychology of the franchise rung so hollow.  The film Civil War is an anxiety-inducing experience from start to finish – but one scene in particular will likely stay with you long after the credits roll. A major film up for five awards at this year’s Oscars has been accused of “line by line” plagiarism in an explosive new report published on the eve of the event."
"Dec 18, 2017",POSITIVE," Can you bear one more opinion on this latest Star Wars episode? If you can it is, in brief, that The Last Jedi is good, in parts very good but not as good as The Force Awakens. It's too long but not tedious, it's often funny and full of action. I felt it was, at times, more imitation Star Wars because although it brandished its characters and tropes, its sensibility is quite superhero. The Last Jedi picks up, not from last year's Rogue One but from 2015's The Force Awakens. The Rebels, under Commander Leia (Carrie Fisher), are being pursued through space by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), his protege Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and their military commander Gen Hux (Domhnall Gleeson). Renegade rebel Poe (Oscar Isaac) prefers attack to flight so the film opens straight on to a fabulous action scene. Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley) has been despatched by Leia to find Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), holed up in the Skelligs. While Luke leads the Force thread, the battle between good and evil, the rest feels a bit standard issue action film lurching through one, or two, too many cycles of near peril. This is in part down to writer-director Rian Johnson and also down to patchy leads. Hamill and Fisher are above discussion, obviously Driver, Gleeson and Isaac really deliver on juicy characters, Rey is a bit earnest and the Finn (John Boyega) and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) side adventure and pairing are weak. As with comedy aimed at grown ups, comedy aimed at children very much depends on whether the central comic character hits your funny bone. Although there is humour sprinkled throughout this animation, the main source is Lupe, the comedy goat, voiced by Kate McKinnon, so, subtle it isn't. Although it is unlikely to enter into the realm of animation classics, Ferdinand is sweet and well-intentioned. Lupe is, apart from a brief appearance by a little girl called Nina, the only female character in a film based on male stereotypes. Adapted from a children's book of the same name the cartoon examines, albeit subtly, what it means to be a man in the super macho environment of a bull ranch in Spain. All of the young bulls want to grow up to be like their fathers and to gain the supreme honour of being chosen to fight in a bullring. The young Ferdinand is already against fighting when his father does not return from a bullfight so the calf runs away, finding an entirely different life on a flower farm. He grows into a remarkable specimen of giant bullhood (voiced by wrestler turned actor John Cena) and although assumptions are made about his nature, Ferdinand defies the stereotype. French documentarian Sonia Kronlund has, since 2002, broadcast a regular radio show whose objective is to show either new things or things that are generally only presented one way. In Afghanistan she found a subject worthy of both descriptions; Salim Shareen, prolific actor and filmmaker, a huge part of Afghan life, swamped wherever he goes, but simultaneously a symbol of a lesser-known Afghanistan. Sonia and Salim travel together in the interesting dynamic of her filming him whilst he makes a film based on himself, one of the four films he is making at the time. She records his fictionalised version and the real version, to the extent that he will allow it. When she gets to his home, she can speak to his eight sons, but not his six daughters or either of his two wives. The second wife he describes as a kind of treat to himself because his first one was older than him and a bit ugly. Kronlund's chain-smoking presence in the doc works well, her genuine anxiety over safety in the still violent country contrasting with Salim's very visible disregard for caution. The civil war was worse than the Soviet War they say, many, including Shareen, are barely literate because war stopped their education. They talk about it light-heartedly, even though most of them have lived through horror. It's one of many contradictions about the Taliban, defying yet traditionalist film maker Shareen, that make this documentary fascinating to a specific audience."
"Dec 18, 2017",POSITIVE," Here’s an assignment for budding film-makers. Make a movie. It must be the eighth in a series, following on from two trilogies, setting up a third for completion, yet seem like its own creature, familiar but fresh. The plot must be full of twists that feel both surprising and, once revealed, inevitable. It must feature fabulous sights — twin suns and exploding moons — but they must draw as much comment from the characters as you or I would give an egg whisk. No rubbernecking."
"Dec 18, 2017",POSITIVE," For those of us who were there at the beginning, Star Wars: The Force Awakens – released two years ago today – had a special significance. Not only did it mark the rebooting of the franchise by its new owner, Disney, it also reunited, finally, the much-loved stars of the original – Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill.  Given that some 32 years had elapsed since the last time the trio shared the screen, this was a very big deal indeed, giving J J Abrams’s already very impressive picture some real emotional heft. Two years on and with Looper director Rian Johnson taking over at the controls, the presence – and absence – of those three actors continues to cast a long shadow over the latest Star Wars film, the eighth in the series. Ford (after two years and several million web pages dedicated to the matter, I don’t think this counts as a plot spoiler) has bowed out, Fisher has died at the tragically early age of 60 and Hamill… Well, the good news – at least for fans of Luke Skywalker – is that after his appearance as little more than a hooded after-thought in The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi is very much his big moment.  The less good news is that you could hardly say that, at the age of 66 and barely recognisable as the boyish hunk he used to be, he grabs the light sabre with both hands. Fisher, by contrast, who died just a few months after completing filming, is a constant presence and rather lovely. Two scenes in particular stand out. The first she shares with a purple-haired and generally rather striking Laura Dern, who plays Vice Admiral Holdo. The second comes much later and is, of course, the one we’ve all been waiting for – when Leia and her Jedi brother, Luke, are finally reunited. Even in an over-long film that is just beginning to outstay its welcome, it’s a hairs-on-the-back-of-the-neck moment. Quite rightly, the film is dedicated to Fisher. Elsewhere, however, this is very much a film that – despite the reappearance of one much-loved old character and the most famous hologram in film history – belongs to the new Star Wars generation, a fact that will heighten interest in some parts of the audience and diminish it in others, just as Johnson’s clear decision to return humour to the sort of levels creator George Lucas would approve of will too. You won’t believe who poor Chewbacca now has to share the Millennium Falcon with. So what’s going on? The still startlingly estuary-accented Rey (Daisy Ridley) is on that strange island hermitage that looks a lot like Pembrokeshire with Luke, hoping to become a Jedi. Finn (John Boyega) is rushing around the galaxy with his new friend Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) looking for help. That leaves everyone else – Poe (Oscar Isaac), Leia and the rest of the Resistance gang – stranded on a slow-moving cruiser under relentless attack from the battle fleet of the First Order still led by that trio of baddies: Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis in performance-capture mode), the sporadically masked Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and the regularly out-manoeuvred General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson). Driver – playing the grandson of Darth Vader and a man with both patricide and matricide on his mind – is the pick of a young bunch that, elsewhere, still have some convincing to do if they’re ever to convert Star Wars fame into something resembling a fully rounded movie career. Some of the plot details from Johnson’s script (he writes as well as directs) don’t bear close examination, but the visual effects are stunning. Two attack sequences linger particularly impressively – the first involving the downing of a First Order dreadnought, and as for the second… well, just keep an eye on the aforementioned Vice Admiral Holdo.  Accompanying parents are likely to watch Ferdinand in an uncomfortable state of prolonged anxiety: how are the makers going to turn traditional Spanish bullfighting – particularly when it comes to the fate of the poor bull – into an acceptable subject for a children’s cartoon? Answer: with some difficulty, particularly once they’ve introduced another unpalatable fact – that bulls that are bred for fighting but fail to make the grade are sent to the slaughterhouse. As a direct result, Ferdinand (above) is surely one of the only children’s films ever to feature a chase sequence in which all the participants are dangling from meat-hooks. If you didn’t know, you could probably guess that Munro Leaf’s children’s book, on which the film is based, was written in less sensitive times. In 1936, in fact. Eight decades on, parents will be relieved to know that the story of the bull who would rather smell flowers than fight does eventually end happily (and politically correctly), even if we have to wait until a couple of minutes before the conclusion to be absolutely sure. Wrestler-turned-actor, John Cena lends his voice to the title role in a story that sees Ferdinand running away from the farm where he was bred, being adopted by a little girl and her flower-farming family, only to be recaptured. This time around, Ferdinand’s only chances of escape lie with a so-called ‘calming goat’ and his new bunch of bull friends. Kate Mackinnon and David Tennant stand out in a story that, despite the makers’ best intentions, may still cause upset for small or sensitive children. Shot Caller is a stylish and cleverly constructed thriller about the distinctly non-rehabilitating impact of prison, with the Danish Game Of Thrones star Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (left) doing an excellent job of playing an American yuppie who’s sent to jail after a fatal accident. Many years later, Jacob – now nicknamed Money – emerges as a terrifyingly violent and thoroughly muscled-up gang member. Just to put his allegiances beyond doubt, he has the words ‘White Pride’ tattooed across his shoulders. The mumbled dialogue can be difficult to follow and the sporadic violence sometimes unpleasant, but stuntman-turned- film-maker Ric Roman Waugh, who writes and directs, keeps the whole thing on track in a way that would impress even more if he hadn’t already had one go at the subject with the 2008 film Felon. "
"Dec 17, 2017",POSITIVE,"This chapter relies so much on its call-backs and references that it all feels a little bit too safe. But still a damn fine movie, pushing the story forward in style."
"Dec 17, 2017",NEUTRAL,The Last Jedi should be the last Jedi. My interest died along with Hans Solo who took with him that cowboys in space humor that made the franchise so special.
"Dec 17, 2017",POSITIVE," The core theme of the ongoing Star Wars narrative has always been one of balance – an equilibrium between light and dark, life and death. Balance is also the key to making a great Star Wars movie, with the directors of each new episode standing or falling on their ability to walk a tightrope between spectacle and substance, seriousness and absurdity – keeping both the fans and the first-timers happy. In this eighth episode in the official Star Wars saga, writer-director Rian Johnson (who made his name with such adventurous features as Brick and Looper) proves himself the master of the balancing act, keeping the warring forces of this intergalactic franchise in near-perfect harmony. Just as the film’s sound designers understand the tactical use of silence, so Johnson instinctively knows when to internalise or externalise the film’s multiple explosions – conjuring vast attack ships on fire and tiny individuals in torment with equal ease. Picking up where JJ Abrams’s The Force Awakens left off, The Last Jedi puts distance between Daisy Ridley’s Rey and John Boyega’s Finn, sending the latter chasing across the galaxy while the former searches for her true self on the remote island where Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) lurks. “Who are you?” Luke asks “Rey from Nowhere”. “Why are you here?” It’s one of several questions that Johnson tantalisingly dangles, teasing out answers over The Last Jedi’s record-breaking running time (this is the longest Star Wars movie to date), which only occasionally slips into bagginess. Is Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren “a new Vader” or just “a child in a mask”? Can the decimated Resistance really be “the spark that will light the fire” that will burn the First Order down? And is there more to Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron than just “jumping into an X-wing and blowing something up”? Armed with all the samurai-style sabre battles and eye-popping dogfights (both in dark space and on bright land) that a Star Wars fan could hope for, Johnson’s increasingly crowd-pleasing adventure packs its heftiest punch by respecting the narrative arcs of its disparate characters. Whereas certain previous instalments suffered from George Lucas’s drama-free formula of having two-dimensional ciphers explain the plot to each other, Johnson adheres to the maxim that “action is character”, nowhere more so than in the introduction of Kelly Marie Tran’s winning Rose Tico – already a firm fan favourite who turns out to be much more than a mere maintenance engineer for the Resistance. A recurrent motif of hands reaching across great divides becomes a defining image, with allies and enemies bound by strange ties, and cowardice and heroism easily confused. No wonder Rey finds herself gazing at her own image in a Wellesian hall of mirrors in one of the film’s most strikingly surreal sequences. There are some quibbles – a visit to a space casino seems distractingly diversionary, and a few minor elements are a little on-the-nose. But as the third act approaches, the crescendo of air-punching interludes accelerates, eliciting gasps, cheers and OMG whoops from an audience whom Johnson treats with respect, affection, and evident admiration."
"Dec 16, 2017",POSITIVE," On top of Star Wars: The Force Awakens two years ago, and the side trip last year to the stand-alone Rogue One, Disney has now more than confirmed the wisdom of rebooting Lucasfilm’s crown jewel saga with what just might be the best film in the entire series that started 40 years ago in the mind of George Lucas. That first movie, 1977’s Star Wars, is to date still the only one (and one of the very few science fiction films, period) to have garnered a Best Picture Oscar nomination. However, if the Academy is handing them out this year on the basis of sheer fun and big-canvas filmmaking at its zenith, then Star Wars: The Last Jedi would be more than deserving of the honor. In addition to brilliant action sequences and state-of-the-art CGI effects, there is strong character development as this chapter continues to pave the way for a new generation of stars to take on the mantle and lift it further into galaxies far far away. This one has it all and then some, and on top of everything else offers a poignant final goodbye to Carrie Fisher, who goes out with a strong presence as the Leia we know and love. She represents one of several terrific female characters that includes the addition of Laura Dern as Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo. On the surface Dern plays her as a no-nonsense operator and second-in-command, but you can tell she may not be exactly what she seems at first glance. As I say in my video review above, writer-director Rian Johnson asked premiere-goers not to give away key plot points, so I will stay in the spirit of that. But it’s safe to say this edition pretty much picks up where Force Awakens stopped. Harrison Ford’s Han Solo is gone. His son with Leia, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), is struggling with the Dark Side, but also surprising with his willingness to explore his psyche in pitched conversations with Rey (Daisy Ridley), who has an odd connection with him. She is a kick-ass Jedi-in-waiting as she has piloted the Millennium Falcon onto the island where Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has stowed away. Hoping to get inspiration and secrets of the Jedi spirit from him, all she really finds is a man who has put all that behind him and basically renounced everything he once was in the Jedi realm. Meanwhile, Leia is now commanding the Resistance but running out of gas as evil Snoke (Andy Serkis) and General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) are hot on their trail as the First Order seeks revenge and the destruction of the Resistance which is just trying to survive. These storylines intersect with others including the emergence of Poe, the hotshot pilot played by Oscar Isaac, who seems to be filling the wildcat void left by Solo’s demise. John Boyega is back as Stormtrooper-turned-Resistance maven Finn, though of the main players his character is the one still needing the most definition. He teams with a great new character, Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), a kick-ass firebrand I found very welcome to these proceedings as she seeks out some hackers. A colorful sequence set in a Vegas-style casino ramps up the action and leads to another new character, DJ, played amusingly by Benecio Del Toro as a slippery codebreaker. Johnson has stuffed so much material into this outing that it seems everyone gets their moment — and then some. Of course, no Star Wars would be worth its salt without a menagerie of creatures, and standouts here are the adorable Porgs, who will have audiences oohing and awwing, and have a nice sequence involving Chewbacca and a home-cooked meal. Also back of course are C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), a nostalgic visit with Luke and R2-D2, the newer crowd favorite droid BB-8, and — wait for it — Yoda in a beautiful scene with Luke. Frank Oz does the honors. At 2 hours and 32 minutes, the longest ever in the series, there are lots of highlights and probably a few too many endings, but the pièce de résistance of the Resistance has to be a lightsaber duel to top them all. Acting is first-rate, with Isaac coming into his own and Driver making Kylo Ren about as complex and fascinating as any character to ever travel in this galaxy. Hamill gets a showcase like Luke has never had and makes the most of a very satisfying return for Mr. Skywalker. The music from John Williams is a must, and as always simply soars. Producers are Kathleen Kennedy and Ram Bergman. Disney unleashes this massive blockbuster wide Friday. Do you plan to see Star Wars: The Last Jedi?  Let us know what you think.

"Dec 16, 2017",POSITIVE,"With The Last Jedi, there's a welcome return of hope for the Sequel Trilogy."
"Dec 16, 2017",POSITIVE," Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the eighth installment in the venerable, now-four-decades-old space-fantasy franchise, is a big, messy, uneven, but largely enjoyable follow-up to J.J. Abrams’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), which kick-started the new trilogy in grand fashion largely by returning to what worked in George Lucas’s 1977 original (to the point of following plot beats and themes in a manner than some felt was a bit too derivative). The Last Jedi does something similar, drawing heavily from the plot mechanics of The Empire Strikes Back (1980), which dispersed its cast of characters and sent them on parallel journeys of self-discovery that mined new depths in their various relationships while revealing others that, at the time, we couldn’t have imagined were in store.  Johnson, whose most recent film was the sci-fi thriller Looper (2012), but whose greatest accomplishment was his debut indie Brick (2005), which somehow merged the dialogue of ’40s film noir with a present-day high school setting, draws from Empire’s vast visual iconography and narrative structure (both are essentially extended chase films). Yet, as Abrams did two years ago, Johnson, who both wrote and directed, invests the material with his own sensibility and builds in enough twists that the old feels new. He has some genuinely brilliant visual ideas, one of the best being his staging the film’s climactic battle on a desolate salt flat whose glistening top layer of white when scraped away reveals a scarlet substrata that leaves us with the impression of copious bloodshed. Sometimes, however, his proclivities come at the film’s expense, such as his penchant for inserting quippy humor, sarcasm, and sight gags at odd times, which often undercuts the drama or simply smacks of too much effort. However, when he gets down to brass tacks and lets the drama unfold, he produces some of the most powerful and engaging sequences in any Star Wars film. The Last Jedi is not the best entry in the Star Wars franchise, but parts of it rank at the very top. The story picks up right where The Force Awakens left off, although Johnson makes the canny choice to make us wait a while before we find out what happens after would-be Jedi protagonist Rey (Daisy Ridley), having tracked down the legendary Jedi Master-turned-hermit Luke Skywalker (Mark Hammill), presents him with his lightsaber. Instead, the lengthy opening sequence shows how the remaining members of the scrappy Rebellion, led by General Leia (Carrie Fisher), are having to evacuate their base and flee from the fascistic First Order and its gnarled Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), who is mentor to Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), the son of Han Solo and Leia who turned to the Dark Side after Luke failed him in his Jedi training. Despite maverick pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) successfully leading an attack on the First Order’s most destructive ship, the losses are great and things are looking quite desperate. We then pick up with Luke, whose response to Rey’s grand gesture with the lightsaber is both surprising and one of the film’s first missteps; what he does makes sense, but the surprisingly comic manner in which he does it, which is clearly meant to humorously undercut two years of fan expectations, feels both dramatically out of sync and a bit glib. Rey is desperate to recruit Luke out of his self-imposed exile to help the Rebellion, but Luke, still disillusioned by his failure with Kylo Ren, refuses to engage her. He is clearly a damaged soul, so broken by the failures of the past that he has come to the conclusion that he should literally be the “last Jedi” of the title. Alas, Rey manages to break through enough of his hardened defenses—such the opposite of the wide-eyed, anxious farm boy we met back in 1977—that he agrees to train her. That training is disrupted when Luke discovers how powerful Rey can be and that she has a psychic connection with Kylo Ren that puts her in the same position that he held decades ago vis-à-vis Darth Vader—intent that he is not purely evil, but rather a conflicted soul who can be brought back from the Dark Side. Despite the Rey-Luke drama, the first half of The Last Jedi is its most lumbering and uneven, never really clicking as it rambles through its multiple plotlines in a manner that feels simultaneously rushed and overlong. This portion of the film is also saddled with a subplot involving Finn (John Boyega), the conscientious Storm Trooper-turned-Rebel hero who seemed all but dead at the end of The Force Awakens, and Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), a Rebel mechanic who first idolizes him and then joins him on the seemingly impossible mission of tracking down a master codebreaker to help them sneak onto one of the First Order’s ships and disable their tracking system.  However, about midway through the story we get a stunning sequence in which Rey, convinced that she can turn Kylo Ren from the Dark Side, allows herself to be captured by the First Order, which leads to Kylo taking her to face Snoke. At first it feels like little more than a riff on the climax of Return of the Jedi (1983) in which Luke squares off against the Emperor and Darth Vader, but Johnson has a number of twists up his sleeve that turn the sequence into a sustained and constantly surprising series of revelations that thrust the story into an entirely new direction. Unfolding in a massive throne room with red-lit walls lined with faceless scarlet guards (it looks like an experimental theater stage), this sequence is the film’s delirious high point, both emotionally and aesthetically. And everything that follows is almost as good, which helps the second half of The Last Jedi almost live up to the impossible expectations that have been heaped on it for the past two years.

"Dec 16, 2017",POSITIVE," Sometimes in an interview there’s a defining line. And in talking to Oscar Isaac about JC Chandor’s A MOST VIOLENT YEAR on December 5, 2014, it came towards the end our conversation, when I had asked what I called the “obligatory Star Wars question”.  As Isaac was describing his method for getting into character as an X-wing fighter in this most anticipated sequel, he described getting back to that unselfconscious playfulness he felt as a child.  It was, he opined, what all acting is about, even with such a serious role as Abel Morales in Chandor’s brilliant examination of ethics and corruption and the will to survive. Before getting to that, though, we covered how Isaac went about creating his character, a man with a carefully crafted facade and a fascinating sense of morality. From the nuances of dialogue in Spanish, to the particular way Abel dresses, to what Chandor did and didn’t choose to reveal to his actor. We also discussed how T-Bone Burnett‘s thoughts on music influenced the way he handled the silences in Chandor‘s script, and how his old friend, and co-star, Jessica Chastain, helped him land this role of a lifetime. A MOST VIOLENT YEAR is a film about ambition, optimism, and the American dream. Isaac plays Abel Morales, a self-made man whose plans to expand his New York City heating oil business in 1981 is being picked apart by a DA’s investigation, and a series of hijackings that cuts into his profits and breeds fear among his delivery men. With well-meaning but troubling advice coming from his wife and his lawyer, Abel struggles to keep everything he’s worked for from being taken from him while not violating his own personal sense of what it means to do the right thing, a sense that has everything to do with practicality, and not so much about ethics. The film co-stars Chastain, Albert Brooks, David Oyelowo, Alessandro Nivola, Elyes Gabel, and Catalina Sandino Moreno. It was written and directed by Chandor. Isaac’s accolades for this role have already won him the best actor award from the National Board of Review. His previous work includes playing a disturbingly hunky Joseph in THE NATIVITY STORY, Standard in DRIVE, and his Golden Globe-nominated performance in and as INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS. His future includes two franchises, with roles in X-MEN APOCALYPSE, and the much anticipated STAR WARS EPISODE VII: THE FORCE AWAKENS.

"Dec 16, 2017",POSITIVE," Picking up after The Force Awakens, General Leia (Carrie Fisher) is on the run with the Resistance after the super-weapon sneak attack by General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) and Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). While the First Order base was destroyed, it happened too late to prevent a shift in the balance of power. Leadership will be tested on both sides of the struggle, from the highest commander to the lowest mechanic. Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley) finally hands the galaxy’s most infamous light saber over to the island-bound Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in hopes of getting help for the Resistance and answers about the Force, specifically Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). But what’s with all the doe-eyed bleating penguin birds? Also: lots of things blow up. Fans on social media are threatening any who reveal the hyperspace secrets of this new Star Wars film, and while that’s a bit extreme, it calls attention to the masses new and old who love this fantasy space opera conceived by George Lucas. Now firmly entrenched at the House of Mouse next to Marvel Ent. and the recent acquisition of 21st Century Fox, the latest film has last year’s Rogue One to live up to. Has the success and sacrifice of that film influenced Episode XIII in all the best ways that matter, or will this be a step down onto a backwater junk planet to live out the rest of our days scraping by?

Admit it: you’ve already decided whether you’ll see this or not. It’s true there are echoes of The Empire Strikes Back here in the same way The Force Awakens called back A New Hope. Overarching themes of growing up have been infused with those of growing old and passing the torch, seasoned with some strained humor but also what we want to see — hey, filmmakers can be fans, too. But the best news is they take risks in the storytelling, and not just to keep us guessing; they’re genuinely setting a new expectation going forward… and that’s the point. Events fans dreamed of happening unfold differently than imagined, and that bit of reality highlights what’s really going on here: Star Wars is pushing out of its comfort zone. At two and a half hours, there are more than a few gaping plot holes you could drive a dreadnought through, mostly in terms of transition. Similar to the later seasons “Game of Thrones,” the time to get to anywhere in the galaxy has been reduced to a matter of will rather than parsecs, with heroes and villains where they need to be and when they need to be. Fortunately, there’s plenty of in-between banter, including more than few self-effacing moments. Viewers will be left to wonder if some things seen were done in pure silliness or a self-inflicted jab… or why not both? If the main intent was to be epic, The Last Jedi delivers, with plenty of cheer-worthy moments and a few plot-driven spectacles of imagery that leaves Episode VII visually in the dust: light saber battles, ground combat, and actual strategy employed in starship combat. When the veil of secrecy lifts and enough folks decide this can be talked about openly, expect there to be divisive discussion in this new turn for a galaxy far, far away — discussions already well underway on hidden social media threads labeled “spoilers.” About those Gooney Birds..
In John Houston’s famous WW2 documentary of the Japanese Attack on Wake Island the Gooney Birds are shown as part of the local for the Navy Aviators..
Not so strange when posted to far away outposts for a war.. That said, there has been some polarization over the idea that Episode VIII not only undermines the “happy ending” of Return of the Jedi but also paints the heroes as more than a little niave… which may not only be the point but a necessary plot point as well.  This sums up my take on on the small part of the fandom thinking The Last Jedi ruined Luke and the stories to date: it didn’t. "
"Dec 16, 2017",POSITIVE,Rian Johnson's spectacular expansion of George Lucas' galactic adventure franchise is everything you want it to be - and more. What a great holiday gift for moviegoers! May the Force Be With You...
"Dec 16, 2017",POSITIVE," At a point where the ever-extendable Star Wars franchise looked at risk of relying too much on its own legacy and table of cliches along comes The Last Jedi to push the saga into fresh, delightfully dangerous new territory that is enthralling in scope and compelling in nature as the tension between good and evil is brought to a mesmerising pitch. The eighth film in the series, The Last Jedi is easily one of the best, coming in a very close third after the original 1977 film and The Empire Strikes Back (1980), which stands as one of the best examples of how quality sequels respect the trust mass-audiences place in a movie brand. In those terms, The Last Jedi is damn-near its equal. This major refreshing of the franchise comes courtesy of little-known writer-director Rian Johnson (Brick; Looper) who has moved the story beyond the cartoonish action and narrative rehashing  we got with the previous two films. The Force Awaken (2015) – the first film of the third trilogy, taking place 30 years after the events in 1983’s Return of the Jedi – was essentially a suped-up carbon copy of the first film as the new-generation rebels, now known as The Resistance, fought off yet another Death Star, while Rogue One (2016) was a clumsy, borerline-silly prequel to the original film designed to explain how a single rebel fighter could destroy an entire Death Star. There’s none of that stumblebum storytelling in The Last Jedi, which (a few, well-judged gags aside) adopts the no-nonsense dramatic tone we saw in Empire and the underrated Revenge of the Sith (2005; the fouth-best Star Wars film after Last Jedi.) Taking place almost immediately after the events of Force Awakens we find the Resistance all-but-overwhelmed by the New Order (formerly known as the Imperial Forces, aka the Empire). Its fleet of megalithic ships – and, boy, do you sense their daunting size here! – have located the Resistance on a small planet and is chasing them down, essentially waiting for them to run out of fuel. Lead by Princess Leia – actually, it’s General Leia but somehow that doesn’t feel or sound right – her rag-tag army desperately try figuring out a way to survive what appears to be unavoidable doom. Complicating things is that Leia (played, of course, by Carrie Fisher in her final film role – and what a fitting coda it is to her chequered, sporadically brilliant career) is being chased down by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), the son she had with Han Solo, who Ren killed in the previous film, an act that gave the series one of its best moments. Ren answers to the all-powerful, incredibly ugly Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) who suspects that Ren’s submission to the Dark Side is still a few percentage points short of completion. He’d like to see total commitment from his protege. While this cat-and-mouse chase through space is going on, Rey (Daisy Ridley) is on a dramatically pointy island with aged Jedi Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) trying to get him to teach her the ways of The Force. He is reluctant to, but his motives go far beyond the curmudgeonly theatrics of Yoda in Empire – and this is where the story of The Last Jedi really upshifts into A-grade drama. Luke’s belief is that, while The Force is eternal, it might be time for the Jedi to die and be replaced by something better. Rey, desperate to be trained and get back into the fight, is mystified by this apparent defeatism. She also receives disturbing signs that Kylo Ren, merciless as he is, might be a candidate for redemption just like Luke and Leia’s father, Darth Vader, was. Thanks to very good performances and strong dialogue, Johnson grounds the story of The Last Jedi in a bedrock of themes about moral choice, the nature of defiance, self-sacrifice and spiritual renewal. Those looking for a religious interpretation might well find The Last Jedi one of the most Catholic films they’ll ever see. And it’s the drama that makes the film work as brilliantly as it does. The film contains some great twists and a clutch of magnificent moments that offer incredibly satisfying payoffs to tensions that have been meticulously built. While the film’s frenetic action is splendidly edited, Johnson and cinematographer Steve Yedlin have taken special care to occasionally allow your eyes to appreciate the visions they’ve conjured. By holding a shot for a precious extra two or three seconds you get to take in the beauty of a landscape, the complexity of a space battle, the destructive power of a death ray or the awesome scale of a giant space cruiser in all its photo-realistic glory. Sometimes the detail is so rich and vivid you’ll feel like you can reach out and touch them. Who needs 3D? Having now lost three – count them, three – Death Stars because of design flaws that allow a small band of rebels to infiltrate their defences, you would have thought by now that the New Order’s ship designers would take these very expensive lessons into account when designing its giant battle cruisers. Yet in The Last Jedi we again hear how the small size and speed of rebel ships are still a huge problem. This, regrettably, accounts for a rather weak opening action sequence where a gigantic ship is vulnerable to the fury of a tiny Resistance fighter. Things improve quickly after that as the Resistance’s encounters with the New Order become ever more costly and its chances of survival grow ever slimmer. So, given that and how good the rest of the film is, it’s an easy flaw to forgive, and it’d be great if we heard in the next film how the bad guys on big ships can now target small fighters with pin-point accuracy and blow them away. Finally, one of the truly wonderful things about The Last Jedi is its sheer unpredictability. Over and over, things are brought to a knife’s edge where you don’t know what the next moment will bring. And so it is with the film’s fabulous finale, which leaves you with little idea as to how the next film will proceed. One can only hope it will be as full of drama, action and surprises as The Last Jedi. Immediately after the premiere screening in Melbourne this evening, Jim joined Phil and Simon on Nightline to review the latest episode in the Star Wars saga."
"Dec 16, 2017",POSITIVE,"  The talented indie writer-director Rian Johnson (“Looper”/”Brick”) does an adequate job with this soap opera epic adventure story in space, in this 8th version of the Star Wars franchise. It should appeal to loyal Star Wars fans as it seeks their approval in all its calculated plot moves.  I’m no fan and found it to be only passable entertainment with superb visuals and an interesting reference to mind control made at one point of its story. But I was hindered by clunky dialogue, lack of dazzle and it being so rigidly programmed that it made the excellent cast seem stiffly led around as puppets for Lucas’s mythic agenda. Also its feel-good message of hope for the world in these dark times left me hardly feeling rosy about the future, that is, except for the future of the franchise. For what it’s worth, its nostalgia works well. Mark Hamill returns as Luke Skywalker and the late Carrie Fisher is again in her signature role of Leia Organa. Both give fine performances. There are also two new welcomed additions: the feisty rebel fighter Rose Tico played by Kelly Marie Tran and the CGI big-eyed gremlin-like figures called porgs. The main plot has the weakened Resistance fighters trying to survive and escape the powerful First Order baddies so they can fight another day. The First Order is led by its evil Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and its haughty Field General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), who are trying to destroy a damaged Resistance group headed by General Leia Organa. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is the reckless but dashing flyboy going it alone after Hux’s forces, when called back by General Leia for doing more harm than good. When Leia is injured command is turned over to the robotic Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern), whose decision-making is challenged by the volatile Poe. Meanwhile at a remote rocky island, the site of where the Jedi legacy began, at a secret hideout, the self-exiled Luke Skywalker is recruited by the female fighter Rey (Daisy Ridley), trying to harness her new Jedi powers as one of the new generation’s fighters. She calls on the recluse to come to the aid of Leia’s forces (the sequence of multiple Reys is innovative and is the most cherished moment of the film for me). Luke is still depressed in how he failed in his training with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and is still sulking over his miscalculations with him. Ren is the son of Han and Leia, Ben Solo, who killed his father. The conflicted baddie has changed his name and has sworn obedience to the Supreme Leader, as he tries his Darth Vader impression. When the dazed engineer Rose encounters the ex-Stormtrooper now proud rebel fighter, Finn (John Boyega), they join forces to find the code to break the tracker device used by the enemy to locate where the Resistance forces are located. To help them break the code they must rely on the unreliable genius thief DJ (Benicio del Toro), who is a master codebreaker. After some twists, it all leads to a lightsaber duel at the climax between Luke and Ren. The George Lucas space genre film started 40 years ago. This one is darker and more allegorical than the others, and matches up well with its better episodes. This bodes well for a franchise that shows no signs of dying now that it got back on track after its last success and overcoming the prior trio of bombs directed by Lucas. "
"Dec 16, 2017",POSITIVE," Dirigido e roteirizado por Rian Johnson. Com: Daisy Ridley, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, Lupita Nyong’o, Anthony Daniels, Gwendoline Christie, Kelly Marie Tran, Justin Theroux, Veronica Ngo, Warwick Davis, Benicio Del Toro e Laura Dern. Provocar o riso, despertar lágrimas e criar tensão não são tarefas fáceis para um realizador – e basta observar o imenso número de comédias, dramas e filmes de terror fracassados para constatar isso. No entanto, ainda mais difícil do que levar o espectador a experimentar estas sensações é causar-lhe arrepios, já que isto envolve fazê-lo reconhecer visceralmente momentos importantes não necessariamente pelo impacto que trazem à história, mas pelo que representam para os personagens e para aqueles que com estes se importam. Escrito pelo diretor Rian Johnson, o Episódio VIII da saga iniciada por George Lucas em 1977 retoma a trama a partir do instante em que a deixamos em O Despertar da Força, com a jovem Rey (Ridley) se encontrando com Luke Skywalker (Hamill) depois de atravessar a Galáxia para descobrir seu paradeiro. Enquanto isso, a Rebelião liderada pela General Leia (Fisher) busca resistir à Primeira Ordem comandada pelo Líder Supremo Snoke (Serkis), cujos principais subalternos são o General Hux (Gleeson) e, claro, Kylo Ren (Drive). Aos poucos, a narrativa se concentra também nas subtramas envolvendo personagens já conhecidos como Finn (Boyega) e o comandante Poe Dameron (Isaac), mas também novas figuras como a jovem Rose Tico (Tran) e a Vice-Almirante Holdo (Dern) – e se busco evitar ser específico com relação aos incidentes retratados pelo filme, é por reconhecer que, por mais que a paranoia envolvendo spoilers seja normalmente exagerada, aqui há várias reviravoltas que merecem ser descobertas por si próprias. Abrindo a projeção – como já virou tradição na série – in media res, atirando o espectador diretamente no meio da ação, Os Últimos Jedi é movido não só por grandes missões, mas (e principalmente) por várias pequenas jornadas que mantêm a narrativa se movendo enquanto cada personagem (ou grupo de personagens) se dedica a resolver seus problemas imediatos, lembrando, neste sentido, a estrutura de O Império Contra-Ataca, que também separava o protagonista dos companheiros e ficava saltando entre aquele e estes. E mesmo que o terço inicial deste Episódio VIII por vezes dê a impressão de estar apenas preparando o caminho para o capítulo final da nova trilogia, esta sensação se desfaz completamente quando um velho conhecido do público surge em cena e participa de uma conversa que, de certo modo, marca uma alteração na dinâmica e no ritmo de todo o longa, já que a partir daí as situações passam a se acelerar de maneira inquestionável. Além disso, é notável como, apesar do grande número de personagens, o roteiro encontra tempo para desenvolvê-los com eficiência, oferecendo também a cada um deles algum momento marcante que justifique sua inclusão na trama, permitindo, assim, que cada ato de sacrifício pessoal, grande ou pequeno, provoque impacto no espectador. Contando com um design de produção ainda mais ambicioso do que o do episódio anterior, Os Últimos Jedi expande o universo cinematográfico de forma magistral, desde a ilha-templo que serve de lar a Luke (e conta com longas escadarias de pedra, casebres rústicos mantidos por uma espécie antiga e cavernas com segredos próprios) até a câmara ocupada por Snoke e que, com um fundo infinito intensamente vermelho, poderia ter saído de um musical Technicolor de Powell e Pressburger, sendo complementando por uma guarda igualmente envolvida por aquela cor e cujas armaduras deixariam Kurosawa orgulhoso. Enquanto isso, o cassino que vemos em certo ponto traz versões inventivas de mesas e máquinas de jogos, além de seres de diversas espécies alienígenas com anatomias igualmente curiosas. Aliás, as criaturas aqui apresentadas encantam pela beleza (como os lobos de cristal) e/ou pelo visual que inspira “awwwws” em voz alta, destacando-se, entre estas, os já populares porgs - e confesso meu alívio ao constatar que estes são usados com economia por Rian Johnson, que evita torná-los novos Ewoks, retratando-os mais como pequenas praguinhas que divertem por sua natureza de infestação. O humor de Os Últimos Jedi, por sinal, é bastante eficiente, trazendo leveza para uma obra que, em sua essência, visa o público infanto-juvenil (e não entendo, portanto, as várias reclamações sobre os momentos de alívio cômico feitas por leitores nas redes sociais, já que esta é uma característica da franquia desde Uma Nova Esperança). Sim, as piadinhas podem ter falhado grosseiramente em A Ameaça Fantasma ou mesmo em diversos pontos de O Retorno de Jedi, mas aqui são eficazes na maior parte do tempo, desde gags físicas como aquela que traz BB-8 repetindo o número clássico dos furos na represa até a ação inesperada de Luke em seu primeiro encontro com Rey, que rompe com a seriedade (e com a solenidade) da situação ao mesmo tempo em que revela muito, sem necessidade de palavras, sobre sua posição acerca do mundo que deixou para trás. Além disso, Johnson chega a criar até mesmo uma gag visual que se resume basicamente a brincar com as expectativas do público acerca da tecnologia futurista da saga, incluindo um plano que parece revelar alguma nova e imponente nave apenas para expor um objeto bem mais prosaico – um tipo de piada que Star Wars nunca havia feito. Aliás, se algo realmente me surpreendeu positivamente em Os Últimos Jedi foi a disposição do realizador de se arriscar em pequenos recursos narrativos e floreios estéticos incomuns na série, o que faz jus à sua qualidade como artista – pois o fato é que Johnson é indubitavelmente o diretor mais talentoso a assumir qualquer capítulo do universo Star Wars até hoje (Lucas sempre foi um cineasta medíocre; Irvin Kershner, ainda que dirigindo o melhor episódio da saga, nunca foi um artista particularmente memorável; Richard Marquand teve uma carreira insignificante; Gareth Edwards é promissor, mas ainda inexperiente; e J.J. Abrams, embora competente, é melhor em recriar do que em criar). Assim, mesmo respeitando as convenções clássicas da série, como as cortinas de transição e a própria atmosfera da narrativa, Johnson se arrisca em jogos de montagem inéditos nos demais longas, como ao cortar rapidamente entre vários planos gerais e planos-detalhe para ilustrar o contato de Rey com a Força; ao alternar em fusões rapidíssimas entre Rey e Kylo Ren; ao empregar uma conversa da protagonista como narração de outra cena; e ao basicamente sugerir uma sequência de filme ambientado na Primeira Guerra ao mergulhar com a câmera na mão em trincheiras rebeldes. Mas Johnson e o diretor de fotografia Steve Yedlin também enriquecem a experiência através de jogos de luz interessantes: observem, por exemplo, como já no primeiro encontro de Rey e Luke o rosto deste se mantém semicoberto por sombras, ao passo que o da moça é fartamente iluminado pelo sol e notem, também, a beleza sugestivamente épica dos planos em contraluz que trazem a jovem Jedi praticando nas montanhas. De modo similar, os realizadores sabem que basta uma passagem rápida da sombra inconfundível da Millenium Falcon no chão para que apreciemos sua chegada – e mesmo a utilização de efeitos analógicos para movimentar determinadas figuras indica a inteligência do diretor, que sabe como isto despertará nostalgias particulares em seu público. Hábil ao criar momentos que já nascem icônicos na história da série, Johnson impressiona ao empregar em seus esforços recursos bastante diferentes uns dos outros: em certo instante, por exemplo, ele ressalta o impacto visual de uma batalha ao saltar para um plano geral, aéreo, que expõe rastros vermelhos no chão, ao passo que, em outro, o que causa choque é sua decisão de não incluir um elemento sonoro bombástico óbvio, substituindo-o pelo silêncio absoluto ao ilustrar os efeitos de uma ação destrutiva, mas nobre. Há, claro, outros efeitos mais tradicionais, mesmo que eficientes (como trazer um personagem saindo do meio da fumaça e caminhando em direção à câmera), mas estes são compensados por imagens que encantam por sua natureza fantástica – como aquela envolvendo Leia enquanto... bom, vocês reconhecerão o brilhante momento em questão quando surgir na tela. Carrie Fisher, diga-se de passagem, protagoniza muitos dos melhores momentos do filme, sendo uma tragédia que esta tenha sido sua performance final: elevando Leia a uma condição mítica que já merecia há muito tempo, Os Últimos Jedi ilustra a implacabilidade, as habilidades, mas também a humanidade da Princesa-convertida-em-General, que, mesmo ciente de ter obtido uma pequena vitória, por exemplo, não consegue deixar de lamentar a perda de tantas vidas no processo. Enquanto isso, Andy Serkis faz mais um belo trabalho como Snoke, que aqui tem mais oportunidades de exibir sua inteligência e seu imenso poder (um leve balançar com o dedo é capaz de arremessar um inimigo para longe), ao passo que Adam Driver investe na complexidade emocional de Kylo Ren, que, mesmo hesitando aqui e ali, sabe que suas chances de voltar atrás foram eliminadas no instante em que acionou o sabre de luz contra o corpo do pai. Já John Boyega segue exibindo carisma e timing cômico como Finn, aproveitando também para nos lembrar da valentia e dos princípios de seu improvável herói, ganhando uma boa parceira de cena em Kelly Marie Tran, cuja Rose Tico surge como uma figura que jamais permite que sua admiração pelo colega seja a característica que a definirá. Fechando o elenco secundário, Oscar Isaac usa a impetuosidade de Poe Dameron como ponto de partida para um pequeno arco dramático acerca da importância de reconhecer a valentia não apenas na ação impensada, mas também na estratégia. Porém, Os Últimos Jedi (o título em português, ao adotar o plural, contradiz o que o próprio diretor declarou ao seu respeito, mas...) tem, como centro, a relação entre Rey e Luke – e Mark Hamill encarna aqui a versão mais fascinante de seu personagem, adotando um ceticismo e uma amargura que servem como contraponto perfeito ao seu surpreendente senso de humor. Aliás, Hamill não desperdiça nenhuma das muitas oportunidades que recebe de criar passagens memoráveis – e, em certo momento no ato final, ele basicamente rouba o filme ao fazer um brevíssimo gesto com a mão esquerda que resume sozinho porque Luke virou lenda por toda a galáxia. Ainda assim, é Rey a protagonista indiscutível do longa, permitindo mais uma vez que Daisy Ridley demonstre por que se tornou instantaneamente em estrela em O Despertar da Força: sempre carismática e expressiva, a atriz é convincente tanto nas sequências de ação quanto naquelas em que testemunhamos os difíceis dilemas da personagem. Além disso, Os Últimos Jedi enriquece incrivelmente toda a saga (sim, em retrospecto, os efeitos se aplicam sobre todos os episódios anteriores) ao finalmente revelar – e agora devo alertar para que não leiam o restante deste texto caso ainda não tenham visto o filme – a verdade sobre os pais de Rey, separando o destino da Galáxia dos conflitos da família Skywalker e também descartando a ideia de que necessariamente a grande intensidade da Força na personagem implicaria em uma ligação inevitável com Anakin e seus descendentes. Esta origem comum – mais: miserável, cercada pela pobreza e pelo desespero de pais sem um centavo no bolso ou um lugar no Universo – cria também uma rima elegante com Uma Nova Esperança, quando o destino da Galáxia ao menos parecia estar nas mãos de um jovem “camponês” órfão. Neste sentido, é interessante constatar como Os Últimos Jedi segue a tradição de Star Wars de atuar como alegorias políticas – e que tantos fãs da série pareçam (ou queiram) ignorar as implicações temáticas da criação de George Lucas é algo que considero espantoso. Aliás, há, neste Episódio VIII, toda uma sequência que sequer tenta ser sutil ao retratar a elite econômica como uma classe composta por sociopatas que não hesitam em explorar e destruir a Natureza por puro entretenimento, empregando também o trabalho infantil sem qualquer remorso enquanto protesta diante de qualquer coisa que considere como invasão de seu espaço (com direito a praia particular e tudo mais). Mais do que isso: através do personagem de Benicio Del Toro, o roteiro denuncia como a busca desenfreada pelo lucro supera qualquer tipo de moralidade mais básica, o que, associado à estupidez da guerra, abandona o homem comum à própria sorte, atirado entre forças muito maiores do que ele e que o empregam apenas como peão de um jogo cujos resultados – sejam lá quais forem – o terão como derrotado. Mas talvez o que mais me encante em Os Últimos Jedi seja a beleza (e é a terceira vez que uso esta palavra neste texto) da estrutura dos arcos de Luke e Kylo Ren, que funcionam como reflexo um do outro, o que inclui a eventual inversão de suas trajetórias: se a princípio Luke quer destruir o passado enquanto Ben Solo quer revivê-lo, tornando-se um novo Darth Vader, aos poucos os personagens vão se aproximando um do outro e novamente se afastando, concluindo suas jornadas mais uma vez em polos opostos, com o jovem determinado a exterminar todo o passado e Luke convencido de que o futuro envolve o ressurgimento daquilo que queria ver finalizado. E, assim, é mais do que apropriado que o velho mestre Jedi jamais conclua o treinamento de Rey e exponha qual seria a última das três lições que havia prometido – afinal, é esta incompletude inevitável, esta ruptura de jornadas presumidamente pré-estabelecidas e de relações de afeto, que resume sua própria vida e a daqueles que, como Rey, sabem que o caminho do Herói é repleto de amores perdidos, de promessas de felicidade não realizadas e de sacrifícios pessoais que, mesmo na vitória, consomem completamente aqueles que se viram obrigados a fazê-los."
"Dec 16, 2017",POSITIVE," The primary objective of Star Wars: The Force Awakens was to restore faith in the franchise (and the galaxy) after the cringeworthy prequel trilogy. With his piety to the original series, J.J. Abrams' ability to accomplish that mission in 2015 came at the cost of creativity. Nonetheless, his reparative efforts, further bolstered by 2016's Rogue One, have afforded filmmaker Rian Johnson (Looper) more breathing room for the latest installation. Not without flaws, Johnson takes familiar elements from the series and breathes new life into them with clever spins in The Last Jedi. General Leia Organa, whose war-weariness is effectively conveyed by the late Carrie Fisher, is leading an evacuation of the Resistance, with the First Order—whose melodramatic characters, such as Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie), are overplayed with antiquated villainy—in close pursuit. Meanwhile on the ocean planet Ahch-To, Rey (Daisy Ridley) is seeking to learn the ways of the Force from the hermetic Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who rejects her pleas to help the Resistance. As Rey's Jedi abilities emerge, she also develops an unusual psychic connection with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) that takes them both by surprise. Rey, Finn, and Poe may be destined to remain pale echoes of the Holy Triumvirate of Leia, Luke, and Han, but here, they show signs of breaking away from the generic blandness that inhibited their introductions in The Force Awakens. Joining them this time around are sincere-hearted mechanic Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) and the strong-willed Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern), who both up-end expectations. Weak points come with awkward humour that lacks comedic rhythm and an unnecessary casino escapade, where a disposable underworld character DJ (Benicio del Toro) is introduced, that subsequently soft lens into what is essentially a children's adventure tale about animals. (Speaking of which, the numerous new alien critters in the background, such as the birdlike Porgs, go too much for the cutesy and still appear more like animation-meets-live-action rather than real beings, as they lack the presence of physically made constructions used for creatures in the original trilogy.) Much of this extraneous action is merely means to delay narrative advancement as Rey contends with her internal struggle of trying to figure out her relationship with the Force, Kylo Ren, the Dark Side, and the identity of her mysterious parents. Once most of that's dealt with, the plot is finally freed for lift-off—which it does with spirited action and striking art direction that possesses a freshness in its approach. What serves filmmaker Johnson well is his willingness to take more risks within classic elements than Abrams may have been able to. The real measure of the success of a film in a franchise of this stature is whether or not it ignites the imagination—and, despite some patchy spots, that it does. The urban beastie otherwise known as Craig Takeuchi is a UBC BA (art history/film studies) and MFA (Creative Writing program, with a screenplay thesis) graduate who has had his fiction and non-fiction work published in numerous local and national publications. He's covered a wide range of topics..."
"Dec 16, 2017",POSITIVE," Like most recent exercises in pop nostalgia, the new Star Wars films have an underlying melancholy. It's not just because Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and friends have aged with the rest of us, but because today's Hollywood so rarely manages to devise brand-new stories with the same breadth of appeal. While The Last Jedi may not receive top marks for originality, the eighth official entry in the Star Wars saga is still one of the most entertaining blockbusters of the year, justifying the faith the Disney corporation have shown in writer-director Rian Johnson (Looper). Johnson has a subversive streak, but also the knack of gratifying an audience through a stream of small surprises. He delivers nearly everything a Star Wars fan might want, though not always in the expected ways: there are the requisite aerial battles and light sabre duels, and a winning range of new aliens, from sleek snow foxes to the already-legendary porgs, who look like upright guinea pigs with large pleading eyes. As a technician, he owes less to series creator George Lucas than to Lucas' old comrade Steven Spielberg. Like Spielberg, he makes the camera part of the action, tracking in rapidly for emphasis and zipping from one significant detail to another. As in The Empire Strikes Back - the Star Wars film Johnson most obviously takes as a model - the complex plot branches off in multiple directions. While the cocky fighter pilot Poe Dameron​ (Oscar Isaac) butts heads over strategy with the new Resistance leader Admiral Holdo​ (Laura Dern​), former stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega​) and his new pal Rose (Kelly Marie Tran​) embark on their own far-fetched plan for saving the Resistance fleet.  Most central is the long-delayed encounter between Luke, now living as a hermit, and the young heroine Rey (Daisy Ridley), who sees herself as his potential successor. Not far from the surface are Johnson's own anxieties about stepping into Lucas' shoes, yet he can boast certain talents Lucas has always lacked, including a flair for language (one bit player is characteristically described as ""a poet with a blaster"") and a rapport with actors which yields more good performances than most previous Star Wars films put together. There isn't as much of the late Carrie Fisher's General Organa (otherwise known as Princess Leia) as might be hoped. But her big moments are worth waiting for, especially her scenes with Dern, who plays the lilac-haired Admiral Holdo as a typical Dern character, full of fretful good intentions but with steel beneath. Even Adam Driver, as the tortured young villain Kylo Ren, makes more sense here than previously: everyone in the Star Wars family has a niche, and it's clear by now that Driver's niche is weird, vaguely misplaced intensity, just as Ridley's is dauntless pluck. Unavoidably, the innocence of earlier Star Wars instalments is long gone. Johnson can't help mocking the cliches Lucas played straight, even as he strains to deepen characters originally conceived as cardboard types. Where Lucas was content to delight the first Star Wars audiences with a simple tale of derring-do, Johnson has to wrestle with the complex legacy of one of the most popular and influential film series ever made; the encounter between Luke and Rey offers an explicit commentary on which aspects of this legacy should be preserved and which left behind. That Johnson has signed on for three more Star Wars movies is not wholly good news for fans of his original work as writer-director, and Johnson  seems to have some ambivalence, repeatedly acknowledging the possibility that it may be time to move on from the Jedi and the Force. Perhaps he has accepted the burden out of civic duty, feeling that no one can now afford to turn down the chance to deliver a positive message to an audience of millions. At any rate, it's no bad thing that the cleverness which goes into his battle sequences is also used to imply there might be more to heroism than blowing things up."
"Dec 16, 2017",POSITIVE," Here in a nutshell is all you need to know about “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,”  which officially opens on Dec. 15 but with early shows on Thursday (many of which are sold out) — and there is nothing revealed about what actually happens in the film. First, Leia has a substantial part in the story, and it serves as a fitting final screen role for Carrie Fisher, who died unexpectedly this year. Two, porgs are not the new Jar Jar Binks, but they might end up the new Ewoks (OK, this might have been something only I was concerned about, but ever since “The Phantom Menace,” there is always the danger of the Jar Jar Factor”). Three, director Rian Johnson respects the “Star Wars” universe that George Lucas created in the original trilogy and gives us a film that reminds us why we fell in love with those films in the first place. His tone acknowledges how we both revere those films and want to have fun with them. But he knows where to draw the line — at the prequels — and without directly referencing any of those films he squarely rejects the ridiculous notion of midi-chlorians (those things in a person’s cells that allows them to connect to the Force) and returns to the more spiritual definition Obi Wan served up in the first film about it being “an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us; it binds the galaxy together."" Basically, “The Last Jedi” sets everything in the “Star Wars” universe right. So if all you want to know is can you go in expecting a good film, the answer is yes. A resounding yes! I was 17 when “Star Wars” — it was not “A New Hope” or “Episode IV” back then, and to me, it will forever simply be “Star Wars” — opened on May 25, 1977 at the Valley Circle Theater in Mission Valley. I waited in line. I saw it four times in one day. I even joined the fan club that snail mailed Bantha Tracks newsletter every month.  I loved the film. As someone whose father had raised me on Errol Flynn swashbucklers and James Bond action films along with a healthy dose of creature features and science fiction, I was primed for “Star Wars” when it opened. Here’s what was so appealing: It had a Saturday morning serial sense of fun and adventure but without a jokey wink-wink, nudge-nudge sense of mockery. It was utterly sincere. It appealed to us because we felt like anyone could rise to become a hero in a rebellion against evil; that a princess could kick ass and do her own rescuing; that a scoundrel could reject his sense of greed and self-preservation and find moral fiber; and it had a delicious villain in Darth Vader. George Lucas gave us all that … then he tried to take it all away with his prequels and re-edited special editions of the original trilogy. The original trilogy was about farm boys becoming heroes in a rebellion. It was about being on the side of right and fighting for the basic human right of being free of the evil Empire. It was about a love for the tropes and formula of cinema. The prequels, on the other hand, were about trade agreements, midi-chlorians, in-your-face offensive characters like Jar Jar Binks (who just would not go away), special effects technology over characters, and about making a product to market. Ugh. When the prequels came out I tried to convince myself they were not bad (I could not even pretend to make the argument that they were good, but I could pretend they weren’t that bad). But they were bad. I could barely bring myself to seeing them more than once, whereas I watch “Star Wars” and “Empire Strikes Back” multiple times every year. It was the Dark Times, and I had to manage a love-hate relationship with Lucas.  Then we got J.J. Abrams’ “The Force Awakens,” which I refer to as The Healing Film. It wasn’t a great film, but for the first time in years, we had a “Star Wars” film that did not suck — hallelujah! It was a safe film. It wanted to give fans a film they could embrace and it succeeded. But it felt too familiar, and it lacked true passion. It was the film fans needed to feel good about the franchise. And it was glorious to get the gang back together and reminisce about old times. It was a film on par with “Return of the Jedi.” Decidely better than any prequel but nowhere near as great as “Star Wars” or “Empire.” Then came Gareth Edwards’ “Rogue One.” Wow! That was a real fan film from a guy who went to Tunisa to drink blue milk on the old location of Uncle Owen’s moisture farm. “Rogue One” was this new thing, a stand-alone anthology film that played into the “Star Wars” universe but which was not part of any of the trilogies. It was great. The action was better and a little grittier. We got to see a character like Vader from a slightly new angle, and we had a new ragtag band of rebel fighters to inspire us.  Now “The Last Jedi” comes along. It is on par with “Rogue One” for its craft and execution. It perfectly plays into the “Star Wars” universe but with Johnson investing the familiar formula with his own passion and affection for the franchise. But “The Last Jedi” also does something else: it puts the “Star Wars” mythology back on track with what we latched onto in that first film. As with “Rogue One,” “The Last Jedi” suggests that rebellions can have a high cost in terms of human lives. Fighting a powerful Empire or the First Order requires a lot of sacrifice and both films show that cost. But “The Last Jedi” gets to play more directly into the storyline we have been following for decades. We get to see Leia mature into an even stronger leader. We get to see older female characters in strong leadership roles following on what Lucas laid out in the first films (remember, in addition to Leia we had Mon Mothma leading the Rebel Alliance).  Johnson, who also wrote the script, plays out the twists and turns in a clever fashion so that the film answers some questions while raising others. But the most important thing is that he builds on the mythology of “Star Wars” in a satisfying manner. He gives us heroes who don’t want to be symbols for the rebellion but who come to terms with that fame and the important role it can play in inspiring others. He also shows us different kinds of heroes, some of whom remain hidden. He delivers a message about how we must fight oppression and that sometimes, as James Stewart so eloquently put it in “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,” sometimes lost causes are the only ones worth fighting for, and you fight harder for them. So this is also an appealing David-versus-Goliath tale in which the smaller, less equipped rebel forces take on the mammoth, well-financed and armed First Order.  “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” (rated PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi action and violence) is a most welcome addition to the “Star Wars” universe. It delivers on action, character, nostalgia, production design and thematic development. I got chills when the theme first starts to play and the scroll begin. I got goose bumps at the first sound of TIE fighters entering the frame. It’s a film I left feeling, “Yes, that’s exactly where the story needs to be going.” I can’t think of a better cinematic Christmas gift than a stellar “Star Wars” film. Thank you, Rian Johnson, for making this “Star Wars” fan’s holiday wish come true."
"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE,Star Wars: The Last Jedi successfully combines the thrill-a-minute fun that's always been part of the saga with a fresh spin on the light/dark theme embedded into the epic tale's DNA.
"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE," Star Wars is a franchise of the past. George Lucas's original 1977 blockbuster threw back to B-movie sci-fi pictures and Flash Gordon serials. The sequels realized that Luke Skywalker's answer to the Empire wasn't an immediate, violent action, but a passive defense bolstered by ancient Jedi mysticism and the universe-uniting energy known as The Force. Sixteen years after the original trilogy, Lucas returned to Star Wars with three prequels chronicling the life and times of pre-Darth-Vader Anakin Skywalker. Even when the series pushed into the future with Episode VII - The Force Awakens, the story tethered new characters to old favorites while echoing the familiar beats of the '77 movie, playing more like a soft reboot than a straight sequel. For 40 years, the joys of Star Wars have come from the comfort of hindsight, the familiarity of mythology, and the known unknowns. The departure is polarizing fans in ways that haven't been seen since the original reviews for The Empire Strikes Back in 1980. Rotten Tomatoes finds a stark divide between critics (93%) and general audiences (60%), with social media reactions ranging from the glowing to the harsh. Will LucasFilm ever deliver this sect of Star Wars fandom another installment it'll actually enjoy? Not even a Force Vision could predict that. But with every super-spoilable turn,The Last Jedi anticipates backlash, and asks longtime devotees to look inward. Episode VIII picks up shortly after The Force Awakens, though the tectonic plates of the universe have shifted. Despite victory in the attack on Starkiller Base, The Resistance is on the run from an incoming First Order fleet that has discovered their hideout; on Ahch-To, Rey hands off Anakin's blue lightsaber to Luke, who stubbornly tosses it over his shoulder and brushes off his inevitable pupil; sensing conflict in his heart, Supreme Leader Snoke reprimands Kylo Ren, who hopes to impress his decaying boss by killing his mother in aerial combat. The stakes are high, but unlike The Force Awakens, where our heroes found answers in the past -- and J.J. Abrams promised more to come through lingering mystery -- the legacies of the Dark and Light, the battles between the Empire and the Rebels, weigh down on the shoulders of the characters instead of providing clear answers. Good, bad, or somewhere in-between, the main players all seem to agree that the only way out of this mess is to abandon everything they knew and start anew. Early on in the film, Kylo Ren sheds his Vader-esque mask after taking flack from Snoke. No longer is he a perturbed cosplayer who kneels at the altar of Star Wars collectibles (yes, he shelled out for Vader's actual burnt helmet, at some point). Scarred from battle and piercing from his misguided training under Luke, Kylo is more Ben Solo, his birth persona, than ever before. And he's pissed. Before John Williams' fanfare blasts over the end credits, our villain will reach out to Rey for understanding, murder Snoke in a swift act of ""Et tu, Brute?"" lightsaber-slinging, and beg his fellow Force-wielder to abandon the idea of the Resistance or The First Order. ""It's time to let old things die,"" he says. ""Snoke, Skywalker, The Sith, Rebels - Let it all die, Rey. I want you to join me. We can rule together and bring a new order to the galaxy."" Rey declines, but the point sticks: the old world order is dissolving. She knows this to be true. After begging Luke Skywalker for his assistance in taking down the First Order, and wearing him down enough to earn traditional Jedi training, the heroine unravels the mystery behind Luke and Ben Ren's imploded relationship. Like in Rashomon, the whole truth plays out from multiple vantage points and reveals itself to be a messy affair. Luke contemplated murdering Ben, retracted his lightsaber blade just before slicing the Sith turncoat's neck, yet still managed to prove Ben's suspicions of the Jedi right by being in the wrong place at the wrong time, leading to the destructive outburst Rey first saw in The Force Awakens hallucinatory flashbacks. The real-life Jedi master she thought she knew from storybooks was in fact a knotted mess of failure and regret. Like so many fan-convention-goers, Rey learns that your heroes don't always turn out to be so heroic in real life. That seems to a cause of the agita for Star Wars fans, who expected an aging Luke to be clear-minded and all-knowing. But in The Last Jedi, he still finds room to grow, forever a Jedi in training -- or transcending. In reverse of the Jedi trilogy, it's Luke's fate to dismantle the Jedi Order into a new state of faith-based thinking. As a ""religion,"" the ways of the Force can radicalize the young, and in turn, cripple their teachers. But with Rey as a pupil, Luke redefines ""balance"" for himself.  ""That Force does not belong to the Jedi,"" he tells her. ""To say that the Jedi die that the light dies is vanity."" Luke Skywalker doesn't even believe in ""Luke Skywalker"" anymore, and Yoda appears before him to insist this complication is what makes him and all future Jedi valuable to the world. ""The greatest teacher, failure is. Luke, we are what they grow beyond. That is the burden of all true masters."" Writer-director Rian Johnson (Looper) speaks to the fans with The Last Jedi. As religions and political landscapes have evolved in the forty years since George Lucas's Star Wars, so have the in-world exploits of the franchise and the series' meta-commentary. People who've dedicated their lives to Star Wars, enchanted by the moral goal posts and Campbellian gear-turning of the original trilogy, risk becoming the Snokes of their own microcosm. And while the Supreme Leader ends his journey in the same ambiguity as he entered -- a thrilling repudiation to Abrams' mystery box practices that have all but dominated Reddit for the past 10 years -- we do know he can't outwit Kylo Ren, who, even while on a violent streak, believes there's a better way to lord over the galaxy than with an Emperor 2.0. He envisions a different kind of Star Wars.  Poe Dameron's entire arc leans in to the read: the Han-Solo successor from Force Awakens finds himself out of place in the military strategy of The Last Jedi, where hotshot pilot behavior stands a better chance of getting everyone killed then saving the day in a last-second countdown. Finn and Rose's entire subplot is a bust (only plot-wise -- a glimpse of Canto Bright and Benicio del Toro's archetype-cracking smuggler more than make up for the duo's detour), but in the end, Poe learns to stop mansplaining his female superiors and trust a plan, however bleak. The subtext to the most damning Last Jedi tweets seems to be there's a right way to Star Wars and a wrong way to Star Wars. Like, Poe, the movie suggests, we could all stand to trust the judgment of those tasked to save the day (and deliver a damn fine blockbuster). ""The Rebellion is reborn today,"" Luke tells Kylo Ren in their astrally projected showdown. And with The Last Jedi, so is Star Wars. The movie isn't perfect, but a slog of a first hour makes way for striking compositions, the most exhilarating saber battles in the series' history, and for the first time, unknown unknowns. Luke, having exerted his life force and faded into the stars, hands the mantle of ""the last Jedi"" to Rey, who won't be the last. The final shots of the movie offers a glimpses of new hopes: an inclusive Rebellion, a fight in the hands of the next generation, and warriors yet to be found. If hardcore Star Wars fans open up their beloved franchise to same expansion, they too might find their ""Broom Kid"" (who deserves his own trilogy, frankly). Luke's has a few more parting words for Kylo Ren before dissipating back to Ach-to: ""Strike me down in anger and I'll always be with you."" So you hate The Last Jedi because it isn't like the other Star Wars movies. That's fine. But the direction has changed, and while Rey is holding on to the Jedi scripture for the time being, the future looks irrevocably different. J.J. Abrams will wrap the sequel trilogy in 2019, working off the precedence set by The Last Jedi. And in the years to come, Johnson will break out with his own trilogy, detached from the Rey storyline and set in a new part of the galaxy. What ""is"" Star Wars? For the first time, we have no idea, and it's a thrill."
"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE," This delightful if overlong film has so many arcs and subplots that you'll find yourself parsing them later, trying to work out what exactly happened and why — not because they don't work, but because the film packs so many scenes that reward closer-than-normal observation. (Rewatch the red dirt battles and you'll see what I mean.) If certain moments are permitted to remain evocative and surreal rather than purely expository — for those who've seen the film, I'm thinking of the ice-mirror particularly — the movie also takes up the problem of history: A major plot point revolves around the way two different characters narrate the same incident. The difference between their accounts translates to war. That's exactly as correct as it is tragic. What's more, the relationship defined by that difference acquires 100 times more depth than the Han-Ben dynamic, which remains the emptiest cipher of a relationship I've yet to see onscreen. The Last Jedi begins where The Force Awakens leaves off: The First Order is gaining strength, the Resistance is on the run, Snoke is pulling Ben Solo/Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) further into his orbit, and Rey (Daisy Ridley) is on Luke Skywalker's island, trying to convince him to help. Mark Hamill has never been better than he is in this film; his dismissals of Rey are genuinely funny and set the stage for grander, even more epic put-downs. The wonderful Carrie Fisher's Rebel General Leia Organa has a lot more to do, both literally and dramatically, than she did in the previous film; and The Last Jedi introduces Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern), who quite rightly calls Poe (Oscar Isaac) a ""trigger-happy flyboy."" As for John Boyega's Finn, he's recovering, and eventually meets Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), a kind but tough-minded mechanic and one of my favorite additions to the franchise. I'm on the record as considering The Force Awakens to be a pretty poor piece of filmmaking. It explodes many of the franchise's worst tendencies; in particular, it hit the upper limit of the franchise's fetish for the Skywalker ""lineage"" and melodramatic father-and-son twaddle while at the same time making the destruction of nine planets a fairly minor plot point. I was impressed and moved by how successfully Rogue One evaded these tired devices and fixed the former's miscalibrated stakes. I've longed for a Star Wars that really saw some of the ""regular"" people in its rich and varied worlds, and Rogue One did. To my surprise, The Last Jedi does too. For one thing, Poe — who functioned as a charismatic catalyst and principle of action in the first film — keeps trying to do the same here and failing. His initiatives are entertaining but inessential, and it's refreshing to see the slapdash plans that so often powered the franchise occasionally fail to work. He can't wrest narrative centrality from either the universe or the Resistance, and the way that point is made explicit is particularly elegant. That said, The Last Jedi recognizes that fame is part of its universe now: If the Resistance is to spread, its heroic stories must be told. That the subjects don't quite match their legends shows that they're fun, self-aware, and human. Rose first identifies Finn as a hero; it's not a label he particularly wants, and it isn't one that lasts. This is of a piece with The Last Jedi's willingness to part with some of its more messianic overtones — which is surprising, given its title! Take Kylo. It seemed to me for a long and horrifying moment that The Force Awakens was getting too interested — as the Star Wars prequels did — in the villain's redemption story. Little could be duller than flashbacks to Kylo Ren's descent into darkness, so I'm delighted to announce, spoilers be damned, that the movie resists. And it's not exactly Star Wars' fault that so many of its twists have had to do with parentage — ""Luke, I am your father"" remains the franchise's most famous misquotation — but it's still a relief when The Last Jedi relaxes that explanatory stranglehold just a tad. One result is that many more characters get to breathe without having to cite their exact degree of separation from the precious Skywalker blood. (I exclude the porgs, who are clearly Skywalkers and quite believable as teensy web-toed Jedis.) Another of this film's less expected pleasures is its rollicking irreverence toward Jedi prudence. Not once, but twice, a Jedi contemplates doing something that would have major consequences, hesitates, and then someone pops in and does it anyway. It's an amusing intervention that works well both times and neutralizes any hope of Jedi omniscience. Notable, too, is the extent to which female fighters are included and treated with the same desperate respect as the men: Two of the film's most effective suicide-warriors are female, and it's embarrassing to explain why someone who generally opposes celebrations of violence finds that moving, but here we are. This movie takes death seriously, and that matters to me. The Force Awakens was an irresponsible joyride that entranced you in the moment and broke into pieces the minute it was over and you started thinking about it. What I most appreciate about The Last Jedi is the care that seems to have gone into everything, from its deaths to its visual effects. Remember when Snoke was a projection — prompting questions about what his actual size might be? The Last Jedi has no time for that foolishness; it clears the matter up. Only when you think about it later do the obvious structural reasons for that change become clear. Plus, it's just beautiful. The action sequences are gorgeous. The destruction of a casino is an absolute dream. There are even — maybe for the first time in any Star Wars movie? — books! In the trailer, Luke says ""this is not going to go the way you think."" He's right. And after The Force Awakens, which rehashed A New Hope almost beat for beat — that injection of fresh story into an old franchise (and recalibration of its mouldier priorities) is immensely welcome.

critic's rating: 



3.0/5

A strong finale can make even the most mediocre story seem like an epic. Rian Johnson's Star Wars entry isn't quite the dud, it is in all fairness a better offering than JJ Abrams' franchise reviving The Force Awakens. But its initial hour and half is nothing special. There's an unabashed attempt to build things up, there's plenty of logic defying writing on offer. But in the end, in an ultra cool twist of greatness, The Last Jedi serves up enough spunk and thrills to become one of the franchise's most memorable entries. The climactic 30-40 minutes are phenomenal. They're certainly good enough to overshadow the loopholes and shortcomings of the rest of the film. The story picks up exactly where The Force Awakens left it off. Once the opening crawl fills you in on the galaxy's latest political ordeal, the story instantaneously picks up with Rey (Daisy Ridley) as she reaches out to Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Meanwhile the Resistance and the First Order are lodged in a spaceship battle duel in what's essentially a cat and mouse game in outer space. As the quintessential chase takes place, what with General Hux (Domnhall Gleeson) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) in hot pursuit of Princess Leia’s (Carrie Fisher) resistance ships, Rey tries to convince Luke to join the battle while Finn (John Boyega) and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) set off on a Rogue One type mission. For most part of the runtime, The Last Jedi's story just seems like a new derivative of George Lucas' original A New Hope. The developments and plot devices seem so familiar that you constantly recall moments from Lucas' first three films. Yoda training young Luke in The Empire Strikes Back, Han Solo's reckless heroics and Princess Leia's never-ending hope all have a mirror in Johnson's film. The sense of familiarity and the heavy usage of build-up, makes things a little tedious and tiresome during the initial stages. But once the final resolutions arrive, The Last Jedi really kicks into overdrive.In the final minutes, the film delivers one stunning setpiece after the other. The character of Kylo Ren, the main antagonist, who's really filling into the shoes of Darth Vader, finds his feet during these final moments. So does Rey, who essentially is the successor to Luke in the Star Wars saga. These passing of the baton moments are the strength of the film. The island where Luke has taken refuge is as surreal in its details as the planet Dagobah where he first met Yoda. There are weird and interesting new alien creatures as if straight out of a Terry Gilliam movie. These details and the ability of the movie to constantly make references to previous Star Wars films makes The Last Jedi a solid watch.The performances are the biggest surprise. Adam Driver and Mark Hamill give standout performances. Driver was one of the weakest links in The Force Awakens but here, his character gets the right shades and the actor does justice to every hue. Hamill brings a wealth of rhetoric. He's the voice of reason, constantly picking holes in the Star Wars legends and saga. But once he turns to heroics, Johnson and his team of writers give him a super platform. He truly becomes one of the greatest heroes in science fiction franchise, tongue firmly in cheek. There's also one more great moment in the film featuring Daisy Ridley and her first tryst with the dark side, that's just a superb experience.With The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson's done to the Star Wars franchise what Joss Whedon had done for Marvel with The Avengers. Disney and Lucasfilm have another solid franchise base in the offing now. The Star Wars legacy is back. The Rogue One effect has kicked in, The Last Jedi is the film the world should be watching this weekend.

"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE," In 1977, America needed Darth Vader—a cold killing machine, with the black-leather-glove grip of invisible doom at the tip of his fingers. In the aftermath of the morally confounding Vietnam War, in a culture dominated by piffle like The Love Boat and Rod Stewart, the heavy breath and purposeful stride of Vader sliced through like a scythe. Here was death incarnate wielding a sword made of fire ready to strike down all the good in the world, most especially a farm boy from the outer reaches (like Jimmy Carter). The message was simple: Be afraid. This, of course, was the genius of the character and one of the great inventions of Abrams’s movie, which was criticized as a repackaging of the original film’s best ideas. There were other innovations: Rey, a woman strong with the Force and in the cockpit, was a necessary update to the series’ power dynamic. Finn was a subversion of the (white) Stormtrooper mythos. Poe Dameron was a Han Solo for the Internet Boyfriend generation. But Kylo Ren was a real boyfriend, a lousy one, always grousing about work (ugh, General Hux) and his parents, falsely idolizing his angry dead grandfather, and never getting around to asking you about your day. We are drawn to him and yet he is pitiful. A perfect millennial man. A rebel-killer without a cause. That this shit-hearted brute is portrayed by Driver, then best known to the world as Adam, Hannah’s on-again-off-again boyfriend on HBO’s Girls, made the character doubly poetic. Driver’s clambering gait and shaved-ape bearing gave Kylo Ren a quality of being not-quite-evolved, as if he hadn’t finished growing into his cowl and mask. When a rebel group evades his grasp, he throws a lightsaber temper tantrum that would make Darth Vader wince. Stormtroopers don’t fear him so much as try desperately to avoid talking to him.  Throughout The Force Awakens, Kylo Ren take a star tour across pop psychology’s greatest hits: He mocks the graceful heartthrob Dameron like a nerd turning the tides on the high school quarterback; he mewls at his mentor, the shadowy Snoke, desperate for his approval but unyielding in his arrogance; and in an Oedipal twist, he murders his own father, a show of faith to the dark side and also real stakes in the film.  Buttressed by Snoke and the peevish bureaucrat General Hux (a vampiric, delightful Domhnall Gleeson), Kylo Ren is a rare creation: unfinished evil. When he finally faces down the omega to his alpha in the final showdown with Rey, he fights through a wound he’s suffered by bashing it with his own fist, as if pain could stem pain. He’s a child, a brat trying to be a man. Rey wins, and the two are divided by a chasm in an exploding satellite, the two poles of this story widening just as they were finally getting close. That final battle is the best scene in Abrams’s movie, not least because of that striking image when Rey calls Luke Skywalker’s lightsaber to her hand with the Force and illuminates her face with that blue laser. By movie’s end, it’s clear that Daisy Ridley will animate the future of Star Wars, but Adam Driver—sweating and simpering his way through defeat—will be the worthy adversary, wounded and maddened by everything that opposes him.  The big-top movie franchises, upon which so much of the scaffolding of the film industry is hanging, have one big problem: The villains suck. Let’s have a quiz. Quickly: What was the name of the villain in Doctor Strange? What about in The Hobbit? How about Justice League, which was released just one month ago? The answer: It doesn’t matter. These characters (Kaecilius, Azog, and Steppenwolf, for the record) make their films feel disposable, like links on a chain tied to an anvil at the bottom of the ocean. Keep following their stories, tracking their continuity, and eventually you’ll drown. In fact, the studios are counting on it. This is not a new problem. For nearly 60 years, James Bond films have subsisted on a rotisserie of malevolent evil geniuses questing to conquer the world because … well, because they want to. Likewise the mythical monsters of J.R.R. Tolkien or Transformers or the villains in The Fast and the Furious series or Mission: Impossible films. What do these villains want? Gold? Power? To take back what they believe to be rightfully theirs? Perhaps. We never really find out. Marvel’s Thanos, billed as the big bad of next summer’s Avengers: Infinity War, is a cosmic warlord affectionately referred to as the Mad Titan—he is purple, portrayed by a CGI-rendered Josh Brolin, and sports a skin-goatee that appears to have been diced by a mandoline. He’s ridiculous, already a joke. Star Wars’ Snoke, like Emperor Palpatine before him, is another manifestation of evil that makes no sense to us—he’s a slimy, scarred, aging creature of unknown origin that small children will describe as “really mean.” He is a cipher of terror, an excuse for the brilliant motion-capture performer Andy Serkis to try out a new snarl. That’s it. One of the brilliant aspects of The Last Jedi is writer-director Rian Johnson’s willingness to dispel and detonate all of the red herrings that emerged from the film that preceded his. Rey’s parents? Who cares. Will Luke return to fight? Whatever. Who is Snoke? Why bother. Instead, Jedi zeroes in on the most crucial relationship in this series, between Rey and Kylo. Their bond, captured in a series of psychic conversations throughout, is the centerpiece. And when their union finally occurs, nearly 90 minutes in, a movie that had been pacing itself after a breakneck opening turns purely kinetic. At the end of a simmering, balletic battle, Kylo turns toward Rey and reaches out to her: Join me, he says. “Let the past die,” he says. “Kill it, if you have to. That’s the only way to become what you were meant to be.” And even though we know that Kylo has made a choice that will affirm his manhood, we can see that he is damaged, unsure of his place in the world, selfish, vain, searching for an identity. He wants to rule the galaxy, too, just like his grandfather. Is it because he was turned by an opportunistic cult leader in Snoke? Is it because he resented his parents’ legend? Is it because he was spoiled rotten? Is it because every generation wants more than the one that came before them? The answer is yes. Some of this makes Kylo Ren unusually empathetic—even as Driver stalks across the bridge of spaceships, throttling poor British actors across the room with the flick of a wrist, we can see a broken kid acting out. And that brat becomes a scorned man, abandoned by an ungrateful woman who is clearly his better, more powerful and clear of conscience. In The Last Jedi, Emo Kylo Ren discovers indie rock. The Last Jedi makes much of his break from Luke Skywalker and the betrayal hinted at in The Force Awakens—a Rashomon-style retelling of the end of their training gives the movie a moral ambiguity that’s rare in this kind of franchise filmmaking. And Driver is abnormally gifted at conveying a weary uncertainty—vicious one moment, crestfallen the next. We still don’t quite know what happened between Luke and Kylo, not really. The mentors you have at the beginning of your career aren’t always the right ones for the next phase.  Through much of The Force Awakens, Kylo Ren wears a mask that is one part downhill racer and one part paintball fetishist. It’s a sleek but purposeless apparatus, like junior playing dress up in daddy’s suit. Snoke mocks it repeatedly. In The Last Jedi, he destroys the mask in a fit of embarrassment and frustration. His lightsaber is a neon Satanic crucifix, emitting a frayed beam of fire, like the manifestation of all that angst burning in every direction. It crackles with anxiety, nothing like the silken hum of the other lightsabers in the films. These are small choices, but important ones. The kind that make us care. The kind that make us ask, Who hurt you? Kylo Ren may be a boy at heart, but he’s a villain in full.  Three days after its release, how’s the double album landing? And was Swift’s approach to this highly personal project successful? Nora Princiotti and Nathan Hubbard discuss on ‘Every Single Album.’ Nora and Nathan are here to dive into the album and discuss ""Fortnight,"" how Swift is grappling with her level of fame, and much more!"
"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE," Call it Episode VIII or The Last Jedi, the newest instalment in the unfolding Star Wars saga is a feast for fan boys and fan girls of the space western franchise. The film, the second part in the Stars Wars sequel trilogy picks up from where Star Wars: The Force Awakens left off and can be confusing at times. But fans need not fret – Episode IX is expected to release in exactly two years.  Writer-director Rian Johnson’s story makes no consolations for newbies: you need to have watched The Force Awakens in order to truly understand the elements at work in The Last Jedi.  The movie is a sequel, pure and simple, retaining the best of the past, but Johnson also brings in many new elements with inventiveness and humour. These include cute and quirky creatures, like the amphibious alien nun-like Caretakers, Porgs (miniature puffin-like creatures) and the Vulptices or crystal foxes. Rey (Daisy Ridley), conflicted about her own identity and parentage, has found a mentor in Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Skywalker has exiled himself on a bleak and remote island. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) has embraced the Dark Side and offered up his allegiance to Snoke (Andy Serkis), the leader of the First Order. Under the leadership of Leia (Carrie Fisher in her last performance in the role), the Resistance is on the run from a brutal attack by the First Order.  Most of the story tosses between the push and pull faced by these two characters who strongly feel the power of the Force. Indeed, emotion is the bedrock of The Last Jedi, whether in gently delivered tributes to Fisher (who died last December) or in the exploration of the complexities of identity and destiny.  A fledgling romance seems a bit of a force-fit (no pun intended) and the contribution of a few characters remains on the fringe. But Poe (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew along with Joonas Suotamo) chip in with some funky cameos.  The styling, special effects, large set pieces and battles are mesmerising. There is a smart contradiction between the creaky old-school Death Star fighting machines – with a starring role for the Millennium Falcon – and the new age weaponry wielded by Snoke’s samurai-styled soldiers in stark red uniforms clashing a minimalistic hall. Droid BB-8’s role is amped up, and I loved it.  Ultimately, the story does revolve around succession and the last Jedi. Skywalker holds secrets and power: he’s part-Jedi warrior, part-trainer and part-guru. Adam Driver makes quite an impression as the beleaguered and conflicted Kylo Ren. He’s has the makings of an iconic villain, a fitting heir to Darth Vader’s legacy. With The Last Jedi, Johnson finds that sweet spot of reverentially seeing out the old to firmly make way for a new, perhaps final, space odyssey."
"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE," “Star Wars Chapter VIII: The Last Jedi” opens with a title crawl, natch, and within a few words makes a tendentious mistake, dear lord, oh my: the word “decimated” is used to mean “destroyed” or “damaged beyond repair” or “nearly snuffed.” (“Decimated” does not mean that, not even by one-tenth, even if dictionary-makers are beginning to give in.) But that’s the worst thing I can say about the tragedy-comedy-mythmaking that follows in writer-director Rian Johnson’s confabulation.  I liked it—even loved great swathes of it, moments of comic boisterousness and visual grandeur—and any eager viewer can profitably overlook the tone of hostility sizzling through a fistful of first reviews in the milliseconds that followed the end of Disney’s press embargo on Tuesday. Most of the opening-night responses online were from mixed—those who were able to inhale the dense stew of “Star Wars” series allusions in a single draught—to joyous—those who loved its breakneck pace and somber imagining of moments of great tragedy. (Porgs!) There are hints of other films and filmmakers galore, as well as the “Star Wars” of antiquity, especially widescreen Akira Kurosawa, both in framing of battle and in brandishing bold red. (A key George Lucas inspiration from Kurosawa came from an early, black-and-white Kurosawa.) The long-anticipated join between “The Force Awakens”’ closing shots with the continuation of the same scene in “Last Jedi” is dispatched in a way that pronounces Johnson’s hand, as is a scene soon after that seems patterned after the telephone bits of Bob Newhart’s stand-up comedy. My notes are mostly of moments of grace, of precise, yet gnomic movie-movie dialogue, and of startling images, all of which are worth seeing with fresh eyes. (Porgs! Porgs!) Ray’s history of Chicago Ghost Signs is planned for publication next year. Previews of the project are on Twitter and on Instagram. More photography on Instagram."

Since 1908, we’ve aimed “to injure no man, but to bless all mankind,” as our founder, Mary Baker Eddy, put it. Here, you’ll find award-winning journalism not driven by commercial influences – a news organization that takes seriously its mission to uplift the world by seeking solutions and finding reasons for credible hope. “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” is the eighth movie in the series and one of the better ones. I’d rank it behind “The Empire Strikes Back” (still by far the best) and the first film, but it’s about on par with the enjoyable last episode, “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” which also awakened the long-moribund franchise. I have no wish to turn this review into a minefield of spoiler alerts, so suffice to say “The Last Jedi” pits the weakened Resistance against the First Order meanies; it’s darker in tone than any of the films since “Empire,” which it occasionally references; and there are two welcome new additions to the series – a spunky rebel fighter named Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) and a bevy of cute critters called porgs, who resemble benign, big-eyed gremlins and no doubt will be doing double duty as stocking stuffers. Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren is in full brood here. (Has Driver ever played Hamlet?) Daisy Ridley’s Rey, in attempting to lure the equally brooding Luke out of retirement, is pretty broody herself. As returning action-hero Resistance fighters, Oscar Isaac and John Boyega are less introspective. This is all for the best. Let’s us not forget that, for all the hardware and hoo-ha, this franchise is essentially a soap opera in space, with cliffhangers as neatly timed as anything in “The Perils of Pauline.” Fanatics will love it; for the rest of us, it’s a tolerably good time. Grade: B (Rated PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi action and violence.) Monitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in. We believe news can and should expand a sense of identity and possibility beyond narrow conventional expectations. “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in.

"Dec 15, 2017",NEGATIVE," Back when George Lucas was that oddball car enthusiast and confederate of Francis Ford Coppola’s with two of the greatest and weirdest movies of the 1970s under his belt — “THX 1138” and “American Graffiti” — he really wanted to make a movie out of “Flash Gordon.” But that didn’t work out, so he moved on to cranking out his own rollicking space opera. Forty years after the first “Star Wars” movie, Lucas’s rag-and-bone shop of cribs from Kurosawa, John Ford, and Joseph Campbell has now turned into its own self-perpetuating universe with an annual haul that probably beats the GDP of some small nations. The latest installment, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” looks likely to keep that cycle going for the foreseeable future. The series has gone through many phases, most hamstrung by a desire to break from or circle back to the originating imagery that blew moviegoers’ hair back in 1977. There was the first movie’s unexpected blockbuster appeal that gave us everything from the movie toy tie-in industry to the “Star Wars Holiday Special” and then the ‘Empire Strikes Back’ and ‘Return of the Jedi,’ with their giddy mix of thrill-seeking and Wagnerian overkill spiked with Muppet Zen koans. They were fun and ridiculous and beloved and overpraised and left an outsized (and, honestly, ludicrously overblown) footprint on a generation’s cultural memory. Lucas brought on seasoned and unpretentious pros like Irwin Kershner and Richard Marquand to handle directing duties and give each story a fresh spin. The middle trilogy — ‘The Phantom Menace,’ ‘Attack of the Clones,’ and ‘Revenge of the Sith’ — had all the world-building confidence of the first movies but not nearly the spirit of inspiration. Working mostly without collaborators this time out, Lucas buried the strands of an interesting story about the tensions between democracy and imperialism in the busywork common to many prequels; not to mention a shellacking of overeager CGI and glazed performances. This batch were unloved and overcritiqued by fans who had seemingly left their childhoods on the frozen battlefields of Hoth. By the time Lucas sold off his empire to Disney and J.J. Abrams was brought on to produce ‘The Force Awakens’ in 2015, the same fans so disappointed by the Senatorial politics and Gungan slapstick of the last batch of movies had their own children and were eager to give them another shot. But where Kershner and Marquand gave a hired-gun snap to ‘Empire’ and ‘Jedi,’ Lucas buried himself in an oddball kind of pulp-pretentiousness that might have been well-nigh unwatchable at times but was, for better or worse, certainly his directorial vision. What, then, of the filmmakers who Disney has given the keys to the Lucasfilm treasure trove? Abrams, who has made a living in film riffing on other filmmakers (Spielberg with “Super 8“) and preexisting franchises (“Star Trek“), did exactly what he was expected to do: Deliver a fanboy resuscitation that basically got the band back together for one more go at the Death Star. It was a fairly mirthless endeavor that relied first on getting audiences psyched for seeing their childhood heroes like Han Solo and Leia back in the saddle and second investing them in a more appropriately diverse crop of new characters who could take the franchise forward. As entertainment it was competent and soulless. The script was so reliant on aping the original that it just reinvented the old Empire in a reincarnated form known as the First Order; they didn’t even have different uniforms. But as a widget-maker for Disney’s entertainment industrial complex it was genius, featuring just enough originality and cliffhangers to creep the story along. There was hope for ‘Rogue One’ the next year, what with Gareth Edwards at the helm. Edwards’ take on bringing back “Godzilla” was no paragon of originality, either, but his 2010 debut “Monsters” was a weird enough little curiosity that blended monster mythology with a sly jab at immigration politics that there was hope Edwards could retain some personality inside the Lucas universe. Such wasn’t the case. ‘Rogue One’ started off with some promise but very quickly turned into a hackneyed connect-the-dots exercise in cynicism that left audiences back exactly where they were at the start of the original movie. Again. It shouldn’t be a surprise with ‘The Last Jedi’ that even such an idiosyncratic director as Rian Johnson would not leave much of an imprint on the heavily defended ‘Star Wars’ universe. He’s had a short career but movies like the jaggedly hyperverbal high school noir “Brick” and the Philip K. Dick-like time travel freakout “Looper” were genius reinventions of genre that whipped through their tangled plots with the confidence that audiences could keep up. Obviously, there was too much riding on ‘The Last Jedi’ for Disney to take the chance that some fan might not get what was happening. So Johnson, who also wrote the script, delivers a whippet-quick variation on a familiar story. ‘The Last Jedi’ rests on tried-and-true formulations while dropping in a greater than expected dose of humor. Is it the best of the Disney-era movies? Definitely. There are more genuine laughs and emotional resonance here than any of the movies have managed since ‘Empire.’ Oscar Isaac’s flyboy hero Poe is the best thing to happen to the series since Han told Leia “I am nice men.” There is also something to be said for a blockbuster like this where arguably the best moment involves Laura Dern in a purple wig and the unlucky Imperial cruiser that gets in her way. But does it have even a fraction of the weird cross-genre spark that animated the original trilogy? Not at all. These days, burdened by the necessity of stringing people along to buy toys and scatter social-media heat and visit whatever new themed ride has just been rolled out, the ‘Star Wars’ universe is a trap. Given an entire galaxy to play in, each of the newer movies only manage to pluck off a tiny fragment of it to explore each time. So much energy is expended on grinding along in the unending back-and-forth between the Light and Dark sides of the Force, scrappy Rebel scum versus snooty Imperial toadies, and the tiresome Skywalker family melodrama that there just isn’t room for anything else. Lucas wasn’t a stranger to commerce; he essentially created the licensed movie character toy industry. But he was an innovator at heart. Look at the experimentations of his 1970s movies, his early involvement with the proto-guerrilla version of what became “Apocalypse Now,” and even the (yes, failed) middle ‘Star Wars’ trilogy. There is something to the slow-moving nature of the new movies that he might approve of. After all, what was he trying to do early on but recreate the appeal of the old movie serials like ‘Flash Gordon’? The way that ‘The Force Awakens’ and ‘The Last Jedi’ creep the narrative along, just enough to keep audiences hanging on for Disney to maximize ancillary revenue streams out of the property, owes much to the old serials’ efficient perpetual cliffhanger take on story. But all the Disney ‘Star Wars’ movies share not just an aversion to striking out for new territory but an insistence on returning repeatedly to the same pool of inspiration: X-wing and TIE fighter dogfights, John Williams’ score, lightsaber duels, occasional jumbles of oddball alien characters jammed into a small space, plucky Rebel heroes sacrificing themselves for the greater cause, and vague Jungian mysticism. Someday maybe a producer will allow one of these movies to strike out for new star systems where there are no Rebels and no Stormtroopers. Until then, the machine will probably just keep grinding away, fighting a holding action for time much like the always outnumbered and outgunned Rebels in ‘The Last Jedi,’ only in the service of a far less glorious cause."
"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE," Thanks to strong direction, a smartly balanced script and excellent performances from the ensemble cast, the force is strong with Star Wars: The Last Jedi. With Rian Johnson taking the sole writing and directing credit and J.J. Abrams now on board as executive producer, The Last Jedi is the second part of what’s being called the ‘Sequel Trilogy’, which retrofits the original Star Wars films with new, sometimes obviously stand-in/proxy characters so that the series can just keep going and going. It must now that Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker is getting-on and grim, Harrison Ford’s Han Solo is dead and dear Carrie Fisher sadly left us about a year ago too. Picking up shortly after the end of The Force Awakens, we begin with a surprisingly funny sequence where Resistance X Wing fly-boy Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) dangerously takes on the forces of the First Order and mocks hapless and pasty baddie General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), which leads to a considerable quotient of comedy because Johnson understands that this would be more than a little dour and pompous without it. The Resistance is under attack throughout as various faces old and new weave in and out of a multi-threaded storyline that vaguely recalls the structure of The Empire Strikes Back. Therefore the plotlines with the rebels on the run under the command of Leia (Fisher) as the bromance continues between Dameron and Finn (John Boyega) are intercut with the expected sequences where Rey (Daisy Ridley) confronts the exiled, hairy and jowly Skywalker (Hamill) on a faraway planet that, despite the FX, looks rather like the Irish coast. Hamill only barely (and silently) appeared in The Force Awakens, so here he’s given plenty of room to impress as the brooding, haunted Luke, which feels like a bit of a shock as we’re all so familiar with the youthful, golly-gee-willikers Skywalker we met 40 years ago in A New Hope. Ridley is also terrific as she learns to control her own Jedi-esque talents while Luke becomes a kind of Yoda-wannabe. This is all happening as Finn and a new character, Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), find themselves in trouble on a planet where rich races reign and they must join forces with DJ (Benicio Del Toro as a semi-Han-Solo figure). There’s much detail as well about the Vader-ish Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who’s still conflicted about his evilness and telekinetically afraid of Rey. He’s also insulted by the mainly-FX Supreme Leader Snoke, an ugly extraterrestrial sneerer ‘played’ by Andy Serkis. With deft direction by Johnson and his script that has its ominous and mythical moments but never quite feels over-the-top or silly (note Luke’s early warning line “This is not going to go the way you think”), this features strong work from Hamill, Ridley, Driver and Boyega. Laura Dern doesn’t have much to do except look worried as Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo and Fisher’s role feels somewhat incomplete, though we’ve been assured that she did indeed finish it before her death. There’s plenty of CG spectacle, striking backdrops (a globe-trotting production resulted in some striking scenery, FX or no FX), details to have diehard fans enraptured and a fair few biting gags. Then there’s just the right amount of ‘porgs’, an alien race of doe-eyed, penguin-like critters that had devotees understandably concerned in the first trailers for the film. They look like they’re going to become as annoying as the dreaded Ewoks did in Return Of The Jedi, but it seems that Johnson realised how they’d make his film too cynically cute and wisely cut their appearances way back. Thanks to Disney there are sequels, prequels, spinoffs, rip-offs and more to come (including an already controversial young Han Solo epic), so Star Wars devotees needn’t worry. We might even see a Jabba The Hutt musical comedy as we get into the 2020s. We can only hope."
"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE,"A poignant farewell to Carrie Fisher. With dynamite women leading the action on all fronts, The Last Jedi is a fitting tribute to her legacy."
"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE," With Santa visiting in just 10 nights, the holiday movie season seriously heats up this weekend as ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"" perhaps the year's most anticipated offering, commands a quartet of fresh releases. Even better news: This ninth ""Star Wars"" tale, a sequel to 2015's ""The Force Awakens,"" nicely picks up where that one left the ever-tenacious Rey (Daisy Ridley) finally running into the legendary Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) on top of a deserted mountaintop far, far away. Two companion plots reawaken heroic characters, too, including daring pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and ex-storm trooper Finn (John Boyega), each involved in separate adventures that also introduce some newcomers to the space party. The latter hooks up with the keenly rebellious Rose Tico (the sparklingly odd Kelly Marie Tran) for some derring-do, while Poe spends many moments arguing with rebel leadership, headed by General Leia (the late Carrie Fisher in her final role) and a cunning vice admiral (Laura Dern). Benicio Del Toro, Andy Serkis (back as the snaky Snoke), Adam Driver (the conflicted Kylo Ren) and some key placement for Billie Lourd (Fisher's daughter) help prove that writer/director Rian Johnson (""Looper"" and ""Brick"") understands a thing or three about keeping a huge franchise healthy, wealthy and wise. After all, even if real fanboys are not pleased with some of the revelations (and, perhaps, not all should be believed), it says here that the major impact of The Force will go a long way in keeping everyone relatively happy. The sheer power of ""Star Wars"" notwithstanding, the week's finest movie, ""The Shape of Water,"" already arrives with a slew of honors, including a whopping 14 Critics' Choice nominations, seven more of the Golden Globes variety, and two from the Screen Actors Guild. Simply put, sci-fi mainstay Guillermo del Toro has given us a movie lover's dream in a romantic fantasy/thriller that finds a mute cleaning woman (the brilliant Sally Hawkins) becoming infatuated with the mysterious subject of a very top-secret (and mean-spirited) experiment. That would be a potent fish-man (played by Doug Jones), who's very reminiscent of the '50s era ""Creature from the Black Lagoon."" Naturally, then, co-writer/director del Toro surrounds his Cold War-era environment with suspicion, intrigue and -- best of all -- various flights of fancy. Most of those fairytale moments include the tiny Hawkins, who soars opposite both Jones and her flighty apartment mate, played by the always great Richard Jenkins. Octavia Spencer, as a faithful pal/co-worker, and a pair of grand guys named Michael, Shannon and Stuhlbarg, perform swimmingly as well. Of course, we'd expect no less in this truly rarified ""Water."" Speaking of fairytales, Baby Boomers certainly will recognize the story of ""Ferdinand,"" especially since the Oscar-winning animated short (from way back in 1938, by the way) seemed to play endlessly on television's long-running ""Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color."" Now big John Cena, the WWE rassler whom TV helped turn into another kind of superstar, voices the even bigger bull in a cute and cuddly film that somehow wound up in the hands of Fox and its partners at Blue Sky Animation Studio. Regardless, Cena does an OK job in relating the warmth of the titled beast, which would rather smell flowers than pick suicidal fights with matadors (an occupation that gets some deserved comeuppance here.) Two of Ferdinand's less sensitive friends sound a lot like Anthony Anderson and Peyton Manning, to name just a few, but the vocal scene-stealer becomes a ""Calming Goat"" wildly expressed by frenetic ""SNL"" star Lisa McKennon. Finally, there's the latest from prolific writer and director Woody Allen, who comes up with a very special movie about every six or seven years. Unfortunately, ""Wonder Wheel"" is not one of them, despite the best efforts of leading lady Kate Winslet and world-class cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Reds,"" ""The Last Emperor""). While the solid Winslet is trying to save the film as the unhappy young wife to a Ralph Kramden-like Coney Island ride operator (Jim Belushi), fellow Oscar-winner Storaro is filling the screen with some lovely shots of early-'50s midways, beachfronts and manufactured melodrama. In fact, if it weren't for those memorable sunsets and under-the-boardwalk sequences, ""Wheel"" easily could have been a play, and maybe Allen had that in mind somewhere along the line in his long career, anyway. He also adds a bratty kid (Jack Gore) that can't stop burning stuff, and an unsophisticated lifeguard/aspiring writer (Justin Timberlake), who prefers the more literal and romantic interpretation of playing with fire.

"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE," PLOT:  With the Rebellion in tatters, Rey (Daisy Ridley) travels to a remote planet to find Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the last of the Jedi Knights. In the meantime, a brutal battle with The First Order threatens to do away with the Resistance once and for all. REVIEW:  STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI is easily the best STAR WARS movie since RETURN OF THE JEDI – everyone will agree with that. Controversially though, it may also be the best since THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and maybe even the best directed film in the saga as a whole. While a bit bogged down by wisecracks (a leftover from THE FORCE AWAKENS), on the whole this is an epic, stirring installment in the series, and one that’s so good you can see why Kathleen Kennedy is betting so heavily on writer-director Rian Johnson by giving him his own trilogy once this one is complete. That Johnson’s the real deal is something well-known to fans. BRICK was a stunning debut, THE BROTHERS BLOOM was horribly underrated, and LOOPER was kick-ass. He handles the mega-budget scope of THE LAST JEDI with aplomb, both crafting a film that works as part of the canon, but also packed with enough of his own idiosyncrasies to make it a distinct work. It also marks the long-awaited return of Mark Hamill to the fold, with his presence in THE FORCE AWAKENS having been limited to the last scene. He hasn’t lost a beat as Luke, playing him as more cantankerous with age, and still prone to the occasional burst of impetuousness. It’s a well-thought out performance, and one that Hamill brings a lot of gravitas too, similar to how Harrison Ford aced his return in THE FORCE AWAKENS. Carrie Fisher, in her last film, is also much more prominent this time as Leia. She’s a major part of the plot, with a nice relationship established between her and her number-one hotshot (and occasional thorn in her side) Poe Dameron (as cooler-than-cool Oscar Isaac) as well as her second in command, Laura Dern’s Admiral Holdo. Everyone from THE FORCE AWAKENS is given plenty to do, with this continuing to be mainly about the tug-of-war between Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), with their relationship the anchor that grounds the trilogy. Both really add extra layers of nuance to their parts, particularly Driver, who comes more into focus here now that he’s dealing with the fallout from him murdering his father in the last film. Probably my favorite part of THE LAST JEDI though comes from the b-plot, which sends Finn (John Boyega) and new addition to the franchise Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) to a planet that’s kind of like the Monte Carlo of outer space. Here Johnson’s love of film history really runs wild in the best possible way, with a great homage to the silent classic WINGS, and a gem of a part for Benicio Del Toro, who steals scenes as a character that struck me as something of a tribute to both Peter Lorre and Tomas Millian’s Monnezza character from seventies Italian gangster movies. It’s wonderful. Easily the longest film in the franchise, the 152 minute running time is well-earned, with them telling an epic story that needed room to breathe, although there’s maybe a few too many throwaway gags, with the beloved BB-8 and those new Porg guys getting loads of screen time (a gag with them and Chewie is especially good). STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI is likely as good as it’s ever gonna get for a new era STAR WARS movie unless Lucasfilm really lets one of their directors go wild. Johnson has crafted a terrific addition to the franchise working within those confines, and it’s big, four-quadrant tent pole filmmaking done just right. Even those fans who were disappointed by THE FORCE AWAKENS may find themselves won over by this infectious installment. It’s a blast from start-to-finish. Chris Bumbray began his career with JoBlo as the resident film critic (and James Bond expert) way back in 2007, and he has stuck around ever since, being named editor-in-chief in 2021. A voting member of the CCA and a Rotten Tomatoes-approved critic, you can also catch Chris discussing pop culture regularly on CTV News Channel. "
"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE," Star Wars: The Last Jedi — the eighth installment since George Lucas first began telling this tale set in a galaxy far, far away — sees the new breed of young rebels from …The Force Awakens (2015) continue their epic struggle against the dark side. Rian Johnson (Looper), taking over from director JJ Abrams, transports the viewer back to a world of intergalactic heroes, wondrous creatures and dazzling light-sabre duels. The General spearheading the rebellion (the late Carrie Fisher, to whom the film is dedicated) is determined to save her spaceship and its crew from annihilation; the orphaned former scavenger (Daisy Ridley) must persuade the exiled Jedi (the ever-impressive Mark Hamill) to rejoin their cause. Meanwhile, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), the apprentice to the film’s big bad villain Snoke (Andy Serkis, in another formidable motion-capture performance) is riddled with doubt over the choices he has made. He must decide, will he redeem himself or revert to his villainous ways?"
"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE,"Overall, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an engaging mesh of new and old threads of past and present Star Wars narratives coming together to make a cohesive and exciting film."
"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE," ""Waaayy overhyped,"" grumbled the gentleman behind me as we both exited ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi."" He was registering disappointment to his devoted family, not a fellow from the working press in front of him. Grumblers and sourpusses are usually the first to exit theaters when the giant tentpole movies open. I'm always among them only because I don't like to dawdle getting to the parking lot. It's a life strategy I recommend to all who might be interested. Less than an hour after seeing it, one of my Facebook friends -- and an experienced contributor of movie reviews -- had strewn her page with hearts and love notes to the new 40th anniversary of ""Star Wars."" She was in tears at the end, she said. I have never been among America's most passionate Star Warriors. I'm just not a passionate saga guy, whether the saga involves Tolkien doings in the Shire, or ""Harry Potter"" wizardry, or ""Star Wars"" or ""Star Trek"" or ""The Hunger Games"" or whatever else people like to steer their lives and imaginations by. I'm not averse to any of those films, mind you, but I'm never among the first in line or the loudest in their cheering sections. I like the saga folks (sometimes dismissed as ""fanboys"" and ""fangirls""). I always find them among the gentlest and most peaceful and imaginative among us but I'm just not in their tribe. My tribe -- The Skeptics -- dresses even worse, and we're just as peace-loving but we insist on not passing judgment until it's necessary. So what's necessary to know about the 40th anniversary ""Star Wars"" is that, at two and a half hours, it's at least a half-hour too long (maybe 45 minutes) and it's overfull of the usual digital battle sequences which so many of us have come to consider a wee bit old hat in the decades since ""Star Wars"" introduced us to a new thing back in 1977. It's a wee bit tiring, too, for non-saga people to follow. The toy that kids will probably want to have from the film is a little Porg, named after the lovable, wide-eyed critters who hang out with Wookies and who look like little owls whose constant expression is one of astonishment and alarm. You could do a lot worse, believe me, than to have the little ones in the family going to bed at night with little baby Porgs on the pillow next to them. The loathsome disgusting slob in the movie -- in the grand tradition of the incomparably epicene Jabba the Hutt -- is Snoke, played by that most overlooked of performing geniuses, Andy Serkis, the mega specialist who usually operates under a ton of makeup and digital razzle dazzle. The big battle scene is between Daisy Ridley as Rey, the New Swashbuckleress of the Empire, and Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, the name taken by Ben Solo who, we all know, is the offspring of Han Solo and Princess Leia, even though he was raised in the Jedi Way by Luke Skywalker. Family relationships are the dramatic crux here which is why I'll reveal no more. I do think, however, Kylo/Ben has a staggering amount of plot baggage to carry in this movie which is why Driver has disappointed quite a few people. Not his fault. He's a fine actor but no Superman of the actor's trade, as he'd almost have to be to carry this movie off well. Carrie Fisher died tragically a year ago at the age of 60 but not before leaving enough ""footage"" to make Princess Leia prominent enough in a grandmotherly way in the 40th anniversary ""Star Wars."" And thank heaven at least for that. Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd has a small role in the movie which should have been bigger for emotion's sake. The biggest returning star here, of course, is Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker. In this new ""Episode VIII"" he looks a bit like an old Roadie for Led Zeppelin but that works for what writer/director Rian Johnson has designed for his role. When we first see him, he's a hermit and recluse living on a remote island in a far corner of the universe, where, in his disenchantment, he's working on a way to destroy the whole Jedi way of life. The big combatants in the plot are the Forces of The Resistance (Fisher, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Laura Dern, and Oscar Isaac as what Dern calls ""a trigger happy flyboy"" named Poe Dameron) and The First Order of ugly guys distinguished by oozy, scarred-up makeup and careless hairdressing (Serkis, Driver, Domhnall Gleeson as a miscellaneous general). Benicio Del Toro has a small role for hipster cred. It's all watchable to those of us in the Skeptics Tribe. I tacked on an extra half star to the star rating for this solely because of my outsized affection for a glorious section in the middle that I enjoyed as I have few other ""Star Wars"" side journeys. In the middle of this, the gang goes to a kind of Interstellar Las Vegas gambling casino called Canto Bight where all the evil arms dealers in the universe congregate to gamble way their ill-gotten gains at the gaming tables and races run along long tracks by giant cuddlesome rabbits instead of horses. Even in a film that's at least a half hour too long, I'd have been delighted to see 10 more minutes of space decadence in Canto Bight, ""the Casino Planet"" which was actually filmed in Dubrovnik. Star Warriors will, no doubt, be enriched by such super-abundance and more than a little. Grown up members of the Skeptics Tribe will enjoy just enough to feel minimal regret at the film's overlength in its 40th anniversary year. Starring Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac, John Boyega, Adam Driver and Laura Dern. Directed by Rian Johnson. 152 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action and violence."
"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE," Typical for the Star Wars franchise, the main tension here is between good and evil, light and dark; characters must decide whether to choose the path they were brought up to believe in or the ""other"" side. Underlines the idea that everyone has a choice about which moral code to believe in and which mission to accept. Explores how transformative hope can be for people. The importance of friendship, courage, teamwork, loyalty, listening to others, and doing the right thing is demonstrated again and again. Rey continues to be a strong, capable, and courageous character. In fact, all of the female characters -- including Leia, Vice Admiral Holdo, and Rose -- are front and center, making tough decisions, leading bravely, and more. Finn is determined to help Rey. Poe is often impulsive and brash, but he's also brave and intelligent, and he does learn to respect others' abilities/plans. While the clearly evil First Order is virtually all white (although there are a few women, like the helmeted Captain Phasma), the Resistance is notably diverse, with white, black, Latino, and Asian characters (as well as those from other intergalactic species), women in leadership positions, etc. Plenty of sci-fi action violence, mostly large-scale space battles and explosions, as well as one-on-one duels, shoot-outs, and pursuits. One death is particularly explicit -- the character is sliced in half -- but there isn't any blood. Dozens of Resistance ships are destroyed, with ""good guys"" killed. Many weapons are used in addition to the classic lightsabers, including bombs and fighter planes. A couple of people sacrifice themselves in suicide missions. An officer orders an entire fleet destroyed, and another leader gives the order that there will be no prisoners, no mercy. The Supreme Leader of the First Order could be scary to kids. Spoiler alert: Supporting characters are injured and killed. A couple of people are presumed dead, and there's one notable good-guy death, but it's not as sad as Han Solo's traumatizing murder in The Force Awakens. Two characters have an intense, supernatural bond that's nearly romantic at times. A character quickly kisses another character before passing out. Kylo Ren is shirtless in one scene. Characters in a casino wear revealing dresses and outfits. On camera, nothing; but off camera, the Star Wars franchise is a merchandiser's dream, with branded/themed apparel, games, accessories, housewares, action figures, Lego sets, food, toys, and just about anything else you can imagine. Parents need to know that Star Wars: Episode VIII: The Last Jedi is part of the billion-dollar Star Wars saga, continuing the segment of the story that began in The Force Awakens. It takes place right after the events of that movie and is just as violent, with several battles, explosions, space chases, and close-up duels. There's one rather explicit death (though it's not bloody), and several people die in battle, in some cases sacrificing themselves for their mission. A few times it seems like characters are near death, but they recover. Romance-wise, expect to see one quick, chaste kiss, and some slightly uncomfortable tension between two other characters. Adam Driver's Kylo Ren appears shirtless in one scene for no apparent reason other than to fluster a female character, and there's an odd shot of a character milking a lactating creature and then drinking the milk. Characters also drink cocktails in a luxury casino. Language is tame, with a few uses of words including ""damn,"" ""what the hell,"" ""shut up,"" and the like. Directed by Rian Johnson, the movie boasts several strong female characters, including both Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Leia (Carrie Fisher), as well as diversity within the Resistance and strong messages of courage, teamwork, hope, and loyalty. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. STAR WARS: EPISODE VIII: THE LAST JEDI takes place right after the events of The Force Awakens, with Commander Poe (Oscar Isaac) and the rest of the Resistance fighters facing a First Order dreadnought, while Rey (Daisy Ridley) tracks down Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in hopes of convincing him to join the Republic's mission. As General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) follows what remains of the Resistance's fleet, a revived Finn (John Boyega) teams up with Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), a grieving technician, and Poe in a risky scheme to shut down the First Order's tracking system. Luke senses Rey's powerful potential, but it scares him -- reminding him of his failure to keep Ben/Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) away from the dark side. Speaking of which, Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) berates a conflicted Kylo Ren to stop whining and take his rightful place as Darth Vader's heir apparent. Director Rian Johnson delivers a funny, emotional, suspenseful middle-of-the-trilogy installment that will delight fans as it elevates beloved heroes and moves the story forward. The Last Jedi's female characters, from Rey and Leia (Carrie Fisher) to new additions Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), are decisive, courageous, and fierce. War hero Holdo puts Poe in his place, commanding the Resistance with assurance and hope. Rose is a sweet addition, going from deferential to confident during her time with Finn. And of course, there's Rey, who learns more in this movie about her connection to the Force and puts everything on the line to give Kylo Ren an opportunity to become Ben again. The men are great, too, particularly Hamill, who portrays Luke with the nuance necessary for a deeply conflicted but wise man who's seen far more death and destruction than anyone should. There's even a cameo from one of his long-gone mentors that's likely to make viewers gasp -- and cheer. Johnson ups the humor while keeping the action operatic in style. Gleeson's pompous General Hux is hilariously cowardly when dealing with Poe and Kylo Ren. Finn and Rose's adventure to find a master coder at a luxury casino has several buddy-comedy road trip elements, and Chewbacca's interaction with the adorable puffin-like porgs is awww-inducing. The fight scenes range from explosive to up close and personal. Among several standout lightsaber fights, one epic duel is more profound than expected. Despite a few minor missteps (like an odd scene in which Luke milks a large creature with four teats and immediately drinks its milk, or an unnecessary and unexpected quick kiss between two characters who've exhibited zero romantic tension), The Last Jedi beautifully sets up what needs to happen for the forces of good to win. Families can talk about the violence in Star Wars: Episode VIII: The Last Jedi. Do scenes of explosions and space battles affect you differently than those of close-up, one-on-one lightsaber duels and killings? Why do you think that is? What makes more of an impact: violence or loss? Why? How does this movie handle both topics? How is diversity -- and a lack thereof -- used to indicate the values of the opposing sides of the conflict in the Star Wars series? Why is it notable that the First Order has very little diversity, while the Republic has a lot of it? Did you notice the strong female characters in the movie? How has the world of Star Wars changed in this respect since the original trilogy (or even the prequels)? Talk about the themes from the previous movies that repeat themselves here. Why are issues of good vs. evil, mentorship, and so on so important to this series? How do they play out on-screen?

"Dec 15, 2017",NEUTRAL," As recently as the lackluster episodes I-III of the Star Wars saga, the embossed gold logo followed by scrolling prologue text was cause for excitement. In the approach to the release of any of the then new prequel installments, the Twentieth Century Fox fanfare, followed by the Lucas Film logo, teased one’s impulsive excitement at a glimpse into the next installment’s narrative. Then sat in the movie theatre on the anticipated day of release, the sight and sound of the Twentieth Century Fox fanfare signalled the end of fevered anticipation. Whatever happened to those times? For some of us, is it a product of youth in which age now denies us the ability to lose ourselves within such adolescent pleasure? There’s no answer to this question — only the realisation that this sensation is missing and it has been since the summer of 2005. Star Wars is now a movie to tick off your to-watch list, no longer a spark in the dreary reality of the everyday. The magic has disappeared… Star Wars is spiritually dead. J.J. Abrams’s The Force Awakens (2015), co-written with Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt, is a stabilising film following Lucas’ regrettable and ill-advised prequel trilogy. While Lucas forgot the audience’s imagination is sacrosanct, so too have a new generation of filmmakers. Think back to Obi-Wan in A New Hope (1977) telling Luke of the fate of his father at the hands of Darth Vader. Those words reverberating within the emporium of the audience’s mind are more potent than anything Lucas would eventually conjure up on screen. There’s a moment in which the audience become authors of the story, something both understood and expressed by Billy Wilder when he spoke with Charlotte Chandler for Nobody’s Perfect (2002). He was speaking of the post-film fate of Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine’s relationship in The Apartment (1960). From the original trilogy to the prequel, and now the sequel films, Star Wars was first blighted by the expositional travails of its origin story, and now the cyclic restrictions of archetypal narrative.  The blue prints of episodes IV and VI beneath the surface of Abrams and Rian Johnson’s films cast their efforts as inferior and unnecessary remakes, in part as a consequence of naturally forming cyclic narrative through lines. Although The Last Jedi does deviate from the Empire template, there are narrative similarities, from Rey (Daisy Ridley) seeking out Luke (Mark Hamill) in exile to learn the ways of the Jedi, to the ice battle. In fact, Johnson does not solely use the original sequel as a template, but A New Hope, as Poe (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) enact a cunning plan that makes the acquaintance of a character in Benicio Del Toro, with shades of former renegade Han Solo.  These films of oppression and resistance, good and evil are restrictive in their scope, their multi episode continuation an echo chamber that would best left to the silence of imagination over big screen realisation. Star Wars has become a broken record, with a faulty premise of philosophical balance, that can only be handled appropriately by breaking its defined structure. What is required is for it to move outward toward a psychologically inclined hero’s journey, in which a sole individual confronts their duality of good and evil in order to break the poppycock philosophy at the heart of the Star Wars mythology. But doing so would fracture the form, the narrative, and the aesthetic language of its escapist and fantastical universe. The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi are reluctant to stray too far from the familiar compromises the natural growth of the series. David Cronenberg’s cinema has witnessed the evolution of his voice, the types of films changing dramatically in spite of the author as a constant. Bob Dylan transitioned from acoustic to electric guitar, and similarly to Cronenberg encountered a backlash of rejection and admonishment from fans discontent with creative and expressive evolution. The responsible artist, however, looks to protect and nurture the integrity of the art or work. This bold act is required by the new generation of filmmakers advancing the saga’s story. Even within the scope of the familial relationship, The Last Jedi is shown up by its elder relation The Empire Strikes Back (1983), which remains the watermark of the series.  A statement film following from A New Hope, in all phases it was refined, from the absence of stilted dialogue with a more tightly-knit narrative, to a maturing visual confidence exhibited by the filmmakers. With its first sequel, Star Wars asserted itself as a serious piece of art, yet did not compromise its childlike nature and commercial viability. While The Force Awakens exploited nostalgia to get over with the audience, one expected The Last Jedi to be a statement film, following in the tradition of history. Failing to deliver that traditional darker middle chapter, of the heroes cornered and digging themselves out of a hole, it makes no statement other than to continue the lethargic trajectory of imitation. Johnson’s miscue has posed a disquieting question: Are these filmmakers authors or fans?  The need for Johnson to have made this statement is the necessity for the sequel trilogy to find its footing, to find its identity in the universe it calls home. So far Abrams and Johnson resemble children at play, remaking the films they fell in love with. As an audience, however, we desire a fuller experience — the familiar and unique warmth of a Star Wars film with a sense of progression. As with adaptation, this new generation of filmmakers are struggling with capturing the spiritual essence while expanding and interpreting the world in new and interesting, even transformative ways. The words Johnson writes in which Luke describes the Jedi story as one of failure comes full circle — a self-reflective comment that contextualises not only these two sequel installments, but also the prequel films as exercises in failure.  A worrying omen remains in John Williams’s score, which fractionally registers in The Last Jedi. From the industrial, raw and romantic music of the original trilogy, to the polished scores of the prequel films, struggling to prop up the weak narratives and moments Lucas regrettably envisioned, to the now fading presence in this latest installment, Williams’s scores are intertwined with the life force of the films themselves. They chronicle the rise and fall of the saga from an emerging and prominent film series, to a shadow of its former self.  This decline can be witnessed through the childlike innocence of the original trilogy with its black and white morality, beneath which were thoughtful ideas underpinning such simplicity. From ideas of psychology and the confrontation of the Jungian shadow complex, to Lando Calrissian’s (Billy Dee Williams) failed attempts of appeasement, the films are permeated with a psychological, cultural and historical resonance. While the prequel films still have a semblance of this, no matter how weak, Abrams and Johnson have struggled to reassert this weight of soul or spirit. As staples of the mainstream cinema, more significant is the question whether Star Wars symbolises the mainstreams vanishing intellectual inclination and its propensity for subversive thoughtfulness in the least likely and unexpected of places?"
"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE," The burden of legacies is a mixed blessing that is hard to come to terms with. That which inspires people can end up dominating what they do, and so they are perpetually in the shadow of their forebears and only produce inferior echoes and pastiches of what came before. The most talented filmmakers are the ones that are able to properly synthesize their inspirations into something new, combining disparate parts into a unique whole that carries a singular voice while still touching on the familiar. The latest installment in the “Star Wars” saga, “The Last Jedi,” finds characters at a crossroads between living in the old dynamics and forging ahead with something new and unseen. Similarly, writer/director Rian Johnson was tasked with making something that felt familiar to other “Star Wars” adventures and yet was boldly new enough to create its own devotees. Unfortunately, the resulting film is a bit of a mess that has moments that feel beautiful and vibrant, only to be followed up by boring and emotionally shallow scenes that will leave viewers feeling cold. While there is much to admire in what Johnson has crafted, it is nonetheless a mixed bag. Directly following the events of “The Force Awakens,” the film finds the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), fleeing their base as First Order forces approach. They suffer heavy losses in escaping but soon find themselves on the run from the First Order fleet, which looks to wipe out the Resistance entirely. Finn (John Boyega) and Resistance mechanic Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) embark on a mission to stop the First Order from tracking their ships. Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley) attempts to coax Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) into training her in the ways of the Force, something he has sworn against doing, as he merely wants the Jedi to die with him. During her stay with Skywalker, Rey finds herself in contact with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), and the two begin to develop a bond that may supersede the old dynamics of Jedi and Sith. All of these storylines depart and converge at different points as the Resistance finds itself backed into a corner in order to fight another day. First, the good parts of the movie: this is a gorgeous film and easily the best looking “Star Wars” entry and blockbuster in a long time. Johnson, cinematographer Steve Yedlin and production designer Rick Heinrichs have composed incredibly beautiful shots and compositions that will linger in the minds of audiences for decades. Many of these moments – like the design of Supreme Leader Snoke’s (Andy Serkis) throne room or a fight on the mineral planet of Crait towards the end – will soon pass into iconic legends that will be referenced by filmmakers for many generations. There are a few clunky CGI moments, but mostly, the special effects are pretty seamless and Johnson and the ILM crew have dreamed up some excellently designed creatures to populate this galaxy far, far away. Most of the acting is good across the board. Driver is still very emo as Kylo Ren, but that’s the perfect note to hit on a conflicted brat with a lot of power and not much patience or control. Boyega, Ridley, Hamill, Fisher and Oscar Isaac all step back into their roles without losing a beat and imbue them each with depth and lightness that makes them incredibly winning. Newcomer Tran is very close to the heart of “The Last Jedi,” playing the plucky Resistance fighter that dreams of a world free from the carnage and cruelty of groups like the First Order. The problems mostly lie in a fundamental misunderstanding between busyness and complexity. The plot is incredibly convoluted and jumps through a lot of hoops to arrive at the finale, all while trying to show the various shades of gray that exist between the forces of Good and Evil. The problem is that it’s very rarely engaging and doesn’t feel deep. Instead, it feels falsely profound, imitating the motions of adding layers to a situation and characters. That puts “The Last Jedi” at a distance from viewers; it banks on an emotional truth that it never earns, and so it’s not easy to connect with what’s going on, as it can actually feel muddled or, worse yet, boring. Further pushing the disconnect is that the script is far too self-aware, constantly making the sort of jokes that nerds have been making about “Star Wars” for decades, as if it’s too cool to purely accept itself on its own merits. The comedy works about half the time, but there are a ton of jokes in this film that underscore all of the overly serious talk of hope that populates the movie. It seems as if Johnson took the “opera” part of “space opera” to heart and decided to make all of the emotions play larger than they need to (or have before in the “Star Wars” films). Furthermore, there are boring set pieces that are far too reminiscent of prequel sequences that are intended as fun but feel fake and unimportant to the overall narrative. The score by John Williams is completely phoned-in, mostly playing the hits from the original trilogy and banking on nostalgia to link the scenes to childhood memories. And on the subject of nostalgia, “The Last Jedi” doesn’t trade on it or have as many nods to the original films as “The Force Awakens,” thankfully, but the structure of the story and the stakes of the film are very similar to “The Empire Strikes Back” in a sort of subconscious callback to that beloved masterpiece. “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” is a muddled movie that has some incredibly high points and beautiful scenes that will stay with audiences for many years to come, but it also contains a lot of distracting filler and pseudo-intellect that has never been present in anything else Johnson has made. As a Rian Johnson film, it’s probably his weakest to date, because although gorgeous, the director’s script leaves much to be desired. As a “Star Wars” film, it’s probably on par with “Return of the Jedi” (and definitely still better than the prequels). It’s a shame that all of the awkward moments, heavy-handed allusions and emotional distance couldn’t have been solved, because without those, this would have been one of the best sci-fi films of all time. All of the pieces were there to create a masterpiece, but unfortunately, they never quite fit the way they should to produce something wholly enjoyable. You can find our full content archive

"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE," Cineasta, docente, y crítico de cine. Miembro de la APRECI —Asociación de Prensa Cinematográfica y la OFCS – Online Film Critics Society. Cofundador y editor en FotografíaCalato.com y NoEsEnSerie.com, y crítico de Cinencuentro.com, MeGustaElCine.com, y Ventana Indiscreta. El estreno de una película de Star Wars siempre va a ser uno de los eventos más esperados del año. Luego de la divertida pero algo previsible “El despertar de la Fuerza”, las expectativas hacia “Star Wars: Episodio VIII – Los Últimos Jedi” no podían ser más altas, especialmente considerando que  Rian Johnson (talentoso director de “Looper”, y de algunos de los mejores episodios de “Breaking Bad”) se ha encargado del guion y de la dirección. No importa qué fuese a pasar, no todos los fanáticos estarán contentos con el resultado final. Está claro que Johnson ha tomado algunos riesgos. Mientras que la cinta anterior era, en muchos aspectos, demasiado parecida a la primera entrega de la franquicia, “Los Últimos Jedi” es extremadamente diferente a lo que se ha visto anteriormente. De hecho, rompe con varios esquemas ya establecidos de la saga, e incluso juega un poco con diferentes conceptos relacionados a la Fuerza, razón por la que muchos fanáticos ya la están declarando como una decepción total. La recepción por parte de la crítica ha sido, en general, positiva, pero la opinión de los seguidores más acérrimos está muy dividida. Pues a este crítico le gustan los riesgos, y aunque “Los Últimos Jedi” se trata de una película algo estirada y, por momentos, un poco disparatada, se trata de una gran entrega de la venerable saga, un filme que se dedica ha introducir giro tras giro, sorpresa tras sorpresa, para subvertir las expectativas de los fanáticos, y desarrollar una historia en la que pasan muchísimas cosas importantes, tanto a nivel macro, como en relación a las películas anteriores. Como le contaba a unos amigos al salir de la sala de cine, siento que he visto tres películas en una. “Los Últimos Jedi” comienza pocos minutos luego del final de “El Despertar de la Fuerza”. La Resistencia, liderada por la General Leia (Carrie Fisher) y el comandante Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) está evacuando su base en D’Qar, pero han sido interceptados por la flota de la Primera Orden, liderada por el General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson). Mientras tanto, Finn despierta de su coma preocupado por su amiga Rey, y decide ir a buscarla. En el proceso conoce a Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), una mecánica de la Resistencia. Con su ayuda, visitará el casino de Canto Bight, en donde tendrán que encontrar la manera de ayudar a la flota de la Resistencia a escapar de la Primera Orden. ¿Y Rey (Daisy Ridley)? Pues está en la isla del Primer Templo Jedi de Ach-To, en donde el maestro Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) se niega a entrenarla; tiene miedo de su potencial, luego de haber fallado con su último alumno, Ben Solo, alias Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Sin embargo, poco a poco nuestra protagonista logrará convencerlo de que le enseñe las tradiciones de los Jedi; después de todo, necesitará su ayuda para poder regresar donde la Resistencia y por fin vencer a Ren, y a su misterioso maestro, el Líder Supremo Snoke (Andy Serkis). Luke no estaba bromeando en el trailer cuando lo escuchamos decir que “las cosas no saldrán como creen”. Si hay algo que diferencia a “Los Últimos Jedi” de las entregas anteriores de la saga, es que se dedica a desarmar las expectativas que uno podría tener sobre la dirección que tomará la historia. Por ende, algunos personajes que uno consideraba importantes resultan ser menos relevantes, y otros, tanto nuevos como antiguos, cobran un rol más participativo en la trama. Las escenas entre Rey y Luke son lo mejor que tiene la película por ofrecer, y logran introducir nuevos conceptos relacionados a la Fuerza que Skywalker aprendió luego de ser traicionado por su más talentoso alumno. Este Luke no es el mismo chico esperanzado y alegre de la trilogía original; aquí tenemos a un Maestro lleno de arrepentimientos, harto de los conflictos de la galaxia, y decepcionado por los Jedi que tanto admiraba. Trata de demostrarle todo esto a Rey, pero como podrán imaginarse, ella trata de convencerlo de que no le fallará, de que la Galaxia sí necesita de su ayuda para poder sobrevivir. “Los Últimos Jedi” se enfoca mucho en las aventuras de nuestros protagonistas, y no tanto en los problemas de la galaxia en general; podría decirse que esto hace la película se sienta más pequeña, y hasta cierto punto es cierto —hasta ahora no revelan mucho del contexto en el que surgió la Primera Orden de las cenizas del Imperio, al menos no fuera de las novelas y los cómics—, pero a la vez, hace que “Los Últimos Jedi” se sienta más como una historia de personajes. En ese sentido, se parece bastante a “El Imperio Contraataca”; está llena de acción y grandes efectos visuales, pero se concentra en las relaciones y problemas entre los personajes principales —especialmente Rey y Luke, y Rey y Kylo Ren— y no tanto en el contexto social y político de la Galaxia, Muy, Muy Lejana (como lo hicieron las precuelas). Hamill da su mejor actuación como Luke Skywalker; realmente compensa la participación tan pequeña (literalmente de un par de minutos) que tuvo en “El despertar de la Fuerza”. Daisy Ridley sigue desarrollando a Rey como una protagonista llena de conflictos internos, siempre mirando al futuro y al pasado, pensando en su destino y en los padres que nunca conoció, con ganas de convertirse en una Jedi y a ayudar a la Resistencia. Adam Driver convierte a Kylo Ren en una figura trágica; continúa su tendencia a hacer berrinches, pero se sienten menos absurdos que en la película anterior. Oscar Isaac sigue siendo muy divertido como Poe, y el General Hux de Domhnall Gleeson se ha convertido en una suerte de figura cómica; ya no es tan intimidante como en “El despertar de la Fuerza” (a pesar de que sigue sobreactuando de lo lindo). ¿Y qué hay del Líder Supremo Snoke de Andy Serkis? Pues dicho personaje es tratado de maneras que no me esperaba. Obviamente no les malograré las sorpresas que la película tiene reservadas para su público; solo diré que los misterios relacionados a Snoke, así como la identidad de los padres de Rey, y otras interrogantes con las que nos dejó “El despertar de la Fuerza”, han sido manejadas de manera bastante inesperadas, chocantes, y estoy seguro que para algunos, anticlimáticas. Como mencioné líneas arriba; Johnson decidió tomar riesgos sin importarle lo que algunos fanáticos puedan pensar. El estilo de Rian Johnson es muy distinto al de J.J. Abrams o George Lucas; su cámara es dinámica sin ser hiperactiva, y la dirección de fotografía hace un buen uso de los rojos, los blancos y los grises para mostrarnos una Galaxia inundada en la oscuridad, con una pizca de luz en el horizonte. Los efectos visuales son espectaculares; a pesar de ser totalmente digitales, Snoke se ve convincente, y tanto las batallas espaciales como los conflictos en Tierra, superan a todo lo que se ha visto antes en la franquicia. Estilísticamente, Johnson se aleja de lo que Lucas y Abrams hicieron antes; “Los Últimos Jedi” no tiene miedo de cambiar un poco las cosas, tanto así que ciertas escenas no se sienten tan “de Star Wars”. Lo cual no quiere decir que todo en la película funcione. El segundo acto está demasiado estirado, por ejemplo; toda la sección en Canto Bight, aunque visualmente impresionante, tiene poco o nada que ver con la trama central. Además, por momentos ni siquiera se siente como “Star Wars”, especialmente cuando Johnson decide transmitir lecciones «ecológicas» que no se han visto antes en la franquicia. Por otro lado, a pesar de ser bastante intensa por momentos, y de manejar una historia en la que nuestros héroes fallan continuamente —de hecho, el fracaso es uno de los temas principales de la película, tanto así que uno de los personajes lo menciona textualmente—, “Los Últimos Jedi” es sorprendentemente graciosa. La mayoría de los diálogos cursis y los gags funcionan, pero sí hubo uno que otro momento que me recordó a las películas de Marvel, donde insertan chistes innecesarios en escenas que deberían tomarse mucho más en serio. Los Porgs no me molestaron para nada. Sí, claramente han sido incluidos para vender más merchandising, pero son tan adorables, y sus interacciones con el gran Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) son hilarantes. Es imposible escribir sobre “Star Wars” sin mencionar la música del legendario John Williams. Luego de sus composiciones cumplidoras pero decepcionantes para “El despertar de la Fuerza”, en este filme el Maestro ha regresado a lo que mejor sabe hacer: logra mantener un excelente balance entre los temas clásicos de la saga y las composiciones nuevas, muchas de las cuales fueron introducidas de manera muy superficial en el filme anterior, pero que son utilizadas para un mayor efecto en esta nueva cinta.  “Star Wars: Episodio VIII – Los Últimos Jedi” no es necesariamente la obra maestra que muchos fanáticos esperaban, pero funciona gracias a que Johnson se atreve a hacer algo distinto, sorprendente. A diferencia del Episodio VII, no se siente como “Star Wars vintage”; logra desarrollar el conflicto entre la Luz y la Oscuridad de manera ambigua, y manda a nuestros personajes a lugares inesperados (especialmente al trío de Rey, Kylo y Luke). Es una montaña rusa que nos lleva de la tristeza, a la felicidad, y por supuesto, a la sorpresa. Está llena de easter eggs y cameos para los fanáticos, pero debería funcionar también para aquellos que no estén obsesionados con la franquicia.  Esta es una película de Rian Johnson al 100%, y esa es precisamente la razón por la que se siente como un respiro de aire fresco, pero por la que también ya está comenzando a dividir a los fanáticos. Nada será lo mismo después de este episodio; habrá que esperar a ver lo que J.J. Abrams y Chris Terrio logran hacer con lo que Johnson les ha dejado para el Episodio 9. Gran logro. Posiblemente, la mejor entre las tres últimas lanzadas (contando Rogue One, y The Force Awakens). El canon Jedi y el lore del universo se ha expandido. Era hora. Pésimo  guión. Historia disparatada, una princesa Disney que no termina de cuajar con la audiencia infantil femenina o masculina, personajes que no sabemos por qué están ahí con tramas secundarias que no atraen, y un ermitaño miedoso que nos decepcionó  a millones. La pondría en el último lugar de tu ranking. No la salva el humor plasmado en los villanos torpes ni el de los héroes que son aún más torpes. Tampoco entiendo el tratamiento que se le da a los personajes es difícil conseguir otro Han Solo….. Pero aquí ya no queda nadie que nos pueda ilusionar…. Excepto un niño con una escoba. Lamentablemente no se que vieron todos los críticos que he leído en las últimas horas. Soy un fánatico de Star Wars desde hace mas de 40 años, tuve la suerte de vivir el estreno del Episodio IV y enamorarme automáticamente de esa película. Pero después de decepcionarme con Episodio VII y prometer no ver nunca más otra película de la nueva trilogía, mi corazón Starwariano no pudo y ayer fuí al cine para tropezarme con la PEOR película de todas las vistas hasta ahora de la serie Star Wars.
Los críticos dirán que es valiente, diferente, etc etc, pero en realidad es aburrida, absurda en ciertos pasajes, y tratan a personajes icónicos como si fueran segundones sin relevancia.
En fin, deberíamos habernos quedado con la trilogía original, y en todo caso algunos spin off, pero continuar lo que fue maravilloso, para convertirlo en algo más del montón…
GRACIAS DISNEY!!!"
"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE," Things are once again fraught in that galaxy far, far away—but have they ever been otherwise? As in the last Star Wars movie, they're fraught in a familiar way. Like the Rebel Alliance of 40 years ago, the new good-guys collective called The Resistance, led by General Leia Organa (onetime princess Carrie Fisher), is being heavily oppressed by the First Order, a league of space barbarians in no way unlike the Galactic Empire of old, apart from being commanded by a desiccated potato head called Supreme Leader Snoke (a mo-capped Andy Serkis). Can the rebels disrupt the Order's evil scheme of, you know, conquering the entire galaxy? It's not much of a question, but let's say, Who knows? Writer-director Rian Johnson, new to the Star Wars factory, kicks things up more than a notch from J.J. Abrams's welcome-back series reboot, The Force Awakens. Abrams's movie was essentially a reprise—and a pretty good one—of Star Wars' greatest hits. Director Johnson is a more irreverent guy (see his 2012 time-travel movie Looper), and his sequel—""Episode VIII,"" for those keeping count—is quite a bit wittier. We get a lot of the series' trademark swoosh-boom space action, but it doesn't feel like a haphazard CGI dump—now it has some structure, and for the most part it's smartly staged. There are also a few beautiful scenes—on a remote water planet, in Snoke's gleaming black-and-crimson lair. And Johnson has worked up some amusing dialogue as well (a commodity on which Star Wars creator George Lucas was famously short). He gets a couple of out-loud laughs—especially at the expense of Domhnall Gleeson's operatically snotty Snoke subordinate General Hux—but he's careful about it: no one wants to turn the Star Wars franchise into a joke, least of all its Disney overlords. Back from the last film are the series' four new stars: hard-scrabble orphan Rey (Daisy Ridley), in whom The Force is strong; reformed enemy trooper Finn (John Boyega), who has overcome a previous courage deficit; wild-man pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), stepping into the wisecracker slot left empty by the death of Harrison Ford's Han Solo in the previous film; and brooding Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), Han's son and killer, still resident on the Dark Side but deeply conflicted about it. There are also some newbies on hand: Benicio Del Toro as an interstellar codebreaker called DJ; Laura Dern as Amilyn Holdo, Leia's right-hand starship officer; and a tough little mechanic named Rose Tico (TV veteran Kelly Marie Tran). There are also quite a few new creatures, among them various icicle dogs, turtle-face monks, and some impossibly cute thingies called Porgs, which look as if they nest in gift shops at night. The plot isn't exactly full of surprises (there are only so many liberties you can take in blockbuster land), but there's a lot of it. Leia and her shrinking band of rebels are desperately searching for Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the last Jedi Knight—they need his help in summoning the Force to defeat their First Order enemies. Luke has proved hard to find, however—until the resolute Rey tracks him to a remote planet called Ahch-To, where he's living alone with his grizzled beard and his tiny library of ancient Jedi texts. Luke has no interest in helping the rebels, but he's eventually persuaded to train Rey in the Knightly arts. (Cue lightsaber.) Meanwhile, Finn and Rose and the swivel-headed droid BB-8 are off to some sort of Vegas-y casino planet (where BB-8 gets mistaken for a slot machine); and Kylo Ren has taken command of the Order's assault on Leia (his mom!) and her fellow rebels. Johnson has sorted all of this material into an elaborate roundelay that feels endless (the movie is way too long at two and a half hours). Surely sections of the film could have been trimmed—maybe the Laura Dern scenes, which cry out for compression, or the training sequences with Luke and Rey (in which he says things like ""Reach out with your feelings""). On the other hand, it's illuminating to see an actor like Kelly Marie Tran, whose parents are Vietnamese refugees, playing a key role in such a big-bucks movie. (Her presence seems so…natural.) And it's great to see Carrie Fisher, as warm and unmannered as ever, in her final film performance. Fisher died last year, after the movie wrapped, and although she'd been scheduled to appear in the next sequel, the filmmakers have announced that she won't be digitally exhumed for that purpose, in the creepy way that Peter Cushing was for last year's Rogue One.

"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE," Weighing in at nearly 150 minutes, ""Star Wars Episode VIII: The Force Awakens"" may be the longest movie in franchise history, but it's also the fastest moving. Like a Death Star cruising along at Millennium Falcon speed. It waits for no one. All you can do is strap in, grab your arm rests and brace for the ride. Packed with surprises, shocking twists and thunderous set pieces -- with ample humor sprinkled in throughout -- the film is a relentless crowd-pleaser that has as much in common with a pedigreed art film as it does a traditional action blowout. Director Rian Johnson (""Brick,"" ""Looper"") equals the masterful achievement J.J. Abrams mustered with ""The Force Awakens,"" and betters it in some ways by avoiding the formulaic tropes Abrams relied on in that film. This episode has some of the best dialogue exchanges in the series. Johnson's script wickedly twists the laborious mumbo jumbo that conversations about the Force have often devolved to. Health injections of insightful contrarianism and sarcasm do wonders for the verbiage.  Mark Hamill steals all of his scenes, reinhabiting Luke Skywalker as a contankerous curmudgeon, serving as a counterpoint to the wide-eyed farm boy and earnest adventurer he was in the orignal trilogy. Skywalker is one of several characters with complex motivations and buried backstories in the film. The line between light and dark is blurred, providing welcome nuance to a traditionally cut-and-dried sci-fi fantasy epic. Of the three Disney ""Star Wars"" films to date, ""Rogue One"" still holds my heart as the peak, but ""The Last Jedi"" shows that the company is committed to top-shelf curation of the beloved franchise. If ""The Last Jedi"" falls short of ""The Force Awakens"" in any major way, it's that it's all payoff and little setup. While Abrams film set up many tantalizing mysteries for fans to ponder, Johnson's follow-up reveals answers that will satisfy fans without bringing up many new questions to fill up the Reddit forums for the next two years. With the troubled young Han Solo film due out next year, the future of ""Star Wars"" may be cloudy and uncertain, but for now, the Force sure is strong."
"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE," At one point in “The Last Jedi,” a character says “Let the past die.” Which is a funny thing to say in a “Star Wars” movie, where each installment is built firmly upon the architecture of the preceding ones. Last year’s “Rogue One” turned a single line of dialogue from the original 1977 “Star Wars” into its own action movie. Next summer we’re getting a prequel , “Solo,” featuring a younger version of one of the series’ iconic characters. 2015’s Episode VII, “The Force Awakens,” traded heavily on fan nostalgia for the original trilogy, not only bringing back old characters but introducing new characters and story beats that, if they didn’t repeat the original films, at least echoed them. Not to say that “Force Awakens” wasn’t wildly entertaining, or that the nostalgia didn’t work like gangbusters for longtime fans (Fine, I’ll admit to tearing up at the sight of the old Millennium Falcon.) But in Episode VIII, “The Last Jedi,” writer-director Rian Johnson makes a “Star Wars” movie that finally seems ready to move forward, to not let the 40-year history of the franchise weigh it down. The characters, like the movie, take what they need from the past, leave the rest behind, and forge ahead into unexpected and exciting new terrain. And it does it all in a fast-moving, action-packed, emotionally and surprisingly funny movie. In a 152-minute running time, the longest yet for a “Star Wars” film, Johnson (“Looper”) has room for new characters, new relationships, new worlds, new creatures. And if “The Last Jedi” does call back to early movies, it’s sometimes a case of canny misdirection, setting our expectations up for one thing and then delivering another. “The Last Jedi” takes off with the Resistance (good guys) back on its heels, running from the First Order (bad guys) determined to wipe them off the face of the galaxy. As Princess Leia (the late Carrie Fisher), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) try to put some distance between themselves and the villainous General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson going full Snidely Whiplash), Rey (Daisy Ridley) is off trying to coax Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to rejoin the fight after years in self-imposed exile. Looming in the shadows is the wizened Imperial Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and his dark apprentice, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), although Kylo is still wounded both physically and psychically from the events of the last movie. I’m reluctant to reveal more than that of the plot, other than to say that there would be a lot to reveal. Johnson balances heavy dramatic moments with lighter comedic ones, big sweeping space battles with small character moments, the return of familiar faces with the introduction of new ones. If sometimes things move a little too fast for common sense — there always seems to be an escape pod waiting to zip a character exactly where the plot needs them to go — it more or less all hangs together. Of the new characters, the one that makes the most impression is Kelly Marie Tran as Rose, a Resistance maintenance worker who becomes an unlikely hero in the fight. The heroes of “Star Wars” movies have never been generals or princes (okay, one princess). They’re ordinary folk from backwater planets , farmboys and freighter pilots, suddenly thrust into the center of the action when destiny called. There’s a reason why the villains always seem like noblemen, sneering down at the “rebel scum.” “The Last Jedi” hits that theme explicitly, that a hero can come out of nowhere, especially in the film’s poetic final image. It’s an image that looks forward, rather than back, which is exactly the right course that Johnson has set “Star Wars” on for the next installment in 2019.  In the end, “Rogue One” isn’t exactly a necessary addition to the “Star Wars” canon, but it’s well-made and engaging, and will tide us over until “Episode VIII” next year.

"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a visual spectacle that expands our understanding of the Force and how it shapes a ""galaxy far, far away,"" adding to the mythology and lore of this franchise."
"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE," I'm pretty sure this fact has been lost in the big picture industry, so a simple reminder: As an audience, all we want is a good story, something that will stick with us and entertain at the same time.  The Last Jedi, like The Force Awakens, seems to have completely forgotten about this. It  borrows way too much content from the originals, which means we cannot focus on the new story that's being told. Sure, it's looks fabulous, but at what cost? 'A special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing' (Lucas). I know right, the mother of all hypocrites even knew this. Where's the humanity in the script writing? And no mention of the last scene?? The last scene in The Last Jedi is the most corporate thing I've ever seen in a Star War's movie.  It's the'we need the kids to feel included, lets finish with a nod to them' type of mentality that will continue to diminish this much loved saga. I am an original SW fan. The critics have got this right, the fanboys are wrong (again). ""The Last Jedi"" is the greatest of the saga, equal to ""The Empire Strikes Back"". I was open-mouthed with surprise through the entire film, richly entertained and have nothing but admiration for Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy. "
"Dec 15, 2017",NEUTRAL," It’s been 40 years since the original Star Wars came out, 40 years since George Lucas’s game-changing space saga caught a generation of fans – not to mention the movie industry and pop culture in general – in its all-powerful tractor beam. If you were a kid at the time, chances are you’ve stayed there willingly, enduring the dark times – the Ewok spin-off movies, the Botoxed-with-CGI Special Editions, the airless prequels – and breathing a sigh of relief when 2015’s The Force Awakens reminded us that Star Wars movies were supposed to be fun.  That film, directed by JJ Abrams, was more of a remix than a reboot, a canny regurgitation of the first film’s plot with a new and welcome prominence for women and actors of colour in narrative-driving roles. It may have fanned the flames of nostalgia with soaring shots of the Millennium Falcon, but in the midst of all that fan service it also started reckoning with its past by subtly reducing R2-D2 and C-3PO to cameos, keeping Luke Skywalker off-screen until the final seconds and, most audaciously of all, killing off Han Solo.  It was Abrams’ way of acknowledging that formative childhood memories of Star Wars were no longer the exclusive preserve of Generation X, or if you will, Generation X-Wing. Two years on and that mantle has passed to writer/director Rian Johnson, whose last film Looper featured a dizzying time-travel plot in which its protagonist’s past and future selves battled each other for dominance in the present. Not to get too meta about it, but something similar is going on in Star Wars: The Last Jedi.  Picking up pretty much exactly where The Force Awakens left off, the second film in the new trilogy functions in part like a wrecking ball, deliberately tearing down the past, sometimes even more ruthlessly than Abrams did. Hokey mythology is debunked, iconic artefacts are tossed glibly aside and extraneous characters groaningly reintroduced in The Force Awakens are summarily dispatched with barely a cursory mention made of their demise. There are some giddy red herrings too, with shots that feel like obvious set-ups for call-backs to classic moments from The Empire Strikes Back consigned to background texture and facetious humour undercutting the pomp of the evil First Order and the reverence for Luke Skywalker’s own exalted status in the series. The latter is certainly useful for addressing how to reintroduce of him. Played once more by Mark Hamill, his greying, bearded, melancholic appearance at the end of The Force Awakens suggested he’d become a mystical old hermit – like Obi-Wan Kenobi without the gravitas of Alec Guinness. In truth he’s more like Yoda at his crankiest, a legend-scorning weirdo living in exile on a barely habitable rock.  Spending his days scowling, catching over-sized fish and ruing his own past hubris, specifically his failed attempt to train his nephew Ben Solo in the ways of the force (and thus helping birth Darth Vader wannabe Kylo Ren in the process), it’s small wonder that he has little time for Daisy Ridley’s Rey. She, of course, was the one who felt the force awaken last time around.  Those fearing a remix of The Empire Strikes Back won’t be dissuaded by this development, nor by the splitting up of the principal players in the various narrative strands, or indeed a later battle attack by AT-AT Walkers on a salt-encrusted (but also snowbound) rebel base.  But Johnson keeps things fresh as well, drawing new connections in weird and interesting ways and introducing a few more new characters into the mix to ensure you barely notice the casual way he’s sidelining old favourites like Chewbacca.  Among the latter are Laura Dern’s Vice Admiral Holdo – a military commander for the Resistance whose presence challenges the patriarchal assumptions of hotshot X-Wing pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) – and Rose, a shy maintenance operative for the Resistance who gets a little star-struck when she meets rogue-stormtrooper-turned-Resistance-hero Finn (John Boyega). Rose’s introduction in particular once again emphasises the way these films are subtly (and not so subtly) changing the make-up of the Star Wars universe.  Played by Vietnamese-American actress Kelly Marie Tran, she’s the heart of the new film the way Boyega was in The Force Awakens and, even though the mission they embark upon feels a little surplus to requirements in an already jam-packed film, they’re more interesting to hang out with than some of the more established characters whose adventures we’ve seen in their prime. Which isn’t to say Johnson hasn’t found a way to pay fitting tribute to the late Carrie Fisher, who passed away a year ago this Christmas, but whose work on the film was already finished. Her big moment in The Last Jedi at first seems in danger of being a little goofy, but it ends up being incredibly moving through the sheer force of Fisher’s star presence and the depth of feeling any self-respecting Star Wars fan can’t help but have for Princess Leia.  It’s also a moment buoyed elsewhere in the film by a destined-to-be iconic shot of Leia silhouetted against a setting sun, something that demonstrates the extent to which Johnson – like George Lucas before him – has an eye for capturing epic moments that simultaneously feel effortless and throwaway. But not everything feels so casually brilliant. The spine of the film is the connection between the light and dark side of the Force respectively embodied by Rey and the patricidal, newly battle-scarred Kylo Ren (Adam Driver).  He’s repeatedly demeaned by his master, Supreme Leader Snoke, who scalds him for being beaten by a girl in his previous encounter with Rey and goes on to dismiss him as little more than child with a helmet, which is a bit rich given Snoke looks like Freddy Krueger stuffed inside an hourglass (he’s played by Andy Serkis, motion-captured as per usual).  It’s Kylo Ren who thus becomes obsessed with destroying the past. “That’s the only way to become what you’re meant to be,” he says, ominously.  Alas, while the film follows through on this extremist attitude with some unexpected plot twists, those twists also feel as mechanical as Luke’s right hand. In short, they feel like try-hard attempts to deliver something, anything, that might replicate the shock-and-awe of the big reveals in The Empire Strikes Back because that’s what’s expected in the second instalment of a Star Wars trilogy.  As skilled as Johnson is, it’s hard to escape the notion that The Last Jedi represents another first generation fanboy filmmaker wrestling with what Star Wars meant to him as a child (a perspective we’ve already had from Abrams and will get again when he concludes the series). And yet Johnson does leave it at an intriguing place.  A final series of images not only suggests everything is in position for a new generation to make Star Wars their own, it also gives older fans permission to start gracefully ageing out of the saga. After 40 years, I’m OK with the latter. "
"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE," There are feats of derring-do, spectacular aerial battles, brave souls willing to make the supreme sacrifice, fantastic beasts, betrayal, death and a great deal more of Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker.  Finn (John Boyega) is deciding where his loyalties lie and even finding a touch of (very chaste) romance with fighter pilot Rose (Kelly Marie Tran).  Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) appears to have assumed the Han Solo role of hot-headed, daredevil pilot and fearless defender of Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and her ever-dwindling Resistance forces.  The film is fittingly dedicated to the late Carrie Fisher who invests Princess Leia with a weary melancholy as those around her continue to fall and all hope seems lost.  Kylo may have killed his own father but Rey believes that there is a goodness in him that can still be reached whereas Kylo believes Rey could be tempted towards the dark side, especially if he offered to share the galaxy with her.  There is a great deal going on in The Last Jedi and the way it splits off the main characters into separate but intertwined stories makes for a long, over-plotted fi lm that even starts to drag a little in the middle.  But when all those elements come together for a rip-roaring, heart-in-the-mouth final showdown, you realise that it has all been worthwhile and has been heading towards a greater purpose. "
"Dec 15, 2017",NEUTRAL," The following piece of criticism will include the discussion of plot points and the fates of characters; please do not complain to me about spoilers if you read beyond this sentence. The Last Jedi feels cobbled together from bits and pieces of The Empire Strikes Back and The Return of the Jedi: we get training sequences in a remote location headed by a reticent Jedi master; we get trench battles featuring hopelessly outnumbered rebels facing down AT-ATs; we get a final duel in the throne room of a star ship as a hero of the Alliance watches her fleet be destroyed, her allies snuffed out hundreds at a time. And I probably could have lived with that, to be totally honest, if it wasn't for the fact that writer/director Rian Johnson also borrows from the prequel trilogy's shoddier storytelling impulses and action set pieces. Our heroes are divided into three plotlines. The Resistance is on the run (again) and the Empire remnant the First Order has laid claim to the Galaxy (again) following the destruction of the Republic (again). The First Order has recuperated remarkably quickly, given the fact that its Starkiller base was just blown to hell; an entire fleet of Star Destroyers pops above the planet Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) are trying to evacuate. Needless to say, the Resistance makes its escape (again), and when Finn (John Boyega) awakens from the coma we left him in at the end of Force Awakens he discovers that the First Order is not only on their tail still but able to track them through hyperspace. (How has this one foolproof escape hatch present throughout every other Star Wars movie been nullified? Oh, it doesn't matter. Science, or something.) In order to slip the First Order once and for all, Finn and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) must travel to a casino planet and find a hacker who can get them aboard Supreme Leader Snoke's (Andy Serkis) flagship, which will allow them to deactivate the tracking device and let the remnant of the Resistance flee to safety. Rey (Daisy Ridley), meanwhile, picks up where we last saw her on Ahch-To: she's handing Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) his lightsaber, ready for her training. But he's just not that into her, having sworn off the whole Jedi thing and closed his mind to the Force. Needless to say, like his master before him, Luke relents and does some modest amount of training before Rey, frustrated by her lack of progress and annoyed at his unwillingness to rejoin the fight, leaves to try and turn Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) back to the light side of the Force. The best parts of The Last Jedi revolve around Rey, Luke, and Kylo, around the mental connection shared by Rey and Kylo, around Luke's feelings of failure and his inability to keep Kylo from succumbing to the dark side, around Kylo's anger at living in the shadow of his grandfather and his uncle. Rey and Kylo have real chemistry—that is, there seems to be a mutual attraction, even as they struggle against each other's plans—unlike Rey and Finn, who hug so awkwardly and platonically at the film's end you'd think they were coworkers worried about getting slapped with a #MeToo complaint from Leia's HR department. Unfortunately, we keep getting dragged away from the only emotionally resonant portion of the film to watch Finn and Rose engage in sub-prequel hijinks on the casino planet. Everything here is forced and awful, visually uninteresting and often dark to the point of unwatchability, lousy with mawkish little kids making bug eyes at the camera as we marvel at the horror of economic inequality, and drowned in an atrocious patina of truly terrible CGI. It calls to mind the droid factory in Attack of the Clones and the pre-podrace sequence in The Phantom Menace. Most offensively, the whole Finn/Rose diversion has absolutely no importance to the forward momentum of the plot—it's utterly irrelevant, even nonsensical.* By constantly yanking us away from Rey and Kylo, their showdown with Snoke loses any resonance it might have had. We know nothing of Snoke, nothing of his plans and plots, his hopes and desires. We have no idea why he's so angry. All we know is that he … is kind of gross looking. And strong in the Force. There's nothing to motivate him and therefore nothing for us to care about when he meets his fate; he's your standard-issue, MCU-style, evil CGI/motion capture construct. He's a twirling mustache brought to life. Also—and this is a peeve that might not resonate with some of you but it vexed me greatly—Johnson tries too hard on the humor front. Just one, brief, example: The whole opening sequences involves Poe doing conference call shtick while trolling Admiral Hux (Domhnall Gleeson). It's weirdly un-Star-Wars in the sense that it feels like something you could see on any dreadful sitcom here on planet Earth; this sequence is more fit for The Big Bang Theory than a supposedly dark entry in the Star Wars canon. The Star Wars movies have always been funny, of course, and there are moments when Johnson makes it work in a Star-Wars-sort-of-way (I'd watch a whole spinoff about the put-upon Jedi nuns who live on Ahch-To and have to clean up after Luke and Rey). On the whole, though, it feels desperate and forced. *So, the whole reason, from a plot structure point of view, to get Finn, Rose, and the hacker on Snoke's ship is to have the hacker betray the Resistance to the First Order. Which, okay, fine: there's something interesting in this whole bit about shades of gray and it's nice to see our heroes fail at literally anything for once. Except, there's no way** the hacker in question would have known about the Resistance's plan to escape to the mineral planet—they were captured before Poe discovered what Admiral Effie Trinket (Laura Dern) was up to—or that the ships in question were cloaked. My point is not so much to scream ""PLOT HOLE!!1!!1"" as to ask why, in this 2.5-hour movie, we spend 30 minutes on something with no narrative impact whatsoever? Why are we taken away again and again from something more emotionally compelling (Rey/Kylo/Luke, yes, but also Poe/Leia/Effie) for this sub-Star-Wars-cartoon interlude? You know why we don't really care about Snoke's croak, why it feels so weightless? Because the time we could have spent learning to hate him—or learning literally anything about him, since there is no big reveal, no secret identity: Snoke is just Snoke—was wasted on the two shittiest, most boring characters in the entirety of Star Wars history: Rose and Finn. **[update] On second viewing, there's a shot where the hacker is seen overhearing Finn and Poe talking about the plan. (Must have missed it taking notes the first time; my bad.) Again, though, the point wasn't so much to scream PLOT HOLE PLOT HOLE as to ask why we were wasting so much time on this subplot when it did nothing to move the action forward and turned what should be exciting space fantasy into a boring, overlong slog."
"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE," “This is not going to go the way you think.” Crabbily spat at his new apprentice, Mark Hamill’s line is a pithy summation of The Last Jedi, arguably the most original and surprising entry in the series to date. Rian Johnson’s film is the real deal: a bold, risky venture unafraid to tell its own story, freed from the weight of nostalgia and formula. For the first time since The Empire Strikes Back, we have a Star Wars film that truly feels like it’s about something. Themes of legacy and forging one’s own path run deeply through Johnson’s film, and in the context of widespread inter-generational conflict, The Last Jedi is perhaps the most political space opera yet. Being the middle-child of the new trilogy, comparisons to The Empire Strikes Back are all but inevitable. And both in tone and structure there are plenty of similarities. True to form, our heroes find themselves strewn across the galaxy – flyboy Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and General Leia (Carrie Fisher) waging a desperate fight against the resurgent First Order, while Finn (John Boyega), fresh from a regenerative bacta bath, takes off on a secret mission with newcomer Rose (Kelly Marie Tran). However, the meat of the story is with Rey. Picking up immediately after the ending of The Force Awakens, this portion of the story is where the real surprises lie. Undercutting the cathartic, somewhat portentous tone of the last film’s climax, Luke has gone full hermit, a cranky old man disconnected from the affairs of the galaxy. Where Obi-Wan and Yoda before him waited patiently for a new hope to reignite the Jedi order, Luke is all but ready to let the embers die. Hamill has expressed reservation at this direction of the onetime idealist Skywalker, but in truth, it’s arguably his finest screen performance and a movingly bittersweet portrayal of a man broken by failure. Meanwhile, the conflict in Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) has been steadily building. Killing his father was supposed to consolidate Kylo’s passage to the dark side, yet it seems only to have stalled it. A moment hinted at in the trailers signifies yet more hesitation in the man-who-would-be-Vader. Driver, as with all the young cast, builds on his superb work in the previous instalment, giving us easily the most complex villain in the series. Obsessed with the legacy of Vader, his childish attempts at emulating the sith lord chime more with the bratty whining of Anakin Skywalker, yet the fight for the soul of Ben Solo is infinitely more compelling than the hamfisted conflict of the prequels. Not everything in the film works: a few of the goofier comic moments fail to land and true to the legacy of Lucas there’s a fair amount of eye-wincing dialogue. More importantly, the second act bows under the weight of too many narrative strands; Finn’s away mission comes off as a bit superfluous, as does Laura Dern’s Vice Admiral Hold, and both Rose and the beloved Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) are sadly underwritten. In a trade-off that brings scope and complexity, Johnson has sacrificed narrative efficiency. Nevertheless, this is bold, original filmmaking to be judged on its own merits rather than those of its forbears, with The Last Jedi confirming Rian Johnson’s status as a consummate filmmaker. J.J. Abrams has certainly got his work cut out for him with his upcoming Episode IX because The Last Jedi is on target to being the best Star Wars picture of this generation."
"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE," When was the last time a movie brought you to your knees? It doesn’t happen too often, but when it does, it reminds us why we put ourselves through this at all -- surrender ourselves to strangers and their vision. There is a certain amount of trust involved, but it’s something more than that, something more sacred, more intangible. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a rewarding experience for anyone who has stuck with this venerable series through thick and thin. But for the uninitiated, it could prove to be just as enjoyable as being held in a Force Choke for two-and-a-half-hours. I didn’t grow up with these movies – mine is the Harry Potter generation. I discovered them, like the rest of my friends, years later on TV. I have only the faintest memories of the frenzy that accompanied the release of The Phantom Menace in 1999, but I was too young to understand what all the fuss was about. But no one forgets the first time they watch A New Hope – it’s like the first time you listen to the Beatles, or like the first time you’re confronted by the Mona Lisa. The Last Jedi will not win any new converts – by now, you’re either in or you’re out, and even if you’re on the fence, you’re hardly going to jump in with the eighth movie – but it will be just the elixir those having a crisis of faith need. Like Luke Skywalker, who has been living a monk-like existence on Ahch-To – an island that is home to the oldest Jedi temple in the galaxy, where we last saw him in the final scene of The Force Awakens – resigned to the future he has decided for himself. He lives out his days in isolation, occasionally yelling at animals, but mostly keeping to himself, biding his time until he dies, away from his family and his duty. Having lost his nephew and protege Kylo Ren to the Dark Side, Luke denounced his religion. In death, he hopes to take with him what remains of the Jedi, refusing to accept that for thousands of rebels, he is their last hope, the only one powerful enough to stop Supreme Leader Snoke. The Last Jedi picks up right where the Force Awakens left off, on that mountain top on Ahch-To, with Rey offering Luke his lightsabre, a symbol from his past, a plea for help, and a sign of things to come. But if there’s ever a moment that will define what kind of movie The Last Jedi is going to be, it is the moment we’ve waited two years to see – on that mountaintop, Rey reaching out to the man who has been deified since his disappearance. In Luke’s reaction to coming face to face with Rey, director Rian Johnson announces the sort of movie he has made – a funny, foreboding and deeply spiritual story of one family, torn apart by the sins of the father. The Skywalker Saga owes a great debt to Eastern philosophy – most notably Buddhist, Taoist and Hindu texts – but for some reason, after having alluded to it in the original trilogy, creator George Lucas curiously shied away from the very thought of thematic heft in his much derided prequels. The Force, a metaphysical idea that binds the Star Wars universe together was sidelined in favour of something more scientific, and altogether less fun. With The Force Awakens – a movie I love just as much as The Last Jedi, but for different reasons – director JJ Abrams paid due reverence to these concepts, which, for an entire generation of Star Wars fans, were sacred. And Johnson, while adding his own unique voice to the Saga, has continued the pilgrimage. He takes his time with the story, carefully peppering smaller character moments within the grander scheme of things, aided by his film school buddy and cinematographer Steve Yedlin’s distinct visuals, some fluid editing by Bob Ducsay, and a propulsive score by the legendary John Williams. Even at two-and-a-half-hours long – it’s the longest movie in the series, by the way – there isn’t a minute wasted. Everything is in service of the characters – Rey, Finn, Kylo, Poe, Leia and others – men, women and droids we’ve come to care for. For what is Star Wars but a story about family? What is it but a story about hope? It’s about seeing light when there is only darkness. It is about how, when faced with peril, even the most rational of us bow our heads and pray. But what are we praying for? Whom are we praying to? Why must we have faith, when all we see is death and destruction – in real life, as with the galaxy far, far away. There are no easy answers, not even in Star Wars. But as one character says towards the end of the film, we mustn’t destroy what we hate, we must save what we love."

FILM REVIEW – STAR WARS EPISODE VIII: THE LAST JEDI. With Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Mark Hamill, Adam Driver, Carrie Fisher. Written and directed by Rian Johnson. Rated PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi action and violence.. 152 minutes. The “Star Wars” franchise turned 40 this year. It’s telling that George Lucas’s two greatest contributions to the series may have been, first, creating it, and then selling it off. Certainly the offerings since the 2015 reboot of the series with “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” has helped fans forget the dreadful “prequels” which have a place in the hearts of most fans only slightly higher in the canon than the “Star Wars Christmas Special.” “The Force Awakens” had its plusses and minuses, but for the most part was a strong effort to move the story forward. While Disney – which now owns the franchise – is trying to turn out a “Star Wars” film every year, they are creatively offering films that branch off from the series rather than attempting to do a new chapter every year. Thus last year’s “Rogue One” was a true prequel, a story set just before the events of the original “Star Wars,” and a story focusing on Han Solo is due next year. This year, though, brings us STAR WARS EPISODE VIII: THE LAST JEDI. In answer to the first question people have: yes, you need to see “The Force Awakens” before you see this. Picking up where that story left off, the film follows two storylines. In one, General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher, in her final role), is leading the remnants of the Resistance in escape after a devastating attack by the First Order, the successors to the bad guys of the original trilogy. Among her crew are Finn (John Boyega), a former Stormtrooper who defected from the Empire, and Poe (Oscar Isaac), a hotshot fighter pilot who doesn’t always follow orders. Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley), has tracked down the long-missing Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), now a much older, much grumpier version of the callow youth of the original series, hoping to be trained as a Jedi Knight. All of them are working to the purpose of resisting and defeating Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who follows the “dark side” of the Force (and happens to be the son of Leia and Han). Rey, who has a mysterious link to Kylo, believes he can be redeemed. In terms of plot, that’s really all you need to know – and, perhaps, want to know – going in. The resulting film will more than satisfy fans in spite of, and maybe even because of, things we come to expect. Yes, there’s a variation of the cantina scene from the original “Star Wars,” but on a much grander scale than previously depicted. And when Finn and Rose (newcomer Kelly Marie Tran) have to deactivate a tracking device, it is through as convoluted a process as possible. On the other hand, there are moments of great invention, and some surprising new cast members, some of whom one hopes will return for “Episode IX” (tentatively scheduled for release in December 2019). There’s also some welcome humor, often when least expected. What’s clear with “The Last Jedi” is that the people at the helm now have found their footing, and are taking their inheritance seriously but are not afraid to break new ground. That seems to have been Lucas’s problem with his prequels – digging in rather than thinking about what might happen next. If “The Last Jedi” has a main flaw it’s that it’s too long at just over two-and-a-half hours. When the film is cross-cutting between the escape of the Resistance and the showdown with Snoke, one might assume this was the climax of the film. In fact, there’s much more to come. Daniel M. Kimmel is a veteran movie critic and author of a host of film-related books, including Jar Jar Binks Must Die. His latest novel is Time on My Hands: My Misadventures in Time Travel. He lives in Somerville, Massachusetts. How the hell can all of you critics leave all these reviews praising this movie as if it was the best in all of star wars?! It makes me think all you were paying attention to was the visual effects and didnt consider all the holes the movie left in the franchise. Who was snoke? How powerful was he? How did he get into power? Well i guess we’ll never know because he got sliced in half before we got any information about him at all! Anyone who actually payed attention to this movie would have realized that they now know nothing more than they did after the force awakens, this movie added nearly nothing in the grand scheme of the star wars franchise and the fact you could’nt see that tells me you should not have a job as a critic. Anyone who was actually paying attention to Episode VII would realize this was taking place a number of years after the events of the original trilogy (Leia and Han have an adult son – hello?) and that a number of details about the interim were going to be glossed over or ignored.  Actually we learn a number of things about what’s become of the Jedi, the Empire, and the Resistance.  Next time you might focus on the story the filmmakers are telling rather than the one you wanted them to tell instead. You are a turd… you are such a turd. You’re pissed because the new films aren’t following along with your childhood fantasy of what Star Wars should be… so you spoil a major point for those who haven’t seen the film yet. Way to go guy, way to go. The original trilogy didn’t answer these types of questions at first either.  Who was the Emperor?  How powerful was he and how did he get into power?  If you didn’t read the material around the movies, you didn’t know that at the time either.  No, no one has to see The Force Awakens in order to appreciate or not appreciate Return of The Jedi. Except that the Disney Cognitive Dictatorship pretty much demands that you do. Laura Dern, IMO, put her considerable acting skills on display NOT in the movie but on The Tonight Show when claiming she was such a fan of the franchise she didn’t realize she was saying “pew pew”out loud on the set as blaster sound effects were going off. Pew pew seemed to be her way of saying STAY AWAY & whatever you do don’t stare at the droid-like zombie audience sitting in their seats looking at the screen as if in coma or machine shutdown. Return of The Jedi has me agreeing with such as Ross Douthat movie reviewer of the conservative Nat’l Review. Hey, it happens. No big deal it’s just a movie. TLJ is the worst of all the Star Wars films. Gaping plot holes, illogical actions, nonsensical  character ‘development’, idiotic dialogue, failed attempts at ‘humor’ and a lazy copy and paste of many elements / scenes from episodes 5 & 6. I miss George Lucas."
"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE," If “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” was partially a look back to help reignite the franchise, then “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” definitely advances the shape of this vaunted galaxy far, far away. At the fadeout of “The Force Awakens,” Rey (Daisy Ridley) had found the legendary Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), wordlessly and reverently offering him his lightsaber. Luke and Rey’s journey is just one of the numerous threads writer-director Rian Johnson has weaved for his many characters — some familiar, some old and some new. Hot-headed and cocky fighter pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaacs) learns some bitter truths about war, while former storm trooper Finn (John Boyega), awakened from his coma, finds a new mission and a new friend in shy repair person Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran). The most fascinating character, though, is Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren aka, Ben Solo, who was lured to the dark side of The Force by Supreme Leader Snoke, and, who killed his father, Han (Harrison Ford), in “The Force Awakens.” Driver’s character is the most complex. He bears outer scars from his encounter with Rey and inner demons over his conflicted feelings about turning to the dark side. Kylo Ren and Rey form a connection that is at the heart of “The Last Jedi.” Rey believes good still exists in Ben Solo and works to turn him back to the light — to the forces of good. You know what? Forget about the story. It’s the movie’s themes of redemption and hope that make “The Last Jedi” a memorable entry in the “Star Wars” canon, nearly on par with “The Empire Strikes Back.” Tran’s character is the conscience of the film, reminding Finn that you don’t win a revolution by hating your enemy, but by loving your comrades. The screen comes alive when Rose and her bubbly personality are in a scene. She is Johnson’s metaphor for the hope that seems to be diminishing as the rebel forces are continually assailed and outgunned by the massive might of the fascistic First Order. Hamill transforms his once-unwavering farm boy into an old man who looks back on his life with disappointment and a feeling of failing all those he loved. Johnson stages one memorable scene with Luke and a very old friend sitting on a rocky ledge on Luke’s island hideaway, and the screen drips with a mixture of nostalgia and melancholy. And then there is the late Carrie Fisher. How her presence will be missed in the final episode of this trilogy. Fisher had transformed Leia from a feisty princess to a wise and war-weary general, mourning every soldier lost in battle, yet steeling herself to continue the fight until the bitter end. As usual, the movie’s special effects are superb, offering new planets — desolate and gaudy — and creatures — the birdlike Porgs and a tribe of crystal-like dogs. Also, it is refreshing to see so many women on the screen. Not only in major and supporting roles such as Ridley, Tran and Gwendoline Christie’s Captain Phasma, but as pilots flying, rebel ships and manning consoles on rebel and First Order vessels. Johnson’s finale may seem bleak. Yet he offers a sliver of hope — there’s that word again — as he assures us, when the screen fades to dark, that brighter days are ahead. We just have to wait another two years to see what comes of it. Before that, you can see “The Last Jedi” a few times, and hope the calendar flies at light speed until December 2019.

"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE," When the Star Wars franchise returned to screens two years ago with The Force Awakens, a consensus soon emerged about J.J. Abrams’ film: It was exciting, with some great moments, and a huge improvement over George Lucas’ misbegotten prequels. But at the same time, it felt like a beat-for-beat remake of the original 1977 Star Wars. I like the movie a lot, it’s far superior to the prequels and it holds up well on repeat viewings, but yes: it follows the A New Hope template almost to a fault. And that’s part of why director Rian Johnson’s second film in the sequel trilogy, The Last Jedi, is a triumph. It takes the number of amazing moments from Force Awakens and multiplies it by a factor of two or three. It demonstrates an understanding of the Star Wars universe and its appeal, while also taking it into wonderful new directions. It skillfully combines old characters and new, while juggling a notably huge cast. Diehards will find things to love, as will little kids who play with toys. And best of all, it gives us things we’ve been waiting decades to see. The Last Jedi shares a few structural traits with The Empire Strikes Back, starting with an overall sense of doom and gloom and the bad guys seemingly having the upper hand. But at the same time, it transcends what came before. This is a great film. The Last Jedi picks up immediately after the events of The Force Awakens, within the very familiar galactic civil war between the successors of the Rebel Alliance (“The Resistance”) and the Empire (“the First Order”). Young heroine Rey (Daisy Ridley) is on a distant planet, seeking to engage the legendary, long-missing Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Meanwhile, the tantrum-prone bad guy Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) battles his allies, enemies, and himself, as the two sides in the war engage in a series of epic space battles. Without revealing too much, I can say this: There is much consideration of legacies, destinies, the shadows of the past, and other frequent themes of the Star Wars saga. There’s equal parts humor, action, and visual highlights. The plot is probably the most twisted of any Star Wars movie to date. And there are some really special moments, including one that drew audible calls of “holy shit” from a large portion of my preview audience. The beating heart of the film, though, is Hamill, playing Luke Skywalker for, if you don’t count his brief, silent, Force Awakens cameo, the first time since The Return of the Jedi in 1983. Hamill plays Luke as bitter older man, scarred by the past; he’s clearly aged into a similar character as Alec Guinness’ Obi Wan Kenobi at the time of the first film. It’s a tremendous, lived-in performance; a lot of people used to mock the young Hamill’s acting, but he’s a confident, assured performer. It’s also, somewhat poignantly, the final screen performance by Carrie Fisher, to whom the film is dedicated. She gets a couple of fine moments herself, including one in which she’s beautifully, eerily floating through space. As for the younger characters let us praise the casting of these films, as there’s not a single Hayden Christiansen among any of the principals. Driver perfectly captures the vulnerability of this most unique of villains, while Ridley acquits herself just as well as in the first film. Of the new characters, the standout is Kelly Marie Tran as Rose, a Resistance member with a tragic backstory. Johnson, who also wrote the script, shows himself the most capable of the directors to take the Star Wars mantle in the Disney era; he’s also, it’s worth noting, one of the few not fired or replaced at any phrase of the production, and he’s reportedly being entrusted with more Star Wars films in the future. You can tell this is a movie he’s waited much of his life to make, and he doesn’t blow his opportunity. Oddly enough, I’ve never especially admired Johnson’s previous films, Brick, The Brothers Bloom and Looper; I thought all of them significantly overrated, although Johnson did direct some of the greatest episodes of Breaking Bad, including the legendary final season installment “Ozymandias.”"
"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE,"""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" reminds us all over again why this franchise is so beloved."
"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE,"I can say that the film is visually spectacular, with another superb soundtrack from John Williams, and mostly well cast."
"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE," Whatâs most striking about Rian Johnsonâs Star Wars: The Last Jedi, first and foremost, is the speed of the damn thing. Itâs the longest Star Wars movie to date, clocking in at around two and a half hours, but it doesnât feel like it; it whizzes by, breathlessly, from the very first shot. And this is, after all, a franchise that famously began with the image of a giant spaceship cruising â crawling, really â past a locked-down camera; The Last Jedi begins with the camera plunging through space, hurtling towards a planet, whose sky soon fills with ships coming out of lightspeed, appearing intact like bubbles on an old episode of Pop-Up Video. The entire movie runs at that clip, and with that intensity. Just as the first film in this sequel trilogy, 2015âs The Force Awakens closely followed the beats and style of the original 1977 installment, The Last Jedi takes its cues from that filmâs follow-up, The Empire Strikes Back. But it doesnât feel slavish in the way that the (still enjoyable) Force Awakens did; there are broad echoes and analogous plot points, but for the most part, Johnson (who also penned the script) was apparently free to move the franchise in new directions, with thrilling results. As with Empire, the narrative is somewhat scattered. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is rediscovered on that nowhere island, at the moment she hands the lightsaber to Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamil), with a clever payoff. Reyâs battle with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) has left him vulnerable, in the eyes of Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), who admonishes him, âAlas, youâre no Vader. Youâre just a child in a mask.â Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) are trying to figure out how to save the last remnants of the Resistance, which is confined to a single starship, with Ren and the First Order in pursuit. And for reasons unclear, the Force has formed a kind of telekinetic connection between Ren and Rey, who is still trying to puzzle out her âplaceâ in all this. This sequel series is very much about the passing of batons, so it makes sense for Luke to move into the Yoda/Obi-Wan role of the wise old master/hermit. But he has no interest in that role, and Reyâs journey proves more complicated than his; there was never really a question, even when Vader explicitly posed it, of Luke succumbing to the Dark Side. But here, the push-pull between good and evil is made real â for both Rey and Ren. The visualization of that inner conflict is one of the many moments in which Johnson gets to shine. âWhat do you see?â Luke asks her, and the answers are single words, ideas, seen in flash cuts â a look and style altogether unfamiliar to the Star Wars aesthetic. Yet itâs a welcome addition to the visual language of the series. Heâs easily the most skilled filmmaker to ever helm one of these â itâs not even close â and itâs not just that the film has a surface beauty of its own. (Though it does; thereâs a particular story turn thatâs complemented with a tableaux as simultaneously gorgeous and thrilling as any in recent memory.) Heâs aware of what we expect narratively from a Star Wars movie, and delights in subverting it. The performers, too, come to play. The Last Jedi seems to find Domhnall Gleesonâs General Hux ridiculous in a way The Force Awakens did not, and itâs a better call; the actor really leans into the original trilogyâs sweaty, nefarious, pasty Brit villain thing. Benicio del Toro pops in briefly, in a turn that can best be summarized by Graham Chapman exclaiming âWhat an eccentric performance!â in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The emotional heft of Carrie Fisherâs last appearance as Leia was at least partially unintentional, but is nonetheless affecting. And Hamill, never really trumpeted as the seriesâ finest actor, is wonderful â bitter and weary, in a way that (as with Ford in the previous film) bears the weight of carrying this iconic character around with him for four decades. If The Last Jedi is too long â and maybe it is â itâs a question of abundance, of a writer/director so inspired by the richness of this world that he worked up a full plate of great ideas, and couldnât bear to part with any of them. There are multiple sequences here that wouldâve been the highlight of any single film; Johnson keeps bringing them on, finding new ways to dazzle us, move us, charm us. And while itâs a very funny movie (in that off-hand way the original films were, mostly via Han Solo) Johnson also treats this world as mythology, stories of gods and monsters, mortals and legends. Which is why its epilogue feels, counter-intuitively enough, like the most personal thing heâs ever made."
"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE," The Resistance is on the run. After their successful assault on the Starkiller base, General Leia Organa’s (Carrie Fisher) forces must now evacuate their current hideout before General Hux’s (Domhnall Gleeson) First Order armada arrives to wipe them out for good. But while the plan instigated by Leia’s most trusted commander Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) buys her escaping ships precious time, it does so at a massive, unforeseen cost that will make defending their small fleet difficult as their flight to a new base continues. Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley) has arrived at the ancient Jedi temple where Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has been hiding for the past thirty years. She expects that the sight of his father’s old lightsaber, plus the appearance of the Millennium Falcon and old friends Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and R2-D2 (Jimmy Vee), will be enough to convince him to return and assist the Resistance in their time of need. At the very least, the young woman hopes the Master Jedi will help her understand why she is so strong with the Force and that he will give her an insight into her abilities that might keep her from heading down the same path of darkness that is slowly destroying First Order firebrand, and Luke’s nephew, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). As we journey back into an intergalactic world begun by George Lucas in 1977, it’s best not to know too much about the basics walking into Star Wars: The Last Jedi. The eighth installment in the saga intimately connected to Luke Skywalker and his kin, picking up immediately after the events of 2015’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens came to an end, writer/director Rian Johnson’s (Looper, Brick) entry goes out of its way to bust convention and expectation whenever and wherever it can. Unlike the last film, this one uses nostalgia and one’s knowledge of this universe against the viewer, ideas as to what can happen, who can and cannot survive and where things go from here as they head into the ninth and final chapter blown into smithereens like a fourth Death Star. All of which makes Johnson’s film the most challenging Star Wars motion picture ever made, and this includes Platoon meets The Dirty Dozen spinoff Rogue One: A Star Wars Story which has already significantly changed the game all on its own just last December. The director takes Luke into territory just about no one saw coming, making him a lone samurai full of heartache and regret more akin to heroes in Akira Kurosawa’s Yojimbo or Kagemusha than he is the dashing young champion of something like The Hidden Fortress. His interactions with Rey are the heart and soul of the film, his evolved understanding of the Force, the Jedi and what is best for the universe as a whole not exactly comforting. This is coupled with the fight-or-flight debate that rages within the Resistance, Poe and Leia butting heads as her view as to what is best for their forces significantly differs from his. This allows for an intriguing examination of what constitutes heroism. It also leads to a number of fantastic and fascinating variations on what is, and for that matter what isn’t, sacrifice. A number of Resistance fighters give their lives in a variety of ways, most of them selflessly and with valor. But when does hubris come into play? When is sending others into battle for a victory now only setting the stage for defeat later on? It is the balance between these two that is the debate, and much like Christopher Nolan so deftly explored with Dunkirk, Johnson’s film spends a great deal of time showing how survival during retreat can be the greatest form of heroism that will inspire others to rise up and join in the fight. All of which makes this hardly the Star Wars most fans are used to. Even The Empire Strikes Back didn’t feel this bleakly serious, and while the bad guys did well in that 1980 classic, it was still clear to all watching that Luke, Han and Leia would find a way to lead the Rebel Alliance to victory sooner rather than later. Here, while this is certainly Rey’s story going forward, while it is obvious Poe, ex-Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) and newcomer Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) will be the face of the Resistance as Luke and Leia are pushed to the background, the idea that they all will make it through to the end of 2019’s final chapter is an open question. Not that Johnson has gone all that far away from Lucas’ original template. As dark as things get, as dangerous as it becomes for Rey, especially as she figures out what there is to know about Kylo Ren and whether or not the emotionally self-destructive son of Han Solo and Leia Organa can be redeemed, her journey still isn’t without humor, energy and wide-eyed excitement. All of the stuff between her and Luke is incredibly strong, their conversations the foundation upon which everything else in the movie is built upon. A delightful energy fuels their scenes together, all of which allows the story’s climax to resonate with a startling, unexpected power it never would have been able to achieve without their combined efforts. As for the rest, much of it works splendidly, most notably an effervescent jaunt away from the retreating fleet by Finn and Rose as they attempt to find a cybernetic genius (intriguingly played by suitably mysterious Benicio Del Toro) key to helping the Resistance escape from the First Order. But the actual retreat itself? As well-acted as these sections are, as key the moments between Poe, Leia and the quiet, intellectually astute Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern) prove to be, there is a turgid, melodramatic awkwardness to some of these conversations that can grow a little tiresome. It’s as if Johnson watched a bunch of Stanley Kramer classics like On the Beach or Judgment in Nuremberg and felt the need compose high-minded debates that echo those the nine-time Oscar nominee was undeniably most known for, and as such there were moments where I felt I was being lectured to by these characters more than I was anything else. Even so, if it wasn’t obvious after the technical virtuosity of his three low budget gems Brick, The Brothers Bloom and Looper, Johnson has only gotten better with every outing as far as his staging of action and suspense sequences are concerned. Presented an almost unlimited budget, the director does not fail to amaze, and for a series that has seen so many wonders and delights, the director still finds a way to offer up a number of new ones here. Johnson also continues a trend begun with Gareth Edwards’s Rogue One just last year in that The Last Jedi is visually stunning on a level we’re just not used to as it pertains to Star Wars, the eye-popping images he and cinematographer Steve Yedlin (Carrie) come up with frankly staggering. But the biggest thing this eighth chapter does is change where things go next in a fundamental way. As stated, by the time things end it is an open question as to whether or not the Skywalker journey has reached its conclusion. Rey is the new central figure around which everything must now revolve, her continuing dance of death with Kylo Ren the key component moving forward. It is there that Johnson makes his boldest statements, the director taking this intergalactic soap opera into a new, undiscovered part of the galaxy where up is down, right is wrong and everything we thought we knew about this series is flung seven steps in the opposite direction. This has me excited. It also has me loving Star Wars: The Last Jedi more than I initially realized as I exited the theatre, the Force strong with this sequel even if the ways in which it is moving prove to be more mysterious than they’ve ever been before.

"Dec 15, 2017",POSITIVE,"Armed with intelligent dialogue, fully dimensional characters, and the requisite wowie-zowie audio-visual effects, the Rian Johnson-Walt Disney Pictures-Lucasfilm-Ram Bergman Productions of Star Wars: The Last Jedi is pretty darned good."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE," Breathe. The Star Wars franchise is in good hands with writer-director Rian Johnson, who delivers an enthralling, often funny and at times achingly beautiful galactic adventure in The Last Jedi. Following on from The Force Awakens in 2015, directed by JJ Abrams, the events in the movie essentially occur during an extended intergalactic chase sequence. Carrie Fisher, who died after shooting had finished, plays a defiant Princess Leia, commanding the last remnants of the rebel fleet as they run from the giant arrowhead destroyers of the evil First Order. Stormtrooper defector Finn (John Boyega), finds himself in a meet cute situation with a maintenance worker (Kelly Marie Tran), before taking her on a behind the scenes mission. Meanwhile, Rey (the ever-compelling Daisy Ridley), picks up literally where the last film left off, making contact with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who's living in self-imposed exile on a remote island. Take a look at what some of our readers thought of the latest instalment in the Star Wars franchise — spoiler-free, of course — in the comments. But Johnson, collaborating with regular cinematographer Steve Yedlin, who's worked on all of his films from Brick to Looper, delivers a movie full of movement, elegance and colour. But he can also turn a small detail, like the way the hood of a robe frames the face of Mark Hamill, into a moment to savour. The recurring use of deep crimson is a dazzling motif. It appears initially in the shiny armour of First Order guards, then in a battle scene as war machines carve up the white surface of a salt-covered planet, revealing the blood red soil beneath. The question of what constitutes legitimate authority is a focus of various threads, and it's a particularly traumatic theme in Rey's story as she begins to question Luke's loyalty to the cause. The boldness with which The Last Jedi embraces its younger characters' dysfunction is what makes it such a welcome addition to the Star Wars series. The Star Wars fictional world arguably hits a sweet spot when it's about villains and heroes who are distinguishable only by the way they deal with their inner demons.

"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE," by Walter Chaw I wrestled for a long time with this review. Not what I would write but whether I should write it at all. I consider director Rian Johnson to be a friend. He’s kind, smart, true, and unaffected despite having been handed the reins to the most revered American mythology–save for becoming somehow more humble during the course of it. In the middle of a period in which everyone in the business, it seems, is being outed as a cad, Rian is something like hope that there are good and decent men left. Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (hereafter The Last Jedi) is every inch his movie. It’s about hope, see, and hope is the word that’s repeated most often in his script. By the end of it, he suggests that hope can even grow from salted earth. It’s a beautifully-rendered image as open, guileless-unto-corny, and genuine as Rian is. I don’t love everything in the film, but I do love Rian and The Last Jedi as a whole. In a franchise this venerated and valuable, it’s ballsy as fuck that he decided to do his own thing and that Disney let him. Now they’ve decided to invest another $600M or so in letting him do his own thing some more. 
In The Last Jedi, Rey (Daisy Ridley) presents a problem for Luke (Mark Hamill). She’s uncontainably powerful and probably untrainable, like he was once upon a time, far, far away. She sees a dark pit during a period of meditation and heads directly towards it. Luke is horrified: “You went right for it?” She didn’t think twice. She represents the new; Luke represents the old. When confronted with his own subconscious in The Empire Strikes Back, some 36 years ago now, he hesitates; he’s warned that whatever he takes with him in there is what he’ll find. Rey learns the same lesson without similar guidance. She discovers a Platonic mirror down there (maybe it’s Lacanian), next to a still pond. She learns who her parents are and then that it doesn’t matter, because at the end of it all, we are who we make ourselves. Johnson references Notorious in this scene, just as he references the likes of Black Narcissus and Akira Kurosawa throughout–but always with a purpose. Here, it’s to see the shadows of her parents merge like the shadows of Sebastian and his demonic mother when Alicia succumbs to bad tea. It says something about that particular relationship. The merging of the wraiths in Rey’s vision says something about that relationship, too. They’re both trapped, these heroines, by other people’s expectations of them. They’re both wounded by those who should have loved them the most. “Who are you?” asks Luke. And then he asks where she’s from. “No one’s from nowhere,” he says. Then he asks why they sent her to him, “Rey from Nowhere.” Luke tells Rey that he has three lessons for her. The first is that the Force is neither good nor bad, just the energy between opposite sides of the same devalued coins. Two halves of a coin is what we see, too, in the hands of Page (Veronica Ngo)–who is instrumental in an early space battle–and her sister, Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), as Rose mourns the Resistance’s losses. They are cut like a Yin/Yang. Separate, they are out of balance. The heroes of The Force Awakens are separated for almost the entire film. They’re all out of balance. The Last Jedi resembles The Empire Strikes Back‘s structure in that way, if in few others. Luke says to “Rey from Nowhere” that thinking the Force will die with the “last” Jedi is arrogance. It’s his way of warning her about arrogance and the importance of respecting that the older you get, the less you know anything with any certainty. I had all the answers twenty years ago. Now? Now I don’t know shit. The second lesson is that being lost in the past can be dangerous, can teach the wrong things to the cursorily enlightened. Luke’s asked if he’s read all of the sacred Jedi texts he’s placed on an altar in his hermitage. They’re not exactly, you know, riveting. He tells Rey that the Jedi are more useful as symbols than as actors, and Rey understands that symbols are important to the future. In one exchange, Johnson articulates the enduring importance of Star Wars to my generation of Americans. It was my first and most vital connection to this culture. There’s a scene near the middle where Luke is reunited with an old friend and they watch a home-movie together; I well and truly lost it for those few minutes. Rey tells Luke that Leia (Carrie Fisher) sent her “with hope.” We’re reminded of the last word uttered in Rogue One and the original entreaty in A New Hope when a hologram of Princess Leia pleads with an old friend of her father’s to join the Rebellion. She’s asking now for her brother to come home from exile. It’s a complicated gesture, because we know that Luke has failed his nephew, Leia’s son Ben (Adam Driver), the violent apprentice to the evil Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). In a series of Rashomon-style flashbacks, we learn of Luke’s failure and Ben’s vulnerability. Driver, it bears mentioning, is amazing. Again. The Last Jedi happens in the middle of the bleakest time that I can remember in our culture, and all it really has to say is that, in the words of Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), if you don’t believe in the sun, you’ll never survive the night. It talks about the right way and the wrong way to fight, about holding strong to the idea that there are still good people in the world, even when the line distinguishing right from wrong, truth from fiction, blurs. Finn (John Boyega) tells thief DJ (Benicio Del Toro) at one point that DJ is wrong for believing there’s no real morality in taking sides. In response, DJ says, devastatingly, “maybe.” It’s a shrug. We greet each new effrontery with the same kind of nonchalance-approaching-nihilism. We are a culture of not-surprised. We are beyond the capacity for satire, and so The Last Jedi approaches with its heart in its hand. This is not who we are, it says–this is who we used to be, if we care to remember. And who we could be, if we care to hope. The Last Jedi is about–most of all, then–self-determination. It destroys the idea of destiny and the notion that this story is bound to the Skywalker family. It’s about becoming comfortable in your skin: not by birthright, but through struggle, pain, perseverance; by making the good decision at the right time; and by hope. It values leadership and temperance. “Wisdom” isn’t a word said with scorn. What’s fascinating to me is that Luke shares the same worldview as Ben: they both want to eradicate the past. Luke wants to because it’s painful and he’s full of regret and shame. He’s uncomfortable with his reputation, which becomes a refrain in Finn’s initial reactions to Rose’s fawning recognition of him. Ben wants to because of his own regrets and shame, and then the belief that the future belongs to him. The past is an uncomfortable burden, so he plucks it out. He thinks he’s found an ideological partner in Rey, who should also be ashamed of her past, he thinks, growing up as nothing, nowhere. Maybe he has found one. Luke seeks to burn it all down. He’s stopped, but just for a moment and for a different purpose than is first apparent. He hasn’t changed much from the kid always looking towards the future. It’s his greatest flaw and his greatest strength. Ben’s, too, maybe. Hard to say. For a glimpse of what Johnson thinks about the past, catch what’s in a storage drawer at the very end in the belly of the Millennium Falcon. I should mention that the plotting in The Last Jedi is trip-hammer tight, as, you know, all of Johnson’s scripts have been. I didn’t like the sequence in a casino–a callback to the Star Wars Cantina, of course, but also a chance to discuss the evils of war profiteers and the 1%. There are creatures there, there’s slapstick, there’s a heist of sorts, and it all harks back to my favourite of Johnson’s films, The Brothers Bloom, in the interplay between the characters, in the lightness and clarity of the scheme. But it’s tonally disruptive, and it introduces a trio of children who seem like part of a different film. I’m not much invested in Rose and Finn (mileage may vary), though I do love the doomed chase of the Resistance fleet, running out of fuel, on the verge of mutiny from frustrated “Flyboy” Poe (Oscar Isaac), and watching their already-minuscule numbers further, cruelly reduced. There’s a frontier quality to the picture that’s extraordinary and raises the idea that if The Last Jedi is a western, then it truly believes we’re in transition, perhaps, and there’s reason not to despair. I love Ben and General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson). I love the samurai influences of Snoke’s Praetorian Guard and a final showdown borrowed from Sanjuro and shot like a Sergio Leone standoff against an impossible backdrop of machines of war. I love the movie’s courage and its honour. I love how much it loves its characters. I love that it so loves Star Wars that it challenges the series to be elevated in its ideas and its images. There’s a double sunrise set to a familiar John Williams motif. When Rey first wields Anakin’s lightsaber, her gorgeous theme rises up like the lump in my throat. The Last Jedi feels like something entirely new: a shot across the bow in the form of a message of peace and acceptance. A leap of faith. Luke never gets to teach his third lesson to Rey, but I think he teaches it to us. By being easily the most unconventional film in the octet, The Last Jedi underscores exactly what Star Wars was always about. Hope. We need it now more than ever."
"Dec 14, 2017",NEGATIVE,"It's easy to forget the original movie was a terrifically bold, innovative, industry-realigning blockbuster. Lucas dreamed big and took massive risks. In that sense, The Last Jedi could not be more different to the Star Wars created four decades ago."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE," I'm not just talking about the introduction of new merchandisable furries (yes, the Puss-in-Boots-like Porgs are cute) or the choreography of some of the entire series' most visually arresting lightsaber battles. While The Force Awakens took some flak for being, note-for-note, a 2015 remake of A New Hope, this instalment is no mere fan-pleasing update to The Empire Strikes Back. The Last Jedi opens with the Resistance, helmed by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), being pursued by the First Order, with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) in a decision-making tug-of-war. Meanwhile, in the most obvious mirroring of Episode V, Rey (Daisy Ridley) pursues Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) for Jedi training. The islet Luke has chosen for self-exile on the planet Ahch-To is a great trade-up from Empire's weird swamp. Ridley really comes into her own as Rey in this one. Her significance in The Force Awakens was at times overshadowed by the million different things going on, but in The Last Jedi she is a, if not the, force to be reckoned with, and Ridley is more than up to the emotional heft required for this role. The push and pull between them is my favourite thing in a movie full of things to enjoy. It plays out like a seduction, and the palpable chemistry between the pair makes it all work. (And no, this is not a spoiler.) Gleeson plays Hux as a great caricature of Evil Generals, complete with puffed up chest and Grand Threats. He plays Hux much like Alan Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, serving us some of the best laughs of the show. While there are solid doses of straight up comedy, the movie has a lot of heart. You feel for characters, even minor ones, who perish in battle. You feel for Rose, played by the wonderful Vietnamese-American actress Kelly Marie Tran, as she throws herself into the fray after a personal loss, and falls for another character. How does one even begin to describe how wonderful it is to see Hamill fully inhabit the role that made his name, and turn it inside out? ""Let the past die,"" says Kylo Ren at one point. ""Kill it, if you have to. That's the only way to become what you are meant to be."" Johnson hasn't remade the entire wheel but this movie - not just a good Star Wars movie, but a good movie, as one colleague has pointed out - confidently takes the series beyond nostalgia and into a future that looks very, very promising."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE," Real-life derring-do from a ragtag team of World War II commandos trying to cripple the Nazi naval war machine – with the flash of Guy Ritchie. Luca Guadagnino’s latest is a fierce, fast passion play in the ranks of pro tennis with two former besties and the woman who’s literally between them. These looks at what’s on screen in the coming week include Fritz Lang’s 1927 silent science fiction masterpiece “Metropolis” with live musical accompaniment, spooky doings for Space Week, Michael Cimino’s 1978 Best Picture winner “The Deer Hunter,” dual Gatsbys and more. Some might call this a manipulative stoking of fears, and they’d be right, but the charge is forgotten as Alex Garland stages a phenomenally choreographed siege of Washington, D.C., that’s as heartbreaking as it is breathtaking. These looks at what’s on screen in the coming week include Wicked Queer fest fare at The Brattle (which also has “Muppet Madness” and a 2024 Space Film Festival), very different Somerville Theatre noirs and poetic works by Margaret Tait at the Harvard Film Archive. In theaters now are Alice Rohrwacher’s “La Chimera,” Dev Patel’s debut “Monkey Man,” Luc Besson‘s unusual “DogMan” and Thea Sharrock’s comedy inspired by true events, “Wicked Little Letters.” These looks at what’s on screen in the coming week include The Wicked Queer Film Festival at The Brattle, works at the roots of modern horror in Somerville, “Taxi Driver” in Kendall Square and Best International Feature Oscar nominee “Traces” at Fresh Pond."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE,"The Last Jedi is the best Star Wars film since 1980's The Empire Strikes Back because it's so much more than stars and wars. It's those stories, joys, and pains of the heroes, villains, and nobodies who lived it."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE," Daisy Ridley plays a plucky heroine learning Jedi ways from cranky old Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in “Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi.” (Lucasfilm Ltd.)

"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE," In terms of franchise filmmaking, Star Wars requires an unusual lack of ego from new directors. Unlike superhero movies, where individualism is a strength (Logan; Thor: Ragnarok), no one wants to see a quirky Star Wars movie. Not in the main saga, anyway. The Last Jedi had to forge ahead with new ideas without straying too far from earlier films. In the hands of director Rian Johnson, The Last Jedi is dark but easily the funniest Star Wars movie to date, building on familiar themes with a powerfully lovable cast. Continuing straight from The Force Awakens, our heroes aren’t as victorious as we hoped. The Resistance spends most of the film in retreat, fleeing the crushing grip of the First Order. In the Original Trilogy, the Rebel Alliance fighters were plucky underdogs, but they still had the backing of planetary leaders and a network of hidden bases. Now, Leia’s army appears tiny and alone in the galaxy. She mourns every loss, keenly aware that her team is shrinking and she could be next. X-Wing pilot Poe Dameron is Leia’s chosen successor, although he’s not quite ready for command. Introduced as a delightfully simple hero in The Force Awakens, I couldn’t be happier with Poe’s new character development. His primary traits are handsomeness and dashing bravery, and The Last Jedi asks the question: What if he was too dashing? Poe just wants to grin rakishly while blowing up enemy ships, but as Leia points out, war isn’t all about straightforward heroism. This lesson arrives in the form of Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), a Resistance commander who becomes a foil for Poe’s charming but thoughtless courage. Our new trio spends most of The Last Jedi apart, with Rey at an ancient Jedi temple with Luke Skywalker, and Finn befriending the adorably sincere yet tough Resistance engineer Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran). Like Finn, Rose is a footsoldier in a world of princesses, generals, and legends—but she still understands the war better than he does. Despite their separation, Finn and Rey are thematically linked by their energetic cluelessness, a welcome callback to Luke’s role as a foolish teenager in A New Hope. Luke has since matured into a cynical curmudgeon, following in the footsteps of Obi-Wan Kenobi’s flawed mentorship. Between Luke, Leia, and the diverse crew of soldiers in the Resistance, we get a realistic cross-section of a generation-long war. Unlike Han Solo, who barely changed in 35 years, this aging Luke is a world away from the golden boy of the Rebel Alliance. Broken by Ben Solo’s defection to the Dark Side, he sees Rey’s untrained power as a threat rather than an opportunity. Yet some familiar notes shine through, like that trademark Skywalker bitchy humor, and the fact that Luke just spent the best part of a decade sulking. I mean, sure. He did have a reason to feel bad and move to a sad rainy island in the middle of nowhere. But you don’t see Leia moping around, do you? It almost goes without saying that The Last Jedi is gorgeous to watch. Star Wars thrives on visual worldbuilding and symbolism, giving us a dual explanation for the film’s overwhelmingly red posters. The color obviously symbolizes the Dark Side, but also… there’s just a lot of red in this movie. One memorable setpiece involves Supreme Leader Snoke’s blood-red chamber (like all good supervillains, he’s into interior design); another is an action sequence where land-skimmers kick plumes of red dust from a salt flat. The casino planet of Canto Bight loomed large in Disney’s promotional campaign, but I suspect that’s because it’s a spoiler-free location. The best new locations are surprises, with an evocative role for Luke’s island home on Ahch-To. The Jedi temple is a new spin on Yoda’s hermitage on Dagoba, a swamp whose natural energy was a direct opposite to the sterility of the Empire. Ahch-To is colder and more remote, yet gives us a clearer view of the Force. As Luke grudgingly shares his Jedi wisdom, Rey dives headfirst into her newfound power. We can’t be sure if she’s accessing the Dark or Light, inviting us to wonder if she’ll actually become a Jedi or a new kind of Force-using warrior. Director Rian Johnson injected a healthy dose of unpredictability into The Last Jedi. Structurally speaking, it’s a 150-minute sequence of constant peril where the heroes take turns to rescue each other in the nick of time. There are dozens of scenes where the main characters stand on a knife’s edge between death and survival, more convincingly than your average Hollywood action scene. We know that they might die, although that’s not actually the most compelling concern. That honor goes to the relationship between Rey and Kylo Ren, the new protagonists of the Skywalker mythos. (And no, that’s not a spoiler about Rey’s parentage. I wouldn’t do that to you.) Kylo Ren gets a lot of screentime in The Last Jedi, something that may inspire controversy among fans. The franchise previously relied on simple but effective villains, and some fans dislike the idea of Kylo Ren becoming “too sympathetic.” After watching The Last Jedi, these worries don’t hold water. The more character development Kylo Ren receives, the more hateable he becomes. Not because he’s awe-inspiringly evil like his idol Darth Vader, but because he’s pathetic and volatile in a deeply realistic way. He’s an angry man-child who wants to see the world burn, propped up by the infrastructure of the First Order. He and General Hux are catastrophically bad leaders, and wouldn’t last five minutes without a fleet of expensive ships and mindlessly loyal officers behind them. Some of the film’s biggest laughs come from Hux or Kylo giving stupid, rage-fuelled orders, with Domnhall Gleeson giving an apoplectic performance in the shrieking tradition of Eddie Redmayne in Jupiter Ascending. With Luke and Anakin, we didn’t really wonder whether they’d follow the light or step into the dark. We knew the answer. That’s less true of Rey and Kylo Ren, whose destiny (or lack thereof) is more ambiguous. Kylo is torn by his incomplete submission to the Dark Side, while Rey is endangered by her hot-tempered nature and youthful naivety. As Luke haphazardly trains Rey in the ways of the Force, she’s secretly having psychic Skype sessions with Kylo Ren, each trying to convert the other to their side of the war. We can plausibly imagine either of them winning the argument, which makes for stressful viewing because we obviously don’t want Rey to succumb. And even the most ardent Kylo Ren hater must admit that Adam Driver’s performance is tremendous, expressing emotional vulnerability in a thoroughly toxic and manipulative way. He’s desperate for Rey to join him, but tries to do so by convincing her that she’s worthless and alone. The Resistance hangs onto survival by pure desperation and last-ditch hope, wounded both by the First Order and by the stifling apathy that surrounds them. At one point they call out for help and no one comes. The First Order may be terrifying, but the Resistance’s secondary enemy is people who don’t care at all. This mindset is embodied by “DJ” (Benicio Del Toro), a hacker recruited by Rose and Finn. He’s an unpleasant version of Han Solo: a cynical rogue who sees no difference between sides in the war. Arriving at a key moment in Finn’s story, he’s the equivalent of a temptation to the dark side. What if DJ is right? Finn already survived a lifetime of torment as a First Order soldier, and now he’s risking his life for a rebellion he barely understands. He just wants peace, and DJ’s apolitical stance represents an easy way out. Of course, we know Finn won’t take it; he loves Rey too much, and he’s a good person at heart. But you can see how a person like DJ grows out of the war, in the same way that Rose’s backstory explains her passionate dedication to the Resistance. On opposite sides of the galaxy, Luke Skywalker and Kylo Ren are trying their damnedest to not care at all. Luke just wants the Jedi to die in peace, running away from his legacy as a mythic hero. Meanwhile, Kylo Ren desperately tries to convince himself (and Rey) that he’s erased his own past. Of course, Kylo’s brand of immature nihilism is patently nonsense. Despite being 30 years old, he’s like a teenager who screams and roars about how much he doesn’t care. He hypocritically criticizes Rey for wanting to know about her parents, when really, he’s more obsessed with the past than anyone else. I noted down just two quotes while watching The Last Jedi. The first was a comment from one of the older characters, expressing how the new generation will learn to surpass them: “We are what they grow beyond.” The second was a delightful one-liner from Finn: “Let’s go, chrome-dome.” It’s the yin and yang of Star Wars. Rian Johnson understands how to balance the strengths of the franchise, which is simultaneously a fun action-comedy for kids, and a decades-long epic with meaty philosophical themes."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE," Whew! With all due respect to those who loved the dour shoot-em-up violence of Rogue One, Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi thankfully returns to the tone of fun, adventure, and especially camaraderie that J.J. Abrams established so well inThe Force Awakens. We love and resent the Star Wars movies in equal measure for their familiarity. The Force Awakens echoed the basic structure of the original Star Wars — which had its roots in millennia of human storytelling — yet it was still criticized as the most derivative thing in the history of derivation. Similarly, The Last Jedi hits many of The Empire Strikes Back’s overall beats: The good guys are being pursued by the bad guys while the Force-sensitive protagonist is on a remote planet with a cranky Jedi. Though we return to Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Luke Skywalker (Brigsby Bear’s Mark Hamill) on that mountain soon enough, The Last Jedi begins not where The Force Awakens left off but rather with a big space battle, led by the increasingly cocky Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), who butts heads with General Leia (Carrie Fisher) along the way. Still, The Last Jedi frequently zigs when you might otherwise expect it to zag. Perhaps more than any other Star Wars film, even the previous one with the word Jedi in the title, The Last Jedi is concerned with family. Not in the sense of who sprang from whose loins — though the issue of Rey’s parentage is an ongoing concern — but rather that these are people who care about each other. When separated, they frequently ask about their absent friends, while heartbreaking new character Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) points out to the returning Finn (John Boyega) they’ll win the war not by killing what they hate, but saving what they love. There’s still plenty of “go to a place to get a thing to do a thing” plot mechanics, but even with the legion of visual effects artists at work, some of the most effective scenes are told with the simplest cinematic language. A look between two characters speaks more than a million pixels, and the way Johnson visualizes a psychic bond between Rey and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) demonstrates the power of montage at its most basic. Haunting the proceedings is the fact that Carrie Fisher passed away after filming, and The Last Jedi is a far more fitting tribute to her than the CGI nightmare at the end of Rogue One. Meanwhile, between this and Twin Peaks: The Return, it should be clear that if you want to make your latest entry in a decades-old franchise even better, just add Laura Dern with crayon-colored hair. Whether as the foul-mouthed Diane in Twin Peaks: The Return or Vice Admiral Holdo in The Last Jedi — who you just know would say “Fuck you, Poe” if she could — Dern gets shit done. The Last Jedi is not a perfect Star Wars movie by any means. (Luke refers to his lightsaber as “a laser sword,” so that’s canon now.) But y’know what? The Porgs are fine. They’re more like Tribbles than Ewoks, anyway. Opens Thursday at the Alamo Drafthouse New Mission, the AMC Metreon 16, the Century San Francisco Centre 9, the AMC Van Ness 14, the AMC Dine-In Kabuki, the CineArts Empire, the Presidio Theatre, and the Balboa Twin."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE," ""Let
the past die,"" says the villain, who has modeled himself in look and
approach after his villainous grandfather. One could call the villain
hypocritical in his outlookdenying the power of the past while embracing the
aspects he admires. It's seen as a struggle, though, since, like his forebear,
the villain here is caught between good and evilor, in the series' language,
the light and the dark. Star Wars: Episode
VIII  The Last Jedi has a similar struggle. It's between the old and the
new, the past and the present, and the desire to create something different and
the necessity of returning to the series' formula. That
this struggle comes through within the narrative shows the benefits of handing
over the series to new minds. This time, it's writer/director Rian Johnson
taking the reins of the eighth official installment in the Star
Wars saga. He clearly knows the material well enough to give us exactly what
we expect, and he loves it enough to take it into new territory. By the
end of the film, we have no idea where this new sequence of stories from a long
time ago in this galaxy far, far away will go. Some established narrative
characteristics are re-affirmed by the finale, but there's a wild card, too: a
hero who comes to represent both possible salvation and the destruction of the
old ways. Just from that standpoint, the possibilities of where this tale could
go are exciting for the first time in a while. Before
that, though, Johnson treats us to a story that develops the franchise's newest
characters, reinvents the characters whom we thought we knew, and examines the
constant battle between the past and the present that has come to be the saga's
overarching concern. If the previous installment
juggled the new characters and the established ones with jovial ease, this one
throws the metaphorical balls into the air, watches them crash together, and
waits to see how they'll land. We have
Rey (Daisy Ridley), of course, who was last seen on an island in the middle of a
vast ocean on some forgotten planet, where Jedi Master Luke Skywalker (Mark
Hamill) has been in hiding. We think we know Luke from the original trilogy of
filmsthe young kid, eager for adventure, who transforms into a righteous hero
of an ancient, mostly forgotten order of religious knights. His first action
upon receiving his old weapon is to toss it off the side of a cliff. His first
words to Rey are, ""Go away."" Luke
has changed. He lives as a hermit. He no longer studies the Force, the
mysterious thing that binds the universe together and serves to balance the
light with the dark. He's convinced that the order of the Jedi needs to end, and
if the galaxy needs a hero to save it from the crushing might of the First
Order, that hero is definitely not going to be him. Meanwhile,
after destroying the Republic (and, here, after a whiz-bang space battle of an
opening sequence), the First Orderled by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and General
Hux (Domhnall Gleeson, adopting the wicked sneer of a baddie from a Saturday
morning serial)is prepared to destroy the Resistance in one, fell swoop.
General Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher) has one choice: to keep the few,
remaining Resistance ships just ahead of the First Order's fleet. The hope is
that help or a solution will arrive before they run out of fuel. The reckless
and joking flyboy Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac, given more to do this time with his
character's repeated undermining of the story's more severe elements), the
conflicted former stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega), and mechanical whiz Rose
(Kelly Marie Train) come up with another, more daring plan. The
alternative plan fits into a certain mold, as Finn and Rose visit a wealthy
planet where the galaxy's elites waste their money on gambling and other
luxuries. It's a solid, lengthy sequence that features some of the more
imaginative world-building and character designs that we've seen from the
series. The subplot also gives Finn, who begins the story still of the mind of
running away from his past hardships and present troubles, an opportunity to
grow into the sort of hero we'd expect from this. As a bonus, we get Benicio Del
Toro as a master thief with a cynical outlook on the ways that the First Order
and the Resistance are the tools of some other, uncaring force in the galaxy. The
heart of the film, though, is to be found on that island, where the
disillusioned Luke and the optimistic Rey find themselves at an impasse about
the Force, the distinction between the dark and the light, and the nature of
legends against the less romantic reality. It's not just the centerpiece story
of the film. It gets to the core of what this new series of films is doing with
the mythology of the larger series. Heroes
can make mistakes, as Luke admits to doing in his training of Kylo Ren. The old
ways and stories are useful in determining the course of the present, but they
are not the be-all and end-all of how to live, act, and be (An unexpected but
welcome cameo solidifies this notion). Hamill's performance embodies these ideas
in a way that shatters not only our understanding of Luke but also our memories
of the sometimes-uncertain actor from those earlier films. His new
interpretation of Luke is hardened and filled with remorse and loss. Everything
changes by the end of the film, from the characters (Even Poe, spurred on by
Leia, has to confront his recklessness), to what seemed to be this series'
central conflict, and to which set of charactersthe new ones or the familiar
oneswill take up the mantle of this fight. In a subversive way, Johnson
creates a paradigm shift with Star Wars:
Episode VIII  The Last Jedi. We don't even noticing it happening, because
we're caught up in the sights of battles and worlds, the development of the
series' characters, and a genuine sense of conflicting ideas being explored and
reconciled."
"Dec 14, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Moving on from previous glories to start anew furnishes greater moments for the characters than the story, but it adds to a movie that's thoughtful, emotional and contemplative."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE,"If the previous entry presented a respectably staid melding of old and new, this one wires everything up, cranks the juice, and lets her rip."

"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE," [star rating=”4″] STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI. Directed by Rian Johnson, with Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Daisey Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Laura Dern, Gwendoline Christie, Domhnall Gleeson. Long, long ago, in a galaxy far, far away, Leia sent Rey to go looking for her brother. But, it turns out Luke is just having none of that because he firmly believes the Jedi need to be gone already. No, that isn’t a spoiler – it’s in the trailer. But, don’t worry, there is so much that isn’t in the trailer. As Luke puts it: “This is not going to go the way you think,” and truly, it doesn’t. Talking about the storyline for Star Wars: The Last Jedi does rather take away the surprise, which is half the reason you go to watch the movie. The other half of the reason is the absolute sheer spectacle of gorgeous visuals. The intricate world building and creature design makes you feel like it is all real. This is a movie made for the big screen – space battles for epic scale, scary land battles for intimate one on one fights and little details to fill in the gaps. Like, we know the porgs are the hot ticket toy of the season, but finding out where they come from is funny. The Last Jedi to reference its predecessors not only in terms of furthering the storyline, but also the actual structure of the films. Yes, The Last Jedi does reference Empire Strikes Back to a certain extent but not as slavishly as The Force Awakens mirrored A New Hope. The jokes help to change the tone for one thing, but so does Mark Hamill. Now he gets to be the old man imparting his wisdom and his Luke Skywalker is a very different Jedi Master to wily Ben Kenobi. We are introduced to two new planets – the blingy lights of casino world Canto Bight and the salt flats of Crait as well as several new characters. Most of the big players from The Force Awakens returns as the First Order chase down the remaining remnants of the Rebellion, having practically destroyed the New Republic’s bases of power. Carrie Fisher’s Leia Organa is pragmatic focusing on the survival of her people, much to the chagrin of Oscar Isaac’s Dameron Poe who wants to strike back with everything they have. Finn (Boyega) vacillates between trying to stay out of the First Order’s crosshairs and wanting to save his friend Rey (Ridley) who is just trying to figure out her place in the world. Plus we learn a bit more about why Ben Solo (Driver) is the way he is and get up close and personal with Supreme Leader Snoke (Serkis). There is just so much happening with so many people that unlike The Force Awakens we never really get a sense of any one person’s arc or personal growth. Except maybe Luke who finally understands what Yoda was trying to tell him all those years ago. So many films in Star Wars can afford to make a film that covers such a short span of relative time, where a lot of things happen to set up a way forward. We are now at the point where the personal storylines span multiple films to make up a space opera that gets watched on repeat. Epic, fun, visually sumptuous, it will tug at your heart strings because we come to know the characters across several episodes and we root for them when we recognise our own emotional responses in theirs."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE," Ten minutes into Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi — the eighth instalment of the Skywalker saga — you know it’s different from every other Star Wars film you’ve ever seen: There’s more unexpected bravado, violence, humour, loss and grief packed in there than a Star Wars fan might generally be comfortable with, and I mean that in a good way.  Johnson (Brick, Looper) seems to have found the right formula to kick-start a new era in Star Wars storytelling without seeming formulaic. While all of us remember JJ Abrams’ The Force Awakens and how lovingly he refashioned the Star Wars lore for a new generation of fans, the film also didn’t escape that strong sense of deja vu it invoked: a new Rebellion vs Empire storyline, a new Luke Skywalker-type (orphaned, living in a forgotten part of the galaxy, strong in the Force) and even a new Death Star. And if The Force Awakens was A New Hope redone, it only follows that The Last Jedi will channel Empire Strikes Back, one of the most successful sequels in the history of geekdom. And if you’d have watched the trailers (which we all did, over and over again), a healthy dose of misdirection and their overtly dark themes and tone would have all but confirmed those suspicions.  Johnson, however, breaks all rules and truly creates something boldly original. While the fanboy in him dug deep into Star Wars canon to fashion new battlefields for our heroes to fight their timeless wars between right wrong, good and evil (with a capital E), love and hate; he also entirely changed the rules of the game.  No longer is the world so black and white, (even if all the villains must wear black). There is a healthy dose of grey, which lets characters make choices that are not governed by their place, station and rank in the story; and which also leads Johnson to pile on a body count that could make the best of us squirm in our seats.  But what is the film about? Without getting into spoiler area: The Rebel fleet, led by General Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher), is desperately trying to outrun the evil First Order, led by General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson). Joining him on this quest are Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis CGI’d beyond recognition, as always) and his conflicted apprentice, Kylo Ren/Ben Solo (Adam Driver), and fresh off murdering his own father, Han Solo (Harrison Ford). In another far-flung part of the galaxy, things pick up right where we left them at the end of The Force Awakens. Rey (Daisy Ridley), the scruffy orphan kid from a desert outpost nobody cares about, has united with her unwilling mentor and Jedi-in-exile Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).  Characters such as Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) are given their own arcs as they must complete mini-missions and go on mini-adventures (not all of them altogether necessary but tend to provide some political angle to a story that’s mostly about things that go pew-pew-pew in the deep trenches of space, glorious space).  New characters such as Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose Tico, Laura Dern’s Vice Admiral Holdo and Benicio Del Toro’s amusing hacker are all welcome additions, and receive their own moments of glory, but could have benefited from additional depth. The film over and over again tells us to let go of the past and look to the future — something as literal as handing over of the lightsabre takes place — and while all of this makes us look forward to the final sequel of the trilogy, a clear cliffhanger was conspicuous in its absence, going to say that The Last Jedi is a film intent on tying up loose ends and starting afresh. The fact that the film has managed to add more to the Force lore than ever before (without ever having to mention the dreaded midichlorians) is testament to this. The Last Jedi is not a film for the faint of heart. But courage, a sense of wonder, a resounding faith in the strength of love, and a healthy dose of hope will take you far. "
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE," Advent’s greatest appeal is its narrative power — the sign of hope amid darkness, the promise of something new coming. It reminds us that the story of God’s people is about to change, giving way to a new story characterized by compassion. Advent also reminds us to apply that same optimism to the world we live in now. We are, as Dietrich Bonhoeffer defines it in God Is in the Manger: Reflections on Advent and Christmas, “hopefully doing without,” believing in a better world because our faith tells us it will one day come. In this sense, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an Advent movie. Director Rian Johnson’s wildly fun and thoughtful entry into the Star Wars canon finds its heroes at a precarious turning point. The film makes its characters grapple with the flaws of their established order, consider whether any of it is worth saving, and move forward by embracing the hopeful qualities of the Force and the Resistance. The film picks up where 2015’s The Force Awakens left off, with Rey (Daisy Ridley) finding Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), looking for help for the Resistance cause from the Jedi Master, and for greater understanding of her own Force-based abilities. But Luke is not in a helpful mood. He’s living in self-imposed exile after failing to save Ben, his nephew, (Adam Driver) from giving in to the dark side and becoming the formidable sith Kylo Ren. Luke sees the Jedi legacy as one of failure, and believes their exclusionary, elitist tendencies mean that it’s time for the order to die. At the same time, the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) faces destruction from the Kylo Ren-led First Order. Leia and her troops, including pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and First Order-defector Finn (John Boyega) are on the run from the First Order, with a dwindling supply of fuel. They need an exit strategy, but options are looking slim and Leia’s low-key survival plan is in direct conflict with Poe’s desire for action. Without revealing any more, the resolution of these stories involves all our heroes, both old and new, making mistakes and facing failures past and present. We see the damaging, embittering effects of the Jedi order in Kylo Ren, as well as its potential for positive transformation in Rey. In both the Jedi and the Resistance, Johnson presents equally compelling arguments for starting over from scratch and fighting to save what’s left. This surely sounds familiar for anyone watching the current splits in politics and in the church. We’re living in a moment where all of our established orders are in the midst of their own transformations. The Church faces turmoil between conservative and progressive stances, making it more important than ever to preach a gospel of love and inclusion in the face of hatred. Our political sphere is in conflict, too, not just in deciding whether we’ll give in to our darker, fear-based tendencies, but also in addressing years of prejudice and abuse on both sides of the aisle. Advent gives us hope because we already know how the story ends. Although our own story isn’t over yet, we look to the Advent narrative to remind ourselves that change is coming. Similarly, Star Wars: The Last Jedi leans in to its democratizing message of optimism and possibility, more so than any of its predecessors. Our heroes are hopefully doing without, believing in a better world because they know it’s possible, even when that better world seems far away. This Advent season, we’re doing the same thing.

"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE," It's like WWII, only fun! In Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the alt-right First Order has the rebels bottled up—""the RESISTANCE,"" the title crawl says in capital letters, a stealth howdy to anti-Trumpers. On the throne is Supreme Leader Snoke, a granddaddy version of Baby Eraserhead played by Andy Serkis. This moldy dictator faces the same problems Lord Vader had back in the day—sass from a supercilious general (Domhnall Gleeson) and disappointing results from a prize pupil, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who returned empty-handed from his mission to find Luke Skywalker. In writer and director Rian Johnson's entry in this series—maybe the strongest and sharpest in the 40-year-long epic—fractiousness abounds. Skywalker (Mark Hamill) sulks in his island monastery, overrun with cute space-puffins called porgs; the birdies turn the Millennium Falcon into their rookery. The noble finale of the last episode had Daisy Ridley's Rey passing the lightsaber to the bearded hermit Luke. It's picked up right where we left off: Luke tosses the unwanted weapon over his shoulder and vows that he will no longer teach the Jedi arts. Eventually, he changes his mind. Here, the Force is a spiritual disciple anyone awake can feel their way into. This is opposed to what could be called George Lucas's single worst idea: making the Force into an inherited quality, found in aristocrats with midi-chlorians in their blood. The rebels are a matriarchy now. When General Leia (Carrie Fisher, doing a lot of post-mortem acting) is incapacitated by an attack, a new admiral takes over. It's Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern), whose idea of an insurgent's uniform is a lavender evening gown with ruffles. Dern carries herself like a goddess, but she has some strife with one of her rebellious pilots, ""a hotshot flyboy"" named Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). The 1990s Star Wars entries had big name actors, but they stood around like chess pieces. Watch Last Jedi and think, ""My God, it's full of stars."" Isaac has never looked better than he does here in the cockpit, stripping the cannons off the dreadnought with his missiles, and later asking for more: ""Permission to jump into an X-wing and blow something up."" Rich with minutia is a new wretched hive of scum and villainy, a casino planet. Johnson speeds the camera through like a drone so we can admire the fauna at this chimera-Vegas. One is a drunken little punter in evening clothes who mistakes the beachball-shaped android BB8 for a slot machine. Finn (John Boyega) and his new comrade Rose Tico (the show-stealing Kelly Marie Tran), who are there looking for help, end up arrested for a parking violation. In the lockup they meet a scurvy yet adept thief (Benicio del Toro)—a jailbird who's been inside enough times that he knows to sleep with his boots around his neck, so that they don't get stolen. Kylo Ren's walking-wounded emoism looks even more handsomely thwarted than it did last time; to paraphrase Hunter S. Thompson, Driver has the embarrassing sensuality of a 13-year-old girl's drawing of a horse. ""You're just a child in a mask,"" jeers Snoke. As if stagecraft hadn't impressed Snoke, too.  In a movie in which most of the interiors are cluttered with steaming, smoking aircraft and gridded in with cat walks, Snoke's throne room is an empty Cinemascopic hangar in glowing vermillion, with a few shiny flunkies in eyeless suits of crimson armor on guard. Long-memoried movie fans see this space, and think ""Arthur Freed, MGM, mid-1950s.""  And there is a rumble to come on this dance floor, illuminated with lightsabers. As always in these spectacles, stuff is scribbled in the margins that makes it dense, such as a sea monster breaching and diving, unnoticed, in the sea behind the cliffs Luke paces upon. And the movie recalls echoes of the first film: just as we first saw Luke on a planet of two suns, a double-sunset illuminates our last sight of the old knight. The movie's richness invites more than one viewing. Johnson's mature and questioning attitude illuminate this stirring movie about rebellion—reveling in the panache of suicide warriors as well as feeling for the choices of traitors and cowards."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE,"The Last Jedi continues that transition in a way that will gratify those who were around for the beginning of the series. In other words, let the space exploration continue."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE,"Certainly J.J. Abrams' 2015 ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" was more than satisfying, but Johnson steps it up several notches, digging deeper into characters, and even adding nuance to the ""Star Wars"" mythos."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE,"Even with the warts, Star Wars: The Last Jedi feels like a big, dazzling holiday present most Star Wars fans should be able to tear into and enjoy."
"Dec 14, 2017",NEGATIVE,The Last Jedi is built on a series of oppositions relative to one of the best known films ever made. It's the prisoner of its middle chapter predecessor.
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE," Después de que Walt Disney adquiriese los derechos de Star Wars luego de una transacción multimillonaria, era evidente que sus planes eran explotar la marca al máximo al crear muchos filmes y productos que ampliaran la historia de este universo. Fue así que llegó The Force Awakens (J.J. Abrams, 2015) cinta que a pesar de sus numerosas fallas, logró emplear el elemento nostálgico para presentar a una nueva serie de personajes, además de permitirnos ver a nuestros viejos héroes una vez más. Posteriormente, se estrenó el primer spin-off de la saga con Rogue One, una cinta que nos mostró el lado más bélico y emocionante de Star Wars en sus últimos 30 minutos, por lo que el hype por el episodio VIII era enorme. Y por fin, después de dos largos años llegó el tan esperado estreno de The Last Jedi, solo para darnos cuenta de que muy probablemente, lo peor que le pudo pasar a esta franquicia es que fuera adquirida por Disney. La historia inicia prácticamente donde The Force Awakens terminó, en donde Rey (Daisy Ridley) y compañía encuentran a Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) y tratan de convencerlo para que ayude a la resistencia, para así lograr derrotar a la Primera Orden. Por el otro lado, los miembros sobrevivientes de la Resistencia tratan de escapar de los constantes ataques de la Primera Orden donde Finn (John Boyega), bajo órdenes de Poe (Oscar Isaac) lleva a cabo una misión de incógnito para tratar de desactivar el sistema de rastreo de una de las naves más poderosas de sus enemigos, para así lograr completar el escape. A lo largo del filme, veremos una serie de situaciones que nos remiten en automático a partes de El Imperio Contraataca y El Regreso del Jedi, demostrando nuevamente que el fanservice y la nostalgia seguirán siendo factores importantes para la construcción del futuro de la franquicia, aunque también es un punto en contra ya que se siente que se abusa de ésto, además de que los nuevos elementos narrativos no terminan por cuajar del todo. Sin llegar a dar spoilers, el pasado y origen de dos personajes es hecho añicos a través de resoluciones muy improvisadas solo para causar “impacto” en la trama. Personajes nuevos que son introducidos solo para ser “incluyentes” en cuanto a género y color de piel, pero que no cuentan con un aporte o desarrollo apropiado más allá de querer sembrar semillas para expander el universo en el que se lleva a cabo. Incluso, a pesar de contar con un inicio espectacular —no sin dejar de lado un chiste muy soso que vendría siendo una advertencia de lo que estaba por venir— y un par de momentos verdaderamente memorables a lo largo de la película, poco a poco se ven opacados por  las enormes lagunas que existen en el guión. Personajes tan icónicos y complejos como Luke se ven reducidos a nada, donde la comedia de pastelazo y la ausencia de un conflicto real siempre se ven presentes. Kylo Ren a pesar de contar con un arco narrativo realmente prometedor, se vuelve a convertir en un personaje estúpido y berrinchudo, Rey nuevamente logra salir adelante de forma autodidacta poniendo en duda las habilidades y sabiduría de los Jedis más poderosos como Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, Anakin Skywalker o Mace Windu, porque de qué sirve el entrenamiento si eres técnicamente, una princesa Disney. Eso sí, a nivel visual y sonoro la película es exquisita, desde la gran banda sonora creada por el maestro John Williams (quien se redime después de su tibio score para The Force Awakens), hasta las grandes secuencias de acción, llena de efectos visuales de primer nivel, las cuales lograrán emocionar a cualquier espectador, fan o no de la saga. Aunque cabe resaltar que las batallas con sables láser de ésta nueva trilogía dejan mucho que desear, donde incluso Rogue One en menos de dos minutos supera por completo a cualquier enfrentamiento de The Force Awakens o The Last Jedi, algo verdaderamente lamentable ya que es uno de los elementos más icónicos de Star Wars. A final de cuentas, The Last Jedi es una muestra de lo que Disney pretende hacer con esta franquicia, convertirla en un producto lleno de clichés, tramas vacías, villanos olvidables, personajes unidimensionales y emplear el mismo esquema una y otra vez para tratar de obtener las máximas ganancias posibles tal y como lo está haciendo con los super-héroes a través de Marvel, pues al fin y al cabo a la mayor parte de la audiencia lo que le interesa es pasar un buen rato para olvidarse de su realidad. Pero después de que se hiciese oficial la adquisición de 21st Century Fox a manos de Disney, es realmente preocupante que una empresa tenga (en su mayoría) el control creativo de todo lo que vemos y disfrutamos. Tal vez Disney se está convirtiendo en el equivalente al malévolo Imperio Galáctico y nosotros en los rebeldes, donde el futuro de lo que consumimos está en nuestras propias manos. El tiempo lo dirá."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE," Rey (Daisy Ridley) has been trusted with an urgent assignment: persuading Jedi master Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to abandon his self-imposed exile on a remote planet and rejoin the Resistance. But when the two come face to face, his reaction isn’t quite what she expected. Meanwhile, Gen. Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) of the nefarious First Order is determined to wipe out the rebels for whom Rey has become a new hope. Achieving that goal would undercut the authority of Hux’s rival, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), as they compete for the favor of Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). But the Resistance is just as determined to survive — the question is arriving at the proper strategy. As far as pilot Poe Dameron is concerned, firepower is always an attractive option. Although Gen. Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) admires his gung-ho spirit, she chastises Dameron for not thinking things through — and not taking enough responsibility when his plans go awry. Dameron has allies in Stormtrooper-turned-Resistance fighter Finn (John Boyega) and mechanic Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), with whom he collaborates on a plot to deal a deadly blow to the First Order. “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” has more than enough action, humor and stuff blowing up to thoroughly satisfy fans of the long-running franchise. Working from his own screenplay, director Rian Johnson (“Looper”) delivers a film that’s a bit too long at 2½ hours but feels riskier than its predecessor, “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” With this installment, the characters introduced in “Force Awakens” — and the actors who play them — have come into their own. Ridley and Boyega exude charisma, and Isaac takes full advantage of his bolstered screen time. But old hand Hamill turns in the film’s most affecting performance."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE," Like its immediate predecessor, The Force Awakens, director Rian Johnson’s installment trades a little too much on nostalgia. But it does so with cleverness, verve, and depth. When Star Wars: The Force Awakens hit theaters two years ago, my reaction to it—like that of many people—had two distinct phases: initial elation (it’s erased all signs of the prequels!); and, later, mild disappointment at the over-reliance on nostalgia and recyclings from the first trilogy (another Death Star?). This was always going to be a tricky balance—long-awaited fan fulfillment versus something genuinely fresh—and I suggested at the time that final judgment on the movie would depend in part on its sequels: If they branched out in new directions, The Force Awakens’s flaws would be easily forgiven; if, on the other hand, “we again find our heroes lassoing AT-ATs on a snow-covered planet”—à la The Empire Strikes Back—it would be a bad sign for the franchise. Well, the writer-director Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi does feature another battle with AT-ATs on a snow-covered planet. Also: another Imperial/First Order effort to wipe out a rebel base with staggeringly powerful, space-based weapons; another subplot about a Jedi traveling to a distant planet to be mentored in the Force; another alien-filled cantina (actually, a casino this time around); another infiltration of an enemy vessel to turn off a crucial piece of hardware; another light-saber battle between former master and pupil; and a crucial scene that bears notable resemblance to the Luke-Vader-Emperor climax of Return of the Jedi. Yet Johnson tweaks these callbacks far more cunningly than his predecessor, J.J. Abrams, did his own in The Force Awakens: He flips their sequences, he toys with their meaning, and—in that crucial scene especially—he sets up certain expectations and then confounds them. Does the movie, like its predecessor, rely on familiar tropes a bit more than it should? Yes, I think it does. Is it, at a solid two-and-a-half hours, considerably longer than it needed to be? Yes, that too. But it’s still a pretty damn good movie, arguably the best the franchise has offered since Empire. The movie opens more or less where The Force Awakens left off. The young would-be Jedi, Rey (Daisy Ridley), has traveled to meet her first-trilogy counterpart, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), on a craggy island on a faraway world. The question is whether he will agree to serve as her mentor in the Force, as Obi-Wan and Yoda served him way back when. Alas, bitter and scraggly-bearded, Luke initially responds with a variation of “Get the hell off my lawn, kid!” But Johnson ultimately has more interesting things in store for both of these characters, as well as for Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), the Darth Vader wannabe who has a complex and tortured history with Luke, and who spends a good portion of the film telepathically linked with Rey. Meanwhile—this is a film whose multiple plot strands require a lot of meanwhiles—Rebel General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) and X-Wing pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) have their hands full with their fleet’s pursuit by a First Order armada they cannot escape thanks to its possession of a newfangled “tracking device.” The weakest of the major plot threads involves Stormtrooper-turned-rebel-hero Finn (John Boyega), who travels to (another) distant world to find a “codebreaker” who will help him infiltrate the First Order flagship and turn off the aforementioned tracker. (Yes, it might as well be a chapter titled “MacGuffin.”) Yet even this storyline is enlivened by the presence of Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), a gung-ho rebel mechanic who develops an all-too-adorable crush on Finn. Alas, they don’t get the codebreaker they’d hoped to recruit—who’s played by a devilishly mustachioed Justin Theroux for all of his five seconds on screen—and instead they have to settle for a nameless rogue played by Benicio Del Toro, whose louche insouciance is not as charming as he imagines it to be. But Del Toro is a rare disappointment among the cast, as Johnson—who directed the excellent Looper and the better-still Brick—has generally imbued his characters with lively wit and vigor. The tone is set early, with a comical “Hello, is someone on the line?”–style communications exchange between Poe and First Order General Hux. (The latter is played by Domhnall Gleeson, who has turned his knob for arrogant sneering up to 11.) Isaac’s Poe gets more to do than he did in the previous installment, though much of it is confined to bickering with his superiors, first Leia and then Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern), who dismisses him—not unreasonably—as a “trigger-happy flyboy.” Fisher is awfully good as the weary but stalwart, gravel-voiced Leia, making the actress’s tragically premature death last year after production had concluded especially heartbreaking. (She was reportedly intended to play a crucial role in the trilogy’s third installment, as Harrison Ford’s Han Solo did in the first and Hamill’s Luke does in this one.) Woven in among the inevitable space battles and blaster shootouts and narrow escapes, the most interesting relationships in the film are among the Jedi-triangle of Luke, Rey, and Kylo. “I came to this island to die,” Luke informs Rey early on. “The Jedi have to end.” The reasons for his despair involve his training of Kylo and the latter’s journey to the Dark Side, and they are unpacked not once, but twice—first by Luke and then by Kylo, with a critical difference in their competing accounts. Indeed, The Last Jedi probably does the best job of any Star Wars film of capturing the allure of the Dark Side and the spiritual turmoil that would lead to—and also result from—its embrace. This was, of course, the central goal of George Lucas’s prequel trilogy, at which it failed utterly, in part because Hayden Christensen, who played Anakin Skywalker (soon-to-become Vader), was a terrible actor. The same is not remotely true of Driver or Ridley, who share many of the strongest scenes in the film, even if they are frequently communicating with one another psychically from across the galaxy. The dramatic centerpiece of the film, however, finds them together with the First Order’s Supreme Leader Snoke (played in yet another motion-capture performance by the maestro of the medium, Andy Serkis). A great deal takes place during this scene—which also features a red-armored Praetorian Guard that is among the many visual highpoints of the film—and it would be unfair of me to reveal anything substantial. I will note, however, that Rey finally learns the secret of her parentage, and it may well not be what viewers anticipate. “Let the past die,” Kylo tells Rey at one point. “Kill it if you have to. That’s the only way to become what you were meant to be.” In the wake of the overly derivative reboot of The Force Awakens, I wanted Johnson to take this precise advice to heart in The Last Jedi more often than he did. But he did so often enough—and never more clearly than in an early scene with Kylo Ren. Rebuked by Snoke, his superior (“You’re no Vader. You’re just a child in a mask”), he takes his Vader-y helmet and smashes it to bits, never to be seen again. It’s an admirable statement of intent on Johnson’s part—and one that, not at all incidentally, enables him to make use of Driver’s full range as an actor. The Last Jedi is a fine film and a highly promising addition to the Star Wars canon. But I can’t help but hope that the next installment in the current trilogy—for which J.J. Abrams is slated to retake the reins—is willing to take still greater chances: to grasp more of the franchise’s storied past in its hands and fling it the way of Kylo’s helmet."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE,"Nothing less than the smartest, most nuanced, most ambitious Star Wars film ever made."
"Dec 14, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Sporadically thrilling, but overlong, exhausting, tonally uneven, and often dull."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE,"Johnson works in the somewhat limited palette that is Star Wars, but this middle chapter in the new trilogy also starts to break out in ways that should excite fans at the prospect of what's to come."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE," Si el final de El despertar de la Fuerza dejaba planteadas una decena de preguntas -si Rey es hija de Luke; si es una Jedi; quién es Snoke; por qué Luke se autoexilió; ¿Kylo Ren sufre remordimiento por haber asesinado a su padre?; alguna cuestión referida a Finn, en cuanto a la posibilidad incierta de que fuera un Jedi y/o pariente de los Skywalker-, no sucede lo mismo con el de Los últimos Jedi. Queda abierto, claro está, porque sabemos que es el jamón del medio de una nueva trilogía. Pero sólo hay tres puntos suspensivos. Los últimos Jedi tiene la que tal vez sea la mejor batalla de láser de la saga. Unos vuelcos en la trama que sorprenden al estilo “Luke, yo soy tu padre”, o la muerte de aquel personaje mítico que sucedía en El despertar de la Fuerza. Tiene entusiasmo, espectacularidad. También tiene baches. Tiene, como suele ser, tramas corriendo en paralelo, y tiene a Mark Hamill como un barbado y cuasi depresivo Luke, con más diálogo que nunca. Se dice que una buena película tiene que tener a un malvado a su altura. Aquí , los malvados, como en El despertar..., son Snoke y Kylo Ren. No se sabe de dónde previene el primero -tampoco por qué se corporizó con cara como de corteza de árbol-, y la conciencia del segundo es lo primordial. No en vano es nieto de Darth Vader, y sobrino de Luke. Es como tener en casa un padre de Boca y una madre de River, un tironeo en eterna disputa. En Los últimos Jedi, como siempre fue, es, y será en las nuevas trilogías que creará Rian Johnson, director de este Episodio VIII, todo sigue entre un lado y otro de la Fuerza, entre la Luz y la Oscuridad. Pero estas películas, y sus spin-offs, están formando a nuevos espectadores/fans, y por eso se crean personajes, un nuevo linaje de ambos lados de la Fuerza -recordemos que el público infanto juvenil es el target de Hollywood- y por eso están los porgs en el planeta Ahch-To, como antes los ewoks, que apuntan a la risa de los más pequeños-. Hay una explicación resumida de lo que es y significa la Fuerza para los recién llegados. Y la entrega y la solidaridad, en síntesis, el sacrificio es un bien cuyo valor es inmenso -recordar Rogue One-, algo que aquí se redobla. Hay apariciones sorpresivas -nada de spoilers-, muertes inesperadas –menos aún- y un Benicio del Toro como un hacker a la Lando Calrissian en El Imperio contraataca, a la que tanto se asemeja en su constitución Los últimos Jedi. Con todo, Los últimos Jedi tiene sus cuotas de humor y de ironía (vean lo que hace Luke con el sable láser que le ofrece Rey; escuchen lo que el Líder Supremo Snoke le pide a Kylo que haga con su máscara; los bichitos de planeta donde se refugia Luke); y hay mucho autohomenaje para los que siguen la saga desde hace 40 años. La complejidad no es una palabra que cuadre demasiado por aquí. Es cierto: Kylo Ren, antes Ben, se debate con su conciencia, pero Luke “leyenda y fracasado”, según sus propias palabras,que por algo se refugió “en el lugar más indescifrable de la galaxia” tampoco la tiene fácil. Rian Johnson no parece querer tomar vuelo propio ni ponerle una marca personal a la saga, como sí logró J. J. Abrams en El despertar de la Fuerza. Hasta parece como encorsetado, con las riendas firmes del filme, pero sin soltarlo para que cabalgue en libertad. La línea argumental de Los últimos Jedi podría resumirse en pocas palabras -los rebeldes están en una nave y son acosados y perseguidos, a punto de ser eliminados por la Primera Orden; Rey quiere saber “qué lugar ocupo en esta historia”; y lo que decíamos al comienzo: las preguntas que dejaba en suspenso el final de El despertar...-. La aparición de los personajes femeninos refuerza también el cambio de época, sumado a Finn (negro) y Rose (asiática), aunque Rey sea la que de aquí en más se ponga la saga sobre sus espaldas. El empoderamiento de Leia, sabemos, no podrá seguir tras el fallecimiento de Carrie Fisher. Y cuando aparece Leia es difícil no sentir algo similar a la compasión, cuando en verdad debería brindarnos otro valor. Con el correr del tiempo, Los últimos Jedi tal vez resurja como la película necesaria, imprescindible entre unas y otras de la saga. Mientras tanto, en el tiempo presente, es una película bien, pero bien bombástica, algo alargada (152 minutos; no pasa nada en los créditos finales), y que por momentos nos lleva al borde del precipicio."

"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE," A review of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the latest in the intergalactic franchise. Fans are especially excited to see what happens to General Leia, played by Carrie Fisher, who died earlier this year. ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" opens this weekend in more theaters than any ""Star Wars"" movie ever has. It is episode eight in a series that promises to go on pretty much forever. And while you might think that would lead the filmmakers to serve up more of the same, critic Bob Mondello says, without spoilers, that ""The Last Jedi"" feels surprisingly fresh. BOB MONDELLO, BYLINE: Gotta say, I was nervous. Nobody who sat through those lackluster prequels with Jar Jar Binks will ever take the ""Star Wars"" formula completely for granted. Fans held their breath for this new trilogy, hoping J.J. Abrams could make ""The Force Awakens"" fun. And he did and left us hanging with freedom fighter Rey holding out a lightsaber to Luke Skywalker, begging him with her eyes to come back and make things OK, which is more or less where this one starts. So why was I nervous again... MONDELLO: ...Because ""Force Awakens"" was all about nostalgia, and you can't keep a series interesting by doing the same thing over and over. So ""Last Jedi"" was going to have to go someplace different, and I didn't trust where. MONDELLO: That voice is Luke's, inviting Rey to explore a more complex notion of the force and how it works in the universe than she's had in her head. And the filmmakers are asking the audience to do that, too, without giving up any of the fun of droids and lightsabers. ""Star Wars"" has always been a story about darkness and light, first order and resistance. But ""The Last Jedi"" is all about grey areas, shadows, bad guys who may not be all bad, friends who sometimes make terrible choices - also of course about planet-blasting dreadnoughts, storm troopers, wookiees and a critter called a porg. MONDELLO: Porgs look like puffins and will soon be under every Christmas tree on this planet, as opposed to the film's planets, which are richly textured digital wonderlands - an intergalactic Monte Carlo, say, or a desert world that turns into a giant red and white Etch A Sketch during battles. Director Rian Johnson, whose previous movies have been tiny by comparison, marshals special effects as if he's been dreaming this ""Star Wars"" installment since he was a kid. MONDELLO: And he probably has. Johnson also marshals sharp performances, especially from the saga's veterans. Mark Hamill's curmudgeonly Luke Skywalker seems to be channeling his inner-Han Solo at times and keeps the brother-sister act going with Carrie Fisher, whose death last year renders Leia's every utterance bittersweet. The youngsters spend most of their time whipping up the action, Oscar Isaac and John Boyega ever-impetuous as Poe and Finn... MONDELLO: There are new folks, too, as you'll want to discover for yourself in a story where the John Williams score intensifies not just galaxy-defining battles but things as mundane as grabbing dinner. Nothing in ""The Last Jedi"" is allowed to be mundane, including the places the filmmakers take the story. NPR transcripts are created on a rush deadline by an NPR contractor.

"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE," A Star Wars film does not stand alone, and in the new Disney era, each film has a specific role. The Force Awakens was to prove the franchise could survive without George Lucas. Rogue One explored the galaxy behind the Skywalker legacy. The Last Jedi has become the passing of the torch, both narratively and creatively. Contrary to early rumors, the eighth film in the core story does not begin exactly where The Force Awakens left off, with fledgling Force wielder Rey (Ridley) confronting the long-missing Luke Skywalker (Hamill), determined to drag him from his self-imposed exile. Instead, the last remnants of the Resistance fleet under General Leia Organa (Fisher) and hot-shot flier Poe Dameron (Isaac) are being pursued by Supreme Leader Snoke (Serkis), General Hux (Gleeson), and the fascist fanboys of the First Order. Straining at the leash is Kylo Ren (Driver), fresh from patricide and surlier than ever. When events finally turn to Rey, her journey of discovery is less about her own path than finding out why the man who felled the Empire has gone into seclusion. Meanwhile, the team is split further, with First Order defector Finn (Boyega) dispatched on a new mission with engineer Rose (Tran). Johnsonâs selection as writer/director raised eyebrows, since his signature was neo-noir films like Brick and Looper. However, Looperâs second story arc, of a superpowered child who could be demon or savior, set the themes that he revisits here. Where the earlier films dealt with destiny, Rey and Ren both live in a galaxy of ambiguity, and thatâs Johnsonâs mÃ©tier. Amongst the ecstatic reviews of The Force Awakens, there was also a contingent happy that Abrams got the franchise going again, but glad he was only around for one film. Whereas the Lucas films referenced other movies and legends, Abrams was simply self-referential to the first six, with Ren reduced to Anakin-lite and Snoke just a cardboard Emperor Palpatine. Johnson sets the entire mythos on a new path, while finally fleshing out Abramsâ characters. Where Force Awakensâ Poe was all cardboard enthusiasm, here heâs a gung-ho fool, a flyboy who thinks that everything can be solved with a few bombers and some quips â strategies that soon send him into conflict with Amilyn Holdo (Dern), Leiaâs number two. Johnson also shows himself to be a master of visuals. Unlike Abrams, whose style merely cobbles together notes from the original films, Johnson finally delivers the iconic moments that have defined the franchise. And yet the imperfections are frustrating, and still show Abramsâ influence. Finn and Roseâs trip to a gambling planet â basically a space Monaco â flits between light fun and on-the-nose political narrative. Some sight gags stink like a farting Eopie; and there are purloined visual cues, like a rerun of the flight through the Death Star II. However, there are larger structural problems: While Johnsonâs final act emulates the classic Star Wars balance of multiple strands â overlapping and flowing together â he never quite catches the tight elegance of the Battle of Endor. But these are minor quibbles compared to the depth, wonder, and sense of heroism that The Last Jedi brings back. While Abrams peddled name recognition, Johnson understands that the classic characters have to reignite the torch before they can pass it on, and gives both Leia and Luke defining moments. While Fisherâs memorable performance as the sardonic but sentimental princess-turned-senator-turned-general is given additional poignancy by her death, it does not need it to be heartbreaking. As for Hamill, his aging Luke â despairing, self-destructive, and isolated â may be his finest performance to date. The good news is that Johnson will stay with the Star Wars universe, creating his own trilogy away from the Skywalker bloodline. The bad news is that Abrams takes over the reins again in the next installment. With The Last Jedi, Johnson breathed life into his pastiche. Now the question is whether Abrams can give the saga the ending it deserves.

"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE," The complaints about Star Wars: The Force Awakens must have been heard and taken to heart as its sequel, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, is a substantially better film. Star Wars: The Force Awakens felt more like a rehash of key events from Star Wars: A New Hope than it did an original entry in the blockbuster sci-fi film franchise. Star Wars: The Last Jedi pays homage to the previous films while weaving a completely new tale that won’t be confused with prior Star Wars movies. The events in The Last Jedi take place just minutes after the end of The Force Awakens. Rey hopes to impress on Luke Skywalker how much he’s needed in the Rebellion while learning all she can about The Force and Jedi. Elsewhere, General Leia Organa continues to take on the First Order and General Hux, while Kylo Ren does Supreme Leader Snoke’s bidding. Poe acts against orders and is stripped of his command, only to continue to disobey for what he believes is the good of the Rebellion. Finn teams up with Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) for a secret mission, aided by a criminal named DJ (Benicio Del Toro) with specific skills. And while all of that matters, what’s really important is how our heroes band together to take on the First Order in epic action scenes that are some of the best of the franchise. Working in Star Wars: The Last Jedi’s favor is a new sense of confidence on screen from the main players: Daisy Ridley as Rey, John Boyega as Finn, and Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. Introductions are over and with Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the personalities of these three pivotal characters are more fully fleshed out. The character arcs are more fulfilling in this sequel, particularly Ridley’s Rey. We cheered her on in The Force Awakens, but with The Last Jedi she cements herself as a force to be reckoned with and a heroine to look up to. She’s flawed and fallible, but loyal to a fault and steadfast in her beliefs. Plus, she’s a fierce fighter. Kylo Ren is surprisingly sympathetic, to a point, and Adam Driver seems to have a real grasp on the character’s struggles. John Boyega’s Finn has earned hero status among the Rebellion, but he’s willing to risk everything to ensure the safety of Rey. Daisy Ridley’s Rey and John Boyega’s Finn have separate missions for much of the film, but when they do share screen time they recapture that special chemistry between the unlikely allies and now close friends. Oscar Isaac is terrific at playing cocky, and Poe Cameron is even more so in The Last Jedi than he was in The Force Awakens. Isaac seems to really relish this role and his enjoyment in being a part of the Star Wars world is evident on screen. General Leia Organa admires his passion and flying skills, but is forced to demote him because of his difficulty following orders. Poe’s commitment to the Resistance is unwavering, but his leadership skills leave much to be desired. The film’s also a fitting tribute to one of the most recognizable fictional characters of the past 40 years in movies. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is dedicated to the beloved Carrie Fisher whose impact and influence as Princess Leia was felt by innumerable young girls who embraced the strong female role model. Fisher’s General Leia is central to The Last Jedi and some scenes have a preternatural vibe, as though her sudden passing was somehow acknowledged before it occurred. (I realize that makes little sense, but when you watch the film there are two key scenes that raise goosebumps.) As a diehard fan of the original trilogy, it was fantastic to see Mark Hamill once again actively involved in a Star Wars film. We’ve watched Hamill’s Luke Skywalker grow from a 19-year-old thrust into the role of a leader of the Rebellion to a Master Jedi who’s cut himself off from outside contact by isolating himself on a remote island. Star Wars: The Last Jedi reveals how he’s been passing the years spent away from his friends in the Resistance and advances Luke’s hero’s journey. Star Wars: The Last Jedi also features great performances from supporting actors Domnhall Gleeson, who’s given much more to do this time around, Star Wars newcomer Laura Dern, and from Billie Lourd as Lieutenant Connix. Lourd, sporting her mom’s Princess Leia twin buns hairstyle, is elevated from barely seen and soon forgotten in The Force Awakens to a decent-sized role in this sequel. Writer/director Rian Johnson was clearly the right choice to take charge of The Last Jedi. Johnson keeps the film flying along, mixing in the right measure of humor, heartbreak, and intense action sequences. Johnson also came up with the perfect amount of screen time for two of the film’s most talked about new creatures: the porgs and the crystal foxes. The porgs are just insanely cute and their expressions are incredibly adorable. Even Chewbacca’s won over by the delightful seabird critters who were inspired by real-life puffins. (Did you know a baby porg is a porglet?) The crystal foxes are officially known as vulptices (the singular is vulptex) and show up toward the end of The Last Jedi. Although they have very limited screen time, their contribution to the story is huge. The porgs are a great merchandising gimmick and add some comic relief (you laugh just looking at them), but the crystal foxes are much more integral to the actual plot. Star Wars: The Last Jedi delivers the Star Wars film we wanted with The Force Awakens but didn’t get. There are twists you won’t see coming and just when you think you’ve figured everything out, Rian Johnson pulls a rabbit out of his hat. This new trip to a galaxy far, far away is entertaining, fast-paced, and leaves us feeling hopeful about the state of the Star Wars franchise."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE,"""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" could very well be the definite evolution of the series yet."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE," When I was a young nerdlinger playing with Star Wars toys in the backyard (OK, indoors, let’s be honest) I had a very specific fantasy. Not just having Chewbacca as a best friend ... in the movie in my mind, Jedi Knights would defeat their foes by taking their at-rest lightsabers, pressing the hilt against someone’s head and then activating its emitter. Man, wouldn’t that be a savage way to take out some Mos Eisley scum and villainy? But surely I’d never get a chance to see something that awesome in a Star Wars movie, right? Well, with The Last Jedi I finally got to see my dreams come true. More importantly, in ways far cooler (complete with tension and dramatic purpose and story advancement) than I ever could imagine. Rian Johnson, writer and director of this film, took my Star Wars reveries and served them back to me with vast improvements. While there are some solid nuggets of deep-cut easter eggs for hardcore fans, what is so extraordinary about The Last Jedi is that this is the first post-Lucas Star Wars film that feels free to dance to its own beat. It is thrilling that this franchise, which looked like it was lumbering after some behind-the-scenes woe , is evolving in its prime storyline. The callbacks, reappearances of old friends and in-jokes surely gave me what physicians of the day now diagnose as “the feels,” but they were not my favorite part of the movie. Instead I was more thrilled that this isn’t just a trace-over job; The Last Jedi, truly, is its own movie. But still, what were the best fan-service moments? Well, the biggie was R2-D2 trying to convince Luke Skywalker to get out of his gloomy place and help Rey (and Chewbacca) return to General Leia’s Rebel Base and help defeat the First Order. Luke has been living like the Man of Aran in Ahch-To, home to the first Jedi Temple, a pretty spartan place with a very limited library. When Luke rejects Rey’s plea, Artoo turns the Dejarik tables on him by replaying Princess Leia’s original hologram: “Help me, Obi Wan Kenobi. You’re my only hope.” It’s a broad beat meant to pull on everyone’s heartstrings. (Indeed, everything featuring Leia has some extra gravitas, knowing that Carrie Fisher died so soon after filming.) Moments earlier, however, seasoned fans had their minds scrambled by Luke’s glib comment about running into battle with a “laser sword.” A laser sword is, of course, something only a dunce would call a lightsaber, which is why it is particularly galling that George Lucas, the man who lives to aggravate Star Wars fans, says this in interviews from time to time. The term, originally written as “lazerswords,” originates from early drafts of Lucas’s first scripts, but it got a canonical mention from (hold your nose, everyone) young Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker in The Phantom Menace. Now Rian Johnson has stolen it back! Ahch-To is home to the adorable puffin-like pups called the Porgs, and also some enormous sea-bird Nessie-like hybrid creatures that, if you squeeze their nipples offer up milk. (No, I’m not joking.) Part of Luke’s morning routine is fetching himself a bottle and, yes, I’m proud to report that the milk has a tinge of blue. Not quite as blue as bantha milk, but the color is definitely noticeable. Another important color in the film is red, and Supreme Leader Snoke’s lair is straight out of Akira Kurosawa’s Kagemusha. Kurosawa’s The Hidden Fortress is a known influence on Lucas’ original, so I suspect that these scenes (which eventually go full samurai) are, in a way, a homage to the homage. George Lucas was an executive producer on the 1980 Japanese film. While we’re talking about Rian Johnson the cinephile, there’s also a modified quote from Sam Peckinpah’s The Wild Bunch. Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron turns to his posse during a tense moment and says “if they move, stun ‘em,” which is definitely the more family friendly version of that uttered in the 1969 western. There’s an interesting motif in The Last Jedi that involves little totems. Two involve a new character, the engineer Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) who has a crescent-shaped medallion and a ring that flashes the rebel symbol. The medallion (similar to one her sister carried) ends up having an unexpected and humorous in-story use, and the the ring becomes a leave-behind for a next generation of the Resistance. Then there are some gold, hanging dice taken from the Millennium Falcon that, I have to admit, I never noticed before. This is The Last Jedi at its peak. It finds something that already existed in the mythos, gives it new significance and, along the way, likely inspires a kid in the audience who 30 years from now (as there will never be star peace) to reintroduce it to awestruck audiences when we cheer for Episode XXIII."

Star Wars: Episode VIII — The Last Jedi is a strange beast: a swashbuckling action movie that is deeply skeptical of derring-do; a middle movie that works better as riff and commentary on the original source material than as a sequel to its immediate predecessor. The Star Wars films have always been two things, not always successfully. On the one hand, they were old-fashioned space opera in the swashbuckling tradition of Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon, but better (except when they weren’t). On the other hand, they were epic mythopoeia, with roots in J.R.R. Tolkien and T.H. White, shaped by the literary theories of Joseph Campbell. The original trilogy did both well, often brilliantly. The prequel trilogy did neither very well, but enough inspiration remains to mark them as a continuation of sorts of the same creative endeavor. In the Disney age of Star Wars, J.J. Abrams’ The Force Awakens tried, too derivatively, to recapitulate the flavor of the original trilogy. By contrast, Gareth Edwards’ Rogue One jettisoned the mythopoeic and even partially deconstructed the traditional heroism of prior films. The Last Jedi offers humor, excitement and spectacle, with space battles and lightsaber duels. The Force Awakens had all those things, but The Last Jedi also has fresh story beats and new ideas. It also has Luke Skywalker. Mark Hamill and the late Carrie Fisher, in her final performance as Leia, both get at least one dramatic moment of fan-service awesomeness, though Luke’s is crucial to the plot and Leia’s isn’t, alas. There’s a payoff of sorts going back to Return of the Jedi and an epic confrontation like nothing in any previous Star Wars movie. To this we can add an increasingly diverse portrait of the Resistance, from an ingenuous maintenance worker named Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran, of Vietnamese descent), who’s briefly starstruck by John Boyega’s runaway stormtrooper Finn, to the pink-haired Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern), a character reminiscent of Mon Mothma, but with a more pivotal role. Daisy Ridley’s Rey is back, of course, and it turns out that her key relationship in this film is with neither Finn nor Luke, but Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren — a dynamic that gives both their characters what interest they have. Oscar Isaac’s hotshot pilot Poe Dameron would be the film’s swashbuckling hero, if there were one. Is this enough? I’m sure it will be for many fans. Yet as the complicated, messy plot unfolds, the lack of a larger vision in this new trilogy becomes more glaring. The Force Awakens wasn’t a great film, but The Last Jedi makes it worse in its failure to pay off or follow up on the first film’s mysteries and promises. (I’ll try to avoid overt spoilers, but if you care deeply about remaining totally unspoiled, stop reading now.) Start with Supreme Leader Snoke, the mysterious computer-generated leader of the First Order played by Andy Serkis. Introduced in The Force Awakens as a giant hologram, he returns to this film as a sort of amalgam of the Emperor and Darth Vader — except he’s ultimately a zero. To the extent that The Last Jedi has a villain, and to the extent that Snoke is that villain, it’s a close call whether The Last Jedi or Justice League has the year’s dullest, least consequential villain. Then there’s the question of Rey’s origins, her extraordinary raw capacity for the Force, and her apparent connection to Luke, whose lightsaber called to her from Maz Kanata’s cellar and showed her troubling visions of Luke and Kylo Ren. “I’ve seen this raw strength only once before,” Luke tells Rey in this film, referring to Ren. “It didn’t scare me enough then. It does now.” Indeed, Rey’s power may be greater than Ren’s; she’s a match for him, despite her lack of training and his training by Snoke. Ren, aka Ben Solo, is the grandson of Anakin Skywalker himself, the chosen one apparently conceived by the Force. Force sensitivity runs in families, which is why Vader’s offspring Luke and Leia have it and why Ren has it. What, then, of Rey’s missing family, for whom she waited so tenaciously on Jakku in The Force Awakens? What is her connection to Luke? Suffice to say, The Last Jedi dispatches these questions in something like the least satisfying way possible. While playing like a rousing continuation and extension of the Star Wars saga, The Last Jedi is also a deconstruction and even a critique. When Luke bitterly remarks that the legacy of the Jedi is failure, hypocrisy and hubris, it’s hard to argue the point. Rather than maturing into Kenobi-like venerable authority, Luke has all too plausibly aged from a sometimes petulant young novice into a morose, disillusioned failed teacher. Like Obi-Wan before him, he trained a promising student — in this case Ben Solo — who went to the Dark Side, destroying the next generation of Jedi. The dramatic action in Star Wars has generally been structured around various heroic challenges calling for bold action and derring-do: rescuing the princess, confronting the villain and blowing up or shutting down the bad guys’ stuff (Death Stars, tractor beams, shield generators, droid control ships, etc.). The Last Jedi subverts this by repeatedly making such heroic gambits the wrong move — especially when male characters are in favor of bold action and female characters aren’t. Poe Dameron’s heroics in any other Star Wars film would win accolades and promotion, but here he’s disobeying Leia’s orders and runs afoul of Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo. Poe is always looking for chinks in the enemy’s armor; Amilyn’s priority is strategic retreat. She considers Poe a reckless risk-taker; he considers her timid and passive. It’s a provocative complication that Poe is in the wrong. It’s not just defying Amilyn’s rank that makes Poe wrong. At one point Finn sets himself a desperate task, but is thwarted by a female character who is not his superior. “I saved your life,” she tells him. Yet we’ve already seen just this kind of self-sacrificial gambit successfully realized — by a woman. Why is Finn’s effort unworthy? I’m glad not to see him die, but it’s a problem that Johnson can’t find anything else significant for Finn to do either. Of all the major characters, he’s the most useless here. Finally comes an apparent exception: a showdown perhaps more dramatic than anything since Luke first crossed lightsabers with Darth Vader in The Empire Strikes Back. This is by far the most effective and consequential sequence of any of the Disney Star Wars films. Yet there’s a twist that is both brilliant and at the same time undercuts the apparent celebration of derring-do. Doubtless the Resistance will not always be retreating, and traditional swashbuckling will probably return to the Star Wars universe. There’s certainly a case for one movie in which bold gambits to blow up the bad guys’ stuff aren’t the way to go. In the long run I’m less concerned about Poe’s heroic cred than I am the still-underdeveloped characters of Rey and especially poor Finn. Oh, and what about the “first Jedi temple” we heard about? We see it, and the original Jedi texts. The movie puts even less stock in them than in Snoke. A voice wiser than Luke’s declares that the Jedi texts contain nothing that Rey doesn’t already have. Really? Then the Jedi religion is a con. P.S. Since this review was first published, many helpful readers have brought to my attention a fleeting shot that offers another meaning to the words of that “wiser voice” mentioned in the last paragraph. (Warning: I am no longer avoiding spoilers.) First, whether the alternate meaning proposed by this shot is confirmed will depend on Episode IX. Once again, one film writes checks that the sequel will have to make good — or not.  Second, this revelation just raises new problems. For one thing, why does Force Ghost Yoda deceive Luke yet again? Do Jedis never stop spinning the truth “from a certain point of view,” even when they are Force Ghosts talking to Jedi Masters?  For another, if destroying the first Jedi temple isn’t about bring an end to the Jedi lore or way, what can it possibly be about? What’s the point? Please don’t tell me it was about teaching Luke detachment. Of all the lessons that Master Luke might have to learn at this point, detachment can hardly rank high on the list. For that matter, I would really like to think that Force Ghost Yoda has recovered somewhat from the disordered attachment to detachment seen in the past. Correction: A sentence in this review has been corrected to reflect the fact that Poe Dameron is demoted for disobeying Leia’s orders, not those of Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo as originally stated. This is the story of a heroine who believes that every choice we make for good or evil matters to God and to his plan. The Holy Father reminded the faithful this truth for each person to take to heart: ‘For Christ, I am important, irreplaceable, worth the infinite price of his life.’ Copyright © 2024 EWTN News, Inc.

"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE," This review is  a no-spoilers zone, so let’s cut to the chase: The Last Jedi – Episode VIII of the Star Wars saga – is simply stupendous, a volcano of creative ideas in full eruption. Writer-director Rian Johnson, known for indies such as Looper and Brick, eases into epic filmmaking like a pro. The Star Wars universe is the best toy box a fanboy could ever wish for, and Johnson makes sure that Jedi is bursting at the seams with knockout fun surprises, marvelous adventure and shocking revelations that will leave your head spinning. Even those few jaded doubters, the ones still reeling from the disastrous trilogy of prequels perpetrated by George Lucas, will roar like Wookies and holler, “Holy shit!” Want lightsaber duels,  X-wing dogfights, exotic creatures (oh, those crystal ice-critters!), criss-crossing family bloodlines (“Who’s your daddy?” gets asked a lot), high-end FX and lowdown farce? It’s all here. But Johnson takes it to the next level, leading us through so many trap doors and blind alleys that we can’t tell the dark side from the light. Heroes die and villains thrive … and then it’s the reverse. That’s the point of the movie, which brims over with characters on a tightrope.  The plot picks up where director J.J. Abrams left off in 2015’s The Force Awakens. The Resistance, led by Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) – she’s now a general – is again fighting the evil First Order, commanded by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis in peak motion-capture form). Resistance fighter Rey (Daisy Ridley) has traveled to the isolated island of Ahch-To, the site of the Jedi Order’s first temple. The goal: to find AWOL Jedi master Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and drag his depressed hermit ass back to save the galaxy and whip sense into his conflicted nephew. That would be Ben Solo, aka Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who last time out killed his own father and now gives his mom, Leia, no end of heartache.   Just when you think you know where this movie is going, Johnson pulls the rug out from under you. Old friends are back, including R2-D2, C-3PO and the immortal Chewbacca. Ex Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega), proud to be called “rebel scum,” teams up with newbie Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), a mechanic with skills to plan a daring rescue for the Resistance. Benicio del Toro is the life of the party as a thief and codebreaker no one can trust. Fighter pilot Poe Dameron (a dashing Oscar Isaac) has his own misgivings about Vice-Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), the autocrat who takes command when Leia is knocked out of commission. The Last Jedi marks a sad farewell to Fisher, who died a year ago and whose slyly comic and deeply felt performance shows again why she’s irreplaceable.   OK, there are nitpicks. It’s simply too long at two hours and 36 minutes – and sometimes too damn much. The screen is so crowded with character and incident that you might need a scorecard to keep up. But the way Johnson, who’s slated to direct three more Star Wars films with unfamiliar characters, balances the skyrocketing action with tender feeling keeps you emphatically  in the game. The actors are stellar in big roles and small. Ridley and Driver knock it out of the park as Rey and Ren, two characters drawn together by a Force neither understands.  Still, The Last Jedi belongs to Hamill in a portrayal that cuts to the core of what Star Wars means to a generation of dreamers looking to the heavens. In the 40 years since the actor first played Luke Skywalker, we’ve followed him from callow youth to Jedi master. But it’s here that Hamill gives the performance of his career, nailing every nuance of an iconic role and rewarding the emotional investment we’ve made in him. There are people, places and things you’ll have to say goodbye to in Episode VIII, even the laughs are tinged with tears. Never fear. You’re in hyper-skilled hands with Johnson who makes sure you leave the multiplex feeling euphoric. The middle part of the current trilogy, The Last Jedi ranks with the very best Star Wars epics (even the pinnacle that is The Empire Strikes Back) by pointing the way ahead to a next generation of skywalkers – and, thrillingly, to a new hope."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE," Hold onto your battle helmets – while two years may have passed for us earthlings between the release of The Force Awakens (aka Episode VII) in 2015 and this follow-up, in the Star Wars universe it is pretty much the same day, with events picking up immediately where they left off. Which means that wannabe Jedi Rey (Ridley) is on a remote island making first contact with Luke Skywalker (Hamill), and former stormtrooper Finn (Boyega) is napping in a coma. Meanwhile resistance leader Leia (Fisher), pilot Poe Dameron (Isaac) and pals are fighting a losing battle against the First Order, led by creepy Snoke (Serkis) pouty General Hux (Gleeson) and scarred Kylo Ren (a superb Driver). Writer/director Rian Johnson (best known for the superb time travel thriller Looper) takes the baton (or should that be lightsaber?) from Force Awakens’ JJ Abrams and gloriously sprints with it, opening the movie with an impressive space battle sequence and then scattering his characters throughout the galaxy, each with their own adventure stories that are destined to intertwine later on. There is betrayal, hope, desperation, a daring escape and surprising alliances in the sharply scripted plot, and while a few moments are too slow – the initial interaction between Rey and Luke drags as he refuses to have anything to do with her but won’t explain why – at about the time that Finn wakes up, things move into lightspeed and the adventure really takes off. A shade darker than The Force Awakens (but, as an aid to parents, nowhere near as nasty as Revenge Of The Sith), The Last Jedi does have some lighter moments. There’s cuteness from adorable love-‘em-or-hate-‘em (we love them) Porgs – creatures on Luke’s island that look like gerbils crossed with owls, and laughs as Finn and fellow rebel Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) embark on a secret mission without really knowing what the hell they are doing. There are new locations to dazzle us – including a stunning salt mining planet that is so red underneath it looks like it bleeds – and new characters to meet, including Laura Dern’s Vice Admiral Holdo and Benicio Del Toro’s roguish DJ, and Johnson deftly blends all the elements, turning up the tension and the action as the movie progresses until, about two-thirds of the way in, you’ll realise you have been sitting on the edge of your seat for at least an hour. In the end, however, the memories that will stay with you are of the two Star Wars veterans, outshining all their talented costars in every scene they are in. Carrie Fisher, in what tragically was to be her final role, is every bit the princess, leader, and voice of reason to her rebels. But the true star of The Last Jedi is Mark Hamill, giving the performance of his career as the anguished, isolated, tortured former Jedi Master. His scenes are worth the ticket price alone."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE," Failure takes precedence over the force in Star Wars: The Last Jedi. The series, now eight episodes deep, is still stuck on repeat in a galaxy far, far away. As the events of A New Hope echoed through Force Awakens, The Last Jedi takes its cues from Empire Strikes Back in reverse. But for the first time in the series, the old guard are starting to realise they’ve made a huge mistake. Star Wars is a series obsessed with mythologising the righteous exploits of the heroic Jedi and putting pressure on the next generation to save the galaxy. As history keeps on repeating itself – you can count it in Death Stars – writer and director Rian Johnson (Brick, Looper), scrutinises Star Wars’ mythology and its themes of mentorship and legacy in an attempt to forge a new path. The Last Jedi is muddled by bombast, but finds significance in the art of failure as a means to an end for a new beginning (again) for Star Wars. The Last Jedi picks up right after the end of The Force Awakens, with the Resistance on the run from The New Order and Rey (Daisy Ridley) face-to-face with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). While Rey asks for Skywalker’s help to understand the force, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) plan to wipe the Resistance from the universe. The Last Jedi is unlike its predecessors in style. Johnson brings a fresh approach to Star Wars that is lavish in odd details, strange creatures (the penguin-like Porgs rule) and vibrant crimson colours. Unlike The Force Awakens, you can feel Johnson’s voice as a storyteller, and he isn’t afraid to let Star Wars get weird, although there’s a haphazard sense of self-awareness when there are gags at the expense of the film rather than playing intuitively to each character. Disney is developing a bad habit of making their films comical, which is irritating in the desperation to please the widest possible audience. What’s most striking is Johnson’s use of close ups. As the film turns toward introspection, Johnson frames stunning close ups that become the perfect portrait of each character. The director of Empire Strikes Back, Irvin Kershner said: “There’s nothing more interesting than the landscape of the human face.” Johnson applies the same methodology to The Last Jedi and there are wonderful contrasts between young and old, hopeful and weary, clarity and anger. Ridley and Driver are dynamic in scenes where they’re responding to each other in a ‘force group chat’ of the mind, and Ridley continues to be a bright spark as a new addition to the series while Driver’s conflicted, tantrum prone Kylo Ren is still the ultimate Darth Vader fanboy experiencing his own personal backlash. The rest of the newbies quake a little, mainly Finn (John Boyega), Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern). It’s nothing to do with each performance, there’s enough charisma in the group to create a new sun. The Last Jedi is compartmentalised into sub plots that trash the film’s momentum and each character’s stake in the plot. Johnson can never wrangle the scope as he pushes the film beyond the constraints of the central story. You do get a peek at the politics of the galaxy during a visit to a casino planet where it becomes clear why the wealthy citizens support galactic conflict. And for once it’s good to see why a rebellion/resistance matters besides the literal takedown of the Empire/New Order because they’re evil fascists. But the heart of The Last Jedi is Luke and Leia (Carrie Fisher). Both Hamill and Fisher give the film gravitas beyond nostalgic fan service. Leia is the voice of reason amongst hot-headed Rebels who encourages strategic moves over risky heroics. If a rebellion is to survive it needs to fight smarter, not harder; there’s no use in having dead heroes. The Last Jedi is obsessed with acts of defiance and sacrifice as symbols of hope. There’s a moment where a hyper drive is weaponised against the First Order and it’s breathtaking. But Leia is forever the realist trying to scrape together the lessons learnt from loss. Without her, they’d be no one left to fight in the rebellion and Fisher is a noble presence. Skywalker’s story arc subverts the hero worship of Star Wars perfectly. Skywalker’s admission of the mistakes of the Jedi order are heartbreaking, including his attempt to train a new generation, but it’s cathartic seeing failure embraced and the steps taken to burn the system down. Legacy is overrated in the context of the Skywalker family tree across eight films. We’re used to being told about the strict paths to the light or dark side of the force, but Skywalker’s admission of failure, and the clarity that follows, gives The Last Jedi its most emotionally charged moments. The Last Jedi is a mess at times, gargantuan in scope, marred by sub plotting and an expanding roster of characters it can’t sustain with plot, but it’s divine in its smallest moments. When the camera is focused in close-up on the weathered face of Luke Skywalker admitting he got it wrong, The Last Jedi feels like the series learning from its mistakes and trying to forge something new."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE,"The dialogue is peppered with droll admissions and Star Wars-savvy sarcasm, which helps to prick the heroic sweep so common to these trilogies."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE,"Where J.J. Abrams sought to give this new trilogy a firm but predictable foundation to build upon, Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi is a risk-taker. This is to be applauded absolutely."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE," With a sumptuous colour palette, interwoven plot lines, and unexpected humour, writer-director Rian Johnson (Looper) has assuredly marked Star Wars, Episode VIII: The Last Jedi as his own – a new chapter in the Skywalker saga that is at once deeply familiar and unique. Part two in the sequel trilogy picks up right where The Force Awakens left off, with the orphaned heroine Rey (Daisy Ridley) attempting to lure the only remaining Jedi, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), out of self-imposed exile. Meanwhile, the last remnants of the Resistance flee a resurgent New Order. The film opens with as dramatic a sequence as the franchise has ever seen, delivering an exhilarating and poignant battle that introduces a spectacularly menacing new class of space ship known as the Dreadnaught, pits ace pilot Poe (Oscar Isaac) against his superiors, and sets in motion a race against the clock. Unable to escape without detection and with only shallow reserves of fuel remaining until the New Order catches up with them, the depleted Rebel fleet limps through space like the Orca from Jaws – a hapless, crumbling ship pursued by a killer whose only remaining hurdle is time. But as ingenious as this setup may be, it also gives rise to the film's most pointless subplot. After waking from his coma, Finn (John Boyega) contrives a means by which he can disable the New Order's tracking device, albeit one that requires him to sneak off the fleeing vessel, travel to a Monaco-styled casino planet, track down a master codebreaker and infiltrate the enemy's warship undetected. This enormous MacGuffin sees Boyega partnered with the charming Kelly Marie Tran as Rose Tico, a Resistance engineer low in status but high in pluck. The problem is that their side adventure does absolutely nothing to advance the actual story. Finn's reluctant hero arc was already covered off in The Force Awakens, while Rose's belief in (and commitment to) the righteousness of the rebel cause is perfectly encapsulated in her fantastic introductory scene but goes unchallenged thereafter. Benicio Del Toro also pops up, then shortly thereafter departs, in an entirely forgettable cameo. Ultimately they all end up right where they began, having effected no material change except to deliver a heavy-handed critique of war profiteers. The great shame is that in both Boyega and Tran you have oodles of charisma, heart and talent that deserve scenes of equal calibre. Instead, they chew up time in a movie already guilty of using far too much of it. Thankfully the rest of the cast fares better. Hamill, Ridley and Adam Driver's Kylo Ren find themselves entangled in a fascinating and emotionally-driven power struggle, with each grappling with their complicated relationships to one another and their wider place in the universe. In an appropriate analogy to the franchise itself, Skywalker wrestles with his own understanding of legend and mythos, believing himself unworthy of hero status and wracked with the guilt of failing Ren in his training. Ren, in turn, remains conflicted about his place in the First Order and his murder of his father, whilst Rey feels the growing Force within her yet lacks the knowledge or training to understand it. It's in sequences featuring this core trio that The Last Jedi hits its highest notes. The exploration of Jedi lore, too, receives the kind of treatment that will delight the franchise's most ardent fans, including a moment of outstanding visual flair, involving replicated Reys, that reminds us of Johnson's unique style and character. And, of course, there's Carrie Fisher, whose few scenes remind us how affecting and groundbreaking a character Princess Leia is, and how captivating an actor Fisher was. Her departure is treated with all the deftness, restraint and respect that audiences could hope for. Perhaps the biggest departure from tradition, though, especially in the wake of the gritty spinoff Rogue One, is Johnson's use of comedy. With more gags, one-liners and quirky moments than all the other Star Wars films combined, The Last Jedi introduces a levity to the staid franchise in the vein of Roger Moore's turn as post-Connery Bond. At times it works, even to the point of guffaws, but ultimately the humour feels misplaced. In a story where loss abounds and crushing defeat looms large at every turn, the repeated cutaways to doe-eyed porgs purring like extras from a Pixar film distract more than they entertain. So, too, does Domhnall Gleeson, whose character General Hux plays more like a parody of a Star Wars villain. As a result, both the New Order and the film itself are robbed of their most enduring menace: the Empire. After all, pare back any of the previous films in this sprawling space opera and you'll find that, for all their Sith lords and rogue assassins, what truly terrified was a galactic military-industrial complex so vast and overbearing it was capable of repressing not just people but entire planets. Darth Vaders come and go, and individuals can be destroyed, but totalitarian regimes endure for generations. When an oppressed populace has only ever known a life under the iron fist, it cannot even contemplate an alternative. It's that, more than any great, dark mysticism, that provides the Star Wars universe with its most tangible threat. Overly long and consistently clunky, The Last Jedi ultimately proves a bit of a mixed bag. Its battle scenes are nothing short of spectacular, including a five-second shot involving Laura Dern and a hyperspace jump that almost singlehandedly justifies the entire film's existence. As a chronicle of Jedi mythology, too, the film delivers in a way the George Lucas prequels never managed, offering new and engaging insights into the Force and the balance between light and dark. Too often, though, the dialogue is exposition heavy and played for easy laughs. One senses Rian Johnson has in him a greater, more exploratory story to tell, one unburdened by so much expectation and history. The good news? He's set to follow Last Jedi with an entirely new Star Wars trilogy. May the force be with him."
"Dec 14, 2017",NEGATIVE," There was a comforting sense of deja vu in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which kicked off a new trilogy by mimicking the plot structure of the original film. Don’t worry about falling into a rut, though. The next chapter, The Last Jedi — Episode 8 if you’re scoring along at home (and I know you are) — parallels The Empire Strikes Back incidentally but goes in bold new directions while delivering familiarity. Written and directed with thoughtfulness and visual flair by Rian Johnson (Brick, Looper), it also gives Empire a run for its money as the best Star War. The Last Jedi picks up right where we left off. Rey (Daisy Ridley) has found hermit Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) on a remote island on a remote planet with the intention of bringing him out of retirement to help the Resistance (which a generation earlier was called the Rebellion) take down the First Order (which rose from the ashes of the defeated Galactic Empire). Like most hermits, Luke is grumpy and regretful. He tried to rebuild the Jedi Order a few years ago, but a certain pupil turned to the Dark Side, killed a bunch of people, and made Luke come to the conclusion that the Jedi should just die out. REAL HELPFUL, LUKE. Rey, no slouch in the Force department herself, is psychically connected to Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), the aforementioned misbehaving student who’s now a disciple of the First Order’s Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and would like to be a new Darth Vader when he grows up. There’s some question of whether Kylo Ren still has a spark of good in him — heck, Anakin Skywalker still did at the end of his life, and he’d done worse things. Rey’s origins and potential are also matters of discussion and concern. Meanwhile, Resistance leader Gen. Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) is at odds with her best, cockiest pilot, Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), a hotshot who reminds everyone a bit of the late Han Solo. When Leia is sidelined, Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern) takes charge and has even less patience for “trigger-happy fly-boys” like Poe than Leia did. The First Order, led by the ever-hammy, slowly-losing-it Gen. Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), has tracked the Resistance fleet even through light speed, and it’s only a matter of time before the rebels run out of fuel, their shields come down, and the First Order destroys them. Does Holdo even have a plan? You know who does have a plan? Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), a low-level Resistance crew member who befriends Finn (John Boyega), the reformed Stormtrooper who continues to have doubts about how involved he wants to get with this whole thing. With a tip from owlish space pirate Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong’o), Rose and Finn go looking for a particular expert who can be found in a place known for attracting the worst elements of society, a real hive of scum and villainy, if you will. It’s not a filthy cantina, though — it’s a lavish casino, playground of wealthy war profiteers and other rich villains. There are fine adventures to be had on that planet, including a stampede of space-horses and a reintroduction to the child-slavery theme that made The Phantom Menace such a hoot. (Also: a drunk space-leprechaun putting coins into BB-8, whom he mistakes for a slot machine.) Your old friends Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2 are here, plus a few new characters introduced in The Force Awakens, plus a new species of adorable birds that live on Luke’s hermit island and serve no story purpose but are, as noted, adorable (and presumably delicious). You will also find Benicio del Toro as a mysterious rogue, and several sublime callbacks to previous episodes that deepen the mythology without feeling like wedged-in “fan service.” The conflict still raging inside Kylo Ren is manifested throughout the film in the form of characters and objects being divided: an ugly scar down the middle of someone’s face; someone literally being cut in half; etc. Even the Resistance is briefly split into factions over loyalty concerns, though those problems are worse at the First Order, where Hux and Kylo Ren’s grappling for power shows the weakness inherent in a tyrannical system. Now the thing about Rian Johnson, as you know if you’ve seen any of his other films, is that he’s very good at making films. Brick was set in modern reality but used the language of film noir to color its story. The Brothers Bloom saw the world through a prism of whimsy, misdirection, and con-artistry. Looper was thrilling science-fiction about supernatural forces and history’s tendency to repeat itself. All of these, it turns out, were good practice for the Star Wars franchise, where old cinematic styles, parlor tricks, and lessons about creeping authoritarianism are part of the landscape. True to the formula, Johnson tells his part of the saga by breaking the story into separate threads, each with its own set of objectives, and hopscotching between them. Every location has its action scenes, none of them superfluous, all shot and edited with obvious concern for maximum clarity and impact. Some elements that were computer-generated in previous entries (and looked it) appear authentic here, either because Johnson switched to practical effects or because technology got better (I don’t really care which). Johnson also continues the trend started by J.J. Abrams in The Force Awakens of giving the characters complex emotions and motivations. Humanity was never a strong suit for tech-minded George Lucas, but it abounds in Abrams and Johnson. The Last Jedi has people struggling with personal weaknesses, moral dilemmas, incipient romantic conflicts, and the fear of repeating past mistakes. There’s heroism, fear, remorse, and humility, all intensified by charismatic performances and Johnson’s boundless optimism, which is never bogged down by ponderous speeches. As the rebels’ beloved princess-turned-general has been known to say, the most important thing is hope. We head into the final chapter of the Skywalker saga with plenty of it, both for the fictional heroes and for the story that’s been part of our lives for 40 years."
"Dec 14, 2017",POSITIVE,"Movies should be better than those we could imagine up on our own. Rian Johnson knows what we want to see, and shows it to us in ways we couldn't have envisioned without him."
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE," Even if Star Wars isn’t your religion (as it appears to be with countless people at the early screenings), this is the one holiday movie that’s as inescapable as sales tax—we all know we’re going to see it. It’s hard to say much about Episode VIII of the saga without dishing up spoilers, so suffice it to say that Daisy Ridley still shines as the heroic Rey, John Boyega’s Finn’s heroism still comes tinged with comedy, Oscar Isaac is still insubordinate as Poe, and Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren is still the moodiest, most teary-eyed villain in film history. By now, the franchise is mainly about giving the audience more of what it’s already given it, and the gifted writer-director Rian Johnson (Looper) delivers just that: It runs two and a half hours. Johnson offers more visual invention and better jokes, which is good, more climaxes and drawn-out battle scenes, which isn’t, and more of Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker and the late Carrie Fisher’s Leia, which is touching—both carry an emotional resonance built up over the decades. At one point, Ren says it’s time to let go of the past, and in The Last Jedi, you feel that happening, as its multicultural cast of millennials finally takes over the franchise from the boomer trio who launched it. After years of exploring the craziness of American life—from pornography to Scientology to the oil business—Paul Thomas Anderson travels to ’50s London for this cool, strange, quiet dazzler about the many forms of obsession. In what he calls his final role (hope not), Daniel Day-Lewis stars as Reynolds Woodcock, a painfully refined couturier (he can be driven mad by the sound of somebody buttering toast!) who dresses the rich and titled. When he meets a shy, lovely waitress named Alma (Vicky Krieps), he thinks he’s found the latest in a series of women who serve as muses and are then discarded under the unblinking eye of his protective sister (an indelible Lesley Manville). But their relationship turns out to be far madder than either of them ever imagined. Anderson weaves together a story filled with pathological masculinity, elaborate gowns, sniping aristos, spectacular New Year’s Eve bashes, deadly mushrooms, and shots of driving through the British countryside that are dreamier than any I’ve seen. While some people find the ending too fast to be believable (though less abrupt than in There Will Be Blood), I was wowed by its exquisite, almost Japanese perversity. One of the year’s very best movies, worth seeing more than once. In these days when the media has become everyone’s favorite scapegoat—Trump blames the media for fake news; his opponents blame the media for Trump—Steven Spielberg has made a timely throwback to the days when Americans seemed happy with freedom of the press. Set in 1971, this brisk message movie dramatizes how The Washington Post risked being shuttered for publishing the Pentagon Papers, classified documents illicitly copied by Daniel Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys), which proved that every president since World War II had been lying to the American public about Vietnam. Meryl Streep stars as Post publisher Katharine Graham, an unassertive socialite who normally follows the journalistic lead of her editor Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks, playing it too cute). When the paper gets its hands on the Ellsberg’s mountainous cache of papers, Bradlee wants to publish them—even though this could bring down the malignant wrath of President Richard Nixon, who knew malignancy, and would spook investors, whose money was needed to keep the paper afloat. In truth, most reviews of The Post overpraise it. Most of the newsroom stuff is broad, with too much high-minded speechifying, and the script by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer steers away from anything complicated. Still, whenever we’re following Kay Graham, the movie grows richer and more moving. In a performance of exquisite subtlety and depth, culminating in an extraordinary moment of decision, Streep shows us the inner growth of a woman who, long underestimated (not least by herself), learns how to take charge and assert her values in a world still run by men. Alexander Payne (Election, Sideways) may be our top cinematic satirist, but his latest effort is a hit-and-miss film. It imagines an alternate world in which human beings can be shrunk to a few centimeters tall and dwell in tiny artificial enclaves that, because they’re so small, allow them to live lavishly while using up few of the world’s resources. Matt Damon and Kristen Wiig star as Paul and Audrey, a struggling middle-class couple who decided to get small. But when Audrey pulls out at the last minute, the miniaturized Paul enters this brave new world alone. Soon, he’s involved with his jocular, Eurotrash neighbor (Christoph Waltz), and more decisively, a one-time Vietnamese dissident who now works as a house cleaner. (She’s played by Golden Globe–nominated Hong Chau, who’s excellent in a role that traps her speaking pidgin.) Downsizing’s opening 40 minutes are witty and wonderful, as Payne sets up the premise and cleverly touches on all sorts of current issues: the declining middle class, American consumerism, the marketing of everything. Its detail work is brilliant—the jokes are superbly worked out. But after a while, the movie’s ambition gets in the way. It starts juggling too many big topics—the destruction of the planet, the lives of the underclass, and the need for ordinary white folks like Paul to get woke to the lives of those less fortunate. The movie’s heart is in the right place—it’s about learning compassion—but you’ll wish the preachiness had been downsized, too. If you love Aaron Sorkin, you’re almost certain to love his zippy directorial debut. Based on the memoir by Molly Bloom—played here by Jessica Chastain—it tells the story of how a tough young woman goes from being an Olympic-level skier curtailed by injuries to hosting ultra-high-stakes poker games for Hollywood stars (Michael Cera is fun as a nasty actor), financial geniuses, and—uh, oh!—Russian mobsters. Busted by the FBI, she gets help from an almost prissily honest lawyer, deftly played by Idris Elba, who sees her essential decency. Working in a style that’s quintessentially Sorkin-esque, the movie presents Molly’s journey with wall-to-wall narration, witty banter, and snappy scenes with somewhat pat emotional resolutions. In the past, Sorkin has been accused of sexism for making his heroines brainy women who are emotional basket cases. Not so Molly. Splendidly played by Chastain, who delivers Sorkin’s lickety-split words as if born spouting them, she’s a loner with a soul of finely tempered steel. During her ’40s and ’50s heyday, Gloria Grahame was one of the screen-world’s most alluring and gifted actresses (check her out opposite Humphrey Bogart in the great In a Lonely Place). Her glory days are long past in Paul McGuigan’s movie, which follows Grahame (Annette Bening) in her turbulently passionate romance with Peter Turner (Jamie Bell), a working-class Liverpudlian actor nearly 30 years her junior. Based on Turner’s memoir, their story goes from being merely a curious Hollywood footnote to a surprisingly touching story of unlikely love, unexpected familial relationships (Turner’s family positively adored Gloria), and the many forms of sacrifice. While the script by Matt Greenhalgh doesn’t soar, the performances do. Bell does perhaps his finest work as Turner, who starts off starstruck, grows increasingly ardent, and eventually finds himself getting in over his head. And Bening is, well, sensational, capturing every flutter, flirtatious smile, and haunted twinge of a complicated, flamboyant woman (the real-life Grahame slept with, and later married, her 13-year-old stepson) who seemed to live her whole life on a streetcar named desire. Equal parts potboiler and political drama, Fatih Akin’s topical thriller stars Diane Kruger as Katja Sekerci, as a German woman whose Turkish-born husband and small child are killed in a terrorist explosion. She seeks justice in the courts, but to her horror and fury, Katja discovers that the authorities would prefer to pin it on the victim rather than the obvious culprits, murderous neo-Nazis, to whom the evidence undeniably points. When the film premiered at Cannes in May, I suggested to a critic friend that maybe Akin had stacked the deck in the film’s harsh portrayal of the German justice system’s failure to recognize, let alone confront, the white supremacist fascist threat in the country. She immediately emailed me articles chronicling the actual story on which In the Fade is based—and the reality was at least as heavy-handed as the movie. Now, it must be said that Katja’s story, while gripping, isn’t a lot of fun. But it is compelling, and Kruger, able to work in her native German, gives an extraordinarily deep and passionate performance as a decent, despondent woman who wants justice but may have to settle for vengeance, however strange that revenge may need to be.

"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE," Alarm bells may ring when you realise that the second film in the shiny new Star Wars trilogy is taking its cues, at least in part, from the second film in the original Holy Trinity. The Force Awakens may have been The Star Wars Film We had to Have in order to wash the foul taste of the Prequels out of our collective mouths, but repeating that cheap trick again would be a crashing disappointment – do we really need The Empire Strikes Back 2.0? Luckily, we needn’t have worried. Writer and director Rian Johnson (Looper, Brick) takes familiar figures, archetypes and tropes and pushes them into uncharted territory, examining them, recontextualising them, finding new facets and, occasionally, hidden flaws. The result is a film that simultaneously feels familiar and new – the first “new” Star Wars film since Disney took the reins and clearly, judging by the fact that Johnson will be heading up his own discrete trilogy in the universe soon, the template going forward. And that’s a good thing. But, in the broadest of strokes, The Empire Strikes Back: while nascent Jedi Rey (Daisy Ridley) trains on the distant planet Ahch-To with hermit Jedi Master Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the Reb – sorry, Resistance is on the back foot (a bit of a leap considering the massive military victory that capped off TFA), on the run from Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), wannabe Vader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), and the First Order fleet. From there, things get more complicated: with the First Order able to track the Resistance convoy’s every move, ex-stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) and new hero Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) must undertake a desperate mission to the luxury world of Canto Bight to find an agent who can help them give the bad guys the slip. Meanwhile, hot-headed X-Wing pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) has to contend with Resistance Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern), who has no time for his recklessness, while he thinks her pragmatism is putting the entire Resistance at risk. The Last Jedi delights in setting up and then subverting expectations. This is a Star Wars movie for a more complex age, and while the good guys and bad guys are still clearly demarcated, at a more granular level everything is a bit more blurred. Not every last-ditch desperate gambit works, not every scoundrel has a hidden heart of gold, not every stuffy officer is incompetent and, most importantly, not every aged Jedi is full of wisdom. Indeed, what Johnson does with the Jedi is fascinating – old Luke has sequestered himself in some forgotten corner of the galaxy not to meditate, but to hide from the crushing guilt that he may be responsible for turning promising Jedi Padawan Ben Solo into the evil Kylo Ren. We’re used to reluctant heroes – here we have a reluctant mentor, fearful of training the naturally Force-talented Rey in case he makes the same error twice. Skywalker no longer sees any point in the existence of a Jedi Order at all – it seems Johnson is au fait with those fan theories about the arrogance of the Jedi – and in the context of this film, he may be right. Which is of no use to Rey, who simply wants someone to tell her what her place in the world is, and needs a wise mentor, not an old man filled with doubts. That’s some dark territory, and arguably darker than the simple threat of the fascist First Order: it’s one thing to have the villains put a few runs on the board, it’s quite another to learn that the structures and assumptions on which we base our identities are shaky at best, and perhaps completely unstable. The Last Jedi questions the Light Side/Dark Side binary on which the Star Wars mythos is founded, and while we might wind up more or less where we might expect by the time the credits roll, narratively speaking, it leaves deep cracks in the firmament for later exploration. We get plenty of adventure and action along the way, though. Exotic locales abound, from the aforementioned casino world of Caito Bight, which brings a little 007 flavour to the galaxy (and a missed opportunity for a pitch-perfect cameo, it must be said), to the salt flats of Crait, site of the climactic battle, fulfilling the Star Wars remit of taking us to places we’ve never seen and blowing up spaceships while we’re there. The action sequences are top notch. Everyone likes to call Star Wars a space Western, but Johnson instead digs into the other two key stylistic influences on the trilogy – WWII films and Japanese chambara samurai movies, bookending Episode VIII with a bombing run straight out of Dambusters and a lightsaber duel that wears its Kurosawa debt on its flapping kimono sleeve. All that mayhem is scaled up, too, in a concession to modern blockbuster sensibilities. Why have a Star Destroyer when you can have a Dreadnought? Why odds of a thousand to one when you can have a million? At times it stretches credulity, even for old Star Wars hands, but then this has never been a franchise with much debt to things like physics and probability. But while there’s a lot of fun to be had, a somber pall overlays it all, to the point where some of the comedy beats fall flat in the overall context. This is a movie where the heroes are beaten within an inch of extinction, where the forces arrayed against them are monolithic, where the odds of victory are infinitesimal, and where terrible sacrifices are necessary to leverage those tiny odds. It is, ultimately, a film about hope in the face of overwhelming darkness – and rebellions, as someone once said, are built on hope. Still, it’s only a glimmer of hope in this one – victory by the thinnest of margins, with the highest costs. The Last Jedi is an emotional wringer, and the film never lets us forget the human price that is paid in wartime – we’re perhaps all a bit too savvy than we were 30 years ago to think that casualties are bloodless. When we leave The Last Jedi, we’re in a much different and more difficult place than we were when we started, and while there’s definitely a path forward – of course there’s going to be an Episode IX – what that path might be is up for conjecture. The Last Jedi is, to be clear, a great Star Wars film, one that honours the traditions of the franchise but boldly pushes the envelope in terms of thematic complexity and emotional tone. If this is indicative of the direction the core saga is taking going forward, we’re completely on board."
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE," Only one thing bothered me while watching Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the eighth installment in a series that blazed onto screens in 1977 and 40 years later is, improbably, stronger than ever: why don’t they have transporters? How is it possible that, among all these alien species, not one has invented technology that just “beams” someone (or thing) out of harm’s way? It would save a lot of time. Then again, who needs to save time when you’re having this much fun wondering how a stranded hero will be rescued from an exploding ship? Of course, this isn’t Star Trek, and, perhaps more importantly, the Star Wars saga isn’t set in the future, but “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.” Those familiar opening words are Pavlovian at this point, and they set our inner-child alight, and we settle in for a ride like none other. Oh, and what a ride it is, The Last Jedi (). To be honest, Star Wars has always been less about cold, hard tech and more about the personal. Even the droids, with their assorted bleeps and bloops, seem to have souls. Like so many classic stories, Star Wars explores the relationship between good and evil, but with Last Jedi, the exploration goes further, into the murky, grey areas that lie in between. It’s human conflict on a breathtakingly epic scale. And that’s a point the new film, thrillingly directed by Rian Johnson, makes in full force. J.J. Abrams successfully relaunched the series in 2015 with The Force Awakens by essentially rebooting 1977’s A New Hope, but Johnson, unemcumbered by having to deal with introductions, goes further. The Last Jedi could easily be this current trilogy’s Empire Strikes Back, and while it certainly has the right amount of gravitas to equal what many still consider the best Star Wars of them all, it moves to its own beat, takes new risks, throws in nostalgic essentials, and adheres to a time-tested formula with both rigorous adherence and respect, as well as a deep, genuine, very apparent affection for both the core material and its multitude of fans. The new film is not just magnificent, it’s spectacularly magnificent. It’s easily the best Star Wars since 1980’s Empire, and if it doesn’t quite match that film’s narrative density, it’s certainly not for lack of trying. Johnson has crafted a storyline that pays tribute to the past but also stares headfirst into an uncertain future, taking the story in powerful unexpected directions. The visuals are intense and strong, particularly during the final, dazzling 45 minutes. The score, by John Williams, has never been more potent or meaningful. The action is mind-boggling and masterful, and features a jaw-dropping lightsaber battle that is going to be nearly impossible to top. The new locales are inventive and, at times, rapturous, including a mineral planet that “bleeds” red when its sands are disrupted and is home to a den of crystal pups, which, in addition to being utterly adorable serve a vital purpose. (There are also puffin-like Pogs, but they feel like a merchandising ploy more than anything else.) The movie’s themes are deep and resonant, particularly with regard to the characters of the impulsive, conflicted Kylo Ren (Adam Driver, giving a performance of almost Shakespearean dimensions) and the inquisitive, equally conflicted Rey (Daisy Ridley), whose search for personal meaning has led her to the hut of the legendary Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), currently living a hermit’s life of self-imposed exile. Johnson splits the storyline into three distinct, neatly crosslinked portions. Rey attempts to convince a soured Luke to help the badly decimated Resistance fend off the First Order, which is presided over by the grey-skinned, ghoulish Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). Meanwhile, “hot-shot flyboy” Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac, who has more to do this time around but still comes off a bit stiff) must contend with the consequences of actions taken in the film’s mind-blowing opening sequence, as well as Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern), a purple-coiffed nemesis who has taken command in the absence of Leia (Carrie Fisher) and seems destined make a huge strategic mistake. Finn (John Boyega), meanwhile, emerges from his coma and embarks on a covert mission with a spry mechanic (the delightful Kelly Marie Tran) that takes them to an elaborate alien casino that makes the Cantina on Mos Eisley look like a petting zoo. The storylines are expertly woven together by Johnson — no easy task — and converge in a way that is satisfying, poignant, and thrilling. It’s the kind of conclusion you dream for in an epic — big, bold, and yet grounded and human, with just the right grace notes of humor. Try not to be wrapped in blissful glee watching the film’s final crescendo. I dare you. It’s no spoiler to say that there are things that are, sadly, known. This was Fisher’s last film before unexpectedly passing, but her role is much larger than you’d expect, and she brings an essential heart and warmth to The Last Jedi that is soothing and calming. She’s never been better; future installments will miss her radiance. Similarly, Hamill gives a finely honed, resonant performance and the film is a way to honor both the character of Luke, so vital to the series as a whole, and to the actor himself. Torches, however, have been passed, and Ridley’s Rey is the new centerpiece. “You have no place in this story,” growls someone to Rey, and the assessment couldn’t be more off base. Rey is the lynchpin of The Last Jedi, and her curiosity — and innate compassion — leads her to make a fateful decision that will no doubt inform the ninth installment, due in 2019. “This is not going to end the way you think it will,” Luke, who is adamant that “it’s time for the Jedi to end,” says to Rey. Indeed, it does not. Far be it from me to spoil the ride, other than to say the ride is well beyond amazing. Those few critics who are complaining about The Last Jedi should be exiled to Hoth. The Last Jedi deserves nothing but acclaim, and Johnson, an incredibly adept director who has an instinct for human pathos, deserves to be handed as many future Star Wars films as he can manage. The film is two and a half hours long, making it the longest installment of the series. And yet, you never want it to end. Star Wars is not just ingrained in our culture, it is our culture. It targets our emotions and strikes with a deep, profound, lasting impact. It is our modern day myth — our Iliad, our Odyssey, our contribution to the never-ending stories that keep our lives full and our imaginations forever fueled. It’s a force to be reckoned with.

"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE,Lucas Hit the Jackpot!
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE," If “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” (2015) was a nerdy, beat-for-beat reboot of the original “Star Wars” (1977), “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” is a reboot of “Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back,” (1980), except “The Last Jedi” is longer, of course, and the music, once again by John Williams, is louder. Following that famous pan down from a screen scrawl to a planet’s surface, we see an evacuation of a rebel base, and the First Order, which is not a boy band, closing in. Black-clad, ginger-haired General Hux (Irishman Domhnall Gleeson, dripping with superiority) finds his gigantic First Order cruiser with its accompanying heavily-armed dreadnought being challenged by a Fiat-sized Resistance X-fighter piloted by Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and his rolling robo-buddy, BB-8. This encounter, which involves rebel leader Gen. Leia Organa (a bittersweet turn by the late Carrie Fisher), will set the pattern and tone for this acceptable, if uninspired, installment, officially Episode VIII, written and directed by Rian Johnson (“Looper”). This formula mixes physical and verbal humor in a very dark visual palette, outer space dogfights and chases, some of them gripping, some of them monotonous, the themes of hope and rebelliousness, and talented actors making the most of uneven material. Back on Planet Count of Monte Cristo, Rey (ready for her close-up Daisy Ridley) tries to get Luke Skywalker (a reinvigorated Mark Hamill) to become her Jedi mentor. Meanwhile, gourd-faced Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis, playing a digital character), plays with the mind of Kylo Ren, aka Ben Solo (a very tall Adam Driver), who thinks he wants to be the “heir to Lord Vader,” but maybe not because he has this weird Jedi walkie-talkie mind-thing going on with faraway lonely Rey back on Skywalker’s Chateau d’If-like island hangout, complete with birds that answer the question, “What if Ewoks and Pikachus had children, one of which Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew and Joonass Suotamo), default pilot of the Millennium Falcon, plucks and barbecues?” Is there any chance the “original Jedi texts” Luke keeps in a tree will become available on Abebooks? Will Finn (John Boyega) and savant maintenance worker Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) disable the First Order tracker and elude towering stormtrooper Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie of “Game of Thrones”)? Will Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong’o’s Maz Kanata ever get decent lines or screen time? Snoke’s throne room, where Kylo Ren and Rey are sorely tested, comes complete with a Wicked Witch of the West viewing glass and guards in red vinyl S&M gear. All hail Benicio del Toro’s shifty-eyed master thief. Like the original “Star Wars” and the movie serials it copied, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” recycles a plot that is a countdown to doom being repeatedly delayed, while the heroes and heroines struggle to save the day. Victory is always costly and temporary, because, hey, this is a serial. Is Skywalker the last Jedi? Or will the Jedi Order, to borrow a phrase, “live long and prosper”? Well, it’s certain Disney is going to prosper as long as it is behind the controls of this outer space soap opera. May the cash be with you."
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE," The Resistance is preparing for an epic battle with the First Order. Fledgling Jedi knight Rey (Daisy Ridley) is in training with warrior master Luke Skywalker and is ready to join the battle in “Star Wars: The Last Jedi.” I am not a “Star Wars” fan. I loved, as does anyone with a pulse, the original with its introduction to a galaxy far, far away and its now-classic characters and creatures. It was a space western adventure in its truest form. After that though, to me, it all became repetitive with more of the same, with increasingly bigger budgets, and it all lost its luster, for me. The story, like just about all of the long-running feature series, pits the stalwart resistance against the evil empire in one pitched epic battle after another, mostly recreating on a larger, more bombastic scale those thrilling moments first seen in “Episode IX: A New Hope.” Director-scribe Rian Johnson is best known for his gritty noir film, “Brick (2005),” and sci-fi time travel thriller, “Looper (2012).” He makes the enormous leap to the helm of one of the biggest film franchises ever and the result, while not a thrill form me, will be just that for the legions of “Star Wars” fans around the world. I would not deem it fit for me to describe the story. I just saw the film and the fans, even if they have not yet attended the highly anticipated event, know the story and all of its many threads much better than I. I will say that it does what it is supposed to and pushes forward all of the characters (and some new ones) debuted in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015).” Rian Johnson’s screenplay follows a similar line as the rival franchise “Star Trek: Beyond (2016).” The story re-introduces us to Ray (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) but, this time, they are on separate missions all toward defeating the evil First Order, allowing these characters to further develop their strong-willed, capable abilities (and personalities). The new entries to the cast make their mark on the film and, of course, our old favorites are back – Luke (Mark Hamill), Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo, replacing the venerable original, Peter Mayhew) all take center stage. One nitpick that the fans will not care about: some of the big battle pieces often screamed GREEN SCREEN at me, a flaw that I was surprised to see in a mega-budget special effects extravaganza."
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE,Rian Johnson has made a Star Wars movie that features so many great additions to canon and mythological intrigue that will have fans buzzing for years.
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE,"The perfectly paced new entry to our galaxy far, far away features so many new Star Wars moments to love...a journey full of classic hallmarks and new additions that maintains a balance of lighthearted fun, intense action and deep emotion."
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE,"The Last Jedi is everything a Star Wars film should be, and so much more. Johnson weaves an emotionally rewarding tale while balancing all the essential sci-fi action expected."
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE," Wow. This is the event movie of the year. So much action. So much haunting drama and raw emotion. And it doesn’t just build to one climax. It crescendos up to climax, after climax, after climax… Action/adventure fans will be dancing in the aisles. There is something biblical about Star Wars: The Last Jedi. There’s the Old Testament: Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Chewbacca. The New Testament: Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac).  Devils: Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Temptation. A hunt for the Promised Land. A desperate escape from the wicked. On a desolate, mountainous isle, the young warrior Rey begs the aged Luke Skywalker for guidance and help for The Resistance’s fighters. “We need you. We need the Jedi order back. We need Luke Skywalker,” pleads Rey. She delivers that message from Princess Leia, but the old Jedi is not moved. Meanwhile in outer space, the Resistance is under attack by the First Order and trying to evade them. Finn and Poe go rogue to save the day. Snoke, Hux and Reb are out to crush the rebels. The very heady, ethereal script by writer/director Rian Johnson (Looper) unearths many questions and is stingy with the answers. Your curiosity will drive you crazy. Only when you are stumped and at wit’s end will you find closure. Just know that the wait is worth it. Editing by (Bob Ducsay, Looper) and Johnson’s inventive direction measure the drama, action and rescue attempts out in a rhythm that is almost spiritual. Like the rhythm of life. Help comes when it is preordained. Characters enter, they embark on divergent paths and head out on enthralling missions. Scenes flow smoothly and have a similar feel. Unlike 2015’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens, when energizing action sequences butted up against too many stagnant moments. There are some slower passages, but they are never boring. Use these opportunities to gather your thoughts, digest what you’ve seen and take a deep breath. You will need the rest. Your attention will be overpowered by a force that doesn’t let you decompress substantially for 2 hours and 32 minutes. There are moments when you might think, “This is so overwrought. So melodramatic.” Then a glib line is rendered or a whacky scene (wide-eyed urchins screeching) breaks the spell. You laugh for a moment or smirk. Then you jump back into the conflict again, just as a laser slices a villain in half, as a courageous fighter goes down in flames or as two individuals have an intimate telepathic conversation even though they are eons away from each other. Script, direction, acting are excellent. The imagery is even better. Some visions will be engraved on your pupils forever. Scenes in Snoke’s throne room with blood red walls, warriors in similarly colored uniforms and his gold brocade robe (designed by Michael Kaplan, Blade Runner) are indelible. Rickety old fighter planes sand surfing over white salty terrain leaving a trail of poinsettia red gashes. Galloping alien horse-like creatures. The work by art directors Andrew Bennett and Neal Callow, production designer Rick Heinrichs and cinematographer Steve Yedlin is exquisite. These are the kind of visuals you see in a Yimou Zhang art film (like his Hero or Raise the Red Lantern), not in an action/adventure movie. Ridley, Bodega, Isaac and Driver provide an unbridled energy. Yet it’s the heavyweights, the late Carrie Fisher and gray-haired Mark Hamill, who lend a gravitas that stabilizes this fantasy in an altered reality that’s become the heart of the Star Wars saga. There is a mystical presence that is almost cleansing. That essence has endeared this venerable space opera to audiences for 40 years. For Star Wars novice, this chapter will be a great introduction. It’s easy enough to distinguish the protagonists from the antagonists. Easy to track their storylines. For Star Wars aficionados, this entry is one of the most galvanizing, from beginning to end. What an Odyssey. What a crowd pleaser. WOW!"
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE,What's most thrilling about The Last Jedi is Johnson's seamless blending of old and new Star Wars lore.
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE," Playing out with an alarming degree of familiarity in its tone, setting and storyline, 2015’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens ultimately served franchise course correction over bold storytelling – it existed to reassure the wider audience that Star Wars was in safe hands, and that the (perceived) missteps of the much-maligned prequels would no longer plague fans. With that aim apparently satisfied, The Last Jedi presented an opportunity to push the franchise forward – it’s an opportunity writer/director Rian Johnson (The Brothers Bloom, Looper) has embraced with gusto. This film may not represent a significant upending of what we’ve come to expect from a Star Wars movie, but it nevertheless presents enough new ideas to constitute the most unpredictable and exciting entry in the series since 1980’s widely revered The Empire Strikes Back. Like that film,The Last Jedi upends many of the seemingly permanent notions put forward by its predecessor. It also introduces plot dynamics not seen before in the series – most impressively a protracted military stalemate that forces difficult decisions for the main characters. Only glimpsed in the finalé of the last film, Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker is gifted a narrative that honours the mythic status of the character while allowing for Hamill’s underappreciated dramatic and comedic skills to shine. The late Carrie Fisher’s General Leia Organa has a surfeit of great moments as well, all of which are lent extra poignancy by the actor’s untimely passing. The characters unique to this new trilogy – most notably Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren and Daisy Ridley’s Rey – progress forward in their arcs with a degree of surprise the film’s predecessor may not have led the audience to expect. The opening space battle scene is an all-time franchise highlight, and the film subsequently offers up several dynamic set-pieces that combine dexterous contemporary filmmaking with a clear affection for the possibilities that George Lucas’ creation always promised. The Force is most definitely with Rian Johnson, and The Last Jedi bodes extremely well for the recently-announced trilogy of new Star Wars films that he will write and direct. Also, the origin of Blue Milk is revealed in a scene that feels like something out of early Peter Jackson. The film is peppered with these kinds of joyful moments. Star Wars fans old and new are guaranteed to have an absolute blast."
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE," Spectacular and overwhelming, humorous and sorrowful, despairing and hopeful, smart and silly, unpredictable and familiar, thrilling and languid, direct and convoluted, writer/director Rian Johnson's ambitiously mounted “The Last Jedi” ranks as the third most remarkable “Star Wars” experience after “The Empire Strikes Back” (1980) and “A New Hope” (1977). “The Last Jedi” also emerges as the most operatic episode of the space fantasy series' exploration of the duality of good and evil, enhanced by another pivotal John Williams score. After Walt Disney Pictures purchased Lucasfilm and the “Star Wars” rights in 2012, J.J. Abrams revived the series with “Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens” (2015), a serviceable sequel in which reformed storm trooper Finn (John Boyega) joins the lowly scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley) as she searches for missing Jedi master Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), three decades after the Empire collapsed, only to be replaced by the rise of the fascistic First Order. (Note: Yes, you must see “The Force Awakens” to understand “The Last Jedi.” And you should see George Lucas' original three adventures to fully appreciate the rich visual and verbal references Johnson supplies.) “The Last Jedi” begins not where “The Force Awakens” ends (with Rey meeting Skywalker on the isolated island of Ahch-To), but with one of many slightly disorienting, busy space battles between Rebellion forces, led by General Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher), and the First Order forces, led by the strident General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson). First Order troops, under the ultimate command of the crusty, emaciated Supreme Leader Snoke (reprised by Andy Serkis in a motion-capture performance), have the Rebels on the run and dangerously low on fuel. As Rey tries to understand why the tormented Skywalker would turn away from his Jedi destiny, Finn pairs up with an affable, capable Rebel mechanic, Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), on a mission to recruit a seedy, suspicious codebreaker (a shifty Benicio Del Toro) to shut down a First Order device that can track ships through hyperspace jumps. Adam Driver's Kylo Ren, easily the most complex and conflicted character in the “Star Wars” universe, continues to be split between his own Dark Side impulses and a judicious heart inherited from his father, Han Solo. Series regulars Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), C3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2D2 (Jimmy Vee) make obligatory appearances, but this time out provide nothing essential to the plot. (Chewbacca's comical interplay with adorable puffin-like critters borders on cuteness overkill.) Oscar Isaac's hotshot fighter pilot Poe Dameron clashes with Laura Dern's miscast Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, who sadly lacks the conviction and inspiration she so clearly needs to pull off the character's rousing speech to disenheartened troops. Even so, Johnson's screenplay periodically explodes like a string of narrative M-80s with revelations, reversals, revenge and redemption in a wild walk on the Dark Side, one that shrewdly capitalizes on Hamill's glassy, tear-filled eyes of guilt and regret. “The Last Jedi” suffers from occasional inconsistencies in character and plot, but these quibbles are easily absorbed into the impressively vast and colorful canvas that Johnson paints with such passion and empathy that he will reportedly continue his visit to a galaxy far, far away with his own “Star Wars” trilogy."
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE,"Thankfully The Last Jedi won't be the last Jedi movie, but it should be your next."
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE," The latest instalment in the space saga had to do a lot of heavy lifting to maintain the momentum of the reinvigorated franchise. It not only had to best the enjoyable The Force Awakens, which did come in for some criticism around repetition, it also had to serve as the final piece of Carrie Fisher’s legacy.  Fisher would be proud of Episode VIII, an injection of freshness into a series always only one movie away from staidness — such is the scrutiny of something as loaded as Star Wars.  The Last Jedi launches straight into the action with a propulsive battle scene and it sets the tone for the film — fast-paced, electrifying and well-directed action sequences grounded by sacrifice and loss.  The structure of the movie is taut and cleverly pared back. Unlike The Force Awakens, it doesn’t jerk you from one set-piece to the next, leaving you with whiplash. There is pretty much two parallel storylines that converge neatly.  One picks up where The Force Awakens left off, with Rey (Daisy Ridley) holding out that lightsabre to Luke (Mark Hamill), imploring him to jump back into the fray while desperate to learn from him about her connection to the Force. If she can unravel the mystery of her heritage along the way, then that would be super. The second strand has the remainder of the Resistance — Leia (Fisher), Finn (John Boyega), Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), newbie Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and BB8 among them — on the run from the superior military strength of Supreme Leader Snoke, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and the fascistic First Order.  The clock is ticking with all the action set within the span of about 24 hours which adds a sense of urgency and jeopardy that serves the pacing well. It’s not a perfect movie. The dialogue is sometimes clunky and often unnecessarily expositional, some of the scenes between Rey and Luke go for a minute too long and you’re never sure if characters like the arch General Hux are only there as a figurative punching bag — though Domhnall Gleeson gives very good snivel-face. Ridley is still a little stagey and rigid and Driver swings from wildly manic to the more subtle, interior performances we’ve seen from this talented actor in movies like Jim Jarmusch’s Paterson. But perhaps the erratic-ness is supposed to point to Kylo Ren’s conflicted nature. Boyega is shaping up nicely as a star in the making and Isaac is a force of nature on the screen, a commanding presence you can’t resist while 2017 has confirmed that every movie or TV show is made better with the enchanting Dern. Of course, fans will reserve the deepest love for Star Wars legends Fisher and Hamill. There is an undeniable jolt of excitement every time either is on screen, even if in Fisher’s case it was bittersweet. Just try to contain yourself, we dare you. Johnson was a bold choice as director and writer, having carved out a career with more esoteric, though excellent, movies such as Brick and Looper. It’s clear he is more than able to handle what’s necessary to helm a major blockbuster like The Last Jedi. He’s imbued the movie with a sense of adventure and scale while never neglecting to balance the fun with the emotional significance of any moment.  In the film, hope is the watchword. Everyone is either trying to light the spark or snuff it out, and that’s the real war being fought. The Last Jedi gives us plenty of hope — hope that this 40-year-old franchise will keep fighting strong and telling the stories of heroes and villains, and hope for a better world. After a bruising year, we could all use more of it. The film Civil War is an anxiety-inducing experience from start to finish – but one scene in particular will likely stay with you long after the credits roll. A major film up for five awards at this year’s Oscars has been accused of “line by line” plagiarism in an explosive new report published on the eve of the event."
"Dec 13, 2017",NEUTRAL," We must tread carefully here. Such is the level of hype and anticipation that surrounds this, the eighth proper Star Wars film, that the slightest of “spoilers” could ruin everyone’s Christmas buzz. And I won’t be responsible for ruining anyone’s Christmas buzz. Much is at stake – 2015’s The Force Awakens changed everything. It was, of course, the Star Wars bash that brought the old band back together (Mark Hamill’s Luke, Carrie Fisher’s Leia, Harrison Ford’s Han), whilst simultaneously introducing audiences to a new band of rag-tag space warriors (Daisy Ridley’s Rey, John Boyega’s Finn, Oscar Isaac’s Poe). The Force Awakens was the remastered greatest hits of Star Wars movies, with a few new tracks added on. With JJ Abrams steering the ship, it worked. Rather spectacularly, I might add. It made our Christmas. It grossed more than $2bn (€1.7bn) at the box-office. It also killed off Han Solo. That, right there, is a problem. That, right there, is the thorn in the side of The Last Jedi, a reasonably solid Star Wars flick that is almost worth the hype. Almost. The story is simple – so simple, in fact, that I’m a tad baffled as to how writer and director Rian Johnson (The Brothers Bloom, Looper), managed to get a 152-minute feature out of it. The folks in the First Order (they’re the bad guys) have gone completely bananas. They’re everywhere. They won’t stop until they’ve taken control of and/or destroyed the entire galaxy (their mission statement is unclear, I’m afraid). The lads in charge of spreading the misery are Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), his right-hand men, General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Meanwhile, the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) is getting weaker by the minute. Poor Finn just woke up (he had a heavy first film), while Poe is busy blowing things up. Basically, the Resistance does battle with the First Order, and a lengthy chase through the galaxy ensues. Meanwhile, Rey has gone in search of Luke Skywalker, whom she has found on Skellig Michael (an Irish corner of the planet Ahch-To, in case you were wondering). Everything will, of course, come together for a noisy third act – and there are plenty of sub-plots to keep us busy until then. Plenty of new characters, too (and maybe a couple of old favourites). There will be madness. There might be a lightsaber duel, or two. So how does it all pan out? Rather well, actually. But there are problems. The Last Jedi is the party that never wants to end. It keeps going and going – and going – until there is no corner of the house left to decorate. It pushes all the buttons. It is constantly in competition with itself (it comes with two huge ending sequences). It is also baggy in places, and that’s not something I’d expected. Johnson is a fine writer, and a solid director. The Last Jedi is funny, exciting and pretty spectacular to look at. But it’s no Abrams joint. It lacks the joyful, emotional punch of its predecessor, and the gigantic, Han-Solo-shaped hole doesn’t help (you really do miss the Ford fella). Ridley excels as Rey, a new warrior for a new generation. Boyega continues to have a blast with Finn, and yes, we finally got what we asked for: we finally got more Oscar Isaac (Poe is, like, the best). Hamill is grand as Skywalker, a role that essentially requires him to say cool things and to look intense while saying them. Again, the late, great Carrie Fisher, adds some heavyweight nostalgia as Leia – and that’s fine, but for a film in which one of its most iconic stars makes what is, alas, her final Star Wars appearance, it isn’t nearly as moving as we’d hoped. It isn’t nearly as emotional a Star Wars flick as we’d wanted. It is far, far too long. It sounds as though I’m flip-flopping, right? It’s because I am. It’s because that’s the way The Last Jedi works. One minute, Poe is killing it in an X-wing; the next, Evil Gleeson is hamming it up as General Panto Villain Hux, and we’re wasting time in an alien casino (don’t ask). Yes, Skellig Michael looks terrific, those Porg jokes are adorable, and John Williams’ wondrousscore continues to astound. But the last film was better – simple as. The force is still strong with this one. It just takes the occasional wobble."
"Dec 13, 2017",NEUTRAL," The Last Jedi is a curious mixture of the breathtaking and the banal. It features some of the best scenes in the current Star Wars cycle next to moments that are bombastic and repetitive in the extreme. The film takes itself very seriously one moment and is utterly tongue in cheek the next. All the elements for a great movie are here but they’re not in quite the right balance – and balance as Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) tells Rey (Daisy Ridley), is everything.  One of the main challenges facing director Rian Johnson is that there are so many cards in play. This isn’t just the latest instalment in a long running franchise. Johnson has huge amounts of baggage from the first Star Wars movies to attend to as well as all the plot lines involving the newer characters. This is the last screen performance from the much loved Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia. Fisher had completed her work on the film before her untimely death last December and she features very prominently here. Hamill’s Skywalker is also back at the centre of the story. The film, which lasts for a lengthy 152 minutes, becomes increasingly frustrating in its final stretch. It builds up to a big emotional climax… and then it builds up to another big emotional climax. The main characters face off with light sabres… and then more of the main characters face off with light sabres. Johnson can’t quite work out how to end it all. For all the complexity of the subplots, the storyline is reassuringly familiar. This is again a tale of plucky rebels fighting against enormous odds. They refuse to allow the First Order fascists and their stormtroopers to snuff out the fire of resistance completely. Early on, as the action unfolds to another wonderfully rousing score by John Williams, this is space opera of the very highest order. The special effects are first rate. If you enjoy fire, fury and slow-motion explosions, you’ll find plenty to relish here. Johnson strikes a nice balance between the moments of Kubrick-like shock and awe, in which we see space in its vastness and mystery, and the B-movie elements. The director takes us to many different corners of the galaxy. One of the best parts of the film is that involving Rey’s efforts to prise Luke Skywalker out of retirement. As we discovered in The Force Awakens, Skywalker is living a hermit’s existence on the remote planet of Ahch-To. It may sound like a snooze but this is, in fact, a rainswept promontory very far from anywhere. Skywalker has turned his back on his Jedi past. The scenes on the island resemble something from a futuristic David Attenborough documentary. The place is full of exotic mammals, including sea cow-like creatures which provide Luke with his milk and little fish-faced critters with wheel barrows. Rey (again played with tremendous gumption and charm by Ridley) is the would-be Jedi. Skywalker is her potential guru – but only if she can persuade him to take her under his wing.  While Rey is trying to re-enlist Skywalker in the rebel cause, Leia and her followers are under severe stress in another part of the galaxy. They’re being hunted down by the unctuous and Uriah Heep-like General Hux (an enjoyably smirking and malevolent Domhnall Gleeson). Hux knows that if he bungles his mission, he will have to answer to the evil leader Snoke (Andy Serkis under the usual layers of make-up). Arguably, we see a little bit too much of Snoke. He represents the dark side and is supposed to be evil and mysterious. Bring him out of the shadows, though, and his mystique very quickly diminishes. He becomes just another rubbery faced villain with a funny, amplified voice. When Rey comes face to face with him, it’s a bit like Dorothy meeting the Wizard of Oz. The sense of anti-climax is palpable. There is plenty to enjoy here. Oscar Isaac’s daredevil pilot Poe careers around space with a recklessness that even Han Solo would have admired. The film is full of scene-stealing turns from droids and robots, both old and new. In one memorable interlude, we are whisked off to the galaxy’s sleaziest planet, a sort of Reno in space where high-rollers who’ve become rich through arms dealing like to gamble, drink and party. It’s here we encounter Benicio Del Toro’s character, a stuttering type who seems like a cross between Fagin and the Artful Dodger. The resistance needs him for a daring, last ditch plan to save Leia but as he very openly tells everyone who meets him, he is absolutely not to be trusted. One of the strengths of the film is also one of its weaknesses. Johnson always makes time for character development. This may be a rip-roaring matinee adventure but there are interludes so that Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Rey can commune together across time and space or so that Skywalker can mull over the past and meditate on what being a Jedi really means. The mysticism is quite appealing in its own way but it slows down the narrative. The more earnest moments will always be leavened with slapstick or irony. Hamill plays the ageing Skywalker in engaging fashion, bringing just the right mix of solemnity and self-mocking humour to the role. One of the most likeable characters is Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose Tico, a maintenance worker turned resistance heroine who embarks on a very risky mission with John Boyega’s Finn – and has an excellent comic rapport with him. Laura Dern also registers strongly as Leia’s right-hand woman, the quietly spoken but astute and steely Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo. There are enough characters and subplots here to fill a dozen movies. That ultimately is the problem. For all the skill and enthusiasm with which director Johnson marshals his elements, The Last Jedi becomes increasingly choppy and distracting. Too much is going on and you begin to suspect the story here might be better told in a mini-series than a feature film. As we leap from one character to another, reach a finale and then realise that there are still loose ends to tidy up, the force of the film gradually begins to ebb away. “Bullfighting is not a sport – it is a tragedy,” is the headline from one of the first articles about bullfighting that Ernest Hemingway ever wrote. That is not how the corrida is portrayed in the sprightly and incongruously cheerful new animated feature from the team behind Ice Age and Rio. Director Carlos Saldanha portrays a world in which blood is never spilt. There may be abattoirs for fighting bulls which don’t meet the grade (“chop houses” as they’re called) but there is never death in the afternoon. The film is based on the 1936 book, The Story Of Ferdinand, by Munro Leaf, already made into a short film by Disney in the late 1930s. Its main character is Ferdinand, first encountered as a sweet natured little bullock, more interested in cultivating roses than in fighting. There is no mention whatsoever of his mother but little Ferdinand’s father is taken away early to fight in the corrida. He never returns.  Little Ferdinand makes a daring escape from the bull compound and is taken in by a farmer and his daughter. Here, he befriends a shaggy dog (which looks as if it has just stepped out of a Dulux ad) and lives an idyllic life. He grows bigger and bigger – one reason why the little girl and her father try so hard to keep him out of sight. Bulls are judged on appearances. He looks ferocious in the extreme even if he is a big, herbivorous softie underneath those horns. Some ingenious set-pieces are thrown in along the way. We see Ferdinand wreak havoc at a town flower market, and then, in one of the film’s best scenes, the bull is let loose in a china shop. The filmmakers have an eye for comic details – little old ladies with dusters which make the bull itch disastrously or the annoying bee that stings him in his buttocks, provoking a volcanic response, or the surreal moment in which a caterpillar disappears up his nostrils; by the time he sneezes it out, it has turned into a butterfly. We know exactly what the fates have in store for Ferdinand. He is bound to end up in the bullfight arena sooner or later, face to face with the conceited matador (“El Primero”). In theory, one or other of them has to die. In practice, we know that is not going to happen. In spite of its evasions, this is still a film of considerable charm. The voice work helps immeasurably. David Tennant gurns and mutters away in entertaining fashion as the fiery Scottish bull, Angus, who can’t see through the hair on his forehead and therefore thinks he is blind. Whenever he tries to confide in anyone, he ends up speaking to their backside. There are three scene-stealing hedgehogs called Uno, Dos and Quatro (they don’t like to talk about what happened to Tres) who befriend Ferdinand in his hour of need, and three snorting, whinnying, conceited Austrian horses, Klaus, Greta and Hans, who mock him relentlessly from the other side of the electric fence. Bobby Cannavale gives the film its testosterone injection with his vigorous voice work as Ferdinand’s would-be nemesis, Valiente, a bull who loves to fight. The evocation of Spain is on the half-hearted side. We hear castanets on the soundtrack, one or two characters speak with Spanish accents and there are the inevitable “ole’s!” when the bullfighting begins in earnest. There is no sense, though, of what period in which the film is set. Is this the Franco era or the modern day? It is hard to tell. If you are not an American Football fan, some of the in-jokes may leave you baffled. Former star quarterback Peyton Manning voices the good-looking, narcissistic “Guapo”, a bull who is predictably wayward in his aim. There is some sort of message here about tolerance, courage and inclusion but Ferdinand is stuck on the fence when it comes to that tricky question about whether bullfighting is sport or blood-soaked barbarism. We are encouraged not to think too hard about what the matador really does with his sword and to enjoy the good natured high jinks the film provides instead. Brazilian Oscar contender Bingo: The King Of The Mornings is an uneven affair. At its best, it has a transgressive energy reminiscent of Martin Scorsese’s The King Of Comedy. Its main character is the type of charismatic delinquent you could imagine a young Robert De Niro playing.  Augusto Mendes (Vladimir Brichta) is a small-time actor in Rio in the 1980s, dreaming of making it big. He appears in soft porn films to pay the bills and is devoted both to his young son and to his mother, an ageing diva who was once a big name in Brazilian theatre. Augusto is very resentful of the bosses at the big Brazilian TV stations who haven’t spotted his talents. Augusto’s big break comes in unlikely fashion when he wins the role of the lead clown in a kids’ TV show. The American producer gives him the role because he makes the crew laugh, little realising that Augusto’s routine was a foul-mouthed tirade in Portuguese against him. As played by Brichta, Augusto is anarchic, impulsive, shameless, and very flamboyant He takes the business of being a clown very seriously, studying under a veteran circus performer. Augusto looks every bit as threatening as Pennywise in Stephen King adaptation It, but his grotesquerie is part of his appeal. Fuelled by drugs and alcohol, he has a recklessness which appeals to the kids, who are bored of safe, mainstream TV. He involves the young viewers in his shows, inviting them to call in and encouraging the studio audience to participate too. As the success of the show increases, Augusto becomes increasingly frustrated. No one knows his real identity. The producers insist he keeps it secret. When he takes off his make-up, he sinks into humiliating anonymity. Augusto is also so self-obsessed that his relationship with his son frays to breaking point. He is too busy working, womanising and partying to remember the boy’s birthday or even when to pick him up after school. In his debut feature, director Daniel Rezende (a renowned editor) foregrounds the sheer chutzpah and energy of his protagonist but the latter part of the film is far less invigorating than the beginning. There is a grim inevitability about Augusto’s slip into booze-filled self-pity. He lusts after his uptight, strictly religious producer, Lucia (Leandra Leal), and takes a bet with the cameraman that he will soon be able to seduce her. Instead, he falls prey to her goodness and Christian zeal. The film is based on the true story of Arlindo Barreto, who played Bozo on Brazilian TV, really did become a drug addict and found solace and redemption through the Baptist church. Augusto is a far more appealing character when he is behaving badly than when he is trying to do the right thing. Vladimir Brichta plays him with tremendous verve, capturing the character’s recklessness, his ambition, his humour, his naivety and his cheerful sleaziness. His performance holds together a film that otherwise would have risked turning smug and sanctimonious. “I don’t get this guy,” a probation officer says of released convict Jacob Harlon (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) late on in brutal crime drama Shot Caller. You can understand his confusion. Jacob was a stockbroker from Pasadena living a “blessed” life with wife (Lake Bell), loveable kid, and all the middle-class trimmings. Then he was responsible for a car accident in which his best friend was killed. He was sent to prison on a manslaughter charge – and, in no time at all, underwent an extraordinary metamorphosis. The bourgeois businessman was transformed into a bearded, tattooed, testosterone-driven, muscle bound, white supremacist gang member with a streak of absolute ruthlessness about him. “Once a dude gets institutionalised, anything is possible,” one character observed of the startling way that inmates’ personalities are liable to change inside Californian clinks.  On many levels, Shot Caller makes no sense whatsoever. It beggars belief that Jacob would take so many decisions so damaging to his family. The film explains that different rules apply within the prison system. Even so, his behaviour is unfathomable.  New prisoners have two choices: either to become victims or predators. Jacob, the politely spoken businessman, gets in touch very quickly with his inner warrior. In no time at all, he is brawling, stabbing stool pigeons and taking part in race riots. He also does his fair share of the menial tasks, hiding smuggled drugs up his backside and conveying messages among the gang members. As an exposé of a broken penal system, the film is thoroughly unconvincing. As a thriller, it is on the clumsy side. As a story about an Edward Bunker-like ex-con not going straight, it’s pretty patchy too. Some of the dialogue sounds as if it was warmed up from creaky old TV cop shows. Shot Caller is, though, an excellent opportunity for its star Coster-Waldau (who also experienced long-term imprisonment in Game Of Thrones) to show his prowess as a full-blown method actor. He is equally credible both as the stockbroker and as the hardened thug Jacob becomes. He shows viciousness, cunning and appears to relish the camaraderie of his new existence alongside his low-life friends. Jacob warns his disbelieving wife that she needs to wash away the “stink” of him from her life.  Director Waugh knows how to stage a brawl or a close-quarter stabbing. Where he struggles is in constructing a coherent plot. “A warrior’s deadliest weapon is his mind,” we are told at one stage. If that is the case, it’s a weapon that Jacob has no idea how best to use. Jia Zhangke’s Mountains May Depart might best be described as an intimate epic. It combines family melodrama with a probing analysis of changing times in contemporary China. The film unfolds over three decades, opening in 1999, taking us to 2014, and then onto 2025.  In the first section, dance instructor Tao (played by the director’s partner and regular collaborator Zhao Tao) is a seemingly carefree young woman. She lives in a fast-changing provincial town. Two men are wooing her. One, her childhood friend Liangzi (Jing Dong Liang), is a worker at the local mining company. He’s the decent and reliable type. Her other suitor is the impatient and ambitious Zhang (Zhang Yi), part of a new breed of entrepreneurial businessmen. It is startling how quickly Jia raises the stakes. This isn’t just a story of young love but of radically different philosophies. Liangzi stands for the old collective vision. Zhang is a symbol of a brash new China in which the individual has the chance to flourish. He is also far more ruthless in his courtship than his rival. Mountains May Depart isn’t as openly bleak in its depiction of contemporary China as Jia’s 2013 feature, A Touch Of Sin, but it does reveal how suddenly individuals can be uprooted and their lives transformed. There is no security for anyone. The relatively idyllic life that the three protagonists enjoy in the opening chapter doesn’t last for long. In the second episode, set in 2014, Tao is living in the big city and confronted by the anxieties and disappointments that come with middle age. Her marriage has broken up, her father is old and close to death. She has a child but her husband is now living with another woman. She barely gets to see her son, Dollar, and is very aware that she is “of no use to him”. Tao is past 40 and has little chance of finding another husband. The world is already passing her by. In the intervening years, the entire country has changed. Material wealth has increased hugely, at least in the big city (if not in the remote backwater where Liangzi is now living). New opportunities are opening up but many of the old bonds that kept society together have frayed. The third section deals with the experiences of Dollar (Dong Zijian) as a young student living in Australia, where his father has gone to build a new life. It’s 2025. Dollar has completely lost touch with his mother. He has an affair with a foreign language teacher (Sylvia Chang), herself uprooted from her original background. The teacher helps him to confront his past and to remember his mother.  This final section may be set in the future but Jia doesn’t resort to sci-fi cliches. 2025 seems little different from the present day. The director’s interest is less in how the technology has changed than in what has happened to his protagonists over the quarter of a century the film covers. The Australian scenes are mannered and a little maudlin. Jia isn’t above using soap opera like plot conventions but even at its most manipulative and emotional, the film never loses its focus on the bigger picture. This is a film not just about upheavals in Tao’s life but about convulsive changes in the society around her too."
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE," The story: Picking up from A Force Awakens (2015), the characters are on separate missions. Rey (Daisy Ridley) finds Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and hopes that he will join the Resistance, led by General Leia (Carrie Fisher). Finn (John Boyega), the former stormtrooper, tries to find a way out of an imperial blockade, aided by engineer Rose (Kelly Marie Tran). Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), servant of Supreme Leader Snoke (voiced by Andy Serkis), is still a follower of the Dark Side of the Force. There is every chance that this movie will beat all others at the box office this year. There is that brand name, of course, but in this episode of the long-running space opera, there is also huge entertainment value. The movie opens with a giant space battle, and except for a saggy middle section set in the island where Luke Skywalker (Hamill) lives, the action never lets up. Writer-director Rian Johnson's story treats the cast as an ensemble - no single story dominates in this mission-driven piece. Each member of the Resistance has a job to do on a different planet. Finn and Rose (Boyega and Tran), for example, have to pull a heist on a resort planet. Rey (Ridley) and Skywalker (Hamill) have a Shaw Brothers gongfu set-up in which she is the Jackie Chan student and Skywalker the crusty old master. Meanwhile, pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Resistance leader Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) have a loose cannon-versus-uptight boss dynamic of the sort you might find in a cop movie. Doing a slavish copy of a Shaw or shouty politics film could have made for a terribly cliched and by-the-numbers experience, but Johnson's love and respect for genre works is clear in how he makes each story feel fresh. Big space battles are one thing, but there are smaller action setpieces here that can only be described as beautiful. In one light-saber duel, First Order guards in bright-red robes do battle with the Resistance in a dark chamber. The choreography of colour and movement would not be out of place in a samurai movie by Akira Kurosawa or a Zhang Yimou period piece; the effect is breathtaking. There are a couple of weaknesses, the Rey-Skywalker thread being one. Johnson's affinity for the New Age-y tone of Jedi spiritualism is apparently not as deep as his affection for other kinds of films, but it's all saved by snappy editing. ""Meanwhile, over at planet X"" could be this film's motto. A day-after review like this one gives one time to reflect on plot holes and other weaknesses. And yes, there are narrative gaps you could drive a lorry through, perhaps because of concessions to the already lengthy 2 1/2-hour running time."
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE," With $2.2 billion dollars in the bank and 2 years of eager anticipation behind it, The Force Awakens laid down a hefty benchmark for The Last Jedi to match up to. Rian Johnson’s directorial Star Wars debut comes at a crucial time for the future development of the franchise. Get it wrong and it’s potentially a cycle of diminishing returns. Get it right – with Galaxy’s Edge, the live action and animated shows and much more besides at stake – and the skies the limit. Luckily, Rian Johnson manages to just about pull it off. We rejoin the story not at the expected moment of Rey handing Anakin Skywalkers lightsaber back to Luke Skywalker after years of self-imposed solitude but as the Resistance fleet, battered by the destruction of the Republic, flees D’Qar and heads for the skies with the First Order in hot pursuit. This chase – distinctly reminiscent of the long voyage of the Battlestar Galactica – forms the spine of the story that other elements weave around. A healed Finn (John Boyega) and Rose (newcomer Kelly Marie Tran) strike out to buy the fleet a chance, heading for the casino world of Canto Bight in search of a hacker who can help them stop the First Order from tracking them while Leia, Poe and Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern) try to buy time. Meanwhile, Rey is confronted not by the eager master Jedi she expected, but by a tired, beaten Luke Skywalker who wants no part of any of this, and this is the part of the film where new lore is laid, and the lines between darkness and light are distinctly blurred. It’s a brave director who challenges the status quo of the saga, but Johnson rocks all over the world of Star Wars and gives us much to think about. No doubt about it, this is a film you need to see multiple times to catch the nuance and drama on display. Dramatic to the point of distraction, flippant and quirky, sometimes to its disadvantage, loaded with cameos of varying effectiveness and another great John Williams score, The Last Jedi is impressive filmmaking with first-class performances from Fisher, Hamill and Adam Driver. Back over to you J.J.."

"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE,"Bottom line: ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" may not be the best installment in the now 40-year-old franchise, but it packs enough action and surprises to keep fans happy through the Christmas season and beyond."
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE,[Daisy] Ridley already proved herself a worthy addition to the Star Wars fold and does nothing here to convince us that we weren't right to welcome her for what evidently will be a long run.
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE," Fans who felt that “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” played it safe or skewed too close to the original Star Wars films will find much to like about “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” – if they go into it with an open mind and willingness to step into uncharted terrain. There’s a moment in the trailer (and also the final film) in which Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) exclaims ‘This is not going to go the way you think’. The line isn’t just a dire warning to a key character, it’s a mission statement from writer-director Rian Johnson (“Looper,” “Breaking Bad”), who makes a few well-chosen references and callbacks to previous entries, but focuses mainly on moving both the story and the universe it inhabits forward and away from safe, familiar territory. The film is the first in the series to pick up immediately after the events of its predecessor: The Resistance has dealt a vicious blow to the First Order, who arrives on their doorstep looking for payback. Reduced to a handful of ships and a few hundred dedicated fighters, our heroes make a run for it under the leadership of General Leia Organa.  Played by the late Carrie Fisher, she gets lots of screen time and owns every minute of it, making her untimely passing all the more heartbreaking.  Alongside her is her associate, the ambiguous Admiral Holdo played by Laura Dern in an inspired bit of casting against type. Their enemies, led by pasty-faced ladder-climbing bureaucrat General Hux (Domnhall Gleeson) and Vader-obsessed bad seed Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) are relentless in their pursuit, leading reluctant hero Finn (John Boyega) and brash pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) to go rogue in parallel attempts to save what’s left of the Resistance. Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley) has tracked down Jedi master Skywalker and urges him to leave his self-imposed exile and take up the fight. Luke is a shadow of what he once was, and a broken man haunted by regret for reasons that will be left unspoiled here. George Lucas built his saga around the concepts of the mono-myth and the hero’s journey; Johnson implodes that structure by giving us a hero made aware that happy endings don’t last and that becoming a legend isn’t all that it’s cracked up to be. In fact, Johnson his players debate the perceived importance of legacy and preoccupation with the past. It’s a much-needed bit of self-reflection for an ongoing series that’s spanned 40 years, several feature films, and a metric ton of spin-off material. It’s not only “The Empire Strikes Back” of the sequel trilogy, but also of the whole damn franchise to date. Much like that 1980 installment, there’s a sense that anything can happen going forward, especially now that the new generation of heroes and villains is planted firmly in the foreground. Dameron gets some much-needed development, and his hot-headed bravado makes for a nice contrast to the callow youth of his co-stars.  It is no surprise that Disney has tapped Johnson to draft a new trilogy for (read: the future of) the franchise, whose future has been in doubt given the recent spate of terminated directors. The series feels like it is truly moving forward for the first time in decades, and that future now looks more promising."
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE," With a new ""Star Wars"" movie hitting the big screen every year now, the galaxy doesn't seem as far, far away as it once did. It's possible the franchise's ubiquitousness in recent years is working against ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"" which picks up where J.J. Abrams' ""The Force Awakens"" left off in 2015. Or maybe it's just a case of ""The Last Jedi"" itself overstaying its welcome with a running time topping two and a half hours. Written and directed by Rian Johnson (""Looper""), ""The Last Jedi"" isn't a bad film by any means. It's full of moments both thrilling and poignant, with anticipated reunions and goodbyes, and pulse-pounding action. The plot borrows from both ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi,"" then moves off in different directions as opposed to following either one beat by beat, as ""The Force Awakens"" did ""A New Hope."" But Johnson makes the unfortunate decision to keep the three young heroes whose energy and chemistry gave ""The Force Awakens"" much of its spark — hotshot pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), stormtrooper-turned-resistance-fighter Finn (John Boyega) and scavenger-turned-Jedi-in-waiting Rey (Daisy Ridley) — separated for much of ""The Last Jedi."" The second act drags as it follows their individual story threads. A detour to a casino planet where Finn and a resistance mechanic named Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) search for a codebreaker to help them disrupt the First Order's tracking of the retreating resistance ships feels like a trip into another movie. The stakes here seem far lower than the live-or-die scenario facing Poe, General Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher) and the others trying to make their getaway. As in ""The Force Awakens,"" the most dramatically rich material comes in the story of Rey, which is bound also to Jedi hermit Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and his nephew, the Dark Side-rich Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), aka Ben Solo. Rey's mission in seeking Luke out at his hideaway at the ancient, original Jedi temple is twofold — bring him into the resistance and learn from him about the power she feels growing within herself. The grizzled, haunted Luke we see here bears almost no resemblance to the hopeful hero of the original trilogy, and Hamill gives the performance of his life as we learn what broke him so. It is, of course, tied to Kylo Ren, and the connection Rey shares with him is stronger than she realized, as he seeks to seduce her to the dark and she tries to lead him to the light she insists is still inside him. Shedding the mask he wore as a twisted homage to his grandfather, Darth Vader, Kylo Ren is fixed on becoming his own man. The question is whether that man is a follower of darkness or light. As their story plays out in unexpected ways, Rey, Luke and Kylo Ren form the foundation of ""The Last Jedi,"" and the movie becomes less interesting whenever it strays from them for too long. Luckily, it recovers in its superb third act, the various characters and plot lines coming together as our heroes make a desperate final stand, holding on to hope even when all seems lost. Johnson answers most of the questions raised by ""The Force Awakens,"" and with the ending not quite a cliffhanger, it's hard to say where the story will go in the trilogy-concluding Episode IX (coming in 2019). That's a good thing, because for a franchise to sustain itself when it's saturating the market the way ""Star Wars"" will do for the foreseeable future, it needs to keep the audience guessing with unpredictable twists and turns.

"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE,"While The Last Jedi acknowledges the inevitable comparisons to [The Empire Strikes Back] by setting up some similar scenarios, it then does original and surprising things with those moments."
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE,"Entertains as comfort food in filmic form, but this is an altogether slighter experience than the spectacular one ""The Force Awakens"" provided. This is a fine film in spite of its many issues, easily recommendable to fans."
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE," If you didn’t already have the incentive to see “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” the return of Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker, as well as Carrie Fisher’s final performance as Leia, are more than enough of an enticement. But beware. Your overall enjoyment depends on your level of fandom, along with a tolerance for plot contrivances, unanswered questions and thin character development. That’s not to say this eighth installment in George Lucas’ epic sci-fi saga doesn’t have its pleasures. It does. In fact, the last act overcomes a sluggish middle and is as thrilling as this franchise ever gets. But once those final credits roll, it’s hard not to feel let down. Why? Well I can’t really get into all that without spoiling the twists and surprises Lucasfilm is heavily guarding. This is a “Star Wars” for a new generation, and for those of us old enough to have seen the original trilogy in theaters, it’s like one big Jedi mind trick. We’ve seen this story before. Sure, “stuff” happens over the film’s 157 minutes but our main characters remain pretty much in the same place. You’d swear time stands still. “The Force Awakens” got by on nostalgia. This one needs to offer more than cute droids and epic explosions. As indicated in the signature opening scrawl, “The Last Jedi” picks up where “The Force Awakens” ended – with the evil First Order threatening the Resistance. Writer-director Rian Johnson (“Looper”) takes the keys to the “Galaxy” from J.J. Abrams and it’s a seamless transition. Johnson sticks to the Star Wars playbook, chronicling another chapter in the seemingly endless 40-year-old civil war between the Resistance and the First Order. Like always, the good guys are down, but not out. Gen. Leia Organa (Fisher, who died after filming wrapped) sends Rey (Daisy Ridley, superb) on a mission to coax Jedi master Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) out of exile to help save the galaxy and restore confidence. It’s a recycled plot string straight out of 1977’s Episode IV. Think: “Save us, Obi-Wan. You’re our only hope.” Meanwhile, the First Order threatens, per usual. And why have one villain when you can have a trio of dark-side baddies, each lusting after power? Reprising their parts are Adam Driver as the father-murdering Kylo Ren; Domhnall Gleeson as the exasperated General Hux and Andy Serkis, as the mysterious Supreme Leader Snoke. Johnson crosscuts the interesting story developing between Skywalker and Rey – he’s showing her the Jedi way — with the Dark Side doings and a secondary mission involving Finn (John Boyega) and new character Rose (Kelly Marie Tan, terrific), an ace mechanic for the Resistance who might just become your favorite character. Handsome flyboy Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Leia run things from the Resistance side of the table. Johnson flat out wastes franchise newcomers Benicio Del Toro and Laura Dern. Johnson’s script is ambitious. There’s a lot of information and exposition to process. There are some revelations, an obvious twist involving Kylo Ren (aka Ben Solo) but the one central to Johnson’s story — Rey’s lineage — is not revealed. But you don’t really love “Star Wars” for the narrative. That’s like saying you get Playboy for the articles. No, you go for the spectacle, to be visually stunned and whisked away on an adventure to a galaxy far far away to see exotic creatures (Porgs!) and witness magnificent lightsaber duels, to fly in hyperdrive with those white streaks swooshing on the screen, to blow stuff up and to hear John Williams glorious score. A five-time Oscar-winner, Williams’ compositions enliven the whole enterprise. In the 2015 “Force Awakens,” Abrams set the stage for this next generation of “Star Wars,” and it is Johnson’s job to move the story forward. He needs to do more than infuse the script with spots of broad comedy and near-miss deaths. “Star Wars,” at least as most of us know it, is gone. Han Solo is dead, Skywalker is vastly different, and Fisher’s death last year raises questions about Leia’s storyline. Rey and Finn are supposed to carry the franchise into the future but it’s hard to imagine where the story goes next. Cast: Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Adam Driver, Domhnall Gleeson, Laura Dern, Andy Serkis, Benecio Del Toro and Kelly Marie Tan."
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE,"The Last Jedi delivers the all-too-rare thrill of a huge popcorn movie that respects the intelligence of its audience, while also serving up plenty of moments designed to make them lose their damn minds."
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE,"It's a compelling feature for the most part, but it's too obsessed with surprises, often sacrificing stability just to rattle fans."
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE," I liked ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi."" I did not love ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi."" Please read those sentences very closely because I fear that we live in a time where when you just ""like"" something that is this heavily anticipated, it means the movie is somehow awful or a massive let down. I don't know when we got to a point where ""liking"" something means that it's ultimately negative. Monday evening, I was a having a discussion about this very subject with one of my best friends. We both felt this strange idea that any type of negativity we displayed about this film, as ""Star Wars"" fans, would lead people to believe that we somehow hated the film. That couldn't be further from the truth. As a massive fan of ""The Force Awakens,"" ""The Last Jedi"" entertained and geeked me out enough to recommend the film but unfortunately, I walked away ultimately feeling underwhelmed with a minimal desire to see more of this story continue in Episode 9. I just felt the film had pacing issues and unnecessary comedic arcs that affected the film's overall tone. A review like this is very tough to write because there's so much I liked about the film, but there's also much I disliked. As I'm sure you can already tell, I'm conflicted about my feelings and still processing what I saw. I am going revisit the film for a second viewing and I'll add an update to this review after that viewing. When the film works, ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" can be an incredibly fun, gorgeously photographed, well-acted crowd-pleaser. There are moments in Johnson's film that rank among some of the best in the ""Star Wars"" franchise. You will know and feel these moments when you see them. I saw the film with a sold-out crowd where people, including myself, were cheering like little kids. It was an incredible atmosphere to be in and there were moments of pure geeky bliss. When these moments happen, the film is firing on all cylinders and it puts you in a mindset that you're watching one of the best ""Star Wars"" films. Though, it's the moments surrounding these scenes that present the overall conflicted and underwhelming feeling I have as I type these words. They created a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde reaction from me as I would go back and forth disliking aspects of the film to loving elements of the film. This shift from mediocre to awesome reminded me of how I felt watching Gareth Edwards' ""Rogue One."" The Darth Vader sequence in that film is one of the greatest scenes in the history of ""Star Wars,"" but it doesn't make up for the problems I had with the overall film; i.e. forgettable characters and storyline. Yet, since it ends with that Vader moment, you leave the theater on such a high that it's hard to think back on what you saw previously. ""The Last Jedi"" has moments on that level that I worry will serve to protect the film's overall problems. Shifting to ""The Last Jedi,"" let's start with the positives. Johnson has definitely crafted a different type of ""Star Wars"" film that takes risks with tone and storytelling. That is a great element to have and it's beautiful that we can hear Johnson's voice among this massive franchise. You can feel Johnson's passion running through the veins of this film as he adds his signature to one of the greatest franchises in the history of cinema. There are shots in this film that are among the most beautiful in the franchise; specifically, the way Johnson uses the color red. As you've seen in the trailers, red is a leading character in the film and there's no shortage of it. There's no question that Johnson is one of the best directors working today as displayed by his work with ""Brick"" and ""Looper."" Johnson is a filmmaker who also believes in shooting on film and that magical grainy quality of 35 mm film comes brilliantly across in ""The Last Jedi."" The action sequences are incredible and what serve to be the best moments of the film. Johnson seamlessly mixes practical effects with CGI to a point where it all just feels very grounded and realistic. We all know that films today have become absurdly CGI-heavy because filmmakers rely entirely too much on computer-generated effects. The key to CGI, as we saw with Steven Spielberg's ""Jurassic Park,"" is to do everything you can practically and then use CGI to fill in the elements that are impossible to pull off on-camera. CGI should just be a tool that you can use if you have to. With ""The Last Jedi,"" you can feel the film's reality in the massive landscapes, the practical ships and creature effects. There's just something amazing about looking at these creatures and knowing they are really there on-set being operated by someone off camera. The technology behind BB-8 still blows my mind and you'd be surprised to know how much of BB-8 is practically done on-set. There are just so many opportunities where Johnson could have used CGI, but you can tell where he and Abrams, on ""The Force Awakens,"" went the extra mile to keep things as practical as possible. Obviously, I won't go into the story details, but I do want to talk about the introduction of two new characters that I enjoyed. Let's start with Kelly Marie Tran's character: Rose. I loved this character, her arc and what she stood for. Tran is a bright and shining star in Johnson's film and one of the few characters I'm very excited about learning more about as the franchise continues. Another character that I loved was Laura Dern's Vice: Admiral Holdo. Unfortunately, I can't say why I love her character but I will say that she is responsible for one of my favorite moments in Johnson's film. Continuing with the positive, John Williams score is masterful. I absolutely love the continuation of his classic themes with the addition of the new themes from ""The Force Awakens"" and now ""The Last Jedi."" The more and more I hear his themes for Rey and Kylo Ren, the more I fall in love with them. When I first saw ""The Force Awakens,"" I wasn't blown away by his new music, but it's grown on me and it fits beautifully into the franchise. Performance-wise, Andy Serkis is brilliant as Supreme Leader Snoke and is featured in my favorite scene of the entire film. There is a scene with him that will blow your mind and have you jumping out of your seat. The performance-capture technology on this character looks incredible and the part contains masterful voice work from Serkis. Serkis has mastered the technology of performance-capture as his work brilliantly comes through the CGI-version of the character. You have to understand that Serkis is acting like every other actor in the film. As with his Oscar-worthy performance in ""War for the Planet of the Apes,"" he performs the character on-set and then the performance is translated digitally to the character of Snoke we see on-screen. As with ""The Force Awakens,"" Adam Driver's performance as Kylo Ren is brilliant. To me, he's the most interesting character because of his conflict with the light and the dark side. In ""The Last Jedi,"" we explore that conflict much more and I thought he played it so well. Driver has a unique ability to capture the audience with his internal conflict. He wears it all on his face. That conflict blended with Rey's character end up being the most interesting elements of the film. Daisy Ridley is fantastic as Rey and her scenes involving Driver are something I wanted more of in the film. There was so much to explore there, emotionally and I felt that Johnson tapped into that but didn't go far enough with it. Carrie Fisher's performance is much better and much fuller in ""The Last Jedi."" Fisher has more screen time and serves as more of an emotional core to this particular story. I felt Johnson handled General Leia much better than Abrams in ""The Force Awakens."" On to the negatives and I will be very vague/spoiler-free here. Let's start with the first act of the film. The first act of the film features major pacing issues combined with unnecessary comedic moments that ultimately hurt the tone of the film. Unfortunately, a lot of this comes from Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker character. Obviously, I can't say anything specific, but I don't like the direction Johnson took Luke's character in this film. Luke is unnecessarily grumpy and comedic to a point where it just turned me off from the character in the first act. In fact, it got a point where I just became bored with the character. It's tough to say exactly what I mean, but I just wanted so much more from the moment when Luke and Rey first meet. As you saw at the end of ""The Force Awakens,"" Rey finds Luke where she hands him his lightsaber. Abrams ended ""The Force Awakens"" on that moment and the big question is what will happen next. To me, what happens next was very underwhelming. I don't fully understand why it was taken in that direction but you will see what I mean when you see the film. Again, it's very hard to discuss what I didn't love about the film without giving away spoilers. In keeping with the vague tone, I just didn't leave the theater wanting another episode. At the end of ""The Force Awakens,"" I was blown away and couldn't wait to find out what happens next. I was so upset that I had to wait two years to find out what would happen next. When I left the theater after ""The Last Jedi,"" I didn't have any need or want for another episode. I felt this film brought enough closure to certain elements that I didn't find myself wanting more. I wanted to love this film. I really did. I just liked it and that's OK. I'd give it 3.5 out of 5 stars. It doesn't reach the level of ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""A New Hope,"" ""The Force Awakens, ""The Return of the Jedi"" or even ""Rogue One."" In fact, I'd probably put it on the same level as ""Rogue One."""
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE," Is it bad that I may have outgrown the Star Wars universe? “The Last Jedi” hits all the notes. But I found myself frustrated that the tone was comedy and sometimes almost veered into parody. In “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” Rey (Daisy Ridley) joins Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) on an island on some far off and hidden planet in hopes of being taught to be a Jedi. Of course, Luke is having none of it. His dark path has led him to reject the Force, although his present tiny, isolated residence sits at some kind of powerful cross-section, a nexus that perplexes him. For sure, this Skywalker is a divided and tortured soul but recognizes that his power imbues him with great responsibly. It’s the classic theme. Meanwhile, the conflicted Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), fresh off killing his universally beloved father Han Solo, attempts to prove himself to Supreme Leader Snoke (a CGI Andy Serkis). Snoke is a hideous ruler who is thankfully a more concrete creation here and not some gigantic, malevolent, ghostly being as portrayed in the last film. Kylo Ren has reservations about his position in the First Order but over-compensates with manic, ultra-violence and boiling anger. Driver’s intensity demonstrates an extraordinary acting ability to transcend the sometimes leaden dialogue that constantly repeats and sums up each and every scene leaving nothing for the audience to internalize. And while Luke and Rey spar and Kylo Ren sulks, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) has her hands full escaping with the rebels from an overwhelming attack. A well-staged space battle erupts. That’s the heavy stuff. Everything else is jokes and comedic references with a side of cheese. I found myself shaking my head more than laughing along. Hamill, though, is excellent as Luke. He makes us care about his emotional conflict, the characters, and their collective epic struggle. And this is no small task. Buried under a mass of tangled hair, an unwieldy, unkempt beard, and covered in tattered robes, Hamill emotes like he’s never done before. There are lines in his face that tell the story of a character and a franchise that has long endured. Hamill’s marvelous voice still cracks with an uncertain waiver reminding us of the youthful Skywalker. And while he has some jokey moments, the script smartly never allows him to lapse into outright parody. Luke and Leia stabilize the narrative. Naturally, Fisher’s tragic passing has made the performance even more poignant, but she made good, sincere choices in the role. And one key moment with a droid will put a lump in any hardened viewer’s throat. It’s all very necessary, because clearly the effect of the Marvel universe and Disney’s influence is at play in shaping the tone. Ultimately, fans should love this latest episode, but they will have to resolve whether the comedic elements undercut or insult the storied mythology. To be fair, humor and tongue-in-cheek cheese were always an integral part of the franchise. The technology, the thematic structure, and even the planets and the universes themselves were never meant to be analyzed in great depth. Allow me a bit of heresy: Star Wars is not serious science fiction. It is not on the same level as this year’s box office disappointment, but worthy critical darling, “Blade Runner 2049.” However, there was a time when I held in high regard the first two films that were released theatrically. “The Empire Strikes Back” still remains a high-water mark for story-telling and is easily one of the best films of the 1980s—a classic. But since “Return of the Jedi” upped the cheese factor, Lucas’ vision was never quite the same, as sadly demonstrated with his prequels. And while I loved “Jedi” at age 13, looking back, I recognize that comparing any of the episodes that followed to “Empire” is misplaced and probably unfair. “A New Hope” followed by “Empire” was a simply amazing cinematic feat that might be impossible to repeat. So, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” falls short, because it isn’t as good as “Force Awakens” and fails to capture the magic of “Empire Strikes Back.” And regardless of the jokes and ad nauseam, explicit exposition, there was enough real emotion to make me care. Given the absolute ridiculousness of so much of what happens in this unapologetic space soap opera, making me feel anything at all is an undeniable measure of success."
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE," Star Wars: The Force Awakens delivered such a delectable burst of new life to the franchise that it even convinced me to move on from some of my most beloved movie characters in favor of new ones I had just met. So why won’t Star Wars: The Last Jedi let me get on with it? Written and directed by Rian Johnson (Looper), The Last Jedi has a quirkier personality than its immediate predecessor, including a playfully comedic instinct, a particular fondness for strange creatures (porgs!), and some moments of arresting, poetic imagery. In short, it too is fun. But narratively, the movie is a bit of a placeholder. Rather than focus on the new characters we met in The Force Awakens—Jedi novice Rey (Daisy Ridley), AWOL Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega), and Resistance pilot Poe (Oscar Isaac)—The Last Jedi is mostly interested in them as they relate to two of the franchise’s original figures: Luke (Mark Hamill) and Leia (Carrie Fisher, who died after filming).  And so Rey spends much of the first half of this film where The Force Awakens left her: on the remote island where Luke has banished himself. Distraught by the fact that his former apprentice Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) has turned to the dark side, Luke thinks it would be best for the Jedi order to end with his lonely passing. As Rey tries to persuade Luke to instead join the fight against the fascist First Order, Poe spends much of his time trapped, along with Commander Leia, on a transport ship surrounded by a First Order battle fleet. Meanwhile, Finn sneaks away on his own mission to infiltrate one of those First Order ships. You can probably already see the problem. The three characters who showed great charisma and chemistry in The Force Awakens are largely kept apart in The Last Jedi, in favor of frequent scenes with Luke Skywalker. (And anyone who used to argue with childhood friends over who got stuck role playing Luke will tell you, he was never the series’ strong suit.) Thankfully, Johnson’s imagery lends Luke a gravitas and mysticism that Hamill’s acting doesn’t necessarily provide, especially during the climax. It takes Luke a while to finally draw his lightsaber, but when he finally does Johnson gives him an appropriately operatic stage on which to do it and frames him like the legend he’s become. That sequence takes place on a battlefield where white salt covers a landscape of red dirt. When even a single step is taken, crimson seeps through the mineral like blood. It’s a striking element as the fighting unfolds, with red streaks crisscrossing the land, emphasizing the cost of the warfare we’re watching. An earlier “wow” moment involves one spaceship colliding with another at light speed, resulting in an instance of immense silence and radiating rings that have a pale, deathly glow. It’s at once mournful and wonderful, and unlike anything we’ve seen before in the series. Johnson also delivers what is perhaps the most elegant explanation of the Force—that mysterious power that governs the Star Wars universe—that the franchise has given us. As Luke describes the Force as the tension that exists between light and dark, life and death, Johnson delivers a montage of images echoing these themes, helping us understand that the Force isn’t a power to be wielded (as Kylo Ren sees it), but a space to be inhabited (as Rey is learning to do). It’s telling that aside from these visual flourishes, what I found most compelling about The Last Jedi was the developing relationship between Kylo Ren and Rey, two of this saga’s new characters. They spend much of the first half of The Last Jedi messing around in each other’s heads via their manipulation of the Force, but eventually we get a high-stakes showdown where lightsabers are drawn. I won’t give anything away except to say that it contains a stark surprise and some excellent stunt work. (Rey pulls out a dropped lightsaber move that should become legendary.) It’s Rey and Ren, at least for me, who are now the heart of this saga. Here’s hoping the next episode puts them center stage."
"Dec 13, 2017",NEGATIVE,"So much movie, I think my engorged eyeballs had to stick a finger down their throats and vomit out a couple of epic battle scenes just so they could get through the finale."
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE," After an original trilogy, a prequel trilogy, a spin-off, and the first installment in a sequel trilogy, it didn’t seem that Star Wars could still surprise. They could create new creatures and amaze with effects, be they practical or elaborate CGI, and they could give us new versions of beloved archetypes, but after The Force Awakens re-hashed Episode IV and Rogue One couldn’t stop winking at what came before, it felt like maybe Star Wars had gone as far as it could, and we would spend the rest of forever treading over the same ground. Well, no. The Last Jedi proves Star Wars still has its own brand of magic and it still has the power to captivate and inspire. In fact, The Last Jedi is so thrilling and feels so NEW that watching it is perhaps something of what it was like to see Star Wars in May 1977.  The Last Jedi picks up not long after The Force Awakens, with the Rebel fleet fleeing the First Order, who now controls the galaxy, and Rey on an island with a truculent Luke Skywalker. Despite being the second installment in a Star Wars trilogy, there is no attempt to make this the Empire Strikes Back of the franchise. It’s as if writer/director Rian Johnson said, “There’s already an Empire Strikes Back, let’s do something else.” And what he does is take pieces from every previous Star Wars movie and then turn all of it on its ear. Sometimes it’s using iconic Star Wars imagery for a visual gag, sometimes it’s inverting a genre trope or taking a character in an unexpected direction. Throughout The Last Jedi, Johnson is using the language of Star Wars to push forward the narrative of Star Wars.  Forward is the only direction Johnson is interested in. JJ Abrams, because he’s JJ Abrams, planted some mysteries in The Force Awakens, chiefly “Who is Snoke, really?” and “Who are Rey’s parents?” Rian Johnson could not give two sh*ts about either of those things, and as a result, The Last Jedi MOVES FORWARD. This is the first new-era Star Wars movie that doesn’t look back in nostalgia or narrative. Every plot point is forward momentum, and if it only serves to fill in backstory that we don’t actually need, it is jettisoned in favor of development that does matter.  And man, does development matter in The Last Jedi. Everyone is undergoing growing pains. Rey (Daisy Ridley, such a fierce screen presence) is struggling with self-doubt and fear, and hoping that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) can show her the way, but Luke is wrestling his own demons and can’t see past his own failures. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is torn between his mission and his heart (Kylo Ren is the best villain Star Wars has spat out to date, yes, even better than Darth Vader. He’s more complex and unpredictable than Vader). And Poe Dameron and his fabulous f*ckin’ hair (prepare to reignite your Oscar Isaac Problem) must learn the difference between a hero and a leader before he gets everyone killed. The only characters not doing a huge amount of growing are Finn (John Boyega) and mechanic Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), and not for nothing, their subplot opens up a momentum drain that is the only weakness in The Last Jedi. Boyega and Tran are perfectly enjoyable, and their subplot isn’t a complete waste of time, but you start to feel the length of The Last Jedi when it veers off with them, and Finn’s arc is a pale echo of Poe’s so it’s not like much is being accomplished. But, as in The Force Awakens, the power of the characters compensates for plot weakness, and if The Last Jedi gets a little detour-y, it’s okay, because we like these people so damn much. So much of The Last Jedi is wonder and excitement and magic. There are images destined to be as indelible as the two suns of Tatooine—one comes with a silence so stark it sears into the mind, proof of how sound, and the lack of it, impacts cinema—and there are heroes and villains that will fuel the imagination of fans for years to come. The Last Jedi is the Star Wars for a generation, a touchstone film the way the original Star Wars was and the prequel trilogy was not. (Finally, I got to sit in a theater and watch a new Star Wars movie that took my breath away and left me buzzing with excitement and awe.) This is dazzling larger-than-life heroes and despicable villains and breathtaking space battles and narrow escapes, all held together by a band of plucky characters we love. The Last Jedi is an epic to inspire, an adventure that truly carries you to a galaxy far, far away, and will hold in your heart as all the best stories do."
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE," The Last Jedi dure 152 minutes, mais aucune n'est gaspillée. Voici un film long et dense, une œuvre épique qu'on a immédiatement hâte de revoir. Mis en scène de main de maître par Rian Johnson, qui se retrouve à la barre d’une mégaproduction pour la première fois, ce huitième épisode de la saga de la famille Skywalker renferme certaines des meilleures scènes dramatiques, comiques et d'action de toute la série, ainsi que plus de trouvailles visuelles que jamais. Moins direct dans son approche que The Force Awakens, qui nous présentait rapidement et efficacement trois nouveaux protagonistes (Rey, Finn, Poe) particulièrement attachants, en plus d'offrir à Han Solo un formidable dernier tour de piste, The Last Jedi jongle avec beaucoup de personnages et d'enjeux, positionnant soigneusement 

 le tout durant les deux premiers actes du récit, avant une dernière heure particulièrement spectaculaire.  Le téméraire Poe (Oscar Isaac) mène sous (ou envers) les ordres de la Générale Leia (la regrettée Carrie Fisher, qu’il est touchant de revoir au grand écran) une opération militaire, la première de plusieurs dans une « guerre des étoiles » qui porte véritablement bien son nom. Finn (John Boyega) reprend vie et agit à nouveau de façon impulsive, mais embrasse éventuellement son héroïsme au contact de la nouvelle venue Rose (Kelly Marie Tran). Quant à Rey (Daisy Ridley), là-bas au loin sur l’île de Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), elle le convainc peu à peu de lui enseigner à contrôler la Force… qui se manifeste de diverses façons inusitées 

pendant 

 le film, notamment à travers la mystérieuse connexion entre Rey et le torturé Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). La dynamique entre ces derniers est
l’élément narratif central du film, où l’on se demande constamment si Kylo Ren
pourrait trouver la rédemption et à l’opposé, si Rey pourrait se laisser tenter
par le côté obscur. Mais The Last Jedi n’est assurément pas que sombre et introspectif, le
film renfermant aussi beaucoup d’excellents gags et de passages époustouflants,
dont évidemment plusieurs batailles interstellaires et combats au sabre
laser savamment orchestrés. Le scénariste et réalisateur Rian Johnson se distingue sur de nombreux plans. Comme mentionné, il y a cette attention accrue portée à l'aspect « guerre » : les stratégies, la hiérarchie, le complexe militaro-industriel qui enrichit les marchands d'armes, les conséquences des conflits sur la population de la galaxie… Ces éléments sont 

entre autres

abordés via de nouveaux personnages joués par Laura Dern et Benicio Del Toro.  On devine également que Johnson a de fortes convictions écologiques, le sort des créatures animales ayant rarement eu autant d'importance dans cet univers cinématographique. Je pense bien sûr aux Porgs, ces petits oiseaux adorables dont les brèves apparitions (souvent au côté de Chewbacca!) sont toutes très mémorables, mais aussi aux Fathiers (qui s’apparentent à des chevaux) et aux Vulptices (des renards à la fourrure cristalline).  De plus, tout en étant un pur film de Star Wars, The Last Jedi multiplie les prises de vue saisissantes et les séquences

formellement

 inventives. Le film de Johnson donne l’impression qu’il a eu beaucoup de liberté pour s’amuser visuellement, pour donner un rythme ou un style différent à certains moments, bref, pour étirer un peu les limites de la formule de la franchise. Autant j’adore The Force Awakens, autant il est vrai que plusieurs éléments y étaient familiers. Mais ici, sans complètement réinventer une recette qui fonctionne, on a droit à un bon nombre de surprises. Mentionnons d’ailleurs les nouveaux décors comme la salle du trône de Snoke (Andy Serkis), d’un rouge frappant. Rouge qu’on retrouve aussi sur la surface de la planète Crait, sous une mince couche de sel. Et que dire de Canto Bight, une ville-casino à la Monte Carlo, où l’on s’attendrait presque à voir surgir un James Bond de l’espace! Puis il y a bien sûr la fascinante île où se cache Luke, aperçue à la fin de The Force Awakens, mais qu’on explore plus en détail cette fois-ci.  Pour revenir à mon point initial, The Last Jedi est long, mais surtout dense. Loin d’être un épisode inconséquent où l’on ne fait que des détours superflus en attendant le prochain film, il se passe beaucoup de choses cruciales. Je n’en révélerai évidemment aucune et je vous conseille fortement d’éviter les

spoilers

»

 (divulgâcheurs) avant d’aller le voir, mais sachez que rien ne sera plus jamais vraiment pareil après les événements présentés ici. On sent vraiment qu’on se dirige vers la finale de cette nouvelle trilogie, et on est déjà impatient de découvrir ce qui arrivera à nos héros préférés dans l’épisode IX. En ce Star Wars Day (”May the 4th be with you”), voici la une du magazine Vanity Fair, où on peut voir Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) et les nouveaux venus Finn (John Boyega) et Rey (Daisy Ridley). Revoir le Star Wars original (qui serait plus tard connu plus précisément comme Episode IV: A New Hope, mais que tout le monde a longtemps appelé simplement Star Wars), après quelques 35 ans de blockbusters hollywoodiens qui ent ont été inspirés de près ou de loin, nous fait réaliser à quel point George Lucas était un visionnaire. On voit ensuite cette image si dramatique d’un petit vaisseau spatial poursuivi par un énorme autre vaisseau et ça y est, on est happé par cette saga épique, dont le premier mouvement met en scène deux irrésistible droïdes, 

C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) et R2D2 (Kenny Baker), qui échappent aux Stormtroopers impériaux et se rendent sur la planète désertique qu’est Tatooine, à la recherche du mystérieux Obi-Wan Kenobi (Sir Alec Guiness)… Mais leur route croisera d’abord celle du jeune Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), qui se retrouvera malgré lui au centre d’une aventure intergalactique. Cette première partie du film est relativement lente et plus atmosphérique qu’explosive, contrastant fortement avec la cadence effrénée qui caractérise la majorité des blockbusters contemporains. On sent que Luke vit loin du centre de la galaxie, la guerre civile opposant les Rebelles et l’Empire n’étant pour lui qu’une rumeur distante. Le film trouve son erre d'aller lorsqu’Obi-Wan amène Luke dans la cantina de Mos Eisley où, parmi une foule formidablement bigarrée, ils rencontrent le charismatique Han Solo (Harrison Ford) et son attachant compagnon poilu Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), et encore plus lorsque la bande secourt la Princesse Leia (Carrie Fisher); les qualités de Star Wars sont nombreuses, mais la dynamique entre Luke, Han et Leia est assurément l’une des plus essentielles. À travers tout ça, Lucas frappe l’imaginaire du spectateur en présentant un univers riche en détails ainsi que la fascinante mythologie entourant les Jedi, la Force et le côté obscur de cette dernière, qui est incarné par Darth Vader (David Prowse et la voix de James Earl Jones), possiblement le méchant le plus mémorable de l’histoire du cinéma. Le rythme du film continue de s’accélérer et les scènes d’action se multiplient jusqu’à la séquence culminante, l’assaut de l’Étoile de la mort par les Rebelles en X-wings, qui demeure aussi excitante des décennies plus tard. Et la finale, avec la cérémonie des médailles, est parfaitement satisfaisante.  Cette photo a été prise par Isabelle Stephen lors du passage de l’interprète de Luke Skywalker à Fantasia il y a quelques années, à l’occasion de la première mondiale de Sushi Girl. Mais ce qui fait que The Force Awakens est aussi extraordinaire, faisant oublier les antépisodes et atteignant les sommets de la trilogie originale, c’est le développement des différents personnages, anciens et nouveaux, et la façon dont tous les conflits intergalactiques ne sont finalement qu’une toile de fond pour une tragédie familiale déchirante. On a reçu des directives claires de ne rien révéler des nombreuses surprises de l’intrigue, qu’on n’aurait pas voulu gâcher de toute façon. Mais en demeurant près de ce que les bandes-annonces ont déjà dévoilé, on peut vous dire que les protagonistes de cet Épisode VII, qui se déroule alors que la galaxie est divisée entre le Premier Ordre et la Résistance, sont Finn (John Boyega), un Stormtrooper qui a soudainement une crise de conscience, et Rey (Daisy Ridley), une jeune glaneuse solitaire.  Tous deux sont des héros réticents, comme Luke Skywalker dans le tout premier film… Et une grande partie du plaisir de The Force Awakens est de les voir gagner en confiance et prouver à tous, dont eux-mêmes, qu’ils ont leur place dans cette aventure. Rey, en particulier, m’a donné beaucoup de frissons lors du dernier acte du récit. Je n’en dirai pas plus! Évidemment, il y a aussi la nostalgie qui fait son travail, notamment lorsqu’on retrouve le Millenium Falcon, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) et Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), puis plus tard, Leia (Carrie Fisher), qui est devenue générale de la Résistance, et Luke (Mark Hamill), qui… Vous verrez! Entremêlé à cette nostalgie, il y a le sentiment que beaucoup de temps a passé, que les personnages ont vieilli et qu’ils ont traversé maints événements dramatiques… D’où cette tragédie familiale qui demeurera intentionnellement vague dans cette critique. Disons seulement que les scènes entre Han et Leia sont des plus émouvantes. Que serait un film de Star Wars sans un méchant mémorable? Nous sommes servis ici avec l’introduction de Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), un officier du Premier Ordre qui voue un culte au défunt Darth Vader. Mieux vaut ne pas en dire plus à son sujet, mais sachez qu’il est sinistre à souhait, tout en cachant une certaine vulnérabilité. Bien que tragique, le scénario de J.J. Abrams, 	Lawrence Kasdan et Michael Arndt renferme aussi beaucoup d’humour, Abrams (qui agit aussi comme réalisateur) offrant une variation de l’irrésistible dynamique entre les personnages de la trilogie originale. Rey et Finn ont beaucoup de chimie ensemble ainsi qu’avec les vétérans que sont Han et Chewie, sans oublier BB-8, le formidable nouveau droïde, qui a autant de personnalité que R2-D2. The Force Awakens déborde par ailleurs de scènes d’action excitantes et spectaculaires, qui reprennent les motifs classiques de celles des films précédents, mais en les présentant de façon rafraîchissante. Même esprit, différente énergie. Abrams n’a jamais orchestré de séquences à aussi grande échelle, pas même dans Star Trek, et il rend chacune d’entre elles épique et viscérale, de la première attaque des Stormtroopers jusqu’au duel de sabres laser final. Difficile d’expliquer à quel point le film est satisfaisant sans entrer dans les détails, mais concluons en insistant sur l’énorme éventail d’émotions que provoque The Force Awakens chez le spectateur. On n’était pas sorti d’un Star Wars aussi secoué depuis The Empire Strikes Back.  On avait déjà eu droit à Mad Max: Fury Road, qui dépeignait les efforts de femmes fortes pour échapper au patriarcat, et voici que J.J. Abrams nous offre un autre film de science-fiction qui, plutôt que de se contenter de mettre en scène les aventures d’un énième homme blanc, met de l’avant une protagoniste féminine. Certes, Return of the Jedi n’a pas la pureté de vision de Star Wars ou la noirceur de The Empire Strikes Back, mais ce film réalisé par Richard Marquand complète néanmoins la trilogie de façon franchement satisfaisante. Ce qui fait la différence pour le spectateur, c’est probablement sa perception des Ewoks. Si vous les trouvez ridicules et agaçants, ce sera difficile d’apprécier le film, où ils jouent un grand rôle. Mais si vous les trouvez drôles et adorables, peut-être parce que vous étiez enfant quand vous les avez découverts, le plaisir sera au rendez-vous. La continuité de la relation entre Han et Leia prend aussi pas mal de place et la chimie entre leurs deux interprètes fait toujours effet. De même, 

C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) et R2D2 (Kenny Baker) demeurent un duo de droïdes hilarant, ensemble ou séparément, comme lorsque C-3P0 devient une déité pour les Ewoks (!). Et dépendamment des jours, 

Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) est parfois mon personnage préféré, chacun de ses cris me faisant rire ou sourire. Pendant ce temps, il y a des combats dans l’espace, où Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) pilote le Millenium Falcon, et puis oui, sur la lune d’Endor, les Ewoks repoussent les attaques des Stormtroopers… Et c’est vraiment cool! Si voir ces petites créatures poilues tenir tête à l’Empire à coups de lances, de pierres, de cordes et de flèches ne vous réjouit pas, je ne sais pas quoi vous dire! Au final, la trilogie originale de Star Wars mérite amplement d’avoir autant eu d’impact et d’influence. Ignorons les “prequels” pour l’instant (même si elles ne sont pas si pires) et gardons espoir que le septième épisode soit à la hauteur des attentes. Qu’arrive-t-il maintenant à Han et Chewie? Leia a-t-elle profité de la Force qui est en elle? Et où donc est Luke? J’aime bien ces nouvelles affiches de Star Wars: The Force Awakens, qui mettent de l’avant autant les légendaires Princesse Leia (Carrie Fisher) et Han Solo (Harrison Ford) que les nouveaux venus Rey (Daisy Ridley) et Finn (John Boyega). Ce remake plus ou moins fidèle du film culte de 1989 recycle certains éléments du scénario original dans un contexte assez différent. Mais les grandes lignes sont là : Dalton, un type ayant la réputation de savoir se servir de ses poings, est recruté pour venir faire le ménage dans un bar routier envahi par la racaille; il développe une relation avec une infirmière du coin; un malveillant homme riche contrôle presque tout dans les environs.Le Road House de 2024 diffère notamment de son inspiration par le fait que Elwood Dalton (plutôt que James Dalton) est un ancien combattant de UFC déchu, qui mène une existence de vagabond vivant dans sa voiture lorsqu’on le rencontre, et que le bar routier qui l’engage se trouve dans les Keys de Floride plutôt qu’au Missouri. Là où le bât blesse, c’est que notre protagoniste est incarné par un Jake Gyllenhaal correct, mais loin d’être aussi iconique et badass que Patrick Swayze. De même, le méchant joué par Billy Magnussen n’arrive pas à la cheville du parfaitement détestable Ben Gazzara. Et les créateurs de cette nouvelle version n’ont même pas tenté de remplacer le vieux pote interprété par Sam Elliott! Mentionnons également qu’au lieu du Jeff Healey Band, on doit se contenter d’une succession de groupes anonymes jouant au bar alors que les bouteilles de bière volent de toute part. Bref, il s’agit indéniablement d’une pâle copie du long-métrage de Rowdy Herrington, qui n’est toutefois pas sans qualités. Malgré trop de longueurs, le remake inclut quand même plusieurs scènes d’action assez percutantes. Et à la mi-parcours, l’introduction du coloré psychopathe Knox, un rôle défendu avec enthousiasme par le véritable champion d’arts martiaux mixtes Conor McGregor, dynamise considérablement le récit. Il y a aussi une trame narrative intéressante impliquant une jeune fille (Hannah Love Lanier) travaillant dans une librairie qui compare la situation dans laquelle se retrouve Dalton à un roman western, ce qui n’est pas sans rappeler une certaine scène de Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood. En janvier, le réalisateur Doug Liman a annoncé qu’il boycotterait la première de Road House (2024) à SXSW à cause de la décision d’Amazon MGM de lancer son film directement sur la plateforme Prime Video. Ironiquement, alors qu’il aurait été difficile de recommander d’aller le voir en salle, c’est le genre de vue qui mérite quand même qu’on lui jette un coup d’œil dans le confort de chez soi, sans trop d’attentes. "
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE," “This is not going to go the way you think”, warns Luke Skywalker at one critical point in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, and it may as well be a statement on this latest chapter of the epic saga. As the middle chapter of the latest trilogy the expectations for writer/director Rian Johnson were to copy the beats of the past, in particular the dire, hopeless stretch of The Empire Strikes Back. But, this doesn’t go the way you think, not by a long shot. The Last Jedi repeatedly goes against your every instinct, takes your emotions for a roller coaster, and takes the characters we know in directions that will blow your mind. Plenty of movies give me goosebumps but nothing quite like the opening crawl of a Star Wars film, and this one sets up what may be the most exciting opening sequence the franchise has seen yet.  A blistering, edge-of-your-seat aerial sequence featuring the cocky X-Wing pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) as he bucks the orders of General Leia (the late Carrie Fisher, magnificent in her final role) sets up what is also the most humanist film in the franchise. Johnson has dedicated his film to defining what the Resistance is really fighting for and showing who they are fighting to protect.  With the First Order breathing down their necks, the Resistance is forced into a dangerous gambit with little time to pull off. In some way all of the Star Wars movies are of the “ticking clock” variety, but Johnson adds a new level of urgency, raising the stakes as every crucial hour passes. If the Resistance falls, all hope of peace in the galaxy falls with it. There are multiple storylines at play here and Johnson gives them all equal footing, even though one promises bigger repercussions for the future. The backdrop of everything is the decimated Resistance fleet and the head-butting between Poe, Leia, and Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) in trying to find a means of escape.  As seen at the finale of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Rey (Daisy Ridley) has journeyed to the hidden island of Ahch-To where she hopes to lure Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) out of his hermit existence to fight again. She also needs training in the Force, although she finds his willingness to be a mentor is lacking. And then there’s the newly-recovered Finn (John Boyega) and technician Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) as they head to the casino planet Canto Bight to find a hacker who break into the First Order’s systems.  Meanwhile, Kylo Ren is also in search of something…an equal, an understanding, perhaps even balance? The connection sensed between him and Rey has only grown stronger, and one of the film’s many tantalizing mysteries is exactly why they share such a bond. Johnson, to his credit, does answer a few of the biggest nagging questions while leaving others just out of reach. Never content to do what is simple or familiar, Johnson takes his crack at Star Wars to explore a much larger landscape, one beyond easy notions of good and evil, light vs. dark. The casino world of Canto Bight, an extravagant haven for the galaxy’s richest, reveals a dark underbelly that profits from the misfortune caused by the ongoing conflicts.  Benicio Del Toro’s bizarre “slicer” DJ also fits into a certain grey area, more so than Han Solo or Lando Calrissian or any of the other roguish characters that populate this universe. His presence challenges notions of heroism, and we see that idea repeated in different ways throughout, especially as the defiant Poe challenges the wise council of those more experienced than him. This is the biggest movie of Johnson’s career, having established his fan-favorite cred quietly with the film noir Brick, storybook heist fantasy The Brothers Bloom, and ambitious sci-fi flick Looper. You can tell he’s having a ball playing on the canvas George Lucas built, but he isn’t beholden to it in the way The Force Awakens was. You can see it in the action scenes which give a fresh angle to X-wing/Tie Fighter battles we’ve so many times before. There are shots here that he and longtime DP Steve Yedlin must have been dreaming up for years, just hoping for the opportunity to use them. They leave behind some truly indelible images and aren’t afraid to reference modern pop culture while doing so. Particularly unforgettable are the Casino Royale-esque Canto Bight, and the red salt planet of Caith. The crimson-scarred battlefield left behind after an epic fight will be seared into your memory. Both locations, not to mention the Dagobah-like Ahch-To, have many more stories left to be told. Hopefully there won’t be any more stories left featuring the annoying Porgs. The screeching bird creatures are everywhere and are the most useless part of the movie. There’s no way Johnson wrote them into the story himself because they serve literally no purpose other than to sell toys. Keep in mind I’m someone who despises the “adorable” Ewoks, and yet they are a million times better than the Porgs.  Your mileage may very on them but I kept hoping they’d end up in Chewbacca’s stomach, not scrambling around the Millennium Falcon.  If I had any other major complaints it would be in the pacing, which tends to drag while Johnson juggles three slow-moving storylines. And there’s disappointment in a couple of supporting characters that look awesome but fail to measure up even to Darth Maul’s low bar. While there aren’t the dizzying influx of new characters like in the prior movie, the ones we do get are significant in different ways. Dern’s Holdo spins the Resistance power structure and places another strong, heady female at the top of the food chain. Meanwhile, I suspect there will be a split reaction to Kelly Marie Tran as Rose. For me I loved seeing an Asian-American character getting some shine and earning her moment in the spotlight. Her adventure alongside Finn has the most swashbuckling fun of them all, but you don’t get that spark between the characters that Johnson was clearly hoping for. On the other hand I love every interaction between Ridley and Driver, both of their characters trying to fill an empty void left behind by family or those they trusted.  We’ve never seen a relationship quite like theirs in all of Star Wars; you could make some of the push/pull between the dark and light side of the Force is similar to what Luke Skywalker went through, but he never had an equal counterpart. Speaking of which, Skywalker is crucial to this story in so many ways and the journey he undergoes feels so natural, it makes so much sense. While you may not always like the twists and turns it takes, that’s only the disorientation of seeing everything you knew upended. It’s a good thing. While Johnson takes Star Wars to uncharted territory, trust that he includes plenty of cornball one-liners, cheesy declarations about destiny, and so forth that we have come to love. They’re a part of why we love these movies, though, and The Last Jedi is going to be loved by millions who will want to revisit it again and again. I know I will."
"Dec 13, 2017",NEGATIVE," For a Star Wars fan like myself (I still have the original 1977 program sold in the lobby), screening Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker was both a proverbial labor of love AND a duty. My fervent anticipation of a new Star Wars flick was still flickering. Per se. However, News Flash: This grand finale to the “Skywalker Saga” nine films is a must see, but a bit disappointing. Credit J. J. Abrams, who co-wrote, co-produced and directed this episode as well as episode 7, The Force Awakens, in 2015. In his defense, it was a daunting task to tether all the plot lines and character elements into a cohesive conclusion. Think of all the characters from Luke Skywalker to Darth Vader to Palpatine to Kylo Ren and Rey. Then there are the robots, storm troopers, brothers and sisters (Luke and Leia), husbands and wives (Han and Leia), and various planet inhabitants. If it sounds like a bulk of beings to squeeze into 142 minutes, it is because it is. As a result, one has to look fast and wide to glimpse the many cameos and walk-ons.  The end result is an obviously huge scale action-adventure tale with state of the art effects and sparse time for good natured joking and character development. Then again, why is character development necessary? In most of the movie, it isn’t needed. We already know these people, these creatures, these robots. However, major characterization change does occur with two of the principal characters: the last Jedi Ren (played by Daisy Ridley); and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), the Supreme Leader of the First Order and son of Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford).  To summarize the overall plot, using studio publicity, The Rise of Skywalker takes place “a year after the events of The Last Jedi. The remnants of the Resistance face the First Order once again—while reckoning with the past and their own inner turmoil. Meanwhile, the ancient conflict between the Jedi and the Sith reaches its climax.” It is good seeing Carrie Fisher return as Leia, albeit via clever editing and unused footage from The Force Awakens. (Fisher died in 2016.) And 82 year-old Billy Dee Williams has more than just a line or two in his return as Lando Calrissian, the original owner of the Millennium Falcon.  Richard E. Grant, last year’s Best Supporting Actor Oscar winner for Can You Ever Forgive Me?, displays his evil chops as First Order General Pryde. The long list of Star Wars returnees  includes Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Oscar Isaac (Poe Dameron), Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Lupita Nyong’o (Maz Kanata), Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine/Darth Sidious), John Boyega (Finn), and Joonas Suotamo (Chewbacca). Spoiler Alert: There are some surprise characters returning as well as some surprise deaths. That’s all I will reveal….except to look for a sea of quicksand.  Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker lacks the outright fun and originality of the previous episodes, but it achieves its goal of providing big scale closure."
"Dec 13, 2017",NEUTRAL,[Johnson] does his best work in The Last Jedi when he stops trying for narrative complexity and just stages some cool outer-space action.
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE,"It arrives at a very dark moment indeed, and yet like the movies that preceded it, it speaks very powerfully to where we're at right now."
"Dec 13, 2017",POSITIVE," Episode VIII arrives in theaters with quieter thunder than
its predecessor, The Force Awakens. But,
although the box office returns for The
Last Jedi will almost certainly fall short of the mark set by the 2015
installment, no one should mistake this movie for anything less than a money-making
behemoth, further cementing Star Wars
as the most financially lucrative franchise of all time, regardless of whether
inflation adjustments are being applied or not.  With Rian Johnson inheriting characters and situations from
J.J. Abrams, the movie breaks with Star Wars
tradition and begins exactly where its predecessor left off. Although Johnson
doesn’t mine Star Wars history as
extensively as Abrams did to concoct his narrative, echoes and call-backs are
inevitable and will be noticeable even to the casual viewer. If you’ve seen The Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi, you’ll experience the
occasional déjà vu moment. Perhaps that’s inevitable when approaching a
franchise of this nature. Johnson, however, doesn’t play things as safe as
Abrams and some of his story points are unexpected. In fact, he not only
advances the overall narrative but brings it almost to a conclusion. There
seems to be very little left for Episode IX to accomplish beyond tying up some
loose ends.  The Last Jedi is a
film of moments. There are perhaps a half-dozen of them: goose-pimple inducing,
fist-pump encouraging, heart-racing bursts of cinematic satisfaction. The
problem is that the narrative threads connecting them are lazily knitted and
sometimes tangled or broken. The overall plot is underwhelming and there’s far too
much padding, especially during the first hour. There’s a sense that Johnson is
giving busy-work to certain characters while others are catching up. The Last Jedi is a great 105-minute
movie stretched too thin.  Perhaps the most telling thing we’ve learned from The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi is that George Lucas was
right with his 2005 claim (later reversed) that there wouldn’t be an Episode
VII because there was no more story to tell. Filmmakers can bring back Han,
Luke, and Leia but that doesn’t mean there’s a compelling narrative for them. Return of the Jedi, for all its faults, was
a triumphant end to Luke’s journey, Anakin’s arc, and the Empire/Rebellion war.
For this post-Lucas trilogy, the stakes seem smaller, the villains less
intimidating, and the story too familiar. Every new movie gives us additional
planets but, with the last two films, the far, far away galaxy seems to be
shrinking.  When we last left Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Rey (Daisy
Ridley), they were standing atop a mountain sizing up each other. The latter
was earnest as she held out a lightsaber to its rightful owner. The former
looked peeved, probably because it had taken the whole of The Search for Luke Skywalker to get to him and the moment passed
without a line of dialogue. Well, in The
Last Jedi, Luke speaks and much of what he has to say isn’t happy or
inspirational. He may look like Obi-Wan in A New Hope, but he’s not much interested in teaching Rey or returning with
her to play the role of heroic icon. And he’s not as lonely on the isolated
planet as it initially seems. He has all sorts of CGI-created friends,
including the penguin-like porgs, which ended up in a Star Wars movie on their way to a Pixar film. Has there ever been a
more annoyingly cute, merchandise-friendly creature? Oh, yeah: Ewoks.  While Luke and Rey are playing their game of will-he-won’t-he-train-her,
the Resistance is in trouble. Apparently, there aren’t many ships left in the
fleet and, after the First Order catches them fleeing their latest hidden base,
there are destined to be fewer of them. Still, ex-Princess-now-General Leia
(Carrie Fisher in her final performance) is nothing if not determined. When
hotshot pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) disobeys an order, it results in
massive losses in service of a major victory. But the Resistance is trapped and
the end appears nigh, especially when Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis, doing
his usual motion-capture thing) shows up in person to confer with his minions,
Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and General Hux (a frothing-at-the-mouth Domhnall
Gleeson). Meanwhile, back with the Resistance, injured hero Finn (John Boyega)
wakes up and embarks on a filler quest accompanied by newcomer Rose Tico (Kelly
Marie Tran) and R2-D2 knock-off BB8.  Without question, the best scenes in The Last Jedi feature Mark Hamill and, being a fan of old, Johnson
makes sure that Luke is given his due. He’s not a secondary player thrown onto
the screen to stoke the fires of nostalgia. He has a major part to play in the
way things evolve and nothing that Johnson accomplishes over the course of this
movie undoes any of Luke’s monumental legacy.  The yin-yang between Kylo Ren and Rey represents one of the
more intriguing elements of The Last Jedi
– it’s a concrete embodiment of the Dark Side/Light Side conflict that we haven’t
previously seen in the movies and offers the possibility of differing paths
existing for each character. Rey hints at seeing a future in which Ren stands
with the forces of Light; conversely, Ren envisions a darker road for Rey. Meanwhile,
Luke is haunted by his perceived failings and all these years later, he still
grapples with his own impure tendencies. When The Last Jedi focuses on these characters and their stories, it’s
on solid ground.  Prior to hearing Mark Hamill’s first words as Luke in 34
years, we are treated to an impressively rendered space battle. This pits the
Resistance’s few remaining fighters against the First Order’s more impressive
fleet in a desperate attempt to destroy the newest weapon in the villains’ arsenal:
the mini-Death Star-esque Dreadnaught. From a technical standpoint, the
sequence recalls the opening fight of Revenge of the Sith, where Anakin and Obi-Wan lead a mission to rescue Palpatine
from Dooku.  As an easily-digestible piece of pop culture, The Last Jedi does its job even if it
takes longer than is necessary to do it. But nothing about Star Wars is ever that simple because every frame gets studied,
parsed, and dissected by a passionate fandom. Will The Last Jedi be like Revenge
of the Sith, which received a lukewarm reception upon release but has gained
in respect over the years? Or perhaps The
Force Awakens, which was loved far and wide in December 2015 but has seen a
dramatic reversal in opinion during the two years since it debuted? Or perhaps
something else?  The reason to see The
Last Jedi (not that anyone needs one beyond the Star Wars moniker) is for those half-dozen moments I mentioned
above. There’s enough verve and artistry here to tip my thumb skyward and avoid
the tomato from going rotten. But I’ll admit to having been disappointed by
aspects of the scope and scale of the narrative, especially considering the high
regard in which I hold Johnson (his Looper
was my #1 film of 2012). Standout,
signature scenes make for moments of great viewing power but can’t hide the flaws
of an untidy, overlong story. "
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," The new Star Wars, Episode VIII: The Last Jedi is shockingly good. You’d expect it to be loud and gargantuan and to hit its marks in the manner of J.J. Abrams’s The Force Awakens, which was the first episode under Disney’s aegis — as well as the first to leave George Lucas behind, presumably counting his money and lamenting the fickleness of fans. What you’d never dare expect is high style, let alone the kind of emotion that holds you through the requisite hopscotching among three different story arcs. There’s no such thing anymore as a straight, single-strand narrative in this kind of “universe” movie, which has a mandate to look backward and forward as well as sideward at any character with the potential to be spun off into his or her own vehicle. But the new writer-director, Rian Johnson, isn’t an impersonal technician (or a rote imitator, like Abrams). He pinpoints the intersection between characters’ desperate need to belong and the special effects that will lift those longings into the realm of myth. He achieves what no one else has since The Empire Strikes Back: a fusion of junkyard genre parts and passion. Daisy Ridley returns as Rey, the orphan who, last time out, discovered that she had the Force (you either got it or you don’t) and used it to repel an attack by the callow Darth Vader wannabe Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) — after which she took off (with Chewbacca and R2-D2) for the rocky island where Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) lives in self-imposed exile. It was a holy moment at the end of The Force Awakens when she came face-to-face with him at the top of a long line of steps, bearing his old lightsaber. It’s an unholy moment in The Last Jedi when the last Jedi tosses it away and returns to his cave to feel sorry for himself. Not Yoda will he be, apparently. What’s eating Luke? It takes Rey a while to get the full story. In the meantime, who should show up in visions but Ren, who carves out a quiet space in a parallel realm in which he and Rey share their innermost thoughts. She’s convinced that despite his fealty to the creepy Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis plus CGI as the love child of Gollum and Voldemort), she can reach the core of Jedi decency in him, much as Luke once stirred the long-dormant heart of Darth Vader. But Luke has his doubts about Ren. Perhaps it had something to do with how the little shit skewered his own dad. The Rey-Luke-Ren triangle is really the main story line, but much time is taken up by Star Wars’ new high-flying cowboy, Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), and his tussles with rebel leaders General Leia (Carrie Fisher, RIP) and Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern) over attacking the First Order’s mighty fleet (Poe’s preference) or getting the hell out of there. The third strand features Finn (John Boyega) and the small but huge-spirited rebel Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), who rocket (or whatever the appropriate verb is) off to disable the source some sort of First Order something something. (It doesn’t matter what it is — it’s a MacGuffin.) To pass the time, they need to find a space-age safecracker, who happily turns out to be the sleepy-eyed, pervy-vibed Benicio del Toro, who only has to gaze on a female character to lift a film into the realm of a borderline R rating. However much I love The Last Jedi, there’s a lot of sleight-of-hand involved in making you think that the plot is moving forward instead of in circles. The first demolished space cannon is very exciting, the twelfth a bit of been-there-exploded-that. And how can it be that, however traumatic the intervening decades, the open-faced, shining-eyed Luke Skywalker has evolved into a raspy, hirsute, get-off-my-lawn old fart? Luke Cavesulker is more like it. Not even Yoda can get a smile out of him. You know he’ll have to pull himself together — his Jedi directive is to pass his accumulated wisdom on — but he sure takes his sweet time doing it. When he does, his Obi-Wan serenity amid chaos gladdens the heart. Carrie Fisher doesn’t get as many big moments as you’d hope for — probably because the filmmakers were holding off for the trilogy’s final film, which was meant to be her showcase. (The first was Harrison Ford’s, this one Hamill’s.) But it’s moving to hear her soulful croak for the last time. It took 40 years, but she and Leia finally merged. The joys outweigh the downers tenfold. It’s fun to see Isaac’s smirk of superiority get wiped off his face by women whose minds are stuck on the survival of the entire galactic anti-fascist movement. (Yes, Dern plays a killjoy for most of the film, but it’s worth it for her final scene.) Domhnall Gleeson has a meaty comic role as the First Order’s imperious General Hux: The more he asserts his dignity, the more he’s reduced by his betters to a pulling ninny. Kelly Marie Tran has a delightful way of tagging along after Finn like a lovelorn groupie before knocking him for a loop or saving him from himself. Johnson might be stuck with multiple story lines, but each has its own look, its own palette to match the many motifs in John Williams’s ever-invigorating score, which quotes from itself constantly and still sounds fresh. The showstopper is the throne room of the snooty Snoke, with its luminous crimson walls that silhouette an array of elite samurai guards — it’s like an avant-garde Aida. The climactic throne-room lightsaber battle is choreographed and shot like nothing in this generally flat-footed series. Johnson doesn’t cut on the saber clacks the way Lucas did. He has the fighters go at it in breathtakingly long shots, their whole bodies charged. It feels like the first time since The Empire Strikes Back that the Force has extended to the director. Even the usual merchandisable beasties are unusually easy to take, among them a pop-eyed, puffin-like bird that attaches itself to Chewbacca, and eerily beautiful crystalline foxes that eye Leia and company enigmatically as the rebels barricade themselves in a cave and prepare for a possible last stand. Ridley’s Rey is even more appealing here — plucky, steadfast, doggedly determined to find her place in the cosmos. But the core of The Last Jedi — of this whole trilogy, it seems — is Driver’s Kylo Ren, who ranks with cinema’s most fascinating human monsters. He makes his entrance in a skinny black head-helmet, so cute and pathetically hopeful, like an 8-year-old in a Darth Vader Halloween costume. Told by the Supreme Leader that he looks like an idiot (or words to that effect), Driver’s Ren rips off the helmet and — in another of his toddlerish tantrums — smashes it to a pulp. When he and Rey telepathically communicate, he keeps his emotions shrouded, and you never tire of searching that shroud for glimmers of light. Driver’s actual visage — a Modigliani portrait come to life — is more unnerving than the helmet. It’s Vader’s mask incarnate."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"  There are a few plot problems too. The biggest one being the time structure of the whole film. Perhaps once again taking a cue from Empire and that film’s own chronology confusion, The Last Jedi depicts both major story strands as taking place while the First Order and the Resistance are engaged in a total stalemate battle situation. The clock is apparently ticking down to a win for the Empire, but at no point do we feel the sense of urgency that this should give proceedings.  There’s also a strong sense by the end of the film that, particularly for the Rebels, nothing they have done has particularly achieved anything worthwhile. They spend the entire film escaping from one place to the next, and it feels more out of plot contrivance rather than design. At the other end of the importance scale, a middle scene promoting animal rights activism on behalf of racehorse-like species just feels unnecessary when everything else in play feels like it has such higher stakes. But then this is Star Wars and we measure these films against a higher benchmark than most movies. On the whole, this is a great step forward for the franchise – it’s deeper, it’s darker and it has porgs. Perhaps most interestingly, after having so many unanswered questions teased out in The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi goes a long way in answering almost all of them, leaving us with only one question left: What's going to happen next? "
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,Nothing can prepare you for what Star Wars: The Last Jedi delivers and that's exactly what makes so damn near perfect.
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"While I have laughed at times during previous ""Star Wars"" movies, I did not expect to do so as quickly as ""The Last Jedi"" made me."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"[Rain] Johnson crafts an entertaining, swashbuckling flick in the series' eighth film. It possesses the whimsy, the heart and light sabers necessary for reverence in the Star Wars canon."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Let’s cut to the chase: The Last Jedi, the eighth episode of the increasingly massive Star Wars chronicle, is wonderful. It’s the Star Wars movie we deserve, not because it’s some perfect piece of cinema, but because it’s as good as a movie could possibly be with this many obligations—to fans and newcomers, old markets and new ones, with every variety of expectation laid at its feet by eager audiences worldwide—and then some. It’s one of the few franchise sequels of any kind in recent memory that feels like it could stand on its own—a feat in and of itself. It’s also, quite simply, a big, glorious, heartfelt, satisfying piece of pop filmmaking, the kind of movie we haven’t seen from a major movie studio in way too long.  The movie’s director, Rian Johnson, previously known for the well-regarded genre throwbacks Brick and Looper, has thrown everything he knows into this project. It’s very much a “My parents let me borrow the keys to the Corvette for prom and this will never happen again SO LET’S MAKE IT COUNT” kind of movie—the kind you make in case Disney never lets you through the front gates again. That’s sort of funny, because it turns out Johnson will, in fact, helm a standalone Star Wars trilogy, and that’s undoubtedly because of how well he did this time around.  It’s a generous piece of filmmaking. The Last Jedi is a sprawling—at 152 minutes, you could say overlong, and you wouldn’t be totally wrong—tribute to the franchise’s past and future, with enough fan service and enough of the franchise’s recognizable house style to make sense as part of the greater story, but enough of Johnson and his collaborators’ own sense of invention to make the movie feel almost personal. All the standbys are here. We get Jedi training sessions and needlessly complex covert ops, a handsome introduction to an odd new planet (this time, it’s a monied haven for über-rich gamblers with fat jowls, big coifs, and bad attitudes), hero shots, righteous cameos, and explosions, explosions, explosions. The Last Jedi’s success is not in reinventing the wheel; it’s in revitalizing it.  That’s more than I can say for the two previous entries in the franchise, The Force Awakens and Rogue One, both of which let me down, but for different reasons. J.J. Abrams’s Force Awakens was a likable-enough bit of throat clearing, the kind of movie you have to make to regain the public’s trust after the debacle of George Lucas’s prequels (which I don’t entirely hate). It was too committed to the blueprints already laid out by the originals. Gareth Edwards’s Rogue One, meanwhile, felt a little too serious: It was the politics of the Star Wars universe stripped of all the glorious details and inventive minutiae that made these worlds worth saving (let alone watching). It was Star Wars for normies. The Last Jedi is the ideal mix of both: serious in its study of intergalactic power and the primacy of the Jedi legend while also being rife with the joys of so many beings, from so many planets, working together to save their universe. The basic story is, as ever, a battle between good and evil. On the one hand, there’s the First Order, led by Supreme Leader Snoke (a phenomenal Andy Serkis), a powerful old pain in the ass who, among other things, has command over the dark-sided Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and the less powerful but sufficiently ridiculous General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson). On the other sits the Resistance, led by the regal Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher), whose endgame is restoring the power of the great, fallen Republic back to the people. It’s a battle that, so far, the Resistance—even with the help of passionate firebrands like Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac); Finn (John Boyega), a lapsed Stormtrooper; and a wonderful newcomer, Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran)—seems primed to lose. Hence the need for some Jedi intervention. The Last Jedi twines the fight of the Resistance with the story of Rey (Daisy Ridley) seeking out Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), at Leia’s request, to ask for his help. That’s the logline, anyway. We all (or at least those of us who’ve seen The Force Awakens) know that Rey is really here to discover things about herself, and her own power. Beyond that, she learns more, about the Force and, most especially, about Kylo Ren. All those parts of the story matter. But nothing in Johnson’s movie impressed me as much as the little details, the things that make this franchise stand out from others. Look at the way Supreme Leader Snoke’s bodyguards, cloaked in devilishly red suits of armor, carry themselves, with a sleek, ninja-like sense of individual prowess. Look at the creatures on Luke’s exile planet: the Caretakers with their nunly robes and demeanor; the beautifully adorable porgs, which look like the evolutionary result of the cutest penguin mating with the cutest puppy; and whatever those big monsters are that Luke milks for green fizz (you’ll see). It all feels thought through, natural, and not unnecessarily showy — just as the action in the film, and the many climactic lightsaber duels, feels motivated by the characters’ passions and their commitment to their ideals, rather than like gratuitous excuses to show action. There are moments here that truly wowed me: a gag with an iron that becomes a gleeful in-joke, a suicide mission late in the film whose utter sense of sacrifice makes the entire movie fall silent. It’s all quite a sight. That isn’t to say that the movie, which suffers slightly from the “too many endings” problem that dampened Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and is curiously fussy about things like gender and power, is perfect or beyond reproach. A movie with this many responsibilities can’t be perfect. But The Last Jedi is more than worthy of carrying on the franchise’s legacy. Hamill is better here than he’s ever been in a Star Wars movie, and so is Fisher. Both show up to play Luke and Leia like grizzled veterans who’ve seen it all, Fisher with a greater sense of majesty and hope, Hamill with more than his share of disillusionment. The movie is a tribute to the franchise’s past that embraces the fierce certainty of its future and the ability of its new generation—Ridley, Isaac, Driver, Boyega, Tran, and the rest—to carry the franchise forward. It’s such a successful changing of the guard that by the end I wondered if this could be it: This could be the last Star Wars movie. If it were the end—and of course it’s not—it’d be a way to close out the franchise on a robust, satisfying note. This is a movie not only for Star Wars fans but also for fans of losing themselves in, and falling in love with, blockbuster movies. That’s a feeling most Hollywood movies have forgotten—and The Last Jedi is here to make us remember it. Three days after its release, how’s the double album landing? And was Swift’s approach to this highly personal project successful? Nora Princiotti and Nathan Hubbard discuss on ‘Every Single Album.’ Nora and Nathan are here to dive into the album and discuss ""Fortnight,"" how Swift is grappling with her level of fame, and much more!"
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Plot: Set in a galaxy far, far away Rey (Daisy Ridley) travels to the remote planet of Ahch-To, where she looks to develop and hone her newfound abilities under the guidance of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). However, the legendary Jedi is shocked and unsettled by just how powerful Rey is. At the same time, the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) and with Poe (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) in tow, prepares to do battle with The First Order and Snoke (Andy Serkis), Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson). Review: In the immediate aftermath of “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” you’ll feel genuinely dazed by what you’ve just seen. Dazzled, too, as writer and director Rian Johnson kicks the film into hyperdrive from the off, never relenting as the film unfolds with such intensity and at such a ferocious lightspeed that you’re constantly left in awe by the sheer ambition of the storytelling, the scale of its set-pieces, and the striking gorgeousness of its visuals. But while familiar, this is a “Star Wars” film that isn’t overly beholden to its past, playing with the tropes, themes, and characters of its predecessors in a way that is both unsettling but necessary. You can immediately understand why Lucasfilm have trusted Rian Johnson with his own “Star Wars” trilogy. Because while the humor (it is probably the funniest “Star Wars” film yet) and all round fun that has made the franchise so popular is present, it’s more political, emotionally complex, and muddled than before. Not all of it works. Some of its surprises and twists underwhelm. In fact, occasionally, it brought to mind the legendary British comedy sketch from Morecambe and Wise with Andre Previn, where, after being accused of misplaying a song on the piano, Eric Morecambe responds, “I am playing all the right notes. But not necessarily in the right order.” Things are never so drastic that “The Last Jedi” flounders, just so intense and new that it is disconcerting. This is a film that will take many views to truly absorb. But those worries are quickly eclipsed by the moments and shocks that do land. Ferociously. So much so that you’ll want to leap onto your feet and scream with joy. And while the film doesn’t necessarily drag, come its conclusion you do feel drained and are well aware of its 2 hour and 32 minute long running. Considering what it puts you through, though, that’s to be expected. Ultimately, “The Last Jedi” might not be the greatest “Star Wars” film ever made, as it lacks the wonderment and joy of “The Empire Strikes Back” and “A New Hope,” something that, in all honesty, will probably never be replicated again in movie history. But “The Last Jedi” is the film from which a new galaxy and universe will build, as it taps into what made its past so glorious, propels it forward, and gives the “Star Wars” franchise the rejuvenation that it never even knew it needed."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," To say that Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi is watchable even by those who have zero investment in the Star Wars franchise or its characters may sound like faint praise, but it’s really the highest. Johnson, who also wrote the script, has taken a property—one that by this point has so many characters, so much mythology and so many requirements—and given us an actual movie. Most big-ticket franchise filmmaking these days amounts to ticking off a series of boxes. If Johnson has ticked any, he’s done it in private, shielding us from all those horrid practicalities. His movie has a sense of humor about itself and a sense of joy, but its emotional generosity, even in the midst of all the extravagant green-screen work, is its best special effect. He’s taken Disney’s money and given the audience all the things money can’t buy: Instead of selling to us, he’s speaking to us. You can feel the difference. The story, peopled by characters created in a galaxy far, far away by George Lucas, is easy to grasp even for neophytes: The old Empire has crumbled and the fascist First Order has risen in its wake. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), an ambitious up-and-comer in the world of evil, taking all his cues—and wardrobe inspiration—from his idol Darth Vader, has been currying favor with the First Order Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), a sinister boss king who looks like a desiccated 200-year-old Kirk Douglas in one of Lana Turner’s Adrian gowns. But some of the wind has gone out of Ren’s sails: Last time around, in the 2015 The Force Awakens (directed by J.J. Abrams), he killed Han Solo (Harrison Ford), who, it turned out, was his own father. It’s clear he hasn’t felt so great since. When he removes his Vaderesque mask for the first time in The Last Jedi, his face bears physical scars and emotional ones, mostly around the eyes: As Driver plays him, even his irises look bruised. Meanwhile, the Resistance rages, both surreptitiously and obviously, against the First Order. Domhnall Gleeson’s officious General Hux is the commander of a warship ready to whup the Resistance’s ass—he’s advancing on the ship commanded by the group’s leader, former-princess-now-general Leia (Carrie Fisher), and in the movie’s early moments, he gets on the horn to give scrappy Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) what for. Poe responds with a virtual yawn: He hears every word Hux is saying, but he acts as if he couldn’t care less. Hux’s fuse is lit. “Open fiah!” he commands, in a line that brings down the house. A ridiculous bully who thinks he’s classy is one of the funniest things in the world, and Johnson signals to us that he knows it. From there, The Last Jedi takes off like a shot. Johnson has to deal with the classic Star Wars franchise problems—you’ve got to find something meaningful for all these characters to do, and all of it must cohere into an at least semi-meaningful plot. At times the movie feels cluttered. How could it not be? But Johnson makes the most of individual scenes, shaping each with care and vigor. And he does well by every character, the old ones—like Storm Trooper-turned-Resistance-fighter Finn (John Boyega)—as well as the new: Laura Dern shows up as a military leader with a fluff of violet flapper hair that belies the steel at her core. And the movie introduces a sweetly appealing character named Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), a shy Resistance underling who at first worships the movement’s heroes, and then gets a chance to become one herself. Johnson even introduces a flicker of unrequited love between Finn and Rose. But Finn’s heart, as we already know, belongs to the Force powerhouse orphan Rey (Daisy Ridley), who has found her way—piloting the late Han Solo’s cherished Millennium Falcon—to the island on which Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), a Jedi who’s lost every drop of his mojo, has sequestered himself. The scenes on this island are the movie’s quietest, and its best. It’s a gorgeous rocky landscape, shivering in its desolate beauty. The island is home to a bunch of adorable chubby birds known as porgs, as well as creaky nunlike characters who maintain, with crotchety strictness, the cavelike structures that hold all those ancient Jedi secrets. This is the Michael Powell section of the film, evoking both the weird dreaminess of the great English filmmaker’s Black Narcissus and the rugged half-natural half-mystical landscape of his Hebrides love letter The Edge of the World. Cinematographer Steve Yedlin makes its mysteries sing. Rey needs to persuade Luke to come back to the Resistance fight, but he resists. He’s a shell of his old, swaggering self, a gaunt figure in a hooded cloak: All the fight has been beaten out of him, but Hamill’s performance nonetheless shows us the still-burning soul cowering deep inside this husk of a man. Luke gets the movie’s most glorious moment, and also its funniest; Hamill deserves both. Johnson made his entrance as a filmmaker with the 2005 indie hit Brick, and his last feature was the 2012 futuristic crime drama Looper. Neither picture would suggest that he’d be this good at huge-budget mega-blockbuster fantasy filmmaking. But as it turns out, he has a gift for orchestrating massive action scenes with specificity and a light touch: The finest is a multi-player light saber battle that’s regal and thrilling, a gorgeous set piece that seems to take its cues in part from Balinese puppet theater. There’s wonderful stuff here, like a gang of friendly crystal foxes who skitter across an icy landscape on dainty tapered paws. And an old, pointy-eared favorite makes a ghostly, thoughtful cameo. But it’s Johnson’s handling of Leia’s character that says the most about his approach to the material. Because Fisher is now gone, you’d assume that Johnson would have written Leia out of the story with a grand, melodramatic flourish. That’s what almost any other filmmaker would have done, and it would have been fine. Instead, Johnson gives us something at once more delicate and more satisfying. We’ve already had to say goodbye to Fisher in real life. In The Last Jedi, Johnson gives her an alternate ending, refusing to milk tears from us and instead allowing us to revel in all that was great about her, her sandpaper-velvet voice and her decisive way around a wisecrack. No matter how much money has been poured into a movie, it’s emotional generosity that matters, and Johnson gives without squandering. His great gift is that he knows when to stop."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,The spectacles in Star Wars: The Last Jedi are some of the most powerful and believable in the franchises.
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,Have we ever had a relaunch followed immediately by a reboot?
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," When The Force Awakens landed two years ago, it was everything Star Wars fans wanted yet not entirely what we needed. It was a rousing tribute missing its own vision, introducing new characters and crises hinting at old ones. Star Wars: The Last Jedi launches the franchise to another level of action and humor thanks to incoming writer-director Rian Johnson, whose imagination seems boundless as George Lucas' 40 years ago. Johnson conjures a far, far away galaxy in the original Jedi master's image of violent oppression and valiant rebellion, a family feud and cosmic obligations. A new generation of heroes and villains ushered by The Force Awakens stirred the Skywalker saga; The Last Jedi effectively hands it over. Mark Hamill's cameo return as Luke Skywalker is now the cerebral and emotional core of Johnson's screenplay, a tenfold payoff after a fade out letdown. Carrie Fisher's death imbues each of her scenes as Princess Leia, now a General in the resistance, with a wistfulness aiding the drama. Disney asks critics to avoid spoiler details — the movie's packed with them — and I'm inclined to agree. But there's a scene involving Leia in danger that unfolds so beautifully, so ethereally that it could be a requiem for a queen. Fisher's line readings, snappy and sad sometimes at once, will be missed. (Or will they?) The Skywalker saga and characters keep thickening under Johnson's watch, starting with ace Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac, previously underused). Poe's one-ship assault on a massive First Order weapon ship sets a high bar for action that'll be topped later. Poe also sets the movie's lighter-then-ever tone, cockily trolling General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson). First Order Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis in motion capture) is still working on wiping out the Resistance. Finding and eliminating Luke Skywalker is a key step. Luke's living like a hermit on Ahch-To island where Rey (Daisy Ridley) traveled to deliver his lightsaber, hoping to draw him back into the battle. Rey's own link to the Force puts her in tele-contact with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), setting up a mutual attraction that can go either way. Former Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) is looking for Rey with the help of Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), another tough female role model in an increasingly woke franchise. One more near-spoiler to prove the point: During that opening battle the Resistance sends in bomber ships. All are destroyed except one. Its only surviving crew member pulling off a tense miracle, a heroic sacrifice, is a woman of color. Beyond that, her death isn't just a moment but continues to have meaning throughout the movie. That's woke. My biggest problem with The Last Jedi is literally small. Johnson capitulates to Disney franchise mechanics with the Porgs, pudgy seagulls of sorts inhabiting Luke's island. Not exactly Ewoks but too close for comfort. There's a gag about their edibility needing more bite and less Porg-eye cuteness. But plush toys must be sold, so... The rest of The Last Jedi is bolder than that, in its narrative direction and comedic urges. I'm fairly certain that a hardcore element of Comic Con types won't appreciate the flippancy given to previously stoic characters. Or the way Rey and Kylo Ren's psychic bond can sound like crushing teenagers text messaging. Kids'll dig it. If not, that's just one more way The Last Jedi surprises me.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," When we spoke with Andy Serkis several weeks back, he teased that fans of Star Wars wouldn’t be able to anticipate the twists and turns of The Last Jedi — the eighth episode in the ongoing saga. “I think they’re going to be very shocked at what they’re going to see,” said Serkis, who plays the evil leader of the First Order, Supreme Leader Snoke. Written and directed by Rian Johnson (Looper), this instalment (out Friday) is a richly plotted sequel that gives all of the new trilogy characters — Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and newcomer Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), among them — ample storylines, while allowing fans of George Lucas’ original trilogy a chance to reconnect with an older Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and  General Leia (the late, great Carrie Fisher). Picking up where 2015’s The Force Awakens left off, Johnson plops us right in the middle of a battle scene where Poe and other Resistance pilots are attempting to take out an enemy Dreadnaught craft belonging to the First Order. Right away, there’s Poe cracking jokes over the intercom to the over-the-top First Order leader General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson). It’s our first sign that Johnson is going to inject some humour into The Last Jedi. Then we are back on the deserted island cliff where Rey handed Luke the lightsaber at the end of Force Awakens. No spoilers, but Luke’s reaction to the gift is one Star Wars fans will love. Like the banter-filled scene between Poe and Hux before it, it lets us know that though there will be plenty of darkness throughout, Johnson is always looking to colour his scenes with moments of levity. The cast of The Last Jedi is pretty deep, but Johnson gives his narrative a chance to breathe. Like a masterful painting, every scene is carefully organized, with each piece of dialogue and all the bits of action deft brushstrokes on Johnson’s dazzling canvas. We get drawn out scenes with Luke and Rey on what turns out to be the Porg-filled island of Ahch-To. She’s there to learn more about the Jedi and to entice Luke to come help the Resistance defeat the evil Kylo Ren, who also happens to be Luke’s nephew. While on Ahch-To, Rey also discovers herself mentally linked to Kylo. She thinks maybe she can save him, while he thinks he can turn her to the dark side. Saying more than that will spoil the outcome. Luke, on the other hand, has turned to a hermit-like existence, bruised by his failure as a mentor and teacher (“I thought I could train Kylo,” Luke laments) and a loss of faith. It’s nice to see even the Star Wars universe get a sprinkling of the disappointments that tint our real-world lives. Meanwhile, after Finn recovers from his injuries sustained at the end of The Force Awakens, he teams up with Rose to track down a codebreaker that will help them infiltrate a First Order ship and disarm a tracking device. Then there’s Poe and his trusty sidekick BB-8 (again stealing almost every scene he’s in), who have to negotiate a power struggle with Vice-Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), a new addition to the series. Other old favourites, including R2-D2 (whose first meeting with Luke is heartwarming to see), C-3PO and Chewbacca are reintroduced.  Johnson also gives us a deeper look at the machinations of the mysterious First Order. We learn that Snoke tapped Kylo to be his apprentice because he saw the troubled youngster as “a new Vader.” But Snoke senses a struggle in Kylo — who killed father Han Solo in The Force Awakens — between the dark and the light. “You’re no Vader,” Snoke chides him. “Just a wild boy in a mask.” Has Snoke just been using Kylo as bait to lure Rey to the dark side? It’s a question fans who have seen the commercials have no doubt been asking themselves. But if there’s one niggling bit, it’s in some of Kylo’s scenes. He’s fighting an internal battle between good and evil, but there are moments where Driver’s overacting is almost distracting.  How all this comes to a head in the film’s second and third acts, is best experienced unspoiled. But one of my favourite new additions to the series gets introduced midway through — Benicio del Toro’s DJ. His character is one of those memorable secondary parts — like Boba Fett — that leaves a lasting impression and will have moviegoers thirsting for more. From a visual point of view, The Last Jedi has bright pops of colour — particularly in one scene that takes place in a casino and in the film’s final battle — and is a film that demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Johnson has packed a lot into his scenery and fans should give themselves a chance to let all that action wash over them. And like J.J. Abrams did before him with The Force Awakens, Johnson is trying to navigate a new world that will appeal to the next generation of Star Wars fans along with us oldsters. In this regard, the film is an unqualified success. You don’t have to be a Star Wars fan to love this addition to the canon (heck, it works even if you haven’t seen any of the other movies). The film doesn’t have the same cliff-hanger ending of Force Awakens, but The Last Jedi will certainly have you leaving the multiplex saying to yourself: ‘I can’t wait for what comes next.’ Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"In short, it feels like a new hope."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Two years ago we met Rey. She was a scavenger on a forgotten planet, eating gross bread, and dreaming of something beyond her depressing circumstances. That something came along, and Rey learned that she possessed a power she couldn't even begin to fathom (hint: it's The Force). Watching her come into her own in The Force Awakens was a revelation—annoying naysayers be damned—and now she's back in The Last Jedi, trying to understand what this innate gift means and how it relates to her past. Daisy Ridley's Rey was never the lone woman in the latest Star Wars trilogy, but in that movie, it still felt like she had to serve as the primary female representative among a gaggle of dude heroes. One of the copious joys of The Last Jedi is that's just not the case anymore. But it's Rey who's inner turmoil is important to this story. She's struggling to piece together how she fits in—all while the other rebels are being relentlessly attacked by the First Order—and is given a complete and complex arc, often removed from the action of the movie, yet implicitly tied to it. Rey's gratifying journey aside, let's be clear: The Last Jedi is fantastic. It's a constantly churning engine of wonder and excitement that grapples with elemental questions of good and evil that have always been the driving force of this universe. Director Rian Johnson has packed the film with inventive locales and endearing creatures. Yes, there are the much discussed porgs (see: that little dude above), but I unexpectedly fell in love with the fathiers, horse-type animals with sensitive faces and big ears. I could go on and on about all the beasts, but I'll spare you. Another magical quality The Last Jedi possesses? Here, women are the goddamn leaders. They're the people making the smart, considered, day-saving choices, while the men are often risky and foolish. The First Order's Kylo Ren and General Hux act like dictatorial toddlers, pouting when they don't get what they want. As for the Resistance, Poe Dameron and Finn have a tendency to confuse swashbuckling bravado for strategic decision making. In fact, in one of her first moments on screen, Leia chides Poe: ""Get your head out of your cockpit."" Yes, that is a dick joke. And speaking of, The Last Jedi is also perhaps the funniest Star Wars films ever. Take, for instance, the opening sequence, which manages to pack in genuine belly laughs (the screening audience was in a literal state of LOL), nail-biting action, and devastation. In doing all of that, the film neatly sets up a backstory for newcomer Kelly Marie Tran's Rose Tico—easily the most exciting addition to the franchise. While Rey and Finn became part of the Resistance almost by happenstance, Rose is a true believer in the cause to the extent that she's toiled away in the background as a mechanic while others have found glory. She's an example of how the conflict has resonance beyond what we're seeing play out on screen, and her presence adds a depth to the fight. Tran herself is also groundbreaking. Never before has an Asian-American woman been a protagonist in these films, and she breaks the spate of white brunettes who have been cast as heroines. She plays Rose with an effusiveness that doesn't surmount her resolve or her sorrow. Another new lady who is not here for any crap is Laura Dern's purple-haired Vice Admiral Holdo. I won't reveal too much about the effortlessly glamorous military mind, but let's just say she is not to be underestimated. That's actually a good rule of thumb for all of these women, Leia, of course, included. Carrie Fisher's untimely death is now inexorably linked with Leia, but The Last Jedi doesn't give too overt a nod to the real world tragedy that will shape the future of this saga. Seeing Carrie Fisher as the princess-turned-general one last time is inherently moving, and certain images will of course make you feel her loss particularly strongly. But, most of the time, Fisher's performance is so sparkling that's it's hard to imagine she's actually gone. As the general, she's revered and regal, but not lacking her saucy wit. (Leia knows exactly what she's doing when she delivers that ""cockpit"" joke. Fisher certainly did.) At one point Finn says, ""People believe in Leia."" It's a line that works just as well out of context as it does during the scene. People have always believed in Leia and they always will, even with Fisher gone. And with the likes of Rey and Rose in the mix, it's clear that her legacy in the galaxy far far away will not be forgotten.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," HAVING restored balance to the cinematic force that is Star Wars at its best with JJ Abrams’ The Force Awakens two years ago, Rian Johnson now looks to take things further with the eighth episode in the saga, The Last Jedi. The result is a film played out on the grandest of scales, that confidently encapsulates the best Star Wars traits while also expanding its horizons. The Last Jedi is fresher and more forward thinking than Abrams’ predecessor, opening up intriguing new possibilities and bringing in interesting new characters. It’s very much a changing of the guard. Johnson, as he has previously shown when handling episodes of Breaking Bad, knows how to enter into a franchise and honour its legacy, while creating something distinct in his own right. Hence, The Last Jedi has plenty of surprises up its sleeve, whether stylistically in its surprising [and frequent] use of humour, or in terms of some of the plot ‘twists’ it delivers. It still retains the darkness inherent in franchise standard-bearer The Empire Strikes Back, but it doesn’t exist to go through the same motions. Johnson, a self-confessed childhood fan, knows what is expected of a Star Wars entry and deploys the iconography well. There are nods to past creations and sequences, as well as one or two surprise cameos. But he is also acutely aware of the need to keep things fresh, to usher in a generation of new heroes and villains capable of carrying Disney and Lucasfilm’s vision forward for future generations of cinema-goers. And he frequently does so with aplomb. The film picks up in the immediate aftermath of The Force Awakens as the Resistance, led by General Leia (the late Carrie Fisher) and fellow heroes Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega), are relentlessly pursued by First Order Star Destroyers intent on ending their rebellion once and for all. It’s eventually left to Finn and newcomer Rose Tico (a fellow soldier played by Kelly Marie Tran) to embark on their own mission aimed at thwarting this. Rey (Daisy Ridley), meanwhile, has found Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) on a remote island and persuaded him, albeit reluctantly, to train her in the ways of The Force â a task that unsettles him once he begins to realise the true extent of her powers. And then there’s Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), still coming to terms with his own destiny, who comes to view Rey as an unlikely ally who could tip the balance of power in his favour, if he can prove his worth to Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). With so many characters and so much plot to squeeze in, it’s perhaps unsurprising that The Last Jedi is officially the longest film in Star Wars history so far (clocking in at just over two and a half hours). But Johnson, who also penned the screenplay, works hard to ensure that the film maintains a breathless energy, if not always managing to do justice to every single character. Where he does, though, the actors and the emotional investment benefit. Hamill’s Luke Skywalker, now a man struggling with his own legend and the toll it has taken on him and those around him, is brilliantly realised, providing Hamill with his best work to date. While the continued struggles of both Ridley’s Rey and Driver’s Ren are nicely realised, giving both stars plenty to work with as they gain a deeper appreciation of their [possibly linked] fate. One of the criticisms, however, does extend to the Kylo Ren character, who has still yet to attain the Darth Vader-style status that his initial appearance seemed to suggest. But that’s more down to the writing than Driver’s portrayal of him. Of the supporting cast, newcomers such as Tran, Benicio Del Toro (as a thief) and Laura Dern (as a Resistance general) impress, while returning characters such as Isaac’s ‘trigger happy’ pilot Poe and Serkis’s villain Snoke (delivered via more performance capture) also get plenty of moments to savour. In terms of spectacle, The Last Jedi demands to be seen (and heard) on the biggest screen possible. Johnson injects the film with a wow factor befitting its status as a cinematic giant. The battles are big, long and always spectacular, whether being conducted atop a planet surface awash with whites and reds, or in the midst of outer space where one explosion, quite literally, illuminates the screen without so much as a hint of sound. It’s one of several bravura moments. As if to underline the confidence that the film has in its own ambition, Johnson is also keen to widen the universe, taking us to planets never previously visited and showing us characters and creatures that have never before been tasted. One planet, in particular, offers up a den of gambling and other illicit activities that is alive with invention and possibility. Indeed, with so much going for it, The Last Jedi comes mighty close to being the best Star Wars entry yet. But – and it’s a relatively small one – there are moments when it stumbles. I felt the film could have benefitted from a more cynical streak, befitting The Empire Strikes Back, instead of the sometimes cheesy optimism it deploys throughout (in the face of a lot of darkness). While some of the revelations it teases (a la Empire) ultimately fail to pay off as big as you’d expect. But in the main, Johnson has delivered the goods: a film that isn’t afraid to be ambitious, that delights and dazzles in equal measure, while providing a worthwhile emotional investment. It is a crowd-pleaser that will be wholeheartedly embraced by fans."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," The latest “Star Wars” entry is nowhere near the digitized debacle of the first two prequels. Still, coming off 2015’s effective reboot and the stellar “Rogue One” “The Last Jedi” is a disappointment. There’s worse news for right-of-center movie fans. The film stops cold to sling some stale talking points against the rich. That’s something the franchise has avoided for decades — tapping a progressive meme instead of focusing on the elemental themes that made the saga so potent. The moment doesn’t kill the movie. Not in the least. It’s still one of several signs writer/director Rian Johnson was the wrong man to steer the series. Heroic Rey (Daisy Ridley, growing beautifully into the role) has finally found Luke Skywalker, but recruiting him to fight the First Order won’t be easy. He’s disillusioned with both The Force and his role in leading Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) to the Dark Side. The First Order knows the rebels’ location. A battalion of Star Destroyers is on their tail, and the ragtag fleet’s fuel is running out. Good thing Finn (John Boyega) and his new pal Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) have a plan to save the day. Only it’ll take plenty of screen time while dragging the franchise into the culture wars … where it most certainly doesn’t belong. Johnson’s screenplay bounces between silly laugh lines and expository drivel. “Quick, we have to [fill in the blank] in order to [fill in another blank].” The formula gets tired after the first hour, and there’s still so much time left to reuse and recycle it. The story is essentially the rebellion hiding in one place, getting caught, and then finding another spot to hide. Johnson drops plenty of cutesy comic moments into the mix, some of which would make even George Lucas blush. What was passable in 1977 no longer flies as easily today. And a franchise as esteemed as this one deserves richer comic relief. Johnson’s script has other issues. He occasionally withholds crucial information from the audience for a big reveal later. The technique will make you groan, not cheer. One such moment is such a staggering plot hole you could fill it with a hundred Death Stars. Narrative arcs offering real meat wither with misuse. Rey and the Kylo Ren connect in intriguing ways, both thematically and visually. Their bond gets jettisoned for the noisy third act. The franchise’s new PC directives are front and center once more. Female leaders repeatedly dress down male heroes. Every other fighter pilot is a woman or person of color. It’s in your face …. and totally acceptable had the film soared like “The Force Awakens.” You can see the PC mindset with Rose, an Asian heroine played by Kelly Marie Tran. She’s plucky… and that’s about as far as her character development goes. “Rogue One” offered a similarly diverse group of heroes, but many stood out thanks to the performances and script. That’s not often the case here beyond a savvy Laura Dern as a Rebel commander. Meanwhile, both Rose and the villainous Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) leave little impression. Rose’s character is front and center in the film’s weakest sequences. We’re diverted to a city where the worst of the worst frolic. No, not the usual hives of scum and villainy. It’s a casino where the very, very rich cavort. If you’re not immediately yanked out of the story here you deserve a prize. The accompanying dialogue is equally clunky, as is the reason all these vapid souls gained their fortunes. The “Star Wars” saga has always focused exclusively on good versus evil, a timeless template that helped forge its place in our lives. Not anymore. “The Last Jedi” offers up some old friends (no spoilers here) with mixed results. Other connections prove more fortuitous. Johnson shrewdly adopts director J.J. Abrams’ blend of CGI and old school effects from “The Force Awakens.” John Williams’ score punches the clock in the best of ways, although it’s too soon to know if any new arrangements will become iconic. “Return of the Jedi” caught heat for its cutesy supporting players. Clearly Team Disney didn’t learn that lesson or demanded a cuddly toy line for Christmases to come. The Porg creatures are amusing for all of five seconds. Those Ewoks deserve a cookie bouquet from cultural critics over the past 30-odd years of grief. And then there’s Luke Skywalker. Mark Hamill is older, wiser and always compelling as the character that shaped his career. He’s not a hero but a bitter old man unwilling to leverage the Force as he once did. His arc is fascinating, and a fine use of a classic character bridging the chasm between the old and new films. “The Last Jedi” often looks gorgeous in a way that lapses the usual CGI wizardry. A battle sequence set on a salt-covered planet, where the heroes and villains leave a blood colored trail in the sand, is stunning. Other sequences astound, like a sneak attack from a certain Jedi and a light saber fight with a nasty finale. For every shining moment comes a dud, and the ratio doesn’t flatter the film’s frantic third act. The story itself? It’s intermittently beautiful, too. Too bad the blemishes come early and often enough to ding a precious part of our pop culture landscape. HiT or Miss: No critical warning will stop fans from seeing “Star Wars: The Last Jedi.” Just know the eight film in the saga isn’t what we hoped it could be. If Chewie has just chomped the head right off that pullet and made all the kiddies squeal, I could have been dragged on one bleeding fingernail to like a tiny part of this thoroughly rotten and ethically contemptible movie shot through with Marxist cultural-warfare identity politics. (When Rose wakes up, she can choke on her quasi-Islamic crescent moon pendant. They try to disguise it by making it round on the bottom, but they’re not fooling me or anyone else paying attention to how Kathleen Kennedy’s Red Hollywood does things.) What the Fuck have you been smoking? the movie was terrible but to pull PC liberal bullshit out of it is next level paranoia. I did’nt see anything evil about the casino. it was just a bunch of rich people gambling.  it must suck to watch a movie and waiting to be offended. you have a sad little life. One thing I want to note – die hard Star Wars fans do not like this film, and it has nothing to do with the PC crap. Lots of complaints about story elements that don’t pay off, the butchering of Luke Skywalker’s character, and other stuff that would be too spoiler-ish. I hope the next installment gets a better writer. This one was a bladder buster. What is it about showing spoiled, self-centered rich people acting like spoiled, self-centered rich people that immediately triggers a snowflake reaction? This wasn’t about the the 1%, these folks were clearly identified as war profiteers without any particular ideology other than to get rich by selling to whoever pays. News flash–people like that exist. I can’t wait for the review of “It’s a Wonderful Life” where you say liberal Hollywood is biased against good old Mr. Potter and his bank. There are certainly fights involving light sabers. Light sabers get used in battle. They slice people and things apart. They look cool, they sound cool.  This will be the first Star Wars flick I will not bother to see. Thanks for the heads-up on the PC crap foisted on an impressionable viewership. Most won’t even notice. This has become a Hollywood infection that makes most of their output unwatchable for me and many others who just want to be entertained. you’re not going to see it because this guy said it’s too PC?  why not judge for yourself?  the salt planet battle scene is quite epic.  i’m glad the underdeveloped character roles were given to non caucasian actors.  they would have been just as terribly written no matter who played them.  but don’t you get tired of looking at only white people all the time?  i don’t see this casting as a PC move; it is the reality of our world.  black people exist.  asian people exist.  i see them everyday.  don’t you think they want to see themselves too? Going to the movies costs a whole lot of money. Why spend a bunch of money if you’re not sure you’re going to at least sorta enjoy the movie? A couple of bucks at Redbox seems much more reasonable for movies you might not like. that’s a very sensible reply : )  you’re right, not everything is big screen worthy.  at the theatre i saw the movie in, they were charging 24.99 for the Star Wars popcorn bucket.  that put a bad taste in my mouth.  but, the good scenes do look really nice on the big screen. SJW plot? You’re intentionally injecting your own political hang ups into the movie randomly. Like the author of this wildly contrarian “review” did. You’re seeing what you wan to see, this never actually happened. Actually I was talking more about Star Wars Clone Wars.  If you never watched Clone Wars as compared to Rebels (where a lot of cannon is established or confirmed from the books) then you know not what I am talking about.  Clone Wars did not have Disney controlling it and that is why it was so popular and more adult focused.  Star War Rebels is okay, but way more aimed at the younger audience.  Today’s Star Wars has about as much grit as Muppets.  Do you need examples? I confess I started watching “Rebels” before “Clone Wars” and the latter does have that Disney-family vibe wereas “Clone Wars” is darker and more graphic on-screen. Nevertheless, “Rebels” has some moments that could scare the kids (e.g. Kanan getting blinded by Maul) and in season 3 the stakes are higher when Grand Admiral Thrawn joins the show. For a “family-friendly” show I have found some conservative themes in “Rebels” when it comes to family values and mentor-student relationships. You have individuals torn apart by war but coming together to create a surrogate family with Kanan as the father-figure and Hera as the mother. Sabine Wren starts off as a seemingly carefree graffiti-artist but instead of hating her biological family forever, she matures and faces them to correct past errors. Ezra Bridger wears his heart on his sleeve and wants to do the right thing but learns honorable intentions doesn’t always lead to positive results. He definitely needs a guiding hand as he’s tempted by the likes of Maul. Kanan Jarrus could wallow in pity about being blinded but he crawls out of his darkness and goes back to mentoring Ezra. Give me a break.
Or the laughable concept of arms dealers making both x-wings and tie fighters, which shits all over Star Wars lore just for the sake of making a progressive talking point."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Writer-director Rian Johnson goes for broke in the latest installment of the “Star Wars” franchise, and he delivers an epic space opera with “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” a film that is as indebted to the previous installments and “Star Wars” canon as it is to classic Westerns, sword-and-sandal epics and martial arts films. After this impressive showing, it’s no wonder producer Kathleen Kennedy has hired Johnson to make a trilogy of “Star Wars” films with a whole new cast of characters. But first, in classic nonlinear “Star Wars” fashion, arrives “Episode VIII.” Picking up where “The Force Awakens” left off, “The Last Jedi” reunites audiences with the host of new characters they fell in love with two years ago. Poe (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), Rey (Daisy Ridley) and BB-8 are back and still fighting in the Resistance against the First Order, led by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) and prodigal Solo son Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Our heroes are scattered to the wind. Rey has been dispatched to an isolated planet to recruit Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to the cause, while hotshot flyboy Poe tangles with the pecking order of Resistance leadership. Finn and a new ally, Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), have their own secret mission they’re undertaking to protect the Resistance fighters who are being chased all over the galaxy by the First Order. “The Last Jedi” is a sweeping and grandiose film, and it’s also far funnier than any other “Star Wars” film has attempted to be. Johnson pitches the tone just right, with actual jokes and visual gags peppered amongst the stunning action set pieces, as well as earnest and emotionally moving moments of heroism and self-sacrifice. Johnson leaves it all on the screen: Everything you could want and more from a “Star Wars” film can be found in “The Last Jedi.” There are cute and mysterious creatures (the porgs will rule us all), gripping action sequences and fight choreography, a wacky party scene, spiritual discussions of the Force and what it means to be a Jedi and, most important, a group of heroes who know they will persevere if they save what they love, not destroy what they hate. That desire to do it all and more in “The Last Jedi” does come with its drawbacks. The movie is overstuffed with plot, and by the time the visually intoxicating and eye-popping last showdown happens, it feels like a set piece that should have been saved for the next film. At a whopping two hours and 32 minutes, “The Last Jedi” overstays its welcome just a tad. Even though this “Star Wars” outing has a fresh and unique visual style and lovable new characters, it’s a film that ultimately pays beautiful tribute to the people who first made us fall in love with the franchise: Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher. Hamill is at a career best — and steals the film — as the legendary Jedi Luke, while Fisher’s Leia receives a fitting finale. It’s the blend of reverence for its roots and embrace of the new that makes “The Last Jedi” a triumph."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Within the first 15 minutes, I cried and laughed, and then did so again a few times, with some gasps in between. Writer/director Rian Johnson (“Brick,” “Looper”) has brought his considerable skill and obvious deep affection for the “Star Wars” universe to this latest chapter, “The Last Jedi.” I won’t make the obvious Force reference; I’ll just say that he has produced a film that longtime fans will find very satisfying, with a stunning black, white, and red color pallette, thrilling adventure, appealing new characters and worthy developments for old friends, including characters from the first movie (fourth chapter), and a cause to root for. After the now-traditional opening crawl (basically: the rebellion is not doing very well against the First Order), we have the traditional beginning, right in the middle of the action. As with “The Force Awakens,” we see the I-even-rebel-against-rebels Poe Dameron (dashing Oscar Isaac) in his tiny X-Wing, taking on First Order General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) with not much by way of firepower, but enormous skill and endless amounts pure pleasure in messing with him. Hux spouts off pompous, pretentious threats about how many different ways he is going to destroy the rebellion, and Poe just trolls him while the rebels gear up for their traditional-but-never-old trick of being quick and cunning instead of enormous and cumbersome. And we’re off — in three different directions, as Johnson weaves back and forth, with gorgeously cinematic segues recalling “Lawrence of Arabia’s” match flame to the desert. Finn (John Boyega) and a new character, Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) go off in search of a code-breaker who, according to Maz (voiced by Lupita Nyong’o) is the only one who can help them get on board the place they have to go to turn off the tracking device (callback to Episode 4, where if the old man didn’t get the tractor beam out of commission it was going to be a real short trip). Meanwhile, as we saw in the last shot of the previous chapter, Rey (Daisy Ridley) has found Luke Skywalker (a majestic Mark Hamill, evoking both the farm boy turned Jedi he was in episodes IV-VI and his mentors Obi-wan Kenobi and Yoda as well). Like Leia (Carrie Fisher) in the first film, she tells him she needs his help (R2-D2 tells him, too). But he does not want to be involved any more, as fighter or teacher. And she is being contacted by a sort of Force version of Skype, by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). In the last film, they fought with lightsabers in the snow. In this chapter, their conflict is more subtle, more personal. And the rebel forces led by General Leia are being pushed back, with many casualties. This is a movie where more than one character makes the ultimate sacrifice. And more than one gets a last-minute rescue. The settings are captivating, including a pleasure planet with an elaborate casino for the galaxy’s one percenters and some important lessons about both sides-ism and Balzac’s notion that behind every great fortune is a crime. And there is a salt-based planet with animals that look like foxes made from shards of glass. Chewie makes a heart-meltingly cute new friend. Refreshingly, female and non-white characters play dominant roles on both sides. And, there is a possibility of another New Hope. The rebel forces — and the Star Wars stories — are in good hands. Parents should know that this is a sci-fi action film with extended peril and violence and some disturbing images. Characters are injured and killed, there is some mild language, some alcohol, and a kiss."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"  Star Wars fans, your sky high expectations are rewarded. If possible, stoke your enthusiasm even further. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a torrent of plot development. What you've pontificated, argued, and theorized about, is going to be shattered utterly. Rian Johnson takes the fabled lore from a galaxy far away into uncharted territory. He will have you spellbound. It's a lot to comprehend at first blush, and there are a few down beats. The film is so packed with narrative, it doesn't flow quite as effortlessly as Empire Strikes Back or Rogue One; but where it takes you is remarkable.   As the First Order marches to finish the Resistance, every character in The Last Jedi is faced with a reckoning. A hero's journey does not take place without introspection. The search for answers sometimes leads to uncomfortable truths. Rey (Daisy Ridley) has found Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), but he is not at all the teacher she expected. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) killed his father to become more powerful in the dark side. His heinous act further driving the conflict within him. While Snoke (Andy Serkis) and General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) sense victory, General Organa (Carrie Fisher) understands the importance of hope. Her officers (Oscar Isaac, Laura Dern) may differ on tactics, but the Resistance can always depend on the iron will of its fighters (John Boyega, Kelly Tran) and droids.   The Last Jedi cuts no corners. Its greatest accomplishment is successfully managing the myriad of complex storylines. Heroes and villains have character arcs that are brewed like Star Wars tea. Their outcomes are seismic. Some scenes will floor you with astonishment. Rian Johnson challenges convention early and often. The genius of his approach is a firm foundation in the mythology; with, dare I say an enlightened take on its future. The Force Awakens was quite similar to A New Hope in plot and structure. The Last Jedi cannot be quantified as The Empire Strikes Back of this trilogy. What happens, where the characters go, and the impact of the climax stands resolutely on its own.   The Last Jedi has stupendously dramatic moments, but offsets the heaviness with sprinkles of sharp humor. These scenes have a decidedly more youthful manner indicative of the director. It helps to manage the staggering carnage. The battle scenes are epic in scope with casualties galore. Star Wars, as established in Rogue One, has taken the kids gloves off in its depiction of violence. War is hell and losses are real. The visual and sound effects deliver the sci-fi blows like a jackhammer. The lightsaber duels aren't as intricate as the Lucas films, but are equally titanic in their resolve. There are two mind-blowing fight scenes that will have fans frothing at the bit for months.   The film does have a primary flaw. The flood of reveals and character exposition leads to choppiness. Johnson has so much to tell us, so much to do; it doesn't all stitch together seamlessly. The Last Jedi tends to swing from jaw-dropping moments. The scenes in between are critical to the story, but feel distinctly less in gravitas. This issue is addressed rather poignantly in the close, when the future path of the Star Wars story is finally laid out.   The performances in The Last Jedi will be immensely rewarding to the fan base. Mark Hamill will have you cheering again for Luke Skywalker. He has changed significantly since Return of the Jedi, but is still the embodiment of the mythic hero. I was mesmerized by Mark Hamill here, just like I was as a child. He and Rian Johnson have succeeded in bringing the wonder of Luke Skywalker to a whole new generation. If you thought he was bad-ass before...   The Last Jedi has deeply philosophical moments. It takes the battle between light and darkness to a whole new place. The film is truly one surprise after the other. I can't wait to hear what audiences think once all of the secrets are in the open. Lucasfilm has possibly made the most discussion worthy installment of Star Wars. Spoilers will ruin the experience, so tread carefully. And yes, the Porgs are freaking adorable.  Julian Roman has been with Movieweb for twenty years. An avid film buff, he watches nearly 200 films a year across every genre. He feels lucky to have interviewed and written extensively about Hollywood's greatest talents. In his spare time he plays guitar, treasures good company, and always seeks new adventures. Tim Blake Nelson may have a big role in next year's Captain America 4, but he could have also been part of this year's epic Dune sequel. "
"Dec 12, 2017",NEGATIVE," There’s a scene in the middle of “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” that’s so
mysterious, inspired, rich in overtones, and tenuously attached to the
movie surrounding it that it virtually shouts its presence as the writer
and director Rian Johnson’s embedded showreel, his flourish of personal
purpose and creative power amid the two and a half wearying hours that
serve as its frame. It’s part of a sequence that takes place in a
neo-medieval island hideout where Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has long
been sulking (shades of Achilles in the Iliad). Rey (Daisy Ridley), one
of the new generation of heroes introduced in “The Force
Awakens,” in 2015, goes to that forbidding, rocky, windswept retreat in the hope
of persuading Luke to come back and join her and the other heroes in the
Resistance to the First Order—to which the son of Han and Leia, Ben
Solo, now known as Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) has sworn fealty. While visiting Luke, Rey drops out of his sight for a moment and enters
a hidden place in which she faces a vast subterranean mirrored curtain.
She beholds her own reflection, reaches out to it, and sees it multiply.
Suddenly, there’s a dozen or more identical Reys, all moving in unison,
but then moving not in unison but in sequence, as if choreographed as a
one-woman crowd in a Busby Berkeley production number, snapping her
fingers and chanting a line or two, echoing outward toward an endless
chorus line of Reys that seemingly recedes to infinity. The sequence is a major inspiration, a moment of conscience and
solitude, which wrenches itself out of the Star Wars cinematic universe
to become a symbolic experience of independent power. That’s the good
news. Yes, the question of Rey’s identity, of her own sense of it, is
ultimately applied to the movie’s plot. The bad news is that it’s stuck
onto it, inconsequentially, to add a nub of psychological conflict; like
so much else in the movie, it’s a conspicuously crafted, compulsory
detail to stoke a preprogrammed response in viewers. Like
most of the movie’s twists and details, it provokes the feeling of
subjection to stimuli like a movie-theatre lab rat. The rest of the story (which I won’t spoil) involves the attempt by the
Resistance, led by General Leia (the late Carrie Fisher, in her last
role) to survive and escape an onslaught by the First Order that’s led
by the haughty General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) and its Supreme Leader
Snoke (Andy Serkis). It also involves matters of strategy as it meshes
with temperament—and with gender difference—in the intrepid combat of
the pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). Two other Resistance fighters, Finn
(John Boyega) and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), are also in the forefront of
battle, as is another officer (Laura Dern). The movie brings back
beloved characters; it features a varied array of excellent actors, even
some of the best of the time. Johnson is an auteur of sorts, one whose talent is ready-made for a
generation of critics desperate to have one who works in popular genres
and achieves popular successes, for fear that their enthusiasm for
individual inspiration will isolate them from the celebrity circus of
mass-market movies. He’s like Christopher Nolan but better, the other
side of Nolan’s showily dour Janus-face. Unlike Nolan, Johnson has an
authentically enticing virtuosity, joining a sense of vision to a sense
of glee. But “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” yokes Johnson’s formidable
cinematic intelligence to an elaborate feat of fan service that feels,
above all, like the rhetorical and dramatic gratification of a religious
sect. And what’s all the more disturbing about the experience is
that—unlike inspired preachers whose own sense of fervor and possession
threatens to run away with them, puts them into a public state of
exaltation that they communicate to their flock—Johnson remains stolid,
intelligent, in deft command. He leads, in “The Last Jedi,” not by
example but from behind the curtain. In particular, he lets his writing—or, rather, his plotting—take
control of him. It doesn’t run away with him (as in his 2012 movie,
“Looper”), but, rather, it dominates him, both technically and
emotionally. Throughout “The Last Jedi,” twist after twist, touch after
touch, line after line has the feel of the compulsory, of homework done
elaborately, with extreme labor. Johnson’s sense of fun flicks out only
in a few moments when heroic feats come off with a quick gleam and a
quiet awe, when a tossed-off line of dialogue tweaks a tense situation
with only mildly forced humor. Even the extraordinary cast members have
less room here than in “The Force Awakens” to let their personalities
show; the movie’s cinematic fabric is cut too tight, the frame is too
constraining, the story lines hold them stiff and still like so many guy
wires. (Fisher, however, manages to stand out and apart, like James
Mason in Joseph Mankiewicz’s “Julius Caesar,” merely by talking.) Despite a few stunning decorative touches (most of which involve the color red) and that brief central sequence of multiple Reys, the movie comes off as a work that’s ironed out, flattened down, appallingly purified. Above all, it delivers a terrifyingly calculated consensus storytelling, an artificial universality that is achieved, in part, through express religious references. (I won’t give away the Biblical ones, but they’re conspicuous, including an Abrahamic one, a New Testament one, and some skillfully placed crosses.) I desperately miss the pseudo-Shakespearean dialectical wrangles and the exhilarating sense of C.G.I. discoveries that mark George Lucas’s last forays into the franchise—their sense of renewed personal investment in a cinematic universe that seemed to be growing ever more complex before its creator’s eyes, their sense that its creator was personally wrestling with a world that was escaping his own control and taking on a life of its own. Now, in “The Last Jedi,” that world has been tamed, tamped down, boxed
in, neatly packaged, to a chilling extreme. It fixes its heroes in an
abstemious, militarized world of twenty-four-hour-a-day work for mere
survival, in which no personal life remains outside the realm of
official function, a de-mentalized world that the movie presents,
moreover, as appealing. If there’s any artistic unconscious or second
level to “The Last Jedi,” it’s in a recurring plot point involving the
very notion of mind control. And if there’s a sense of ego built into
the movie, it’s with the built-in certainty that its maker and its
viewers are on the right side of things. Lockstep consensus is
cultivated not with chewily carnivorous troglodytes flaunting wanton
violence and cruel spews of gore but with purpose and virtue, devotion
and tradition, in the unimpeachable and unexceptionable name of
liberation. “The Last Jedi” is a story about the Resistance, but the film
itself is a cinematic masterwork of the First Order. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement. This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Neither the Walt Disney Company nor the Royal Family, a pair of institutions that in some ways have much in common, are willing to confirm rumours that two of the armour-shrouded stormtroopers in Star Wars: The Last Jedi are in fact Prince William and Prince Harry. But, if they are, the princes have chosen their silver-screen debuts wisely. This film, the ninth with Star Wars in the title since George Lucas’s original 1977 movie, is one of the most accomplished blockbusters I have seen for years; bold in conception, spectacular in realisation, but also chock-full of genuine wit, philosophical depth, and stirring poignancy. It was a masterstroke to hand the directorial reins to Rian Johnson, a self-confessed Star Wars nut raised in California who has also written the script and filled it with clever references to all those previous films he knows so well. But just as the cast profile straddles the Atlantic, with Britain’s John Boyega and Daisy Ridley playing opposite the likes of American actors Mark Hamill and Adam Driver, so too was there plenty of British wizardry behind the scenes. The technical effects team at Pinewood Studios has wrought absolute wonders. Not everything can be controlled, however, and not all of the film’s poignancy was intentional. A concluding caption pays tribute to ‘our princess’ Carrie Fisher, who over 40 years has metamorphosed into the venerable General Leia Organa, and who died after filming had been completed. How sad she is not around to take part in the publicity tour; she was always such fun on chat-show sofas. In truth, it takes a very long time to get from the film’s exhilarating start to that moving sign-off. Stars Wars: The Last Jedi lasts fully two-and-a-half hours, and there were moments towards the end when I felt like one of those poor Cubans listening to Fidel Castro at the height of his oratorical vigour: just as you’re planning your route to the exit, it lurches into yet another new lease of life. But, my goodness, how it rewards the audience’s staying power. Han Solo is dead, killed by his and Leia’s son Kylo Ren (Driver), and the villainous First Order’s ineffably evil, incomparably ugly Supreme Leader Snoke (a mercifully unrecognisable Andy Serkis) is determined to finish off the noble Resistance, led by a resolute, but ageing and vulnerable Leia. The Last Jedi skilfully continues the handover of the Star Wars baton to a younger generation. Snoke has the dastardly but comically hapless General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) to do his dirty work for him, facilitating some cheap but welcome laughs. Yet there is little comedy from Snoke’s other instrument of evil, the emotionally conflicted Ren. Driver again makes a fantastic baddie, a worthy successor to Darth Vader, investing his character with proper depth. He’s the kind of tortured soul, tugged one way by conscience and another by impulse, who would grace any psychological thriller. If I had to find a spoonful of negativity to splash on such a cinematic feast, it would be that Ridley, as the space scavenger Rey, is outclassed in her scenes with Driver and the equally terrific Hamill. She’s jolly pretty, and wields a light sabre wonderfully, but her dramatic range still stretches only from A to just beyond B. Happily, Hamill gets a gratifying amount of screen time as Leia’s elusive twin, the disillusioned Luke Skywalker, looking in his oilskin coat like a lonely old Norwegian fisherman. He is swaddled in self-imposed exile and existential gloom on a remote, jagged island, supposedly the most ‘unfindable place in the galaxy’. In reality, it’s a rocky outcrop just off the coast of Ireland. Nevertheless, Luke is still a Jedi knight, quite possibly the last one in existence, and Rey needs him to teach her the secrets of the Force. Will he be tempted out of retirement? Even without him, the beleaguered Resistance, rapidly running out of both fuel and ideas, can muster some impressive assets, among them the apostate stormtrooper Finn (Boyega) and his unlikely new sidekick, a doughty janitor called Rose (Kelly Marie Tran). In fine Star Wars tradition, there is also some splendid droid action, and a collection of weird and wonderful new animals that might have escaped from last year’s Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them. Meanwhile, maverick pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is a further thorn in the First Order’s side, though he’s almost as much of a handful for his own side, especially Leia’s second-in-command, Vice-Admiral Amilyn Holdo, played by a stern Laura Dern, sporting a fetching mauve hairdo that makes her look for all the world like an inter-galactic Mrs Slocombe, from Are You Being Served?. In our seats at an IMAX screening earlier this week (do see this film on the biggest screen available) we were certainly being served. A glorious episode in a casino looks like the realisation of a feverish dream surreally fusing James Bond with Dr Dolittle, and there’s also a scene-stealing turn from a rascally Benicio del Toro, who has surely booked himself a place in the next instalment. It was great fun, too, spotting a few fleeting cameos, from Adrian Edmondson and Lily Cole among others. But all this is underpinned by some genuinely profound philosophising about life and death, including a line about the way to win being more about saving those you love than killing those you hate, that felt almost too deep for Star Wars. Ever since The Force Awakens ended on a cliffhanger — on a cliff — two years ago I’ve been dying to see what will happen next. Starting practically where the last one ended, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), now old and in hiding, must train Rey (Daisy Ridley) to become a Jedi and help fight the First Order, led by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). The trailers didn’t show much, so almost everything was surprising. The first part of the movie was (dare I say it) a bit slow, and I was getting a bit impatient to find out about Rey and see if Luke would turn to the dark side or not, but it was still really interesting. We also got to see some new faces, such as resistance engineer Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), Benicio del Toro’s mystery character, the beautiful crystal foxes and the penguin-like Porgs. There was way more of Poe (Oscar Isaac), and Finn has an epic fight with Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie), which was quite like the Finn vs Stormtrooper fight from The Force Awakens. The more you think about it, the more you notice the corny. But none of that matters because it’s Star Wars — a story about religious space wizards with laser swords. This movie explores the idea of the grey area between good and evil, and I loved that — it made it more unpredictable and you didn’t know where it would go next. The film started with a joke, and had plenty more throughout, but some of them seemed a little out of place. That’s what Marvel does a lot. You can’t have serious, serious all the time if you want to attract the kids. Maybe it was because there wasn’t a main funny guy like Han Solo, and it was sad to see Chewie and the Millennium Falcon without him. In the IMAX, the film looked spectacular. The scenes on Crait with the red soil hidden under a layer of white salt was very smart since it looked like the planet was bleeding, and the choreography of some of the fight scenes was stunning. Red is a very big theme in this film. Even the logo on the posters was red — and so were Snoke’s intimidating Praetorian guards. I wouldn’t like to pick a fight with them and their semi kyber Crystal, not-quite-light saber weapons."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," That unaffected character has greatly diminished over the years, and is now almost completely gone.  The new “Star Wars” movies are skillfully made, recycling elements that made the first two pictures in particular so winning and offering a cornucopia of action, battles and thrills (much of them CGI-based), along with an obligatory dose of juvenile humor.  But the recipe has taken on a mechanical feel, and because of the sensory cascade it has grown increasingly exhausting rather than exhilarating.  There is a point where giving audiences too much of what you think they crave has diminishing returns.  The aim of the makers now appears to be the same as that of the heroic characters in the movie—survival. That isn’t to say that fans of the franchise—and even casual viewers—won’t enjoy “The Last Jedi,” as this latest installment is subtitled.  But even the most dedicated devotee probably won’t feel transported by it, as they were by that first trip to a galaxy far, far away four decades ago.  One now reacts dutifully rather than enthusiastically; as with the movies of the so-called Marvel Universe, what you’re likely to appreciate is the familiarity of it all—you feel comfortably at home with what’s transpiring onscreen because, basically, you know what’s coming.  But the freshness is gone. It isn’t that writer-director Rian Johnson doesn’t toss a few curves into the plot of this sequel to the modified remake of “A New Hope” with which J.J. Abrams rebooted the series in 2015.  Introducing new characters who essentially went through a slightly altered version of the story arc that Luke, Leia and Han completed the first time around, Abrams’ movie acted as a farewell to Solo, and this one is a similar send-off for Luke.  Only Leia survives—at least corporeally—at the end, presumably to have her swan song in the upcoming third part of the “reboot (or “Skywalkers’ End”) trilogy,” though one imagines that Carrie Fisher’s death will require some serious rethinking to end matters properly now. All of this is done up with every bit of polish that the Disney balance-sheet can muster.  The effects are top-drawer, and while no one among the younger performers is especially charismatic, they all do what is demanded of them well enough.  Most interest, however, will probably concentrate on the oldsters.  Fisher provides a maternal presence but not much more.  Though absent for long stretches, it’s Hamill who dominates as a sort of Obi-wan redux, and it must be said that while he’s adequate, he lacks either the gravitas or the mischievous twinkle in the eye that Alec Guinness brought to the first film, though he tries for both.  Rich Heinrich’s production design and Steve Yedin’s cinematography are aces, and John Williams continues the tradition of his rousing background scores.  Editor Bob Ducsay moves the individual sequences along with dispatch; it isn’t his fault that at two-and-a-half hours the movie overstays its welcome.  That’s the fault of Johnson’s decision to pile climax upon climax as if they were on sale at Screenplays-R-Us, apparently unwilling to jettison any of the ideas he’s had for propelling the story forward."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," A critical assessment of the merits of a subject, such as art, film, music, television, food and literature. Reviews are based on the writer’s informed/expert opinion.  This film is every bit the franchise blockbuster that studio Disney requires to be, but it’s also very much the embraceable and sustainable story fans wanted. This film is every bit the franchise blockbuster that studio Disney requires to be, but it’s also very much the embraceable and sustainable story fans wanted. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a movie that really wants us to love it, even more so than its crowd-pleasing predecessor, The Force Awakens. There are more jokes than before, sometimes at risk to the drama — imagine kidding about the solemn exhortation, “May the Force be with you.” Returning figures both vintage and recent will gladden the hearts of even the fussiest of Star Wars fanatics. These include Mark Hamill’s Jedi stalwart Luke Skywalker, who finally rejoins the main stage 34 years after Return of the Jedi, and the late Carrie Fisher’s Princess Leia (now Resistance-leading General Leia Organa), whose presence seemed in doubt following her untimely death last Christmas. (She’d already filmed most of her now-poignant scenes; the judicious use of CGI helps close any gaps.) Daisy Ridley’s Rey, John Boyega’s Finn and Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron are back as Resistance fighters, along with their mechanical and animal sidekicks, more heroic than ever in their continuing battle against the intergalactic menace called the First Order. New characters, sure to be fast fan favourites, are played by Laura Dern, Benicio del Toro and Kelly Marie Tran, the latter essaying the first major role for an Asian-American woman in a Star Wars film. All this affection deserves to be returned in kind, even if a new Star Wars film, now an annual event (last year brought the series spinoff Rogue One), is no longer the novelty it was when The Force Awakens premiered in 2015. The Last Jedi boasts many very good performances, ones that enrich the characters and which salute writer/director Johnson’s ability to find the humanity within technology, something he proved early on with his artful time-travel thriller Looper. With his trusty Looper cinematographer Steve Yedlin behind the lens for the film’s epic scenes, Johnson makes the multiple trials and temptations of the story worth caring about and gaping at. He also makes the villains truly villainous, unlike most recent blockbusters, with Andy Serkis and Adam Driver upping their evil games as the First Order’s Supreme Leader Snoke and lead warrior Kylo Ren. The many women in the cast are part and parcel of the saga, not to be trifled with. Woe to any guy, good or bad, who attempts to mansplain a situation in this movie. It must be said that there are also a lot of box-checking elements to this new Star Wars film, a.k.a. Episode VIII, that, as with all franchises, are deemed necessary to satisfy aficionados while also appealing to a global and diverse audience. These include the addition of puffin-like birds called porgs, which should by rights be called “adorbs” and which are little more than a craven attempt to sell toys (which will probably succeed). The film’s paunchy middle section includes a trip to a casino that might better have ended up on the cutting-room floor. The unnecessary padding accounts for the 152-minute running time, a franchise record, which will test the patience (and bladders) of even the most devoted followers. J.J. Abrams’ The Force Awakens borrowed heavily from the original Star Wars movie A New Hope, to the delight of most (and dismay of some) after the prequel trilogy of nearly 20 years ago controversially chose to forgo a lot of what people loved about the original trilogy. The Last Jedi is cannier and also more catholic about its provenance. This latest chapter in the 40-year-old Star Wars saga judiciously and often cleverly lifts from the other two films in the original canon, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. It begins with John Williams’ stirring score and the familiar scene-setting scroll, which warns of how the Empire-inspired First Order is gaining the upper hand on the plucky but outnumbered Resistance, led in remote planetary exile by Fisher’s grimly determined Gen. Organa. An air battle against an attacking First Order Dreadnought warship, featuring Isaac’s X-Wing fighter pilot Poe and his roly-poly droid sidekick BB-8, thrillingly demonstrates just how much resolve remains in the Resistance. Cut to Jedi island enclave Ahch-To (actually heritage site Skellig Michael, off the southern coast of Ireland), the scene where The Force Awakens ended. Ridley’s Force-awakened Rey momentously proffers a legendary lightsaber to Hamill’s Skywalker, who is puzzled by her presence. At this point, remaining plot description should be limited to a now-famous exclamation by Skywalker, heard in the trailer: “This is not going to go the way you think!” He intends this as a warning to a character. The rest of us, however, should take it as reassurance that while The Last Jedi is every bit the franchise blockbuster that studio Disney requires it to be, it’s also very much the embraceable and sustainable story we hoped it would be.

"Dec 12, 2017",NEGATIVE," What do you want from a Star Wars film? When it comes to The Last Jedi, the eighth episode in the Skywalker saga, that question gets to the heart of what you’re going to get from this film.  What worked brilliantly about The Force Awakens was its unabashed embrace of nostalgia. Its form was so predictable that I wrote a “pre-review” for Episode VII prior to its release, noting that Abrams’ was meant to serve as catharsis. His job was to not “fuck it up” and to “keep things relatively simple, make people remember what they loved about these films and give them that.” Meanwhile, I hoped that “Rian Johnson’s next film may prove to be the real interesting one, where the slate has been wiped to a certain extent and more dark and dramatic themes can again be explored. The burden isn’t there on Episode VIII to strictly give the people what they want, and so it may be the more original and effective of the flicks.” Despite all these predictions, the most satisfying thing about my first viewing of The Last Jedi was that it continuously managed to surprise. Rian Johnson knows the source material deeply, and in the same way knows how to toy with the expectations of general audiences and hardcore fans alike. While J.J. Abrams’ film got the ship out of the landing dock, Rian takes us along for a ride (some may say too long at over 2 ½ hours), finding detours along the way that managed to entertain and enthral in equal measure. This is the first of any of the so-called “saga” films that starts immediately following the last, making it in some ways more akin to how Rogue One will dovetails with A New Hope if played as part of a marathon. In some ways this makes for abrupt changes with the motivations of the characters as they swing quickly in different directions. At the same time, this direct follow-on does give the narrative a more immediate feel – We have grown accustomed to time ellipsis in these films where characters became closer or further apart, yet here we’re just as off kilter and trying to stay one step ahead as the fleeing rebels. Of all the things predictable about Johnson’s vision for the film, I wasn’t expecting a movie quite so playful and funny in between the bleak, tragic elements. A failure of my own imagination and faith in the director to so powerfully balance light and dark. There’s a goofiness that’s refreshing, and even if there’s one too many shots of the disgustingly cute Porgs, their inclusion is indicative of the thrill the filmmaker brings to simply playing in this sandbox.  Those things that are taken seriously, from training sequences to the space battles endemic to this saga, for the most part avoid feeling procedural or rote. Johnson’s script manages to find new ways of doing the same, while at the same time expanding on fundamental aspects of the underlying ethos of the force, Jedi training, leadership, sacrifice, and so on. Visually the film is at times stunning, from a salt-covered blood-red plane that provided a beautiful metaphor for the pain under the exterior, to sleek expansions of the Imperial aesthetic drawn from the original trilogy. Camera placement is at times quite different from what’s come before, and it provides unique angles that give the work a feel of its own. There’s little in the way of overt showiness, but it nonetheless feels both original and respectful of the established look. This is but one of dozens of dialectics at play, no surprise for a film that fundamentally looks at the dark/light dichotomy in myriad forms and finds grey in between. For those that scoffed at Lucas’ fascination with the “balance of the force” in the Prequels now find this fundamental notion at the core of this sequel trilogy (even if, admittedly, “midichlorians” haven’t come up in discussion up as yet).  The Last Jedi provides deep dives into many of these established dualities, finding complexity in the master/student relationship, the ambiguity of a commander in a rebellion who subverts command rebelliously, or the apprentice who may yet best the master.  Cut to the core The Last Jedi takes the best of both The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi and gently twists the elements around. It’s when these prior events are subverted that the film is the most interesting, and this is the skill that Johnson exhibited with Looper that I was most looking forward to with this project, taking a myriad of references, echoes and even clichés and crafting something new and compelling out of it. It’s this alchemy that’s the most exhilarating about the film, finding ways of becoming more engaged, more emotionally invested in moments that previously were masked by whiz-bang pyrotechnics. There isn’t another Death Star to blow up here, thankfully, even if there are similar quests at hand. Yet unlike a mere repetition, Johnson bookends Last Jedi with two different missions, humanizing both battles in ways that were best seen in the final few moments of Rogue One as nameless soldiers made deep sacrifices. This is the first Star Wars film where someone takes time to quietly sob in a corner, the daily sufferings of those engaged in battle exemplified by characters that aren’t all Jedis, generals, and princesses.  The Skywalker saga has always been a kind of rags-to-riches-to-ruin tale, where both Anakin and Luke emerged from a backwater, looking from the outside, only to be thrust into the very fabric of high level political society. The Last Jedi teases this out even further, exploding just a little bit the “small universe” shtick where on a galactic scale the same retinue of familiar characters, be they good or evil, are always running into one another.  The only time this irks is when the character of Phasma makes her return. As much as I’m a fan of the costume and Gwendoline Christie who inhabits the suit, this remains the most tacked on element of the film, an inelegant inclusion of a character who never really has lived up to expectations. The same argument could be made for Boba Fett shoehorned into the Special Edition of A New Hope or his ignominious Sarlaac encounter on Tatooine, but that’s the stuff for another nerdy debate. Yes, the film is the longest in the series, but it’s told swiftly and easily could have accommodated a few more minutes to flesh out some of the sequences that feel a bit rushed. It’s a film of boldness and ambition, and even if it doesn’t always live up to what it’s striving to communicate it’s to be applauded by taking seriously its mission of expanding what’s come before while doing justice to the best of the past. There are some simple images that are indelible – a wonderful shot down a bomb bay hatch, a surreal mirrored visit during a training sequence, and a terrific sight gag by a certain astromech droid.  On a bittersweet note, Carrie Fisher’s loss is amplified by her final performance, a real gift for fans of the character that she’s most closely associated with. She stood around and seemed superfluous last film, here her heart is at the center of most of what takes place. It’s a fine send off to a legend. With all its pieces it can be somewhat overwhelming, and for those slightly less inculcated in this world it may take another visit to truly make sense of it all. Kids may find it less appealing, and casual fans maybe confused. It helps to remember that the very same criticisms were levelled at Empire Strikes Back, a film that took decades to firmly establish itself as the prime element of the canon. The Last Jedi reaches towards the heights of that film, and in many ways manages to equal or better what came before. I cannot speak to how this film will be embraced collectively, nor do I particularly care about its box office potential. I can say that this film lived up to the high expectations that Rian Johnson would give us something worth chewing on, a darker, slyer, sillier film that manages to answer long-held questions and raise new ones along the way. There’s real joy at play here, a filmmaker clearly influenced deeply by Lucas’ vision but confident and capable enough to wrestle the world to be his own. If J.J.’s film gave us the popcorn thrills, Johnson gives us a more filling meal that still manages to provide moments of giddy excitement.  With the promise of an entirely new trilogy far removed from the Skywalkers, Johnson is primed to be the new master of this cinematic universe. Abrams is a fine choice to close out the series, and while he’s not known for capable endings the elements are well laid for him to sweep it all together and give us the warranted catharsis. So, what do you want from your Star Wars? Something fun, fluffy with a bit of fanciful to make it interesting? You got that with Force Awakens.  If instead you want to dive deeper into what’s come before, to see things previously hinted at taken seriously but not portentously, and to be even more emotionally and spiritually engaged in the narrative then The Last Jedi is the film for you. Its flaws are the result of overreach rather than trying to appease everyone. It feels throughout as a highly personal film made within the constraints of an existing franchise, a blockbuster with the beating heart of its creator worn proudly on its sleeve.  That Shelf sat down with Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver’s director and cast to discuss Netflix’s ambitious sci-fi sequel.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," The main movie event of the year is on its way, just in time for Christmas season again. Star Wars: The Last Jedi arrives this weekend to transport all of us -- and our box office dollars -- to a galaxy far, far away. The third new Star Wars movie from Disney-Lucasfilm in as many years, The Last Jedi is Rian Johnson's first foray into this sci-fantasy universe but certainly won't be his last, as Lucasfilm is very pleased with what he delivered and offered him his own new trilogy of pictures under the Star Wars series banner. How does The Last Jedi stack up compared to the rest of the saga, and will it deliver box office glory like its predecessors? I'll just say outright that I don't expect The Last Jedi to match the runaway box office magic that turned The Force Awakens into a $2+ billion performer in 2015. Being the first Star Wars movie in 12 years, the first new sequel to the original Star Wars trilogy in 34 years, and bringing a sense of pure joy and delight that many fans felt was missing from the Star Wars prequel trilogy (I don't fully agree, but I understand the point) created a special convergence of circumstances that added to The Force Awaken's quality, it's Christmas holiday positioning, and the clear field it had in the marketplace due to other studios getting out of its way. Yes, The Last Jedi will ride audience goodwill and expectations after The Force Awakens, but remember 2016's Rogue One: A Star Wars Story had Christmas positioning and was in closer proximity to The Force Awakens yet still wound up finishing with just north of $1 billion globally. There's nothing wrong with topping $1 billion, obviously, and there are additional factors that played into Rogue One grossing only about half as much as The Force Awakens -- it lacked the same cast, for one thing, and was marketed differently, not to mention being a bit less overtly ""family friendly"" since it was definitely much more akin to a war movie. Still, we can't ignore that the Star Wars brand alone wasn't enough to make it play closer to the financial range of the previous series entry. At about 2 hours 15 minutes, The Force Awakens had a shorter runtime than The Last Jedi, which clocks in at just over 2 hours 30 minutes. The former was probably what most people would consider more ""rewatchable,"" too -- especially within a short period of time. Meaning I strongly suspect repeat theatrical viewings were more likely for The Force Awakens than will be the case for The Last Jedi, particularly in terms of families going back multiple times with their kids. Part of the reason I expect less repeat family business for The Last Jedi is that it's not just a longer movie and a less overtly joyful movie, it's also outright darker and has more mature themes. Not that The Force Awakens lacked such moments, but overall it was quite different tonally, with faster pacing as well. Lastly, there's not a crowded marketplace competing for the same demographics, but The Last Jedi does face a bit more competition (relatively speaking) than The Force Awakens. Not that anything has a shot at seriously challenging the dominance of this picture, but the first three weekends include the animated Ferdinand on the same opening weekend, Downsizing and Pitch Perfect 3 on the second weekend, and The Greatest Showman and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle on weekend number three. There's no way that collection won't pull a decent amount of box office revenue that otherwise might've gone to The Last Jedi. None of this will prevent The Last Jedi from making massive amounts of money, of course. It will get rave reviews and an audience Cinemascore of A, so word of mouth and press coverage will all be extremely positive and help drive attendance to high levels, ensuring a big opening weekend and strong week to week holds. That said, as of right now and admittedly without having seen any specific box office data yet, I don't think it will hit $2 billion. It will certainly top $1 billion, as there's no realistic scenario where that doesn't happen (unless we're contemplating asteroid collisions with Earth or Yellowstone National Park erupting). But beyond that, it becomes tricky to guess. The Last Jedi is projected to open at $200+ million domestic, so a 3.4x final multiplier akin to Rogue One would push it to $680 million domestic, and a roughly 50-50 domestic/foreign split like that film would point to a final worldwide box office of $1.3+ billion. If it winds up more similar to The Force Awakens' multiplier and domestic/foreign split, then a $200 million opening translates into $754 million in North America and $1.5+ billion worldwide. The lower-end opening potential would be about $190 million, so reduce the above figures by around 5% and the needle doesn't move all that much, relatively speaking, but it's enough to keep The Last Jedi from passing $1.5 billion even with the better multiplier. On the higher end of opening weekend potential, it could hit $210+ million, which means $714+ million domestic and $1.4+ billion globally, so the higher the opening weekend, the more likely the film can make a run at $1.5+ billion territory. My guess is an opening in the $205 million range, a final domestic cume of about $710 million, and a final worldwide tally in the $1.4 billion range. That's my moderate estimate, so I'll note that I think a better performance is very possible, and if it opens stronger and has a great hold on the second weekend, then I'll likely revise my predictions upward. At this point, I'd bet the high-end final worldwide take is in the $1.7 billion range, and low-end is in the $1.3 billion range. There will be some articles and estimates that imply a final cume below $2 billion -- or not within a hundred or so million bucks of that territory -- is some sort of failure, but it's definitely not. I'd say a performance below $1.4 billion is where we would start to talk about ""underperformance,"" with $1.4-1.5 billion being acceptable moderate performance territory and $1.6-1.7+ billion being where the film prefers to hit. Anything from $1.8+ billion or higher is really going to be an enormous success, overcoming all of the ""obstacles"" (for lack of a better word) discussed above and managing to finish in close proximity to The Force Awakens. But keep in mind, ""underperformance"" at $1.3-1.399 billion wouldn't mean it's a ""financial failure,"" since break-even point for this movie is somewhere around $800 million (budget plus global marketing etc being in the vicinity of $400 million, and the studio getting roughly half of the box office receipts, to oversimplify a bit). Underperforming just means it plays lower than expected and lower than it probably should have and could have. I don't expect that to happen at all, mind you, I'm just noting for the record where that line sits and why it doesn't mean ""failure."" Johnson (who not only directed but also wrote The Last Jedi) has created a picture of gorgeous color, intense and awesome camera work, glorious visual effects, and memorable sequences. Once all of the pieces are on the board and in their necessary positions, the story kicks into high gear. The characters come fully to vivid life with wonderful character arcs and interactions, overlapping the original cast and new performers that more fully bridges the two generations. The final hour of the film's two-and-a-half hour runtime is nearly perfect. It's a tour de force of action-adventurism and dazzling visual spectacle combined with excellent emotionally resonant performances fulfilling many converging arcs in a breathtaking climax that's surely among the greatest of the Star Wars series. Tonally, the film has similarities to The Empire Strikes Back, Rogue One, and Return of the Jedi. The story itself does -- like most Star Wars movies, let's face it -- borrow heavily from previous chapters and follows a lot of the same beats. However, it does so in a way that is both familiar and yet tries to use our expectations of routine to set us up for surprises, to find new ways to approach this familiar territory. Mostly, it succeeds, particularly in the final hour. But I cannot deny some misgivings about the earlier portions of the film, particularly a first act that felt unpolished, tonally inconsistent, and at times padded and repetitive. There are a lot of attempts at humor in the first hour or so, with varying degrees of success. The first act's humor is the shakiest, with some gags seeming more like something out of a Star Wars satire. The tone and irreverence of it was out of place, and a couple of bits went on one or two beats too long. Once the balance of jokes to drama settled into a better rhythm, it didn't last very long before the story moved into the final hour and most of the humor faded away in favor of high-tension action and drama. That's not a complaint about the final hour lacking humor, but rather a complaint about the way humor was used (or misused) earlier in the film. There were also some on-the-nose moments in the story and dialogue reminding me of certain elements in the prequels that generated a lot of complaints. I can't go into specifics here, to avoid spoilers, but suffice to say we get multiple instances of people giving literal explanations and voice to themes and messages (and there are a lot of those in The Last Jedi) better left as subtext or demonstrated through story and action. Making this even more frustrating is the fact the film has other terrific moments of subtext that require reading between the lines to understand the deeper, complex meaning of relationships and themes instead of having characters stop in the middle of scenes to explain them with flat, cliched exposition. It doesn't help that much of this contrast in subtext versus unwanted exposition transpires in parallel sequences jumping from one set of characters to another. The Last Jedi is filled with multiple subplots and locations, so we are constantly jumping from one to the other every few minutes, which is fine and fun when those subplots all work and speak to one another, but is less effective when it highlights weaknesses in certain developments. The result is that portions of the movie feel like they were written by someone else, and more importantly like they are first or second drafts of those particular subplots than a final polished work. Which leads into another problem I mentioned briefly earlier -- the pacing. Watching the first hour, I had the uncomfortable sense that maybe it needed trimming by about ten minutes or so, and that Rey's and Luke's story kept stalling and going in circles for a while. Then, the pacing in the last hour is so spot-on, it confirms all of those earlier feelings. Adding to the problem is the choice of starting point for the film. I realize kicking off with a more action-driven sequence has benefits, but it felt disorienting since we remember how the last film ended and probably want to pick up that thread first. It was an easy call, I feel, and the film's choice merely confirms my own sense that there was a better option. There are other more minor flaws and complaints I have, but one final thing worth mentioning that isn't minor is Luke's characterization. Mark Hamill steps back into the character of Luke Skywalker like he never left, easily picking up the mannerisms and personality for a great overall performance. The problem is, the film makes him regress for much of the story, demonstrating a personality and lack of deeper self-awareness -- or awareness of the world around him -- akin to his behavior and outlook in The Empire Strikes Back. Granted, people often do regress in life, and Luke's personality suggests maybe he's the sort of person who would backslide into his rasher, pessimistic, resentful attitudes. But there were better, subtler ways to achieve the necessary story and character results without so blatantly turning the clock back on his personal emotional and spiritual development. It's not all bad, don't get me wrong -- much of it works, there's some underlying subtext and reasoning in several scenes that justify certain of his reactions and views, and it all eventually works out and pays off. But I can't overlook those first act moments that felt out of place, and which went in circles (even dialogue is repetitive without resolution or point) while wasting precious development opportunities. Okay, I said I'd get back to praising the film, so let's do that. Despite the problems in the first half-plus of The Last Jedi, those problems exist amid lots of other moments and elements that do work, and overall the good still outweighs the bad during that mixed period. Any scene or sequence containing flaws and problematic elements also has plenty of other things to enjoy and that work with varying degrees of success. The first act is the most problematic for me, so after about 30-40 minutes it starts to improve with regard to the most bothersome flaws, and after another half-hour or so things rapidly improve as it enters the final phenomenal hour. The cast do tremendous job juggling a complicated narrative with many moving parts and separate arcs, subplots, and developments. While this sometimes causes stumbles and highlights certain problems, it also ultimately speaks to how big and ambitious the film is at heart. It's a testament to the strength of the cast, Johnson's creative vision, and the series' inherent power that it all comes together into something greater than the sum of its parts. The Last Jedi also has the best visual effects of the saga, and rivals Rogue One's cinematography as the best in the series. It's not a spoiler to say this film, like all other Star Wars movies, includes a lightsaber battle, and it's jaw-dropping both in choreography and in sumptuous colors and shot-framing. Space dogfights and ground combat likewise will take your breath away, and are alone worth the price of admission. I am obviously avoiding saying too much about the cast, since it's hard to talk about them without touching on or hinting at some surprises and spoilers. But one I have to mention here is Carrie Fisher in her final bow as Princess/General Leia. I've watched the Star Wars films in theaters from the beginning, as a little kid in the late-1970s and later as a teenager and then as an adult. I love all of the films, even the oft-maligned prequels. No Star Wars movie is less than a 3.5 star film in my estimation, the best being 5 star and most of them residing in the 4-4.5 range. This is the final time I'll ever get to see Fisher as Leia in a brand new Star Wars adventure, and it's such a bittersweet feeling. She is powerful, sympathetic, and so much the heart of the Rebellion and of this particular story that it's hard to imagine moving on without her. It's a grand final performance, and she will always be our Princess and our General. Star Wars: The Last Jedi gets off to a bit of an uneven start, but finds its footing eventually and goes out with a blast. It's not the best of the series, and not the best of the new films, but it's still a worthwhile entry in the continuing saga and sets up a future with lots of potential to move beyond everything that came before."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"A spectacular, full-throttle joyride of thrills, exhilarating, screen-filling visuals, emotional heft and humor, with familiar characters and new faces we'll almost certainly be seeing again."
"Dec 12, 2017",NEUTRAL," Its December so that means it is time for another Star Wars movie. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the latest entry in the Star Wars franchise. This time around indie director Rian Johnson takes control of George Lucas’ beloved universe and builds upon what J.J. Abrams started in the Force Awakens. To my surprise, The Last Jedi doesn’t pick up on the exact moment where the Force Awakens left off but instead opens on a 10-15 minute scene where we see Poe working alongside Leia to protect the Resistance from General Hux, Kylo Ren, and Supreme Leader Snoke. After this opening battle, which is used to set up a good portion of the plot,  we get to see Rey talking to Luke Skywalker. As you probably expect, and for the sake of not spoiling the fun, Rey and Luke Skywalker go back and forth for a bit and sooner rather than later, we begin to learn a thing or two about their past that helps to develop their characters and storylines even further. There is also a third storyline as well involving Finn and newcomer Rose. All the storylines eventually come together and lead up to Episode IX. It is always difficult to review a Star Wars film without spoiling things. The general plot of most of these films is basically the same. Its the good guys fighting the bad guys and then there are new characters introduced who do something to help or expand the plot. I can also say that some of the characters introduced in the Force Awakens are developed a bit more especially Rey and Kylo Ren but that is to be expected since this new trilogy is banking on these characters for the future of this franchise. In all fairness, almost half of the details that I would want to discuss in greater detail would be considered spoilers and I don’t want to be THAT GUY.  I will do my best to not give anything away that you didn’t already know from the trailers or tv spots. Since the release of The Force Awakens, I have come to accept that my initial review of the film is a bit more generous than it should’ve been. While I do think Force Awakens is a decent film as a whole, it is a by the numbers re-imagining of A New Hope with a more diverse cast and less interesting characters. I originally gave the film a 7 as a critic and an 8 as a Star Wars fan but if I had to write that review again today, I would give it a 6 as a critic and a 7 as a fanboy.  With that being said, The Last Jedi is better than The Force Awakens. It does feel like more of the same but at the same time, but there are a few more standout moments that make it shine slightly brighter than its predecessor. I give Rian Johnson a lot of credit for mixing nostalgia with a series of genuinely exciting and entertaining moments that fans will go nuts over. There are at least four scenes that come to mind that will have fans raving about for days. There is one involving Rey and Kylo Ren, one involving Leia and Luke, and one featuring Kylo Ren and Luke Skywalker near the end of the film. The fourth one that I mentioned I can’t really talk about at all because it is a total spoiler but let’s just say that it involves Luke and someone from the original trilogy who has yet to make an appearance in this new trilogy. There is a lot of talk in the Last Jedi about out with the old, in with the new. As these new entries continue to be made, we are slowly seeing that the story arcs are becoming more about the new characters and less about the old ones. This isn’t exactly a bad thing but I am a bit worried since The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi relies very heavily on the characters from the original trilogy. It almost makes me wonder if the Star Wars franchise will ever be truly great without them. Characters like Poe, Finn, and Fey are interesting to a certain degree but they aren’t the original cast. They are being set up to take control of this franchise but their characters lack the development that is needed in order to make them truly iconic. They all come off as characters that we have seen before. There isn’t much new about them other than their skin color which might be controversial to say but its sort of true when you really sit back and look at the way that things have been set up thus far. Poe is still my favorite of the newer characters because Oscar Issac is a great actor who is able to use his charm, wit, and energy to make his character stand out. You can really tell that Poe has the potential to become an iconic character but still isn’t given enough to do as of yet. He definitely takes charge in this entry and you can see that the story is slowly setting him up to become a major player. Kylo Ren still throws temper tantrums but I will admit that I liked Driver a lot more this time around. He is growing with the character and fits better into the role. I feel like the actions of Kylo Ren are not all that surprising, if you have seen all the previous films. My audience seemed a bit shocked when certain things involving his character occurred but I found it all a bit too predictable. I would have loved for the film to have taken more risks then it did especially with what ultimately occurs between Kylo Ren and Rey. Speaking of Rey, Daisy Ridley’s character didn’t do much for me this time around. Ridley gets to act alongside Mark Hamill and Adam Driver for most of the film but Rey just isn’t all that interesting to watch.  This makes me sad since the film’s plot is partially centered around her learning about Force and how to use it.  Rey does have a few moments where she shines but they are few and far between. It is also interesting to note that a lot of the Force Awakens was spent building the relationship between Rey and Finn. Ridley and Boyega barely share any screen time this time around which is a good thing since I personally felt they didn’t have any chemistry in the first place. I think prior to making the film, Johnson saw this and decided to separate them and paired Finn with Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) whose chemistry actually works.  Finn doesn’t get as much screentime this time around and his character development is minimum. I would even say that out of all the characters introduced in the Force Awakens, he is the one who seems to be overlooked the most in this entry. I can’t say whether that is a good thing or a bad thing because he does get to share the screen with Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose who is incredibly likable and the two actors play off one another with such ease. They have a very natural chemistry so I am somewhat interested to see where their story goes and if there will be some sort of love triangle story arc developed in the next entry. Mark Hamill steals the show as Luke Skywalker. Hamill’s line delivery and his use of sarcasm are as perfect as always. He has some great scenes and will be the character that most will be talking about while exiting the theater. Leia is good too and continues to impress. Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo played by Laura Dern is a great character who I would have loved to see more of. She shares most of her screentime with Oscar Issac and Carrie Fisher so she is in good company. I liked the character but felt like she was sort of just there to help move the story along. Domnall Gleason as General Hux is still pretty bad. I like that Rian Johnson pretty much acknowledges that Gleason’s Hux isn’t very good at being menacing so he decided to mock the character by adding a comedic side to his role this time around. I will say that Gleason is a total miscast for this role and his performance continues to come off as wooden. He looks so out of place and his line delivery is just laughably bad. Andy Serkis as Snoke is great because Serkis is a master at playing these types of characters. His voice really fits the role and you feel a genuine sense of fear whenever Snoke opens his mouth. There are far too many characters in this film. There are characters from the original trilogy, characters from the new one, plus several new additions that include humans, robots, creatures, and the Porgs. I feel like some of these things were a bit overkill and just thrown into the film wherever Johnson could fit something in. It’s like “oh, here is a scene with Chewbacca, how can we make it different? Let’s have him hang out with the Porgs.”  The dark version of BB8 was also haphazardly introduced as well. There honestly doesn’t need to be this constant introduction to new characters all the damn time. I feel like these films are going overboard as a way to just sell merchandise for the film.  Another example is Captain Phasma who shows up again for like a five-minute scene. When are they going to develop this character? She seems awesome but yet instead of focusing on Phasma let’s introduce some random characters like a bad BB8, the Porgs, or some random creatures that are simply known as the caregivers to Luke Skywalker. Its a little too much to say the least. Even Benicio Del Toro shows up in the film for about 15 minutes and his character is great but again seems like he is just thrown into the mix as a way to move the story along. You don’t really get to learn much about any of the new characters and this seems to be an on-going issue with this new trilogy. You have all these characters that have so much potential but instead of just focusing on the core four or five, there is always an introduction of several secondary characters that you sort of like because they are cute or entertaining but truth be told, you don’t really know much about any of them. I have other issues with the film too. The script is incredibly formulaic and doesn’t take any risks. Johnson tries to trick the audience to believe that something different is going to happen with a lot of build up but ultimately it ends up playing out as you always expected it to. There is too much fan service even if it isn’t as on the nose as it was in the Force Awakens. It almost seems like it was built into the plot this time around instead of having certain scenes that were directly geared towards the fans. I don’t think that this is a huge problem but again when you rely so heavily on the originals and then attempt to get rid of everyone from the original, it’s going to be hard to strike that perfect balance in the end. The 2 hr and 30-minute runtime really hurt the film. I feel like there are just certain spots throughout the film where it just drags. It hard to pinpoint exactly when and where they occur on just one viewing but I was definitely bored at times. Some of the dialogue is just bad and I mean, really bad. I found myself laughing at certain spots where I know the film wasn’t supposed to be funny. There was this odd combination of bad dialogue mixed with overacting that occurs several times throughout the film. I don’t even know how some of these scenes made it into the final cut of the film. Speaking of laughs, the jokes and humor just fall flat.  The jokes seemed out of place or were just so “on the nose” that I couldn’t help but be annoyed by them. I feel like the modern day humor didn’t feel the tone of the story and yet Johnson kept trying to lighten the mood by adding in cheesy jokes that weren’t even remotely amusing but instead were rather cringe-worthy. Lastly, there is a lot more CGI in this one. I found it beyond distracting and obvious when it was being used. I hope this doesn’t continue to happen but who really knows at this point. All in all, Star Wars fanboys and fangirls will enjoy The Last Jedi despite all of its flaws. While I don’t think this new trilogy will ever connect with me, the same way that the original did, I do believe a whole new generation will grow to love this franchise. Star Wars, in a lot of ways, has become a lot like a Marvel film. It has a built-in audience that is invested and will continue to support the franchise always and forever. The Last Jedi may not be a flawless film but continues to push the story forward. The film has a lot going for it and Rian Johnson seems to understand exactly what Star Wars fans are looking for. There is a lot of rewatch value for fans which means there will be a lot more theories that will begin to surface upon repeat viewings. As I did with the Force Awakens two years ago, I will rate The Last Jedi on two different levels. As a Star Wars fan, it’s a 7 out of 10 but as a critic, it is a 6 out of 10. My overall feelings towards the film are more in line with the 6 out of 10 rating but that’s because I don’t consider myself a die-hard Star Wars fan and found a good portion of this film to be rather underwhelming. As a lover of all things film, I can’t help but expect more from tent-pole films especially something as noteworthy and heavily discussed as Star Wars."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Star Wars: The Last Jedi builds upon Star Wars history for a more expansive, high-stakes adventure with plenty of fresh – and classic – elements.  Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi is the middle chapter of Lucasfilm's latest trilogy set within the Star Wars universe, though this is the first trilogy since Disney acquired the studio - and the first without original creator George Lucas at the creative helm. Instead, writer/director Rian Johnson takes the reins from J.J. Abrams, who kicked off this new installment of the Skywalker Saga in Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens. The Last Jedi is tasked with continuing the story of The Force Awakens' heroes, and bridging the gap to the concluding installment, Star Wars: Episode IX. Star Wars: The Last Jedi builds upon Star Wars history for a more expansive, high-stakes adventure with plenty of fresh – and classic – elements.   The Last Jedi returns to a galaxy far, far away where, though the Resistance was able to take out the First Order's Starkiller Base, the rebels must flee their own base in order to survive. In an effort to restore hope to the dwindling Resistance forces, the young, Force-sensitive hero Rey (Daisy Ridley) seeks out Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). While Rey needs a master Jedi to teach her in the ways of the Force, she also attempts to convince the legendary Jedi to return to the fight. However, it becomes apparent that after Rey's showdown with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) on Starkiller Base, their fates are intertwined, especially in regards to their allegiances to either the Dark Side or the Light.   Meanwhile, General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), works with the other leaders of the Resistance - including Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern) - to flee from the First Order and live to fight another day. In an attempt to help the Resistance, Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) sends Finn (John Boyega) and Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) on a mission to retrieve a codebreaker from the extravagant planet of Canto Bight. With Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and the rest of his First Order forces, commanded by General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), closing in on the Resistance, it'll be up to the heroes to save the day and make sure the spark of hope among the rebellion lives on.   When Abrams revived the main Star Wars series with The Force Awakens in 2015, the director was tasked with continuing a story that was, for all intents and purposes, finished. However, the filmmaker was able to reinvigorate the franchise by utilizing enough new elements mixed with classic characters and dynamics that fans flocked to the theater and propelled The Force Awakens to astonishing box office success. Now, Johnson's The Last Jedi is set with an arguably even more difficult task, to continue the stories of both the original and new generation of heroes in a compelling manner. Thankfully, Johnson provides a story with classic Star Wars themes of hope and good vs. evil, with plenty of development for characters new and old - and some truly exciting twists.   What makes The Last Jedi the most unique installment of the Star Wars franchise to date, though, is how big it feels, and how weighty the stakes are. The disparate forces of the Resistance and the First Order (or whichever name the sides of good and evil are going by) have never been felt quite as much as in The Last Jedi, and the desperation of the rebels is an ongoing thread throughout the entire film. These stakes set the stage for a breathlessly exciting fight between the crushing weight of an oppressive regime and the ragtag group of rebels who dare to fight for what is right. While that's been the main theme of Star Wars since the original trilogy, Johnson grounds The Last Jedi in a way that the film offers viewers much better insight into the true scope of the war the rebels are fighting.   But, although the bigger picture of the fate of the galaxy looms constantly in the background of The Last Jedi, the movie is rooted in compelling character drama - led, of course, by Rey. The young Force-sensitive scavenger from Jakku is a long way from home on her journey to learn the ways of the Force, and Ridley proves adept at bringing charm and pure heroism to the role. Hamill, in his first true return to the role of Luke Skywalker, brings to life a much different version of the character than what fans remember - but it is a wholly memorable turn that will leave viewers satisfied. Further, the other two members of the new Star Wars trio, Finn and Poe, are each afforded their moments to shine. Though Boyega and Isaac don't necessarily have meaty character arcs like Ridley's Rey, they continue to bring heart and humor to the story. This is especially apparent when it comes to Finn's mission with Rose - played by Tran, who is a notable standout in a sizable and remarkably talented cast.   Unfortunately, The Last Jedi doesn't use the entirety of its cast to their best advantages, and a number of characters feel short-changed for the sake of not overstuffing what's already a two and a half hour movie. The Last Jedi is undoubtedly the most ambitious Star Wars movie in terms of scope, cast, and sheer length, but the different storylines - while linked thematically - can feel disjointed at times. Still, The Last Jedi is tightly woven, with a breakneck pacing that helps to propel viewers forward. Plus, with characters and a rebellion to which viewers are already attached, and The Last Jedi setting up major stakes, it's easy to remain invested even when jumping from one corner of the galaxy to another.   All in all, there is plenty that does work in The Last Jedi. Johnson has helped usher this latest Star Wars trilogy into new territory that not only brings plenty of fresh ideas to the table, but honors the original movies as well. And the writer-director has done so with such breathtaking visuals and a deft hand that it's not hard to see why Lucasfilm would give him his own Star Wars trilogy. Johnson has not only met what were undeniably high expectations with his installment in one of the biggest movie franchises in history, he's exceeded them. As The Force Awakens proved with its success in 2015, Star Wars is a massively beloved franchise, and The Last Jedi elevates what was already a storied sci-fi/fantasy saga - and sets expectations even impossibly higher for Abrams' return to the trilogy with Episode IX.   Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi starts playing in theaters on Thursday evening, December 15th. It runs 152 minutes and is rated PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi action and violence.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Parece que Star Wars ha aprendido de sus errores. Los últimos Jedi llega como la película que debió iniciar el nuevo camino de la saga en manos de Disney. Aquí estamos frente a una cinta llena de acción, momentos memorables, secuencias entrañables y una alta dosis de aventura y emoción, algo característico de la trilogía original iniciada en 1977. Incluso describir la trama podría ser contraproducente, ya que una de las principales atractivos de la cinta es que el camino narrativo que toma está lleno de sorpresas y nos deja claro, desde el principio, que no estamos ante la misma historia que El Imperio contraataca. Star Wars The Last Jedi, el octavo episodio del universo cinematográfico supera por mucho a la cinta dirigida por JJ Abrams hace un par de años y deja el sabor de boca de que Lucasfilm –ahora en manos de Disney– aprendió de sus errores y supo que lo que más nos emocionó de Rogue One fue la forma en la que vimos a nuestros héroes en el campo de batalla. Esta cinta da la impresión de que ya no se tiene miedo a que los héroes de la historia se ensucien las manos y de que la adversidad los lleve al límite. Todo esto, como espectadores, nos da la posibilidad de ir experimentando una serie de emociones y sorpresas que sólo una saga cómo ésta nos puede dar. Rian Johnson logra un trabajo digno y a la altura de lo que otros directores hicieron en la trilogía original. Es evidente el fanatismo y cariño del director por esas cintas. Si bien hay algunas secuencias y elementos que recuerdan a lo ocurrido en películas como Una nueva esperanza o El regreso del Jedi, el Episodio VIII nunca se siente como una copia o imitación de algo que ya habíamos visto, tal y como sucedió con El despertar de la Fuerza. El trabajo de Johnson aquí nos deja con una sensación de que el futuro de la saga –propiamente en la nueva trilogía a su cargo– está en buenas manos. La mayoría de su elenco logra destacar lo mejor de sus personajes. Y la presencia de algunos, como Oscar Isaac como Poe Dameron o Kelly Marie Tran como Rose Tico, llega a opacar a los protagonistas de esta cinta. Aunque su desempeño es mucho mejor que en El despertar de la Fuerza, tanto Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver y específicamente John Boyega –como Rey, Kylo Ren y Finn, respectivamente– siguen sin poder estar a la altura de los héroes clásicos de Star Wars. Vale la pena mencionar que los porgs no se convierten en eso que los fans tanto temían; no son un estorbo en la historia y ni llegan a ser tan molestos como Jar Jar Binks. Por su parte, la presencia de BB-9E es exactamente igual que la de Phasma en el episodio anterior; y hablando de ésta última, lo que vemos aquí es una total decepción. Lo que pudo haber sido uno de los personajes más icónicos de esta nueva trilogía, se convierte en algo totalmente intrascendente. Y pese a que sus protagonistas son, quizá, lo más flojo de la cinta, cada uno de los elementos que los rodean logran construir una cinta que inicia de una forma heroica, aspectos que poco a poco irán aumentando rumbo a un tercer acto por demás emocionante. Hay que decir que Mark Hamill entrega la versión más oscura y apasionante de Luke en toda la saga. Aunque sus mejores escenas tardan en llegar, lo que vemos aquí es la evolución de un personaje atormentado en una historia compleja que nos lleva rumbo a un tercer acto por demás apasionante. Todo esto es resaltado por el score magistral de John Williams, quien una vez más entrega un trabajo a la altura de lo que él mismo ha hecho en el resto de los episodios de la saga. Como siempre, escuchar su música en una sala de cine, acompañando a grandes secuencias de acción, es un enorme privilegio. Estamos, como ya sabemos, frente a la película de Star Wars de mayor duración. Si bien hay algunos pequeños momentos de los que se pudo haber prescindido, en ningún momento la cinta se siente cansada, o incluso lenta. Sin mencionar mayores detalles, habrá que decir que en esta cinta hay momentos que nos apuntan el camino posible que seguirá la saga. Existen algunas secuencias que se podrán sentir un poco fuera del contexto del universo creado por George Lucas. Sin embargo, a pesar de ello podemos afirmar que Star Wars The Last Jedi se convierte en una mezcla de lo mejor de todo el universo fílmico de Star Wars y nos deja el mensaje de que lo que viene será cada vez más emocionante.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," On the evidence of Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi at least, the philosopher George Santayana may have had it wrong. Those who remember the past are best off repeating it. Meanwhile, Rian Johnson has created an action-packed, faithful tribute to the original films, full of call-backs and in-jokes for fans well-versed in the lore of Luke Skywalker, Leia, Han Solo and Darth Vader (example: a throwaway line about Leia’s old “cinnamon bun” hairdo got a big laugh from the nerdier critics at my screening). In a way, Johnson (Looper) is like a skilled musician covering classic rock songs for a modern audience, throwing in flourishes, tweaking expectations on familiar riffs, but generally sticking to the melody. Underneath it all, the first film in this iteration, J.J. Abrams’ Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015) really was just a retooled retelling of 1977’s Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope. Right down to the trek-with-cute-droid through a desert planet, a young orphan who doesn’t know she’s really a Jedi, and the introduction of a Sith Lord with family ties. Those two, the young Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Darth Vader’s Dark-Lord-wannabe grandson Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) are obvious opposite poles in this story – the plot of which I will keep as general as possible. Suffice to say that The Last Jedi is pointedly very much like The Empire Strikes Back in terms of where it fits in this storyline. (Could this be the end of the Resistance? Sure looks that way). Make no mistake, the narrative is going forward, however much it resembles the old one, with a plethora of great space battles that resemble dogfights in old war films. Along the way, Johnson throws familiarity at us (Oh, that reminds me of Mos Eisley! That’s so Lando Calrissian!), sometimes playing it as expected and other times pulling the rug on our expectations. The cast of characters is slightly expanded from The Force Awakens. Hot-shot pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is back, disobeying orders from Princess/Admiral Leia (Carrie Fisher, whose off-screen death fuels plenty of rumours about her fate in this movie, which I obviously won't spoil). John Boyega returns as the former Imperial Storm Trooper Finn, with a new, hero-worshipping sidekick named Rose (Kelly Marie Tran). And the most motion-captured man in movie history, Andy Serkis is the apex villain, Supreme Leader Snoke (four out of five dermatologists agree, the job of emperor is bad for your skin). There’s a trick to taking something old and making it bigger, louder, more impressive, and yet still somehow familiar enough to sate our desire for the same. And with Last Jedi, Johnson pulls it off assuredly enough to please nearly everybody."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"The Last Jedi, however, opens up some new possibilities. It doesn't provide a ton of satisfying answers, but it creates some interesting questions. And it manages to make ""Star Wars"" feel new again."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," So far in the “Star Wars” saga, the galaxy as we know it has been defined largely in binary terms; the light and darkness, the Jedi and The Dark Side. Between it all is The Force, the powerful, binding agent that exists between all things, an intangible element that can be harnessed for good or evil. As “Star Wars” has been regenerated for a new generation, The Force has achieved near mythological status. In “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” former doubter Han Solo assures Rey that, “a magical power holding together good and evil, the dark side and the light….it’s true. The Force. The Jedi… All of it….” In “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” Donnie Yen’s Chirrut Îmwe is a faithful believer, with the the phrase “I’m one with the Force, and the Force is with me” acting as a devotional prayer of protection. However, if J.J. Abrams’ film served to nudge open the narrative possibilities of the franchise, Rian Johnson’s “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” daringly deconstructs the familiar ideals at its foundation. In his film, The Force can be a curse, and potential of its power is only equalled by the burden it puts on those who possess it. The story, the precise details of which won’t be spoiled here, sees the Resistance reconfiguring their strategy as the First Order continues to hunt them down. Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley), picks up where we last left her, on Luke Skywalker’s (Mark Hamill) remote island, urging him to come out of exile. Those are the broad strokes, and narratively, ‘The Last Jedi’ splits between a few straightforward, lean plotlines. However, the clean strokes of the unspooling adventure allow Johnson, who also wrote the screenplay, plenty of opportunity to thoughtfully play in between the spaces with the characters. It’s in this place — yes, between the darkness and light — where the riches of ‘The Last Jedi’ emerge. What follows is an often perilous parable about the folly of blind conviction when severed from true understanding, and the necessary cost and lessons to be learned from failure and sacrifice. Each of our lead characters — Rey, Finn (John Boyega), and Poe (Oscar Isaac) — are tested, their eagerness to become heroes rattled by a growing awareness of the complex realities and repercussions of their actions. Emotional and spiritual conflict is seeded in their hearts to varying degrees, and even Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) longs for understanding of his own volatile nature. ‘The Last Jedi’ is very much about how the leading ensemble addresses the absences — of family, faith, purpose — that dwell inside. It’s perhaps one of the most intense and arguably bleak “Star Wars” pictures yet, but naturally, it strives to find balance as well. In the pursuit of providing some buoyancy to the picture, Johnson wields comedy like a sword, but it’s unfortunately the weakest element of the film. “Star Wars” has always been home to plenty of cornball one liners, and comedic passages, but there’s a delicacy to how they’re employed and delivered that allows them to land….or simply fall flat. Far too often, it’s the latter outcome in this picture, with some of the laughs feeling underwritten or simply shoehorned in. There’s a distinct lack of cleverness to the wit employed here — think something as seemingly spontaneous as BB-8’s “thumbs up” in ‘The Force Awakens’ — and while the gags don’t grind the picture to a halt, there are certainly some awkward patches where the expected laughs don’t materialize. That necessary casual touch is better handled when it comes to introducing new creatures (yes, including the porgs and crystal foxes, which feel organically integrated, and are thankfully used with discretion) and even the new characters. Laura Dern’s steely Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo brings a necessary, new dynamic to the storyline she becomes involved with. As for Benicio del Toro’s riotously weird DJ, his role in the film also becomes illustrative to the broader picture. Working on his biggest canvas yet, Johnson — who has never been short on ambition — makes the most of the huge sandbox he gets to play in. The Monte Carlo-esque Canto Bight sees the director playfully reference the silent classic “Wings” as he introduces the audience to this playground for the galaxy’s wealthy citizens, while building a new setting that will be worth returning to and exploring in further detail in subsequent instalments. Visually, it’s not hyperbole to say that ‘The Last Jedi’ serves up a strong handful of iconic images that will be defining moments in the franchise. The same applies to some of the action sequences, which are aided by Johnson’s fingerprints as he finds dazzling new ways to stage battles after seven movies in the saga. Working with his longtime cinematographer Steve Yedlin, Johnson expands the visual language of the franchise, sometimes with breathtaking results. As for the score, it’s needless to say that John Williams’ work is strong; it’s part of the fabric of the series, but even having done this a while now, there are new motifs and angles with which he deepens the historic sonic palette."
"Dec 12, 2017",NEGATIVE," Certainly, we have hardly ever faced a world in worse shape or in greater need of the lyrical, mystical, and common-sensical. There seem to be large and perpetual pockets where fair and sustaining values are more pale than they should be. But when we consider Plato, Strabbo, and the apostles Paul and John, and many others over the centuries, we see that they also wrote about their times as being likewise devoid of proper “management and meaning.” It appears that “culture at edge of utter corruption” and “world at the edge of utter destruction” are two of the oldest themes to be found in stories of the human race. In my editorial, “Frank Herbert’s Star Wars,” I posited that STAR WARS, as contemporary monomyth, might reach the same conclusion that Campbell did in that final chapter of his treatise, in which the Hero transcends the temporary objects of good and evil in deference to the cosmic perspective. Where THE FORCE AWAKENS cribs from STAR WARS (1977), director Rian Johnson repeats the Rebel evacuation plot of the THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.  A tonally-inconsistent mess, it tries to balance callbacks to THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK—Rebels backed into a corner, Jedi training, bad omens—with some truly brilliant ideas, particularly involving Luke, Leia (Carrie Fisher), Rey (Daisy Ridley) and the Force. While the central story concept of THE LAST JEDI, Luke’s Dharmic apotheosis and Rey’s Gnostic enlightenment, is an inspired one, it’s hounded by lopsided execution and a ham-fisted subplot involving Stormtrooper-turned-Rebel Finn (John Boyega) and a maintenance worker, Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran). They must disable a tracking system aboard Supreme Leader Snoke’s (Andy Serkis) ship to evade the Imperial forces and the only man in the galaxy who can help them turns out to be Fenster from THE USUAL SUSPECTS (Benicio Del Toro).  That, I can buy.  What I can’t abide is the sloppy, last-minute romance that emerges out of this unnecessary thirty-five minute digression as if the studio executives decided at the eleventh hour to retain a sequence, otherwise extraneous were it not for the need to make something out of nothing—and the kiss still feels horribly misplaced and selfish, endangering the entire Rebellion because of a crush. Adding insult to injury are two clumsily-doled moments:  A drab, overtly topical pep talk about #TheResistance from Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) and a subtext about war profiteers in an elaborate set piece (going for Bespin by way of the STAR WARS prequels) festooned with champagne goblets—you might call it the One Percent Planet (apologies to Nicholas Meyer).  Maybe if you look hard enough, you might see a monocle-wearing peanut?  The entire bit is unnecessary as it can be slashed down to a single shot in which Fenster, I mean DJ, flips through a catalogue of Rebel and Imperial arms. While the second and third installments of the original STAR WARS trilogy also hopped back and forth across different subplots to bridge the complex and epic span of the Rebellion’s fight against the Empire set in the backdrop of Luke’s personal journey culminating in Darth Vader’s redemption, you always knew where you were in the story and had a chance to breathe before a major shift, like the conductor resting his baton between movements of a symphony. It’s not that Rian Johnson can’t function as a director.  BRICK was an intelligently made film, but his inexperience is overshadowed by the looming weight of the STAR WARS saga and the monocle-wearing peanuts at Disney who might have picked him for the same reason Lucas replaced Irvin Kershner with Richard Marquand for RETURN OF THE JEDI.  A seasoned director and film professor at USC, Irvin Kershner relied on his own wisdom and that of his actors to drive EMPIRE into the densely-packed chapter that cements the whole story together.  This being Johnson’s fourth feature, he’s not teaching classes at USC any time soon. In fairness, and without spoiling anything, I’ll call out two parts that worked well: 1. An ingenious sequence that personifies the Dark Side of the Force as a duality-within-duality of independence and solitude in contrast to the Light’s unity/conformity, and 2. Mark Hamill. Probably one of the most underrated actors of our time, beset by typecasting, a disfiguring injury, and the tendency of fans to misguidedly credit George Lucas with Luke Skywalker’s gravitas, Hamill gracefully balances out the atonality with an acting style informed by Meisner technique, never stretching so far in either direction (the dialogue often vacillates between drama and weirdly-timed wisecracks) as to give the viewer emotional whiplash in spite of Johnson’s best efforts.  Yet even the Moptop Jedi can’t save a plot in which his greatest revelation—that balance lies beyond dogma, institutions, and the very constructs of good and evil—is undermined at the last minute by a walk-back so baffling its logic is almost Trumpian. I am the cleverness in the gambler’s dice.  I am the radiance of all things beautiful.  I am the victory and the struggle for victory.  I am the goodness of those who are good.  I am the scepter of the rulers of men.  I am the wise policy of those who seek victory.  I am the silence of hidden mysteries; and I am the knowledge of those who know.  And know Arjuna that I am the seed of all things that are; and that no being that moves or moves not can ever be without me.  Know that whatever is beautiful and good, whatever has glory and power is only a portion of my own radiance.  But of what help is it to know this diversity?  Know that with one single fraction of my Being I pervade and support the universe.  And know that I AM."
"Dec 12, 2017",NEGATIVE," I am not particularly invested in the Star Wars franchise. I like the Original Trilogy but I did not grow up with an attachment to it so I know Franchise Fred’s is not the approval  they’re looking for.  Still, it should not be this hard to make a movie I like. It’s about people in space shooting lasers and fighting with swords made of pure light. Franchise Fred disapproves The Last Jedi. Every moment where The Last Jedi almost takes a bold risk for the series, it undermines itself to maintain the status quo. To a certain degree, I get it. As a fan of other franchises, I don’t like it when they make big paradigm shifts just to be different. But when I love a franchise as much as Star Wars fans love this, I do want to see creative permutations. So if you just want to see more space missions, The Last Jedi comes up with new ones. Perhaps if it were only trying to be an action movie, it would be entertaining enough. However, The Last Jedi really wants us to be as invested in Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Kylo Ren’s (Adam Driver) stories as we were Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) in the original trilogy. The amount of time The Last Jedi spends building up to character moments, only to have them back out of actual growth, weighs down the adventure. Remember how Yoda fighting Count Dooku in Attack of the Clones blew everybody’s mind so much it made them forget that the preceding movie was Attack of the Clones. Now we’re used to seeing Yoda fight so it’s no longer enough to convince us that Attack of the Clones was good. The “Whoa” moments of The Last Jedi will eventually fade too and we’ll be left with the actual story of the movie. There is less fan service by volume than The Force Awakens but the moments of fan service are much bigger. It’s not just seeing the Millennium Falcon emerge from the sand. Now it’s a major plot point hinging on the old thing. I found the self-referential humor of The Force Awakens distractingly uncharacteristic for the series. Now I suppose it’s become characteristic and people like it. I still feel pulled out of a galaxy far, far away when they start to talk like modern day people. It’s going to date these movies hard once the slang changes in another decade or two. Slapstick is a little more universal. There’ve always been mishaps and pratfalls through time eternal. There are some bright spots in The Last Jedi. Fans who have been waiting to see the further adventures of Luke Skywalker will be pleased to see him exhibit some moments of badass nonchalance. The red salt planet is a cool visual. Benicio del Toro has a fun character. But there are just as many empty spectacles. At one point there’s a green screen chase with the characters riding CGI creatures, so it’s not very engaging. Perhaps The Last Jedi is intended for kids who have not seen thousands of movies with the same story before. That’s bogus because it’s obviously intended for 40-somethings who grew up with the originals too, but let’s stay on that track for a paragraph. Even if it’s only for the kids, it’s still kids who have seen eight other Star Wars movies before. I suppose as a kid I was never blessed to have a franchise nine movies deep to complain about. Those are champagne Franchise Fred problems, but I would have caught on by part three or four that all they’re doing is going back and forth with an empire and a rebellion over and over and over again. Even the most formulaic James Bond movies have a different maniac with a different plan to take over the world and James Bond has different gadgets to stop him. The Last Jedi will teach kids that there are better solutions than flying off to war guns blazing. That is a valuable message. It just won’t teach them good narrative. Ultimately, it’s not a big deal if I don’t like a Star Wars movie. It would’ve been a pleasant surprise if I had, but I’m glad the people who live for Star Wars are happy. I’ve got my James Bond, Rocky, and Furious franchises. If anyone is to be blamed, it’s Rian Johnson. Disney gave carte blanche to the directors to shape this as well as they can. He wrote and directed this. And this is what we get. A completely neutered story that by the end is back to square one. Star Wars always had humor in them and it works but in this one, it was clunkily executed and quite infantile. The sad thing is he was perfect to make a “dark” Movie kind like Empire strikes back, looper was such a good movie and then he makes this mess??
The only time star wars forced us with humor is when they introduced Jar Jar, and we all know how that worked out. I also agree completely with you, especially on the distracting modern humor and language. Five minutes into it, I was shrinking down into my seat thinking, ‘oh no, not another Ragnarok!’ DX I am very, very disappointed in this movie, and I saw the original in 1977, as a teen. So…I remember when SW was good. 100% agree, I think in time it will come out that the director and/or authors wanted to use this movie to turn the whole franchise upside down, the breadcrumbs are all there in the first half of the movie, but someone intervened and turned it into a run of the mill star wars film. That’s why I was angry about this episode in particular.  They actually set the stage to do something different yet ended up right back with the same old conflicts every single other installment explored."

 Last month, Disney and Lucasfilm announced they hired “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” writer/director Rian Johnson to create a trilogy following “new characters from a corner of the galaxy that “Star Wars” lore has never before explored.” It was a remarkable vote of confidence given that “The Last Jedi” was still weeks away from its public debut. After watching “The Last Jedi,” it’s much easier to understand the Mouse House’s unbridled enthusiasm. Johnson pulled off an amazing feat by recapturing the spirit of the original trilogy while pushing the storyline into unexpected, occasionally jaw-dropping, new places. It’s smart, at times funny and quite deft at inserting humanity and subtle shades of moral ambiguity into a series that often paints emotions and motivations with the broadest of strokes. Much of the pleasure in watching the film comes from its surprises, so this review steers clear of any major spoilers. I’d highly recommend those hoping to experience it in a relatively pure form see it sooner rather than later. “The Last Jedi” is the sort of film that begs for post-screening discussion, and it’s likely to inspire a level of passion not seen in “Star Wars” fandom since 1980’s “The Empire Strikes Back.” (And, yes, you can take that to mean it’s the finest “Star Wars” film since “Empire.” Plenty of critics are going to make that claim, and they’re right.) “The Last Jedi” picks up where 2015’s “The Force Awakens” left off. Rey (Daisy Ridley) has tracked down the reclusive Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to the oceanic planet Ahch-To to enlist his help in battling the First Order, its Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and high-ranking member Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Writer/director J.J. Abrams helped return “Star Wars” to the forefront of pop culture consciousness with “The Force Awakens,” after creator George Lucas’ dull, divisive prequel trilogy killed off much of the public’s affinity for the franchise. Abrams reminded people why they fell for the story in the first place and brought back the wide-eyed magic of the first three films. Related Articles

But Abrams also earned criticism for drawing too much inspiration from the original “Star Wars,” to the point that “The Force Awakens” felt more like a remake with a more diverse cast of characters. And, to be clear, “The Last Jedi” often recalls “Empire,” including plots about Jedi training and parental revelation and the return of the iconic AT-AT Walkers. Benicio del Toro’s character DJ even feels like a rebooted Han Solo. What makes Johnson’s work so powerful is that he happily leads the audience down a seemingly familiar path, but then yanks them away into uncharted territory. Picky hardcore fans are surely going to bemoan some of his creative choices, but most viewers will be thrilled by what, at times, is akin to riding a roller coaster while wearing a blindfold. Johnson also coaxes some amazing performances from Ridley, Driver and John Boyega (Finn) while letting Carrie Fisher — wearing what could pass for haute couture Armani — shine in what turned out to be her final big-screen role. He also created the terrific new character Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), a spunky maintenance crew worker turned devoted Resistance warrior. “The Last Jedi” also continues the warm, organic look of “The Force Awakens” that stands in stark contrast to the clinical, computer-generated blight that was the prequel trilogy. The stunning sequence set at the gambling resort city of Canto Bight delivers equally dazzling decadence and destruction as well as pointed criticism about cruelty to animals. Johnson saturates the Supreme Leader Snoke scenes with an operatic intensity that borders on camp, in the best possible way. “Star Wars” films have always offered some laughs along the way, but Johnson’s jokes are sharper and shrewder than those of his predecessors, particularly the ham-fisted Lucas. At one point, he throws in a visual gag that could be interpreted as a nod to Mel Brooks’ 1987 parody “Spaceballs.” Some viewers will hate the introduction of porgs, a sea bird species that looks like a cross between a puffin and a sloth and exists largely to sell boatloads of merchandise. (After Monday’s press screening of “The Last Jedi,” I stopped by the Disney Store at the Mall of America to find it was sold out of porg plush stuffed animals.) At 152 minutes, “The Last Jedi” runs long, with a bit too much time spent on Ahch-To. And Hamill — who shares the weathered, lion-like look of modern-day Robert Plant — turns in a true love-it-or-hate-it portrayal of an aged Skywalker. Really, though, those are minor quibbles at best. Disney found a true “Star Wars” champion in Johnson and I’m eager to see what he does when he’s able to craft the next trilogy from scratch."
"Dec 12, 2017",NEUTRAL," There's an ultra-cool light-saber fight scene in ""The Last Jedi,"" the latest edition in the Disney marketing colossus known as ""Star Wars,"" that might make even the more ambivalent moviegoers sit up and take notice. Set amid the minimalist expanse of the evil Supreme Leader Snoke's red lair, the kinetic choreography comes close to fulfilling the promise of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" which briefly featured martial-arts stars Iko Uwais and Cecep Arif Rahman but did absolutely nothing with them. Score one for director/writer Rian Johnson (""Looper,"" ""The Brothers Bloom"") who is making his first of what may end up being several ""Star Wars"" films. That's not to say the rest of ""The Last Jedi"" isn't without its many pleasures, even if it sticks to the formula. In fact, it's a worthy follow-up to ""The Force Awakens"" in 2015 - last year's ""Rogue One"" was more of a stand-alone story set in the same universe - and, if you're a fan, there's a lot to chew on. (If you're not a fan, well, ""The Last Jedi"" at least gives you a 152-minute break from Christmas shopping.) There's the return of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and the answer to the question of just what has he been doing alone on that island all this time. There's tug of war between earnest Skywalker protege Rey (Daisy Ridley) and tormented First Order bad boy Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), both learning to come to grips with their use of The Force. Sensing a man who deep down knows he needs a moral makeover, she wants to lure him to the light. Sensing a young soul who can be manipulated and molded, he wants to drag her down deep into the dark. ""The Last Jedi"" starts where ""The Force Awakens"" left off with the rebels of the resistance once again on the run with the First Order - the heirs of the Empire - in hot pursuit. Our scrappy and gallant heroes - Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) - are bringing their best run-and-gun A-game while Rey has been sent to find Luke, who really is the last Jedi in the universe, to get his light-saber out of mothballs and ride to the rescue. But he's not having it. Meanwhile, Kylo - who more than met his match against Rey last time around - is determined to squash the rebels once and for all as he wants to get back in the good graces of Snoke (Andy Serkis, unrecognizable as always). That's going to take some work though. ""You're no Vader,"" Snoke says derisively at one point to Kylo. ""You're just a child in a mask."" Ouch, that's gotta hurt. Along the way, there are some notable guest appearances, such as Benicio del Toro as a stuttering intergalactic thief, Laura Dern as resistance vice admiral Amilyn Holdo and Justin Theroux in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it role as a gambler and code-breaker in this movie's riff on the famous cantina scene. (There must be a lot more of him on the electronic cutting-room floor.) The soldiers of th eFirst Order, like the Empire before them, still can't hit the side of a barn if it were 500-feet tall and lit up like a Christmas tree. Plus, they've built a dreadnaught ship with no adequate means to fully defend it. These guys continue to be the most incompetent empire that ever empired. So, of course, you don't need a weatherman to know which way this particular wind is blowing. But that doesn't mean ""The Last Jedi"" isn't a fun ride, from the opening gag that Poe pulls on the odious and militantly ineffective General Hux (Domnhall Gleeson) to the final First Order vs. Resistance face-off. To his credit, Johnson doesn't let the pace lag often and even introduces the cute, cuddly bird-like creatures called the porgs without bringing to mind previous ""Star Wars"" creature misfires like the wretched Jar Jar Binks. As the third installment in the rebooted franchise and the second in this story arc, ""The Last Jedi"" may not possess its immediate predecessors' pleasant shock of the new, nor is it a stylistic detour from what's expected.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," One by one, the keepers of our era’s biggest franchises, the sacred texts to be drawn on and embellished for generations to come, have had the same bright idea: What if, instead of hiring seasoned hacks or promising but untested newcomers, they gave the movies to actual filmmakers? And one by one, they’ve decided that talent and vision ultimately aren’t worth the hassle. More often than not, the directors who have thrived in the expanded franchiseverse—Marvel’s (and now DC’s) Joss Whedon, Harry Potter’s David Yates, Star Wars’ J.J. Abrams—come out of television, where established forms are, sometimes brilliantly, tinkered with rather than reinvented, and artistic whims are no match for the forward march of the daily schedule. Rian Johnson has proven himself the rare director who can flourish in both worlds, whether he’s following time-traveling hitmen in Looper or chronicling Walter White’s downfall on Breaking Bad, and his induction into the Star Wars universe was both strange—you’re handing Luke and Leia to the guy who made The Brothers Bloom?—and promising. But as The Last Jedi approached, Lucasfilm head Kathleen Kennedy’s faith in individual expression seemed to falter. Gareth Edwards’ Rogue One was heavily reshot by another director, and The Lego Movie’s Phil Lord and Chris Miller were removed from the forthcoming Han Solo movie altogether, replaced by old hand Ron Howard. The Last Jedi made Johnson the only person outside of George Lucas to have sole writing and directing credit on a Star Wars movie, but there was still the worrisome possibility that we might end up with a story directed, no matter how well, by committee. It took only a single scene for The Last Jedi to allay that worry completely. The movie opens, as all Star Wars movies must, with the iconic text crawl and (usually downward) camera tilt across a field of stars, but no sooner has it done that than it seems to be rushing toward a group of evil First Order ships floating in space. There’s a battle brewing, but instead of an opposing fleet, the Order’s General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson, looking like he’s at the end of a prodigious coke bender) is met by a single fighter piloted by the Resistance’s Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac, looking just fine). Hux is full of blood and thunder, but his portentous speeches about crushing his enemies stick in his throat when he’s addressing a tiny audience. As Hux tries to make Poe quake in his boots, Poe impishly pretends to have trouble with his communicator, and the more he pretends, the more Hux’s intimidating patter turns to sputtering, impotent rage. Two minutes into the space opera, and we’ve paused for a comedy routine. The Last Jedi is the first Star Wars movie to be influenced by Spaceballs. Johnson brings to The Last Jedi a cinephile’s erudition as well as a geek’s devotion, and he’s made a film that connects to Star Wars at the root—not just the first movie, but the ones that inspired it. There’s Kurosawa in it, both the rowdy fabulism of The Hidden Fortress and the impressionist choreography of Ran, a sword fight in a scarlet throne room that draws on Powell and Pressburger’s Tales of Hoffman, even an overt nod to Sam Peckinpah’s The Wild Bunch. Abrams’ The Force Awakens was a canny feat of fan service, introducing a new slate of characters while sticking close enough to the original film’s elements that you could practically see its skeleton under the skin. But The Last Jedi isn’t content to revive past glories or re-establish a valuable piece of intellectual property’s commercial viability. There are moments in it that feel genuinely new, not just for the world of Star Wars but the universe of movies as a whole. The Force Awakens ended with its characters dispersed, and in classic middle-film fashion, The Last Jedi spends much of its length getting the band back together. Rey (Daisy Ridley) struggles to convince a disillusioned Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) that the Jedi faith still has a contribution to make toward galactic harmony. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) vies with Hux for the attentions of Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and struggles with his own internal allegiances. The trigger-happy Poe tries to persuade Laura Dern’s Vice Admiral Holdo to take the fight to the First Order instead of playing defense. And Finn joins with Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose, an enthusiastic grease monkey whom fate promotes to key player, on a journey to retrieve a key element in the Resistance’s defense strategy. And there are stretches in the middle of the movie when the effort to keep its various plots moving at the same rate weighs all of them down: It’s like watching a midseason Game of Thrones episode where the only thing the various stories have in common is that they’re at the same points in their arcs. But the movie never allows plot mechanics to triumph over visual poetry for too long. You don’t have to be invested in who is taking what where to be brought up short by the consistently striking, sometimes even startling, images Johnson and his longtime cinematographer, Steve Yedlin, have put up on the screen. At 43, Johnson isn’t much younger than Abrams, but even more than The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi feels like a passing of the torch. Unlike Harrison Ford’s perpetually jaunty Han Solo, Mark Hamill’s Luke is worn down by the time that’s passed between trilogies, bent double by the weight of his own failure. (Finally someone acknowledges that the Jedi’s long-term track record is not a great one.) Despite the fact that Carrie Fisher died after filming was completed, Johnson has left her story, pointing to a now-impossible role in Episode IX, intact, but her every appearance is tinged with a hint of fragile mortality, and Luke’s last words to Leia now serve as an inadvertent but perfectly bittersweet farewell. Alongside them has risen a new, more diverse cast of universe-savers, one that feels both out of time and perfectly of their moment. Luke was a hot-rodder born of Lucas’ ’50s childhood, and though gearhead Rose and flyboy Poe share some of his DNA, when Poe steers his fighter into a 180-degree slide, I thought not of American Graffiti but The Fast and the Furious. They’re a generation born into an unending war that may never really be won, that knows that evil can be kept at bay but never defeated. Without the responsibility of beginning a trilogy or ending one, Johnson has the freedom to steer The Last Jedi into murkier moral waters—including a scene where it’s revealed that the war profiteers Finn and Rose have been tracking down sell to both First Order and Resistance alike. Though the movie doesn’t vindicate the cynical idea that there’s no difference between sides, it does raise the question of whether it’s possible to win a war and lose oneself in the process. Like many before it, The Last Jedi has already been hailed as the best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back, and while that’s true, it’s too faint a compliment. It’s a film of genuine beauty, one where you come away as eager to talk about the set design and the choreography as you do the fate of the galaxy or what might happen next. The “true burden of all masters,” a character observes at one point, is for their students to grow beyond them.* It’s a burden that George Lucas now bears, and one hopes he bears it smiling."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Rebellions require heroes — even deeply flawed ones. That notion has always been at the heart of Star Wars, with its bevy of lovably imperfect good guys (and gals), but The Last Jedi elevates it to the level of grandeur, delivering a rousing, stirring adventure which is consistently guided by the courage and fallibility of its characters. The rare franchise sequel whose chief weakness is the breadth of its ambition, the film sometimes struggles to juggle its myriad storylines and character arcs, but much is forgiven in the wake of a sustained, riveting finale that overpowers any quibbles about pacing and plotting. Opening across most of the globe by December 15, this Disney juggernaut will be attempting to rival The Force Awakens ($2.1 billion worldwide) and franchise spinoff Rogue One ($1.1 billion) during the current holiday season. The Last Jedi may not feature Harrison Ford’s Han Solo, but the brand’s seeming commercial invincibility should remain unchallenged. The film takes place shortly after The Force Awakens, as General Leia (the late Carrie Fisher) and her Resistance try to outrun the evil First Order, led by General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) and the brooding Kylo Ren (a nicely nuanced Adam Driver). Meanwhile, aspiring Jedi Rey (Daisy Ridley) meets with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who now lives in exile, in the hopes of convincing him to combat the forces of evil one more time. Taking the reins from Force Awakens filmmaker J.J. Abrams, writer-director Rian Johnson has fashioned a confident, vibrant widescreen entertainment that will appeal to Star Wars diehards while also developing the slew of characters introduced in the previous movie — not to mention creating new ones, such as Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), a no-nonsense, low-level grunt in the Resistance. It’s inevitable that nostalgia and fan service will creep into the proceedings, but what’s commendable about The Last Jedi is how few of the allusions are blatant references but, rather, thoughtful homages to the original trilogy’s themes of heroism, selflessness and resilience. In his previous films, such as Brick and Looper, Johnson adeptly worked within genres while also flashing irreverent humour and a sneaky cleverness that dodged and weaved around conventions. From its familiar John Williams music to its trademark opening crawl, this is profoundly a Star Wars movie; but Johnson shows little strain within the creative straitjacket that such an undertaking demands — especially in how he both satisfies and subverts the assumptions viewers might have that the movie will be the darker, more despairing Empire Strikes Back to Force Awakens’ relatively cheerful A New Hope. Much of the fun of The Last Jedi comes from its surprises, which shouldn’t be spoiled, but it’s no accident that this is the longest Star Wars film considering that it focuses on more than half a dozen crucial characters. Among those are John Boyega’s hesitant Finn, who has no love for the First Order but remains unconvinced that the Resistance can triumph, and Oscar Isaac’s hot-headed, bighearted Poe, whose instinct to take any risk for the good of the Resistance might get him killed. Johnson complicates the relationships between established characters, taking his time setting up parallel narrative threads so that we fully understand the emotional undercurrents that will eventually lead to cathartic action sequences. Those threads aren’t always well-drawn, but even when the story drags the movie remains engaging because of the cast’s commitment to the story’s underlying message. Whether it’s the weary veteran warrior Luke Skywalker or the fresh-faced Rey (played again with raw vitality by Ridley), many of the film’s central figures must contend with their own failings, discovering that wanting to be noble isn’t enough and that sometimes the most difficult choice is the only option. If the original Star Wars portrayed good and evil in clear-cut terms, The Last Jedi ponders the thin line between those extremes — as well as how heroism is often little more than a best guess undertaken by uncertain individuals. The film’s occasional sluggishness gives way in its final reels, erupting in one propulsive sequence after another that melds spectacle and emotion. Working with production designer Rick Heinrichs, long-time cinematographer Steve Yedlin and a fleet of effects personnel, Johnson has crafted an overstuffed but visually striking epic that consistently articulates what remains mythic and riveting about George Lucas’s 40-year-old franchise. The space battles and lightsaber duels are appropriately exciting, but Johnson keeps a close eye on the human element that girds this galactic odyssey. Rather than simply regurgitating Star Wars’ past, The Last Jedi emphatically builds on it. Screen International is the essential resource for the international film industry.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Early into The Last Jedi, the zippy, operatic, and occasionally exhilarating new Star Wars movie, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) smashes his helmet into pieces. It’s chiefly a symbolic act: Kylo, who established his volcanic temper as the formidable new heavy of The Force Awakens, is determined to “let the past die”—to emerge from the shadow of his infamous grandfather, to shake the Vader comparisons he once courted and make the galaxy far, far away forget all about the fallen Jedi with the basso profondo and the beetle-black armor. But is there a promise, too, in the shattered remains of that villainous headwear? After two “new” Star Wars movies inextricably linked to the 1977 original, perhaps letting the past die isn’t the worst route for this series to take. Written and directed by Rian Johnson (Looper, Brick), The Last Jedi is a middle chapter in most of the right ways. Unburdened by the necessity for introductions or tying up loose ends, it operates in a rollicking present tense, never stopping to catch its breath as it races through two and a half hours of running time. This isn’t a nostalgia trip through another film’s highlights, à la the franchise reset J.J. Abrams offered two years ago, though as the second episode in a new trilogy, it does contain perhaps inevitable echoes of The Empire Strikes Back: a battle on an ice-covered planet that’s basically Hoth, complete with slowly stomping, dinosaurian AT-AT Walkers; a plot that splits up the characters, sending one of them to some far-flung locale for secret training sessions; and even the repeat of a certain punchline. More than replicating the specifics of Empire, The Last Jedi preserves its general values, its spectacle and mysticism and downbeat Shakespearean drama. We pick up where The Force Awakens left off: with the resistance, led by General Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher), back on the defensive, evading destruction at the hands of The First Order. The impossibly British General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) has found a way to track the rebels through hyper-speed, meaning that the good guys have to constantly keep leaping to safety—an idea that recalls the first episode of the Battlestar Galactica reboot. (Given the supposed, litigated influence the original Star Wars had on the original Battlestar, perhaps we’ll call this a friendly case of sci-fi symbiosis.) With fuel running low, reformed Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) sets out on a risky, multi-step mission to disable the enemy’s tracking device, an uneasy new comrade from the engine room (Kelly Marie Tran) in tow. Meanwhile, on a secluded island somewhere else in space, Rey (Daisy Ridley, terrific again) slowly convinces a grizzled, hermetic Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to train her, the way a miniature Zen master with jumbled syntax once trained him. Those who go in expecting the knotty unpredictability of Looper will be disappointed. Johnson is operating firmly within the Lucasfilm framework; narratively speaking, he’s playing with, not transcending, the ancient hero’s-journey template of the series. Yet The Last Jedi gets some new life out of those conventions. The meat of the story is on that island, as Luke—looking more like Alec Guinness’ Obi-Wan Kenobi than ever—reluctantly schools Rey in the ways of light, darkness, and the eternal balancing act between them. But this may be the first Star Wars movie that makes the dangerous allure of the dark side feel like more than a vague, unconvincing threat. Much of that comes down to the script’s one brilliant innovation: a kind of involuntary psychic communion between Rey and Kylo Ren, whose opposing positions in the cosmic struggle don’t prevent them from developing a certain tense chemistry. If it was hard to ever buy that Luke could actually be coaxed to the dark side by a deep-breathing cyborg autocrat, Driver’s oddly sympathetic performance almost seduces you into believing that souls are actually at stake. It’s a real relationship, this love-hate bond between two offspring of the old world. Perhaps even more so than Gareth Edwards, who made last year’s bracingly bleak Star Wars prequel/spinoff Rogue One, Johnson rises to the occasion of mega-budget, space-opera blockbustering. It’s clear from the opening set piece that he has a three-dimensional, inside-out grasp of space, both outer and otherwise: The sequence deftly mingles coherent CGI spectacle—the usual diving, dogfighting spacecrafts, whose movements across the inky black canvas never grow impossible to track—with the tactile human dilemmas happening simultaneously, like a nerve-wracking development involving an out-of-reach remote and a cache of explosives. Johnson’s imagery, too, is grand and mythic: a brilliant crack of light cleaving a giant spacecraft in two; a lightsaber frozen in midair, pulled by equalizing forces of telekinetic concentration; and a truly awe-inspiring scene featuring starfighters with trails of bright-red salt pluming behind them, like the gaseous flairs in Mad Max: Fury Road or something you might see in the colorful, patriotic big-screen pageants of Zhang Yimou. From the Coen-ish noir hijinks of Brick to the Andersonian whimsy of The Brothers Bloom to the Terminator time-travel gymnastics of Looper, Johnson has built a career riffing on and rearranging the stuff that’s sparked his imagination—he’s a gifted remix auteur. That makes him an unlikely but natural fit for Star Wars, which was conceived as a hodgepodge of classic tropes and images. After Force Awakens, whose only real point of visual and conceptual reference was A New Hope (Abrams did get the texture down), The Last Jedi reintroduces genre-hopping to the series’ bag of tricks. The new trilogy’s answer to The Emperor, Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis, completely unrecognizable under his motion-capture performance), delivers orders from a throne room guarded by warriors in boxy red samurai armor, while Luke’s island paradise is a menagerie of hilarious movie critters (including, yes, the screaming Porgs, whose plush-doll cuteness is amusingly undercut by their sole function as a source of irritation to Chewbacca). The film also makes an extended pit stop at a seedy casino town that’s like Casablanca meets the Mos Eisley Cantina, though it turns out to be one of the few aspects of the film that feels underdeveloped: all nattering CGI clientele, no ambience. One of the things that separates the new Star Wars films from George Lucas’ prequels is the wealth of likable personalities, and the general absence of solemn, tariff-discussing Jedi bores. (Even the most spiritually enlightened of these folks, like Hamill’s wizened disciple-turned-master, have wry senses of humor.) Yes, Han Solo is gone, but his essence seems to have been dispersed among the freshman cast. There’s a little of his arrogance in flyboy Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), who takes up the sparring-with-Leia duties; his everyman-among-space-prophets exasperation in Finn (though, to its discredit, The Last Jedi misplaces some of the nervous bumble Boyega got to exhibit in Force Awakens); and his mercenary I’m-just-here-to-get-paid selfishness in Benicio Del Toro’s new addition, a shady, stuttering hacker brought along for the ride. As for the inevitable reunion between the film’s anchoring franchise veterans, it’s perhaps even more simply poignant than the one Force Awakens arranged, in part because we’re seeing some of Fisher’s final acting.  “They blow you up today, you blow them up tomorrow,” Del Toro’s opportunistic anti-hero says at one point during the film’s extended roller-coaster finale. It’s The Last Jedi’s way of acknowledging the cyclicality of Star Wars, and how awfully convenient it is, for franchising purposes, that there’s always a new generation of light and dark recruits to keep The Force in balance. The Last Jedi, like The Force Awakens and Rogue One before it, isn’t perfect popcorn entertainment: It sags a little in the middle, during that protracted misadventure in space-Morocco, and doesn’t always juggle its multiple storylines with the grace of, yes, The Empire Strikes Back. But by the rousing final act, Johnson has brought an apocalyptic grandeur to the lightsaber duels and airborne combat. His often-stirring addition to the saga finally lands on an affecting point about the importance of preserving essential cultural tradition without clinging too strictly to the dogma—and the texts—of the old way. In that philosophy, contrasting hard with the burn-it-all-down zealotry of Kylo Ren, Star Wars locates a promising path forward: old virtues, new cool."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,Fans can expect plenty of surprises and awe-inspiring visual wizardry.
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,After this - I never thought I'd say it - I'm up for more. Bring on the next Star Wars.
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"The first half of the movie works in fits and starts, but Johnson makes up for it in the second, when the bundle of subplots intertwine tighter, and the narrative rockets forward, its action fleet of foot and tightly tied to its emotional highs."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," I’m being vague here on purpose. Suffice to say that, despite being comprised of variations on things we’ve been experiencing directly (in “Star Wars” films) and indirectly (in “Star Wars”-inspired entertainment) since 1977, “The Last Jedi” still manages to maneuver in unexpected ways, starting with the decision to build a whole film around a retreat where the goal is not to win but to avoid being wiped out.   Along that narrative backbone “The Last Jedi” strings what amount to several tight, often hastily devised mini-missions, each of which either moves the heroes (or villains) closer to their goals or blows up in their faces. The story resolves in lengthy, consecutive climaxes which, refreshingly, don’t play like a cynical attempt to pad things out. Old business is resolved, new business introduced.  Sometimes ""The Last Jedi"" violates our expectations in a cheeky way that stops short of telling super-fans to get over themselves. There’s a touch of “Spaceballs” and “Robot Chicken” to some of the jokes. Snoke orders Kylo to “take off that ridiculous helmet,” Luke chastises an old friend for showing a nostalgic video by muttering “That was a cheap move,” and an early gag finds one of the heroes calling the bridge of a star destroyer and pretending to be stuck on hold. This aspect adds a much-needed dash of self-deprecating humor (“The Force Awakens” was often a stitch as well, especially when Han Solo, Chewbacca, BB-8 and John Boyega’s James Garner-like hero/coward Finn were onscreen), but without going so meta that ""The Last Jedi"" turns into a smart-alecky thesis paper on itself.  The movie works equally well as an earnest adventure full of passionate heroes and villains  and a meditation on sequels and franchise properties. Like “The Force Awakens,” only more so, this one is preoccupied with questions of legacy, legitimacy and succession, and includes multiple debates over whether one should replicate or reject the stories and symbols of the past. Among its many valuable lessons is that objects have no worth save for the feelings we invest in them, and that no individual is greater than a noble idea.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"[Rian] Johnson's passion ends up giving wings to these last Jedi who, although wounded and disenchanted, resist stronger than ever. [Full Review in Spanish]"
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," If 2015’s “The Force Awakens” was a righting of wrongs, burying the memory of those dreadful prequel films, then “The Last Jedi” is the new “Star Wars” trilogy fully coming into its own. Director Rian Johnson (”Looper”) has fashioned a grand and heartfelt epic with something for everyone, whether you’re here for the new heroes such as Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega), or the old ones (welcome back, Mark Hamill!), or just for the X-wing dogfights; whether you’re in need of some rousing inspiration, or longing for one last visit with Carrie Fisher, the series’ beloved Princess Leia, who died last year. What’s more, Johnson’s done this all with a middle film, the heaviest lift in any trilogy. While there are elements nodding to “The Empire Strikes Back” — the second and best of the original three — “The Last Jedi” is no copycat. In its most daring moments, it even tweaks a few series tropes, updating them with a decidedly populist kick. As in “Empire,” there’s a large swath of plot devoted to the meeting of a reclusive Jedi master and an aspiring student. Luke Skywalker (Hamill) has become the cranky hermit, Rey his cocky supplicant. Hamill, often written off as a weak link in the old series, gives a wonderfully melancholy performance: weary, haunted and unwilling to accept the mantle of “legend” that Rey wants to bestow on him. The tiny green island he calls home is almost a character all its own, populated with a range of alien creatures. Chief among them are porgs, huge-eyed and oft-outraged shore birds who make a good argument for the strategic use of top-notch special effects. They are — sorry, “Return of the Jedi” loyalists — the anti-Ewoks, in a good way. Petulant First Order leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), wearing the facial scars of his “Force Awakens” duel with Rey, continues his quest for domination via the Force — and the occasional temper tantrum. Driver and Domhnall Gleeson as General Hux, his second in command, are a perfectly pitched terrible two, genuinely scary (Driver’s glare does seem like it could move inanimate objects) and amusingly inept. Kylo and Rey unwittingly connect again and again, moving toward an unavoidable confrontation spurred by the Voldemort-like Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). Watching these two face off is a thrill, one about which I can say no more. A fundamental problem plagues all “Star Wars” movies, which is that the overarching story is one of scrappy rebels being endlessly chased around the galaxy by bad guys with more funds and better tech. Johnson can’t escape this repetitive cycle: The Resistance mounts an attack, the First Order fires back, Resistance retreats, First Order rubs its hands together evilly and plots its next, bigger response. Thankfully, the cast is so likable and the action so well-shot, you don’t mind too much. Pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), aided by his droid pal BB-8, hatches one daring, harebrained scheme after another, only to be smacked down by an evolving rebel matriarchy. Alongside Fisher’s General Leia, Laura Dern is resplendent in violet hair as the steel-nerved Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo. Former Stormtrooper Finn, meanwhile, is on a code-breaking mission that teams him with rebel engineer Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) on a trip to “a terrible place, filled with the worst people in the galaxy.” This is a long-running galactic dive bar joke (recall Mos Eisley of “A New Hope”), but the twist here is that it’s a gilded casino packed with high-rolling weapons dealers. Finn and Rose’s wild chase through a glittering ballroom on the backs of liberated racing beasts points to Johnson’s class-conscious take on the rebel cause. They also intersect with a shifty code-breaker (Benicio del Toro, too briefly) and, apparently, Princes William and Harry in Stormtrooper cameos. It’s a lot of story for even 150 minutes, which never felt long to me. The details are exquisite. A battle in a desert layered with crimson-colored salt is a visually arresting (and PG-13) nod to the bloody reality of warfare; countless emotional reunions and reveals had me reaching for the Kleenex. Sure, it’s just a space Western, but “Star Wars” is one of our most popular modern mythologies. Johnson respects that. He’s infused the storyline with new energy and artistry, and I can’t wait to see it again."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," The Last Jedi opens with one of the funniest bits I’ve ever seen in a Star Wars film and then mostly keeps that lightness of spirit throughout. That’s not unwise for a movie crammed with confrontations and near-escapes and betrayals and counter-betrayals and speeches and mechanical minutiae and climaxes and pseudo-climaxes — a movie in which I’m pretty sure we see, at different points, no fewer than three different characters in comas. Writer-director Rian Johnson has certainly made the busiest Star Wars film of them all, but he keeps it from becoming a slog by infusing it with humor, verve, and visual charm. As with quite a few of these movies, The Last Jedi starts in mid-escape and then keeps the pressure on. Huddled in a few spaceships, the Resistance led by General Leia (Carrie Fisher) finds itself on the verge of capture or destruction by the First Order, that Galactic Empire tribute band, again and again over the course of the film, and what saves them each time is some singularly creative, kamikaze act of bravery. (If there’s one key theme that runs through this movie, it’s that of sacrifice.) Among the desperate are our returning heroes, hotshot pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and recovering ex-stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega), as well as new additions Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), a maintenance worker whose wide-eyed dedication to the Resistance has only been strengthened by the death of her sister during a bombing run, and Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), who assumes power at a moment of crisis and is promptly faced with doubting subordinates. Back among the baddies, concave-faced Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) first harangues General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) for failing to finish off the Resistance and then chastises his impulsive Dark Side protégé Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) for his failure to kill young Jedi-to-be Rey (Daisy Ridley). “Alas, you’re no Vader,” Snoke snarls. “You’re just a child in a mask” — whereupon the younger man petulantly yanks off said mask and smashes it. It’s refreshing to see these villains not as monolithic, sneering, all-powerful beings but as essentially dumb, angry kids, somewhat out of their element: Hux is ambitious and overconfident, Kylo is volatile and conflicted; they piss each other off as much as they piss off the good guys. That’s an inspired, maybe even courageous bit of character development, because it adds interest, texture, and even some humor to their scenes, while sacrificing a degree of menace and urgency. (These imperial buffoons do a lot of damage, but it’s hard to feel scared of them.) Meanwhile, at a remote island on the distant planet of Ahch-To, eager apprentice Rey tries to convince an embittered Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to return to the fight and teach her the ways of the Force. Still scarred from his failed attempt to train a new generation of Jedi — an endeavor that effectively birthed noted psychopath Kylo Ren — Luke is now convinced that the ancient order needs to end. He’s even begun to question whether the Jedi were a force for good to begin with. But my early hope that Johnson might give us a deconstruction of the Jedi’s role as quasi-benign enforcers of state power was for naught; Luke’s main bone of contention with Jedi history appears to be that everything they did wound up in failure, which, well, he’s got a point. As The Force Awakens did with Star Wars, The Last Jedi borrows the rough template of The Empire Strikes Back — proto-Jedi coaxes reluctant master out of retirement and faces his/her greatest fears, while their friends face deadly scrapes elsewhere. But whereas J.J. Abrams seemed content to remix the earlier film, Johnson infuses much of The Last Jedi with his own sensibility. He has more visual style: He shoots space battles with a mixture of freewheeling fluidity and hushed grandeur, and lightsaber battles with both hothouse fervor and graphical mischief; one big fight is filmed against a background so deliriously red you might wonder if you’ve accidentally stepped into an MGM musical or a Michael Powell fever dream. Not unlike James Cameron, Johnson also appears to have an engineer’s mind for story and scene construction, as well as for what-if invention. What would happen if you — and here’s where some mild spoilers start, fanboys — drove a giant ship at hyper-speed straight into an imperial armada? How do tracking devices on star destroyers actually work? If your master can read your mind, how would you conspire against him? That kind of intricately imagined detail adds a pleasing sturdiness to many scenes; they seem to hold to the laws of a real universe as opposed to the demands of blockbuster thermodynamics. There’s proportionality to the film’s thematic arc as well: “When I saw you,” Snoke tells Kylo Ren, “I saw what all masters hope to see — raw, untamed power.” That quote is reflected later, when someone else (I won’t say who!) remarks of Rey, “We are what they grow beyond. That is the true burden of all masters.” The bad guys shape and exploit, the good guys grow and set free. Elements like these echo throughout, lending the whole conceptual elegance. You get the sense that it’s all been sincerely thought through, and not cynically slapped together. A good thing, too, because the story itself, as jam-packed as it is, doesn’t always amount to all that much. Johnson excels at coming up with lots of little things to keep us interested — a plan to access a hyperdrive here, a minor space mutiny there — but the broad, melodramatic passions that originally fueled the Star Wars movies, and helped win them so many fans, don’t register quite as strongly as they did decades ago. But that was a different time, and those were basic, elemental desires — the thwarted passion of lovers, the search to reclaim a child, to redeem a parent. And it’s also true that the saga occasionally overdid it; if George Lucas was guilty of one thing with the prequels, it’s that he sometimes privileged myth over entertainment. Johnson attempts to bring balance to the equation, but has he overcorrected? Put it another way: Should I have felt more during The Last Jedi? Maybe not. Maybe it’s the very briskness of his approach that keeps the heavier emotions at bay. The Last Jedi is a better film than The Force Awakens — it’s faster, funnier, and has both more sweep and more originality — but I still didn’t find any moments here as hauntingly moving as that earlier film’s first flight of the Millennium Falcon, or the death of Han Solo. The good news is that Johnson doesn’t really need them. The Last Jedi is the most entertaining Star Wars movie in many a moon, and that’s more than enough."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," The Star Wars film universe is now three movies deep into its third act — after the original trilogy and the trio of much-maligned prequels — and it’s already clear that this Disney-owned rebirth shows no sign of stopping. Stand-alone films like Rogue One: A Star Wars Story will be the main way forward with both young Han Solo and Obi-Wan Kenobi getting their own upcoming features, but the true heart of the franchise sits in the continuing tale of characters and themes we first met decades ago, in a galaxy far, far away. Star Wars: The Last Jedi hits theaters this weekend, and like 2015’s The Force Awakens, it’s focused as much on building these new characters as it is on saying goodbye to old ones. (Don’t worry — there are no spoilers as to the latter below.) We open on the First Order’s fleet approaching a rebel base intending to destroy it and everyone within. General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) looks on with glee as the destruction begins, but evacuees — including General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) — escape the surface and prepare to jump to safety. The ensuing battle sees pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) risk lives to take out a devastating weapon, and after a quick demotion for his actions the surviving rebels make their light-speed jump. Impossibly, though, the First Order tracks them and begins picking off the already sparse rebel ships. Tough decisions are made, and desperate plans are put into motion as doom draws closer. Elsewhere on a small island on a forgotten planet, Rey (Daisy Ridley) is hoping to convince Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to rejoin the rebels and help kickstart the fight in their favor. His disinterest is palpable, but Rey’s insistence leads him to offer some training and concede the dark truths of what transpired between him and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) years prior. Rey’s training sees her distracted by two things — brief “windows” opening between she and Ren that allows them to see and talk to each other, and a pull towards darkness emanating from beneath the island. The Last Jedi splits its attentions between these two threads, and while one half delivers spectacularly with heart, thrills, and some truly beautiful story beats… the other replaces Rey, Ren, and Luke with a disappointing series of empty action, pointless subplots, and rough dialogue. Happily, what works does so with real wonder and awe as Rey discovers truths about both herself and Luke that alter viewers’ perceptions of their heroes in bold and exciting ways. The two also share some of the film’s sweetest and funniest laughs as writer/director Rian Johnson‘s (Looper) script gives them smartly humorous interactions that they bring warmly to life. The island is a gorgeous locale offering beauty and isolation in equal measure, and its non-human populace is equally engaging with carp-like nuns, a bipedal walrus that Luke lactates for a liquid breakfast — yes, you read that right — and a porg flock that never grows as annoying as their already ubiquitous pop culture presence might have you fearing. Time spent here works well to build characters and themes, and both are strengthened even further in scenes pairing Rey and Ren. Their brief conversations come as she learns that the Force is “the tension, the balance, that binds the universe together” as opposed to a simple breakdown between good and evil, and these threads weave together to form doubts about motivations and the inevitability of character arcs. Ridley and Driver are the beating heart of the film with performances that take hold of viewers’ attention and emotions, and it’s their story-lines that captivate up through and beyond the film’s stunning high point involving torture, anguish, and a mesmerizing fight set-piece. Far less successful is the time spent with the rebels on the run from Hux and the First Order. Not only is it centered on the slowest space chase in sci-fi history, but subplots featuring Poe, Finn (John Boyega), and Rose (newcomer Kelly Marie Tran) go absolutely nowhere. Sure we get introduced to DJ (Benicio Del Toro) and Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), but it’s with actions that fail to connect either through sheer stupidity or the simple truth that their absence wouldn’t change the story in the slightest. They’re obvious filler, and as is the Disney way (witness their Marvel films) the studio’s never met a character that couldn’t be jammed into a movie for no reason other than the misguided belief that more is better. Finn and Rose’s adventure in particular offers some additional action beats and a visit to a casino — think the Mos Eisley Cantina scene from Star Wars, but for the 1% — but it is meaningless noise. The film is a series of points both high and low, and it’s nowhere more clear than in the humor. Several beats work well to bring a smile, but others fall tone deaf to the carnage and pain surrounding them. From the very beginning Hux’s scenes are made to feel like lost reels from Mel Brooks’ Spaceballs, and poor Boyega can’t catch a break as Finn is saddled with lame one-liners at every turn. Some oddly unintelligent choices are made too, often at life-threatening times, and what should be moments of real drama instead leave viewers shaking their heads. One scene late in the film deserves the same scorn heaped upon Charlize Theron’s doomed run from a falling spaceship in Prometheus. Good gravy is it ridiculous. Still, while there’s plenty that disappoints there’s also much to appreciate. As mentioned above, every scene featuring Rey and Ren — both apart and together, but especially together — is electric with energy, tension, and excitement. Luke is nearly as compelling, and Hamill fully embraces his return. As with The Force Awakens, Leia isn’t given all that much to do here, but Fisher’s passing unavoidably adds real weight to her every moment shared with new characters, old characters, and viewers themselves. Johnson and company also craft thrilling action beats throughout, and even when they stumble in their narrative power they still deliver adrenaline rushes and excitement. The Last Jedi continues what Star Wars began and The Force Awakens magnified. It’s a simple story, stretched to lengths but populated with character, beauty, action, and cheese. It may take place in a galaxy far, far away, but once again the message hits home. Don’t fight what you hate, save what you love. To that end there’s more than enough to love here."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," From the first aerial battle to the last explosion, “The Last Jedi” sears the imagination like a red-hot blaster. If the recent “Star Wars” reboot movies have been enjoyable but unexceptional, this one is not just another planet-hopping odyssey. “Jedi” gambles on moments of heart-pounding daring and raw emotion, and it wins big. The fandom is gonna need a bigger lightsaber because “The Last Jedi” is almost as thrilling and memorable as “The Empire Strikes Back.” After suffering through the dreadful Jar Jar Binks period, that’s a sentence this sci-fi fan never thought she’d write. After years of watching the mythology reduced to a mere vehicle to push merchandise, the true “Jedi” spirit is back. The movie is so good, maybe even great, it makes words like epic seem puny. The force is strong with Rian Johnson. The writer-director honors the canon, but he isn’t content to merely imitate it (looking at you, “The Force Awakens”). Instead he aspires for the kind of heady idiosyncrasy and deep emotional truth that animated the original George Lucas films. Freed from the tyranny of trying to please everybody, “Jedi” pulls off the biggest mind trick ever. In a pop culture universe teeming with derivative reboots, “Jedi” actually feels unique. What’s even more surprising is how relevant and potent this sci-fi parable turns out to be. Forty years after the franchise began, it feels like a clarion call for all who would resist the forces of tyranny, and not just the kind found on a Death Star. Indeed there’s more than one screed against greed, particularly war profiteering, that strikes an all too timely chord here. Disney is justified in asking that reviewers avoid spoilers because the fiercest part of this two and a half hour flick, the longest in the Star Wars canon but also one of the most suspenseful, lies in its unpredictability. You may see some things coming of course, such as the chance to say a tearful goodbye to Princess Leia forever (the late great Carrie Fisher in her swan song), but for the most part, you never know where the next jump to hyperspace is going to land you, and that’s flat-out exhilarating. The bones of the plot are already known but the wit embedded in the dialogue comes as a welcome surprise. The promising acolyte Rey (Daisy Ridley) aspires to train with the legendary Luke Skywalker (a grizzled Mark Hamill), to learn the path of the Jedi, amid a looming standoff between the resistance and the dark side, led by the abominable Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and fired by the implacable evil of his protégé, Kylo Ren (played with terrifying intensity by Adam Driver). Reading this on your phone? Stay up to date with our free mobile app. Get it from the Apple app store  or the Google Play store. All who can resist the siege of corruption join forces with Leia, now a battle-tested general, whose ranks include the reformed Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) and cocky flyboy Poe (Oscar Isaac). Alas, nothing is simple in this iteration of the classic. Everyone is deeply flawed, even the heroes. Worst of all, tirelessly fighting the good fight doesn’t always lead to glory. The combat tableaux are as harrowing as they are spectacular. In one scene, so many rebels are slain, the white soil blurs into a river of red. It should be noted that there are a few unnecessarily precious moments that mar the film’s tone of darkness, and the final scenes are a tad overwrought, too blatantly sounding a note of hope. But these are quibbles. “The Last Jedi” has as much heart as it has guts and that’s a stirring combination. You walk out of the cinema reminded why it’s sometimes worth fighting a battle you may well lose. If you are keeping score at home, my ranking of all the Star Wars movies from best to worst now looks like this: “The Empire Strikes Back” still wins, but “The Last Jedi” comes close to the title. Then we have the original, “A New Hope,” and after that I’d put “Return of the Jedi” and “Rogue One.” Movies like “The Phantom Menace,” “Attack of the Clones” and “Revenge of the Sith” take last place. The less said about them, the better."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," The tranquil blue introduction. The boom of the Williams fanfare. The warm yellow crawl. They invite you home to the familiar, a place in the past where wondrous adventures of swashbuckling in a galaxy far, far away came few and far between. They’re comfort incarnate and work without fail – for a time. With the roar of applause that accompanied the top of The Last Jedi’s opening prologue, you’d think the words “Episode VIII” were a complete surprise to those in attendance. Such is the power of Star Wars. These aren’t quite movies anymore as they are an exercise in feeling something – the pangs of nostalgia – and Rian Johnson understands this almost innately throughout The Last Jedi. Saddled with the mammoth and unenviable position of potentially disappointing pop culture’s most volatile of fanbases, Johnson unflinchingly maneuvers these characters with a special cunning. He plays to the crowd from the Star Wars handbook before betraying them wholesale. It’s a daunting task made moreso by the fact that he was teed up with the safe-yet-slapdash precursor of J.J. Abrams’ The Force Awakens. It’s wholly understandable that any sequel to a shameless remake of A New Hope would contain some semblance of The Empire Strikes Back, but where Abrams was cautious and calculated in giving fans exactly what they want, Johnson is bold and clever enough not to. Though there is surely fan service, and those winks and nods are among the worst moments, The Last Jedi, at its best moments, is far more concerned with where this franchise can go as opposed to where it’s been. The confines of the Empire framework are immediately on display. With the Resistance evacuating their base while a First Order blockade howls at their door, and Rey (Daisy Ridley) eager to begin training on a remote planet under a fabled Jedi master, this eighth installment threatens familiarity to a worrisome degree. How fitting, then, that the Brothers Bloom helmer seems to have remembered the beats of the long con. Scene after scene, his better instincts swoop in like the Deus Ex Millenium Falcon to deliver us from stagnance. We’re even taunted by Laura Dern in a thankless role before she does one of the coolest things in franchise history. To name the specifics of these playful subversions would be grounds for execution, but know that for every stale “May the Force be with you” and “Fulfill your destiny,” there is baiting and switching (and Porgs) in bulk. What results is a story that is surprising, if a bit messy. There are so many pieces in play it’s a wonder they all manage to coalesce, let alone complete individual arcs. Johnson’s screenplay follows through oxymoronic patience and urgency. Patience, unfortunately, takes time. At over two-and-a-half hours, the film had me reconsidering if I really needed a Finn v. Phasma fight, or a five-act structure. So consider the urgency. A wordsmith in his own right, Johnson seems to be dumbing himself down here for the sake of the brand. He manages to pose some of the most complex ideas on morality and war this franchise has ever attempted, but is forced to breeze through and cap them off with trite buzzwords. After the umpteenth mention of sparks and fire and hope (all the hope), it’s clear that The Last Jedi desires the patience to linger on the subtext of these complex ambitions but needs to wrap it up in platitudes to avoid a third hour. Its mind is moving faster than its mouth can speak. Again, an unenviable position. The final product is a film all too knowing of its own history. In light of last year’s passing, Carrie Fisher seems to be lingered on in a more meta fashion than some might appreciate, and Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker is the best he’s been (a low bar, but still) as he wallows, exhausted by the burden of his own legend. Despite the fan dues, though, what nuance remains gives us some of the most brazen Star Wars we’ve been privy to since Hayden Christensen murdered scores of children in the name of love. It’s no small accident that a franchise so steeped in nostalgia has come to the point of despising the past. 40 years in, the shadow of this saga looms large. Surviving eye-rolling cues and clunky dialogue are the least of The Last Jedi’s achievements. Rian Johnson’s main feat is being savvy enough to know that sometimes the best thing to do is cherishing the past before burning it to the ground."
"Dec 12, 2017",NEUTRAL," The Force, as the Jedi master has often explained if you would only listen, is not some magic power that enables you to lift rocks and wield a lightsaber. No, The Force is the energy between things, the tension between the light and the dark, the cycle of life and death. If the galaxy is ever to live in peace, what we are going to need is some balance. Flung back into that long-ago faraway galaxy for The Last Jedi, round two of the second Star Wars retread, we must once again rejoice in lightness and suffer in the dark. Nifty new animals, a maturing villain, a flagging heroine, muffled humour – as it seeks to uphold a giant cultural legacy, this unfolding trilogy struggles to maintain a balance that often seems just out of reach. Following the $4-billion (U.S.) sale of Lucasfilm to Disney, director J.J. Abrams revived the Stars Wars story in 2015 with The Force Awakens, a self-referential film that winked at the George Lucas formula it replicated. After the franchise-abasing Clone Wars prequel trilogy in the 2000s, it was an acceptable approach, but hardly an inspiring one. Now writer and director Rian Johnson picks up the action where Abrams left off – with Rey (Daisy Ridley) climbing a rocky island to find Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) – and the story settles in nicely. There's more room for interesting locales and exotic creatures; the Dark Side is more complex and convincing. And the plot, hopping nimbly from a rebel ship under fire to the First Order's command centre to Skywalker's island, chugs along satisfyingly for the first two acts. But gradually, Johnson's many additions become too much of a good thing and The Last Jedi grows crowded, busy and long. Promising new characters – a gracious rebel admiral (Laura Dern) in conflict with Oscar Isaac's energetic Poe Dameron; a lovable rogue played by Benicio Del Toro – are often shortchanged. Meanwhile, Johnson's dialogue is flat and sounds stilted in the mouths of his younger actors, while their comic delivery can be so offhand that it dismisses the jokes. The good guys, those characters required to be either idealistic or funny, are the ones who suffer most under the Johnson regime. With the excellent Adam Driver playing Kylo Ren (and the appearance of Andy Serkis as Supreme Leader Snoke rendered less silly this time), the forces of darkness are now dramatically ascendant. Will Skywalker come out his self-imposed exile to defeat them? This film deals tidily with the problematic legacy of two dimming stars – Hamill and the late Carrie Fisher. Hamill was never any Alec Guinness and, as he returns as the new generation's old greybeard, Johnson has cleverly enfolded that truth into the story of Skywalker's retirement: In his encounter with Kylo Ren, Hamill is a lesser actor playing a lesser man. He emerges with pride intact and further ahead than Fisher, who had completed the movie shortly before her death in 2016. She presents a strong physical presence as Leia but delivers her lines ponderously in a time-coarsened voice. Still, the older generation gets off fairly easy. Ridley, full of charming spunk playing a skeptical rebel recruit in The Force Awakens, is the biggest disappointment here. She is less engaging now that she is committed to the fight and plays most of the later action on a single note of earnest desperation; Johnson's script leaves her little else. She has also been separated from her supposed love interest, John Boyega's Finn. Instead, he teams up with a resourceful techie named Rose (Kelly Marie Tran). These two rejoice in the best setting – a glittering city where an arms-dealing elite races giant goats and gathers in a casino every bit as delightful as the Mos Eisley Cantina – but neither actor is deft enough to maintain a flagging plot about breaking into the First Order command. Those arms dealers, by the way, are selling to both sides in the rebellion. Star Wars, to its credit, has become increasingly convinced its world is not black and white and that evil can be explained. At the core of all the tangled back stories in this episode, there is a strong villain and – shades of Voldemort – he has the ability to penetrate the heroine's consciousness. The tantalizing possibility of some sexual chemistry in this Manichean battle poses the next question: Can Kylo Ren extract himself from the Dark Side to embrace Rey? Balance may yet be achieved."
"Dec 12, 2017",NEGATIVE,So many elements in Episode VIII are recycled that it could have been called Rerun of the Jedi.
"Dec 12, 2017",NEGATIVE," La suntuosa puesta en escena de ese presunto o cierto acontecimiento mundial que supone acceder antes de su estreno a un pase de prensa de Los últimos Jedi, la ¿octava, novena, centésima? entrega de aquello que comenzó con una música exaltante y sublime y un rótulo que anunciaba con legendaria fascinación: “Hace mucho tiempo, en una galaxia muy muy lejana”, es el prolegómeno para ser testigo de lo que esperan millones de espectadores de cualquier cultura y en cualquier lugar. Y ya no se trata de ver una película, esa cosita inicialmente gozosa que desde hace más de cuarenta años es algo cotidiano en mi trabajo. De entrada, en una fila asfixiante, me requisan mi anacrónico, pobrecito, tan viejo, tan solo teléfono, Nokia que aún me sirve para hablar con cada vez menos personas. Después cachean mimosamente mi ajada anatomía para prevenir que algún artefacto diabólico que pueda afectar al hipercalculado taquillaje de su divina criatura. Y luego una amable, natural, muy profesional jefa de prensa nos avisa de que alguien estará vigilándonos en la sala durante la proyección para que las tentaciones de los corsarios audiovisuales no triunfen. Mis castigadas vejiga y riñones me reclaman visitar la perfumada toilette a mitad de proyección (es imperdonablemente larga, como 150 minutos) y cuando regreso a la sala vuelven a chequear mi cuerpo, por si había algún espía en el lavabo. Y cuando finaliza esta lúdica e inolvidable gesta del actual cine de aventuras (aseguran muchos sin huellas de sonrojo) vuelvo a hacer interminable cola para que me devuelvan mi móvil y también me sugieren que deje en un papel mi opinión sobre lo que he visto. Me olvidaba, también nos han pedido antes que solo podremos escribir o hablar lo que hemos visto a partir de las seis de la tarde y un minuto de la tarde del martes, y nos piden educadamente que no contemos en ningún momento su argumento ni caigamos en el pecado del spoiler. Y recuerdo el nada original título de una canción de mi amado Leo Ferré: Les temps sont difficiles. Siempre lo fueron, Ferré. Pero los dinosaurios cada vez lo tienen más jodido. Y vamos al asunto. O no. Sigamos con las digresiones gratuitas. Se supone que lo que he visto, ese guion sin pies ni cabeza, solo referencias en las que me siento perdido, dirigida rutinariamente, es una precuela, secuela, remake, lo que demonios se inventen, de aquel cine y negocio fastuoso (descubrieron que lo del espectáculo solo era el soporte para un merchandising genial) que se inició con la memorable La guerra de las galaxias y continuó con la inquietante y sombría El imperio contraataca (en ellas apareció Yoda, un personaje que me fascinó, como Darth Vader y Obi-Wan Kenobi, y había alguno menos perturbador pero que me caía muy bien como el vitalista, audaz e irremplazable Han Solo) pero esto ha degenerado en un serial tan calculado y fofo que me aburre a morir, sin inspiración ni alma, servil con una fórmula que resulta infalible en el mercado, un cine que sabe que la paciencia de sus espectadores solo admite multitud de planos con duración mínima, embelesados con esa música que atruena en todos ellos, falsamente épico, inútilmente lírico, a la búsqueda de nuevos personajes que suenan a caricatura, cine con estrategia de acción continua, sin respiro, que en medio de esa apoteosis de batallas, duelos, ruidos y efectos especiales consigue la paradoja de que a ratos me quede frito. Y son varias generaciones las que siguen este show galáctico con el amor y la fidelidad de los creyentes. Benditos sean. Cómo les envidio. Yo tiemblo cada vez que tengo que padecer la nueva entrega de una saga que me resulta insoportable. Y durará hasta el infinito y más allá."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," For more than 40 years, the Star Wars movies have existed in a galaxy with a binary philosophy: There's good, and there's bad. There's the light side and the dark side. The Jedi and the Sith. The Rebel Alliance and the Empire. The Resistance and The First Order. Heroes and villains are tempted one way or the other, but rarely does the human condition get more complicated than these two poles. The truth is, however, that good and evil exists on a spectrum, and The Last Jedi explores these nuances of morality and psychology in a much more complex fashion than any Star Wars that's come before it.  The Last Jedi picks up immediately after the events of The Force Awakens, J.J. Abrams's revival of the Star Wars franchise, which many critiqued as being narratively too close to the original (with yet another Death Star and everything). And going into Rian Johnson's continuation of the saga, many were concerned that The Last Jedi would be very similar to The Empire Strikes Back. But I can happily say that, with a few minor details aside, this is not a remake of Episode V. Not at all. Instead, the events with The Resistance take on more of a ticking-clock space opera more similar to the 2004 Battlestar Galactica series. It delves into battle strategy and leadership rather than another generic, CGI space fight. What's most interesting, given the death of Han Solo in The Force Awakens, is this movie has more at stake. Anyone could die at any given time. Our heroes are not safe. Disney and Lucasfilm aren't afraid to get rid of anyone, which adds a welcome amount of tension to every scene.  Meanwhile, Rey is on Ahch-To, where she found Luke Skywalker and the ancient Jedi temple. But following his failure with Kylo Ren, Luke is unwilling to take on another pupil and has lost faith in the Jedi teachings. The Last Jedi is Mark Hamill's greatest performance as Luke Skywalker. That light in his eye, which we saw as the shaggy headed dreamer on Tatooine four decades ago, has almost flickered out. He's seen so much, and he's accomplished so much—but he has failed, too. He's struggling with his faith, his shortcomings as a teacher, and his decision to abandon his friends and their cause.  As we see how time has changed this cinematic icon, it's a reminder that our most beloved stories are never over. Happy endings are only the beginning of another chapter, and as Luke and Leia and Han celebrated on Endor all those years ago, they began another phase of life with its own challenges. This might be a hard thing for people to come to terms with. That happy ending we've enjoyed for decades is no more, replaced with the inevitable and more realistic provocations of life. So here is Rey, lightsaber in hand, ready to bring the hero back to save the day. But it doesn't always work that way. As Luke struggles with the Jedi, Rey is trying to figure out who she is and her place in this fight. It's not necessarily good or bad; it's what she feels is right. While these are more demanding concepts than kids might be equipped to deal with, this is the Star Wars that adults deserve—one that deals with human emotions more complex than those found in the binary world of a storybook. Along with Hamill, Carrie Fisher—the princess to whom this film is dedicated—gives one of her finest performances. The continuation of this saga would have been impossible with any lesser actors ready to reprise their characters. Hamill, Fisher, and Harrison Ford had so embodied Luke, Leia, and Han, that these characters seemed to grow with them. And in The Last Jedi, Fisher is the same Leia—bold, hilarious, and sharp—but with an added confidence, calm, and wisdom that comes from years in battle and leadership. Fisher's tragic death last year will certainly put a knot in the final movie (in which her character is already slated to appear); I don't see how they can do it. But The Last Jedi marks a bittersweet final performance from the actress who made her mark as the this fiery, determined character four decades ago.  This film also proves Disney and Lucasfilm's confidence in director/writer Rian Johnson. Having written such a deep script, he pulls it off with incredible flair. The fight on the planet of red dust that you've seen in previews is both a beautiful and violent work of art. The scenes on Ahch-To represent the juxtaposition of feelings from beautiful island sunsets to raging tropical storms. There are certainly some points where a plot or two are stitched together with some lazy storytelling, when the Force is used as more of a crutch, or at least could have benefitted from more visual flair. But for the most part, Johnson pulls it off with a unique take on all of those key Star Wars staples, which he fills with humor and childlike imagination—creating so many moments when the audience erupted in cheers. The Last Jedi is a welcome growth in the most beloved sci-fi franchise. It's the movie that, in many ways, fans have deserved for years. This is finally a Star Wars film that's ready to meet fans half-way, to both entertain and challenge. But that doesn't mean the path will be an easy one."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," “The Last Jedi,” which picks up where “The Force Awakens” leaves off, is a deep and rollicking episode — right up there with the very first “Star Wars” in terms of its enjoyability factor. Rating: 3.5 stars out of 4. “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” is a tremendously satisfying picture. It’s got everything fans of the franchise could want in a “Star Wars” movie — perhaps a little too much of some things in some cases. Hair’s breadth escapes, for example. It has them in bunches, with characters jumping out of frying pans and into fires, and back out again. Over and over again. ‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi,’ with Daisy Ridley, Mark Hamill, Adam Driver, Carrie Fisher, Oscar Isaac, John Boyega, Kelly Marie Tran, Benicio Del Toro. Written and directed by Rian Johnson. 152 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi action and violence. Several theaters.  It blasts off to a high-powered start with a spectacular space battle between ships of the Rebellion and the evil First Order and then gets down to business by returning to the remote island hideout where the redoubtable Rey (Daisy Ridley) comes face to face with Mark Hamill’s long-missing Luke Skywalker. Picking up right where “The Force Awakens” leaves off, “Last Jedi” gives us a Luke who is grizzled, haunted and cowled like a medieval monk. Long gone is the optimistic, swashbuckling kid of the original trilogy. All these years later he’s taken refuge in the “most unfindable place in the galaxy” to brood over a long-ago trauma relating to his status as a legendary Jedi master. His character, like that of all other major figures in the picture, has been deepened and made more complex by writer-director Rian Johnson, who builds on the groundwork laid down in “The Force Awakens.” Ridley’s Rey is more nuanced, cautiously exploring her growing connection to the Force. John Boyega as a one-time-Storm-Trooper-turned-rebel is given more prominence in the plotting. And the late Carrie Fisher, in her final performance, brings great gravity to her portrayal of Leia. The movie is dedicated to her. However, it’s Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), introduced in “The Force Awakens,” who, more than Luke or Rey, is the central figure in “Jedi.” Grandson of Darth Vader, murderer of his father Han Solo, he’s the focus of the core question of: Is he so far gone over to the dark side of the Force that he’s irredeemable? Rey, who has a Force-fostered telepathic connection with him, thinks there may still be some good buried somewhere deep inside him. The vicious, wizened supreme ruler Snoke (Andy Serkis) wonders about the depth of his commitment to evil as well. He scorns Kylo for having been bested in a lightsaber duel with Rey, a girl who never held such a weapon before. “You’re no Vader,” he rasps “Just a child in a mask.” Stung, Kylo removes the mask. But in so doing, his true nature paradoxically remains even more hidden. The nature of his relationship to the dark side affects all the other major characters in profound ways. Johnson, making the leap from small-bore pictures like “Looper” and “The Brothers Bloom” to the biggest show in the universe, directs with great confidence, adroitly balancing character development with spectacle."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," There are countless moments in “Star Wars: Episode VIII — The Last Jedi” where writer-director Rian Johnson could have shown reverence for the past, whether it’s 2015’s “Episode VII — The Force Awakens,” which helped restart the idling sci-fi franchise, or the previous four decades of Star Wars lore. “The Last Jedi” may pick up where J.J. Abrams’ “The Force Awakens” left off, but it delivers on Johnson’s oft-stated promise to explode expectations. Between Star Wars’ slavish, hyper-critical fan base and the franchise’s corporate overlords at Disney, that’s no easy task. And yet “The Last Jedi” hums with Johnson’s rascal energy, making “The Force Awakens” look simplistic and apple-cheeked in the same way 1980’s “Episode V — The Empire Strikes Back” did with George Lucas’ 1977 original. Those comparisons — inevitable, given that “The Last Jedi” is the middle of this current trilogy — are warranted in some ways. “The Last Jedi” is a long, complex film with more gray areas to explore than its predecessor. Its fast-moving plot often hinges on technical details, and characters rarely pause or repeat themselves."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"  There are a handful of truly spectacular moments in The Last Jedi—some as visually sumptuous and others as emotionally poignant and raw as anything in the intergalactic ring cycle so far: The sight of Rebel X-wing fighters emerging from light speed and skidding to a halt; a kamikaze crash rendered in giddy, gasp-inducing super slo-motion; a vertiginous, ground-scraping dogfight on a salt-mining planet that kicks up plumes of velvet-cake red dust. These, along with a few touching reunions and farewells from beloved characters that some of us have known like family for 40 years, will go down as instant classics that will be catnip for fans young and old. That said, I’d stop short of calling director Rian Johnson’s undeniably impressive initiation into the Star Wars fold the masterpiece that some desperately want it to be. The film simply drags too much in the middle. Somewhere in the film’s 152-minute running time is an amazing 90-minute movie.
  Even though it’s only been two short years since The Force Awakens, Lucas’ franchise is so iconic, so mythically ingrained in the deepest nostalgia pleasure centers of our brains that you have to be a churl not to feel goosebumps raise on your arms when the words “A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away” first appear on screen and John Williams’ triumphant clarion-call to adventure strikes up. The opening crawl that follows informs us that the evil First Order is ascendant. Supreme Leader Snoke and his Dark Side apprentice Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and bureaucratic bully boy General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) have culled the resistance down to a few hundred ragtag insurgents. Things are looking bleak for the rebels. But under the wise and steady hand of General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), they fight on. Martyrs to the cause, underdog champions of capital-G Good. Leia’s last hope of rallying the downtrodden is to convince the reluctant Jedi Master Luke (now more an idea of revolution than a one-man savior) to return from hiding.
  In a way, we’ve been here before. The rebels are against the ropes just as they were at the end of The Empire Strikes Back. Thankfully, this time, they have their three newly-minted Next Generation heroes—Oscar Isaac’s hotshot and hotheaded fighter pilot Poe Dameron, John Boyega’s conscience-stricken stormtrooper-turned-resistance folk hero Finn, and Ridley’s Rey, a gung-ho young heroine whose innate powers she’s just beginning to understand. The chemistry and interplay between these three new faces was so electric and promising the last time we saw them that it’s a bit of a shame that the trio is separated for most of the new film. They’re all cast off in separate parts of the same grand mission. While Isaac’s Poe grows impatient about the play-it-safe approach charted by Leia and her purple-haired second in command (the always welcome Laura Dern), Boyega’s Finn teams up with a Resistance mechanic named Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) to track down a a codebreaking scoundrel (Benicio Del Toro) to sabotage the First Order’s new ability to follow the rebel ships in and out of light speed, preventing their safe evacuation to a new hideout where they can reteam and rebuild. Meanwhile, Rey is just where we left her—on the remote Jedi temple island of Ahch-To, hounding Luke not only return to action, but also to tutor her in the ways of the Force the way Yoda once taught him on Degobah. This last strand of the three has the most pay off by far. Not just because the push-pull, master-apprentice dynamic between Ridley and Hamill is so crackling it nearly sets off sparks, but because we know that this is the crux of the story. That this is where the torch (or lightsaber) will be passed.
  Johnson toggles back and forth between these three narrative yarns well enough as the stakes grow more desperate. But after the first third of the film, when the table is set, the second act gets a little bloated and unwieldy. There’s a lengthy diversion to the casino planet of Canto Bight (a ritzy Monaco for the galaxy’s one percent that’s like Mos Eisley with tuxedos and baccarat) that feels pointless and tacked on just for the sake of giving us a cool new corner of the galaxy to feast our eyes on. Meanwhile Driver’s Kylo Ren and Ridley’s Rey have formed a telepathic connection that plays out like a slightly cheesy sci-fi version of Ghost. Each in their own way is trying to woo the other to their side. Is it romantic? A manipulative power play? Maybe both? Either way, Isaac and Boyega seem to be sidelined or stuck in idle for long stretches. Unfortunately for the future of the franchise, it’s the old faces that provide the most poignant moments. We know that The Last Jedi will be Fisher’s final film, and we savor every moment with her like we’re saying goodbye to a loved one. And Hamill, who once created one of cinema’s most iconic characters but would never be considered by anyone to be a great actor, gives the single best acting performance of his career. When he first enters the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon and first reunites with his old friend Artoo, you might even get choked up.
  Despite the flabby mid-section of the film and its menagerie of new alien creatures that are a mixed bag (Yay, Porgs with their squat guinea pig bodies and sad Anime saucer eyes; boo to the others that look like exiles from The Neverending Story), Johnson really delivers with the third and final act. The climactic last 45 minutes of the film is as thrilling and spectacular as anything Star Wars has ever given us. There are cool, mythic hand-to-hand battles, breathtaking aerial sequences, and one mano a mano showdown that’s as epic as anything Sergio Leone ever dreamed up. And again, the film ends on a note that feels…just…right.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," “Let the past die. Kill it if you have to,” he advises unwilling protégé Rey in The Last Jedi. “That’s the only way to become what you’re meant to be.” Isolation does weird things to the mind, even a mighty Jedi mind. Luke (Mark Hamill; intensely soulful) has lived in hermetic seclusion for yonks on a remote island with only some penguiny creatures, alien nuns and his own gloomy thoughts for company. So you’ll excuse the lurch into banal wishful thinking. If Star Wars teaches anything, it is that the past cannot die, while becoming what you are meant to be is a matter not of will but of destiny. You can run to the furthest outreach of the universe, but you cannot hide from fate.  She found Luke, and to this reluctant warrior, and more reluctant legend, she handed his light sabre. Whether he will choose to return to the battle or sulk in his cave like an intergalactic Achilles is one of three internalised conflicts at the film’s heart. Rey, the abandoned child of scavengers with the mystical gifts, struggles to face her destiny. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), son of Leia and Han Solo, and Luke’s nephew, is tormented by his journey to the Dark Side. This trio and their interactions are the only elements that develop the story. All else is padding, though after a languid start, and despite the saggy middle, it is generally entertaining padding.  Director Rian Johnson pitches us into the midst of aerial battle scenes to lend vibrant intimacy to the wearily familiar. A scene in a casino in which rolling droid BB-8 is mistaken for a slot machine is one of several excellent gags, visual and verbal, that leaven the introspection. But Johnson wastes Finn (the former Storm Trooper played by John Boyega who was a revelation in The Force Awakens) by relegating him to an inflated cameo, and denies Fisher a glorious swansong by leaving Leia out of action for too long. The versatile Domhnall Gleeson finds nuggets of comedy in General Hux, Ren’s rival, and Andy Serkis nails the performance capture once again as Snoke, the First Order’s supreme leader who means to turn Ren into the new Vader.  Why a creature of such immense power hasn’t done something about his teeth, which make Albert Steptoe look like a Colgate model, is a minor mystery. The major ones concern the trinity of the tormented, beautifully played by Ridley, Hamill and particularly Driver, who finds the light and dark within what might have been a dull caricature of wickedness.  Who were Rey’s parents, and how can she and Kylo Ren maintain crackling sexual tension by telepathy alone? If Luke honestly hates the idea of being the new Obi Wan, why doesn’t he ditch the trademark Kenobi cloak? Is he truly the last Jedi? And what exactly, once again, is the Force? Good luck with finding any answers in two and a half hours of unevenly paced, sporadically exhilarating, rather Wagnerian space opera with a pair of thrilling twists and a powerful finish. If the injection of nuanced confliction was designed to reinvent the franchise, too many old bones are thrown to slavering fans (name one on spoiler grounds I may not) for that.  Besides, you cannot kill the past. What you can do is build on it to enable an intriguing future. At the very least, The Last Jedi does that."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," It’s hard to know where to start reviewing The Last Jedi, because so much happens in this movie that I have whiplash. But I’m happy about it. The Mary Sue’s spoiler-free review, ahead. Clocking in at two and a half hours, The Last Jedi is the longest Star Wars yet, a length that is both a blessing and a curse. You’re never bored, but there’s so much material covered here that The Last Jedi easily could have been two movies, and there’s so many final standoffs and climactic scenes by its close that it feels like at least four or five movies’ worth of conclusions. By the end, you will probably feel as exhausted and exhilarated as I do now, having been through so much; like me, you may cry openly during at least three parts of this film. The Last Jedi picks up where The Force Awakens left off without missing a beat—hardly any time has passed. Impetuous flyboy Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), who needs no introduction, are our windows into the struggling Resistance; ex-Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) was injured in TFA but soon rejoins the action, with the wonderful Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), a Resistance engineer, at his side. Tran’s Rose is every bit the breakout that she’s being touted as, and I can’t wait for a new generation to love her as she deserves. Over on the Dark Side of things, Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) has plans to swing the fight and the balance of the Force in his favor, assisted by the oft-sneering General Hux (Dohmnall Gleeson) and of course the former Ben Solo, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), whose loyalties are called into question. Meanwhile, amateur Force user Rey (Daisy Ridley) has found Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), and the film picks them right back up at the last minutes of TFA, with Rey beseechingly presenting Luke his lightsaber. New big-name additions to the cast include Laura Dern as an unconventional Resistance Admiral and Benicio Del Toro as … well, it’s best to let you wait and see. Let’s just say he definitely Benicio Del Toros it. If even just typing out all of those characters takes two paragraphs, imagine how many we’d need to describe what they all get up to. I’m keeping this as spoiler-free as possible, but if I were to meet you at a bar right now and attempt to explain the entire plot of this film, we’d be there for hours. Thankfully, it successfully hits the beats that we want and hope for from a Star Wars film, even if that means we get a whole lot of beats. There is intergenerational family drama, defined by deep love and deeper betrayals. There are Force-use training montages. There are adorable and sympathetic alien creatures that feature importantly into the plot (a lot of creatures). There are great friendships and also ever-shifting allegiances. There are sparks of romance. There are twenty movies’ worth of twists and last-minute interventions that turn the tide. And there is a fantastic amount of incredible space jewelry, likely thanks to the late Carrie Fisher, to whom the film is dedicated. Let’s take a moment to talk about Fisher. She is luminous here. Every time she’s on screen, it’s impossible to look away, and she is as tough, loving, and wily as we would ever want our Leia to be. We drink her scenes in, uncertain if we’ll see her in Star Wars again. Her part is quite central, and it’s impossible to imagine this universe without her. She is responsible for at least 3/4 of the tears trickling down my face during this movie. She, and Leia, are the shining light in The Last Jedi that all characters who dream of defeating the Dark Side look to for guidance. In fact, it is women who are the leaders at the heart of the Resistance. I have never seen more women occupy important roles in a Star Wars movie, and the screen is also often full of wonderfully diverse faces serving both sides of the Force. Woefully underused, however, is Gwendoline Christie’s shiny, nefarious Captain Phasma, for no reason that I can possibly discern. Otherwise, this is rather a tour de force for the ladies, with Leia, Rey, Rose, Dern’s Admiral Holdo, and even a cameo from Lupita Nyong’o’s Maz Kanata all vital to the proceedings. Fisher’s daughter Billie Lourd is also back on board as a Resistance Lieutenant who helps out Poe, and no, I’m not crying anymore, you are. Any real problems in The Last Jedi stem from the fact that there’s just so much going on that it’s hard to stay invested in every subplot. There are also decisions and plans made at breakneck speed that seem crucial at the time and end up not seeming to matter at all; examining the film’s logic under a microscope would not return beneficial results. But we’re not here for logic. We’re here for highly emotional epic drama in space, and herein the film delivers. Surprisingly, the most compelling relationship to emerge is not between Luke and Rey, or Finn and Rose (though I adore them), or Poe and Leia: it is Rey and Kylo Ren’s interactions that rule this movie, and they are the axis upon which everything else turns. How you feel about those interactions could largely determine how you feel about The Last Jedi. The first half of the movie moves at a slower pace, with a lot of time given to Rey’s self-exploration and her attempts to engage Luke on his distant island (yes, this is the island of the porgs). Meanwhile, what feels too much like the “B plot” side adventure has Finn and Rose on a mission that takes them into another film entirely, a sort of intergalactic James Bond-meets-Free Willy. It’s hard not to feel that their entire subplot could be axed in order to make The Last Jedi stronger and tighter, which is unfortunate. Luckily, both Finn and Rose get to shine in the latter half, when things really pick up, and then move so fast that you’re left quite dizzy and mostly dazzled. Visually The Last Jedi is absolutely stunning, and it’s not hard to see why Disney and Lucasfilm are trusting director/writer Rian Johnson with the keys to the Star Wars kingdom going forward. The sets and settings are always evocative and impeccable, as is the costuming; the musical scores we’ve come to love swell at exactly the right moments; the special effects are seamless and convincing. The only thing that Johnson might need is a bit of reining in: he’s full of so many good ideas and such obvious love for this universe that sometimes he gets carried away, and he has filled this movie to the very brim. But I’ll take that kind of oversaturation any day over the bloodlessness that marked the prequels. No one can accuse The Last Jedi of not having heart. While I expected to be sad at the sight of Fisher, I did not expect to spend whole parts of the screening trying unsuccessfully not to cry. I am not a movie crier, but there you have it. Ultimately, despite all its bold colors, winning performances, and many moving parts, the movie belongs to Fisher, who is resplendent; Hamill, who plays an altered Luke, weathered by storms, with conviction; and Driver, whose flat delivery can shift into vulnerability or rage when you least expect it. In the end, it’s the oldest Star Wars lesson: you can’t keep those Skywalkers down."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Nostalgia is a wonderful thing, and the last two Star Wars films have explored and plundered their past with great success. Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi knows and loves its predecessors and it certainly isn’t above a heart-warming (or a heart-breaking) call-back every now and then, but it’s a bold step away from what’s come before and that ambition is thrilling to watch. The film’s darkness was expected. This is the middle chapter in the trilogy after all, but it’s much more than a glum springboard for the grand finale and it doesn’t just crib from The Empire Strikes Back. It’s about finding hope when all hope is lost, and the way it foregrounds the need for humanity in times of conflict resonates even more strongly than the “Rebel!” rallying cry of Rogue One. Which all makes The Last Jedi sound rather grand and self-important, but that’s not really the case. Rian Johnson’s script is very funny (almost jarringly so early on until you click with the tone), with one-liners and well-played character humour puncturing the portentous moments and allowing much-needed relief in an increasingly grim time for the rebellion. It also has a wealth of thrilling action sequences, real character development, beautiful production design, ace new creatures (yes, the Porgs are great), and somehow there’s a caper in the middle. That being said, the film starts in a fantastically gloomy place. The First Order has Leia’s dwindling rebel forces on the run and at the end of their rope. The dashing Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is learning the hard way that there’s a difference between being the best pilot in the galaxy and being a leader. Finn (John Boyega) heads off on a dangerous mission with plucky maintenance worker Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and discovers that there are grey areas in the galaxy and insidious corrupting forces beyond “The Dark Side”. And, of course, there’s Rey, who finds that convincing Luke Skywalker to return as the hero the rebellion needs is not going to be an easy task. Hamill’s not been shy about expressing his initial disagreement with Johnson’s treatment of Luke in the script, and it is hard to accept the cynical, abrasive recluse we’re given. But one of The Last Jedi’s most impressive feats is that every big swing, every moment that makes the fan in you a little uneasy as Johnson steers away from the past (which Kylo is so keen to kill), is earned. The film is overlong at two and a half hours, and you may well catch yourself thinking “this could probably have been cut.” But it’s all there for a reason and for the most part it’s not to simply prop up big flashy twists and reveals (although, goddamn, it’s not a spoiler to say there are plenty of those). It’s all about character. Each of our leads, old and new, is forced to take a step back and look beyond their most visceral instincts. That even includes Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who’s pushing to prove to the sneering Snoke (Andy Serkis) that he’s stronger than ever. Driver is superb, his performance getting more nuanced as we dig deeper into Kylo’s past, and he’s matched at every step by Ridley, who goes on a similarly complex emotional journey and has only got better in the role. In fact, everyone’s great. Hamill is fearsome, unpredictable and totally compelling, Isaac adds a short fuse to Poe’s cockiness, Serkis is magnificently odious, Domhnall Gleeson looks much more comfortable as Hux, and franchise newcomers Laura Dern (steely Vice Admiral Holdo, who doesn’t hesitate to put Poe in his place) and Tran (who is wonderful as Rose) quickly make their mark. Everyone matters, everyone gets their moment, and everyone is full of surprises. This helps to make The Last Jedi a surprisingly emotional experience, although we knew in advance that we’d be struggling to hold back tears every time Carrie Fisher was on screen. She has a lot more to do here than in the previous chapter and, for fear of spoilers, we’ll just say that she is wonderful. There are moments that don’t quite land and sequences that go on longer than they need to, but there’s so much to admire here that quibbles are quickly forgotten. The emotional pay-offs are huge, the visuals are stunning, the performances are brilliant and, even as it eagerly explores the darkness, The Last Jedi never loses sight of its heart. We can’t wait to see where the story goes from here."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Alex Garland’s film, starring Kirsten Dunst as a photojournalist, added $11.12 million this weekend. It has, so far, grossed $45 million. A24’s most expensive movie to date additionally made $5 million overseas. On Saturday, actors Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Joshua Leonard released a joint statement, directed at Lionsgate, asking for retroactive and future residual payments for their roles in the original film. Last year, French journalist Bernard Montiel had revealed that Depp and Maïwenn were not getting along during the shoot of ‘Jeanne’ and that there was tension for months between director and actor. In an interview with OMRI, ‘Passion’ screenwriter Randall Wallace is confirming the screenplay for the sequel is finished, that Jim Caviezel is, obviously, going to star as Jesus, and that production could begin very soon. Last year, it was announced that Adam Wingard and his longtime collaborator, writer Simon Barrett, were teaming up teaming up for a sequel to 1997’s “Face/Off.” Because Hollywood pretends Thursday previews are just part of Friday openings, boosting the opening day number with an extra night of receipts, “Abigail” was #1 on “Friday,” beating out “Civil War” by only a few thousand dollars. Remember Chris Columbus? He was the director critics loved to hate in the ‘90s and early aughts. He directed many successful movies, “Home Alone,” “Home Alone 2,” “Mrs. Doubtfire,” “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.” UPDATE: I had the roles mixed up. Ferrell is OUT as Madden, he’s being replaced by Jackman. Weird casting. Also, Tom Hanks is in talks to play Oakland Raiders football coach Al Davis. George Miller’s “Furiosa” is set to premiere at Cannes next month. The highly anticipated ‘Mad Max’ prequel is on the cover of this month’s Empire Magazine, and there are some very interesting nuggets inside this issue. Of M Night Shyamalan’s 16 feature films, only a single one was over 2 hours (“Glass”). So, consider me surprised by Cryptic HD’s assertion that Shyamalan’s “Trap” clocks in at a whopping 2 hours and 30 minutes. If there ever was a video which would convince me that James Mangold’s “A Complete Unknown” will have some issues then it’s certainly this one. Nancy Sinatra reposted a tweet on X which seems to disapprove of casting Leonardo DiCaprio as her father Frank Sinatra & Jennifer Lawrence as his wife Ava Gardner in Maritn Scorsese’s biopic. Alex Garland’s next film, “Warfare”, which he’s co-directing with Ray Mendoza, might be even an even more expensive endeavor for A24. My best guess is its budget might hit the $60-70 million range. Remember, over the weekend, when we discussed J.J. Abrams’ absence from directing? Was he in director’s jail for his dubious attempt at reviving Star Wars? Watching “Challengers,” I kept being reminded of David Fincher’s “The Social Network,” which also had shifting timelines, a brilliantly pulsating electronic score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, and stylishly vibrant direction. The latest Shyamalan is called “Trap” and is set in and around a concert. The Hitchcock influence is again very much present. A trailer has just been released for the film, which is set to hit theaters on August 9."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," NEW YORK — If I had the opportunity to call writer/director Rian Johnson I’d have just one thing to say – “great shot, kid, that was one in a million!” But no, that would actually be all wrong. You see, that would be me making a “Star Wars” reference, a little joke that is insider-y, but not too insider-y — one that’s the tone of so many geek franchise sequels and prequels and reboots. But that is precisely not what Johnson’s new film “The Last Jedi” (or “Episode VIII” if you like Roman numerals) is all about. Sure, there are a few winks to hardcore fans (did Luke Skywalker just say “laser sword”?) and yes, you definitely need to be caught up on the series for this ridiculous space opera to make any sense. But the main reason to stand up and cheer “The Last Jedi” is its breakaway from the constraints of the previous two post-George Lucas films. It is not a retread reliant on coincidences, nor is it merely connective tissue between known stories, neither does it necessarily rhyme with pre-existing canon in any cutesy way. It is its own thing. Every character from “The Force Awakens” is back (except, of course, for the ones who died) and they’ve all got something action-packed and dangerous to do. Well, all except Rey, who has been dispatched to the ancient Jedi temples on Ahch-To to retrieve Luke Skywalker. He’s been moping around for decades ever since his nephew Kylo Ren went nuts with the Dark Side. If Rey can convince Luke to return to the Rebel Alliance, maybe they can stop The First Order from being an exact duplicate of the Empire from the original trilogy. Luke isn’t interested, so there’s some typical back and forth about Destiny and whatnot that, for the hundreds of times I’ve watched these movies, inevitably forces me to zone-out a little. Even Yoda (as a Force Ghost) shows up, and while on the one hand he’s an adorable, wrinkly Rabbi, he can also be something of a drip. But things do work on an emotional level. If logic won’t convince Luke, maybe R2-D2 replaying the old hologram of Princess Leia saying “you’re my only hope” will. Princess Leia is General Leia now, and Carrie Fisher’s screen presence has considerable added resonance now that she has passed away. Fisher’s daughter Billie Lourd gets a good degree of screen time as Kaydel Ko Connix (okay, I had to look that up), a random good gal who repeats orders a lot on the bridge of the main Resistance ship. Even if Fisher hadn’t died, her character exudes melancholy. It’s dark times for the Rebels, with the First Order laying waste to their fleet. All of our heroes (Finn, Poe, BB-8, newcomer Rose, Chewbacca) are out zipping around on special assignments that, if it all works out, could help everyone live to fight another day. But at center is Rey’s rematch against Kylo Ren. Their first encounters, which take the form of Force-enhanced Skype calls, lead to an audience with Supreme Leader Snoke, one of the most shocking, unpredictable and drop-dead awesome scenes in all of “Star Wars.” (No joke, this ranks as one of the top five, maybe top two Star Wars scenes of all time.) From a design point of view, this newest film is the slickest and most gorgeous in the entire series. Maybe the 1977 film can still fight for that title based on it originality, but “The Last Jedi” is one of those “every frame a painting” movies in its use of color, camera placement and extremely detailed sets. It also wins points for its creatures, not limited to the already beloved Porgs. These dopey half-puffins, half-corgis don’t really add much to the story, but are hilarious in ways that previous would-be comic relief critters often aren’t. Humor plays a big factor in the film, and not just Oscar Isaac being a scamp or Domhnall Gleason exaggerating his Irish accent and scowling to the point of absurdity. On more than one occasion the vibe that inspired Indiana Jones to shrug and shoot the Cairo Swordsman in “Raiders of the Lost Ark” finds its way to this film, bringing a layer of realness that is rarely seen in the franchise. (Some purists will balk but trust me, they are no fun.) Walt Disney and Lucasfilm have a money machine on their hands, and these movies will never stop coming. There will never be star peace. But as “Rogue One” made evident, not all “Star Wars” movies are equal. I remain suspicious of the in-between films, especially the next one that is a Han Solo prequel. But Rian Johnson is already on board to do his own trilogy once J.J. Abrams brings this one home. The galaxy is in very secure hands.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," J.J. Abrams’ franchise resuscitator The Force Awakens was a crucial pivot back to Star Wars fundamentals; realigning priorities to character over special effects after the prequel trilogy, while introducing a new cast of spunky hopefuls to dance between old memories of Princess Leia, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. For all its successes, The Force Awakens felt like someone reopening the toy box to reminisce the good old days. A necessary, if slightly hollow, hype recharge which captured the spirit of Star Wars without doing much particularly fresh or interesting with the play-set we’re already familiar with.  Luckily, director Rian Johnson’s confident, thrilling outing digs deep into the highlights of its predecessor, while fleshing out the universe with fresh ideas which give this trip to a galaxy far, far away an identity all of its own. Picking up directly after events in The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi sees The First Order pushing the remaining members of The Resistance, led by Leia, to the far corners of the galaxy.  As the rebels wrestle with the odds stacked against them, Rey is attempting to learn the ways of the force from a recluse Luke Skywalker – who isn’t quite living up to his heroic Jedi legend. The script possesses a nodding awareness which occasionally punctures the pomposity, with Domnhall Gleeson’s General Hux particularly undergoing a welcome rebrand which turns his lust for power into a reoccurring punchline. It’s a bold move which could have uncomfortably swayed into Marvel’s lightness of touch, yet oddly, it makes Star Wars feel more alive than it’s ever been.  New creatures, like the scene-stealing Porgs, litter the world as hilarious visual gags, while new planets brim with personality and memorable species which easily stand alongside favourites like the Ewoks and Tauntauns. He doesn’t just understand Star Wars, he digs under its nails and (quite literally) rips it anew. We’re tucked inside places we’ve never seen before, whether zooming down a ship’s bomb drop chute or highlighting exactly how those First Order jumpsuits are so immaculate.  The relationship between Rey and Kylo Ren takes centre stage and is given interesting, surprising new twists throughout, and although all of the ‘new’ cast give admirable performances, Adam Driver is the standout – turning Kylo Ren into the complex, layered villain merely teased at within The Force Awakens. Instead of being a nostalgic check-in, his character is given renewed purpose which feels like natural progression of the original saga. In many ways, The Last Jedi is Hamill’s moment to shine, being given some killer scenes which is rewarding catnip for longtime Star Wars fans.  We haven’t even mentioned the excellent additions of Laura Dern, newcomer Kelly Marie Tran as starry-eyed Rose Tico, or the superior revamped interpretation of Supreme Leader Snoke; which is a testament to The Last Jedi’s dense and thorough improvements scattered throughout. As the final third delivers an instant classic action sequence with a glorious clash of colour and metal, it’s hard not to feel like Star Wars has truly returned.  Packed with fresh ideas, bold decisions and iconic moments, Rian Johnson has taken The Force Awakens reset button and expanded it in every way – delivering the greatest Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back."

Despite J.J. Abrams successfully resuscitating the
Star Wars franchise with 2015’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens, many fans were still left yearning for something new. It was comforting to see old familiar faces from a galaxy far, far away, but casual fans were unlikely to tolerate another greatest hits collection from a franchise already plagued by compositional overlap (to put it kindly).
  Thankfully, the latest entry in the series, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, has a refreshingly new story to tell. Writer-director Rian Johnson clearly intends to subvert our expectations at every turn. Yes, it takes entirely too long to get started and then it doesn’t know when to end, but Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a rousing space adventure that spares the platitudes in favor of big emotional payoffs. 
When last we saw Rey (Daisy Ridley), she was presenting a visibly haggard Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) with his iconic lightsaber as they posed for a dramatic aerial camera shot. Luke
very reluctantly takes the powerful young girl under his crusty wing, but not for the reasons you might imagine. It’s the first of many surprises concocted by Johnson (Brick (2005), Looper (2012), and the mighty “Ozymandias” from Breaking Bad), who taunts our knowledge and familiarity with the franchise in delightfully twisted ways.
 
While it’s overly simplistic to call this the darkest chapter in the series (that honor still falls to the masterful
The Empire Strikes Back), it’s certainly fair to say Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the most cynical. Luke’s selfish reasons for tutoring Rey, along with multiple Rashomon-like flashbacks revealing the betrayal of his former apprentice, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), reflect a modern-day cynicism that fans of the original Star Wars trilogy might find jarring (but not Jar Jarring, fortunately).
 
This is a world where Good and Evil fight one another not out of ideological necessity, but as a byproduct of inescapable human frailty and those who profit by enabling it. Both forces are helplessly trapped in a “machine” that will play out the same cycle over and over again. The only thing that truly matters — that which sustains us through the pointless monotony — is the emotional connection that binds us together. It’s ironic that by injecting a shot of cynicism into this glorified soap opera, Johnson provides the most satisfying explanation yet for the significance of The Force.
 
Aside from Rey’s training and her inevitable dalliance with the Dark Side, Johnson must set up two other story threads that are, sadly, less interesting on their own. General “Princess” Leia (Carrie Fisher in her last role) scrambles her fighters, including the “trigger-happy flyboy,” Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), to run interference for the Resistance’s crippled spaceship. The First Order (the bad guys in this new trilogy) can track the Resistance during light speed jumps, allowing Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) to simply follow the ship until it runs out of fuel. Apparently, none of their favorite television shows are on, so they’ve got nothing better to do with their time. In the third thread, Finn (John Boyega) and newcomer Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) must sneak aboard the First Order ship and disable the light speed tracking device. This quest takes them to a planet populated by wealthy weapons dealers and a stuttering Benicio Del Toro, who can supposedly break any code. It’s always nice to see Del Toro, but his efforts to fill the ‘lovable rogue’ gap left by the death of Han Solo are largely unsuccessful. 
These latter two threads struggle mightily to take flight, inflicting a considerable drag on the engrossing storyline that follows Luke, Rey, and Kylo Ren along their bizarre love/hate triangle. It’s only at the midpoint of the film, when these three threads intersect, that things really click. From that point forward,
Star Wars: The Last Jedi is almost non-stop action; epic space battles interspersed with ruthlessly efficient character moments that swing the action into new and surprising directions.
 
Johnson flashes an impressive array of visual techniques. There are a startling number of sets and individual shots that should pry their way into the
Star Wars iconography. From Supreme Leader Snoke’s chamber, which looks like a discotheque designed by Devil worshiping Nazis, to a final lightsaber battle in front of a crumbling fortress, there’s a feast of images that will have sci-fi fans drooling.
 
All of this spectacle might feel empty were it not for the unrelenting tension and countless dramatic twists. This, perhaps, explains Johnson’s difficulty in sculpting an elegant finalé. What feels like a satisfying ending is merely the prelude to something bigger and noisier. Just when it appears Johnson might have lost control, he pulls back to reveal an even
more satisfying conclusion. It’s a precarious balance that works, primarily, because we have such affection for these characters.
 
Given the insistence upon juggling three storylines (a
Star Wars tradition that desperately needs to be broken), there’s not much room for the actors to breathe. Isaac delivers most of the humor, though there’s less to be found here than Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Perhaps the character who continues to grow and surprise the most is Kylo Ren, which gives Adam Driver the most opportunity to shine. Carrie Fisher is much more prominent as Leia, however, giving fans one last chance to enjoy this beloved character.
 
For the first time in several decades, the
Star Wars saga is moving in new and exciting directions. If Star Wars: The Last Jedi isn’t a complete deconstruction of the original trilogy, it’s at least an acknowledgement that these archetypical characters must evolve in order to survive. Discretion and disillusionment are now active components in a universe built upon naiveté and reckless heroes. Perhaps, for some viewers, this will tarnish the escapist nature of Lucas’s original vision, but it’s a necessary turn if Star Wars wishes to remain relevant.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"It's not a perfect movie by any means; some of the comedy is a little too silly and one or two of the plot threads feel a bit less important than the others, but these quibbles were minor when compared to the parts that work. Those REALLY work."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," The word “hope” is bandied around quite a bit in Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi. During a perilous moment, one character compares it to seeing the sun. Leia, who uttered it at the very end of last year’s Rogue One, says with a glint in her eye. For fans of the storied saga, the word is more of a rallying cry. We hope The Last Jedi will live up to the hype. We hope it will be a worthy final project for the late, great Carrie Fisher. We hope Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker will be Luke Skywalker. Here’s the reality: The Last Jedi is . . . an ultra-rousing and satisfying success. It’s a Star Wars movie that appeals to the action-oriented, easily awed child as well as the child within that still roots for good to triumph over the dark side. No spoiler to reveal that kindhearted characters do the right thing. Sinister characters do the wrong thing. But Episode VIII stands out as a fascinating entry because it explores what happens when a person falls somewhere in the middle. (There’s a reason why lightsabers don’t come in shades of grey). Even as a positive energy source, the Force still has its limits. Or does it? Luke Skywalker knows the answer. And if nothing else, rejoice because we’re still witnessing Luke’s journey. While Episode VII: The Force Awakens checked all the boxes, it felt like a cheap mind trick that the self-exiled former Jedi master did not speak a single line of dialogue — he only looked warily as Rey (Daisy Ridley) handed over his light saber in an almost literal cliffhanger. Here, he not only talks, he has plenty to say. This is a heavy, beaten-down Skywalker, a man still reeling because his own nephew, Ben Solo, turned on him and morphed into powerful Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Despite Rey’s pleading, he has zero interest in schooling her and helping the Rebellion. If you squint hard enough, though, you can still see remnants of the noble warrior. And he sees something special in this mysterious, driven onetime junkyard scavenger in search of her parents. Willing to take a chance on her is he. That is Side A. In Side B — side BB-8? — Leia’s Rebellion troops battle General Snoke (Andy Serkis), Kylo Ren, General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) and the rest of the First Order. And things aren’t going well. In an attempt to thwart the next attack, former Stormtrooper (John Boyega) teams up with a mechanic (plucky newcomer Kelly Marie Tran) to travel to a new planet and track down a shifty tech whiz (Benicio De Toro, who gets “and” billing in the closing credits). Their destination is an intergalactic version of Monte Carlo. Back on the starship, newly demoted fighter pilot Po (Oscar Isaac) tries to win over Leia and her second in command (Laura Dern). Writer-director Rian Johnson (Looper, the famous “The Fly” episode of Breaking Bad) at times overreaches trying to balance these separate storylines and myriad of characters into one cohesive unit. Lupita Nyong’o has nothing to do in her glorified cameo appearance, while the Del Toro section fails to reach its potential. The result is a bloated running time of about 2 ½ hours — that includes about seven different points in which I was sure the movie was going to end only to see it continue to plow ahead. You always want your Star Wars films to move at light speed, not drag in the middle. When the two plots do intersect, it’s flat-out electric. Anyone well-versed in creator George Lucas’ original 1977-83 trilogy know that the sandwiched installment, The Empire Strikes Back, is the meanest of the trilogy. (Three words: Frozen Han Solo.) Whereas The Force Awakens mirrored the original Star Wars in the nuts and bolts of the story, perhaps that it’s only fitting that The Last Jedi deep dives into unsettled drama. Driver, in particular, gives Kylo Ren dimension far beyond that of a spoiled brat villain in over his helmet. As the grandson of Darth Vader but the son of Han Solo and Leia, his allegiance is constantly tested. Yet never forget the sci-fi saga is rooted in fun. There’s delight within the darkness, evidenced by the jokey one-liners and gee-whiz action sequences that fly at a furious pace. Ridley and Hamill use stinging barbs to develop their mentor-mentee relationship. (Snipes Luke, “Everything you just said is wrong!”) Indeed, an emotional moment decades in the making is punctuated with a punchline. I won’t dare reveal it, only to say that I’m willing to bet money that Fisher, a renowned wit, ad-libbed it. Even the Porgs, those big-eyed owl-like creatures, get grown-up laughs. They’re not nearly as distracting as the Ewoks! As a kid, Johnson played with Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo action figures and a toy Millennium Falcon in his backyard in California. He has a special connection to Star Wars, and it’s why The Last Jedi at its heart is a love letter to a childhood. From Luke’s sly wink to an old friend to General Leia’s respected, thoughtful leadership, the familiar heroes dominate the screen, earn the biggest applause and serve as a compass to the next generation. That crew will shine on its own soon enough. We hope."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"The Last Jedi opens up with one of the best space fights the series has seen, and it carries that quality throughout. It has one of the best light saber fights, one of the best endings, and some of the most fun the series has seen."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Disney are putting Santa to shame this year - because The Last Jedi is the Christmas present all Star Wars fans have been waiting for. The long-awaited Episode VIII is a spectacular addition to the long running sci-fi action adventure series. It is wonderfully exciting, funny and moving, and often at the same time. It provides top-drawer popcorn entertainment for the casual cinema goer, while hardcore fans will love it for the respect it has for the franchise history and for what it promises for the future. There is self sacrifice, bravery, huge explosions, lightsabers and space battles. Characters develop and, yes, are killed off. Old crowd favourites unexpectedly return and new ones are introduced. Younger fans will love the cutesy penguin-like Porgs, and droid BB-8, who became an overnight sensation with 2015’s The Force Awakens, has a starring role. The action then picks up immediately after The Force Awakens, with the legions of the evil First Order having imposed a reign of terror over the galaxy far, far away. Fisher, who tragically died after filming finished, seals her legacy as the one Disney Princess all young girls should look up to - as Leia deftly wields her blaster and keeps an eye on Oscar Isaac’s swashbuckling space pilot, Poe Dameron. The swaggering hotshot has an endearing propensity to blow things up as a first response in a crisis. Meanwhile Fisher's real life daughter Billie Lourd has a minor role as a resistance lieutenant. They share a poignant moment and more than one scene, and Lourd is hopefully being lined up to play a bigger role in the next film, due in 2019. Laura Dern is full of forthright steely elegance as Organa's Vice Admiral. It's refreshing to have two women of a certain age in key roles in major film. Organa is convinced her self-exiled twin brother and Jedi master Luke Skywalker will return to bring a spark of hope to the resistance, and has sent Daisy Ridley's Rey to recruit him. After being teased with his brief appearance in The Force Awakens, Mark Hamill embraces his return to the character which made him famous, and he's never been this much fun on screen. Age suits him. I'm not sure I believe what we're offered as the truth about the orphaned Rey's parents, as many different versions of the truth are provided during the story. The script delights in teasing us and wrong- footing us, and constantly toys with our knowledge of what's gone before and plays with our expectations. While respectful to the mythic past, it keeps puncturing the legends which have congealed around these famous characters, none of which are perfect. Many characters are conflicted and/or cagey in their motives and in many cases we're never sure which way they will turn. All of this snowballs into an avalanche of doubt in the audience's mind, making the finale all the more nail-biting. For a huge film it's surprisingly nimble. So many conflicts are set up it's astonishing there's time enough for them all to successfully pay off in the way they do. Ridley developed a brilliant chemistry with John Boyega in The Force Awakens. He returns as Finn and this time is teamed with Kelly Marie Tran as Rose, a member of the resistance who works in maintenance. Organa's evil and quick tempered son Kylo Ren - Adam Driver - isn't trusted by anyone. And his commander Lord Snoke is no longer a hologram but a flesh and blood being whose bold gold fashion sense suggests decadence has crept into the dark side. By necessity of being the middle part of a trilogy, this is not a triumphant film and is closer to the spirit of my favourite Star Wars episode, 1980's The Empire Strikes Back. Princes William and Harry visited the set during filming but we can't tell if their much hyped cameos made it onto the screen. Anyway it's not as Star Wars needs the publicity. Writer-director Rian Johnson keeps the film fresh while working within rigid constraints laid down by existing Star Wars lore and the dictates of the powerful Disney empire. Although dark at times, the film is a hymn to the power of stories to encourage us to dream, to believe we can change our world for the better."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," “The Last Jedi” looks like a work of fine science-fiction art, takes key characters to really conflicted places, revitalizes old action tropes such as lightsaber fights and wrecking big space vessels in imaginative new ways and even, even imbues all that Force nonsense with some solid spiritual wisdom. In other words, it’s not just a nostalgia-servicing exercise or gigantic toy ad (porgs notwithstanding, though even those comic cuddle objects are kept to a judicious minimum). Rather than go all simpleminded on the good vs. evil issue, “The Last Jedi” instead projects something like an understanding of actual human nature. That’s new. Shows what putting a writer/director with a distinctive vision and a mature sense of narrative, in this case Rian Johnson, in charge of the most corporate of moviemaking endeavors can achieve. George Lucas, and certainly J.J. Abrams, should study “Last Jedi” and learn. Most of all, so should Lucasfilm boss Kathleen Kennedy. She seems to have gotten the message about Johnson, whom she recently put in charge of a new trilogy. Now if she’d only stop whacking other cool directors from “Star Wars” films. Because, obviously, whether or not fans who just want more childish space odyssey swing with Johnson’s character-based storytelling and sophisticated visuals, the machine that makes these movies kind of owes it to the universe to at least explore its main themes more deeply from time to time. That’s exactly what Johnson does here, and he comes up with clean, more persuasive and compelling riffs on those familial and political ideas Lucas and his successors have doodled around with – sometimes elaborately but always superficially – for decades. Luke Skywalker’s tortured relationship with the whole Jedi thing gets worked out in agonizing detail this time around, and Mark Hamill plays it like you’d expect, i.e. as someone who’s been waiting for decades to tear into this stuff with everything he’s got. There’s a tragic gravity to Luke’s guilt and regrets not found anywhere else in “Star Wars.” But don’t worry fun-seekers, Hamill still knows how to be funny as hell and, better, when. I’m not spoiling anything by telling you Luke spends a lot of time training Daisy Ridley’s Rey in the ways of the knights, nor that she’s an apt pupil. But the two of them have more interesting stuff than that going on, and Ridley proves herself marvelously capable of dicing complicated thought with minimal muss or fuss. Strategic underplaying also works wonders for Adam Driver, whose Kylo Ren comes back from “The Force Awakens” more confused than ever, though dangerously determined when you think he can’t get any worse. Yes, the family tension (ha, that’s putting it mildly) between Luke, Kylo and Leia plays out pretty satisfactorily. Fans of the late Carrie Fisher may be disappointed that Leia is essentially written out of “Last Jedi’s” second act, but Fisher still delivered enough weary maternalism as the rebel leader to carry us into whatever the “Star Wars” future holds. As for her rebels, most of ’em find cool things to do as an unbeatable (ha, again) First Order armada chases their remnants through the heavens. Oscar Isaacs’ hotshot Poe displays Captain Kirk-level commitment and cunning while causing all kinds of trouble. Turncoat storm trooper Finn (John Boyega) still may have his priorities straight, but for whose benefit? Newcomer Kelly Marie Tran comes on all fangirl goofy as maintenance worker Rose Tico, but steels up quick like the good audience surrogate she’s designed to be. My favorite among the new castmembers is Laura Dern as Leia’s Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, a poker player of near-Vulcan inscrutability. Benicio Del Toro easily infects us with the fun he’s having on his visit from Marvel’s outer space universe. And although he was partially spotted in “The Force Awakens,” Andy Serkis really has a bastardly ball in a much-expanded, performance-capture appearance here as the manipulative Supreme Leader Snoke. You may have noticed that I’ve made a few “Star Trek” references. I’m not confusing the two properties. It really seemed to me that Johnson applied some good ideas from Gene Roddenberry’s baby to Lucas’: no-big-deal inclusiveness, a bit more reliance on at least buyable physics, an alien city that looks like us humans might have built. This is no more evident than in the sleeker, often boldly hued designs that now rub shoulders with “Star Wars’” traditional, Brutalist grunge. Whoever figured out how to use red in “The Last Jedi” – could it have been Louboutin? – deserves all the prizes. Crimson colors many key scenes, lending familiar compositions new vibrancy and enhancing the sense of a life-and-death interplanetary struggle that, until now, has been portrayed way too bloodlessly."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Whet by the  confidence booster of the $2billion-grossing The Force Awakens, writer-director Rian Johnson  is feeding the appetite of millions of fans expecting another Empire Strikes Back — and they pretty much get it. And Rey is . . . well, Rey. She  is still standing on the remote planet Ahch-To trying to pass a lightsaber to a grizzled and confused Luke Skywalker. For most of the 152 minutes, the groups stay where they are and with who they’re with, fighting their own separate battles — be they actual or metaphorical — before reuniting for the greatest stand-off since Darth and Obi-Wan. While the structure and pacing is borne from the imminent threat facing The Resistance and its race to escape the clutches of evil brings much of the action we love Star Wars for, the real heart of the movie is found on that remote island and we learn why Luke has become a grizzled recluse. It’s here that the intentions of Johnson and Disney become clear. We’re no longer on such a nostalgic sugar rush as we were two  years ago. The script is so good — holding  a mirror to modern-day Earth  and bringing a real humanity to  the saga. Its turn of phrase and comic timing allows characters such as General Hux, Finn and even Chewbacca to attain  real depth. It’s the funniest Star Wars film by   a million parsecs, but there’s always the  terrifying Snoke to remind you the Dark Side is never far away. Most work immediately (hello to the porgs and the excellent Rose played by Kelly Marie Tran). Others feel underused (the baddie droid BB-9E is as scarce as fan favourite Captain Phasma) and some just don’t work at all (Benicio Del  Toro’s DJ). Leading the front, though, are some truly astounding performances from Mark Hamill, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver — with the  latter’s Kylo Ren worthy of an award or two. Yes, it’s probably half an hour too long. There is  a whole section that feels out of kilter and harks back  to the CGI naffness of the prequels  — and is  also virtually pointless to the plot. A quick blast through my favourite moments: Chewbacca by a campfire, a shoulder brush, a wink, the best lightsaber moment ever, the many cameos, the salt-crusted planet, an old friend saying hello­ . . . and Leia. There are two moments in the film that are incredibly hard to watch but hammer home exactly how much Star Wars means to so many people. In one, Leia becomes the superhero we always knew she was. And her final exchange with a certain character will have you catching your breath at the poignancy and weight of the words."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," The solid foundations on which the rebooted Star Wars franchise has been carefully built will not be crumbling any time soon, if the latest episode in the beloved outer space series is anything to go by. The Last Jedi sports dazzling special effects work, interestingly well-rounded characters and second-to-none action, with a cynical harder edge that lifts it out of the blockbuster comic-book arena. And with events taking place all over the galaxy, the adventure this time takes on an extra epic dimension. This mid-section marker in the current trilogy simply doesn't disappoint, realising the courage of its convictions with an intelligent story and a heart-swelling emotional resonance. Much like The Empire Strikes Back (itself the second episode in the first classic trilogy), The Last Jedi is split into several plotlines. We follow the quests of various key characters, which all converge in one satisfying ensemble ending – a bittersweet closer if ever there was one. The Resistance against the First Order is on its last legs and General Leia (Carrie Fisher) is the only one protecting the line of defence. As “trigger happy flyboy” Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) takes out an enemy Dreadnought craft, little does he know he’s playing straight into the hands of Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson). Leia is injured in battle, with Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern) taking command, but Dameron has no faith in her decisions. Could mutiny be in the air? Meanwhile, on that remote island seen at the end of The Force Awakens, Rey (Daisy Ridley) is trying to convince a self-exiled Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to join Leia’s righteous cause. But Luke is in turmoil because of his past failings with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and is convinced the Jedi line needs to end. Will Rey develop her newly discovered abilities with Luke’s guidance even though he’s unsettled by the strength of her powers? Finn (John Boyega) learns about a chink in the First Order’s fleet. Together with besotted engineer Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), he searches for a master code-breaker to disable the tracker mission device that is sabotaging Resistance escape strategies. But is the genius DJ (Benicio del Toro) someone they can rely on? The Last Jedi is an involving yarn, tremendously well told, which throws in Easter Egg curve balls to add the kind of exhilarating texture that ardent fans adore. For that we have to thank writer/director Rian Johnson. His earlier films Brick and The Brothers Bloom showed he was smart and sharp, while Looper demonstrated his sci-fi chops. But never have his visuals, clever wit (Galaxy Quest comes to mind a few times!) and storytelling melded together so harmoniously as they do here. Every frame contains something of importance, relevance or interest. Johnson can be uber-flashy one moment (the outer space Monaco-like gambling hub, with its vast casinos and exotic creatures, is A New Hope's cantina scene beautifully upgraded and re-imagined) and deadly dramatic the next (Kylo Ren and Rey’s combative telepathic connections are truly breathtaking). Johnson brings an artful impact to every special effects set-piece, helped in no measure by his cinematographer of choice, Steve Yedlin. The action simply leaps from the screen (even without 3D glasses), whether during the exciting lightsaber battles, the audacious weaponsing of light speed, Rey’s self-reflecting mirror moment or when pulling out the fairy-tale stops to portray Leia’s misfortune. It's great to see Mark Hamill back in the Skywalker saddle, albeit now riddled with self-doubt and a broken spirit. But it’s hard to watch every Carrie Fisher scene without feeling a nostalgia-tinged sadness (The Last Jedi is dedicated to her in a lovely end credit). Heritage characters aside, this is most definitely Adam Driver’s finest hour. His conflicted villain is quite the best new-wave Star Wars creation of them all. Evil emanates from his every pore, despite tiny notes of regret peeping through at key times, and the grim grit he manifests in his beautifully rendered salt desert showdown with Luke will bring audible gasps. This hugely anticipated return to a galaxy far, far away goes deliciously deeper and darker into allegorical space fantasy and the human/alien condition than ever before, and only serves to strengthen the myth-making qualities that creator George Lucas recognised in the genre 40 years ago. Primarily, though, it’s a celebratory reunion of a universe and its treasured characters that have already redefined popular cinema culture. The Star Wars saga gets richer, more accomplished and elaborate with The Last Jedi and proves that when film-makers with Johnson’s enormous skill manage to balance the visceral with the cerebral, they come up with one extraordinary entertainment."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Days removed from seeing Star Wars: The Last Jedi, I still can’t believe it’s a real movie. I can’t believe what writer-director Rian Johnson did: He took all of our preconceived notions of what a Star Wars movie is and evolved them.  The movie is genuinely shocking at times—multiple times—but it also feels fully authentic to the Star Wars universe. And this is why The Last Jedi is so good, even if there are a few hiccups along the way. The Last Jedi picks up right where The Force Awakens left off. The Resistance has won an important victory against the First Order by blowing up Starkiller Base, but lost its allies in the New Republic. At the same time, Rey has finally tracked down Luke Skywalker, hoping to enlist his help. Those two storylines make up the bulk of the movie and Johnson hits the ground running with both. He instantly creates a tense, engaging tone for the film, because from moment to moment, you truly don’t know what’s going to happen next. Any time things seem to be going one direction, they don’t just zig or zag, they blast off into another dimension entirely. And it happens again and again. For example, parts of the film are very funny—like, almost too funny. The humor can, at times, feel overboard from what we’re used to in Star Wars. And yet it works. Then there are parts of the film that are incredibly weird and almost surreal—moments that seem more fit for an avant-garde movie. But they work too, because the very nature of Star Wars is that anything is possible. From scene to scene Johnson is basically saying, “Look, if we can have talking slugs, laser swords, and lightspeed, why can’t I do this?” And then he does it.  Thankfully, all that quirk and surprise never comes at the expense of spectacle, and The Last Jedi has plenty of it. Epic lightsaber fights, huge space battles, one-on-one duels—there’s rarely a moment when something amazing isn’t happening onscreen. And yet, that Star Wars iconography is always punctuated with Johnson’s personality. John Williams’ excellent score can be soaring on the soundtrack, or some familiar setting or ship can show up, and Johnson still manages to put his own unique spin on it. The film’s epic 150-minute runtime allows plenty of room for  Johnson’s  inventiveness, but there’s also a tiny bit of fat in the middle of the movie, specifically in the Canto Bight scenes with Finn and Rose. The casino city itself is gorgeous and has some crazy-cool characters, plus Finn and Rose’s presence there shines a light on some new, worthwhile themes for the Star Wars franchise. However, in terms of the overall story, the whole escapade feels a little pointless and small. It doesn’t help that Benicio del Toro’s new character, DJ, who is part of the same storyline, is largely insignificant. Everyone else in the movie is given heightened significance, though. If you loved what Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver did with Rey and Kylo Ren in The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi is going to blow you away, as both characters evolve in mesmerizing ways. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) has tons more to do and we’re all better for it. The same goes for General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), who is arguably the funniest character in the film, as well as Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), who is deliciously evil and confident. And while Finn and Rose might not have the best storyline overall, John Boyega and Kelly Marie Tran are each wonderful throughout it. Their chemistry feeds into the energy that permeates The Last Jedi. Finally, Laura Dern’s new character, Vice Admiral Holdo, gives the film a strong new leader and some of the movie’s best scenes. Then, of course, there’s Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher. Hamill’s return to Luke Skywalker is as complex a performance as we’ve ever seen in a Star Wars movie. You can feel the conflict and pain on his face in every scene. Fisher too has an expanded role, and the more she does and says as General Leia, the more emotional the movie gets, resulting in a worthy farewell performance. Once The Last Jedi kicks into its final act, the film’s somewhat saggy middle is forgotten and forgiven. The final hour or so of the film is filled with truly intense and shocking moments—all while Johnson also finds time to examine more complex things that Star Wars has never dealt with before, like celebrity, war profiteering, and the importance of letting go of the past. By combining the spectacle and this thoughtfulness, Johnson has made the entire experience of The Last Jedi incredibly rewarding. “Experience” is a good word for it, too, because that’s what The Last Jedi feels like. It’s a movie, sure, but it’s somehow more than that. Maybe that’s just because it’s Star Wars. Maybe that’s because it’s so densely packed with mythology and entertainment. But either way, The Last Jedi is a top-of-the-line, A-plus Star Wars and scifi movie—one that we’ll be watching and discussing for as long as there’s a galaxy far, far away."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Never has a Star Wars movie had so many questions to answer – about Rey, Snoke, Luke, the ancient Jedi, the Force, Leia's fate, bromances and so much more... Ryan Johnson has promised there will be some major casualties in this movie. Mark Hamill and his alter-ego Mr Skywalker has warned that things will not go as you expect. The trailer previews had hinted at the powerful action scenes, but this is a magnificent, nail-biting sequence that hammers home the terrible sacrifice and deadly danger the tiny rebel forces face. It also reintroduces Leia as an inspiring, almost mythical figurehead for hope and freedom, contrasted with Kylo Ren’s tortured state of permanent emo-angst. Adam Driver excels in this role in a way that Hayden Christensen only dreamed of back in his “I hate sand” teenage trauma. These will be two of the central themes of the entire movie. It is all about the Skywalkers, even as Luke hides away, Leia steps up in a majestic and deeply moving final performance from Carrie Fisher. No spoilers but just WAIT For one Leia scene in particular. It is nothing fans have ever seen before and an absolutely jaw-dropping reminder that she also carries the same powerful bloodline. It is a painful hint of what could have been explored more in Episode 9. The other Skywalker twin, Luke, is as a grumpy as the trailers have hinted. He is a figure of despair and disillusion and Hamill turns in the performance of his life that builds to an extraodinary final scene that is sure to divide fans for years to come. As for Rey, the big question is whether she is a hero or budding villain. Actually the big question has always been about her parents. It is finally answered after a lot of teasing that is spun out for virtually the entire movie so that by the time the truth is unveiled it has far too much to deliver. Again, when it finally comes, it is definitely one of those “not what you expected” moments. Daisy Ridley is fine in the role, but somehow hasn’t built on a stirring debut in The Force Awakens. She is resolute and sturdy but not inspiring. A real delight is Rose, played with humour and heartache by Kelly Marie Tran. Laura Dern also impresses as Vice Admiral Holdo in a deceptively powerful performance that finally builds to a hell of a pay-off.  Benicio del Toro’s DJ is as slippery and strange as hinted and he turns out to be… well, let’s just say he stays true to his nature. The much-lauded scenes on Canto Bight are strangely rushed and fail to impact as much as the lavish set designs and costumes deserve. A sub-plot about plucky local orphans feels a tad mawkish (and the spectre of child Anakin looms large). Speaking of spectres, everyone has been hoping for a major Force ghost reveal. There is an huge moment when a major figure from the past features that is by turns whimsical and impressive but to say any more would spoil the fun. It's impossible to completely move away from the Skywalker legacy but the dynamic between Rey and Kylo Ren is fixed on the future as much as the past. It introduces a disturbing and deceptive new slant that is very welcome and redefines our notions of good and evil, Light and Dark. Indeed, the most impressive aspect of the movie is the constant unsettling sensation that nobody (the characters included) is sure which way anything will go. For a deeply formulaic franchise this is a a phenomenal achievement. Yes, some beloved and not so beloved characters move on and there is another spectacular battle scene to finish it all off, but even then Johnson subverts our expectations for the final big reveal. In a flurry of stunning set-pieces and gorgeous cinematography everything distils down to one last encounter. It is worth the wait, stunningly filmed and then pulls the rug out from under the audience one last time. Some fans will definitely not be happy. The movie suffers a little from uneven pacing and occasionally lost my focus here and there but it is a worthy addition to the canon. As for those porgs, I’m afraid I remain as indifferent as I have from the beginning. All I can say is that Chewbacca has the right idea, involving an open fire and a skewer. Not all the slightly over-egged humour works, and Domhall Gleeson's twitching Hux runs the risk of becoming faintly ridiculous at times, but there is some compensation in a breathtakingly cheeky scene involving an iron that sent a wave of guffaws aroudn the audience."

Warning: This review includes minor spoilers so if you don’t want to know anything about the plot before you see it, go away now or watch the review video below instead which is spoiler-free! What the hell has happened to Luke Skywalker? That was the question that haunted all two-hours-and-16-minutes of Star Wars: Episode 7 – The Force Awakens, and never more so than in the last couple of minutes, when Luke (Mark Hamill) finally pitched up on the far-flung oceanic planet of Ahch-To not as the self-assured, optimistic Jedi Knight we left partying on Endor at the close of Return of the Jedi, but as a grey-bearded monk who’s retreated from the world(s). Eyes hooded and haunted, face as craggy as the cliff beneath his feet, he turned to suspiciously eye new heroine Rey (Daisy Ridley) as she offered the thrilling invitation – to viewers, if not to him – of once more clutching his lightsaber. Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the eighth canonical episode in the saga, is the first to continue right from where its predecessor left off. But before we get to the little matter of whether Luke accepts or rejects Rey’s offer, we first see General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) lead the First Order in an attack on a secret base that harbours General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) and the last of the Resistance.  Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and BB-8 take the fight straight back to Hux, piloting an X-Wing at a Dreadnaught cruiser to neutralise its surface cannons. They return to base just as Stormtrooper-turned-Resistance fighter Finn (John Boyega) awakens from the coma that claimed him at the end of Episode 7. “Where’s Rey?” he asks. And so it’s back to Ahch-To, where Rey is determined to tag everyone’s favourite Jedi Master back into the galactic wrestling match, or to at least twist his robot arm into training her in the ways of the Force, as Yoda once trained him. All she knows of said Force is “It’s a power that lets you control people and makes things float,” so she sure needs a little mentoring – and besides, as she succinctly puts it, “I’ve seen your daily routine and you’re not busy.” Meanwhile, Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) is no longer hiding behind a giant hologram but instead seated in a starkly modernist chamber painted a strikingly fascistic shade of red, scolding Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) for losing his Starkiller Base lightsaber duel to Rey. “You’re just a child in a mask,” he snarls, fixing his apprentice with wonky eyes as the crevasse in his forehead twists in a furious frown. Kylo must win back Snoke’s trust, and killing Rey, his ex-mentor Luke, and every last Resistance fighter is the way to do it. This is all just the first 30 minutes of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, and is actually the slowest part of the movie. The next two hours zip by like the Millennium Falcon acing the Kessel Run, as writer/director Rian Johnson – something of a Padawan when it comes to films of this scale, having previously made Brick, The Brothers Bloom, and Looper – crosscuts between sub-plots like a magician executing an immaculate riffle-shuffle.  Everyone’s favourites have key parts to play, with the aforementioned characters joined by Chewie (Joonas Suotamo), BB-8, R2-D2, C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and, with more impact this time, Stormtrooper commander Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie). Hell, even pirate queen Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong’o) rocks up… as do a host of famous fans and guest stars, but we’ll leave you to discover those ones for yourselves. The new characters, meanwhile, are attention-grabbers – and we don’t just mean the cute Porgs (mercifully not overused), crystal foxes, and a veritable menagerie of creatures and droids. Best of the bunch is Leia’s right-hand woman Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern, giving the galaxy a shock of purple hair and its sharpest cheekbones since Peter Cushing’s Grand Moff Tarkin), whose tactics to keep the Resistance out of the First Order’s iron fist are not to the liking of Poe, whom she labels “a trigger-happy flyboy”.  Maintenance worker Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) teams up with Finn to undertake a death-defying mission that recalls a cheeky operation conducted by Luke and Han in Episode 4. And helping, or perhaps hindering, them is ace hacker DJ (Benicio Del Toro), a conniving chancer they track down on the casino planet of Canto Bight (think Star Wars’ cantina writ large and spliced with a scene of a tuxedoed Bond seated at the tables). Johnson, as we know from all three of his previous movies, is a master of misdirection, oh-so dexterous when it comes to sleight-of-hand storytelling full of breakneck twists and hairpin turns. The Last Jedi is no different, packed with subterfuge and shocks. If J.J. Abrams’ The Force Awakens was exactly what everyone needed after George Lucas’ plastic prequels – a glorious love letter to the original trilogy that dotted every ‘I’ and crossed every ‘T’ in a familiar hand – then The Last Jedi, though every inch a Star Wars movie, propels the saga forward in unexpected ways.  It’s not so much darker, à la The Empire Strikes Back, for it’s the funniest Star Wars film by far, and Johnson was vocal about wishing to avoid “heaviosity”. But it is deeper, delving into the nature of the Force and what it means to be a Jedi, a religion that is thousands of generations old, and concentrating intently on themes of family, myth, identity, treachery, loyalty, and sacrifice. There are astonishing set-pieces, including at least three up-there-with-the-best ‘saber duels (one has more than a hint of Kill Bill’s House of Blue Leaves rip-roaring carnage) and the climactic battle, glimpsed in the trailer, which hurls TIE fighters, the Millennium Falcon, AT-M6s (the new AT-ATs) and more at each other over a desert-scape that churns up the red stain of violence. But the real drama is in the faces, as Johnson locks in his unwavering close-ups to explore the cloudy planets of Luke’s eyes, the glimmering lakes of Rey and Kylo’s tears.  Who are Rey’s parents? Will Kylo walk into the light, or Rey be swallowed by darkness? And what really happened when Ben Solo spurned Luke’s tutelage and fled to Snoke? This last is revisited several times from different perspectives – surely a nod to Akira Kurosawa’s truth-prodding Rashomon, just as Lucas took so much of his iconography, wipe-and-swipe edits (again in evidence here) and the relationship between C-3PO and R2-D2, from the Japanese master. But the final word must go to Leia, to whom the film is movingly dedicated. Carrie Fisher here gives a performance of tremendous dignity, wisdom, and love, and is awarded at least three scenes that serve as a fitting goodbye to the fans’ Princess. Her journey from princess to senator to rebel to general of the Resistance is now done and, in a movie that discusses myth-making and the differences between a legend and a relatable, everyday person with hopes and dreams, weaknesses and tenacity, she proves again that she is both.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"Taken as a whole, this eighth episode of the franchise will be porgnip for the faithful, though the answer to one of its Big Questions seems disappointing, and generously entertaining for the rest of us."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," For those hoping that there may have been a substantial uptick in quality between J.J. Abrams’s The Force Awakens and Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi—in much the same way that The Empire Strikes Back improved on Star Wars—you may need a new hope. The latest entrant in this now-Disney-owned franchise is largely content to further the themes and narrative strategies of its predecessor: Johnson, a filmmaker who proved capable of crafting individualistic, tightly wound sci-fi with 2012’s Looper, too often seems to think that the best he can bring to Star Wars is an amped-up version of Abrams’s overly reverent tribute to George Lucas’s original films. The Last Jedi’s manically paced first 90 minutes include two lengthy spacecraft battles and at least three independent plotlines. Johnson makes a great effort to leaven the freneticism of this chaos by indulging in a handful of comic set pieces: The film’s first scene is an extended crank-call joke, and there are several petty disses directed at a “new Vader” who isn’t quite filling his grandfather’s oversized helmet. But these moments feel like exaggerations of things Abrams did in The Force Awakens—with the wry self-awareness coming off as more tiresome by comparison, since this franchise should feel less burdened by now with the task of establishing itself and its lineage. The good news is that Johnson has a bit more of his own plan here than the first half of his film suggests: The Last Jedi becomes essentially bifurcated, thanks to one decisive, unexpected break from this series’s tradition-bound progression that reverberates across the film’s various narrative threads. But The Last Jedi’s two-and-half-hour sprawl still includes an awful lot of clunky, derivative, and largely unnecessary incidents to wade through in order to get to its maverick last act. This is especially true when it comes to the plausibility-straining mission of stormtrooper turned Rebel Alliance fighter Finn (John Boyega) and puckish series newcomer Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran). In order to hack into, what else, a giant battleship, the two young recruits are first dispatched to a nearby planet with a lavish casino run by rich arms dealers—who, it turns out, profit from supplying weapons to both sides of the galaxy’s seemingly eternal good-versus-evil conflict. Johnson establishes the opulent casino space with a gliding push-in, whizzing past an array of inventive creatures and costumes, in a scene that’s very much designed to capture the bustling feel of Chalmun’s Cantina, from the original Star Wars (but in a far more socially upscale context). After this shot, though, the setting is largely discarded, as Johnson abruptly refocuses on, and hastily defines, an underground culture of enslaved children and racing llama-like beasts. The film sidles up to an anti-colonialist sentiment but doesn’t devote it any time, instead spending its energy on a CGI llama stampede. There’s a very good 90-minute version of The Last Jedi that strips out the extraneous subplots and zeroes in on the emotionally compelling relationship between self-assured hero Rey (Daisy Ridley) and the vulnerable villain, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). While Rey spends much of her time in the film with her new master, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill)—on that remote planet she landed on at the end of The Force Awakens—she finds herself able to telepathically link with Kylo Ren. The two rivals’ shared scenes boast a surprising tenderness and intensity, thanks largely to Johnson’s careful framing, which puts the viewer just off axis enough from the actors’ eyelines to avoid the breaking of the fourth wall but still conveys a creepy sense of closeness. The Last Jedi does pull many of its disparate parts together in its markedly stronger final stretch, which also happens to include the film’s two best set pieces: a lightsaber duel in a Twin Peaks-like red room and an impeccably paced airship battle through a sprawling, crimson-dyed mineral mine. But Johnson’s ambitions here can easily be over-sold: Most of the surprising plot twists and character developments that eventually enliven The Last Jedi walk back their radical implications on the story, and revert to the resolutions we’ve come to expect from a trilogy beholden to recycling its themes of misplaced hope and heroic sacrifice. Three films into the Disney Star Wars era, there have been enough unique elements introduced to this familiar world to suggest the kind of ways Star Wars could grow and change. But there’s also been resistance to letting those elements escape an oppressive sameness."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," ‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi” unspools like a one-movie binge watch, a lively if overlong and busily plotted second chapter to the latest Star Wars trilogy that advances the story and deepens its characters with a combination of irreverent humor and worshipful love for the original text. Written and directed by Rian Johnson (""Looper""), this installment picks up literally where 2015's ""The Force Awakens"" left off. Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is still bringing the heat. His comrade — and reformed stormtrooper — Finn (John Boyega) is recuperating from a punishing last battle with the proto-fascist First Order. And a courageous orphan named Rey (Daisy Ridley) has finally tracked down Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) after vanquishing the maybe-evil, maybe-just-mixed-up Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) in a lightsaber duel. The moment in “The Force Awakens” when Luke, standing on an isolated island cliff, turns to see Rey for the first time was electrifying. Johnson punctuates it with a surprisingly cheeky gesture that sets the tone for a movie whose easygoing jocularity fits right in with the original movies’ jaunty pastiche of Eastern mysticism, cheesy B-movie ad­ven­ture, messianic theology and rusty, dusty retro-futurism. After getting things started with a well-choreographed battle scene (featuring a deliciously supercilious Domhnall Gleeson as the fatuous First Order leader General Hux), Johnson adroitly maneuvers his characters through a story that, admittedly, often feels more convoluted than canonically necessary, with extravagantly reckless tactical gambits, nail-biting tick-tocks and ludicrously protracted standoffs providing excuses for action and incident more than narrative drive. Still, “The Last Jedi” honors the franchise’s chief values of idealism, loyalty and self-sacrifice that made the original “Star Wars” so beloved, with a similarly appealing ragtag team of hotheads and cockeyed optimists to root for as they try to save their galaxy from totalitarian domination. For the most part, the ensemble still works: Isaac and his droid BB-8 still enjoy bro-ing out and, to quote Poe, jumping in an X-wing and blowing something up; Boyega, now separated from Rey, finds common cause with a plucky engineer named Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and, eventually, a sleepy-eyed mercenary named DJ (played with a stutter and strong dash of cynicism by Benicio Del Toro). The late, great Carrie Fisher delivers a magnificent and wryly funny final turn as General Leia Organa, who shares one of “The Last Jedi’s” finest scenes with Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, portrayed in lavender-haired splendor by Laura Dern. That moment is guaranteed to bring a lump to Star Wars skeptics and superfans alike, as will frequent callbacks to the original films — including a particular whopper — that feel like Johnson offering a reassuring ""I got you"" to a core audience that's been burned too often in the past. Some of his creations feel rote or shamelessly manipulative: a sequence set at a casino feels like a pale retread from the Mos Eisley cantina scene in ""A New Hope."" And the wide-eyed, owl-like porgs that populate Luke's island seem reverse-engineered to elicit immediate puppy love in the audience. Yet Johnson clearly understands a franchise that depends as much on improbable schemes and subplots as Oedipal rage and symbolic sibling rivalry for its energy and psychological pull. “The Last Jedi” looks great, its visual and sound design assembled with care and judicious taste. Ultimately, though, its ballast lies in the relationship between Rey and Kylo Ren, whose mysterious mind-meld is fleshed out and deepened, its mysterious origins cleared up only slightly. Whereas Driver has the kind of face and physical presence that lends itself to his character’s ambiguity, Ridley isn’t nearly as compelling this time out, perhaps because she spends most of the time being tutored by Luke. Luckily for Rey, there’s a third movie in her future. And it’s lucky for viewers, too. There’s no way for the latest trilogy of Star Wars films to capture the novelty and sheer exhilaration of the originals, but Johnson and producer J.J. Abrams understand the spirit and emotion of the thing. When the feelings come in “The Last Jedi,” and they do come, they’re deep and they’re real. Go ahead and try to watch the penultimate scene without crying, or pretending not to. And may the Force be with you."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," ★★★★★It took them 40 years, but they’ve finally done it. The best Star Wars film of the series. There. That’s it. It’s that simple. The Last Jedi, the ninth official movie (including last year’s unforgivable spin-off Rogue One) in a saga that launched the modern age of blockbusters, is a film of wit and wonder, of eye-gouging visual spectacle, and one that is buttressed by entirely unexpected and frequently devastating emotional power."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," If they are to successfully make the jump to light speed, Star Wars movies require a precisely calibrated fuel mixture: one-third epic space battles, one-third narrow escapes and duly buckled swashes, one-third hooded beardy dudes standing around looking pained while solemnly intoning the cheesiest hokum about Darkness and Light as if it's Hamlet's Yorick speech (which in a way, it is). Rian Johnson, director and writer of Star Wars: The Last Jedi (aka Episode VIII, aka The One Without Any Big Round Thing That Needs To Get Destroyed By Exploiting A Weakness In Its Design, Thank God) knows how vital each of those bedrock elements prove, and he has struck upon precisely the right alchemical formula without making a franchise film that feels formulaic. The Last Jedi is fun and fast, rollicking and suspenseful. It supplies us with all the things we expect — nay, demand — in a Star Wars movie, and manages to surprise us by revealing that this fictional universe, in which we've already clocked so many hours, can still surprise us. To do so, Johnson supplies two fuel additives to the existing mix. One, he leans into the sly, knowing sense of humor that was present in the original trilogy (""I love you."" ""I know.""), but that got dumbed way, way down in the prequels (""How wuuuude!"") and forcefully reawakened in J.J. Abrams' Star Wars: The Force Awakens (""Who talks first? Do you talk first or do I talk first?""). The Last Jedi is both jokier and funnier (two very different things) than The Force Awakens — there's a solid conference call bit in the first reel, for example, and later a very clever throwaway visual gag destined to join Raiders of the Lost Ark's ""interrogation device or coat hanger?"" sequence, in the admittedly tiny Cinematic Conflations of Torture and Clothing-Care Hall of Fame. The other thing Johnson introduces is something that the various Star Wars offshoots (novels, games, animated series, etc.) have explored, but that has been assiduously kept out of the main series' simple, rigorously Manichean Dark Side vs. Light Side infrastructure: grayscale. There is a welcome attempt, in The Last Jedi, to depict characters and their motivations in less stark and increasingly nuanced terms. This is both smart and inevitable, for a franchise that has hung around long enough for its themes and plot-beats to become as pervasive as these have. Yes, sure: Joseph Campbell, monomyth, Good and Evil, blah blah blah. These films do require a stark, easily apprehensible symbolic underpinning — but they also need to work as films, and that means having characters whose every choice we won't see coming, whose behaviors are not dictated by the color of their space-couture. In The Force Awakens, Adam Driver's Kylo Ren was evil, but (we were told, repeatedly) conflicted; here, he's conflicted, but evil — and this time we see and feel him struggle. (When he is not lashing out at underlings, or elevators — long story — Driver's Ren is amusingly albeit chillingly understated; he is your Bad Space Boyfriend, forever space-gaslighting you.) Fine, but what is it about? I'll keep things vague, but I can say that the bulk of the film is taken up by what is essentially a slow-speed chase — the tiny Resistance fleet, led by Gen. Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher), struggles to outrun the eeeeevil First Order, led by Gen. Hux (Domhnall Gleeson, reveling in sniveling). Along for the ride: Kylo Ren and his master, Supreme Leader Snoke (a CGI creation voiced by Andy Serkis), who turns out to be more given to swanning around the joint in a gold lamé kaftan than we had perhaps been led to expect. This is not a complaint. Everyone who was around when the Force got so rudely awakened is back, though they promptly get sorted into different plot threads. This time around, Poe (Oscar Isaac) proves himself as much a hothead as a hotshot. Ex-Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) gets paired up with Resistance backbencher/fangirl Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) on a mission that goes on a wee bit too long but that provides the film with the closest thing it gets to a vaguely political point of view — and another opportunity to underscore its emerging theme of moral relativism. And of course, there's Rey (Daisy Ridley), stuck on a gorgeous, remote, windswept island with Luke Skywalker himself (Mark Hamill), who is locked into the mode of Gruff Reluctant Mentor. Rey must implore him to teach her the ways of the Force, and he must refuse, until he doesn't, because even a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, there must have been kung fu movies that taught everyone the rhythm of these things. It's a testament to Johnson and his editor, Bob Ducsay, that a film so loaded with characters and storylines can feel as sleek and propulsive as this one. There is a moment at about the movie's midway point when all of its different threads reach a violent turning point. As we jump between them, their disparate events seem to layer atop one another, each cut increasing in pace and intensity until the shattering payoff(s); it's a mini-master class in storytelling, and the movie is not near done with us. Everyone gets a hero moment, a scene that showcases their respective, resplendent badassery, even, especially, Fisher's Leia — though hers does seem to belong to a wholly different film franchise (you'll know the one). Many of the questions raised in The Force Awakens receive their answers here — some with a very decisive, and surprising, finality. It will likely leave you wondering where the franchise is headed next — and that, in and of itself, in a film series that has gone on this long, filled with characters who wear black because they are capital-e Evil, is a bracingly positive turn of events that will send you from the theater filled with a new hope."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Everything comes down to hope. In these troubled times we live in, it’s all too easy to rest on pessimism. It’s easy to arch eyebrows and roll eyes, to close yourself off from the litany of cultural, social and political maladies in the name of self-preservation. Hope is difficult. Hope is painful. Hope means accepting that humans, for all their many, many faults, are a species that survives only on the notion that things can (and, with a little perseverance, will) get better. It’s this spark which has managed to sustain life for thousands of years – if nothing else, we’re a scrappy lot. Every single day we’re reminded of own our frailty and folly through a constant barrage of stories about the new and disturbing ways we find in which to tear ourselves and our planet apart. It’s easy to lose sight of the truth which has always been such: while a glimmer of hope survives, so do we. In Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson isn’t just selling us the latest instalment of a billion-dollar saga. He’s selling us the notion that surviving isn’t just something you do – it’s something you have to believe in. I didn’t always believe in survival. For a very long time, I believed in as close to nothing as a person can get. I credit many things with pulling me out of the horrific depression which consumed the majority of my youth, which made me scared and angry and sad, but most of all, feel the absence of emotion. The great void where you become so desperate to experience any sort of catharsis, you become unconcerned with the path that you take to get there. In The Last Jedi, the void is physical and metaphorical – and hope is the smallest Rey of light, defiant in the face of that which would see it extinguished. Picking up where The Force Awakens left off, we find our heroes scattered across the galaxy. Having found Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in his self-imposed exile, Rey (Daisy Ridley) sets about trying to convince him to return to the Rebellion to finish what he started. Flying ace Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) lead an attempt to shake the grip of the nefarious First Order, while reformed Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) wrestles with his identity. All the while, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) receives the performance assessment of the century from Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). In the director’s chair, Johnson appears unfazed by the daunting task of having to weave these narrative threads into a single coherent tapestry, evolving the developmental arcs of characters both new and old. It helps, of course, that he is blessed with an exceptionally talented cast. Isaac is given more screen time to be terminally dashing and well-meaning-to-a-fault, while Hamill’s return to the saga is treated with the just the right amount of reverence. Boyega strikes up an unlikely friendship with spiky newcomer Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) as they set off on a side mission of their own. In a franchise that has always celebrated outsiders and connected families, the easy chemistry and blossoming companionship of this pair is particularly poignant – as is the positioning of Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern) as a stern peer of Leia’s. More than ever the Resistance feels like a fleshed-out organisation in which there are no small roles. It feels like a family. Across the universe, Kylo Ren and Rey each struggle to find their place in the order of things. Driver continues to prove his might as the First Order’s enfant terrible – those big brown eyes swim with a conflict so palpable it might as well be a blaster shot straight to the chest. Ren might have been an angsty brat in The Force Awakens, but in The Last Jedi he’s wrestling with something much deeper than daddy issues. Similarly, Rey continues her personal quest, turning to Jedi Master Skywalker for guidance while striving to resist Ren’s magnetic pull. She sees in him what she sees in herself: a desperation to belong to something or somewhere. This conflict is well-established within the Star Wars realm, and just as young Skywalker looked to the binary sunset on Tatooine for his destiny, so do Ren and Rey. But nostalgia can only get you so far. The real success of The Last Jedi lies not in the affection it clearly holds for George Lucas’ original trilogy, but the way it manages to move the story forward. “Let the past die,” urges Ren, and he has a point. One of the criticisms levelled at The Force Awakens was that it felt too much like a greatest hits package tailored towards an audience who had grown up wielding plastic lightsabers around their backyard. Whether you agree with that sentiment or not, it’s difficult to level the same argument at The Last Jedi. The battle scenes are as thrilling as they’ve ever been, particularly the glorious white-and-red spectacle glimpsed in the film’s trailer. As in Johnson’s 2012 film Looper, each and every set-piece here is beautifully staged and never superfluous. Right from the opening scene, he puts his own stamp on proceedings without it ever seeming like an exercise in vanity. It’s little wonder he’s been entrusted with three more Star Wars films. The Last Jedi is a little rough around the edges. There’s a sense of narrative misdirection which grates slightly, and while not quite overlong, one or two scenes could have easily been cut for a leaner pace. The thing is, Star Wars has always been a bit messy, a little hokey even. If The Last Jedi were a person, it would be a gap-toothed child with a grin like an intergalactic sunrise – part of its charm is the unruly cowlick sticking up on its head. There’s no escaping the twin themes of birth and death which make The Last Jedi the most emotional instalment in the saga to date. Some things must die in order for Star Wars to progress, and it’s accepting this loss and how to move forward from it that enable us, like the franchise, to grow. Case in point: the loss of Carrie Fisher really hits home when you see her shine as Leia for one last time. But if Star Wars has taught us anything, it’s that death is never the end. That’s what hope is all about. Johnson nails the crucial moments in his script, creating a sense of slack-jawed wonderment not seen in this series since James Earl Jones uttered the immortal words: “I am your father.” He combines these with a healthy dose of intergalactic weirdness, including the Ewok-esque Porgs, which serve as a convenient merchandising point and source of light slapstick humour. One of the things that has always set Star Wars apart from similar sci-fi blockbusters is its total earnestness. It invites us to believe in a human struggle taking place in a fantastic setting. The Last Jedi is no exception, transporting us to distant reaches of a galaxy where anything is possible. Where anything has to be possible.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," There is a special, inherent challenge in crafting the second chapter of a story designed as a trilogy. As a direct sequel, its job is to adopt certain story threads from its predecessor and weave a unique, independent narrative. But traditionally, they're also meant to avoid certain firm conclusions and keep specific doors open so that they can be closed in the finale still to come. This is an issue that has long been associated with the Star Wars franchise, going back to 1980's The Empire Strikes Back. As iconic as that film is, and as much as it adds to the macro arc, it famously is much more about moving pieces around on a chess board than it is about telling a complete story. It's with that in mind that we come to writer/director Rian Johnson's Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the anticipated sequel to J.J. Abrams' Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which was designed with the intention of being released two years before the untitled Star Wars: Episode IX in 2019. Because of its position within the big picture scheme, many have naturally viewed the blockbuster with certain expectations -- fervently wondering which hotly debated franchise questions will be addressed, and which will be saved for the anticipated follow-up. It's an earned atmosphere generated from the love that the movies have inspired for decades... but watching the film you recognize that it fully expected those expectations. The ultimate trick is that Star Wars: The Last Jedi never fully leans into those history-driven anticipations, and walks away the better movie for it. Any time you think you have a full grasp on everything that's going to happen, it finds an avenue to subvert, and in the process both swiftly moves pacing-wise and builds characters in fascinating ways. To paraphrase Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker in the film, the movie doesn't go the way you think, and it coalesces as one of the most surprising and original titles in the saga. Impressively, the film isn't subtle about its awareness either -- going much further than Skywalker's aforementioned meta dialogue. Beginning from a timeline perspective, Star Wars: The Last Jedi breaks from tradition, being the first sequel that picks up immediately after the previous story. Opening heroic-yet-reckless maneuvers have immediate and shocking consequences. Even Luke's first reaction after being reunited with his long-lost Lightsaber goes down in a way that defies every prediction out there. It sets you up for what is an integral part of the fabric of the movie: a recognition that the universe is not black and white, and that just because you think you know what's going to happen because all evidence points one way doesn't mean that you actually fully recognize the reality of a situation. Without going full-bore into heavy plot details (it's a movie best seen knowing very little), there is a healthy number of subplots that keep the main characters engaged and active throughout a pressure-cooked narrative -- but it should be recognized that not all of the material is as strong as the rest. The best is represented by Rey, once again brought to life with an emotional, powerful turn by Daisy Ridley, who has far and away the strongest material in this movie. Paired with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to not only explore her personal, powerful connection with The Force, she's also positioned to understand what exactly happened between the legendary Jedi and his last student, the young Ben Solo a.k.a. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron, meanwhile, finds himself running into serious and surprising conflict within the hierarchy of the Resistance, with his hot shot attitude causing him to butt heads with not only General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), but the newly introduced Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern). In both cases, we see a natural extension of character arcs from Star Wars: The Force Awakens that do a fantastic job both moving the story forward and totally changing our perceptions of both heroes and villains. It's not all great, however, as Star Wars: The Last Jedi does have a clear weak spot -- specifically the side plot that develops between Finn (John Boyega) and newly-introduced Resistance member Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran). Following a genuinely funny meet-up between the two characters, they are given their own special mission searching for a codebreaker who can assist in the battle against the First Order. But this storyline never feels particularly inspired or impactful as everything else going down in the movie. While it is constructed to fit with the larger themes of the film, features its own interesting expectation-flipping turns, and does eventually have a key impact on the macro scale, it's also the only part of the feature that ever feels expendable, and not helping anything is that it features the weakest visual effects of the blockbuster (especially during a second-act chase sequence). While not every part of Rian Johnson's script plays precisely as you want, what he does truly nail with his chapter in the Star Wars saga is character development, following up on what was also the greatest strength of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Though the franchise has always been about the stark contrast between the Light and the Dark, Johnson uses The Last Jedi and its heterogeneous ensemble to ever so slightly muddy those waters, adding surprising complexity to our perspective of each individual, while never losing sight of what is good and what is evil. By the end of the story, both circumstances and particular revelations leave you looking at all of the main players in a completely different light, all of them set up for big things in the next chapter. Propped up by strong material, every member of the Star Wars: The Last Jedi cast delivers performances worthy of the iconic franchise, but deserving special mention is Mark Hamill. The Force Awakens was partially built as a showcase for Harrison Ford's Han Solo, and this new film is really the same thing for Luke Skywalker -- reminding the audience of everything we love about him while simultaneously challenging our principal perception. Luke has a much harder edge than when we last really saw him in Return of the Jedi, his relationship with Rey sometimes as coarse as sandpaper, but Hamill more than effectively brings back the spirit of the legendary hero, and it's a remarkable thing to see him back up on the big screen. Again, it's not everything that you're expecting, because that's not the game that this movie is playing, but that really just makes The Last Jedi better. In retrospect, Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a safe blockbuster, effectively riffing on and reflecting A New Hope while introducing audiences to a new generation of characters. Star Wars: The Last Jedi, however, does not play it safe. Not only are there no direct comparisons to make between it and any other story in the franchise, but the way it leaves things even prevents future chapters from trying to go back to that route.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," There are certain needs you expect to be met when stepping into the theater to see a STAR WARS movie. You want to experience the awesome thrill, sense the magical wonder and see the spectacular spectacle unfold before you. It’s supposed to be transportive in its ways of world-building and deeply impactful in terms of its narrative connotations. It’s a hero’s journey unlike any other. Though I’ve been left feeling out in the cold by THE FORCE AWAKENS, and practically frostbitten by ROGUE ONE, director Rian Johnson’s STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI gives off a significant more amount of heat than its modern era (i.e. Disney/ Lucasfilm era) predecessors. It certainly captures the sense of awe and imagination of what we love best about that universe. While it’s not entirely without faults, it is entirely entertaining. The First Order, led by Supreme Leader Snoke (voiced by Andy Serkis) and sniveling  General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), is quickly taking over, but not without the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), interfering with their oppressive domination. Characters are scattered all over. Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) are on different tangential quests. Some of their missions involve beloved characters like Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2 (Jimmy Vee) and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). One involves a planet-trotting adventure with new badass hero, Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran). And, of course, still as pissed off as ever, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is out to crush all hope left in that galaxy far, far away. Similar to THE FORCE AWAKENS, there are loads of thrilling sequences Johnson constructs that speak to the kid in all of us. It’s easy to get an electric charge from how he handles the necessary elements of homage. The unabashed fan service moments – whether that be through subtle, or not so subtle, callbacks to the original trilogy – don’t feel like an oppressive onslaught as they did in Episode VII. Johnson hooks his new, imaginative ideas into existing lore perfectly. And no need to worry about midichlorians here. They give us porgs and those don’t turn out to be anything less than splendid. What’s more is that Episode VIII excels even in the quiet, pensive, and restrained edges. There’s time for the gravitas of these characters’ actions to settle with the audience, where you feel the burden they’re shouldering. The thematic text speaks to the light and the dark in humanity – politically and socio-economically. Shades of black and white also color hustler DJ’s (Benicio Del Toro) worldview. The subtext takes on a poignant, almost meta quality in its sentiments about legends and their legacies. “Goose pimple worthy” fight sequences – the big action set pieces that make your eyes (and maybe mouth) widen in amazement – are sprinkled throughout assuring the audience they’ll never get bored. Johnson’s marvelous visuals work in tangent with John Williams’ resplendent score, augmenting the characters’ narrative drive. Nevertheless, there is one fight sequence that looks absolutely breathtaking, and will assuredly make you cheer at the fanfare (as the people in my screening did), but whose underlying motives may lead to some questions. During one particular montage, Johnson, along with editor Bob Ducsay, rhythmically cross-cut between the range of female personalities as a heartrending nod to these women’s empowered choices. While I do wish this sequence carried a bit more emotional heft in the build-up, I can’t help but commend it for being something the film makes room to acknowledge. That said, you might feel the push-pull of the story’s progressive, and unfortunately occasionally regressive, elements. Yes, we now have more dynamic, diverse, smart, strong female characters in this universe. However, take a closer look at how they’re utilized. One “smart, strong female character” heroically puts her life on the line for a dude for flimsy reasons. We’ll take it, but with a disclaimer attached. Another female character is noticeably undermined almost the entire time by a male character. His hero’s journey is laid out clearly in the beginning, with two women – on separate occasions – telling him to, as the phrase goes, “check yourself before you wreck yourself,” yet it’s very lax on arriving at any resolution (satisfactory or otherwise). The filmmakers never force (pun intended) him to learn anything from these warnings. This thread is left dangling in the wind, for now, at least. Perhaps it’s all fluid as these are episodic, but there’s no reason characters can’t learn different lessons in each episode. This seems to be how they’re advancing Rey’s character growth, so, you know, small blessings. Despite the gripes, overall, THE LAST JEDI is a force for positive change. There’s room to advance the franchise in new and exciting ways. It’s just a matter of whether or not they embrace the evolution."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," When it was released in 1977, the first Star Wars movie only bore the title Star Wars. Later, the subtitle A New Hope was added — and with it, a subtle intimation of what this series is all about. The Star Wars saga explores lots of ideas, but one it keeps cycling back to is the idea of hope. Where does it come from? Why? And when it looks like the last glimmer of hope has been extinguished, is there any reason to go on? For decades, each Star Wars installment has explored those ideas, moving from hope to despair and back again as a fundamentally moral political battle wages between a dark side bent on its own immense power and a scrappy bunch of rebels who dare to think everyone matters. And now, 40 years after it all started, the eighth installment in the Star Wars series, The Last Jedi, retreads that basic setup with a mastery that isn’t just reminiscent of the series’ best entries, but takes its place alongside them. ...that The Last Jedi picks up more or less exactly where The Force Awakens left off, with the evil First Order ready to strike back against Resistance forces in retaliation for destroying their superweapon, the Starkiller Base. The rebel army is still led by General Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher, in her final Star Wars appearance). Hotshot Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) — with his droid pal BB-8 — is out in front in the counterattack, going briefly rogue to accomplish his mission, while Finn (John Boyega) is healing from the wounds inflicted on him by Darth Vader heir-apparent Kylo Ren (Adam Driver, who continues to knock it out of the park).  Meanwhile, on the faraway planet Ahch-To, Rey (Daisy Ridley) — who now knows she can harness the Force herself — has just encountered Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and handed him his lightsaber.  The Last Jedi follows the resistance fighters as they struggle to survive through an increasingly painful series of blows, exacerbated by the First Order’s newfound ability to track their forces through hyperspace jumps. This realization sends Finn and ship’s engineer Rose (a fantastic Kelly Marie Tran) to a new planet where they search for someone who can help them. Meanwhile, though Rey and Kylo Ren are far away from one another, they seem to be experiencing a psychic connection that suggests the answers to some of their questions about themselves and each other may lie in surprising places. The strength of 2015’s The Force Awakens came from its careful retreading of ground that was already broken by earlier Star Wars films, in ways that pleased fans who were terrified this new trilogy would repeat the mistakes of George Lucas’s “prequel” trilogy. The Force Awakens calmed fears, reminded viewers why the series worked in the first place, and introduced a more diverse set of characters that made the whole Star Wars thing feel fresh and fun again. And yet, if The Force Awakens was a great variation on a theme, then The Last Jedi is another movement altogether in the symphony. There are images in this movie that provoke awe and delight, and creatures that feel lifted out of half-remembered childhood dreams. And though it briefly appears to lose steam in the middle, that’s short-lived, with a third act harboring sequences that feel like a maestro conducting a concerto the size of the cosmos.  There is catharsis aplenty, something the Star Wars movies are designed for, encouraging us to cheer when our favorite characters show up on screen and letting us thrill to the chases and the romance and the vistas and the explosions and the lightsaber battles. (This installment has one of the most purely perfect lightsaber battles the series has yielded thus far.) But as written and directed by Rian Johnson, The Last Jedi doesn’t just feel like a well-executed Star Wars movie — it feels like a well-executed movie, period, one that keeps its eye on the relationships between characters, and how they communicate with one another, in addition to the bigger picture.  Some of this has to do with the fact that The Force Awakens did the heavy lifting by introducing (or in some cases reintroducing) these characters to us, so Johnson doesn’t have to start from scratch. But one of Johnson’s strengths as a writer and director has always been injecting humanity and intelligence into characters who live inside familiar genres; they’re definitely characters, but they’re people, too. He knows how to make us feel for them. That means that a character like the loser General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson as a marvelous sad sap), locked in his eternal battle with Kylo Ren for dominance and the attention of Supreme Commander Snoke (Andy Serkis), is the butt of many jokes, but he also has a glimmer of the unwanted pet dog about him that lends a little pathos to our scorn.  It means we get a character like Rose, who trips believably over herself when she first meets Resistance Hero Finn, but quickly shows she’s brilliant, and has a strong and courageous side too. It means Luke becomes more than a reclusive hero-in-waiting, coming to recognize the battle that’s been raging inside of him and how it colors the way he interacts with the world, and with Rey.  Thanks to Johnson’s impish sense of humor, the film is littered with jokes — some of the best obviously nod to various fan theories that have sprung up in The Force Awaken’s wake — as well as allusions to other films and a truly wonderful menagerie of fauna ranging far beyond the already-beloved puffin-like porgs, all of which brings warmth and humor to a story that is, at its core, very serious.  But the best details are in the strong bonds that develop between characters, and the way those bonds show who each individual really is. When one character says that the only way to live free is to not join, it’s the film’s encapsulation of what constitutes a bad guy: Star Wars films are testaments to the idea that nobody, not even a Jedi Master, can go it alone without getting destroyed. The Last Jedi is also a deeply political film, though not in the sense that it’s “the film we need right now,” designed to speak to our “current moment” — in a saga as mythic and timeless as Star Wars, that would be a serious mischaracterization. But Star Wars is fundamentally cyclical, a story of generations and history, and the ways that wars can be won in one generation and lost in the next if memory of the past isn’t preserved.  That’s the story in the films, but it’s also the story of the films, with people who grew up watching Star Wars movies now bringing their children to new Star Wars movies. And it’s no spoiler to say that the generational nature of its tale is something The Last Jedi alludes to explicitly several times.  Since the movies are part of our world as much as their own, it’s only natural they’d speak to the big, important ideas that animate political questions of every age. One of the biggest of those is whether power is ultimately a corrupting force, or if it can be wielded for good, and by whom.  In the Star Wars universe, power (often embodied in an ability to control the Force) is indeed a potent corruptor, one that’s hard to walk away from once you’ve gotten a taste. This is what lies behind the stories of the villainous Sith order, but it’s a tension that the heroic Jedi face, too.  In The Last Jedi, the factors determining how power will be wielded and yielded are an awareness of history and — most importantly — a connection to that history through the people around you. It would spoil the story to say much more, but in several key scenes, characters face a choice between following the right path and disconnecting from their pasts and from others. The choice is clear, and the images near the film’s end underline it in moving fashion. That’s nothing new for Star Wars, which has always been a space opera about a family. But this particular iteration drives home that point in a manner that feels, on the tail end of a wearying year, like a deep point of relief, and even joy. Watching lengthy sequences involving heroic, complex characters played by black and Asian and Latinx characters, we can see a future worth living in. Being told that one character was “more interested in protecting the light than she was in seeming like a hero” is a reminder about wielding power well that feels deeply truthful and necessary today. I didn’t grow up with Star Wars, or much pop culture at all. I only saw the films as an adult, and while I’ve always liked them, I never connected to them the way so many people have; whatever it was they were trying to give me never really found its place in my heart. I went to The Last Jedi with high expectations because of the talent behind it, but I was prepared to just have a good time. And I walked out feeling many emotions, but especially something like hope, that elusive thing with feathers (though hope, to be clear, is not a porg).  I felt expectant, and I believed not just that what the movie was saying was true — that even a small band of people with purpose, conviction, and a good, true story to tell can carry on in the face of evil — but that there’s a special power to saying it in a movie.  Star Wars has been with us for four decades now, telling that same essential story in a format that’s overwhelming and engulfing. With wit, skill, and love, The Last Jedi takes up the torch and carries it for a new generation.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," A welcome disturbance in the Force, Rian Johnson’s “The Last Jedi” is, by wide measure, the trippiest, scrappiest and most rule-breaking “Star Wars” adventure yet. Not the exercise in nostalgia that was J.J. Abrams’ “The Force Awakens,” Johnson’s Episode VIII takes George Lucas’ space opera in new, often thrilling, and sometimes erratic directions while finding the truest expression yet of the saga’s underlying ethos of camaraderie in resistance to oppression. Though there are countless familiar broad strokes — rebel escapes, Jedi soul-searching, daddy issues — “The Last Jedi” has discovered some new moves yet, in the galaxy far, far away. As the second installment in this third “Star Wars” trilogy, “The Last Jedi” is like the inverted corollary of “The Empire Strike Back” (long the super fan’s favorite). While it is, like its part-two predecessor, often murky and weird, Johnson’s frequently comic film distinguishes itself by upending the traditional power dynamics of heroes and bit players in the Star Wars galaxy. Here, the odds-defying daredevil flyboy (Oscar Isaac as Resistance pilot Poe Dameron) is an impetuous chauvinist, at odds with a female commander (a purple-haired Laura Dern). “Get your head out of your cockpit,” admonishes Leia (the late Carrie Fisher, to whom the film is dedicated). The master-apprentice relationship — previously Yoda instructing young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) on a swampy remote planet — is now tilted more toward Rey, the young Jedi (Daisy Ridley), sent to stir a monkish Skywalker from a windswept, Porg-infested isle. And instead of a Tauntaun’s guts being spilled, there are even moments of animal rights reflections creeping into the galaxy. About to bite into his rotisserie dinner, Chewbacca, with a sad groan, is struck by pangs of doubt. Abrams’s finest touch in his zippy and nimble reboot was in his diverse casting — in particular Ridley and John Boyega, as Finn, the Stormtrooper turned good guy. But Johnson, who also wrote the film, has gone further to shake up the familiar roles and rhythms of Star Wars. Scattershot and loose-limbed, “The Last Jedi” doesn’t worship at its own altar, often undercutting its own grandiosity. Those breaks of form — formerly mostly reserved for a smirking Harrison Ford — will throw some diehards. Especially in the surreal isolated scenes of Rey and Luke — where Luke, with a thick gray mane and a hermit’s foul-manner is seen drinking a creature’s breast milk and pole-vaulting from rock to rock — “The Last Jedi” teeters on the edge of camp. It’s not surprising that Johnson, the director of the twisty time-traveling noir “Looper,” has made a movie full of clever inversions. What’s jarring is that he’s made a “Star Wars” film that tries to not take itself too seriously, while simultaneously making it more emotional. Yet before its considerable payoff, “The Last Jedi” feels lost and grasping for its purpose. Unlike the earlier films, the less tactile “The Last Jedi” isn’t much for world building, and its sense of place isn’t as firm. As an intergalactic travelogue, it’s a disappointment. There are exceptions, though, especially the chambers of the Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis, adding to his gallery of grotesques). Soaked in an otherworldly crimson red, Snoke’s lair looks like something out of Kubrick’s “Eyes Wide Shut.” Johnson also lacks what Lucas and Abrams alike recognized as the franchise’s most potent weapon: Ford. As the prairie boy turned knight, Hamill has never been the saga’s heart-and-soul. While Luke gets his big moment, “The Last Jedi” doesn’t do him any favors, plopping him on a pitiless jagged rock away from the action and a backstory filled with regret. As Fisher’s final “Star Wars” film, it’s a shame she isn’t more front-and-center. (The next film was to be hers, the way Ford and now Hamill have had theirs.) But she makes her scenes count. Though Isaac has been fashioned as the heir-apparent to the bemused Ford, Boyega is the actor I’ve left both episode VII and VIII wanting more of. The downside in a story that spins its characters around the galaxy is that the new generation of Star Wars protagonists hasn’t had time for the small gestures that would shape their characters — close-ups that their forerunners were afforded. Even after two films, Rey is more of an unstoppable sprite than a fleshed-out person. But “The Last Jedi,” as if with a wind against its back, gathers momentum. By breaking down some of the old mythology, Johnson has staked out new territory. For the first time in a long time, a “Star Wars” film feels forward-moving. Much of that sense of progress comes in the character of Rose Tico (a superlative Kelly Marie Tran), a maintenance worker who’s thrust into a pivotal role in the rebellion. It’s she who voices the film’s abiding message, one that — as the first “Star Wars” film of the Trump era — has affecting resonance. The Resistance will win, she says, “not fighting what we hate” but “saving what we love.” In a pop culture juggernaut as imposing as Star Wars, these moments carry more meaning than they would elsewhere. After long skating around anything political, “The Last Jedi” — whether it’s meant to be or not — has the tenor of a rallying cry. Johnson has fully internalized a single line of dialogue from “The Return of the Jedi” — “You rebel scum,” said with disdain by a Nazi-like lieutenant — and turned it into a badge of pride. “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” a Walt Disney Co. release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for “sequences of sci-fi action and violence.” Running time: 152 minutes. Three stars out of four."
"Dec 12, 2017",NEGATIVE," Light and dark, good and evil. The struggle between these opposing forces has always been at the center of the “Star Wars” universe, and it provides the backbone for the excellent, epic eighth film in the series, “The Last Jedi.” Get your light sabers ready for this one. Writer-director Rian Johnson — he made 2005’s fully committed, wonderfully odd high school noir “Brick” and directed the heart-stopping “Ozymandias” episode of “Breaking Bad” — has crafted a masterful installment of the premier franchise in movies, delivering the biggest, boldest and best “Star Wars” offering since “The Empire Strikes Back.” If 2015’s “The Force Awakens” rebooted the series by cleansing our palates from George Lucas’ dreaded prequels and cranking up the nostalgia machine, “The Last Jedi” gives us a “Star Wars” for today, where the good guys have shades of bad, the bad guys have shades of good and the rich get richer by profiting off the war between the two. “You blow them up today, they’ll blow you up tomorrow,” one character says late in the movie. “It’s just business.” It’s an example of how this “Star Wars” isn’t afraid to stir political debate, while openly questioning who and what decides what makes the good guys good and the bad guys bad. Political leanings aside, “The Last Jedi” is a humdinger, revving up to a monster climax that roars like an orchestra at full power. Johnson stages a visually audacious sequence — perhaps the single greatest-looking set-piece in the “Star Wars” series — set on a desertscape where a white-dusting covers a sea of blood-red sand. Why is it red? Well, mainly because it looks awesome, and Johnson stirs up so much of the red stuff that it’s like watching a samurai movie gone Jedi. “The Last Jedi” also gives us a returning Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, after he was teased in the cliffhanger ending of “The Force Awakens.” Hamill gives a grown, lived-in performance as the bearded, aging Jedi, playing the reluctant teacher to Daisy Ridley’s Rey and the caretaker of the Jedi way of life. Paired with Carrie Fisher’s final performance — the end credits carry a touching dedication to Fisher, who died in late 2016 — “The Last Jedi” honors the “Star Wars” legacy while also letting the new generation shine and grow into their roles. That means the story is carried by Ridley’s Rey, Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren, Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron and John Boyega’s Finn, and their respective screen time is divvied up nicely. There’s also plenty of time for roly poly robot BB-8 and old friends like Chewbacca and C-3PO, while those furry little owl-like creatures known as Porgs dot the landscape of the film but don’t do much other than make cute faces. (Fans worried the Porgs would dominate the screen like Ewoks or a Mr. JJ Binks needn’t get their midichlorians in a bunch.) While “The Last Jedi” explores the push-pull between good and evil, its scorn is reserved for arms dealers and those who profit from war, and there’s one eat-the-rich sequence where the greedy are trampled inside a plush casino. Take that for what you will. Mostly, this “Star Wars” feels relevant, and is spiked with humor, roaring action and fanboy moments that will cause heart palpitations. The worry with the return of the “Star Wars” franchise was that it wouldn’t do enough to alter the landscape or take any risks because there’s too much, financially, at stake for Disney to mess with their cash cow. “The Last Jedi” dispels those notions, and offers up a glowing piece of blockbuster entertainment that delivers to both the “Star Wars” faithful and the non-converted alike. “The Last Jedi” works on several levels, but most importantly it’s a rip-roaring good time. That’s what “Star Wars” fans want the most, and that’s what they get with this dynamite installment. A new hope has arrived, and the Force is strong with this one."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," When Disney decided to take another stab at the Star Wars franchise, trepidation ran high. In the wake of the divisive prequels audiences wanted to see the universe return, but how would it play to a new generation? 2015âs The Force Awakens crafted unique new characters that allowed todayâs children to find themselves in a galaxy far, far away and thatâs a feeling that remains in The Last Jedi. Director Rian Johnson crafts a visually superlative feature with epic aerial battles and high stakes that, in many ways, returns the franchise back to its serialized roots. Some narrative decisions come off as questionable and hokey, but it should finally convince those who havenât let the Force into their heart yet. With the First Orderâs power firmly established they prepare to take the final steps necessary to wipe the Resistance out for good. The Resistance, led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) have gathered the last of the group together but suffer from internal struggles and dissension. Meanwhile Rey (Daisy Ridley) goes on a quest for answers from Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Rian Johnson sets himself apart from previous helmer J.J. Abrams immediately, with an opening aerial battle that combines a lighter tone with serious drama. Domhnall Gleesonâs General Hux takes a cue out of the Peter Cushing playbook with his smarmy villainy thatâs undercut by the cocky jokes of Oscar Isaacâs Poe. Itâd be easy to assume this means the film takes on a more whimsical tone overall, and though there is an uptick in laughter this go-round itâs never at the service of drawing comparisons to Marvel; this isnât Thor: Ragnarok-funny. This is immediately proven by the battle between the First Order and the Resistance. Planes are blown up and mass casualties are detailed with an eye towards treating empathy. A stray shot of a woman using the Force to get a detonator comes off as a patriotic sacrifice that ends up tying into new characters in the grander narrative. Unlike Force Awakens, and even the original trilogy to some extent, thereâs an emphasis on sacrifice and how easy it is to become demoralized by the battering persistence of hate. Gone is the scrappy Resistance fighters who come in to save the day. Instead we see an exhausted crew of individuals desperate for a reprieve but ready to go down fighting. Hope is the filmâs keyword, quoted and attributed to Fisherâs Leia â the entire plotline takes on an extra bit of melancholy considering Fisher is no longer with us. The entire trajectory of The Last Jedi is to remind us to not fight âwhat we hate, [itâs] saving what we love,â a message that certainly plays well in these times. What fuels the film is Reyâs interactions with the newly discovered Luke Skywalker. Comparisons will inevitably be drawn between their scenes and the training of Luke by Yoda in TheÂ Empire Strikes Back. Whatâs unique is here is how the film ends up focusing on Lukeâs growth over the years, feeling like the rise of Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is his fault. One could also say the film wants to explore the cultural significance of the original trilogy itself â a moment involving Leiaâs original message in A New Hope is called a âcheap moveâ â and how Luke, Leia and Han are now the things âthey grow beyond.â Hamill showcases the sadness and resignation of his emotionally drained Luke Skywalker, and at times it overshadows Daisy Ridleyâs own progression as Rey. Ridleyâs performance as Rey is far more confident than the neophyte actress we met in The Force Awakens, but audiences, any issues you had with the character in TFA will be magnified here. Reyâs plot is anchored alongside the growing evil living inside Kylo Ren. Both Ridley and Adam Driver do good work, but itâs hard not to get a fanfiction/high school vibe from how everything plays out. Itâs ultimately the weakest thread in the story. But like Ridley in TFA, the scene stealer of The Last Jedi is another newcomer: Kelly Marie Tran as Rose. Tranâs optimism and enthusiasm makes her the perfect conduit for longtime Star Wars fans. Her initial meeting with Finn sees her gushing over him like a rock star and her blind faith in the Resistance galvanizes their mission to find a codebreaker. Tran and Boyega make a fantastic team, and itâd be enough to see an entire film about their adventures. Their trip to a wealthy planet called Canto Bite continues to further the filmâs social commentary and anchors the audience to Roseâs character, a poor girl who wants to lift people out of their oppressive circumstances. If the narrative with the Resistance is too serious, and Reyâs plot too hokey, Finn and Roseâs storyline is the perfect blend of humor, empathy and advocacy. Star Wars: The Last JediÂ is the perfect antidote to the year that is 2017 and introduces the tonic for what we need to enter 2018: hope. There are some narrative slips, particularly with Rey, but the film is beautiful to look at, the action is intense, and these characters are the right people youâll want to spend time with.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"Sure, The Last Jedi can occasionally be too goofy or free-roaming for its own good, but it's an impossible film to sit in front of and not have a good time."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," “This is not going to go the way you think!” Luke Skywalker warns Rey on the Jedi Temple island of Ahch-To. It sounds like a quote designed for a trailer but now feels like the opening line from Rian Johnson’s pitch. The Last Jedi delivers everything you want from a Star Wars movie — fierce lightsaber action, space dogfights, exotic creatures, people off British telly as bad guys (hello, Ade Edmondson as a First Order Officer) — but layers it with story twists, character arcs and an emotional wallop that you could never have predicted. It doesn’t all work, but it’s a long time since a huge franchise movie has delivered the thrills and feels in such surprising ways. This rug-pulling starts from the get-go. For all those who felt Episode VIII would start with a lightsaber handover (when it happens, that moment is fantastically throwaway), Johnson launches into a breakneck sequence of the Resistance evacuating their base as the First Order attack. Out of the melee, everyone gets more to do. Poe Dameron (Isaac, registering stronger here than in The Force Awakens) is both fly-boy and military leader, butting heads with Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (played by a pink-haired Laura Dern being all Laura Stern); Finn (Boyega, clearly having fun) joins maintenance worker Rose Tico (a likable Kelly Marie Tran) on a mission to disable the First Order’s tracking device that now works through hyperspace; and, on the dark side, Supreme Leader Snoke (Serkis), more formidable in person than in hologram, plays Kylo Ren (Driver) and General Hux (Gleeson) off against each other. Even BB-8 gets bigger action licks rather than cute comedy asides. Still, if Episode VII was Han Solo’s movie, then Episode VIII belongs to Luke. Whether it’s stepping back onto the Millennium Falcon (it’s a hard heart that doesn’t melt when he meets Artoo), or learning to live with regrets, Hamill crafts in a moving performance, perfectly capturing how a gosh-and-golly farm boy can become sarcastic and embittered. A more assured Ridley stands toe-to-toe with him, but is even better in her ‘relationship’ with Ben Solo. Johnson’s conception of their bond is potentially embarrassing: Ridley and Driver not only make it work, they make it gripping. Time and again, Johnson finds a cinematic grammar that feels new to Star Wars; big close-ups (tender touching hands), top shots, elegant camera tracks and pulling out in-world sound, leaving just music and image. In fact, there is a moment involving Leia that is as poetic as the series has ever been. And Johnson isn’t afraid to go trippy, either - a scene in which a character repeatedly clicks their fingers could have come from a ’60s arthouse flick. This is also the first Star Wars film to heavily indulge in flashback as opposed to visions. Be warned: those revelations will prove divisive. But happily, Johnson gets Star Wars, too. His action is thrilling but elegant (there is the most nonchalant lightsaber kill yet). He is not afraid to embrace the cornball, but never goes too cute: the Porgs (not as adorable as you hoped, nor as irritating as you feared) are the butt of the film’s darkest gag. Hell, even the art of comedy ‘Imperial’ officers has returned. But you know he really gets Star Wars in the respect he affords Leia (Fisher, dignified but still with that unmistakable twinkle), or the way he understands the emotional weight of golden dice passed between characters. It doesn’t all work. The middle section loses its shape and is subject to longueurs. Finn and Rose’s mission takes them to Canto Bight, a kind of Monte Carlo peopled by extras from Babylon 5, and feels like it is just ticking the Weird Alien Bar box started by the Cantina. A ride on space horses also feels like a needless diversion, as does Benicio Del Toro’s space rogue, whose strange, laconic presence never really makes its mark. But in its last hour, Johnson serves up bold, gut-wrenching narrative moves you should discover on your own. Throughout, there are beats from * The Empire Strikes Back* playbook — a version of the Dark Side cave, walkers and speeders battling across a glacial plain — but this is not The Dark Middle Act, it’s a multicoloured adventure that juggles different moods and tones. Johnson even bravely channels Return Of The Jedi, to the extent that Episode VIII wraps up leaving Episode IX with almost a clean slate. And that, for an Act II, is no mean feat."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," The Force is definitely awake in The Last Jedi. If anything, it might be over-caffeinated -- rushing from one anecdote to the next with a hyper energy that makes you worried the movie is trying to do too much in too little time. But dang, it's a lot of fun to hang out with. The Last Jedi is funny, it's emotional, it's fast-paced and it has a good story to tell. It might not give you all the answers you want (not yet, anyway), and you might not like every turn it takes, but Star Wars fans will get off the ride happy to have experienced it. It probably won't surprise you that The Last Jedi is the dark middle chapter commonly seen in trilogies. The remaining members of the Resistance aren't just on their heels, they're running away, desperately hoping to survive the First Order onslaught long enough to turn the tide. Some heroes are made along the way. Others are lost. Both Rey (Daisey Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) struggle internally about their place in the galaxy, sharing connection that neither of them understands. At the end of it all you wonder: ""How are our heroes ever going to win this one?"" Because, of course, you need to come back for Star Wars: Episode IX in 2019. Many accused The Force Awakens of being little more than a shameless remake of the original Star Wars movie, A New Hope. Naturally, many also expect The Last Jedi to mirror The Empire Strikes Back. In some ways, it does. As Luke (Mark Hamill) trained with Yoda on the remote planet of Dagobah, Rey trains with Luke on Ahch-To. Or tries to, anyway. The wizened old Jedi is more than a little hesitant to pass on his knowledge of the Force considering his last student turned to the Dark Side and became Kylo Ren. The film acknowledges the ways in which it leans on the past, playing a powerful nostalgia card and having one character remark that it is a ""cheap move."" It's not the only cheap move the movie plays on its audience. The Last Jedi shines, though, when it subverts those expectations of familiarity. Many beats of the story feel like they are knowingly playing chess with the theories fans have been concocting about the movie for the past two years. Nuggets of information seem to confirm popular guesses before they're ripped away. There are moments of genuine surprise, too, and not in the ""I am your father"" sense that you might be looking for. It's a tricky and dangerous game to play with Star Wars fans. How do you stay two steps ahead of viewers that number so many millions, especially when many of them will over-analyze every line of official text you provide them? So far, the stewards of the franchise have proven up to the task, and they once again demonstrate that they are not afraid of shedding beloved elements of the older movies to keep things fresh. The Last Jedi might inject new characters and concepts to a fault. Don't get me wrong, the additions are mostly great. Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), a starry-eyed engineer with a huge heart, is particularly wonderful, but other introductions feel rushed or even wasted. Benicio Del Toro's character, for example, is well-acted yet under-utilized, and it's hard to tell if parts of his story were cut from the film or if he's being introduced purely to set the stage for Episode IX. He shows up late, and while his actions have weight, you're left wondering, ""Is that all he's here for?"" Laura Dern's Vice Admiral Holdo serves a far clearer purpose, but you might still feel as if you're not getting enough out of her presence, impressive though it may be. The Last Jedi clocks in as the longest film in the series' history, and while it doesn't exactly drag, one does wonder if some elements could have been more efficient. Hopefully Lucasfilm is just playing the long game, planting seeds for things that will pay off narratively in the future, rather than existing purely as fodder for cosplayers. I'm glad they didn't cut the Porgs, though. Those little penguin-like creatures are pretty adorable (and they're easy enough to gloss over if you're a heartless monster who hates cute things). Thankfully, we also get plenty of time to spend with friends who were introduced in The Force Awakens. Poe (Oscar Isaac) leaps onto the scene with the same lovable, cocky arrogance we saw when he was first introduced, and he's also given room to grow -- with a lot of help from the always wonderful General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher, to whose memory this film is dedicated). She may have one of the more cheesy moments in The Last Jedi (her moment in space had me rolling my eyes, cool as it looked), but she commands every scene she's in. Finn (John Boyega) is still a bit of a sidekick, but a strong one, learning important lessons about the nature of war (and the people who profit from it) as he strives to be more than just a runaway stormtrooper.  He gets far more screen time than Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) who once again seems to be in the movie far less than was implied pre-release. For as many things that happen in The Last Jedi, much of this film feels like setup for the next. The pieces are moving into position and showdowns seem to be looming on the horizon, but many important questions remain unanswered. Until we get the final piece of this trilogy, though, I know I'll be joining fellow fans in re-watching this one more than a few times. Because Star Wars has that effect on people, especially when it's delivered as well as The Last Jedi is. Britton Peele, Staff Writer.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," The chief complaint against Star Wars: The Force Awakens was that it reveled too much in its own past, repeating the themes and dynamics of the Star Wars franchise too closely. Taking it as an expertly constructed remix, I enjoyed it through and through, but even I will admit that it’s still just a remix.  Star Wars: The Last Jedi, which is now in theaters, won’t ignite the same criticisms. Expectations have been high that, as the second in a trilogy, it will mirror Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. And it certainly does begin with a student looking for a legendary Jedi master, an attack on an evacuating rebel base and a villain on the hunt for Luke Skywalker. But The Last Jedi winds up being its own thing. It concludes with an overwhelming note of hope. It sets its ambitions high and follows through. And it walks the tricky line of surprising a savvy audience while also following its franchise’s familiar symmetries and tropes.  The Last Jedi knows that it is not just trying to make more Star Wars. It’s trying to work with symbols and patterns that Star Wars made forever iconic — conceits that other stories have been building on and reframing and refocusing in every medium for 40 years.  We’ve seen Jedi masters train their students, and we’ve seen countless stories that have built their own training sequences on our cultural familiarity with the tropes of Star Wars. How then, does The Last Jedi use that scaffolding rather than being crushed beneath it, when it has to, once again, show us a Jedi master training his student?  With good ideas, it turns out, and good acting and good writing and good direction and, most of all, good humor. The Last Jedi might be, scene for scene, the Star Wars movie that attempts the most jokes. But it never dispels tension when a scene needs tension or undercuts gravitas when a scene needs gravitas.  Yes, it’s safe to assume this deft tone blending got Rian Johnson the job of helming an entire new Star Wars trilogy. It turns out that Disney really can have a series of war movies that you can take a grade-schooler to. It can even have a war movie that tips its hat to its own setting’s preoccupation with cycles of conflict.  But forget cycles: let’s talk about what’s new. As newcomers to the franchise, Laura Dern navigates a tricky character in Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, while Kelly Marie Tran is instantly lovable as Rose Tico. Benicio del Toro’s character — if he had a name, I never got it, and I’m not even certain he did — is an outright scene-stealer. And, though not new by any means, Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron is given the character arc he was missing in The Force Awakens, when his role was expanded from a first-act death to an implausible third-act reappearance.  Though not created as one, The Last Jedi even works as a worthy send-off for Carrie Fisher. One line in particular, in the full benefit of hindsight, reads as a metaphor for the place that the actress turned author turned irrepressible public speaker of truth found in the hearts of her fans. If this is the last we see of Princess Leia, and it seems like it will be, it will be a good end.  The Last Jedi is not without its disappointments: a stone left unturned here, a contrived conflict there, characters whom I wish had been allowed to share more screen time and others left oddly unexplored (I suppose there will be a tie-in novel about them someday). The Last Jedi is the longest Star wars movie, and it does feel like it. The third act is a beating drum of moments that each seem like they could be a satisfying climax.  But I didn’t care. The Last Jedi had still tricked me into mentally digging my fingers into the armrests, worried that it would do the financially unthinkable: kill off a marketable character.  There are some scenes in this movie I can’t wait to talk about. Not because they’re beautiful, though they are. Not because they’re heart-wrenching, though some of them are. But because The Last Jedi challenges itself with moments that, if mishandled, could easily have tainted beloved Star Wars moments in the same way that many people feel the prequel trilogy did. Instead, it navigates those narrative rapids with aplomb.  And it continues The Force Awakens’ biggest job, that of passing the weight of the galaxy from the shoulders of the original trilogy’s heroes to those of our young protagonists. Here, even more than before, it’s up to them to determine the future of their world.  As in most things, he’s a little overdramatic for the occasion — but it’s still a serviceable metaphor for the journey of the story of Star Wars from the final scene of The Force Awakens to the final scene of The Last Jedi."

When Disney bought the entire Star Wars franchise from Lucasfilm for all the money in the galaxy, the deal forced a reckoning: Over 40 years, George Lucas garnered a massive and rabid fanbase for his singular vision of old-fashioned matinees refashioned for a galaxy far, far away — but it also remained tethered to his whims. (Knock those dopey prequels all you want, but they were the movies Lucas wanted to make.) Millions of fans clamored for satisfaction after the first trilogy, but what they faced was an unwieldy assemblage of Star Wars media in a constant state of identity crisis. There was Jar Jar Binks; there was Hayden Christensen as a young Darth Vader; there were plans to re-release “Attack of the Clones” and “Revenge of the Sith” in 3D. The first post-acquisition movie, J.J. Abrams'” The Force Awakens,” took some stabs at creating a more vital and singular vision, but it achieved that goal largely through unapologetic homage and refashioning the original formula. Now we have Rian Johnson’s “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” — and finally, we can see the future. Under the fastidious guidance of writer-director Johnson, “The Last Jedi” turns the commercial restrictions of this behemoth into a Trojan horse for rapid-fire filmmaking trickery and narrative finesse. The result is the most satisfying entry in this bumpy franchise since “The Empire Strikes Back” in 1980. Johnson’s filmmaking resume makes it easy to argue that he approaches “Star Wars” as an auteur — and in this case, the argument has merit. Johnson’s screenplay plays into fan expectations while upending them with clever structural gimmicks and tonal shifts reminiscent of his previous features “Brick,” “The Brothers Bloom,” and “Looper.” However, by using the language of blockbuster cinema to clarify his ambitions, Johnson outdoes them all. The movie is a manipulative tale of Rebel forces alternately fleeing and confronting their enemies from the First Order, with side trips to wondrous planets, cute animals, and giddy lightsaber battles. It’s also a canny statement on why those things hold appeal: They distract us. And while we’re distracted, Johnson unleashes a fresh bag of tricks. Of course, “The Last Jedi” must also keep the “Star Wars” machine moving forward. “The Force Awakens” ended on an abrupt note, with tough-minded scrapper-turned-Jedi-novice Rey (Daisy Ridley) tracking the reclusive Luke Skywalker (a bearded, leathery Mark Hamill) to the desolate, watery planet of Ahch-To. Johnson will get there, but first offers a flashy space-battle prelude to get the obligatory spectacle out of the way. With the New Order aiming its giant space cannons squarely at the Rebels, ace Rebel pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac, once again sinking his teeth into cocky Han Solo territory) speeds to the massive ship of General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), a cheesy villain with an awful haircut who serves to please Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis as a saurian monstrosity of dubious origins). Hux’s silly bad-guy confidence almost seem like camp, but the movie’s smarter than that. So’s Poe, who promptly begins to troll the villain on the spaceship intercom. It’s an early indication of Johnson’s confidence, injecting the material with humorous self-awareness to leaven the seismic events. Though there’s plenty of discussion about the spiritual prospects of the force, and the philosophical justifications for fighting through dire times, Johnson doesn’t shy from calling out the entertainment value in play (“Permission to jump in an X-wing and blow things up?”), acknowledging that the series’ essence lies as much in the art of spectacle as in its epic world-building. From the astonishing light-and-color show in the opening minutes, the movie never lets up, communing with a cinematic tradition that has its roots in Lucas’ original ambitions in the avant garde. As the Rebels flee the First Order before realizing that they might be trapped in space, the bulk of the movie juts between two scenarios: The Rebels’ quest for survival, under the trenchant guidance of General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher, whose final role is a study in rousing confidence), and Rey’s efforts on Ahch-To to convince the despondent Luke that his old peers need him. It all builds to another face-off, of course, but even the most devout Star Wars fan won’t be able to guess how it gets there.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"The Last Jedi is the best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back, and is awful close to being its equal."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Star Wars: The Last Jedi  L to R: Rey (Daisy Ridley as Rey and Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker in a still image from LucasFilm's ""Star Wars: A Last Jedi."" All “Star Wars” movies end up being remembered, and this one is going to be remembered for Mark Hamill. Here’s an actor who has spent a long time living with Luke Skywalker, being the guy who was in those movies, getting older, getting used to it, rebelling against it, carving out a place inside his head where he can have his own identity. And all of those 40 years of coming to terms with being Luke find their way into this performance. The movie begins maybe five or 10 minutes after “The Force Awakens” ended. Rey (Daisy Ridley) has found Luke on a remote rock of a planet, where he has lived like a hermit for long time. The last movie ended with the suggestion that Luke is the heavy artillery, the Jedi master who is about to get into the fight. But “The Last Jedi” immediately takes a different direction. Luke isn’t interested. He wants no part of any star wars. He may have seemed like a contemplative philosopher at the end of the last episode, but don’t let the gray whiskers fool you. He’s a bitter guy, who looks like Rutherford B. Hayes on a three-day drunk, and he’s filled with self-loathing, cynicism and regret. He looks like what 40 years can do to a person, and the gung-ho kid of yore is nowhere to be found on that face. Hamill is completely without compromise here. There’s no twinkle peeking out from between the stern words. There are no new lessons for the veteran to learn, because he has already learned them all, and they have led him to this miserable, solitary existence. What a brilliant turn by writer-director Rian Johnson to land Luke Skywalker in such a way, and what a committed piece of acting by Hamill, who gives this everything he has. As for the rest of the movie, it’s pretty good, not quite in the same league as “The Force Awakens,” but an improvement over “Rogue One.” It has the feel and atmosphere of a “Star Wars” movie and gets pulses going with a strong opening sequence, in which Poe (Oscar Isaac), who always needs a shave, leads a ragtag group of fighters against a fleet of elite starships. The Resistance faces steep odds throughout “The Last Jedi.” Basically, they’re losing the whole time. Still, they have one big advantage over the evil empire, and that comes under the category of faulty construction. Apparently every single device, ship or Death Star created by the Empire operates in a way that, if you just happen to hit one vulnerable spot, the entire thing blows up. Their engineers have just never quite figured a way around that. The Empire’s Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) is a large, cadaverous entity with an evil English accent and a long scar on his head that looks like he tried scalp reduction surgery and it just didn’t take. His lieutenant is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who is just back from killing his own father, Han Solo. Ren doesn’t feel all that great about what he did. He thinks he probably did the right thing, but he’s just not sure. In a series of telepathic communications, Rey senses the good within him, even if the audience has no idea what she’s seeing. “The Last Jedi” has lots of moving parts, but the action mainly surrounds a couple of ambivalent men, Ren and Luke, and a couple of determined women, Rey and Gen. Leia, who are trying to save the galaxy. It’s good to see Carrie Fisher again, alive through the magic of film. She looks a bit frail, a bit worn down, but then one of the running themes of “The Last Jedi” is the toll that endless conflict takes on the survivors, who live with the awful knowledge that victories are never final. Fisher is the soul of this series, and it’s hard to imagine who could ever take her place. The skillful plotting of “The Last Jedi” means there are lots of surprises, big and small. Whenever you think you know how things will play out, the movie pulls a reversal. Characters take turns being right and being wrong. Nobody knows everything. Johnson is likewise very smart in knowing when to play up the traditional “Star Wars” elements and when to spoof them. For example, Domhnall Gleeson plays a starched Empire general, and just when you’re sure the movie is descending into accidental parody, Johnson reveals the character as intentionally ludicrous. As is often the case with “Star Wars,” a certain battle fatigue begins to set in after two hours, but Johnson possesses an instinct for when he has gone over his limit, and he varies or scales back on the space battles each time he needs to. In any case, it helps that Fisher, Hamill and to an extent Ridley ground the action in deeply wrought emotion. You don’t see many sci-fi action extravaganzas that are about late-middle-aged disappointment, about wondering what it’s all about and whether any of it was worth it. It’s this element that gives “The Last Jedi” an extra something, a fascinating melancholy undercurrent.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," At the core of all the Star Wars films is the battle between good and evil: the light against the dark, the Jedi against the Sith, the Rebel Alliance versus the Empire. But above all, it is about equilibrium, about bringing balance to the force. And a balancing act is precisely what Rian Johnson, the director of The Last Jedi, has on his hands. He, like JJ Abrams before him with The Force Awakens, has to imbue his film with enough of the franchise's dense mythology to please its dedicated legion of fans, but also drive the narrative forward and put his stamp on the space saga. Fan theories have swarmed around Johnson’s project, for which he has the only writing credit. In the last year, a lot of digital ink has been spilled on news sites asking such questions as: Who are Rey (Daisy Ridley)’s parents? Who is Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis)? Who are the Knights of Ren? Well, it seems Johnson isn’t interested in fan theories. Instead, he has concentrated on giving audiences a nuanced, touching, humorous adventure, laced with thrilling derring-do space battles and some jaw-dropping visuals. The narrative has been balanced wonderfully; Johnson offers up squeal-inducing references to the past, but isn't so beholden to the previous movies that he isn’t willing to poke a little fun at fans. The Star Wars universe is much-loved, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have flaws in past installments, and Johnson sets about correcting as many as he can while never losing sight of telling a good yarn. The director, heretofore best known for his highschool noir pastiche Brick, takes every opportunity to haul us deeper into Star Wars’ universe in every sense. We dive into the guts of an X-Wing to see the tools of war in action as adorable robot BB-8 whizzes and beeps while fixing fried motherboards. Then we see what happens when it goes wrong, when pilots die – not with a Wilhelm scream, but with a lingering shot on the ill-fated soldier’s final moments, giving us a rare insight into the consequence of war and rebellion, more in tone with the final scenes of Gareth Edward’s spectacular Rogue One. The Last Jedi may be dealing with the sins of the fathers, but it is the mothers, daughters and sisters who are there to pick up the pieces and guide the galaxy to peace; more than any other Star Wars film, Johnson puts women at the centre. There is the battle-hardened but world-weary Leia (Carrie Fisher in a touching final performance, to whom the film is dedicated); the eager Jedi-in-waiting Rey, and two new characters. The first is Rose, played by newcomer Kelly Marie Tran, who steals the film as a tenacious Rebel engineer. Then there’s Laura Dern, who with soft-flowing purple hair and a steely gaze sits by General Leia’s side leading the Resistance as Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo. Then there are the men. As we know from The Force Awakens, Luke (Mark Hamill) has gone into hiding, and without giving anything away, he is still reeling from the betrayal of his best-pupil and nephew Kylo-Ren (Adam Driver). Hamill delivers the goods, with a performance laced with a wry sense of humour offering up salty lines like, “You think I’m gonna walk out with a laser sword and take on the First Order?” Ren is as much a rage-fuelled adolescent as ever, taken down a peg or two by Snoke, who witheringly describes him as a child in a mask. In the final moments you might feel a twang of disappointment: not with The Last Jedi itself, but the fact that Johnson isn’t directing Episode IX, as he has proven himself more than worthy of leading this saga by crafting a film with a great sense of heart, humour and heroism."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," When last we saw her — in J.J. Abrams' franchise reboot The Force Awakens — she was seeking reclusive Jedi Luke Skywalker on his planet of lonely exile. She was hoping to recruit him to join the rebel alliance to counter the evil First Order forces of Emperor Snoke and his dark-side-of-the-force apprentice Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), a guy with Jedi potential and dark-side predilections. It's a version of the open question that drives all Star Wars movies. Kylo may have some good in him, and Rey may have some bad in her. They both know it, and it forms the basis of the Junior Jedi Psychic Hotline that is the most interesting narrative device in Rian Johnson's competent next entry in the Star Wars saga. No matter what's going on in the various battles that form the plot, Kylo and Rey can at any moment see through time and space and try to draw the other to his/her side. First Order cruisers in relentless pursuit of rebel ships carrying Leia (the late, great Carrie Fisher) and the last of the beleaguered rebel alliance. Johnson makes these scenes his own with visual references to World War II carrier battles (fighters, bombers, dreadnoughts) and it's an interesting choice, even if the falling bombs seem to suggest that gravity exists in outer space. Other references go all the way back to 18th century naval engagements — projectiles cut through space and explode at the end of their range with a muffled thump (technical aspects of the movie are first rate, as usual). The rebel fleet may be doomed unless Finn (John Boyega) and fellow rebel Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) find a computer hacker (Benicio Del Toro) capable of breaking into the imperial command ship's firewall. The details of this mission are less important than the friendship that develops between Finn and Rose. It's in keeping with the larger purpose of The Last Jedi, which is to make diversity both a franchise goal and an important story theme. The rebel alliance (also known as the Resistance) is a rainbow coalition, and Star Wars — and here my personal bias may be showing — is now as diverse as Star Trek was 50 years ago. Here, though, women get to run things. Leia — whose trusted lieutenant is played by Laura Dern — is in charge of the rebels, and the future of all that good rests in the spunky heart of Rey, who has made contact with Luke, and is trying to grasp the riddle of his exile and his disenchantment with the Jedi religion. These scenes benefit from the fact that Hamill has become a more seasoned performer over the years, able to project the gravitas required of his character. Rey needs all the help she can get — all signs point toward a showdown with Kylo and Snoke, just as the battle between imperial forces and the rebel forces reach its decisive moment. Rey is strong, perhaps as strong as Kylo, but she is impetuous, and even with the best of intentions and the force on her side, we know the treachery and power of dark-side wizardry. There is always the possibility that Snoke gets in her eyes. Perhaps that's why they are watering so much. Hamill, Driver, Ridley — their lids brim with tears in half the movie, which wavers between operatic seriousness and wisecracks. Some of these are funny, but for people who lived a long time ago in a galaxy far away, they sure use a lot of anachronistic earth slang (After an explosion: ""That ship is toast!""). Aside from that, the Johnson and Abrams movies live dutifully in the universe of the original George Lucas trilogy — after the Phantom Menace trilogy debacle, it's what fans claim they wanted. But there is the risk of diminishing returns. These sequels trade directly on the emotional legacy of the originals (The Last Jedi makes some leaps into sentimental hyperspace, particularly in the way that it handles Fisher on-screen), and the more of the aged Luke and Leia we see, the more we chip away at the mythic power of characters as Lucas left them: Young, strong, immortal."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Dir: Rian Johnson; Cast: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Laura Dern, Benicio Del Toro, Domnhall Gleeson, Lupita Nyong'o, Gwendoline Christie, Kelly Marie Tran, Anthony Daniels; 12A cert, 152 mins. “We are what they grow beyond,” one old-timer observes to another in Star Wars: The Last Jedi (12A cert, 152 mins) as they watch a symbol of their shared past go up in smoke. The twosome – one of whom is a weary and grizzled Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) – are reflecting on the new generation of rebels fighting their age-old cause in ways they could have never expected. Watching the torch being carried forward is “the true burden of all masters”, Luke’s companion continues – and if George Lucas was ever to watch the latest entry in the cinema-changing series he created, the line might strike a plaintive chord.  Writer-director Rian Johnson’s film certainly feels like Star Wars: it even has a supporting cast made up of British character actors and gorgeously CG-augmented rubber creatures, including porgs, a kind of hyper-marketable cross between a puffin and a young Justin Bieber. But it’s not a Star Wars you’re entirely sure Lucas would or could have ever made himself. Rather than playing the hits, as JJ Abrams’s franchise-reviving The Force Awakens did two Christmases ago, it flexes its fingers before riffing over old chord progressions in ways that will leave fans beaming with surprise.  Johnson, the director of the winding neo-noirs Looper and Brick, doesn’t share Abrams’s heart-on-sleeve delight in homage and pastiche – and Star Wars’s biggest open secret is that it has always been homage and pastiche, even the original ones. The way this film uses Luke is entirely different to Abrams’s nostalgic deployment of Harrison Ford’s Han Solo in The Force Awakens, for instance: while it’s an unbridled joy to see Hamill return to his defining role, the character is now a surly hermit, scarred by secrets.  But Johnson does seem to share Abrams’s view of that famous galaxy far, far away as a vast and marvellous mechanism, whose movements are so ingenious that it’s enormous fun just watching its parts tick intricately from one configuration to the next.  In doing so, The Last Jedi mounts some genuinely startling narrative twists and feints, while charting an onward course for the franchise that has you itching to discover what comes next. That’s smart business practice, but it’s also exemplary blockbuster filmmaking. After a rocky two years at Lucasfilm, packed with directorial firings that suggested a lack of certainty of purpose at the studio, the new Star Wars film would inevitably be judged both in terms of its blunt-force entertainment value and how well it bodes for the franchise’s long-term health. Johnson’s film earns full marks on both counts. How much of the premise to share without risking death threats? It feels safe enough to say that things pick up almost exactly where The Force Awakens ended, and the film assumes you’re already revving your engine at the starting line, and will have no problem keeping up. The brave orphan Rey (Daisy Ridley) has tracked Luke to his island hideaway, lightsaber in hand, with questions about his fallen apprentice Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and her own mysterious past. The half-monstrous, half-elegant, all-scary Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) is still bent on wiping out General Leia (a suitably stately final turn from Carrie Fisher) and her dogged Resistance, whose numbers have never been at a more precarious ebb. That’s largely thanks to Snoke’s fascistic First Order, led by the merciless General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), who issues orders like “obliterate the fleet” with the look of a man who’s just found a rancid haddock in his pillow case. Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), Leia’s steely and silvery-purple-haired deputy, has a cloak-and-dagger plan to turn the tide of struggle. But ace pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) covertly launches a flashier counter-initiative, dispatching ex-stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) and a plucky and principled security guard called Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) to the casino resort of Canto Bight – think the Mos Eisley cantina crossed with the French Riviera of To Catch a Thief – where lurks a sneak-thief who can slip a raiding party on board the First Order’s flagship. Johnson’s screenplay staves off pomp by undercutting itself at every opportunity, joking about laser swords and levitating rocks, while the familiar Force cosmology – the eternal struggle between dark and light – is coaxed in some unexpected directions. During Rey's Jedi boot camp, Luke describes the Force as a kind of potential energy created by oppositions in nature: bad news for midi-chlorians, but good news for the plot, which is built around those kind of elemental clashes.  From Rey versus Kylo Ren to Luke versus the First Order to Laura Dern versus a Star Destroyer –  that’s one you’ll want to see on the big screen – these confrontations aren’t just thrilling and beautifully staged, but have an eeriness and loneliness that reminded me of Ralph McQuarrie’s unearthly Star Wars concept art from 1975. Lucas was able to use and develop much of what McQuarrie envisioned, but there was little space for those minor-key qualities amid the bustle of the first three films. The Last Jedi leans into them. It’s less Star Wars as you’ve never seen it than Star Wars as you’ve never felt it."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Here’s the shameful truth I’ve been carrying with me for all my years as a Star Wars fan: I just don’t like The Empire Strikes Back as much as I’m supposed to. Sure, its stunning opening battle—relentless AT-ATs looming on the snowy horizon—is an all-time highlight of the franchise. But after that, we have to spend so much time with Luke in the swamp with Yoda, talking about the Force and all his hang-ups about his destiny, his place in the world. It’s all a bit of a snooze for me. I’ve just never liked the mystical aspects of Star Wars as much as I’ve dug the rollicking rebellion, the space opera of it all. Inasmuch as 2015’s new trilogy opener, The Force Awakens, modeled itself (heavily) on the original Star Wars film, the second installment, The Last Jedi, is the Empire of the current batch. It opens with another assault on Rebel forces, writer-director Rian Johnson beginning in medias res and setting a tone both witty and serious, exploring the familiar physics of the Star Wars galaxy and figuring out what new things can be done with them. (He keeps doing this throughout; it’s ingenious.) The opening is terrific—suspenseful and sad and brilliantly staged. But then, of course, it’s time to get all spiritual with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill, in fine grizzled form) and budding young Jedi Rey (Daisy Ridley, magnetic), a possibility that filled me with that familiar Empire Strikes Back unease—the sense that I’m meant to be into all this metaphysical stuff, while really wanting to just get back to the blaster fights. To my surprise, that moment never really arrived as The Last Jedi laid out its long and intricate plot. There are moments in Rey’s journey toward enlightenment that are genuinely thrilling, from the sweeping shots of the rocky seabound island where she does her training to her intense mind-meld conversations with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver, deepening and clarifying his conflicted villain), which come laden with a troubling, intriguing chemistry. The Force is, to me, still silly Star Wars mumbo jumbo, but Johnson finds a way to underscore it with humanity, with a classical Greek rumble of true pathos. On that front, The Last Jedi is a pure success, accessing the molten core of its drama and grappling with it in nuanced ways. Johnson expands the psychology of Star Wars, bringing shading and moral ambivalence to this mythic tale of dark versus light. No Star Wars has ever made a better case for the Force than this film, which finally mends the damage done by the midi-chlorian humbug introduced in the disastrous prequel films. One could make the corny assessment that Johnson himself has tapped into this elemental magic, has learned how to tease out its true power, the ways it can manipulate and enrich the film without drowning it in pseudo-religious pretension. That’s no easy feat, and for achieving it, The Last Jedi will connect with many a die-hard and newbie alike, I suspect. The narrative involving Luke, Rey, and Kylo is so big and consequential that the film’s other plots—involving Oscar Isaac’s hotshot pilot Poe Dameron, John Boyega’s former stormtrooper Finn, and new characters played by Laura Dern and Kelly Marie Tran—sometimes struggle to hold their own. I’ve no doubt that Johnson understands a crucial Star Wars balance—the calibration between goofy creature gags, starship melees, and high-minded fantasy. But that doesn’t always mean he gets it right. Or maybe he’s just made one section of the story so good that all others feel that much less weighty in comparison. With last year’s Rogue One and now this film, Lucasfilm—meaning Disney—has admirably followed through on its initiative to introduce more diversity into the main casts of its films. That Boyega and Tran, who plays a Rebel tech named Rose, get an adventure together is exciting. Seeing a black man and an Asian woman put toward the center of a huge franchise film like this is encouraging—because representation matters, yes, and because it gives a more thorough sense of what a rebellion like this might look like. It’s wholly more inspiring to see an array of different faces (and bodies, and species) banding together to fight oppression. That’s how it should be. It’s a shame, then, that the righteousness of Finn and Rose’s place in the film is undermined slightly by the limpness of their mission. Perhaps feeling there had to be some kind of Mos Eisley–esque sequence in the film, Johnson sends the pair to a casino city full of all kinds of creatures. It’s fun, sure, but the whole operation ultimately turns out to be a red herring. At least there’s some nice musing on liberation during this stretch, reminding us of the real stakes of this long story—freedom is, after all, what the Empire denies and the Rebel Alliance promises. And in a gorgeous third-act sequence—which includes the film’s true Empire Strikes Back homage—Finn and Rose finally get the emboldened moments they deserve. I just wish they fit more integrally into the central thesis of the film, that they were just as special, in their way, as Rey is, glinting with messianic power as she ascends. That’s not really how Star Wars movies are built, though, is it? The ordained ones do their desert walks and garden praying, while everyone else—scrappy, winning—scrambles below. I normally prefer the scrambling. But The Last Jedi flipped that equation for me, which is maybe what an inversion or a reflection of an older film should do. The Last Jedi feels less slavish than The Force Awakens did. It challenges the structure it’s intended to imitate, expanding here and contracting there to make a differently shaped film that nonetheless has the evocative, comforting hum of the familiar. And it’s full of small pleasures. There are two moments of sacrifice in the film—both involving tenacious women, I’ll add—that are downright beautiful, fiery and tragic and stirring. They bring to mind the moving denouement of Rogue One, which gravely illustrated how many of the heroes in the fight against despotism are the ones who won’t live to enjoy the world they’re struggling to create. I’m also in love with two of the film’s new species. There are, of course, the heavily touted Porgs, chirruping little chipmunk/puffin things that are adorable and amusing and employed with just the right amount of restraint. But there are also these fish creatures, nun stewards of Luke’s island—wimples and all—that are, in their weird way, perhaps the film’s most clever invention. They’re rendered with such character and care, giving off the humble, dignified bluster of life carrying on—of principle and tradition surviving—amidst the rot and ruin of war. They’re also just really funny. The whole movie is funny, from Domhnall Gleeson’s nerd-rage General Hux to Oscar Isaac’s suave delivery to good ol’ BB-8, given nearly as much agency as the human characters in this one. It’s hard watching Carrie Fisher in the film, knowing that she’s gone now; it’s also a joy. She gives a spirited final performance, flinty as ever, getting a particularly great one-liner toward the end that’s perhaps more in character with Carrie than it is with Leia—but who the hell cares. She more than earned it. I suppose I should end this review with allusions to Trump and the energizing, inspiring sight of people going to battle against cold and consuming fascism, because that’s where so many movies lead us these days. And all that rousing spirit is in The Last Jedi, in ways accidental and, probably, deliberate. But rather than let those real-life ghouls once again suck up all the air in the room, I’ll instead close on a more positive note: after all the tumult and horror of this year, here at the bitter end of it, we get to see Laura Dern do something really cool in a huge space movie, creating perhaps one of the most indelible Star Wars images of all time in the process. For whatever issues I may have with this ever-so-slightly lopsided movie, that alone is enough to make The Last Jedi a classic."
"Dec 12, 2017",NEGATIVE," 1. The Last Jedi, unlike its predecessor, has the freedom to be daring, and perhaps the most thrilling thing about it—and there are many, many thrilling things—is how abundantly it takes advantage of that freedom. If The Force Awakens was basically just Star Wars told again in a new, but familiar way, The Last Jedi challenges the audience, challenges the Star Wars mythos, even challenges the whole damned series itself. It blows the universe up to rebuild it; it is a continuation and a new beginning. And more than anything else, it goes places no Star Wars film has ever dreamed of going. The movie is smart, stirring and deeply exciting, but more than anything, it is surprising. This is a Star Wars movie that plays with your assumptions and upends them, but it never betrays the story, characters and ethos at the series’ core. It expands the idea of what a Star Wars movie can be. It’ll knock you over. 2. The movie opens with a breathtaking battle scene that quietly introduces all the themes the rest of the film will be interested in, notions of heroism, sacrifice and the intrinsic value of both, and neither. We see our old friend Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac, magnetic as ever) sweeping in and out of a Starfighter battle with the First Order, and we cheer him on: Poe’s gonna save the day because that’s what Poe does, because that’s what always happens in Star Wars movies. But the movie has a lot more on its mind than that. We learn quickly that Poe’s dashing loner act actually costs lives – Leia demotes him immediately and even slaps him across the face—and the tone is set. Instantly we’re plunged into a story that is less about the good guys beating the bad guys and more about understanding what it means, exactly, to be good. This is a Star Wars story with moral complexity at every turn, a truly audacious decision from writer-director Rian Johnson that essentially turns the series inside out. It’s a film that makes us reexamine the morals and motivations of everyone onscreen, and of the entire series itself. It pushes us to make our own choices, to know what we’ve been cheering for this whole time. It is not simply Light vs. Dark, not in Johnson’s Star Wars universe. “There are no good guys or bad guys,” one character says. “There is just the machine.” The Last Jedi doesn’t believe that. But it makes us look closely enough at everything so that we can understand why. 3. Thus, when Rey (Daisy Ridley) heads off to meet Luke (Mark Hamill, giving a performance one suspects he himself didn’t quite consider him capable of), it is not simply a training session to go beat Kylo Ren and the Force Order. Luke spends his time trying to dissuade Rey from becoming a Jedi, or even the idea of being a Jedi in the first place; we learn more of Luke’s unknown weaknesses and strengths, including some he didn’t even understand himself. Finn runs off on a quest with a maintenance worker named Rose (Kelly Marie Tran, an actress of great empathy and warmth) that turns out to be more trouble than it’s worth until, suddenly, it isn’t. And Poe himself must learn, through clashes with both Leia and a new commander (Laura Dern) who has no patience with his grandstanding, that this new world is one where he must find his place in ways he never understood before. And even Kylo Ren, played by Adam Driver, a truly great actor finding poetry in Ren’s rage and confusion, must face who he is, what made him that way and how he can change the mistakes of the past … if he even wants to. The movie is chock-full of moments that put these characters, the new ones and the old ones, up for scrutiny: To truly look at what they believe, and the difference between evil and good, between black and white, between hope and fear. What’s remarkable is how it this complexity doesn’t darken our characters and the series we’ve loved for 40 years: It sharpens them. It makes them sing in a way they haven’t before. 4. This is a lot of discussion so far about things that don’t feature spaceships and lightsabers, so it warrants mentioning that the movie mostly delivers your Star Wars goods, too. The movie is bookended by truly astonishing battle sequences, scenes that harken back to scenes we’ve seen before but keep upending our expectations. Johnson makes sure to keep you on your toes but doesn’t forget to knock you off them. (We also have a few old friends popping up that you might not have expected.) There are moments in the middle that can sometime drag a bit with exposition; the movie has a lot of masters to serve, running about 20 minutes longer than The Force Awakens. Of the three simultaneous plots, it’s Finn’s that sometimes drags down the energy, particularly with an introduction of a shady thief played by Benicio del Toro, the only new addition to the cast that doesn’t quite work; he seems to be acting in his own private movie, and it’s not as good as this one. But even that plotline ties up with a moment of impressive power. (And features an interlude that’s almost certainly the most political statement the series has ever made.) The movie never takes its eye off the ball. It is precisely, and strictly, focused. 5. In a way, the success J.J. Abrams had with The Force Awakens, particularly how decidedly fan-servicey it was, laid the groundwork for what The Last Jedi is able to pull off. That movie reminded you how much power and primal force this series still had. This movie is an even more impressive magic trick: It uses that power and force to connect you to something larger, to tear the whole series down so that it can be rebuilt again. Not everything in The Last Jedi works perfectly, but even its few missteps are all founded in the desire for something new, to take risks, to push an American myth into uncomfortable new directions. It ends up coming through stronger. The Last Jedi is sturdy, formidable, thick with ideas and uncompromising in their execution. And it ends on a note of grace and, yeah, hope, with what might be the best closing shot the series has ever seen. The Last Jedi wraps its way around your heart through your brain: It burns down the past and opens up the future in unprecedented ways. It’s a damned near miracle."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Rian Johnson’s sequel, despite numerous callbacks to the original trilogy, feels like it’s moving the franchise forward through thoughtful themes, powerful visuals, and rich storytelling.  Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a film that needed to play it safe in some regards. It was introducing new characters, new worlds, and trying to restore a fanbase that felt burned by the prequels. It succeeded in establishing a baseline for the sequel trilogy, and that baseline has allowed writer-director Rian Johnson to move the franchise forward with the stunning Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Although, like The Force Awakens, it takes more than a few beats from the Original Trilogy, Johnson feels eager to subvert our expectations, challenge the archetypes the series was founded on, and take bold steps to establishing a new concept of what a Star Wars movie can be while still feeling very much in line with previous films in the franchise. Although the movie suffers from a few pacing issues, they ultimately don’t detract from the film’s stunning craft and confident storytelling.   The Last Jedi is spread out over three storylines. Although Starkiller Base was destroyed, the First Order is on the move and the Resistance is on the ropes. Rey (Daisy Ridley) has traveled to the island on Ahch-To to try and convince Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to join the Resistance and lead a new Jedi Order, but she also has the personal motives to try and find her place in the galaxy now that the Force has awakened within her. She’s also found a new bond with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) that allows them to communicate over long distances, and she believes she might be able to save him like Luke saved Vader. Over on the Resistance Fleet, Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) butts heads with commanding officer Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) over trying to preserve the remnants of the fleet with the First Order bearing down on them. Discovering they can’t escape because their lightspeed is being tracked by the First Order, a revived Finn (John Boyega) and technician Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) head to the casino on Canto Bight to find a hacker who can break the tracking device and allow the Resistance to escape.   Although the similarities to The Empire Strikes Back are clear, Johnson is always upping the stakes in his story to try and deprive the audience of the security blanket of recognizing callbacks and parallels. The opening battle between the Resistance and the First Order makes the skirmish on Hoth look like a cakewalk, and Johnson is invested in not only showing the cost of war (as much as a PG-13 movie will allow), but challenging the comfortable archetypes that allows viewers to take a passive stance on the conflict at hand. In a lesser movie, the cocksure Poe Dameron challenges authority, shows his bold ways are what wins battles, and is the Han Solo 2.0 that inspires a generation of boys to also be cocksure charmers. In The Last Jedi, Johnson is eager to challenge that ideal and show that it’s wise, authoritative women like Holdo and Leia (Carrie Fisher) that have something to teach the flyboys. That’s incredibly refreshing, but it never feels preachy or self-congratulatory. It comes off as the evolution this story needs.   You see that evolution on Ahch-To as well where, on the surface, it seems like The Last Jedi has created a mash up of Empire and Return of the Jedi where the island is Rey’s Dagobah, providing a journey of self-discovery and Jedi training, but she also believes she can save Kylo Ren by forming a personal bond with him. Neither one goes according to plan, and while the parallels are clear, where The Last Jedi comes alive is how Johnson twists and subverts our expectations in the way that only a true Star Wars fan can. If The Force Awakens was a matter of giving fans what they wanted, then The Last Jedi is giving them what they need, which is more complex characters and themes that break free of the traditional archetypes and mythic tropes the franchise was founded upon.   Where the film struggles the most is on Canto Bight. Taken on her own, Rose isn’t a bad addition to the Star Wars mythos, and the movie definitely needs someone to play against Finn. Unfortunately, they lack the electric chemistry we saw between Finn and Rey in The Force Awakens, and their secret mission in a casino feels like it should be far more entertaining than it actually is. The plot beats feel rote, but that can almost be forgiven for Johnson’s willingness to go overtly political. Johnson shows the rich populace of Canto Bight as war profiteers, free from the consequences of their actions, burdened by neither the First Order or the Resistance or even the morality of the child slavery that supports their entertainment.   Some may see this kind of commentary as a break from the escapism they expect from a Star Wars film, but it’s actually Johnson making the world richer and more complex, finally freeing it from its sacred confines, pulling it apart to see what makes it tick, and building it back into something richer and more interesting if not as easy to digest. Rather than follow a clear moral line, it pulls the characters into interesting trajectories, showing their faults and pushing deeper into the greys rather than relishing the black-and-white conflict that spawned the series.   And yet none of these complexities deprive the film of its richness or texture. This is still Star Wars, but with the freedom to finally take some chances in everything it does from the humor (this is the first Star Wars movie to make a joke at the expense of someone’s mother), to the visuals (cinematographer Steve Yedlin has made the best-looking Star Wars movie with images that others will copy for years to come), to the score (John Williams continues to find ways to outdo himself) and beyond. The performances across the board are outstanding with everyone absolutely owning their character. Snoke finally feels threatening, Luke is broken but not unrecognizable, and Fisher makes us miss her terribly every second she’s on screen. The Last Jedi is a movie that feels different enough that it no longer feels stale, but it never veers so far away that you couldn’t immediately recognize it as Star Wars.   Where the film falters is in its pacing. Even jumping between three storylines, there’s a lack of momentum at times as no one is really going anywhere. The Resistance fleet is crawling away from the First Order; Rey is in a stalemate with Luke on Ahch-To; and obviously things aren’t a breeze on Canto Bight. And yet the dramatic tension of the first two storylines hold up intact. The fleet storyline plays like the excellent Battlestar Galactica episode “33” and everything is Ahch-To is great because Johnson is doing some fascinating things with the character dynamics between Rey, Luke, and Kylo Ren. But the Canto Bight stuff is a bit of a drag, and then you feel it in final act of the film where, despite some amazing moments, you can’t shake the feeling that The Last Jedi is probably a bit too long even if it’s difficult to know what to cut.   Even if you can feel the film’s runtime as it heads to the climax, there’s no shortage of appreciation for what Johnson has accomplished. I won’t be surprised if fans start openly wondering if The Last Jedi is better than A New Hope or Empire, although I think it’s clear that the film surpasses The Force Awakens even if the sequel’s success is partly due to the unglamorous groundwork The Force Awakens had to accomplish. There are so many moments and details I want to dig into with The Last Jedi, but I don’t want to spoil the many reveals, twists, and turns that make the movie such a wonderful experience. I lost count of the jaw-dropping moments The Last Jedi presents, and it’s a movie I can’t wait to revisit.  Matt Goldberg has been an editor with Collider since 2007.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," With one foot planted in the Skywalker family saga and the other striding toward bold new territory, writer-director Rian Johnson delivers plenty of excitement, humor and soaring moments in “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” a rousing middle-of-a-trilogy installment of the franchise. Starkiller Base, destroyed at the end of “The Force Awakens,” is still a smoldering cinder when Johnson’s story kicks off, but the evil First Order is as determined as ever to wipe out the “rebel scum” of the Resistance. There’s infighting among the rebels, though, as hotshot pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) leads a daring mission against the orders of his commander, General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher, getting the last word a year after her death). In the aftermath of the early skirmish, the Resistance fleet is barely holding on against a barrage ordered by the First Order’s General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) at the behest of Supreme Leader Snoke (performed by Andy Serkis). It’s up to Finn (John Boyega), the ex-stormtrooper and Poe’s friend, and a new character, plucky crew member Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), to devise a plan to cut through the defenses of Snoke’s flagship. But what of Rey (Daisy Ridley), the desert scrounger whose budding gifts in the ways of the Force dominated the last movie? She’s where we left her, trying to persuade a grizzled Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to end his self-imposed exile and help the Resistance. But Luke, who believes “the time of the Jedi must end,” sees Rey has deeper questions about her destiny and her connection to his nephew and former student, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who now sits at Snoke’s right hand. Johnson (“Looper”) deftly weaves the plot threads together, mixing deadpan humor, familiar characters — like the stalwart Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo, filling the furry boots of Peter Mayhew) and the chrome-plated Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) — and some surprising new ones, led by Laura Dern’s Vice Admiral Holdo. About the only weak spot is Benicio Del Toro, playing a shadowy rogue and feeling weirdly out of place among the space-opera heroics. Johnson stages some of the most dynamic action sequences ever seen in a “Star Wars” movie and sets them to a ticking-clock narrative that heightens the tension. The brisk pace and nonstop action make the 2 1/2-hour running time (the longest in the series) move like a landspeeder at full throttle. And yet, Johnson proves that he can deliver emotional resonance beyond the whiz-bang spectacle. He gives ample room to explore Rey’s quest to understand the Force, Kylo’s pursuit of power, and Luke’s need to balance the dark and the light. What’s more, he shows how the power of hope, embodied in Leia’s no-nonsense wisdom, is an idea not confined to the Skywalker bloodline. Altogether, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” makes for an inventive nail-biter of a chapter in the franchise’s long run. It’s quite satisfying — or as satisfying as a movie can be when it, like “The Empire Strikes Back,” leaves the audience hanging for what happens next. ★★★1/2<br>Star Wars: The Last Jedi<br>The battle between the dark side and the light, between the First Order and the Resistance, has seldom been as exciting and emotional as this eighth chapter of the franchise.<br>Where • Theaters everywhere.<br>When • Opens Friday, Dec. 15.<br>Rating • PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi action and violence.<br>Running time • 152 minutes."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Sequels, prequels... it’s one big bucket of quels. Both are the enemy of imagination. Both can tarnish that crystallised legacy that sits in your mind. Nothing in three films of backstory could ever have matched what you might have pondered regarding Anakin Skywalker’s descent into darkness, and likewise, did you really want to know what happened to your heroes 30 years later? When age kicks in and dreams burn down? No good can come of that, surely. That, though, is exactly what The Last Jedi writer/director Rian Johnson delves into. It’s heavy. JJ Abrams’ The Force Awakens was a grinning romp that relied too much on nostalgia, but set up exciting challenges for Johnson to deal with. In turn, he has done things you wouldn’t predict of any sequel, let alone a Star Wars one. The Last Jedi is alive with subversion, blindsiding you from all angles. It’s a string of shockers. Johnson picks up where Abrams left off, with Rey (Daisy Ridley) in search of her own identity, as well as galactic salvation, with a self-exiled Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill); frustrated Vader fanboy Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) scarred and furious; Leia (Carrie Fisher) in charge of a diminished Resistance. The First Order have them on their knees. Everyone’s up for a fight – and everyone’s broken. Around halfway through we’re taken to casino city Canto Bight, filmed in Croatia but basically Monte Carlo in space, described by Johnson as “a playground for rich assholes.” It’s not integral to the plot, but it is to the theme, and to Johnson’s perspective, a commentary on the politics of money and war, an ethical abyss, which is something of a thread. In a real world that’s increasingly binary, Johnson gets his hands dirty in the grey areas. The Last Jedi is all about blurred lines. Myths and legends are not just deconstructed but torn apart, while Philip Larkin would enjoy the take on parental issues. Star Wars has always been about this, but Johnson tackles it more thoughtfully than anyone yet. He digs deep into the philosophies that George Lucas drew from. He challenges and confronts it, playfully and sometimes frighteningly, exploring it with intelligence and consideration, taking it beyond the superficial. There is much emphasis on fallibility, responsibility, accountability – immense humanity among all the fantasy, skewering the two-dimensional Hollywood archetypes we’ve come to accept in big-budget blockbusters. A few months back, Mark Hamill said that after reading the script he told Johnson that he “fundamentally” disagreed “with every choice” the director made for Luke, and as the film unfolds, you can see why. But, regardless of the fact that Hamill may well have been given a rap on the knuckles for saying that, he later admitted that he was wrong, and as the film progresses, those choices bear fruit. This is decidedly not about instant gratification and quick fixes. The characters here get stripped of everything, psychologically decimated. It’s an across the board dismantling of ego, which is thrilling: some real meat to accompany the constant sugar rush. And it is a rush, even at over two and a half hours. There is a lot to process, and a lot going on. Every second, every shot – for better or worse – just feels like, ""New Star Wars stuff is happening! New Star Wars stuff is happening!’ There is just so much *Star Wars *stuff happening. There are only so many galactic battles you can handle, and on occasion it really does feel like an assault, to numbing effect. Some action sequences are superfluous and unengaging. Benicio del Toro all but cameos as a sort of hobo hustler, while John Boyega’s Finn is sidelined, relegated to relatively inconsequential hi-jinx. Many of the new creatures are a delight – the Porgs are more fun and less cloying than you might fear – while others seems straight out of The Neverending Story. It’s funny, though not always when you want it to be – perhaps fearing too much gravitas, Johnson undermines it a little too often. And Domhnall Gleeson’s permanently seething General Hux still gurns and grimaces like something from ‘Allo ‘Allo! But these are quibbles. Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron is a fantastic Han Solo substitute. Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren is consistently confounding, a fascinating character, certainly in something like this. The dark Snoke, previously seen as a hologram, is a disgusting old bastard, hellish to behold in the flesh and ghoulishly voiced by Andy Serkis, while newbies Laura Dern, as Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, and Kellie Marie Tran, as Resistance fighter Rose Tico, exude depth and purpose, beautifully written, layered characters. There is fan service – a lot of it (does every bar in the galaxy feature a steel drum band?). But none of it is as clunky as some of The Force Awakens’ cheapest shots. It’s certainly executed with less nods and winks and, more importantly, the weightier callbacks have real emotional depth, precipitating immediate tears. There is also some welcome conceptual weirdness that is Rian Johnson through and through. His previous film, 2012’s Looper, was a sci-fi mindbender, and much credit should go to Star Wars producer/caretaker Kathleen Kennedy for giving him the keys to the galaxy and letting him run free. The man has big balls. He takes no prisoners here. Everything is respected, but nothing is sacred. It’s a sweeping gut-punch. How it deals with our own hopes and dreams for these characters, and how deep it cuts into existential concerns that drive us all – its effects will run around in the mind for some time. A day later, I feel troubled and slightly shaken by it all. How often do you get that from something like this?

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"A fresh visual style makes this middle ""Star Wars"" a welcome addition to the saga."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," All films in the ongoing Star Wars saga begin with the words “A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away…”, followed by a triangular block of prefatory text that slowly drifts away from the viewer’s gaze, as though the story itself, even as we struggle to keep up with it, is disappearing into the distance before our very eyes. This is the archaeological essence of a franchise that is always looking back to a past that is ever present – and ever receding. By the time what was originally called Star Wars (1977) had become known as Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope (accounts differ as to when precisely this happened), it was already being suggested that the first film’s optimistic themes (of good triumphing over evil) were part of a cycle, with young Luke Skywalker just the latest in a long line of new hopes that had emerged through time, even as he yearned to live up to the reported heroics of his long-lost father Anakin, whose values and allegiances were to prove rather more slippery than his legendary reputation would suggest. Luke’s conflicts, both external and internal, were also eternal, playing out not just over the course of the first trilogy, but finding their echoing dark reverse in the prequel trilogy (with its focus on Anakin’s own coming of age), and now taking on their latest incarnation in this newest trilogy. Where Lucas’ first films looked back to the influence of Akira Kurosawa’s The Hidden Fortress from 1958, or of Flash Gordons’ serial adventures in the 1930s, or of even more ancient mythic archetypes, this newer trilogy need merely look back to the first one, excavating all its old tropes for our new millennium. J.J. Abrams’ Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) was a next-generation sequel, but also barely disguised its parallel status as a reimagining of the 1977 film, revisiting all the original’s key sequences while fleshing them out with all the new hope of a fresh young cast with altered genders and ethnicities – a changing of the guard for changing times. The Last Jedi plays a similar game, renewing many sequences from the first Star Wars sequel, The Empire Strikes Back (1980). If Rey (Daisy Ridley) is the new Luke, now she has the much older Luke (Mark Hamill) as trainer and mentor to direct her efforts, much as Luke himself previously (and still) had Yoda as his guru. If the mysterious Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) is essentially the Emperor, and his apprentice Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is a new Darth Vader in the making, then Vader is expressly cited as Ren’s model, and also related to him by blood (as Ren’s maternal grandfather). There are, in The Last Jedi, versions of Hoth, Dagobah and Cloud City by other names – as well as much Destroyer on Resistance (= the new Rebel Alliance) action. The personnel and planetary terrains may have changed along with some of the tech, but we are nonetheless on familiar ground here, well charted by the markers of legacy. Yet there is a striving in The Last Jedi for a different dynamic, a new direction – and it is led by the recalcitrant, tantrum-prone Ren. “Let the past go,” he tells Rey. “Kill it, if you have to. That’s the only way to become who you were meant to be.” After all, Ren’s patricidal actions in The Force Awakens had already established him as an iconoclastic destroyer of his own history – or perhaps as just another rebellious kid caught in a recurrent Oedipal cycle (remember that Vader had also killed his surrogate father Kenobi near the end of Star Wars). With his words to Rey, Ren is describing a tendency in this film. For while the Force, as described by Luke to Rey, involves a balancing of Darkness and Light, The Last Jedi is equally concerned with the strange, self-correcting symmetry between old and new. Ren seeks to escape his roots (his mother, his father, his old mentor Luke, even Snoke) no less keenly than the Resistance seeks to escape the relentless pursuit of the First Order – yet, as always in this saga, “It’s a trap”, and a momentary escape is all part of the inexorable pull of time’s tractor beam, back into the future. General Leia (Carrie Fisher) may be older now, and may be the ranking general of the last Resistance fighters left, but she is essentially fighting the same battles against the same impossible odds that she was already waging when we first met her 40 years earlier. Conversely, the vision that Ren has for a glorious new future sounds uncannily like a repetition of the status quo – or just another episode in a continuing saga. Luke imagines, hopes even, that he will be the last Jedi, but it hardly takes his Force powers of cosmic intuition and holistic humbug to know there will always be another Jedi to follow. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Even cinema requires a mix of darkness and light. While Ren is busy taking a light sabre to his very own foundations, there is a lot of talk among the Resistance not just of surviving to be the spark that lights hope’s beacon across the universe, but also of going home – that most nostalgic of urges. Nostalgia has always been precisely what this franchise offers to viewers – and so, while writer/director Rian Johnson (Brick, The Brothers Bloom, Looper) may strain to deviate from the received Star Wars formula, he always circles back to it – so that we can all be transported home to our own receding childhoods. No matter how many exotic creatures and internecine struggles, no matter how many tortuous twists, eleventh-hour interventions and magical miracles, that galaxy far, far away may accommodate, it is a remarkably closed system, reechoing the same themes across the ages, and preferring regression and eternal return to anything like progress. In a sense, Ren’s (and Luke’s) burn-it-all-down spirit of reformism does leave the next sequel wide open (it is hard to see how it can be a return of the Return of the Jedi‘s plotting). It also leaves things exactly where all the Star Wars films (apart from the more future-oriented prequels) leave things: with ragtag rebels on the run from oppressive patriarchal powers (of bankers, gangsters, superrich élites, imperialist fascists, or daddy). It is a fugitive position to which practically all young – or young-at-heart – viewers can relate, watching on-screen avatars seeking to carve out individual identity within the limits of their inheritance, and struggling to shake off the masks that conceal their differences of race and gender. Johnson is a tremendous director, keeping what is essentially an extended chase movie barrelling along for its epic duration. In finding ways to bridge the spaces between his different characters – from Poe (Oscar Isaac) radioing General Hux (Domnhall Gleeson) as though from a call centre, to Ren and Rey conversing, even making physical contact, across the galaxy through the powers of the Force – Johnson suggests the way that these events, unfolding so long ago and so very far away, might still reach out to us and our own not entirely dissimilar daily conflicts. It is hard to say whether this latest Star Wars film is also the best, so dependent is it on the weight of all that has preceded, and of a future that already feels programmed and prescribed by the Disney Empire – but it is certainly not, despite its title, the Last (any more than Snoke’s totalitarian Order is the First). For its ongoing narrative leads eventually all the way back (and forward) to our own place and time, touching on who we are, if through a dark, distorted mirror. And if in Johnson’s hands this saga is now self-aware enough to know its own mythic status – where figures not only like the older Luke and Leia, but also the much younger Rey and Finn (John Boyega), are already the stuff of galactic story – these characters (re)discover that in order to spread new hope, you may as well keep printing the old legend."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"  J.J. Abrams had an unenviable task two years ago when he set out to make what became The Force Awakens: reboot Star Wars without changing anything. And to his credit, he did just that by making a shockingly giddy reinvention of that galaxy far, far away that also played like the greatest hits of what came before. But for all his success, the rewards found in The Last Jedi prove even greater. At last we have, for the first time in ages, a Star Wars movie that’s all too happy to go where we don’t expect. To be sure, Rian Johnson’s evocative and often exhilarating sequel continues the post-Disney mandate to remix elements that bask in the familiar. Hence why the First Order is even more imperial this time, striking back against Resistance forces who look increasingly like rebels; Jedi and evil sorcerers alike sit in chairs while skeptically sizing up would-be apprentices; and we even get an epic battle on a planet that may as well be called Salt Hoth given how powdery white those crystals look when the AT-M6 walkers stomp across the landscape like mechanized buffalo grazing during the dregs of winter. Yet within all this repetition, Johnson uses his solitary writing and directing duties to massage and then manipulate our nostalgia. His film subverts and seduces, twists and turns, and frankly challenges us just when the audience dares to get too comfortable. It also gives a needed shot of adrenaline to the numerical Star Wars films that, by the end, leaves you uncertain what is up and what is down, or what is light and what is dark. Still, most will be delighted to jump to lightspeed to find out. That alone makes this vision far less ominous than the marketing suggests. Without giving too much away, The Last Jedi is largely a 152-minute chase across the stars. After a spectacular opening battle, the rebellious and tattered Resistance, led by an unsinkable General Leia (Carrie Fisher), spends much of the film fleeing through the cosmos with the First Order nipping at their heels. Despite suffering a grievous blow at the end of the last movie, Andy Serkis’ Supreme Leader Snoke has regrouped his armies and is unfazed as he reinstates fascist rule throughout the galaxy. Intriguingly, however, no matter how high the stakes are raised in this intergalactic grudge match, the most compelling events are occurring on a little island that looks an awful lot like Ireland. In actuality though, it’s Ahch-To, and it is there that this movie picks up right where The Force Awakens left off. Rey (Daisy Ridley) has come to recruit Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) back into the good fight. Unfortunately, she finds him… less than receptive. Worse still, not only does Luke refuse to get back onto the Millennium Falcon, but this last of the Jedi also demurs from training Rey in his ancient religion. Instead he views his guest as first a nuisance and then later as something akin to his last pupil, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). She’s dangeorus. As it turns out, there are many similarities between Rey and Ren that extends beyond their names, and the more it haunts Luke, the more resistant he becomes. Thus Rey is tempted to seek answers from the other party of this failed master and padawan relationship, just as the First Order begins closing the gap between itself and the wounded Resistance Fleet. Remarkably in spite of its length, The Last Jedi is mostly able to keep things moving at an even keel and with a tonal dexterity that is unusual for the franchise. While the movie borrows more than a few elements from the beloved middle chapter of the original Star Wars Trilogy, The Empire Strikes Back (plus some of Return of the Jedi too), Rian Johnson has infused the material with his own decidedly playful sensibility. With more than a hint of self-deprecation, the movie flips on a dime from the reverential and earnest awe that Abrams placed in his worshipful predecessor to gags with the sharpest sense of humor this side of Jabba’s Palace. (Seriously, the little Porg aliens who infest Ahch-To threaten to steal the whole film.) This is not to say that The Last Jedi ever risks erring into the realm of comedy, or even the pseudo-comedies of Lucasfilm’s sister Disney division, Marvel Studios. There is simply a noticeable dedication to freshen up what is considered appropriate Star Wars, all while maintaining the genuinely gee-whiz delight that has long been entrenched in this saga. The effect intentionally buttresses the familial melodrama that comes in the film’s second half, which crescendos nicely into a grandiose opera by the finale. But to get there, it can at times feel overstuffed, even at two and a half hours. Cut and cropped at a dizzying pace, the top-heavy editing of The Last Jedi suggests Johnson had to still squeeze his already fast-paced yarn into its luxurious running time. This is all the more peculiar since much of the narrative that doesn’t involve Rey, Kylo, or Luke can sometimes appear irrelevant during the middle. For instance, Finn (John Boyega) and newcomer Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) attempt an espionage mission that takes them to what is the Star Wars equivalent of the French Riviera. It’s a casino city named Canto Bight, and their adventures here push the Rick’s Café sensibilities from the original Star Wars’ cantina sequence to their limit. Nevertheless, this entire subplot amounts to a whole lot of padding while the real tough and revelatory decisions are made on Ahch-To. In an even more supporting role is Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron. While Poe still plays third banana to Rey and Finn, his increasingly complicated relationship with Leia and Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern) is one of the stronger elements of the picture, and provides the Star Wars universe with another wonderfully realized female leader. It also allows Isaac to ever more defiantly slouch into the Han Solo role of the next generation, a neat feat for an actor who was supposed to have only cameoed in The Force Awakens. Still, the movie belongs to its revered history. Hamill plays Luke as gnarly and grim, and almost wholly unlike the farmboy or heroic Jedi we remember from 35 years ago. Leia is conversely even more like the late-great Carrie Fisher this time around: She’s dry, sardonic, and lovably deadpan. Developing the wit of Hollywood royalty to accompany her onscreen princess title, Leia’s grace and Luke’s mercurial misery are what ties the film together. This movie is very much about them accepting the past and bequeathing their future to young people who are more than just the franchise’s fresh crop this time around—they’ve become true heirs. The heavy lifting Johnson does—balanced with more than a little fan service—causes The Last Jedi to be Star Wars’ true legacy film. With the torch already passed before the opening crawl, the protagonists now wield this heritage as swiftly as a lightsaber, and when it comes down to the pairing of Ridley and Driver, the movie crackles with real force. Much of the film is about Hamill letting go of the past, but with Ridley and Driver bringing considerable heat and shadings of equivocacy to their roles, they each promise a future for Star Wars more layered than good versus evil, or Jedi versus Sith. (Driver also confirms Kylo to be one of the decade’s best baddies.) It is in their scenes together the film finds its true spark, and it’s one that lights up the movie’s numerous and impressive action sequences. With a painterly eye and the showmanship of an old school Western epic, Johnson draws each battle and lightsaber sequence with the kind of visual poetry and patience almost forgotten at the blockbuster level—and populates it with characters who are not just lovable, but now are also very, very troubled. By the end, an ambiguity has seeped into the Star Wars universe, and with it, a new overcast gray hangs above all the players. Yet the contrast just makes them and the hue of their blades pop all the brighter. Every new Star Wars movie since Disney bought Lucasfilm has been heralded as the first worthy successor to the Original Trilogy, but with The Last Jedi it’s finally true. "

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," 
	If this review of Star Wars: The Last Jedi contains no spoilers, that will be in part because there isn’t much to spoil. This is no reflection on the quality of the eighth episode. (Or ninth if you include last year’s excellent stand-alone film Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.) In the hands of the writer-director Rian Johnson, who arrives by way of lively genre experiments such as Brick and Looper, The Last Jedi is a more distinctive and lighthearted work than the karaoke retread represented by The Force Awakens, with which the latest cycle of Star Wars movies began in 2015. 
	From the moment early on when the Rebel fighter pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaacs) toys with the evil ginger rockabilly General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) during a silly bit of telephone chit-chat, notice is given that daftness will have its place among the franchise’s customary leaden mythologising. As for shock twists, what can I tell you? Chewbacca contemplates vegetarianism. It doesn’t get much bigger than that. 
	This is indicative of Johnson’s approach: look after the details and the rest will take care of itself. It doesn’t quite work out that way. The asides are often amusing and the characters, including the returning hero Finn (John Boyega), his plucky fan Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and the shifty computer wizard DJ (Benicio Del Toro), largely engaging. A handful of the visual gags are even inspired; one, involving a fearsome spacecraft making its landing, undercuts delightfully the usual Star Wars pomposity. 
	In the final analysis, though, this is still a film about an attempt to turn off a tracking device. There’s no getting around that. Poe, DJ, Rose and Finn, who sound like a new generation of Teletubbies, are given the task of secreting themselves on board an Imperial battleship and disabling its capacity for monitoring Rebel forces. 
	I appreciate that not every Star Wars movie can revolve around the destruction of a Death Star, and nor would anyone wish it to, but this must be said to be at the low end of compelling. However many special effects are thrown at the film, however demonstrative the score, it is still not the 40th-anniversary high-point that might have been hoped for. 
	It is indeed four decades since Star Wars, as it was then known, or Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, as purists insist we now call it, was released in Britain. On December 27 1977 it began its London engagement at the Odeon Leicester Square, saturating the provinces over the next few months. 
	Nowadays the hoopla would cause servers to crash and websites to go down and the internet to come apart at the seams. How quaint, then, to flick through the December 1977 edition of Film Review magazine (25p from your local cinema!) and find the approaching phenomenon greeted with an unprecedented splash. “The Most Popular Film Ever Calls For Our Biggest Coverage Ever,” it screams. “So We’ve Given ‘Star Wars’ Nine Pages!” 
Nine? Woah. In an issue that also contained a “king-size” colour poster of Nick Nolte in The Deep and a feature entitled “Gene Hackman – A Busy Fella But a Bit of a Yeller,” this was almost too much excitement to take. 
	There in that nine-page spread is the Star Wars cast, all impossibly young and hopeful: Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, a smooth-skinned, blond-haired go-getter in karate whites; Harrison Ford as Han Solo, looking blasé already about the unimaginable level of fame coming over the horizon in his direction; and Carrie Fisher jutting out her chin with maximum sass as Princess Leia and trying not to buckle under the weight of her own hair. 
	Things look very different now. Hamill, glimpsed in a cowl at the end of The Force Awakens, is back in The Last Jedi as Luke, exhibiting a level of hirsuteness at which even the hardiest Hoxton barber would balk. Tricky, in some shots, to tell him apart from Chewbacca. He’s been holed up at his inhospitable country hideaway to escape all the Jedi nonsense. “Do you think I came to the most unfindable place in the galaxy for no reason at all?” he asks the Rebels’ new superstar, Rey (Daisy Ridley). Embarrassingly for Luke, she has succeeded in finding him, but she at least has the good grace not to point out that you can’t have degrees of unfindability. You either are or you aren’t. 
	She hopes Luke will teach her the ways of the Force, much as Yoda taught him. She has seen his daily routine, as she gently points out, and it’s not as if he’s busy. He spends his time catching giant fish with the world’s longest spear. If he has the afternoon free, he might attach a breast-pump to a pot-bellied diplodocus and quaff down its milk in one go. The hours pass slowly when there’s little or no phone coverage. 
	Ford as Han is absent, having been killed inconveniently in The Force Awakens by his own son, the dastardly but conflicted Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). And it’s only right that the new movie should be dedicated to Carrie Fisher, who died last December shortly after finishing most of her scenes as Leia. For the remainder, some digital jiggery-pokery was required to put her into places she never actually went. Though one shot of Leia in a spaceship, gazing mournfully out of a floor-to-ceiling window at a battle taking place in the distance, must be very much like another. 
	That process of inserting characters artificially into shots is echoed in one of the plot devices cooked up by Johnson. When Rey interacts with Kylo Ren, she does so via a process that brings them into the same optical and psychological space, no matter that they might be at opposite ends of the galaxy. In the world of the film, it’s a Jedi mind trick, though we know it better as FaceTime. 
	Rey is trying to tempt Ren over to the side of the angels. He is, after all, a former pupil of Luke’s, though their association ended messily. Cross words were exchanged, light sabers brandished, a school burned down, the usual. 
	Ren, for his part, wants to enlist Rey as a minion to his own master, the crease-faced Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) who looks like Wilfred Brambell in a gold dressing-gown, if you can imagine such a thing. Creature design is one of the strong suits of a good Star Wars film, and The Last Jedi doesn’t stop at lactating diplodocuses. There are icy-horned lynxes whose frosty coats seem to jangle and clatter. (Finn refers to them as “Crystal Critters”.) A family of cuddly birds will look familiar to anyone who was swept up in the 1990s Furby craze. 
	They’re no competition for the most memorable human cast members. The incomparable Laura Dern shows up for a few scenes as Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, continuing the Star Wars tradition of characters who get their names from an arbitrary assortment of Scrabble tiles. Dern is so tough she’s the only one allowed to acknowledge an alternative belief system to the Force (“God speed,” she says). Put her in any shot and its dynamism factor escalates tenfold, not least when she is wearing, as she is here, a ruched caramel toga with a matching half-snood, and a violet rinse worthy of Mrs Slocombe. Few performers could exude gravitas in a get-up which combines ancient Greece with Are You Being Served? but Dern is one of them. 
	The only other performer impervious to the negative effects of appearing in a Star Wars movie – a tendency to sag under the weight of exposition, a weariness at striking the same reaction shots or pretending not to want to kick a droid – is Adam Driver. As though acknowledging the magnetic qualities of his feral physiognomy, he spends some of his time smashing up the headgear that obscured his face in parts of The Force Awakens, after he is accused by Snoke of being nothing more than “a child in a mask.” 
	He and Rey are both out to prove themselves but Driver, with his capacity for playing arrogant angel and self-doubting devil in the same shot, has the more absorbing challenge and the greater range for exploring it. 
	Even Johnson’s sense of fun and mischief can’t sustain the film for two-and-a-half hours; the warring gets boring. One scene is replayed three times with different interpretations but it’s hardly Rashomon and a movie this long can’t afford to dawdle. No one could mistake The Last Jedi for an outstanding contribution to cinema, or even to escapism, but it has its attractions. 
	As long as the franchise can throw enough temptations at Driver to keep him on board, there will be a reason to turn up for episodes nine, ten and beyond. The Rebels talk constantly of sparks and flames, optimism and faith, but it is in this infinitely fascinating actor that the series has found its most convincing new hope."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," When J.J. Abrams and writers Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt rebooted the Star Wars film franchise in 2015 with The Force Awakens — the first in a sequel trilogy, following the original Star Wars trifecta of 1977’s A New Hope, 1980’s The Empire Strikes Back, and 1983’s Return of the Jedi — they found a fairly winning formula that split the difference between respecting fans’ love for the original trilogy, and nudging the franchise into the future. They introduced new characters and centered the story around them, but that story was remarkably close to a retelling of A New Hope, complete with new Empire and Rebellion analogues facing off, a new Death Star to destroy, a new Luke Skywalker equivalent trying to escape a new backwater desert planet, and so forth. At the same time, Abrams and company brought back A New Hope’s original Luke / Leia / Han Solo / Chewbacca quartet, and set them up as beloved legends whom the new characters all but worship. It was a smart approach in terms of giving fans something familiar to embrace while easing them into the series’s inevitable generational shift, but nostalgia has its limits, and it was hard to escape the feeling that The Force Awakens wasn’t a new film, so much as a jaunty modern remix of a familiar one. Given that foundation, Brick and Looper writer-director Rian Johnson had a few obvious options with The Last Jedi: continue the trend and remix The Empire Strikes Back into a 2017 version, or buck the trend, move sharply away from the legacy content, and push the series away from familiar places. Instead, he chose a less-obvious option: he did both. The Last Jedi does feature sequences that directly recall The Empire Strikes Back, though Johnson’s script uses their familiarity to play against expectations and subvert viewers’ nostalgia, instead of paying it off. But he also borrows from Return of the Jedi, compressing the rest of the original trilogy into a single fast-moving, far-reaching story. And he makes some even more radical choices, abruptly shutting down open storylines and wrapping up loose threads. There’s been some fan concern that Last Jedi might mimic Empire Strikes Back too closely, down to the dark tone and open ending. Instead, Johnson’s film feels remarkably close to a coda for the new trilogy, a platform for a radical departure from canon when the untitled sequel arrives in 2019.  And Johnson is certainly aware of how far and how fast he’s pushing this well-worn narrative. His characters repeatedly talk about the need to put the past aside, to make their own choices and accept the future, to discard everything they’ve been holding onto, because it’s been holding them back. The “let it go” theme is so pronounced that it sometimes feels like a repudiation of both The Force Awakens and the fandom itself. Last Jedi is often a painful, mournful film about loss: as the bleak story unfolds, the characters lose allies and friends and family, agency and options, treasured illusions and ideals. They lose significant objects tied to their identities. They lose confidence and cockiness and hope. Some of them lose their lives. Not all those losses are defeats, but it’s unmistakable how much of the Star Wars mythos lovingly re-created and embraced in The Force Awakens crumbles to ash in The Last Jedi, and how the series’s wisest characters embrace that process as a painful but necessary rebirth. Amid all that, though, Johnson finds plenty of room for familiar thrilling Star Wars adventure, from a Rogue One-style information-and-infiltration scheme to Phantom Menace-style rambunctious, CGI-forward chase sequences. He piles on the space dogfights and lightsaber duels. He significantly expands the roster of Force-related powers, in ways that are going to prompt endless fan debate (and resistance, and resentment, and backlash) after the fact, but that provide plenty of surprises along the way. And he fills in missing pieces of the past, implied in Force Awakens, and left as endlessly debated mysteries for fans. It’s surprising how neatly and succinctly Last Jedi wraps up the open-ended stories — there are still plenty of details left to address about the new characters’ pasts, but the film answers the trilogy’s biggest questions to date with a directness that feels blunt and pointed: “You need to move on, and you can’t until you have your answers. So here are those answers.” If Last Jedi is fundamentally meant as a rebirth for the Star Wars series, the way Johnson addresses fan questions is the sharp smack on the ass that’s meant to prompt a baby’s first wailing breath. But Johnson isn’t just being preemptory. The Last Jedi sprawls out over a 152-minute runtime that introduces new characters, including visually soft but emotionally steely Resistance leader Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern), sweet but not very useful Resistance techie Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), and drawling scoundrel hacker DJ (Benicio Del Toro). It separates the primary characters from Force Awakens, and gives them each their own separate story threads, spread across the galaxy. Johnson crams The Last Jedi with incident and sidelines, including new developments that radically shift the supposed direction of the franchise. It isn’t just a single-story movie, it’s a kind of wide-ranging, almost soap-operatic check-in on an immense cast of characters up to their own adventures. Johnson doesn’t fully justify all the side adventures, but he does weave them into the larger loss narrative, and into an ongoing attempt for the Resistance to live up to its name, while the evil First Order attempts to wipe it out completely. And Johnson tells that story while occasionally delving into a loopy sense of humor that’s 100 percent guaranteed to deeply offend some viewers. This might be a good time to remember that Star Wars has had its funny side from the very beginning, from the comic-relief sidekick duo of C-3PO and R2-D2 to Han Solo’s occasional bout of goofy incompetence. Johnson’s only radical step here is to extend that humor past the heroes, and let it briefly disrupt the villains’ solemnity as well. For a series that’s so often treated its primary antagonists as towering, intimidating bastions of evil, that feels radical, but it also punctures their balloons and makes them a little more ridiculously human. It isn’t a dominant or central choice — Johnson doesn’t have Supreme Leader Snoke cracking porg jokes — but it’s foregrounded in an unmissable way. And it’s likely to kick off a debate about whether Star Wars eventually needs its own version of Thor: Ragnarok, an idiosyncratic, obviously director-flavored, predominately humorous movie that gives its characters a hipshot, silly charm. Johnson doesn’t go nearly as far as Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi in re-creating a tentpole franchise in his own image. He doesn’t radically reinvent Star Wars with the looseness of his film The Brothers Bloom, or the creative rigor and conceptual daring of Brick. But he does dig into the impulses behind the new trilogy’s younger characters, cracking them open and examining their psychology in a way Star Wars rarely has. Pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) comes in for some particularly intense scrutiny, as Johnson analyzes and dismisses a certain type of reckless hero complex, and the dangers that come with it. Up-and-coming Force user Rey (Daisy Ridley) gets a similarly brutal, unforgiving examination into her parent issues and her attachment to myths, both her self-created ones and the ones she’s absorbed about the Jedi. Johnson reveals a good deal more about villain-on-the-brink Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) — not just where he came from, but where his choices have taken him, and which ones he’s struggling to accept. The script spends less time on the martyr complex escaped First Order stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) is carrying around, and on the way General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) balances the necessary remove of leadership with her personal concern for her people, and her personal affection for some of them. But just the attempt to acknowledge and examine these archetypes makes the characters feel a little more fleshed-out and fulfilled, and makes the roles a little more meaningful. Where he can, Johnson lifts his characters outside of the predictable, familiar franchise narrative of heroes charging wildly forward and relying on luck and the Force to get them through whatever they’re facing. The results are often messy, and not entirely satisfying. But that describes rebirths in general. The Last Jedi is often a painful one, with the losses stacking high by the final frames. (Carrie Fisher’s prominent, touchingly elegiac role is a particularly poignant reminder of a real-world loss.) The Star Wars movies have always lived in nostalgia, even starting back in 1977, when George Lucas first slapped together a space adventure out of a mixture of Westerns, Akira Kurosawa samurai movies, Buck Rogers serial adventures, and 1940s screwball comedies. There has always been tension around that nostalgia for series fans, going back as far as Return of the Jedi, and extending divisively into the 2000s prequel trilogy. Some fans have embraced the series’s habit of returning to the same wells, and rejected any changes in tone, look, or content. Others have vocally resented the way Star Wars’ constant re-echoing of its own past has limited the directions the story could take. The Last Jedi feels like a deliberate, thought-through corrective. It sums up its theme in its title: it’s trying, as respectfully and carefully as possible, to let go of some of the old traditions, and look for the next steps for a world that’s rapidly expanding, and needs to escape its old, familiar conflicts if it’s going to grow. Johnson acknowledges, through the characters and the dialogue, that letting go of familiar things is hard, and he holds his audience’s hands through the process. But he’s also admirably merciless about it. Audiences will likely come away from The Last Jedi with a lot of complaints and questions. But they’re at least likely to feel they’re in the hands of someone who cares about the series as much as they do, someone who loves its history, but sees the wide-open future ahead of it as well."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Star Wars: The Last Jedi did something that no other Star Wars film has done since 1980 – it surprised me. My adoration for this Saga is unlimited, but I didn’t think it could still do that. The Force Awakens is so much a note-for-note cover of the original film that, while it’s still entertaining, you can see the turns of the plot from a few parsecs away. But almost immediately, writer/director Rian Johnson throws out the template from the previous films and goes straight into uncharted territory. It’s still very much Star Wars, but not as beholden in tone and pace to the previous films. Because of that, The Last Jedi works best when you aren’t trying to crack open the plot and instead just allow the film take you where it wants to take you. To that end, The Last Jedi is a whopping two hours and thirty minutes long, and at times, yes, you feel it. But in that good way, the way you do when spending time with friends that you care about. Not just the old characters we know and love like Luke, Leia, Chewie, or C-3PO, and not just these new additions like Rey, Poe, Finn, and Kylo Ren, but characters like Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose, or Laura Dern’s Vice Admiral Holdo, or Benicio Del Toro’s DJ. Everyone has a great moment to shine, and everyone’s story is full of urgency and importance. The stakes in The Last Jedi have never been higher, and that is saying something in a franchise that destroys entire planets from time to time. There are moments in The Last Jedi that it is entirely unclear whether or not our heroes will make it out alive, much less succeed. An awful lot happens this time around, and during crucial moments, I wasn’t sure where this story would go next, which I found to be incredibly exciting. Let’s get down to it – this is Mark Hamill’s best performance as Luke Skywalker, bar none. This is a Jedi Master weary of wars and battles, and of seeing loved ones die or be consumed, and Hamill puts it all in his eyes. He is a broken man when Rey finds him on that island, and not the hero of legend and lore that Rey always believed. Hamill, in his first moments onscreen, made me audibly gasp at some of the choices that he and Rian Johnson make with the character. (I gasped a lot at The Last Jedi.) There’s something reminiscent of Clint Eastwood’s world-weary gunslinger in Hamill’s work here, but having seen the idealistic, brave Jedi Knight in films past, the places Hamill takes Skywalker in The Last Jedi are shocking and unsettling. It’s a brave performance, and I give Mark Hamill the highest marks for what he’s done. Star Wars films aren’t generally known for their acting caliber, but (and this may just be hyperbole talking) I wouldn’t mind seeing some awards push for Mark Hamill here. No less compelling is Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa, wracked with guilt and grief over the death of Han Solo and the monster her son, Ben Solo/Kylo Ren, has become. Leia, through all her pain and struggle, still must make the hard choices that will push the Resistance forward. The loss of Carrie Fisher last year fills many of her scenes with sadness and melancholy, and there will be many tears shed over her work here, no doubt. But this is also some of the strongest work she’s ever done in the character. She shows us all what true leadership is, the risks and heartbreak that are involved, and Fisher reminds us all of how great an actress she was when she was given good material. Rian Johnson gives both Luke and Leia the proper attention and respect, and it’s not just based on nostalgia for their other Star Wars films, either. Hamill and Fisher are given rich opportunities to explore Luke and Leia in unexpected, rich emotional ways. Daisy Ridley as Rey is given even more to do than in The Force Awakens. We expect Rey to take the route that we’ve seen from characters like hers in the other films, but, again, Rian Johnson and Daisy Ridley play with those expectations and take us to places we do not expect. The same goes for Adam Driver’s performance as Kylo Ren, a man who is unhinged, lost, and searching for any way he can to find his own place in the galaxy. The nature of Rey and Kylo’s relationship in The Last Jedi is best revealed in the film, but both Ridley and Driver fill their characters with uncertainty, fear, and not a little anger. Both Rey and Kylo are being manipulated by outside forces beyond their control, and both strain against the boundaries that their destinies have placed them inside. John Boyega’s Finn is no less restrained, and Finn must figure out a way to help Rey and the Resistance in their time of dire need. To that end, Finn gets the help of Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), a Resistance tech who wants to prove herself among all these heroes and legends. Boyega and Tran have nice chemistry together, and I loved their desperate act to stop the First Order, which pays off in a couple of rollicking action sequences. Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron gets, hands down, the funniest moment of the film (and there are quite a bit of those – The Last Jedi may be the funniest film of the Saga in a lot of ways), and he also is forced to make decisions and compromises that go against what he believes to be right. Most of those conflicts are between Poe and Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), a leader who on the surface does not seem to have the best interests of the Resistance at heart, at least to Poe’s understanding. The Last Jedi has many moments that subvert expectations, and considering that these are expectations that have been built up for many years now, I have to give credit, again, to Rian Johnson, a director steeped in film knowledge but someone who also knows how to apply that knowledge to tell a compelling story. The Last Jedi isn’t afraid to play with some of the more political themes and ideas of the day, either, which makes the film that much richer in context and power. Star Wars films were always like that; even the first one was a reaction to the Nixon years. Even the Prequels did it; while they might not have been entirely successful, the story of how a democratic government was twisted by a fascist despot is all in there. The Last Jedi has a lot to say about heroism, our ideals, and how we can fail to live up to them. This isn’t empty spectacle, and at its best, Star Wars always had more on its mind than its detractors gave it credit for – how the bonds of friendship and family are tested by strife and war, or how a government could be consumed with power-hungry leaders, or how blind faith can sometimes steer people down the wrong path. There is a morality to these films that shouldn’t be dismissed, and Rian Johnson takes what we know about that morality and puts it through the test, and thus, the audience is put to the test as well. John Williams’ score this time around is better than The Force Awakens – he gives everything the proper scope and grandeur. The action sequences of The Last JediI are some of the most exciting we’ve seen yet in the Saga. This isn’t as simple as destroying a space station – instead, everyone is fighting for their very lives, and because the stakes are so high, we become even more invested than before. This is not a film that pulls punches. People die, and we feel those losses acutely. Even in previous films of the Saga, we never felt as connected to them as we do in The Last Jedi. There is a propulsion and intensity that will likely put audiences at the edges of their seats. Johnson keeps everything thrilling and exciting, but fills those moments with power and emotion. You may find yourself tearing up at the grand scale of all of it. Rian Johnson manipulates us in all the best cinematic ways. There are moments to cheer, moments of tears, moments that cause us to gasp for breath, and moments where we are genuinely afraid for our heroes. As with the serial adventures of yesteryear, Star Wars: The Last Jedi fills its screen with the possibilities of adventure, spirit, and rich emotional storytelling. This is the most exciting Star Wars film in years – dangerous, unpredictable, and powerful. At the end of The Last Jedi, I was left in the same place that I was that fateful day in May, 1980, when the universe I thought I knew had been upended and everything was left in chaos. While The Last Jedi isn’t similar to The Empire Strikes Back in plot, it is very close to it in terms of the emotion and the power on display. This is going to be an excruciatingly long two years to wait. Until then, we have been given a remarkable gift, those of us who have been fans since 1977 – we cannot wait to find out what happens next. This is my favorite Star Wars film, and that is saying something."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the quintessential Star Wars movie. It embraces everything in the franchise that came before while taking big risks to push the story into new and unexpected places. While there are a few subplots that weigh it down in the middle, everything ultimately works toward delivering an absolutely stunning sequence of events that make its emotionally rich ending a possibility. It’s dramatic, it’s exciting, it’s heartfelt, it’s heartbreaking, and it’s funnier than any Star Wars movie has any right to be. It doesn’t answer every lingering fan question but it darn well delivers on the ones it chooses to address, ending things on a satisfying note even though there’s one more chapter in this trilogy. And on top of all that, the final scene bucks all Star Wars trends, yet it works because it’s reflective of what makes the saga as a whole so special."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Whatever box office records Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi is going to break, one thing is certain. At 152 minutes, Episode VIII is the longest instalment since the sci-fi phenomenon began in 1977 under George Lucas in what now feels like a galaxy far, far away. This is an emotional ride all right, an incident-packed epic that introduces new characters, reacquaints us with old friends, answers some questions and raises some more. In only his fourth movie, after Brick (2005), The Brothers Bloom (2008) and the slick time-travelling Looper (2012), Johnson takes the reins from J.J. Abrams, who got the franchise back on track with 2015’s The Force Awakens, which hit the mark with cinema-goers, grossing US$2 billion . If there was a criticism of Abrams’ film, it was that it rather borrowed plot-lines and themes from the first Star Wars film, now known as A New Hope. Johnson, who also wrote the script for The Last Jedi, has done his very best not to follow suit and rip from the second Star Wars filmt, The Empire Strikes Back, although there are still echoes – characters, vehicles, landscapes – that remain. And, like that 1980 film, the villains have the upper hand. “The First Order reigns,” says the traditional opening text that crawls up onto the screen. As everyone who saw The Force Awakens knows, newcomer Rey (Daisy Ridley) was sent to a remote island to bring back Jedi Master Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) from his self-imposed exile. The “legend”, as he mockingly calls himself, doesn’t want to know; as Rey puts it, he has “closed himself off from the Force” – the mysterious and powerful energy field that bonds life itself. While Luke and Rey are engaging in a battle of wills, Luke’s sister General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) is commanding what’s left of the Resistance, with The First Order – led by the evil Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) and his very shouty deputy General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) – looking to crush them into oblivion. Then there’s Snoke’s protégé Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), Leia’s son, still trying to prove his worth after killing his own father, Han Solo. All Star Wars films need a mission of some kind to keep the engine purring. Here, new technology has allowed the rebels to be tracked through light speed, leading their beleaguered fleet to desperately try and outrun the powerful Star Destroyers of the First Order. The plan is for former Stormtrooper-turned-rebel Finn (John Boyega) to board a Star Destroyer and knock out a gizmo to allow the Resistance fleet to evade detection. With Finn joined by spherical droid BB-8 and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), a basement-level worker bee, it’s at this moment that the epic running time begins to bulge; a trip to a casino planet to find “a master codebreaker”, who may or may not be Benicio Del Toro’s stuttering rogue DJ, feels excessive. And we haven’t even had time yet to mention a purple-haired Laura Dern as Leia’s able second-in-command, ruling over the “flyboy” Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). Johnson levers much into the script, although classic characters like R2-D2, C-3P0 and Chewbacca are left with little to do. Rest assured, though, this looks and feels like a Star Wars movie, with headspinning space battles and thrilling light-sabre duels. There’s also great sacrifice, a theme that looms large from the outset, with the words “we are the spark that will light the fire” becoming a mantra of resistance against tyranny."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,Watching The Last Jedi is a conversation with your younger self.
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Immediately after the events of The Force Awakens, the First Order wastes no time in striking back against the Resistance. Supreme Leader Snoke, General Hux, and Kylo Ren bring all their forces to bear against General Leia and her small band of freedom fighters. Their fleet corners our heroes and begins picking off Resistance ships one by one as they flee their base. Despite the reckless efforts of Poe Dameron and the other Resistance members, their hope quickly fades…until a recently-revived Finn and a lowly technician named Rose Tico come up with a plan that will allow them to escape the First Order’s relentless pursuit. Meanwhile, Rey, Chewbacca, and R2-D2 have finally tracked down missing Jedi Master Luke Skywalker to bring him back to the Resistance and save the day. However, there’s one big problem – Luke doesn’t want to go. Determined to die as the last Jedi on a lonely island, he turns his back on them. Rey isn’t willing to give up just yet as she needs someone to guide her in using her newfound powers. But if Luke Skywalker won’t be the teacher she needs, Kylo Ren is ready to show her the ways of the Dark Side. The Last Jedi is a hard film to review without getting into spoilers, but I will do my best to keep this spoiler free. One way to do that is to speak at a high level, so I’ll say this – this film is filled with bold choices. From choices with classic characters like Luke and Leia to choices with new characters like Kylo Ren and Rey, every character has a moment that will surprise you. Rian Johnson made some fearless choices with all of them (or at least he made it look fearless). Some paid off and others didn’t, but overall you have to give him credit for taking the characters in new directions. On at least six different occasions in this movie I said to myself, “I can’t believe they just did that!” Another notable aspect of The Last Jedi is the humor. This is arguably the Star Wars movie with the most humor in the series. Despite the very dark themes in this movie, every character has a line of dialogue that makes you laugh. Leia, Rey, Luke, and even General Hux generate genuine laughs with their dialogue. And if you were afraid the little birds called porgs were going to be the new Ewoks or Jar-Jar, never fear. They provide much needed levity to the film during Rey and Luke’s heavy scenes. And some of the humor is downright dark, and I loved it. Sign me up as pro-porg. The action in The Last Jedi delivers in a big way. The opening space battle featuring Poe and BB-8 in their X-wing is one of the best dogfights in the series. And while there are a lot of great explosions, Rian Johnson takes a moment to put a face on the Resistance pilots and the price they pay to save Leia and the others. It adds much needed heart so that when the action hits, you care about what the characters are going through. That comes into play in a big way when we are treated to one of the best lightsaber fights in the entire Star Wars Saga. When it kicks into gear, it is absolutely stunning and the cheers of the audience will give you goosebumps. The carnage that ensues is everything a Star Wars fan could hope for. As for the cast, they are across the board excellent. Daisy Ridley returns as Rey and is as lovable as before. She has a number of scenes with Adam Driver as Kylo Ren and they are excellent together. The two enemies are forced to talk and their conversations are as intense and as emotional as their battles. There is a lot of payoff there from the seeds planted in The Force Awakens. Oscar Isaac also returns as Poe Dameron and he is fantastic. His dogfight scenes are perfectly executed and his relationship with BB-8 is as heartwarming as that between Luke and R2-D2. But his character is a lot more developed in this film. While his brashness and heart served him well in The Force Awakens, they get him in trouble in The Last Jedi. In short, Poe’s story arc in this film steers him to become the leader he needs to be for the Resistance. He’s got to “know when to walk away, know when to run”. The new characters are fun, too. Kelly Marie Tran is lovable as Rose Tico. She’s well-paired with John Boyega as Finn. When the skills of the characters are paired together, they’re a formidable team. Laura Dern is also great as Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo. She butts heads with Poe in a big way, but that doesn’t necessarily make her wrong. It’s an interesting dynamic between the two consisting of mutual respect and disagreement. The cast from the classic films also return in fine form. Mark Hamill does a great job with Luke. He’s tragic and sad, but his reluctance to be pulled back into the conflict leads up to some stunning moments later in the story. Carrie Fisher is also great as Leia. It’s a bit sad seeing her on the big screen after her passing, and almost every line she delivers feels like it references that. But she is treated with a lot of respect in the film and she even has some surprising twists along the way. There is also a nice acknowledgement of her in the credits. On the visual effects front, one of the most notable things is Andy Serkis as Supreme Leader Snoke. The CGI for him as astoundingly detailed. You never feel like you’re looking at a CG creation and Serkis really brings him to life. There are also a number of cool creatures in the film besides the aforementioned porgs. There are the crystal foxes called vulptexs which will be fan favorites. There are also the falthiers that are essentially space racehorses on the casino world of Canto Bight. I recommend going into The Last Jedi as spoiler free as possible, but there are a number of surprises in store for you. There are cool cameos, insights into the origins of some characters, and more. And the final scene of the film will leave you with a lump in your throat, a tear in your eye, and ready to see Episode IX. First up, there are some bizarre choices with practical effects. I know it’s fashionable to use practical effects over CGI, but in one crucial scene, the practical effect is so bad it ruins the moment. I won’t get into specifics, but you’ll know it when you see it. In another bizarre choice, we see Luke milking a creature on Ahch-To. And it’s not just like milking a cow. This thing has four human-like breasts and is lounging. They could have maybe made a reference to A New Hope by making it blue milk, but it’s green. I just don’t know what they were thinking with this. There were some unusual character choices, too. Snoke is seen in his hideous glory, but we learn almost nothing about him. He’s an intriguing character, but he is not used to his full potential. Benicio del Toro is also very underutilized as DJ. There were also unusual choices made with Luke and Leia, but I can’t get into it without discussing spoilers. But suffice it to say I wanted to see more of Luke than we ultimately do. Finally, in one scene Rey has a vision much like Luke’s in the cave on Dagobah. But it’s just visually unusual and weird to the point it doesn’t feel quite Star Wars-like. Plot-wise, I felt the entire side story at the casino world of Canto Bight was unnecessary. If you cut the entire sequence out of the film, it would have little impact on the core narrative. And while the plot of the First Order chasing down the resistance fleet was exciting, it felt very much like an episode of Battlestar Galactica entitled “33” where the Cylons doggedly pursued the refugee ships through faster-than-light jumps. It was a little too familiar. Speaking of familiar things, while the battle with the AT-M6 walkers on Crait is exciting, it’s all a little too reminiscent of the battle of Hoth in The Empire Strikes Back. I felt like more effort should have been made to make original vehicles and a unique battle. And some scenes in Snoke’s throne room felt way too similar to those in Return of the Jedi. Matters aren’t helped by the fact that most of John Williams’ score consists of themes from the previous films. I don’t think there was a memorable original theme in The Last Jedi. Overall, The Last Jedi is a very satisfying entry into the Star Wars Saga. It has some fantastic, jaw-dropping moments that you’ll want to see on the big screen with fans. As of this writing, I’ve seen the film twice and there are many new things to discover with each viewing. And I was amazed to see that Rian Johnson foreshadowed a lot of his biggest surprises early in the film. Buy extra tickets. You’re gonna need them."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," That’s not to say “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” will go down in history as a better movie than the franchise’s gold standard, “The Empire Strikes Back,” but director Rian Johnson has pulled off a complete rejuvenation of the saga. The new movie truly passes the torch by making the next generation of Resistance heroes — Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and new addition, Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) — every bit as compelling as the old guard. Even more surprising, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) evolves from the whiny brat in “The Force Awakens” to a three-dimensional menace. As moving as it is to see Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker and the late, great Carrie Fisher’s General Leia back in action, they are no longer the best characters on screen. Without another Death Star to blow up, Johnson is free to navigate a more original plot. The film opens with the Resistance on the losing end of a big battle sequence and fleeing from the pursuing First Order. Across the galaxy, Rey is desperate to convince Luke to pull himself out his self-imposed exile to join the battle against his former protégé, Kylo Ren. It’s not much of a spoiler to reveal that the hero of the original trilogy gets a lot more screen-time than the 30 seconds he notched at the end of the last installment, “The Force Awakens.” Johnson overplays his hand occasionally — most notably an unnecessary sequence at the casino city of Canto Bight that goes straight from a political sermon into a plot hole — but most of his gambles pay off. It’s easy to see why Lucasfilm tapped a director who was previously best known for smaller films like “Brick” and “Looper” for a whole new trilogy. Whereas J.J. Abrams played it relatively safe in 2015’s “The Force Awakens” with a story that paralleled the original “Star Wars” to reinvigorate fans still reeling from the disappointing prequels, “The Last Jedi” is its own bold, fresh spectacle. The handful of flaws blur out of view once the action kicks into hyper-drive. Johnson even found a way to top the cuteness of that fan-favorite, rolling ball of a droid, BB-8. Behold the adorable penguin-like Porg — already the apex predators at the top of toy-shop food chain this holiday season."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," There isn't much to say about this one that hasn't been said or can be said when the film opens in North America on Thursday night, with previews starting at 7 pm. Walt Disney is doing its best to downplay expectations, and I'll help out by arguing that the movie doesn't have to make, and probably won't make, as much as The Force Awakens. There is a ton of kiddie competition this season (Thor, Justice League, Wonder, Coco, Jumanji, Pitch Perfect 3, Ferdinand, etc.) and ""part 2"" Star Wars movies tend to make around 30% less than ""part 1"" Star Wars movies. Sure, they'd love another $200 million+ debut and holiday legs long enough to get it over $700m domestic, but there will be no shame in a mere $650m (or less) presuming paying consumers like the movie as much as critics do. Walt Disney is playing long-ball with this franchise, so the priority is making sure that these movies are good in a way that justifies their relatively regular schedule. That will keep the franchise alive and well for at least the near future, regardless of whether The Last Jedi makes as much in North America ($850 million) as Wolf Warrior 2 did in China. Speaking of which, Disney knows it might not hit the jackpot overseas, making The Last Jedi a rare tentpole movie that is absolutely banking on domestic dollars. Now that's more like it, Ms. Kennedy. After a crowd-pleasing but derivative franchise restarter that introduced interesting new characters but tied them down to previously established templates and an ambitious prequel/spin-off that sold its soul for a crowdpleasing third act, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the real deal. It is one of the best Star Wars movies we've seen thus far, standing alongside The Empire Strikes Back and Revenge of the Sith as a visually dazzling and character-driven spectacle which sets itself apart from the blockbuster pack. It is a long, sprawling and sometimes messy movie about messy conflicts and moral ambiguity in a time of relative immorality. It doesn't always work as intended, and there will be plenty of ""Hey, wait a minute?!"" fodder for the Honest Trailers folks, but it is terrific and intelligent entertainment. After an opening crawl that will have you thinking ""Oh hell, they're remaking The Empire Strikes Back"" (Ron Howard narration: They did not), the movie kicks into gear with a thrilling outer-space dogfight. The opening setpiece, which feels so much like a top-tier 007 curtain raiser that I would almost argue putting the title and crawl afterward, establishes two key points right off the bat. First, this movie is about the fog of war and impossible choices of fighting an overwhelming evil. Second, this movie will blend its peril and desperation with cheerfully silly humor that never gets in the way of the drama or dilutes the stakes. The tone is firmly ""laugh so as not to cry."" And the Resistance has much to weep about, as the First Order's decimation of the Republic has essentially turned them into a ruling party almost overnight. The swiftly crumbling rebellion is on the edge of total annihilation, with Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) at odds with General Leia (Carrie Fisher) about how to best survive and/or fight back.  After a devastating hit shines a light on an Imperial advantage, Poe discreetly sends an awakened Finn (John Boyega) and Resistance engineer Rose Tico (newbie Kelly Marie Tran) on a discreet mission to try to cobble together an on-the-fly solution. But can they save the day in time? Oh, and while this is happening, Rey (Daisy Ridley) has to deal with a very grumpy Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). The Clown Prince of Crime Jedi Master is not pleased to see a new would-be Jedi showing up on his secluded island wielding his old lightsaber and wanting some Force lessons. And he's even less thrilled when he realizes that she is as naturally gifted as his nephew, the one who infamously slaughtered all of his fellow Padawans and burned down the school. Speaking of which, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is dealing with his own issues stemming from killing his own father and then getting his butt kicked by a first-time Force user. Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) doesn't have a ton of confidence in his apprentice, although that may not matter if they succeed in wiping out the Resistance anyway. None of this plot goes past the first act, and that's all you'll get in terms of story info. To Walt Disney's credit, the marketing has been incredibly spoiler-free, more so than even The Force Awakens (which featured a ""not dead yet"" Poe in the very first teaser). So, I'll merely say that there are plenty of exciting incidents and reveals. And Rian Johnson's screenplay is less concerned about ""Oh my god, plot twist!!"" than it is with offering interesting and thoughtful story turns and character development. But yes, for those invested in this mythology and in these characters, there will be plenty of buzzy beats to fuel post-movie conversation. And, perhaps most exciting for fans, the film ends in a way that leaves very little concrete notions about how this portion of the saga will end. Like The Dark Knight, this darker, longer sequel has plenty of moral dissection and tragedy and ends not so much on a cliffhanger but on an interesting new status quo. And like that acclaimed Batman sequel, this one tells an honest-to-goodness genre story encased in a popular franchise. In this case, it's a grim tale of dying resistance fighters trying to light the spark before they are themselves extinguished, that just happens to be a big-budget Star Wars adventure. It is as different from The Force Awakens as The Dark Knight was from Batman Begins (or as Empire was from Star Wars), yet it fits into the established world with grace and aplomb. To a certain extent, The Last Jedi somewhat justifies The Force Awakens' redundancy as a necessary evil to get into the next stage of evolution. We spend plenty of time with our new heroes as they grow, change and/or learn some unpleasant things about themselves. Rey is forced to confront another potentially failed father figure and Finn has to decide if he's a part of the Resistance or merely a stowaway. Laura Dern has a small-but-pivotal role as a Resistance leader, although I wish her and Fisher had more scenes together. Boyega and Tran make a fun odd couple, as their subplot offers a look at those living high on the hog while tyranny reigns while Poe has to deal with the bloody consequences of being a rebellious hotshot. Speaking of which, not only is Tran a wonderful breakout character, the film is filled with ""not a white guy"" characters all over the place. It's noticeable (most of the Resistance upper-management is comprised of older women) and yet feels organic in a way that reaffirms this new Star Wars franchise's legacy as a revamping of what the cast of a megabudget blockbuster can look like. The film pushes its characters in interesting directions in ways that both play off of and openly mock fan theories and/or fanfic. You'll be surprised by what questions and/or answers this sequel is entirely unconcerned about. Hamill successfully blends grave ponderousness with a comedic bitchiness. And yeah, Skywalker finally calls out the Jedi as a futile and outdated cult (they did a bang-up job in the prequels, right?), and one key sequence works as a poignant callback to Revenge of the Sith. His final scenes aren't as successful as they should be, mostly because they are comparatively fan-service-ish, but Hamill is relishing the chance to really act in a major movie for the first time in a very long time. Fisher is fine with her limited screen time, but she's mostly around for the sake of continuity. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a long work of art that doesn't know when to quit (much like this review), but it successfully juggles between being the Rey and Kylo Jedi Show (they are both superb and have interesting arcs) and being a war drama about being on the losing side of a rebellion. It slowly builds to some impressive second-act incidents/reveals as well as offering several splendid actions sequences in the service of a deeply moral and almost altruistic fable. Rian Johnson juggles quite a few characters, and yeah some of them (like Phasma and Hux) get comparatively short-shrift. But since there is at least one more movie with these folks, and at least some of them survive to fight another day, the third film can pick up the slack. Since this is the second chapter in a somewhat stand-alone three-part saga, there is real suspense and tension as essentially every character is expendable. Warts and all, Rian Johnson's Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a terrific Star Wars movie and a fine piece of high-quality popcorn entertainment. It looks gorgeous, boasts strong acting and dazzling action in the service of complex characters and a complex narrative. It balances that line between being escapism and dealing with the inherent horrors of its premise while leaving audiences on edge with absolutely no clue what's going to come next. The Last Jedi is exactly what the franchise needed. It's a top-flight action fantasy that views the Star Wars brand as a responsibility rather than a luxury or a shortcut. It doesn't rest on its laurels or depend on nostalgia and reasserts itself as a franchise of value even in a world of weekly ""event movies"" and big-budget fantasy tentpoles. Star Wars fans will love it, and general moviegoers will find plenty to enjoy. The Last Jedi is not a great movie because it's a Star Wars film. It reasserts Star Wars as a top-tier blockbuster franchise by being a great movie."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"Writer/director Rian Johnson's entry into the Star Wars canon is rebelliously bold at times and full of rousing surprises, which make up for a few lulls in the lengthy two-and-a-half-hour run time."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," When The Force awoke, two long years ago, pretty much the worst thing critics had to say was that it was a beat-for-beat retread of Star Wars, the 1977 original. And they’ll be saying it again of this one. The Last Jedi hearkens back strongly to The Empire Strikes Back; even the opening crawl, which has the rebels in retreat and the First Order on the march, feels very Empire in its design. Later, writer/director Rian Johnson (Looper) will mix in notes from Return of the Jedi, although the final movement will be far less certain. But again, an abundance of nostalgia is about the worst thing you can say about Episode VIII; and a large part of the Gen-X fan base that embraced the original will aver that you can never have enough of that anyway. So here we go again. The forces of goodness and decency are being driven from one planetary redoubt and are looking for another. In pursuit, a trio of baddies. In ascending order of rank, we have General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), whose command of English suggests he owns a special thesaurus with only the evil words; Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), finally convinced to ditch the faux-Vader helmet because he doesn’t actually need it to breathe; and Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), who like the Emperor of old is content to lounge around, surrounded by red-velvet bodyguards, and cackle. The good guys are led by General Leia Organa. She and Carrie Fisher have basically become one and the same, and every moment we see her on the screen is bittersweet, knowing that whatever befalls her in this movie, mortality has dictated she won’t be around for the next. As Yoda would say: Strong is she with the Force … but not that strong. Then there’s Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron, a cocky cockpit jockey whose loose interpretation of the chain of command has Leia uncertain whether to give him a medal or throw him in the brig. (She will basically try each of these at least once, with varying success.) In the opening battle, a real whiz-bang affair, he pulls his X-Wing into a stall in what might be the geekiest/greatest bit of fighter flying in the franchise. Later, he’ll participate in an aerial battle that feels like a Second World War dogfight in which one side is flying First World War aircraft. Leaving aside the technology brings us to Daisy Ridley as Rey, last seen confronting a wizened Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) on a remote island. The film catches up with them at the very same moment. Luke’s first line is – well, let’s just say actions speak louder than words. You’ll have to see the scene to know what I mean. Also, I can report that Chewbacca gets one of the film’s best lines – again, sort of. Anyway, back to Rey. The young warrior holds her own opposite Luke, forcing the old man to become a reluctant guru as she struggles to figure out what this Force thing is and why it flows so strongly in her that she can basically use it to place long-distance collect calls to other Force-sensitives. Equally important, Ridley proves the equal of Hamill in grounding this fantastical world. She believes in his “hokey religion,” and through her, so do we. This leaves John Boyega as Finn, the Stormtrooper-turned-rebel. His character’s storyline is the flabbiest, as he joins forces with a technician named Rose (Kelly Marie Tran, a fantastic addition to the cast) on a mission-within-a-mission that will lead them to a casino planet (every Star Wars movie needs its exotic watering hole), involve a humanitarian sideline, and eventually include treachery and counter-treachery. If The Last Jedi were in need of a trim it would be in this plotline; that said, it does give rise to one of the film’s most beautiful and resonant lines, when Rose tells Finn the secret to victory: “Don’t fight what you hate; save what you love.” Star Wars has always excelled at that; combining cheesy techno-babble – “Horizontal boosters … alluvial dampers … hydro-spanners” – with ungrammatical, vaguely Buddhist-sounding wisdom: “The greatest teacher, failure is.” The Last Jedi continues to balance the mixture perfectly, while increasing the stakes for both sides – we lose some memorable heroes and villains alike before this chapter is closed. If this instalment doesn’t quite deliver the same adrenaline rush as The Force Awakens, that may be because the human body can only take so much of that neurotransmitter at a time. Much as I love the Star Wars galaxy, I fear the day is fast approaching when we reach peak Force. Recall that when the very first movie blasted into our analogue pop cultural consciousness 40 years ago, it would be a full three years before the next hit, not counting the benighted Christmas Special. But in less time we’ve already seen The Force Awakens, Rogue One and The Last Jedi, with the Han Solo movie a mere six months away, a new trilogy from Johnson announced, and rumours of an Obi-Wan trilogy in the works. But again, “too much of a good thing” is such a mild critique you could almost put it on the movie’s poster. The Last Jedi provides a resoundingly positive answer to an old smuggler’s long-ago query: “Let’s see what this piece of junk can do.” This website uses cookies to personalize your content (including ads), and allows us to analyze our traffic.

Join Cultured Vultures as we bring you some of the biggest news from the world of wrestling. Whether it’s WWE news or something from across the sea, let’s talk shop. Star Wars: The Last Jedi may or may not be the best film in the franchise, but what writer-director Rian Johnson has accomplished in the eighth installment of the Skywalker family saga gives hope to the recent announcement of a planned trilogy to come. It goes without saying that one should enter a Star Wars film knowing as little as possible. There are those people who read everything they can about the films going in and those who decide to enter as blindly as possible. Aim for the latter because these new Star Wars films are a treat and Johnson doesn’t let us down. When The Force Awakens concluded, Rey had just met Luke Skywalker and reached out to hand him the lightsaber lost following the battle with Darth Vader in Cloud City. Appropriately enough, Luke Skywalker takes on a larger role in The Last Jedi as Rey seeks to learn the ways of the Force. Whereas The Force Awakens was Han Solo’s film, The Last Jedi is Luke Skywalker’s film. The ninth film, to be helmed by J.J. Abrams, was to be Leia Organa’s film if not for her tragic and untimely passing. Filmmakers were wise to not reveal so much in the trailers and TV spots–nobody wants to see the film be completely spoiled. Seeing Skywalker deliver the “it’s time for the Jedi to end” line is understood further in context on the big screen. This is the thing with not revealing much in trailers — it leaves a lot left to be uncovered and fans are able to truly experience a film. In watching The Last Jedi, there’s a lot of sadness in knowing it’s the final on-screen appearance of Carrie Fisher in one of the most iconic roles for women. The film serves as a proper goodbye for General Organa with both new and old characters getting to say a goodbye to her in that respect. Fisher has served the role well and will truly be missed. For Rey (Daisy Ridley), Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), Finn (John Boyega), and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), The Last Jedi offers a chance to develop their characters further and in some instances, go into their backstory. What Johnson is able to do with these characters overall leaves one wanting more of them after the film ends — the best part is knowing it won’t be another three years before they return on screen given the two years of waiting in between the films. There wasn’t much of Dameron to be seen in The Force Awakens, but fans should expect to be satisfied by how much he has to do this time around. As far as Rey and Kylo go, there’s a lot to be said in the growth of their characters with the Force. There’s also a lot that can’t be said about the two because it would get into spoiler territory and let’s be honest, nobody wants that. After two films in the new trilogy, a betting person would likely describe this trio of films as telling the story of Rey and Kylo. Rey was already seen as a kick-ass action hero, a role model for girls and young women everywhere, and The Last Jedi further cements that. She’s the heir apparent to Leia Organa in this regard. Adam Driver was made to play Kylo and his performance is even better this time around — he was made for Star Wars. The series belongs to them inasmuch as it does the previous generation. It wouldn’t be a Star Wars film without a lightsaber battle and The Last Jedi has not one but two of them. The battle scenes, be it on the ground or in space, make for some spectacular visuals including one of the best this year. For everything that has been said about George Lucas’ inability to write dialogue and whatnot in favor of visual effects, this problem has been righted in the new trilogy, which Lucas hasn’t been involved with at all. Whether anything Lucas suggested was considered as they plotted the course of the new trilogy is unknown, but it’s clear from the get-go that both Abrams and Johnson have a vision for where they want to take the franchise. When all is said and done, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the greatest Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back. Without having to worry about so many character introductions, the film goes right into the action and 2.5 hours later, fans will be clamoring for more.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," How much you enjoy “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” may hinge on how seriously you take this franchise, and that’s good news for those of us who are casual users and not religious adherents. Writer-director Rian Johnson steps into this ongoing saga with an eye seemingly more aimed at the “Flash Gordon” serials that originally inspired George Lucas than at the terminal self-seriousness that so many fans inflict upon the material. If having pure fun at a “Star Wars” movie is wrong, I don’t want to be right. So for me, “The Last Jedi” falls right behind “The Empire Strikes Back” and maybe the original film in providing the thrills and the heartbreak, the heroism and villainy, and the romance and betrayal that makes these films such a treat even for those of us who can’t name all the planets or the alien species or even the Empire’s flunkies. (Sorry, the First Order’s flunkies.) And make no mistake: This is an entertaining chapter, but it also features loss and sacrifice and devastating consequences. Johnson skillfully balances quite a few characters, all operating at various points of the universe, and he and editor Bob Ducsay (“San Andreas”) weave between them without losing the thread. At 150 minutes — the longest “Star Wars” movie yet — the pace never drags, but even all that real estate doesn’t allow for the inclusion of all the characters we’ve come to know by this point. (Make sure not to blink, fans of Lupita Nyong’o‘s Maz Kanata.) We pick up where “The Force Awakens” finished, with Rey (Daisy Ridley), Chewbacca (now performed by Joonas Suotamo) and R2D2 finding Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in self-imposed exile. Rey wants to be trained in the ways of the Jedi, but after Luke’s experiences in trying to be a master to Ben Solo, aka Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), he would prefer to leave his past behind him. Meanwhile, the First Order, under the command of General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), has tracked down the last remaining rebel base, but General Leia (the late Carrie Fisher) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) aren’t giving up without a fight. Part of battling the First Order’s attack relies upon a secret mission being undertaken by reformed stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) and maintenance worker Rose (series newcomer Kelly Marie Tran). And while Rey works to get Luke to mentor her progress, she finds herself surprisingly linked to someone else, in a mental and perhaps spiritual bond that could change the very nature of the conflict. At one point, Kylo yells, “Forget the Jedi! Forget the Sith! Forget the First Order!” in the hopes of forging something entirely new, and while it’s tempting to think that the “Star Wars” films could ever actually do such a thing, Johnson at least succeeds at making the personal stakes matter as much as the intergalactic ones do. And while a few scenes may ring familiar — instead of Luke seeking training from Yoda, Rey seeks it from Luke; instead of a scuzzy cantina, Finn and Rose visit a swanky, Monte-Carlo-in-outer-space casino — the accusations of “The Force Awakens” being a redo of the original “Star Wars” (yes, yes, “A New Hope,” whatever) can’t be leveled here. The cast is certainly game, from the veterans to additions like Laura Dern, but it’s very often Fisher’s show, and not merely for the sentimental baggage we can’t help bringing with us into the theater. Leia has rarely gotten this much to do in these movies, and here she’s not only capable of extraordinary feats (the Force is strong with this one) but she’s also as wry as we knew the actress to be off-camera. If there’s a bum note here, it’s the introduction of Rose: it’s certainly praiseworthy for the Skywalker saga to include such a prominent Asian character — particularly since Kurosawa’s “The Hidden Fortress” was such a key influence — but she’s shamelessly a fan avatar. Her introductory scene involves her getting all gushy over meeting Finn for the first time (although she promptly tases him when she realizes he’s trying to hijack an escape pod), and later, the script uses her mainly as a plot convenience. If she sticks around, here’s hoping she’s given some more layers. Visually, “The Last Jedi” is a feast. There’s a reason why the color red is so prominently featured in the posters, from the faceless Spanish Inquisition-esque guards for Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) to a planet where a layer of snow covers a surface of crimson salt, leading to a spectacular climactic ground battle. We’re also introduced to a fascinating menagerie of new creatures, including premature fan favorites, the Porgs. In his best previous films, Johnson has demonstrated an ability never to let his art get in the way of his genre pleasures, and once again he’s crafted a good-looking movie that ultimately serves both the characters and the sensations. (Not that there aren’t ideas to be found here — that casino is loaded with people who got rich off the arms trade, and Finn is taken aback to discover that the same merchants who sell TIE fighters to the First Order are also profiting off X-wings for the rebels. In war, no one’s hands are clean.) This is button-pushing at its finest, the kind of manipulation so skillful that you don’t even mind being manipulated. As “Star Wars” changes hands from the old guard to the new, the series remains the gold standard of mass-market popcorn thrills."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"Optimistically, The Last Jedi leaves plenty of intriguing possibilities for the climactic installment. But there's also the kind of room for improvement that remind us when it comes to Star Wars, such hopes -- new or otherwise -- spring eternal."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"More than anyone else on screen, Driver seems to know exactly how to pitch his character. He is magnetic in his scenes, and his sequences sing with (space) operatic melodrama that, for all its showiness, is absolutely correct for the piece."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Let’s get to the answer every Star Wars fan is dying to know: Porgs are indeed adorable and there are just enough of them in The Last Jedi. Oh, wait, you were more interested in the parentage of Daisy Ridley’s heroine Rey, what Mark Hamill’s Jedi master Luke Skywalker has been doing on an island for years, and why Adam Driver's menacing Kylo Ren is constantly miffed? The eighth and latest chapter in the long-running space opera dives into those mysteries from The Force Awakens, too. In fact, The Last Jedi (***½ out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters Thursday night) tries to do a little too much in its overlong 2½ hours, yet writer/director Rian Johnson still turns in a stellar entry that owes much to George Lucas’ original films while finding a signature vibe of its own and unleashing a few welcome twists. Two different paths are taken for our returning heroes, starting with the Force Awakens fallout for the upstart Resistance: Hotshot pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and his crew blew up the evil First Order’s Starkiller Base but quickly figure out how overmatched they are when the bad guys rebound with a full-scale assault. It becomes a race for survival from there for a fleet led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), and one that gets dicier when they meet up with new leader Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern), who immediately butts heads with Poe. The First Order’s Supreme Leader Snoke (a CGI baddie played by Andy Serkis) gets into the fray, and former Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) and new Resistance mechanic Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) get their own undercover mission to help foil the enemy’s annihilation plans. Meanwhile across the universe, Rey finds Luke in self-imposed exile and tries to convince him to come back and help turn the tide against the First Order. Once a farm boy and now a curmudgeon, Luke balks but finally gives Rey a crash course in the Force, as the penguin-like porgs chortle around them, and reveals his own tragic backstory with villainous nephew Kylo. Naturally, everybody’s subplots come together for a couple of major-league cosmic throwdowns and a lot of fun character moments for all. Isaac gets the Han Solo Memorial Award for wearing the flyboy-with-attitude role so well, the late Fisher shines as brightly as she did in the original films, and though Ridley and Hamill never quite click, she and Driver are fantastic together. The Last Jedi is Driver’s to rule as much as Force Awakens was Ridley’s, and he’s awesome in it — Kylo is blockbuster cinema’s most magnetic and unpredictable antagonist since Heath Ledger’s Dark Knight Joker. Just as good is the original Star Wars hero: Hamill lends gravitas, warmth, power and even humility to old Luke in a memorable performance. Johnson goes a little rogue from past filmmakers by infusing Last Jedi with more modern hilarity and occasional quirkiness than you'd find in your normal Star Wars. (Though it works better here than in, say, Thor: Ragnarok.) There's no denying his obvious Star Wars love, though. In addition to including unexpected goosebump-inducing callbacks, the director takes time to deconstruct certain aspects of franchise lore that before now probably just existed on a Reddit board. Johnson also adds new wrinkles to the mystical Force, some of which work while others might polarize purists. The sacrifices all pack a gut punch, the space battles and action scenes are killer — one battle featuring Driver and Ridley is a Star Wars all-timer — but the momentum suffers when The Last Jedi's zippy pace downshifts. Its overstuffed length will test the resolve, though come on: We’re already counting down till Episode IX."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi is striking, stunning, visually hypnotizing, thrilling - everything ""epic"" about the famed franchise rolled into a tremendously overcharged start to Rian Johnson's Star Wars career."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," So, before we talk about The Last Jedi, let’s talk about The Empire Strikes Back for just a moment. Have you ever tried to describe the plot of The Empire Strikes Back to anyone? Using just a couple of sentences, it always sounds like a terrible movie. Now, the original Star Wars sounds fun: “A small group of freedom fighters comes together to destroy the evil Empire’s ultimate weapon.” But The Empire Strikes Back sounds more like this: “The evil Empire discovers where the Rebels are hiding, the Rebels all fly away in different directions.” The Empire Strikes Back doesn’t have a traditional plot, which is why it earned the most tepid reviews of the original three movies upon its initial release in 1980. Of course, time has been kind to The Empire Strikes Back, often now considered the best Star Wars movie made, even surpassing the original. It’s a movie that focuses on character development instead of plot. It’s the movie where we really get to know what drives Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, Han Solo and Darth Vader. Considering his past work, it shouldn’t be a huge surprise to learn that director Rian Johnson uses the Empire template for The Last Jedi. The nice thing that comes with using The Empire Strikes Back as a starting point is that a movie can basically do anything. This isn’t like The Force Awakens, which uses a lot of the same plot points from the original Star Wars. Instead, it puts our heroes in jeopardy the whole movie – a relentless two and a half hours of tension – separates them, and explores who they are and what they’re fighting for. Like Empire, our big three – now Rey, Finn and Poe – do not spend a lot of time together on screen, which of course just makes us want to see them all somehow reunite. There were events in The Force Awakens that would be considered massive spoilers, most notably the fate of Han Solo. J.J. Abrams is notorious for keeping secrets, to a fault. But it’s kind of telling for a couple of reasons that the plot of The Force Awakens was pretty much everywhere months before the movie came out, yet now we have the comparative openness of Rian Johnson’s movie – I mean, the guy is always on Twitter answering questions – and yet few plot details leaked in advance. Princess Leia in the first Star Wars was right, “The more you tighten your grip, the more spoilers will slip through your fingers.” (That might not be a 100 percent accurate quote.) But the other thing is, there are just not a lot of things to spoil in The Last Jedi. I mean, yes, there are a couple, but there are no big, capital P, plot points to even relay. The Last Jedi is a character study. The Last Jedi picks up mere moments after the events of The Force Awakens. Emboldened by the destruction of the Republic’s home planet in the prior film, the First Order – led by Snoke (Andy Serkis), Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and General Hux (Domhnall Gleason, hamming it up even more than he did in the last movie) – mounts an all-out attack on the Resistance’s secret base as the Resistance – led by Leia (Carrie Fisher, in her last performance, and it’s a great one) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) – tries to evacuate. Finn (John Boyega) teams up with Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), a Resistance maintenance worker, on a mission that takes them to a beautiful casino planet where they meet a code breaker played by Benicio del Toro (basically the Lando of this movie). Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley) is still on the remote planet of Ahch-To, trying to convince Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) that she’s worthy to be trained in the ways of the force. (See, I told you an Empire template is being used here.) This is literally almost the entire plot of The Last Jedi. But, again, “plot” is not what The Last Jedi is going for. What’s important in The Last Jedi is what happens to, and what we find out about, all of these characters along the way. In retrospect, The Force Awakens feels like a short introduction to these characters. After The Last Jedi, I feel like I’ve gone on a week-long road trip with them all. I suspect, once the dust settles, The Last Jedi might be divisive – at least in the way that Empire was in that it doesn’t follow the traditional structure of a Star Wars movie. Where The Force Awakens felt like a movie by committee, The Last Jedi really does feel like one person’s vision of what a Star Wars movie should be. It doesn’t tick off the corporate studio boxes that are surefire, go to “crowd pleasers” (even though there are many crowd-pleasing moments). In a lot of ways, The Last Jedi is a weird movie. And I’m sure the word “dark” will be thrown around, but it’s not “dark.” Just like The Empire Strikes Back isn’t “dark.” Now, A Serbian Film, that’s a dark movie. The Empire Strikes Back and The Last Jedi are both well-made Star Wars movies with a lot of humor, where also some bad things happen to characters we like. In fact, The Last Jedi is so funny at times, I could also see that element being divisive. But people forget how funny the original trilogy actually is. In Empire, Han Solo and C-3PO are basically doing a vaudeville routine.

(This is a complaint for another time, but The Last Jedi continues the trend of not knowing what to do with C-3PO and R2-D2. Even back in the ‘80s, George Lucas said that the two droids would be the through-line of all the different movies – the only characters to appear in them all. And technically that’s true, but they are such an integral part of the original trilogy – they actually contributed to the plot – yet ever since The Phantom Menace, their presence feels more like extended cameos.) In The Last Jedi, there’s a continuing theme of destroying what came before to make room for something new. This could be taken a lot of ways, especially since Kylo Ren is the one in favor of this idea. It’s a movie about change and regret and getting older, but also about hope for what’s to come. (Though, part of me likes to think that destroying what came before is in direct reference to the aspects of The Force Awakens that Johnson didn’t like, because there are a few key aspects of that movie that Johnson smashes into oblivion. I look forward to Abrams trying to bring them all back in the next movie anyway.) I’ll keep this short, but, personally, this has literally been the shittiest time of my life. After losing my father, suddenly, a little over three weeks ago, it’s been a pretty much non-stop barrage of hurt. My father took me to see The Empire Strikes Back in 1980, my first movie. He took me to the Star Wars re-release in 1981. It was surprisingly tough to watch a new Star Wars movie this soon after, at least a lot harder than I thought it would be. But something else happened: I felt emotions that weren’t “absolute shit” for the first time in three weeks. For two and a half hours, I really did feel like I got to visit that galaxy far, far away – and good God I needed to go there. That’s the magic these movies can have. I am not someone who cries during new Star Wars movies because a character I like shows up, or whatever, but I sure did during this one. And for the first time since this all happened, that cry felt good."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," In fact, there are hardly any surprises at all. The movie is filled with soon-to-be iconic moments that look great on posters, make trailers pop, sound like mantras and doubtless will lead to ovations in crowded theaters. But you can see almost all of them coming, if not a mile away, then at least well enough in advance to say, “Oh, so that’s what’s going to happen.” There are some big twists, no doubt. But not many shocks. And if you sense disappointment in that assessment, that’s vague, too. “The Last Jedi” is a fun movie, and writer and director Rian Johnson (“Looper,” “Brick” and “Ozymandias,” one of the great episodes of “Breaking Bad”) hasn’t made a rehash of “The Empire Strikes Back,” thankfully. (The big strike against J.J. Abrams’ “The Force Awakens” was that it was basically a remake of “Star Wars,” the first film, only with cooler special effects.) Johnson charts his own course. You’ll recall from Abrams’ film that Rey (Daisy Ridley), in whom the Force is strong, caught up with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), self-exiled on a remote island. The Resistance, led by General Leia (Carrie Fisher), needs his help to fight off the First Order, the new bad guys who are quite similar to the old ones. Meanwhile, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), the petulant son of Han Solo and Leia, is nursing wounds both physical, courtesy of a light-saber battle with Rey, and emotional, after killing his father. Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), who in this film isn’t just a hologram but a physical presence, is disappointed.  Basically it boils down to, c’mon man, if you can’t snuff out all hope in the universe, what good are you? Meanwhile meanwhile, Finn (John Boyega), injured in the last film, recovers quickly but isn’t thrilled about his odds of survival on the Resistance ship he’s on. Meanwhile meanwhile meanwhile Poe (Oscar Isaac) is proving be a hot-headed flyboy intent on fighting first and cleaning up the mess later. That’s a lot of meanwhiles. And it’s not even all of them. At times when something interesting gets going with Kylo or Luke, we switch back to Finn and it’s like, oh yeah, that’s going on, too. But the big dilemma, at least in terms of the main story, is that the First Order has figured out how to follow ships through hyperspace. Circumstances dictate that Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo (Laura Dern) take command, and Poe falls in with a plan hatched by Finn and his new friend Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) to foil the technology that allows for the tracking. The bad news is, this involves an unnecessary trip to a kind of casino planet that doesn’t really advance the story. The good news is, it involves Benicio Del Toro, who is terrific as DJ, a code-cracker and all-around hooligan. It’s also nice to see Domhnall Gleeson back as General Hux, who tries to be a good bad guy but is basically the Wile E. Coyote of the story. That’s OK, actually. This film has a lot of humor, and it’s welcome. You can only sit around talking about the Force that binds everything in the universe for so long without something funny happening. (Driver is particularly good at the comedic sidelong glance, completely incongruous for a would-be evil lord but perfect for the moment. He remains my favorite part of the new batch of “Star Wars” movies.) Johnson remains true to the spirit of the “Star Wars” legacy, without question. Like the others, this film tackles the basics of good vs. evil, although who takes which side remains fluid. And Johnson is to be lauded for not locking himself into a retelling of the same old story. While there is plenty of familiarity — this franchise basically demands it — he isn’t afraid to go in new directions. But while “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” is a good movie and a worthy entry, it would have been stronger if Johnson didn’t telegraph those new directions before leading us to them. Release Date: Dec. 15, original U.S. release date. Advance screenings available via fan fest events Dec. 14. The film premiered in Los Angeles on Dec. 9. "
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"  I know many of you are worried about spoilers. This review will be very light on them to preserve the experience of seeing Star Wars: The Last Jedi for the first time. But let's begin with what you really want to know: Star Wars: The Last Jedi is awesome. I laughed. I cried. I screamed and cheered so much that my throat went raw, and I left the theater on a high of exhilaration.   The Last Jedi picks up right where The Force Awakens left off. Rey (Daisy Ridley) has sought out Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in hopes of turning the tide of the Resistance's war against the Empire and Supreme Leader Snokes (Andy Serkis). Meanwhile, General Leia (Carrie Fisher) and her forces are on the run from General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) gets plenty of dashing screentime in this thread, and Finn (John Boyega) awakens from his coma in time for a side-quest with a courageous maintenance worker named Rose (Kelly Marie Tran). Other colorful new characters are portrayed by Laura Dern, who is radiant, and Benicio Del Toro, whose signature quirk was born to be in a Star Wars movie.   Writer/director Rian Johnson was handed the keys to the one of the coolest franchises in cinema history, and he's made an epic adventure destined to have fans exultant. The screenplay shows a great care for the saga's longest-running characters, meaning Luke and Leia feel wonderfully familiar, yet never stale. In her final Star Wars performance, the late Fisher is fiery as ever, yet regal, and all around glorious, whether she's smirking at headstrong Poe or urging her fellow rebels to dare to hope. Meanwhile, Hamill's long-awaited return to the franchise is suitably spiked with bravado, pathos, humor and the smug smile that makes a cameo at the best possible moment.   Those who grumbled over The Force Awakens feeling structurally like a New Hope reboot will be happy to learn Johnson's no longer retreading or playing it safe. The Last Jedi expands the cinematic world of Star Wars, introducing a telling new location. More crucially, he answers a big question fans have been asking since the introduction of Rey. With both, he has cracked open a brave new path for this franchise that I'm sure you'll see plenty of speculation pieces about in the coming weeks.   Johnson seems to have devotedly studied the response to The Force Awakens, for there's great care in crafting the continued stories of Rey, Kylo, Finn and Poe. It's not only their courage that is tested, but their hope, vanity and motivations, urging each to pivotal realizations. Johnson offers some fun fan service as well, giving a winking scene to Poe/Finn shippers, and plenty of fuel for Rey/Kylo shippers. Basically, The Last Jedi is exploding with moments that will have fans cheering and squeeing.   The new wave of Star Wars stars is divine. Wielding her staff or a lightsaber, Ridley is stalwart and inspiring. In moments of inner conflict, she is vulnerable and riveting. Driver pushes the wrathful Kylo to new corners of angst and ambition, and lights up the screen with the fire in his eyes. Boyega is once more a winsome wonder, bounding about the galaxy with a boyish charm. And Isaac is once more a delicious blend of cocky, sexy and funny, offering new depth as his roguish rebel pilot learns a hard lesson in heroism.   Johnson's savvy writing does right by the characters we love, and pushes them to new places, both thrilling and disturbing. The performances of a sprawling and compelling cast make each moment sing, and John Williams' bombastic, classic themes make our pulses race to their rhythm. That Johnson has delivered breathtaking action sequences on top of all this means The Last Jedi is true to the very best of the Star Wars legacy.   There's a special magic when you're seated in a movie theater packed with an audience giddy to experience a film. There's a sense of joyful reverence in the air, and through watching the film, you become one. Together you gasp. Together you cheer. Together, you drop jaws at the wonders spilling forth before you. As a critic, I go to a lot of movies, and this sort of cathartic community experience is rare. But I felt it at Star Wars: The Last Jedi, where the audience throbbed as if we shared the same heartbeat.   Every action sequence in this movie is outstanding, from the opening spaceship battle, to a beautifully choreographed Kylo/Rey fight, and the spectacular ground war on a planet where kicked up dirt looks like sprays of blood. (It's very a clever way to get the impact of gore without incurring the censorship of the dreaded MPAA!) But there's a single moment where Johnson knows he has you in the palm of his hand. As it plays out, the sound drops out. Gone are the sound effects of lasers and tearing metal. Gone is the cry of our beloved characters. Gone is John Williams' booming score. It's silence on screen, and all you'll hear are the gasps and whimpers of the audience around you, awed by the majesty before them.   Last night once I walked out of the screening, someone dared me to find a fault in The Last Jedi. I'm sure they exist. No movie is truly perfect. But this morning, as I reflect on what I witnessed, I am only in awe.  The Star Wars saga continues as new heroes and galactic legends go on an epic adventure, unlocking mysteries of the Force and shocking revelations of the past.  Written and directed by Rian Johnson, Star Wars: The Last Jedi hits theaters December 15 and stars Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Daisy Ridley as Rey, John Boyega as Finn, Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron, Andy Serkis as Supreme Leader Snoke, Domhnall Gleeson as General Hux, Gwendoline Christie as Captain Phasma, Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, Lupita Nyong’o as Maz Kanata, Benicio Del Toro as ‘DJ’, Kelly Marie Tran as Rose Tico, Laura Dern as Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, and the late Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa. "
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"One of the strongest aspects of The Last Jedi is its writing. Written and directed by Rian Johnson, he shakes the foundations of The Force and puts everything we think we know to the test."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Evil is ascendant. The Resistance — an intrepid, multi-everything group whose leaders include a battle-tested woman warrior — has been fighting the good fight for years but is outnumbered and occasionally outmaneuvered. Yes, the latest “Star Wars” installment is here, and, lo, it is a satisfying, at times transporting entertainment. Remarkably, it has visual wit and a human touch, no small achievement for a seemingly indestructible machine that revved up 40 years ago and shows no signs of sputtering out (ever). “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” picks up where the story left off two years ago in “The Force Awakens,” the leadoff of the series’ newest trilogy. Keeping track of where each “Star Wars” title fits into the overall scheme of things can be brain-numbing (the movies weren’t made in story-chronological order), but the strongest ones work as stand-alones and let you just go with the onscreen flow. The writer-director of “The Last Jedi,” Rian Johnson, frontloads the critical back story intel — who’s fighting who and the like — in the opening crawl. And then he gets down to the difficult business of putting his fingerprints on a franchise that deliberately resists individual authorship. Hey, this is Rian Johnson. I wrote and directed “Star Wars: The Last Jedi.” So this is the Battle of Crait, which is the big battle at the end of the movie. And here, we wanted to make these craft that they’re in, these ski speeders, as rickety as possible. Everything from the sound design to the way ILM animated them — you can just see everything is wobbling on these things, even having the open canopy so our heroes feel very exposed. And you just want to feel like this is David versus Goliath. Even them falling apart, this little gag here, just feeling like, what are they doing? They’re in basically rolling lawnmowers going up against these massive tanks. Bob Ducsay, our editor, cut together this little Star Wars-y montage, which I love so much. It just feels like our brave heroes going into battle. And then I love this moment with Kelly. It’s so relatable. It’s a big, heroic moment, but you see she’s scared. And then you see that she takes some strength and goes into battle. So this is all about geography, this big pan here, establishing very clearly the two lines of battle and establishing the door right there that’s the objective. And that’s why we do these camera moves that are very wide-angle lenses and very clearly show you the layout of everything — so that when we get into the battle here, when the fighters come and you see, once again, our heroes don’t have a chance, it’s like hawks versus mice, we can just go nuts and get into the fun of the red and the white. The red and white landscape — originally it was something I came up with because in a PG-13 Star Wars movie, you can’t really show the violence of a battle. You can’t show blood. And the idea of the landscape expressing that violence in a very bold, graphic way was something I thought could be interesting. Mr. Johnson largely succeeds despite having inherited an elaborate ecosystem with a Manichaean worldview divided between heroes (a.k.a. the Resistance) and villains (the First Order). That’s about all you need to know to follow this movie, which charts the franchise’s future while continuing to pass the baton from its first holy trinity — Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill — to a new trio, introduced in “The Force Awakens.” Mr. Ford’s character, Han Solo, exited the series in that movie. As Leia, Ms. Fisher plays a critical role in this new one, but her death last December (after production ended) imparts real melancholy to a series that from its start has been defined — if not always comfortably — by loss. And so, once upon a time yet again, peace remains elusive and weapons are locked, loaded and often firing. Here, the fight continues with Leia searching for her absent brother, Luke Skywalker (Mr. Hamill), while leading the Resistance against the First Order, the dark-side successor to the dictatorial Empire (Darth Vader’s cohort). The old Imperial evildoers have been replaced by the suitably cartoonish-sounding Snoke (created by the hard-working Andy Serkis and digital effects), a wormy, towering ghoul with vivid scars and an insinuating sneer. He commands the usual stormtroopers along with the impetuous Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), a charismatic villain who has closely fashioned himself after Vader.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac return for 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi,' the Rian Johnson-directed second film in the 'Star Wars' sequel trilogy. Back on terra firma or, to be specific, the thrusting oceanic mountain hideaway so splendidly represented by Skellig Michael, Rey finds Luke in a singularly depressive state, ready to call it a day where Jedi and the force are concerned. For him, it’s all over, and Rey has her work cut out for her getting Luke to change his mind. Hardcore series devotees will decide to what extent the new film functions in an equivalent way to how The Empire Strikes Back did in the initial trilogy in 1980. But what it definitely does is stir the pot with ambivalence on both sides of the good-and-evil equation: Just as Luke is ready to pack it in as far as perpetuating the Jedi tradition is concerned, so does Kylo Ren begin to question his abandonment of his true legacy; the tables keep turning here, which is desirable from the dramatic point of view of sustaining fan excitement about what’s in store two years from now and beyond. Johnson, whose three indie-slanted prior features — Brick, The Brothers Bloom and Looper — are all crime tales tinged with offbeat humor, is faced with at least two major narrative challenges: to advance the renewed face-off between the resurgent First Order and the beleaguered Resistance and to further develop the characters introduced two years ago. As for the one who counts, Kylo Ren, it remains difficult to accept Driver physically as the son of Ford and Fisher (unless there’s a surprise parentage revelation yet to come, which could make for a good joke), although the character’s complexities begin emerging in interesting ways that promise even more surprises in two years’ time, when J.J. Abrams’ third chapter to this yarn, the still-untitled Star Wars: Episode IX, will land. More crucial is building up audience interest in and sympathy for the new banner carriers for the Resistance, and the results remain mixed. As bold soldier Finn, John Boyega made a big splash two years ago, but his character more or less treads water here; he’s reduced to more generic athletics. An adventure he shares with a new character, maintenance worker Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), isn’t one of the most compelling interludes of the film’s 162 minutes. Lupita Nyong’o is in again briefly as the leather-skinned-looking old pirate Maz Kamata. Towering Gwendoline Christie, so wonderful in Game of Thrones, is, ironically, hard to spot. At this stage, Poe has his hands full not only with the First Order’s warriors but with a disconcerting new character who has parachuted into the story. Laura Dern’s Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo is a lavender-haired, oddly accoutered contemporary of Leia who turns up ostensibly to help the Resistance. But she has an odd way of speaking, doesn’t like “trigger-happy fly-boy” Poe at all and is so negative about every proposal made to thwart the enemy that one might imagine she’s working for the other team. Time will no doubt tell what her game is, but one shares Poe’s apprehensions. Mixed in with these emotions is the poignance attached to Fisher’s death a year ago toward the end of production. Enlivening things in a more positive way is a blaggard named DJ played with great mischief by Benicio del Toro, who sneaks and slithers around and plays all sides like an unusually active lizard. Narratively, Johnson has a tendency to create digressions within digressions, not that there’s anything necessarily wrong with that as long as you’re skilled enough to keep multiple balls in the air, which he mostly is. The humor does at times strike notes unusual for the franchise, more often to the good than bad, and John Williams’ vigorous eighth Star Wars franchise score never sounds rote or tiresomely familiar. Maybe the film is a tad too long. Most of the new characters could use more heft, purpose and edge to their personalities, and they have a tendency to turn up hither and yon without much of a clue how they got there; drawing a geographical map of their movements would create an impenetrable network of lines. But there’s a pervasive freshness and enthusiasm to Johnson’s approach that keeps the pic, and with it the franchise, alive, and that is no doubt what matters most."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"This is the first Star Wars movie made by an artist instead of a craftsman, and it leaves us on the verge of something new. I'm very, very excited to see what that might be."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Take the famous opening crawl, which begins with, “A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away …,” followed by the episode number and a nifty, three-paragraph summary of where we are and what has just happened. Or the glorious score, which hits just the right inspirational notes when our heroes are swooping in and doing those things heroes do — and sends a chill down our spine with the booming sounds of doom when we join a slimy general aboard his ship, or a menacing Darth, helmeted or otherwise. Even the costumes and the creatures and the makeup are dead giveaways. Our droids are cute little garbage cans that make beep-boop sounds; their droid sports more black than an Oakland Raiders fan in mourning. This is one of the many, many, MANY reasons the “Star Wars” franchise has enjoyed such worldwide, generation-spanning appeal for 40 years and counting. The universe of the movies (and all the ancillary products) is vast and complex and brimming with hundreds of characters and deep philosophical issues — but your 6-year-old can also dig it because at heart this is a Space Western, with timeless heroes and hiss-worthy villains. “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” is the eighth film in the main canon — the second film in the modern trilogy that kicked off with the rousing and powerfully moving “The Force Awakens” in 2015. Although it doesn’t pack quite the same emotional punch and it lags a bit in the second half, this is still a worthy chapter in the “Star Wars” franchise, popping with exciting action sequences, sprinkled with good humor and containing more than a few nifty “callbacks” to previous characters and iconic moments. We pick up the saga in the immediate aftermath of “The Force Awakens.” The diminished and seemingly hopelessly outmatched Resistance is doing battle with the all-powerful and relentless First Order. (Carrie Fisher’s Gen. Leia Organa is still the leader of the Resistance, and your heart can’t help but skip a beat the first time the late Ms. Fisher appears onscreen. The performance she delivers, on its own, is subtle and wise and quietly powerful.) Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley) has tracked down Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill, and if I have to put “Mark Hamill” in parentheses next to the name “Luke Skywalker” in a review, welcome back from your 40-year coma!), whose initial reaction to Rey’s visit is hilarious and comes at just the right time when we need a little levity. (Writer-director Rian Johnson displays keen instincts for dropping in some terrific one-liners and a couple of killer visual gags, in effect giving the audience permission to stop holding its breath and exhale for a moment. Well done.) Andy Serkis, aka the King of the CGI Characters, is wonderfully menacing as the frightening Supreme Leader Snoke, while the do-everything Domhnall Gleason is suitably slimy and slithering as Gen. Hux. And then there’s Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren, formerly known as Ben Solo, last seen completely giving himself to the dark side of the Force — or has he? There’s an undeniable, cosmic connection between Rey and Kylo, and she believes he can be saved. (Adam Driver is a fine actor, but I still think he’s slightly miscast as Kylo Ren. There’s something very 21st century about Driver’s mannerisms, his speech pattern, even his slightly pigeon-toed millennial gait, that has me less than sold when things get extra-heavy and even borderline corny.) John Boyega returns as Finn, the Stormtrooper who is still transitioning to full-out rebel but his well on his way. Kelly Marie Tran adds grit and warmth as Rose Tico, who starts the journey as something of a fan-girl but finds her inner heroine when the time comes. Benicio del Toro is perfectly cast as a disheveled figure with hidden talents and unclear loyalties. With a running time of two and a half hours, “The Last Jedi” drags a bit in the second act, as we cut back and forth from Rey’s efforts to get Luke to rejoin the battle, and the fireworks between the First Order and the Resistance. Ridley and Hamill are great together, but the Reluctant Jedi act plays on for at least once scene too many. Still, this is no mere placeholder of a story. Huge, important things happen to characters secondary and primary. Surprises big and small abound. As is the case with all of the “Star Wars” films, where there is evil there is heroism, and where there is bravery there is sacrifice — and sometimes where there is love, there is heartbreak. That’s the way things were a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, and that’s the way things are today — and that’s another reason why we love these movies."
"Dec 12, 2017",NEUTRAL," Let us begin on a merry note. Unequivocally justifying the decision to bring Star Wars to Skellig Michael, that outcrop's performance outclasses those by many other, more metaphorical piles of inexpressive stone in this often-underwhelming eighth episode. It is all over the film. So, you need prepare no terrible puns for complaints to The Irish Times letters page. The film-makers have noticed the puffins and, in their honour, created the adorable porgs – orange and white semi-birds – to charm Chewbacca and provide yet more merchandising opportunities. We see it in gloom. We see it from within. We note that the Millennium Falcon has covered parts of it. Go, Star Wars Island. What goes on there, however, exemplifies what's wrong with the surrounding superstructure. As you will recall from the last part, Rey (Daisy Ridley) has arrived on the damp planet Ahch-To intent on luring Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) back into the action. His very first reaction takes in an excellent joke that (along with an adjacent one involving Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac) suggests Star Wars may be prepared to take the intergalactic Mickey out of itself. Not so much. For the first half of a punishingly long film, we repeatedly cut back to Star Wars Island where Rey is begging Luke to train her as a Jedi. He speaks in the sort of self-help baloney that Harrison Ford famously described as ""sh*t"" to George Lucas. Rey's allusions to family mysteries remind us that many Star Wars episodes could be comfortably retitled: ""Who's your Daddy?"" The Force is explored with a po-faced solemnity that few films now bring to the investigation of any genuine belief systems. It's more boring than being in church. Put simply, The Last Jedi is lodged several parsecs up its own black hole. George Lucas's Star Wars (that's what the film was called) was awash with influences from myth, legend and cheap space opera. The Force Awakens held close to the first film's template, but generated modest interest by dangling new variations on the old characters. This time round, those characters are allowed insufficient development to distract from the suffocating self-awareness. Adam Driver, miscast as the now-scarred Kylo Ren, continues to suggest an evil organic cheesemonger from the southern reaches of Brooklyn. At the too-red court of the Supreme Leader Snoke – set-dressed like an avant garde 1980s production of Macbeth – Ren fumes his way towards the sort of plot revelations that, because they're so wired into the Star Wars universe, fail to generate more than an Alan Partridge shrug. Everything over here is answering a question on some arcane aspect of the franchise’s half-cocked lore. Everything over there is asking other questions that may get answered in a future episode. Nobody has time to knock together a lucid story. This is not to suggest that things don't happen. With an agreeable new character named Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) in tow, Finn (John Boyega) travels to a madly heightened version of Monte Carlo – scarcely more vulgar than the real thing – in search of a code-breaker who can do something or other. Laura Dern serves time as a charismatic admiral forced to make many of the usual painful decisions. The late Carrie Fisher is on set as a poignantly muted version of the once irrepressible Leia Organa. It is only fair to acknowledge that, for those who require such things, this stuff will fill a yawning Star Wars-shaped hole. The film-makers can call on John Williams to flavour the material with his characteristic post-Wagnerian bombast. That old trooper gets to work through some effective Star Jazz in the scenes on the Planet Monaco (as I'm pretty sure it's not called). Even casual Star Wars observers will rejoice at seeing those giant walker things making their way towards a face-off with destiny. Moreover, many of the tweaks to the universe are welcome: how pleasing that, once white suburbia in space, the series now accommodates so many Earth cultures. But there’s just too much fudge. Few of the many plots find momentum. Not until the final, tolerably cathartic denouement does it seem clear what the film is actually about. Oh, for a Roger Corman to gouge out the pretentious waffle. Oh, for a Howard Hawks to hone the unfocused relationships. I’m still unsure as to who’s supposed to be in love with whom. Never mind. It will almost certainly become the fourth-highest grossing film of all time. Who cares if some find the space opera as boring as, well, opera opera?"
"Dec 12, 2017",NEUTRAL," His sentimental sequel, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” starts with laughs and finishes with a somewhat heartfelt flourish. He’s too smart to show us another Death Star. Thank the Maker. He’s clever enough to know which old favorites the fans want to see and panders accordingly. “Change” and “kill the past” are the bywords of this middle film in the new trilogy. It’s filled with surprises, and I’ll try not to spoil those. He gives us a lot to process in his over two and a half hours of “Star Wars,” some of it recycled, much of it less than wholly satisfying dramatically. The summarizing quote is what Luke Skywalker says to young Rey, who wants to learn at the feet of the last Jedi master and thus save the Rebellion. Luke (Mark Hamill) is still on his Fortress Isle of Solitude. Leia (Carrie Fisher) is leading a dying rebellion, with every Imperial ambush reducing its ranks. Her son with Han Solo, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) remains a Vader-in-training beholden to monstrous First Order leader Snoke (motion-captured Andy Serkis) and competing with sneering General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) in villainy. Rey seeks Luke’s counsel. Poe (Oscar Isaac) and ex-Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) are all about the combat, plunging into battle, leading a lot of rebels to their deaths, which enrages Leia. There are new spacecraft on both sides as feasts to the eyes, spectacular space battles, more populous light saber fights, a “connected” ongoing argument between the galaxy’s Yin and Yang, the Dark Lord (ish) Kylo and the green but good Rey (Daisy Ridley). Its brisk open and anti-climactic climax underscore that Johnson (“Brick,” “Looper”) is not a visionary director, but a competent one. He’s smart to let some disasters in space play out in silence, but struggles to make this unwieldy “middle installment” fly and flow. The contemporary dialogue mixed in with the arch, sci-fi serial speak Lucas channeled makes for jarring listening. He put more effort into showing us the “new” — Dreadnoughts, not Death Stars, cuddly critters who aren’t Ewoks — and finding the laughs in putting our vernacular into a galaxy far far away. Where “A New Hope” had the Mos Eisely cantina scene, a saloon setting for a shoot-out, “Last Jedi” has Canto Bight, a high-end casino visited ostensibly to fetch a code-breaker (Benicio del Toro, a pointless detour with a pointless character), but really to deliver a lecture on the slavery it takes for the galaxy’s One Percent to live like moguls. Enough already with the desert planets. Instead we get a version of The Ice Planet Hoth called Crait, a world covered by salt and featuring crystalline foxes. And of course, Luke is still laying low by the rocky seas of the Scottish-looking Ahch-To — fishing, brooding, keeping the faith (sort of) and resisting training Rey when she and Chewbacca show up for a visit. The puffin-penguin bird critters there (a stocking stuffer) are cute enough to make Chewy consider going vegan. That swamp cave where Luke met his “Empire Strikes Back” destiny? It’s in a hollow tree, here. It’s a more feminine film with a lot of new female faces, on the bridge, in fighters and bombers, chief among them is the plucky plebe Rose, ineffectually played by Kelly Marie Tran. Yes, Laura Dern’s also in it, in purple hair and a leadership position. Women fight and lead and weep and slap men and try to point out that standing and fighting kills people and is not always the best solution. That feminizing fails to cure what has been the Achilles Heel of this franchise for the past 20 years, one rendered crystal clear with the superior prequel “Rogue One.”  A corporate decision to stray from the formula of classic Westerns, martial arts and combat films has all-but-outlawed that any hero in our ranks dies a sudden death (giving the films a needed shock) or a noble “death with purpose.” That lowers the stakes in these movies, robs them of emotion. Isaac handles the action well and the comic vernacular with flair, and Gleeson takes to General Hux with a certain malign, old school British character actor glee. But as mean and sullen as Driver can play, the pouty, slouch-shouldered mop-top seems out of place here, unthreatening as a villain, just sensitive enough to be the Wrong Guy for Rey to attempt to…you’ll see. The late Carrie Fisher has the look of someone who botoxed the expressiveness out of her face during her “I’m a writer, not an actress” years. The novelty’s worn off of Boyega’s “Ex-Storm Trooper Who Cries.” Hamill’s Luke is expected to transform into a new Obi Wan in this series, the wizened elder statesman and soulful wizard. I think he’d be the first to say he’s no Alec Guiness, whose imprint over the original films was far larger than his small, serene, twinkling, performance. And it does the hardcore fan’s heart no good at all to compare the pretty but impassive Ridley with the fierce, physical and emotional Felicity Jones of “Rogue One.” There’s a lot to be said for making this universe less Anglo and more diverse, less butch even. But the whole storyline in the original “Star Wars” universe has become a Big Tent political party, compromised via a party platform that promises a little something for everybody. The films pander in the worst Harry Potter tradition. That means nobody’s character is fully served by the script. Even at two and a half hours, there are jumps in logic/setting/action that don’t flow. Given what I said about “The Force Awakens,” I really wanted to like this. It starts more promisingly, has its moments. Some innovations work, others make things worse. Intentions and inspiration aside, “Last Jedi” doesn’t add up to an “Empire Strikes Back” for this trilogy. There’s no romance, little pathos and no real punch-in-the-gut moment. Its emotionally sterile tone was set with “The Force Awakens,” and that’s proven hard to shake, new innovations and plot twists aside. “Last Jedi” is just another middling movie with a rabid fanbase, a Harry Potter-style placeholder picture for lump-in-the-throat moments to come. Or so we hope. Well argued. Sounds like exactly what I was expecting; Disney is nothing if not consistent about maintaining a house style, that’s why they hire guys like Rian Johnson who are just competent enough to bring the project home on budget, but not experienced enough to actually demand any creative control or risk-taking (sounds like Trevorrow did, which is why he got the boot for Episode 9 and they handed things back to uber-hack Abrams). A heads-up to others wanting to comment on the film, which most of them haven’t seen. Personal attacks aren’t arguments, and if you want to comment and argue with evidence/examples, clean it up. Ad hominem and profane personal attacks of the “This meanie didn’t like a movie I’m looking forward to” variety won’t see the light of day.  Thank god one of the “professional” critics has there head screwed on straight. I can only assume the others were paid off or are just ignorant. JJ wrecks everything. He wrecked Trek, and he wrecked SW. **SHOCKER!** He’s all style no substance. Plot holes everywhere. No wonder Disney loves him and his new trilogy. A “non threatening” (to JJ) choice to direct “Jedi?” Mayhaps. But in his defense, I thought his first “Trek” was stellar. The difference appears to be the studio which wants max return on making George Lucas the richest man in the galaxy. Paramount left Abrams alone, more of less.  Thank you very much, You have saved me from the disappointment! I’m going to think twice before I sit to watch another new Disney: Star Wars movie. Please see this movie. Don’t let some one else’s opinion be yours. Watch with an open mind and decide for yourself.  I only read reviews after I see a movie. This movie will be the second best star wars in history after people accept it as a story in its own right. See it for yourself. Don’t just listen to “rogerinorlando”. And his opinion. Or anyone else’s. This is a sprawling film covering several decades of character development and the odds are quite good you will like something about it. “Decades of character development?” Studio representatives always want a comment (often turned into blurbs, but generally to gauge critical response) and I avoided giving them one because indifference takes time to articulate. As I started to write it, I hunted for a couple of laughs lines to illustrate the vernacular and the humor, and there were all these notes about lapses here, “Adam Driver doesn’t get it done” and the like. Sat right next to a critic who laughed at no more spots than I did, and yet I saw he gave it four stars out of four. Coward.  It is actually 93% right now. But instead of looking at the Tomato-meter, you are better off identifying the critic whose reviews most reflect your own taste and reading what they have to say. Interesting to note that Rottentomatoes, which was holding its “score” hostage to its start-up streaming video show (as it did with “Justice League,” etc.) blinked and released that info today. Metacritic, which is a more discerning critics, less fanboy driven evaluation, was eating their lunch in terms of traffic. And the  more reliable Metacritic rating, while still swooning, is a more down-to-Earth 85 aggregate avg. score. Everybody who loves these movies should go, but a lot of us are going to feel let down and look for reviews that validate that opinion. Such as here.  @Trig, well no, not really.  If a certain critic shares your outlook (for the most part), they can certainly help you decide whether or not you plunk down money for theater tickets rather than maybe wait for a more convenient and cheap option later. Compared to RotJ, too.  Yeah, the entire Endor sequence was bad, but what was happening on the Emperor’s ship remains the best of the franchise. Boy, Daisy Ridley sure looks silly in that picture. Is that supposed to be tough? She looks like a mild breeze would blow her off the cliff. Man I was hoping this one would be great. At least you weren’t tempted to give it a one word review like the unmentionable secret agent picture. We are not allowed to speak its name. Mo ah ah ah. (Sound of Thunder) I think there should be a return to 2D animation in movies like this. There’s one I really loved called “Heavy Metal.” That style I think would be great for Star Wars and not the 3D animation style. I also think there should be a Sith Wookie with half a human head and the rest Wookie all the way down to its big feet. Darth Wambo. Just kidding. Great review. My Vietnamese roommate in college told me that his mom was nearly traumatized when she watched Vader slice off Luke’s hand in Empire Strikes Back. The agonizing “AAAAHHHHHH” was especially disturbing for her. I saw that movie in the 90’s (when it was re-released in the theaters) and that scene was tough to watch. The “I’m your father” line wouldn’t be so powerful without a wounded Luke helplessly crawling away from Vader. I actually expected the movie to go on after Luke got a new hand. But it ended! The Empire literally struck back, captured Solo, and routed the rebels at Hoth. It set up the next movie nicely, and I watched Return of the Jedi a few weeks later.  I’m guessing we won’t see any of that in the new Star Wars movie. I don’t understand why Disney won’t allow directors to take the franchise to newer directions. None of the new movies will ever be good as the originals, why keep emulating them? Really appreciate the review. Helps me temper my expectations. Haven’t read much about it but what little I’ve seen has been really positive. I think I’ll shoot for being cautiously enthusiastic. Roger, I was just wondering what your feelings are for the rest of the franchise. Do you consider yourself a fan of Lucas’ original trilogy? Clearly you had lukewarm feelings about The Force Awakens, but I was just trying to put this review in the context of your thoughts on the other installments. This was brought on by your comment, “Everybody who loves these movies should go, but a lot of us are going to feel let down”. Am I to interpret that as you saying that you don’t have a real connection with these films, or feel that this series is simply so-so? I consider myself a fan of yours and find that I agree with your evaluations more often than not, but with a series such as this which holds a special place in the hearts of many viewers, knowing whether or not that is the case with you would really help me gauge how much this review would be useful to me personally. Thank you! Fair question, I adore “A New Hope,” studied its antecedents in grad school (“Searchers,””Hidden Fortress”) intensely — loved “Empire,” was fine with “Return,” was OK with the second Lucas trilogy despite Jar Jar and the blatant toy selling. Because George knows you’ve got to kill beloved characters off to have all these “Wars” mean something. Far preferred “Rogue One” to “Force Awakens” for that reason. Better actors, to be blunt, more intriguing characters and motivations and HIGHER STAKES. “Jedi” has this feminized (not talking about characters here, women in foreground, women in charge worked in “Rogue”) the whole affair, a lecture about the slavery that props up the empire (good), namby pamby “limits to sacrifice” and “just survive” etc. (NOT good) just made this clear. We don’t say “Remember the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo.” We say “Remember the Alamo.” Wimpy.  Hmmm, sounds like they played this completely safe and not much happens in terms of high-stakes. That’s not good for “the longest Star Wars”. While I can’t agree that TFA was “emotionally sterile” (Poe was fun and we lost a major character), this review tells me they attempted a balancing act and stumbled quite a bit. “Nobody’s character is fully served by the script”
And that’s the big one for me. It seems any meaningful character plotting is relegated to their books. Complex character arcs can make for better plotting than another “send these one-dimensional characters to get the macguffin” plot.
Anyway, great review, hope everyone has fun at the movies. Finally, someone with a honest review for this abomination. I remember how nostalgic I was back than at TFA premiere and how heartbroken I felt later. This one turned out to be the same, or even worse. This is not Star Wars, not for me. Sometimes people need a voice, someone to share what they are feeling to a bigger audience. Thank you sir. From one of those in the fan base that isn’t angry any more, just disappointed. What a load of garbage this film is, and how far from the glowing reviews it is, and yes, I do just like you coz we share an opinion. Hmmm. I wonder if I saw the same film you did? I can’t comment with specifics because I will never post a spoiler (I wouldn’t even have put the “cockpit” line in my review, for instance), but I would say the three things you said weren’t present for you in the film will be highly present for…let’s say MOST people. Following the film’s writing itself, the romance side is more…nuanced, for lack of a better term.  I would also argue that there are as many moments of pathos as any given SW film…and MUCH more than some of them. But even if I as a reader could (grudgingly) let those two things go, there’s no possible way I could agree with your “no gut punches” assessment. There are several, depending on the viewer. One HUGE one and a series of smaller ones, including some shards of tiny heartbreak.  Important to note…the excellent crowd I saw it with was peppered with children, probably about 1/3 of the makeup, and they were VERY into the film, reacting in every possible manner that Johnson may have intended. They cheered, laughed, clapped (often) and it was a fully joyous experience for them, which I suspect some older viewers (and critics) quite often forget. This is a fine cinematic offering from a very talented writer and director, one who very much understands that there is a tone to strike, and after achieving that one and nodding to the series, subverts almost every situation in a near impossible manner. I do see that this seems to be the gathering ground for the First Order of hard to impress angry viewers to come and vent, and perhaps that’s no mean feat, but this review feels misguided. I don’t see it as “a meanie didn’t like the film”, I think by all means, feel free to tell it how you see it. However, I wonder, as Roger Ebert often did, if this film hit the notes that it set out to achieve? I suspect a resounding yes, if Rian Johnson intended to create a beautiful, inspired and inspiring, witty, somewhat complex tribute to some of the world’s most cherished characters while breaking subversive new ground in a universe of an established formula that would appeal to moviegoers who have loved Star Wars since childhood, even if they are currently IN childhood.  Disney is transforming the films into their biggest kiddie franchise. With lots of violence. They can’t kill “Old Yeller” again. Just assorted bit players and villains.  Paul, well stated! I am very surprised by this review, the others who feel the same, and the people who would consider not seeing it because of this review. In an era of superhero movies, remakes, reboots and other unoriginal garbage, Rian Johnson took Star Wars to a new level. Funny how everyone complained that TFA was just the same old stuff, now that there is something completely different, that’s not good either. An honest review that doesn’t ignore the bad character development or simple logic that was completely ignored in the movie. This movie literally ignores it’s own canonical rules and instead of giving characters more back-round, completely glosses over all of it. Absolutely spot on. I enjoyed TFA first watvh and it lost its shine very quickly on repeat viewing. Disney played it safe with that one it felt like a Star Wars movie even if it was just more of a Greatest Hits compilation this film however has absolutely no soul to it at all and the characters are completely flat.  Just finished watching the movie and glad to have found a review that shares pretty much the exact same way I felt about the movie. I’m glad not everyone out there is wearing Star-Wars-tinted glasses. Here’s a question, as a hardcore Star Wars fan, who’s probably going to go watch it tomorrow.  Is it something new?  That was my main problem with TFA (and yours too, I think based on your review).  I pretty much knew what was going to happen.  I am not upset if this film tries to go in a new direction, just so long as it is more than a glib facsimile of the original trilogy, which we all know can never be topped. It’s new enough. New ships, some actual surprises. The arc is the same, it’s got “Empire” bones. But Johnson is saddled with Disney’s story/toy selling demands and some weak casting/character creation from the last film. The story and dialogue are a bit all over the place. Heartless, inefficiently so.
I cried at “Rogue One,” not ashamed to admit it. This is weak tea.  You will hate it. Tried to take in a new direction and just made fundamental bone head errors that crap on everything that you loved as a hardcore fan in doing so. Good luck. for me it is easily the weakest in the series. I defended the TFA despite it’s flaws, this is indefensible period. Thanks, I had not looked at IMDb’s user-comments, a torrent of abuse. And yet they’re saying it rates “8.1?” WTH? I was expecting more blowback comments here once the paying public was diving into it. Maybe this weekend the abuse will rain down. As I work for myself, and not a newspaper/wire-service etc (been there, done that), I don’t have the same fear — I think — that people still clinging to those gigs do. Disney severely cut back on screenings for this, a threat aimed in the direction of long-time reviewers. Those reviewing it know it’s going to be a smash, so bandwagon, All Aboard! But the bulk of the RT reviews are fanboy watered-down, way too many “critics.” It’s the Metacritic score that is, to me, so disheartening. A full year of Grade Inflation thanks to, I fear, a new generation of the less discriminating.  The films pander in the worst Harry Potter tradition. That means nobody’s character is fully served by the script. —–This. It’s what’s wrong all with TV/movies these days. On RT, only 57% of fans liked it.  On Metacritic, the average fan score is 5.0 of 10.  You also don’t seem to be getting showered with invective from angry fans.  That, as much as anything, I would say is a tacit admission that the people find the movie lacking. I see what you mean about this movie. I didn’t like the first 25 minutes, but then the movie gets more exciting after the first 25 minutes. For me it was missing a great beginning. Maybe next time after the scroll, the audience is taken straight from space into a strange metal planet where the main characters are in the middle of a fight on a metal world with new odd weapons. Metal. Cha Chunk Cha Chunk. heh. Just kidding. I liked the rest of the movie after the first 25 minutes. You were right though. AMC is awful at 3D. Ten minutes into the film, I noticed it wasn’t in 3D and had to tell the manager to turn the 3D on. She stopped the movie to do it, and when I returned to my seat, people shouted at me because they thought I asked for her to stop the picture. I was trying to help those people. But AMC sucks in 3D like you wrote. This time AMC really stunk. You sir, are a hero.
Were other critics paid off or is it some implicit pressure..
You may be the only one who pointed out this obsession w. strong female characters. It’s great, but when done right. And this is not the right way.
Same about diversity – give Finn and Rose enough screentime by all means, but why not make that screentime be actually something meaningful.. Well it seems several thousand people agree with you. This movie is getting hammered by user scores which in my opinion are much better than pro scores once you have a large sample size. This thing is getting around 50% on Meta and 60% on tomatoes which, given the initial reviews were likely all paid for, is more like 25% and 30%…. Thats pretty bad and by far the worst user score Star Wars has ever seen.  I definitely wont pay to see it regardless. I am a huge fan of the originals like most folks and I really enjoyed a lot of the comics and books and especially KotOR 1 & 2. But honestly I cringed through the prequels and the 1st remake (episode vii) was horrendous imho. Rogue One was ok but I wont throw any more money on these movies. Ill just wait for it to hit video and rent it. My family can wait too. The few people still working for Big Media are clinging to their jobs like grim death, afraid to offend “Star Wars” fandom? Younger generation of critics without a whole lot to compare this picture to? Or merely require something less demanding or fulfilling in different ways from people like us? It is a puzzlement.  I still can’t understand why Luke would want to kill Ben Solo rather than try first to reason with him. Luke went beyond all measures to save his father. I guess he didn’t give a crap about his nephew. Poe thinks like a Sesame Street puppet in this movie. I saw this turd a second time, and my opinion has changed. I wanted to love it. Rey has no personality or quirks to make her interesting. I hope they do a better job with new characters. There seems to be push by directors to add dumb TV put-down humor in every action movie now just to stir mouth-breathing chortles from stick heads. Go to Netflix. See “Rogue One” again. Seriously, it’s got all the heart, gravitas, character development, lump-in-the-throat sacrifice, cool additions to the universe (Forest, Donnie, Diego, Felicity, Mads, Ben Mendelssohn, Riz), it’s operating on a whole other level. Isaac is the best actor in this lot, and he’s trying too hard. Daisy is a bit of a washout, IMO. I watched “Rogue One” again Sat. night and my faith was restored — not in Disney/JJ-Rian. In the story. If they wimp this up any more, it’ll be “Star Conference: The Ladies Make Peace” — which is great, in general, crappy news for drama.  Yeah, you’re right. I didn’t give “Rogue One” a fair chance the first time. I watched it in comparison and watch The Last Jedi again. “Rogue One” is alarming in how better it is from this stiff thing “The Last Jedi.” The comedy seemed to work for many in the theater but not me. If directors are going to do comedy I think they should hire real comedy writers and not rely on their own frat boy humor. It really stinks. I think when I was a kid I saw the first advertisements for Star Wars and was excited about an Sasquatch on a space ship. However, I was even disappointed in the first Star Wars movie because I thought he might be an ape who speaks in a way the other characters can understand him and the audience would also understand. The Wookie and Droid bit is a lot like Arnold Ziffle from “Green Acres.” Rogue One is cool. I meant a Sasquatch. I liked the idea of Star Wars more than the movies. Droids and Wookies are like the comedy used in “Green Acres” with Arnold Ziffel. Another piece of comedy didn’t work: the part where Rey all of a sudden becomes stupid and mistakes The Force for a feather seemed forced. People laughed and laughed at it. I had to get stoned to watch it again and still couldn’t laugh. Pardon the missshpellings. This movie made me depressed for the future in anything. I need to see good movie fast like Taxi Driver. There are some movies I can watch many times and still like. “Face in the Crowd” with Andy Griffith and “A Touch of Evil” also seem to wash away the bad movie blues. This is the fairest review I have read. The move is better than okay as a kids and mum’s movie. Aside from the trip to the casino, which definitely does not pay off. To say the movie is rubbish is not fair.  But as a Star Wars movie it is terrible. I gave TFA a pass because I was prepared to wait and see if the unanswered questions would have a payoff, and frankly, after this movie the answer is no. Harrison Ford added so much to TFA in general and to Rey’s character in particular. Perhaps after some focus groups and trail screenings they’ll decide to make her parents significant, after all. I doubt it, an dit would be too late in any case. I suspect that they will go down the Katniss path with Kylo and Rey defeating the First Order, abolishing the Jedi, and after the cultural revolution they’ll put a council of women and eunuchs in charge and retire to a remote planet like Ahch-To and raise a family while living a simple subsistence lifestyle.  Star Wars is about warriors, not farmers, which is why Rouge One, faults and all, is infinitely better. Rogue One ticked the diversity and PC boxes and was still a good movie and was faithful to Star Wars. This star wars lacked a story.  All the questions from Awakens were either not answered or just killed off, which is bad story writing, why introduce them in one movie (when you know they’ll be more) just to downplay the characters or just kill them off (no story). The two big plots seem to take place with Luke and Leia, except one takes place over the course of a few hours (Leia) and the other a few days (at least), how does that work? I wasn’t too impressed with awakens, more so since they just redid Hope, but was really looking to see this one.  Disappointed in this effort is an understatement, and it bored me. It was just a bad movie and the fact it was a bad movie had nothing to do with how they treated the mythology of Star Wars or Luke Skywalker. Honestly, that was the least of the movie’s problems. MANY plot holes, poor dialogue and surprisingly poor acting from some great actors, boring story (spoiler alert, nothing of consequence happened to advance the plot or mythology), aside from Rey and Kylo pretty boring characters with 0 chemistry (Padme and Anakin jumped off the screen in comparison to well pretty much everyone). And by the end even Rey and Kylo journeyed to the land of predictable and boring. Even the sets made the movie feel claustrophobic unlike Rogue One which made tremendous use of its locations…
Oh, and I like Rey a lot, but even she got lost somewhere in this movie which lacked a center and a purpose.
All I have to say is: Good luck cleaning this mess up, JJ Abrams! P.S. I forgot to mention how emotionally sterile the whole thing was overall. It really was; sure it had twists and turns, but there was no passion or ferocity or swashbuckling bravado… the movie just created a sense of righteousness that is great if it were not the only emotion you were left with as a viewer. That’s another thought I had about this one while watching it. Star Wars movies are a lot like time capsules. If this one is a time capsule of 2017, this year was a convoluted mess of conflicting ideas which were all trash. There is one character who looks over the audience and tells them they should not give a fork about anything, not to stand for anything, and just look out for number one and take the money. I think it was the pointless code breaker character you wrote about. I’m mad at myself for trying to like it. I don’t know why anyone would be mad at you for doing your job as a critic. They should be glad you warned them in an intelligent way and informing them of what you did like along with what you thought was awful. And a note to the Corporate shills demanding that “everyone see it for themselves and then decide!”: Well, guess what you failed marketing hacks, unless you are going to PAY FOR MY TICKET to see the film, do it or shut up. Reading trusted and UNBIASED film critics is not only normal, but ESSENTIAL. By the time you given your precious time and money to watching a crappy film it’s too late. They’ve already got your money and are now laughing at you. But that’s what these soulless Corporations, that manufacture assembly line, unimaginative, lazy, copy cat, PRODUCTS, want. I saw this at Alamo Drafthouse and I must say the most memorable aspect of the evening was my loaded cheese fries.
There were some good scenes and the special effects were OK but for the most part it was just a jumble of nonsense and disappointment. The whole planet Vegas/codebreaker storyline was cringe-worthy. I’m only a casual SW fan but I agree that this film took a giant crap on the SW saga and mythology.
I don’t know how many times I’ve watched the original trilogy, and I’ve even seen each of the prequels at least a few times over. I doubt that I will ever have the desire to lay eyes on VIII ever again. Not out of protest or because I feel betrayed and mentally damaged by this fiasco. It just wasn’t a good movie. I wouldn’t say I’m a star wars tragic but close to it. It’s one of life’s guilty little pleasures for me. Having grown up with it, and about to turn 40, it’s that little thing that allows me to revisit my childhood from time to time, to imagine that mythical universe and follow your childhood hero’s through their crazy adventures among the stars. I read all of the EU prior to it being cut. That was fine because as much as I loved it, I was excited to get to do it all again. I’ve watched all the animated series, and played all of the video games. In short I’ve invested a great deal of time in this saga. I went in to the TFA with a clear open mind. I was happy with the result. Not great like the OT, but the fan service at least made it feel like Star Wars again which the PT certainly did not. I enjoyed the reboot enough to feel confident SW was good again in its movie form and on the right path and I defended it for what it copped. So the TLJ is coming, I don’t really do social media so no issues there, and again a clear mind, ignored all the speculation etc and the end credits roll……………………it is as though someone has just punched me in the mouth, like really hard. WTF did I just watch?? I’m not a film student or critic, so I don’t pick up on the minor details that you would, for me it’s pretty black and white. I either like it or I don’t for varying reasons. What on earth was Rian Johnson thinking? What was Disney thinking hiring him? A relative unknown at best. His past work was average, then you hand him the holy grail, and he dropped it. Where do I start?? It is an utter train wreck. A mindless plot, pointless sub plots, poor pacing poor CGI, even the score lacked the usual John Williams impact, and the biggest killer, pathetic forced humor. It was like every key moment is trashed by some rubbish joke. I have no issues with female leads, I actually really like Rey although her development in this was lacking, but the thing that kills me the most is the handling of Luke Skywalker. My boyhood hero trashed in 2.5 hours of some of the worst star wars material I’ve ever watched or read. I checked my watch 3 times during this film, answered an email and one text message. As a rule I’d never do that in a cinema especially for a SW film, but I was so burnt by what I was seeing I just didn’t really care. This movie was dead when Luke tossed his fathers saber, the princess Leia vacuum scene, I probably should have walked out. It had positives in parts but I’m so let down by the negatives they’re just null and void. That is just my opinion, others clearly love it and that is great, but I walked out feeling so let down it was like the Phantom menace all over again. I need to see it again just to confirm it was that bad, but I don’t want to spend money on it hahaha. I don’t even know where to rank this movie in the whole saga? If I’m totally honest it probably sits between Ewoks: The Caravan of Courage and Ewoks: The Battle for Endor! It’s not even in the eight. Where does it go from here? There was no cliff hanging moment, no ending that leaves you wanting more? It’s like a stand alone film that crapped on everything before it, all the lore, all the characters, and that is it. Now JJ is left to tie it all up? I don’t think there is enough lens flare to fix this mess!! That guilty little pleasure I mentioned at the start, is a whole lot hollow now. I’ll probably stick to a select few novels pre the TFA for my SW fix – but right now I’m in star wars denial. You only need to look on IMDB to see a high average user score, yet everyone who left a review gives it 2, 3 or (occasionally) 4 out of 10. A poor story played out by one-dimensional characters with little or no development, so you have no vested interest in their fate or endeavours. The attempt at humour is well wide of what is expected in a SW movie. It is a pale imitation of the OT, with no heart at all."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,I'm so thrilled that I'm able to say that Star Wars: The Last Jedi made my heart soar and filled me with happiness. I'm heartened to say that it did our Carrie proud.
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," If “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” was considered a “requel” — part remake, part sequel — of “A New Hope,” think of “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” as “The First Order Strikes Back.” If “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” was considered a “requel” — part remake, part sequel — of “A New Hope,” think of “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” as “The First Order Strikes Back.” Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) isn’t frozen in carbonite or anything. No one camps out in a tauntaun. But while it’s subtle, the thrilling new movie definitely hits several of the same thematic drumbeats as the original trilogy’s second installment. Picking up shortly after the events of “The Force Awakens,” “The Last Jedi” finds The Resistance in disarray. The First Order locates their base and has what’s left of the Rebels on the run as they search for a new home aboard a cruiser that’s quickly running out of fuel. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is still reeling after not being able to keep his nephew — Ben Solo, aka Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) — from turning to the Dark Side. And Rey (Daisy Ridley) gets a sense of how he’s been spending his self-imposed exile on, for lack of press notes, let’s call it Jedi Island. This mostly consists of spearfishing for big, weird-looking critters; milking the teats of bigger, weirder-looking critters; and putting up with the Porgs, those tiny, birdlike creatures that immediately drew the wrath of many fans thanks to their overpowering cuteness. While Rey is off trying to convince Luke to help her save the galaxy, Finn (John Boyega) sets out with Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), a maintenance worker with a serious case of hero worship for him, to try a different approach. And Poe continues to find his way as a leader while sticking close to General Organa (the late Carrie Fisher) and the remaining Rebels. (Speaking of Poe, honestly, all any of us can ever hope for is to have someone look at us the way he looks at BB-8.) “The Last Jedi” is the first of the “Star Wars” saga — not counting last year’s spinoff, “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” — with neither George Lucas nor Lawrence Kasdan as a screenwriter. It also can’t rely on the crush of nostalgia over seeing so many beloved characters for the first time in more than 30 years that helped fans — and critics — overlook some of the shortcomings of “The Force Awakens.” That’s why it’s all the more impressive that writer-director Rian Johnson (“Looper”) was able to deliver something so very satisfying. After an action-packed introduction that further explores the snarkier side of Poe, “The Last Jedi” slows to an almost methodical pace. I’ll admit, for a while I was worried. But with one fight sequence — you’ll know it when you see it — Johnson flips the switch on the hyperdrive, and the remaining 40 minutes or so are overflowing with ball-shaped-droids-to-the-wall action. Some of it is so beautifully staged, I couldn’t help but stare, gape-mawed. And there’s a very good chance you’ll need a new manicure after so much time spent tightly clutching the armrests. “The Last Jedi” is tinged with sadness and questions of what might have been whenever Fisher is onscreen. Thankfully, her role is beefed up from “The Force Awakens,” including a scene that just may be the coolest Leia’s ever been. There are a couple of big names that fail to deliver much aside from, perhaps, realizing their childhood dreams of being in a “Star Wars” movie. A trip to a city that might as well be called Space Macau also fails to pay many dividends. And the less said about the Porgs, the better. Some tighter editing would have relieved most of my mid-movie tension — as well as my bladder concerns as “The Last Jedi” stretches to an unnecessarily long 151 minutes. If not for that spectacular final act, it would be tempting to refer to it as “The Lasts and Lasts and Lasts Jedi.” Still, Johnson has crafted such a powerful, screaming geekgasm of a movie, Disney has entrusted him with creating a separate trilogy of “Star Wars” films. Around 800,000 doses of the vaccine are expected to be in place for the start of the rollout on Tuesday, a day that British Health Secretary Matt Hancock has reportedly dubbed as “V-Day,” a nod to triumphs in World War II.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," An old hope. A new realism. An old anxiety. A new feeling that the Force might be used to channel erotic telepathy, and long-distance evil seduction. The excitingly and gigantically proportioned eighth film in the great Star Wars saga offers all of these, as well as colossal confrontations, towering indecisions and teetering temptations, spectacular immolations, huge military engagements, and very small disappointments. The character-driven face-offs are wonderful and the messianic succession crisis about the last Jedi of the title is gripping. But there is a convoluted and slightly unsatisfying parallel plot strand about the Resistance’s strategic military moves as the evil First Order closes in, and an underwritten, under-imagined and eccentrically dressed new character – Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, played by Laura Dern. More successful is a new figure from other ranks: Kelly Marie Tran is terrifically good as Rose Tico, the Resistance soldier who steps up to meet her destiny as a key player in the battle against tyranny. Like The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi offers variations on the mighty orchestral themes of the original trilogy, switching occasionally to muted tones and minor keys, before cranking the volume back up. This auto-reference has become an accepted and exhilarating part of the new Star Wars rhetoric. We left the last movie as Rey, played by Daisy Ridley, is in the act of handing over a lightsaber to the haunted and monkish figure of Luke Skywalker himself, played of course by a poignantly grizzled Mark Hamill – a handing-back-of-the-baton moment of inspired paradox. No spoilers, obviously, but what Luke says and does first at the beginning of this film is startlingly unexpected: an upending of the tonal apple cart, that signals writer-director Rian Johnson’s determination to wrest the lightsaber away from JJ Abrams and put his own mark on the project. Rey must now ponder her own future and vocation. And, as for Luke, he has to reassess what the third act of his life now means. Hamill comes into his own here with a very intelligent and sympathetic portrayal of his great character. Luke is now part Prospero, part Achilles. He is potentially the great magician or teacher on this remote island, in a position to induct Rey into the Zen priesthood of the Force, and show her it is not just a matter of silly conjuring tricks and making rocks rise into the air. But might he not also be sulking in his tent, reluctant to help, for reasons apparently connected with his catastrophically failed mentorship of Kylo Ren, but perhaps for other, more complex reasons? Which brings us to Kylo Ren himself, superbly played by Adam Driver. He is now a wounded, damaged figure and he insinuates himself like a sensually predatory Satan into our consciousness in a series of dreamlike cross-cutting dialogue sequences that are the most successful part of the film. What does Kylo Ren want? As ever, the closeups on Driver’s face are gorgeous. He is never the Easter Island statue of hardness that it is possible to misremember: he is tremulous, unsure of himself, like an unhappy teenager, and his mouth seems almost on the point of trembling with tears. That breathy, resonant voice is unmistakable even from behind a neo-Vader mask. This is a villain who seems troubled about the mantle of evil on his shoulders; and, again, there are surprises in store about what Ren has in mind for the future and what his past relationship with his Uncle Luke actually was. Meanwhile, General Leia, played by the late Carrie Fisher, is commanding a complex military manoeuvre in the face of malign incursions from the First Order, represented by General Hux, played more obviously and successfully for laughs by Domhnall Gleeson. Romantic hothead pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is on the point of outright insubordination in his desire to lash out against the First Order but reformed stormtrooper Finn – an excellent, muscular performance from John Boyega – working with Rose (Tran) has a new and subtler scheme in view, which involves finding a codebreaker on a distant Vegas-ish planet offering casino betting and track racing. It is, bafflingly, a digressive plotline that gets tangled up in itself, though not without offering a good deal of entertainment. The Last Jedi gives you an explosive sugar rush of spectacle. It’s a film that buzzes with belief in itself and its own mythic universe – a euphoric certainty that I think no other movie franchise has. And there is no provisional hesitation or energy dip of the sort that might have been expected between episodes seven and nine. What there is, admittedly, is an anticlimactic narrative muddle in the military story, but this is not much of a flaw considering the tidal wave of energy and emotion that crashes out of the screen in the final five minutes. It’s impossible not to be swept away."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,"The most intelligent film in the franchise by several light years, The Last Jedi can be seen as the space-opera equivalent of Clint Eastwood's revisionist western, Unforgiven."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,The miracle of Star Wars: The Last Jedi is its rejection of series formality. Writer/director Rian Johnson manages to honor mythology while also having fun disrupting it.
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," 
	As the fate of the Jedi religion hangs in the balance, one begins to detect a certain unwillingness to stray too far from the official text in the latest 'Star Wars' sequel. Surely, all “Star Wars” fans hope each new installment will be the best ever. But in the case of “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” that seemed like an actual possibility. Written and directed by Rian Johnson, a Sundance alum who established his serious-filmmaker bona fides with his 2005 indie debut, “Brick,” before graduating to young Christopher Nolan territory via the relatively big-budget sci-fi movie “Looper,” Episode VIII seemed to have everything going for it. To the extent that “The Force Awakens” was essentially a heightened reboot of “A New Hope,” recycling many of the 1977 original’s thrills in fresh form with a mostly new cast, this latest chapter was positioned as the new trilogy’s “The Empire Strikes Back” — which is to say, a darker, more serious chapter (commonly regarded as the series’ best) that deepens the underlying mythology, shapes its emerging hero (originally Luke Skywalker, now Daisy Ridley’s Force-strong Rey), sets up an epic cliff-hanger and introduces a few big twists into the equation, including a whopping paternity surprise. As it turns out, although “The Last Jedi” meets a relatively high standard for franchise filmmaking, Johnson’s effort is ultimately a disappointment. If anything, it demonstrates just how effective supervising producer Kathleen Kennedy and the forces that oversee this now Disney-owned property are at molding their individual directors’ visions into supporting a unified corporate aesthetic — a process that chewed up and spat out helmers such as Colin Trevorrow, Gareth Edwards, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. But Johnson was either strong enough or weak enough to adapt to such pressures, and the result is the longest and least essential chapter in the series. That doesn’t mean it’s not entertaining. Rather, despite the success of “The Last Jedi” at supplying jaw-dropping visuals and a hall-of-fame-worthy lightsaber battle, audiences could presumably skip this film and show up for Episode IX without experiencing the slightest confusion as to what happened in the interim. It’s as if Johnson’s assignment was to extend the franchise without changing anything fundamental, which is closer to the way classic television and vintage James Bond movies operate than anything George Lucas ever served up. Say what you will about Lucas’ clunky, uneven prequels, but they covered a ton of story ground. By contrast, “The Last Jedi” opens and closes with scenes of Resistance bases under siege, in between which the movie’s central concern is the dwindling fuel level on a carrier ship under slow-motion pursuit by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis, who for the first time in his career probably would have been just as effective playing the character without the benefit of motion capture). Even more than last summer’s “Dunkirk,” this movie is about the honor and sacrifice of a successful retreat, which isn’t nearly as dramatic as an underdog offensive. Following the destruction of the evil First Order’s Starkiller Base, and with Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker in self-imposed retirement in “the most unfindable place in the galaxy,” the Resistance is spearheaded by Princess Leia, played by the late Carrie Fisher, whose entire performance is overshadowed by the actress’s premature death (she should be a figure of empowering female leadership, not tragedy). Rest assured, there is a lot of Leia in “The Last Jedi.” In fact, in a franchise that has always been progressive about representation, the women basically run the show this time around, which is arguably the best thing about a movie that introduces a purple-coiffed Laura Dern as the endangered ship’s No. 2 in command, Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, and save-the-day sisters Paige (Veronica Ngo) and Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), who each get significant moments to shine. Meanwhile, Rey remains the character most likely to carry on the Jedi tradition, having piloted the Millennium Falcon to the remote island where Luke is hiding, although he proves a far more reluctant teacher than Yoda ever was. (Skip the rest of this paragraph if you haven’t seen the film: The green guy makes an appearance here, surprising once again with the extent of his abilities, and from the looks of it, Johnson — or someone at a very high level — successfully made the case to go back to a practical Yoda puppet consistent with the original trilogy, as opposed to the smoother but somehow phonier-looking CG version featured in the prequels. In another nostalgic touch, this film was actually shot on film, rather than digital cameras.) Revealed as a bearded and cloaked recluse at the end of “The Force Awakens,” Luke is funnier than we’ve ever seen him — a personality change that betrays how “Star Wars” has been influenced by industry trends. Though the series has always been self-aware enough to crack jokes, it now gives in to the same winking self-parody that is poisoning other franchises of late, from the Marvel movies to “Pirates of the Caribbean.” But it begs the question: If movies can’t take themselves seriously, why should audiences? Harrison Ford was a good enough actor, and Han Solo an aloof enough character, that he could get away with it, but here, the laughs feel forced — as does the appearance of cuddly critters on each new planet. Both are reminders that the canonical “Star Wars” movies (as compared with last year’s adult-targeted stand-alone, “Rogue One”) must also appeal to very young children, for whom this can be a formative moviegoing experience — which is the kind of strategic thinking that previously brought Ewoks and Gungans into this universe. But do those audiences have bladders big enough to sit through a talky two-and-a-half-hour tug-of-war between the light and dark sides of the Force? Because that is in essence what “The Last Jedi” is about: If Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Rey are the two humans with sufficient supernatural abilities to carry on the waning Jedi religion, which side will each of them choose? We already know who Ren’s parents are (Han Solo and Leia), but what about Rey’s? “The Force Awakens” introduced a new villain in Snoke, who seemed all the more mysterious in that he loomed over Sith apprentice Ren in hologram form. Now we see him “in the flesh” (technically CG), and he’s repulsive to look at — like accidentally walking in on one of your grandparents au naturel — but not especially fear-inducing, in part because we learn so little about him or his powers. Ren makes a much better villain, as does Domhnall Gleeson’s Gen. Hux (though he too often serves as the butt of the script’s jokes), and together, they do more to terrorize Leia’s fuel-starved carrier than Snoke does. As was the case with the young Anakin Skywalker, Ren embodies a mix of ambition and unbridled rage, though Driver makes all that wild energy all the more unpredictable. His is one of the movie’s most challenging and effective performances, and though the internet will distract itself with a moment in which he briefly appears shirtless, it’s gratifying to see such a gifted actor in the part. On-screen, the First Order’s army vastly outnumbers the embattled Resistance, but for purposes of dramatic identification, Johnson provides real character detail for the good guys, even the minor ones, and their losses therefore register with greater impact than in previous movies (when, say, Luke’s fellow pilots anonymously died alongside him). The mission here is merely survival, although the tension would be greater if Snoke were doing something other than space-tailgating the Resistance for most of the movie, picking off their smaller ships as they run out of fuel. In theory, what’s at stake here is the very future of the Jedi faith (which is explicitly identified as a “religion” here). It’s kind of a big deal to suggest that the belief system upon which Lucas’ entire franchise was built could fade away entirely, unless someone new comes along to uphold it, or that its chief disciple, Luke Skywalker, is now actively campaigning for its demise. While Rey wrestles with that issue, fighters like hotshot pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and stormtrooper-turned-anti-First-Order-terrorist Finn (John Boyega) prove invaluable to the cause — even if their mission, which involves an elaborate detour to a swanky casino planet, doesn’t supply quite as much excitement as it ought to. While there, Finn and Rose present the movie’s political agenda, which disapproves of arms trafficking, regardless of which side the gunrunners are serving, and argues for the respect of all creatures (who should not be eaten, abused or raced for sport, but instead collected wherever fine toys are sold). They also pick up a stuttering codebreaker (Benicio Del Toro, bursting with personality) who fills this movie’s Lando Calrissian spot — for those keeping track of all the ways the film honors or inverts elements from “The Empire Strikes Back.” It may sound like a backhanded compliment, but with so much on the line, Johnson deserves credit for not messing things up. By contrast, Lucas got himself into trouble for not catering enough to fans with his early-2000s prequel trilogy, a situation J.J. Abrams (who serves as an executive producer here) addressed in “The Force Awakens,” which felt like a thrilling, big-budget “Star Wars” fan film. “The Last Jedi” possesses the same reverence for the galaxy Lucas created, paying homage in all the right places (from the chills we get from John Williams’ iconic fanfare to the new-and-improved walkers that appear during the climactic siege) while barely advancing the narrative. Ultimately, there’s only so much wiggle room Johnson has to play with a property that seems destined to generate a new installment/spinoff every year until we die — which means that however many Death Stars or Sith Lords the Resistance manages to defeat, there will always be more, and no matter how few Jedi remain, there can never be none."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," If ever a line in a Star Wars trailer managed to put the wind up the faithful, it was Luke Skywalker's galaxy-weary warning in the latest scene-setter. And sure enough, writer-director Rian Johnson - the first go-it-alone scribe since George Lucas - has set the controls for suspense and shocks with his Last Jedi, a movie that is at times too much of a good thing, but which still delivers that oh-so-precious cargo of moments for the memory bank.

Picking up directly after The Force Awakens, with the Rebels looking down the barrel of annihilation and young hero Rey (Daisy Ridley) and old soul Luke (Mark Hamill) still locked in their Skellig Michael staring contest, The Last Jedi goes big on identity, confusion and loss as Johnson puts characters through the existential wringer like no Star Wars director before him. Ridley makes the film her own; Hamill appears to age by the minute in his so-worth-the-wait return of the Jedi; Adam Driver embodies the ""child in a mask"" put-down thrown at his conflicted villain, Kylo Ren, while the Wild Atlantic Way is both the most stunning of backdrops and strongest of co-stars. There are times, however, when the wow factor and compelling character beats give way to the feeling that Johnson lost the run of himself with the film's duration, and that the longest adventure in Star Wars history really didn't need that distinction. Case in point is the plot involving Finn (John Boyega) and new hero Rose's (Kelly Marie Tran) McGuffinesque mission to Canto Bight, which is of the ashtray-on-a-speederbike variety, and takes away from the tension cranked up elsewhere. Chances are you'll find other sections where you wanted to see less of some actors and more of others. The campaign to get Domhnall Gleeson his own General Hux spin-off movie is now officially under way - campy doom and workplace skulduggery has rarely looked more fetching in black. You'll love his guff. And cheeky as you like, Johnson himself has doubled down with the show-stoppers in his bid to eclipse all previous Star Wars finales. That one-two more than compensates for any paunchiness elsewhere and really puts it up to the returning JJ Abrams for Episode IX in two years' time. He has his work cut out after the jaw-drops here, but the last thing he should worry about matching is the running time. © RTÉ 2024.

"
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Rian Johnson’s ‘Episode VIII’ is a true space opera—a masterful blend of humor, fun, and pathos that bares the souls of its characters and pushes the franchise to new heights. Not since George Lucas’ original trilogy has a Star Wars film felt like a dime store paperback, loaded with pulp and space operatics. Perhaps it's because A New Hope had no idea it was meant to set off a trilogy, let alone decades of story and enduring fandom, but the first three films still feel scrappy and at times messy in their quest to simply entertain audiences with characters they fell in love with in 1977. The Force Awakens sought to replicate that, to diminishing returns, but The Last Jedi harkens back to what made Star Wars so important in the first place — it’s fun, it’s kind of all over the place, but it’s dripping with emotion and pathos and, most importantly, it tells a hell of a story. As entertaining as the last installment was, it was paint by numbers. Rey's journey was basically a retread of Luke Skywalker's and Poe Dameron was a new iteration of Han Solo. Finn, seemingly a love interest for Rey and Poe (the latter in the audience's minds), fell into the Leia position. But more than that, it was less about telling a new story and more about checking in with Han and Leia and folding them into a film that should've been focused on expanding the Star Wars universe. That has changed with The Last Jedi, which finally has fun with the new characters who've been added to the series. With Han dead and Leia in General mode, Poe is finally allowed to step into his role as a lead and get in on the action. He becomes the de facto lead of the film, at least in terms of pushing the narrative forward. Mixing Finn and Kelly Marie Tran's Rose into Poe's orbit is one of writer and director Rian Johnson's better moves, because it lets the story rely on different dynamics than we've been used to since Star Wars first premiered. We know that we're here to see Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, R2-D2, and C-3PO interact, but this time they complement the story rather than participating in a reenactment of films we've seen before. This is true of Luke in particular, who has his psyche dissected by Johnson during most of The Last Jedi's runtime. This is a film more interested in character than any film since the original trilogy — it's not using broad strokes to create Darth Vader's origin for instance, it's deepening the journeys of Star Wars' most essential characters. This is a Luke we've never seen before, and yet it's an altogether realistic one and his inclusion in the film manages to be funny, melodramatic, and essential in a way that J.J. Abrams failed to use Han in the previous film. The film has quite a bit in common with The Empire Strikes Back, obviously, in that they're both middle pieces of a trilogy, but also in how it sprawls its characters to the edges of the universe to fully devote itself to the concept of telling a space opera. It's a subgenre of sci-fi that's as devoted to melodrama and romance as it is to future technology and warfare, and here Johnson manages to heighten the soapiness of the series in offbeat ways. For instance, Laura Dern's character is straight out of a mid-20th century queer novel—not in sexual orientation; there are still no gay characters in the Star Wars universe, which has only now found its first heroine of color in Rose, so baby steps—but in how over the top, snarky, and derisive of Poe's chauvinistic antics she is. Mix in delicate close-ups of Oscar Isaac's hard-boiled stubble, Adam Driver's pecs, and a heart-swelling kiss in the midst of an epic battle and you've got pulp dialed to 11. It's a sign that Johnson understands the series well enough to upend it and deliver things we've never seen before. Dern and Rose in particular, but also a fantastically hilarious MacGuffin Johnson throws into the film midway that resolves itself with a punchline rather than a crescendo. It's the work of a master helmer and writer who has operated in the sci-fi, pulp, and noir genres and knows how to blend them effortlessly to breathe new life into stories that pop culture has been telling for years. There are many familiar beats to The Last Jedi, yes, but they're done with such aplomb, such reckless abandon, that they feel not only fresh but absolutely fucking awesome. Who'd have ever thought they'd see the trappings of a James Bond casino royale in the middle of a Star Wars film? As the film hurtles toward its conclusion (but not before several dizzying climaxes come to fruition), you might be left wondering where the series will go next. Our characters aren't left in the kind of mortal danger that their predecessors were in their Empire Strikes Back cliffhangers, they're instead faced with psychological dilemmas — and it makes for a new, exciting foray into what it means to be trapped in this endless war of light and dark. Johnson has already been tapped to create a new Star Wars trilogy in the coming years, off the predicted success of this film. It seems that for the near future, amid the lightsaber battles and love triangles among the stars, we can also look forward to science-fiction that looks into its characters' souls just as much as it speeds toward galaxies far, far away."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Rian Johnson grew up a Star Wars fan. There’s a well-known story about him getting a Millennium Falcon toy as a kid and accidentally breaking it when he tried to make it fly. Watching Star Wars: The Last Jedi, which Johnson wrote and directed, one gets the distinct sense he’s been waiting his whole life to make this movie; to guide these characters, to make the Falcon fly. The people in Star Wars implore one another to fulfill their destinies. With The Last Jedi, Johnson fulfilled his. Given the opportunity, he made the best Star Wars since The Empire Strikes Back. The film actively invites such comparisons. As the second film in the new Star Wars trilogy that began with 2015’s The Force Awakens, it is littered with parallels and allusions to Empire. Both films scatter their trio of protagonists across the galaxy. Both follow the Rebels (or the Resistance, as they’re now known) on the run from the Empire (or the First Order). Both introduce amoral characters who can’t be easily categorized as heroes or villains. And both feature a budding Jedi warrior waylaid on a distant planet, under the training of an eccentric teacher. In Empire, the young Jedi was Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill); now he is the eccentric teacher. At the end of The Force Awakens, Rey (Daisy Ridley) finally finds him on the planet of Ahch-To, where he has been hiding for years. With the First Order on the rise, General Leia (Carrie Fisher) has dispatched Rey to retrieve Luke, a source of hope throughout the galaxy, and convince him to rejoin the fight. For Rey, who discovered her own powerful connection to the Force in the last movie, the mission also gives her a unique opportunity to train with the last Jedi. But Luke is committed to letting the Jedi ways die with him, following a disaster at the last school he founded. One of his students, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), was turned to the Dark Side by Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), and then murdered all the other students. Now Kylo and Snoke are on the verge of destroying the Resistance, but Luke refuses to come back and face them, or to help Rey learn to focus her untapped powers. If there’s one major issue with The Last Jedi, it’s this: After seven films, Star Wars has a lot of characters and subplots to service. Even with two paragraphs of plot I barely mentioned Leia, who’s leading the Resistance on a desperate race to find a new secret base with the brave but reckless Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). And I didn’t include a single mention of Finn (John Boyega), the First Order defector who became a trusted Rebel ally and now is sent on a quest that introduces two new characters: Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), a Rebel maintenance worker, and DJ (Benicio Del Toro), a charismatic scoundrel. It takes Johnson a long time to put all of these pieces together and after a flurry of excitement in the opening space battle, the first and second acts of the movie settle into a surprisingly talky groove. The Force Awakens was undeniably more exciting, particularly in the early scenes that introduced Rey, Poe, and Finn in thrilling fashion. But it also seemed to hew a little too closely to the franchise formula. The Last Jedi checks off all the boxes you want from a Star Wars movie, including one of the coolest lightsaber fights in the series’ 40 years, but Johnson is also interested in exploring new territory, including a consideration of the shadings and nuances to the Light and Dark Sides of the Force. Past Star Wars have treated the two sides as a kind of yin and yang but Johnson digs into what that really means, and makes us reconsider preconceived notions of what the “good guys” and “bad guys” of the galaxy really stand for. Along the way Johnson’s screenplay provides some of the series’ most moving life lessons (the one about masters and students obliterated me) and a surprising number of big laughs — the film’s generally foreboding mood is regularly punctuated by a steady stream of hilarious one liners and visual gags.  It’s also very clear that this series has never had a director as good with actors as Johnson. Hamill’s performance in The Last Jedi may be the best in any Star Wars movie. Audiences barely got to see Luke Skywalker in The Force Awakens, but he’s front and center throughout The Last Jedi. Years of mistakes have hardened the hero we once knew, along with Hamill’s features, although Luke’s humanity sneaks through in beautiful close-ups that linger on his moist eyes as he talks about Han Solo or reconnects with his old pal R2-D2 for the first time in decades. The fall of Luke Skywalker, and the way Hamill plays this spoiled icon of youthful heroism, is exactly what makes these new Star Wars special. There’s a lot of fantasy and fiction in these films. But what time has done to Hamill’s face, and the way his idealism has given way to something sadder and more realistic, couldn’t be faked with special effects. It requires the wisdom of age. But even amidst the melancholy, there is a ton of joy and excitement in The Last Jedi; like the Force, this Star Wars is all about balance. Rian Johnson understands better than a lot of people who’ve worked on Star Wars — including George Lucas at times — that this saga is not about lightsabers or cool spaceships and aliens. At its core, Star Wars is about hope and inspiration. Without spoiling it, pay attention to the final scene of The Last Jedi. Observe who the last character on screen is, and what this person does. I believe that in this moment, this character is playing the role of Rian Johnson, and all the Rian Johnsons of the world who’ve found in Star Wars the spark that fueled their dreams. Additional Thoughts:-Adam Driver delivers the other great performance in this movie. Kylo Ren initially looked like a cheap Darth Vader knockoff but he’s proven to be the franchise’s most interesting new character. Driver’s astonishing range — he can play a petulant child in one scene, and a sensitive heartthrob in the next — serves Johnson well. -Among other things, The Last Jedi is a defense of George Lucas’ notorious comments (at least among some longtime fans) that Star Wars is really for kids. The Last Jedi is dark and mature in some ways. But several key scenes make it obvious that Johnson is aiming his message at a young audience. I hope they hear him loud and clear."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," If you are wondering why director Rian Johnson has been handed the keys to the “Star Wars” franchise, and been allowed to create a whole new trilogy, look no further than what he’s accomplished in “Star Wars: The Last Jedi.” After J.J. Abrams helmed the first “Star Wars” movie beyond ""Return of the Jedi"" 32 years ago with 2015's “Episode VII: The Force Awakens” — an entry that featured new characters but also included many familiar hallmarks from the original three movies — Johnson has essentially delivered a sequel that forges a new path in the “Star Wars” saga, as it extends the mythology without using the original three as a crutch. “The Last Jedi” (opening in theaters on Friday) breaks the usual rules sequels live by. Put simply: It doesn't just take the things the audience loves about the previous movies and amplify them. Unfortunately, going into detail on how “The Last Jedi” breaks these rules would divulge things about the movie that would spoil it for you, but what I will say is that all the fan theories that sprung from “The Force Awakens” mean very little. Johnson, who also wrote the screenplay, proves there are greater things to explore — more complex and fascinating subplots. And to get to those he gives us a movie with the kind of moments you usually never see in the second film of a trilogy. We left off in “The Force Awakens” with the Resistance destroying the First Order’s Starkiller Base and Rey (Daisy Ridley) going off to track down Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). At the start of “The Last Jedi,” Rey is still on the island Skywalker has purposely used to hide from the universe, and the First Order has tracked down the Resistance and is looking to wipe them out. This is the foundation of “The Last Jedi,” as both settings are where we stay for most of the movie. But thanks to multiple characters we care about and a surprising amount of lightheartedness, the 2.5-hour running time never gets boring or stagnant. 
                          
                        We follow Rey delving deeper into the power of the force, under the reluctant guidance of Skywalker. Poe (Oscar Isaac) and General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) are together for most of the movie, with the legendary Resistance leader trying to make the talented fighter pilot understand the difference between heroism and leadership. Finn (John Boyega) finds a new girl to go on adventures with, Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran). But out of the new crop of characters, the most fascinating is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Ren is still trying to prove to Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) that he can be as evil as Darth Vader. But more importantly, Johnson further explores the mysterious connection Ren has with Rey. This is done using a heightened way of the force that has never been fully fleshed out in the saga before. The complexities, anger, and manipulation that Driver gives Ren are a major highlight of the movie. It’s far from the only thing that’s impressive, but it’s just refreshing to see a fleshed out villain in this era of blockbusters and superhero movies where the bad guy character feels hastily put together. Hamill’s return as Skywalker does not disappoint, either. The master Jedi has tried to block himself entirely from the legendary life he once lived, and the tipping point was Skywalker's failure to train Ren (aka Ben Solo). This is explained to Rey by both Skywalker and Ren, with Johnson cleverly using a “Rashomon”-like storytelling style to do it. 
                          
                        And this isn’t the only time in the movie when Johnson uses the feel of classic Asian cinema to influence his storytelling. The sections that involve Skywalker’s story have the feel of old samurai movies, with Luke as the elderly teacher who has nothing left in his life but the past, and the knowledge of his craft, neither of which he wants anymore. Johnson also shows this visually with a striking shot of Skywalker’s X-Wing resting at the bottom of the shallow water by the cliffs where he lives. Another great part of “The Last Jedi” is that Johnson pulls off the difficult task of giving solid screen time to the ensemble, and including the new characters. Rose Tico is a spark plug of energy. Benicio Del Toro was born to be in a “Star Wars” movie, and he pulls off another unique speaking style for his role as the code breaker, DJ. And Laura Dern as Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo has one of the biggest WOW! moments in the movie. Then there’s Leia. “The Last Jedi” marks the final performance in the iconic career of Carrie Fisher. She gets a good amount of screen time, including one scene that will certainly spark some major internet chatter. If there’s one knock I have on the film it’s that, once again, Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) is given very little screen time. Guess we can only hope that will be rectified in “Episode IX.” It certainly looks like Disney/Lucasfilm has found the filmmaker who it can use to extend the saga beyond just rehashing the greatness of the original three movies. That’s perhaps the best part of “The Last Jedi.” Johnson has made something that isn’t just a worthy addition to one of the most fan obsessed franchises ever, but is also a powerful standalone story."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Written and Directed by Rian Johnson.
Starring Daisy Ridley, Mark Hamill, Adam Driver, Carrie Fisher, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Peter Mayhew, Anthony Daniels, Laura Dern, Kelly Marie Tran, Benicio del Toro, Billie Lourd, Gwendoline Christie, Lupita Nyong’o, Jimmy Vee, Tim Rose, Warwick Davis, Hermione Corfield and Veronica Ngo. Having taken her first steps into the Jedi world, Rey joins Luke Skywalker on an adventure with Leia, Finn and Poe that unlocks mysteries of the Force and secrets of the past. No one can say that Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a previous entry in a different skin (the most commonly agreed-upon complaint with Star Wars: The Force Awakens was its lack of originality, opting to ape beat for beat the plot of A New Hope), as writer and director Rian Johnson (the sci-fi brainiac behind the greatness that is Looper) has crafted an installment that largely defies saga standard narrative structure and tone. There is a quick comedic dialogue exchange in the beginning between Oscar Isaac’s fighter pilot Poe Dameron and Domhnall Gleeson’s First Order General Hux that falls in line with the brand of humor Disney and Marvel inject into that particular cinematic universe; it’s a moment that feels like a tone-setter, but jokes never really return outside of a few throwaway one-liners completely free from danger. This is more palatable to last year’s spinoff prequel Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, evoking the cost of war with gloom, endless struggle, tragic deaths, and hopelessness searching for a rebellious spark. It’s also quite literally a war in the stars, as the Resistance is trapped in the crosshairs of Supreme Leader Snoke’s cannons and laser ships where retreating is not an option considering the tyrannical forces now have a method of tracking movements through lightspeed. Technically, the Resistance could flee, although it would be all for naught as they are quickly running out of fuel and unable to fully escape conflict. The situation puts all of their high-ranking leaders including General Leia (Carrie Fisher once again bringing grace, wisdom, and strategical qualities) in a tough predicament regarding how to move forward, as it all comes down to Rey and whether or not she can convince Luke to join the fight. What this means is that roughly 40% of The Last Jedi takes place in deep space while another 40% deals with Rey on an island uncovering truths and secrets about Luke Skywalker and Kylo Ren. The remaining 20% is made up of two different locales, one of which is entirely superfluous to the story. Essentially, there is a subplot that introduces Benicio del Toro’s mysterious work of eccentricity, except it doesn’t really do much of interest with him. Admittedly, it feels as if the character could be destined for bigger things in the final chapter, but I can only go off of what I watched, and well, the middle portion of The Last Jedi is stuck in the furthest setting from lightspeed. The journey expands to a space-Vegas full of various alien life forms and inhabitants, but it’s not as visually striking as previously explored planets. Additionally, by design, there seems to be filler injected simply because the other characters need things to do while Rey accomplishes what she needs to with Luke. On that note, Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren continues to be a standout performer and character in the new trilogy, harnessing his unstable inner good vs evil demons to bring forth a ferociously unhinged personality. Darth Vader was certainly evil, but also understood his goals and purpose with a collected calm; Kylo is unpredictable and doesn’t become easier to read as more details emerge, making him all the more terrifying. Intriguingly, the film successfully adds complexities to the relationship between Luke and Kylo that doesn’t betray Star Wars lore. Up until now, Star Wars heroes and villains generally align on a fairly clear-cut morality spectrum, which is something Rian Johnson shoots into a vacuum. Parts of Kylo are actually sympathetic, and that’s not an easy feat to accomplish factoring in his recent actions. Of course, Luke plays a much larger role this time (for starters, he actually has dialogue and a bunch of key scenes) ranging from shaping Rey’s future to coming to terms with past events. It also helps that Mark Hamill and Daisy Ridley share strong chemistry, so much that it would be highly enjoyable to watch a film consisting of just them discussing important themes, history, and how to deal with the war. Johnson also goes out of his way to amusingly answer some fans’ burning questions such as “What has Luke been eating and drinking to survive on the island”, with the answer conjuring up an immediate “Forget I was ever curious”. Rest assured, Luke does get more material than cracking jokes; he and Rey’s argumentative interactions is the backbone of the experience. If there’s any character that gets the short end of the stick as far as development goes, it’s Supreme Leader Snoke. Andy Serkis does a phenomenal job with the motion capture, imbuing the malevolent being with an intimidating voice and lifelike expressions, but there is disappointment all around with how he’s implemented. There are other returning characters such as Gwendoline Christie’s Captain Phasma that once again feel pointless, but at least she’s not a major character worth getting worked up over. Crowded supporting players aside, the script does do a serviceable job at maturing Poe from an impulsive and reckless fighter, along with giving John Boyega’s Finn a love interest played by escape pod mechanic Rose (Kelly Marie Tran). All of these elements come together to create a middle chapter with hefty stakes and dramatic consequences. Visually and sonically, the film is stunning with the grandiose space battles rendered a dazzling sight to behold as the cinematography swirls in circular rotations and tracks aircraft through the thick of peril. If you have the opportunity, absolutely see it in Dolby Cinema as every single piece of destruction and explosion sticks out with crystal clarity, as does the entire ending sequence built on epic confrontations. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is another outstanding entry in the new trilogy, one that doesn’t distinctly feel like Star Wars but not necessarily a Rian Johnson film either. Pacing issues and onslaught of characters aside, there is a lot to marvel here leaving a whole lot left to get excited about. Even the few plot points that feel telegraphed are delivered in ways that subvert expectations. When The Last Jedi has seemingly reached its conclusion, it refuses to end, continuing bracing forward full throttle into one last hurrah of grand scale theatrics, and in that moment you’ll never want it to finish as the heart-sinking realization of being impossibly forced to wait two more years for Episode IX settles in."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE,Rian Johnson has created a movie that is both quintessentially Star Wars and richer than anything that has come before.
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Very rarely is anything ever black or white. All too often in life there’s a gray area, where nuance opens the floor for tough decisions to be made, blurring the lines between right and wrong. For the most part, Star Wars has bucked that trend, striving to be a mythologized story about good and evil — or rather, the light and the dark side. But, that age-old tale becomes not only predictable, but repetitive, which is why the franchise hasn’t had a gasp-worthy narrative since 1980’s The Empire Strikes Back, when Luke Skywalker met his big, bad daddy. Now, three prequels, two sequels, and one anthology film later, the series finally has some ingenuity in the tank. Or, to paraphrase Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), “the spark that will light the fire that’ll burn the nostalgia down.” Take off those rose-tinted lenses and you’ll see that nostalgia has been a major issue for this new era of Star Wars. It all started with 2015’s The Force Awakens, when J.J. Abrams decided to turn Episode VII into an ultra-safe reboot of the 1977 original, echoing the story beat for beat in an all-too-lazy attempt to “make things right,” as Max von Sydow cheekily states in the movie’s opening. He wasn’t wrong, per se: Despite the film’s gluttonous Remember Whens, both Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan happened to deliver a handful of lovable new characters in Poe, Finn (John Boyega), Rey (Daisy Ridley), and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Which is why it was so frustrating that they leaned so hard on familiarity, something that also plagued last year’s Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Looking back, though, Abrams was simply building the nu-retro IKEA table for Rian Johnson to play on with his own action figures and playsets. As both writer and director of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the mastermind behind 2012’s Looper and 2005’s Brick is far less concerned with standing on ceremony than burning it all to ashes — sincerely. “Let the past die,” Kylo Ren states at one point. “Kill it, if you have to. That’s the only way to become what you are meant to be.” Hey, the little brat is not alone, sharing the same sentiments with the one and only Luke Skywalker, who tells Rey, “I only know one truth: It’s time for the Jedi … to end.” (By the way, those lines are both from the trailer, so let’s not go nuts, okay?) Everyone’s ready for New Coke in Johnson’s world. Sure, there are a number of parallels to both The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, what with the whole Jedi training bit, the narrow escapes from the Imperials, and pretty much everything involving Snoke, but they’re all in service of much grander change. Johnson is so clearly aching to break free from the shackles of nostalgia that it’s downright admirable — and yet also surprising. The amount of free reign that Disney gave this guy is astounding. Not since Irvin Kershner has a director been able to truly put his own stamp on a Star Wars film, and Johnson reaches for the stars both narratively and visually. Not all of it works — you know, like when a certain droid stupidly commandeers a certain Imperial walker — but it’s refreshing to know there’s at least some autonomy in a franchise that’s been fraught with committee-based filmmaking. And how! Believe it or not, but The Last Jedi might be the most politically charged entry in the long-standing saga. Whether he’s lambasting the military industrial complex or biting his thumb at the one-percenters, Johnson never spares a moment to weld in some kind of choice commentary. Much of this is funneled into the narrative of Kelly Marie Tran’s new hero, Rose Tico, but really, his most powerful political sentiments are at the expense of our most sacred heroes. In a ballsy move, Johnson seemingly force chokes the entire baby-boomer generation for their past sins, namely how they’ve betrayed their morals and affected future generations in the long run. It’s a risky move that may piss off the more puritanical fan, but one that gives an unbelivably dark weight to the story. Rest assured, there’s plenty of fun to be had elsewhere. You want more Poe? You got more Poe. You want characters floating in space? You’ll float, too. You want a bunch of critters both crazy and cute? You got crystal foxes and Porgs. You want veteran actors going H.A.M. in a galaxy far, far away? You got Laura Dern and Benicio del Toro having the time of their lives being glamorous and goofy, respectively. Hell, the fact that this sucker runs nearly three hours — and was reportedly first cut at that length — is a testament to Johnson’s ambition. And it’s hard to criticize ambition with regards to Star Wars, seeing how that’s partly been its Achilles’ heel as of late. No, this is a sequel that keeps on giving, even when the giving gets a little too much. For all its strengths, The Last Jedi is a very manic film, fueled by excellent ideas that could have been parsed out in smarter ways. Like a young Anakin Skywalker — or rather, a teenage Ben Solo — Johnson gets reckless with his new powers, twisting and evolving the narrative in ways that become almost exhausting, even if it’s often interesting. It’s like listening to your old man rattle off compelling stories far into the night; at some point, you want to stop him and say, “Whoa, Pops, save some of these for later, huh?” This is a good problem to have in the writer’s room, but not on the silver screen. Four epic climaxes and five solid endings is downright gluttonous, especially given that this is the middle of the trilogy, where things need to linger. That’s not to say things aren’t simmering by the end of The Last Jedi. Again, what’s most exciting about this chapter is how Johnson shakes up the past and the future. Luke Skywalker has never been more intriguing, returning to audiences as this grizzled sad sack with a chip on his shoulder, and Mark Hamill delights in the new fatigues. Kylo Ren’s motives are by far the most labyrinthine of any villain in this series, embracing the sours of change in ways that will only be appeasing to those who have always welcomed them. Looking more and more like Alan Rickman circa Prince of Thieves, a now-maskless Driver oozes with venom and pathos previously unseen during the majority of Force Awakens. Similarly, Ridley offers a more personable turn as Rey, whose murky background now seems thankfully superfluous to her vital path ahead. The only issue is that Johnson can’t contain his excitement, ever eager to move on to the next beat. To be fair, Abrams also overstayed his welcome with The Force Awakens, opting for the next money shot with the super-rushed Skywalker reveal, when he should have stayed behind to grieve over Han Solo. Johnson overindulges at the end, too, but it’s mostly at the expense of what could have been some great final shots. Still, one gets the sense that each writer and director who hops aboard this proverbial ship tries to do whatever they can before the next hotshot follows. And let’s not forget, Hollywood dunce Colin Trevorrow was originally supposed to take the reins from Johnson, so maybe he wanted to get in all of his most brazen ideas before the class clown behind Jurassic World came in for the pre-imminent fumble. Or, maybe these sequels have simply been in the hands of geeks who always dreamed of being George Lucas … and don’t want to wake up. If so, both surpassed their Master. Whereas Abrams recaptured the majesty and innocence of the original trilogy with the much tighter Force Awakens, Johnson nails the ingenuity and the politics of the prequels with the far looser Last Jedi. And say what you will about that godawful second trilogy, but Lucas was never out of bold ideas or social commentary. His problem was that he could never make it fun; instead, it was like hanging around a bunch of trees wearing cheap clothing from a local Renaissance fair. That’s not the case for The Last Jedi, which not only retains the magic of its predecessor, but takes some audacious risks in the process. Not all of them land — some are even quite asinine — but they’re the type of risks this franchise needs in order to stay unpredictable. In fact, the worst thing to do now would be to restore any kind of balance to the Force."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Nick Cave has been singing about mortality for decades, and he's really good at it. Whether the narratives are biblical or pulpy, the victims innocents or death row convicts, the circumstances comprehensible or cruelly random, Cave's songs are on intimate terms with the infinite ways a life can be extinguished. And yet, ""Skeleton Tree"", his latest album with his estimable band, the Bad Seeds, is a relatively concise song cycle shadowed by death that feels different than all the rest. Read the full review.

""Blonde"" is a critique of materialism with Frank Ocean employing two distinct voices, like characters in a play, a recurring theme throughout the album and perhaps its finest sonic achievement. A party spirals out of control, the music rich but low key, a melange of organ and hovering synthesizers. Ocean uses distorting devices on his voice to add emotional texture and to enhance and sharpen the characters he briefly embodies. The upshot: They're all little slices of Ocean's personality with a role to play and they each sound distinct. Read the full review.

Read the review. Great fun, and a reminder that unpopular political leaders mock the Resistance in other galaxies, too, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” boasts a bald-faced lie of a subtitle — sorry, folks, last Jedi, no more “Star Wars” movies! — and special guest appearances from some old, familiar faces. The oldest of them utters a very funny line about the sacred Jedi religious texts being the opposite of page-turners. It’s a lot of movie, in a good way. Writer-director Rian Johnson, in his fourth feature and the first of what will be, for him, at least four “Star Wars” outings, has whipped up 152 minutes’ worth of pursuit, evasion, mayhem, team-building, explosions, nostalgia and, yes, wit (spoiler alert: actual wit). This is the longest movie in the franchise. It just doesn’t feel that way. I haven’t been this into a “Star Wars” picture since the Empire struck back in “The Empire Strikes Back.” Now: I say this as a critic, and as a civilian, who holds little affection for George Lucas’ second trilogy (“Phantom Menace,” “Attack of the Clones” and “Revenge of the Sith”), or for “Return of the Jedi,” for that matter. Here’s why the new one works. You can tell there’s a clever, admiring but not slavish filmmaker at the helm, as you could with Irvin Kershner and “Empire” back in 1980, and it’s clear he enjoyed a fair amount of leeway, tonally and otherwise. Building on what he learned on his Raymond Chandler riff “Brick” (2005), the archly stylized caper “The Brothers Bloom” (2008) and, heretofore, his sole mainstream hit, the deftly managed time-travel thriller “Looper” (2012), Johnson’s first visit to LucasLand darts and zigzags with an unusual lightness of touch for an effects-heavy franchise title. It’s swift but not monomaniacal in its pacing. Characters both old and new, of various earthly and intergalactic ethnicities (spoiler alert: white supremacists will not like “The Last Jedi”), all enjoy a little elbow room, and their fair share of the action. Speaking of which … Johnson’s best action sequence is his smallest and simplest, a lightsaber standoff  late in the film.  The crowd loved it, and I was in that crowd. “The Last Jedi” plays by the rules laid out in director J.J. Abrams’ 2015 reboot “The Force Awakens.” Much as Harrison Ford served as mythic grounding in “The Force Awakens,” Mark Hamill takes top billing here as Luke Skywalker. We last saw Luke in his Hobbitty hoodie, a disillusioned recluse on an island on “the most unfindable place in the galaxy,” as he says to Jedi-in-the-making Rey, played once again by the invaluable Daisy Ridley. Several questions are asked and either answered or artfully evaded by “The Last Jedi.” Rey’s family history; the extent and secret source of Luke’s profound disillusionment; these and other puzzlers are nicely spaced out by Johnson, in between aerial dogfights and visits to the next planet on the movie’s itinerary. At one point Finn (John Boyega) and his fellow Resistance fighter Rose (Kelly Marie Tran, a highlight of the new character roster) search for a “master codebreaker” on a planet resembling a mashup of Catalina Island, Monte Carlo and the cantina from the very first “Star Wars,” with tonier clientele. The digital effects, the production and costume designs, the creature designs and everything else spinning around in this big-budget blender all combine to satisfy the audience’s collective “throw it at me!” impulse, as well as its sentimental, “O, lost youth!” one. I like the blood-red salt on the salt planet; I really like the extra-sudden WHOOOMMPP of the hyperspace jumps, similar to the old ones but whoompier, thanks to the sound design and to the latest Dolby technology. Now and then Johnson’s jokes don’t quite come off, or he’ll settle for a routinely staged and framed shot of people getting on or off a spaceship. Before long, though, the movie’s back on track, and moving fast. The first in the trilogy laid out the threat posed by Luke’s protege, Ben Solo, who killed his father, Han Solo, and defied his mother, Princess Leia, now a general in the struggling Resistance. “The Last Jedi” is Carrie Fisher’s swan song. She completed her scenes shortly before her death. Johnson wisely makes no attempt to pull our heartstrings more than they’re already being pulled simply by watching Fisher portray her most famous role one last time. Adam Driver got off to a somewhat rocky start in “The Force Awakens,” uneasily navigating the bratty-adolescent comedy called for by that script’s early scenes. Here, much improved; Driver plays to Kylo’s light and dark sides convincingly, and effectively. Oscar Isaac’s a charismatic asset, as he was in “The Force Awakens,” as the impetuous flyboy Poe Dameron, the pilot most likely to be voted winner of the Han Solo Act-Alike Contest. Much will be resolved by the final chapter of the trilogy, to be directed by Abrams. As much as I enjoy his brand of canny populism, I prefer Rian Johnson’s wilder, generous, far-flung imagination."

Rolling up with the kind of intergalactic swagger that gives us a cosmically infuriating phone prank within the first five minutes, ‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi’ is a work of supreme confidence: witty, wild and free to roam unexplored territory. If JJ Abrams’s franchise-rebooting ‘The Force Awakens’ (2015) was the creation of a boy who lovingly dusted off old toys and put them through their expected poses, its superior sequel is made by a more inventive kid – maybe one with a sideline as his block’s most inspired D&D Dungeon Master –who asks: Why can’t a Rebel fleet be commanded by Laura Dern in a purple wig? Why can’t we have planets of blood-red sand, herds of rampaging alien cattle or adorable puffin-esque porgs invading the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon like wannabe copilots? That kid is writer-director Rian Johnson, previously a maker of such mind-colonising indies as ‘Brick’ and ‘Looper’. Here, he’s been given awesome licence to steer this beloved series into hyperspace. (His chapter should be studied by Hollywood execs tempted to entrust their billion-dollar properties to the humourless.) ‘The Last Jedi’ scrapes the psychologically dark edge of George Lucas’s original middle chapter, ‘The Empire Strikes Back’, but carries that grandeur with ease. Centrally, Johnson creates a running head-to-head dialogue – almost a mystical form of FaceTime – between Rey (Daisy Ridley), rising warrior of the Resistance, and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver, as tortured as he was in Martin Scorsese’s religious-themed ‘Silence’), a furious Darth Vader in the making. Their running conversation hints at the inevitability of their meeting in the flesh; it even vibrates with a sexual charge. ‘Star Wars’ has long been a form of Wagnerian opera, but rarely has it treated space and time this pliably. Along that sturdy throughline, Johnson peppers the plot with eye-widening sequences: titanic wedge-like destroyers exploding in action scenes of off-planetary warfare; swirling lightsaber duels; the sparky comic byplay between courageous Finn (John Boyega) and a new character, a no-bull mechanic named Rose (Kelly Marie Tran); and Rey’s own experiences on a fog-shrouded island, home to none other than glum Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill, rarely this magnetic). After taking his lightsaber and unceremoniously tossing it off a cliff – again, Johnson relishes confounding superfans – Luke slowly swings back into the spirit of things. The movie stokes the embers of radicalisation, even those cooled by personal tragedy: It’s a blockbuster about getting back on your feet, flicking the dirt off your shoulder and heading into battle recharged. That’s an invigorating idea to smuggle into big-budget entertainment. For all of Johnson’s skill in conjuring a universe of chatty droids (and crafty thieves played by Benicio del Toro, sure to be seen again), he understands that ‘Star Wars’ has always been a vessel that we, as audiences, fill with our own timely preoccupations. There’s no denying the overwhelming emotional thrill of seeing Carrie Fisher – whose final performance shows no sign of digital trickery – inspire her team of fighters from all walks of life, all shapes and colors. ‘We have everything we need,’ we hear at the rebels’ darkest hour. Johnson has taken that as his rallying cry and poured 40 years of imagineering into his own mould, emerging with an absolute winner. He’ll have to show us that Jedi mind trick someday.

"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," You may or may not be surprised to learn I do not automatically swoon every time I hear the words ‘Star Wars’. But, I’ll be damned if I didn’t feel a distinctive shiver down my spine watching The Last Jedi. It’s been no easy task adapting this saga for a new generation. While J.J. Abrams did an admirable job making the big leap with The Force Awakens, it’s Rian Johnson who takes the reins and makes this baby run. Adding a surprising dose of laugh out loud humor, Johnson picks up where we left off and fills the screen and story with fabulous visuals and friends old and new. The actual plot, the basic good versus evil stuff, feels very fresh here, due, in part to the terrific actors embodying them, but also, dare I remind you, of the times we live in. And if you don’t get wrapped up in some of the handsomely staged battles or a few of the quieter moments, well, you probably weren’t paying attention. Admittedly, I can see where the mind might wander a bit. Running 2 hours and 32 minutes, this is still a long sit, as enjoyable as most of it is. Just make sure you prepare properly going in. Because the few sagging moments aren’t long enough for a bathroom break or popcorn refill. Daisy Ridley continues to impress as Rye, Oscar Issac and John Boyega are great fun as Poe and Finn. Adam Driver gets to do more this time around and he’s terrific. There are lots of familiar faces that show up, some we can see (Laura Dern, Benicio Del Toro), some rumored to be voicing Stormtroopers and such. The happiest addition is the dandy Kelly Marie Tran, the sweetest reunions are with Mark Hamill and, of course, Carrie Fisher, to whom the film is dedicated. There’ll be arguments as to which is the best Star Wars film. I’ll leave that to others. But I’m sure this one will be up there, sealing fates, opening doors and assuring The Force is with us."
"Dec 12, 2017",POSITIVE," Setting aside for the moment the spaceships and lightsabers and critters, Star Wars has always been about a few core ideas: the clash of evil Empire and mobilized do-gooders, the existence of a power greater than ourselves, the wars within and without ourselves, love and family. George Lucas’ multi-billion-dollar franchise has also told story after story about it always being darkest (or Dark Side-est) before the dawn. Technically, J.J. Abrams’ Episode VII—The Force Awakens was about all of the above as well, but it’s writer-director Rian Johnson who, with Episode VIII—The Last Jedi—better fulfills the promise of Lucas’ first subtitle: A New Hope. Johnson, who previously wrote and directed Looper and Brick, embraces the familiar obligations of a Star Wars movie while making a strong effort to trick audiences into sitting on the edges of their seats. Though no one would have wished it, he gets help in this regard from the untimely death of Carrie Fisher (who returns as Leia Organa, princess and general). On a first viewing, it’s hard not to watch The Last Jedi without constantly wondering how much more we’ll get of Fisher. It’s no spoiler to say that the filmmakers weren’t lying when they promised Fisher has a substantial role; in fact, the beloved Fisher gets to be the film’s font of centered wisdom, humor, and heart. By contrast, the other characters—with the exception of Andy Serkis’ wickedly confident uber-baddie Snoke—mostly live in self-doubt, fear, and desperation. These include Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the former tasked with returning the latter, “the last spark of hope,” to the scrappy Rebel resistance before it gets snuffed out by the empowered First Order. Luke, you see, is “the last Jedi” knight, and he’s determined to keep it that way, having been burned by personal failure. Will he get his Yoda on and train Rey? And what explains the cosmic connection of Rey, Luke, and the “raw, untamed power” that is First Order attack dog Kylo Ren (Adam Driver)? While that trio attends to the space-opera theatrics, the metaphysics and mystery, Rebel fighters Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac, still buddying up with cute droid BB-8), Finn (John Boyega), and welcome new face Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) get up to the usual space dogfights, behind-enemy-lines                                                                                                                          missions, and rebel stronghold defenses that keep Star Wars in eye-popping action. That’s as specific as I’ll get about the plot, which is best discovered in a movie theater. Suffice it to say that Johnson has happily recruited some bonus high-caliber acting support from Laura Dern and Benicio del Toro, and several familiar faces from previous Star Wars installments crop up in supporting roles or cameos. Johnson sticks with the Star Wars house style and seems pleased to have the opportunity to inspire children with this story of overcoming inner conflict to become one’s best self, the key ingredient being hope. The filmmaker injects his own personality and smarts with flippant visual and verbal humor (your mileage may vary) and a pinch of tart political commentary that, in hindsight, functions as a wink to the franchise’s own fiscal haul (one character explains, “There’s only one business in the galaxy that will get you this rich,” and another nods, “War”). Lucas quickly committed to the notion of rhyming Star Wars films, a tactic he used over the course of the original five sequels (in the musical vein, composer John Williams remains at it). Where Abrams’ The Force Awakens felt like A New Hope re-painted by numbers, Johnson’s The Last Jedi rhymes with The Empire Strikes Back in subtler ways, allowing for memorable new character dynamics, sights, and sounds assembled by a stellar team of motion-picture craftsmen dedicated to honoring the old while staying on the lightsaber’s cutting edge."
