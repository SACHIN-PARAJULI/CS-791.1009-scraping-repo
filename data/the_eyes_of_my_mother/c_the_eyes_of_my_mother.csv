"Oct 29, 2022",POSITIVE," Alright, beasties. It’s that time of year again. For this edition of Haunt-tober, I’m going to do a post a day but, like a great haul after trick or treating, I’m hoping to mix it up and deliver some surprises. There’ll be reviews, new or old, seen/unseen, TV or film. Depending on my wicked mood, there may also be lists, audio, or video. I hope you’ll enjoy it and remember: stay weird. A tragedy occurs and breaks up a family’s quiet, happy life. Young Francisca (Olivia Bond) is taught by her mother about human anatomy, which sparks a keen curiosity in her, but also an acceptance of life and death. When she gets older Francisca’s (Kika Magalhaes) interest grows in disturbing ways. The film chronicles her transition in a compelling, and sickening manner.  The film is only an hour and 16 minutes, yet each minute is felt. It’s not said as a negative, it’s just so heavy that you carry each scene with you as you go. It’s one of the oddest, but honestly, most impressive horror films I have seen in a long time. It manages to completely capture you, unnerve you, but also entrance you.  In stark black and white, there’s a foreboding cloud hanging over, and yet it is beautifully shot. The music is subtle and many scenes are filled with silence. Kika Magalhaes is fantastic, and stoic for most of the film, with moments where her facade breaks and the trauma and emotions overwhelm her. The film primarily takes in one location, a farmhouse in the middle of nowhere, and in ways, it feels like another world: Francisca’s. With no connection to anyone and a loneliness that pervades, she’s always yearning for the family she once had. The cinematography by Zach Kuperstein is also exquisite, heightening the sense of isolation.  The Eyes of My Mother is really one of a kind. It has a presence that doesn’t disappear when the credits roll. Each scene is meticulously crafted, and it is one where the atmosphere lives in you. A unique directorial debut that shouldn’t be overlooked.  We want to hear your personal, haunted/strange stories! Your fears/phobias… weird anecdotes! Tell us your favorite horrific film/tv show/book/collectible- anything!
If you’ve got something to share, I’d love to hear about it!
My only rules are to be kind. So, just be open and honest, and have fun!"
"Jan 14, 2022",POSITIVE,A bedtime freak-out fairy-tale for the genuinely disturbed
"Apr 28, 2021",POSITIVE,The way it twists and turns and follows this child's life as she leads into adulthood is very sickly entertaining.
"Mar 16, 2021",POSITIVE," Imagine you were stuck in a nightmare that you couldn’t wake up from. You try to wake up but no matter how hard you try, it’s futile. That is the experience of watching The Eyes of my Mother. It is probably one of the darkest and grim movies you will see all year. The movie begins with a young girl, Francesca, in the countryside who witnesses the brutal murder of her mother by a stranger she lets into her house. This event psychologically scars the girl in a huge way and we see that she gets older as the movie progresses. Her actions are to say the least are disturbing and that is an understatement. Saying what they are would be giving away too much but let’s just say it doesn’t involve giving flowers and making rainbows. Clocking in at 76 minutes, a length that so rare among feature films now but should be acceptable for some films, is a nuanced, beautiful film that deals with loss and death. That there is nothing after our last breath and that during our lives that grim reality is always present. Filming the movie in black and white was a great choice. There is no color both literally and metaphorically in the film. Kika Magalhaes (an actress who hasn’t really done anything of note yet) plays Francesca as an adult who still lives with her aging father. She gives a fantastic performance devoid of emotion and compassion. She plays the part so cold she could bring a new ice age. The way she says her lines has a unique, idiosyncratic cadence. However, it has to be stated Francesca is not a sympathetic character. She is a sad, pitiful person but nonetheless troubled human who makes reprehensible decisions. Don’t expect long, drowning lines of dialogue exposition. The movie has very little dialogue. When there is dialogue, mostly English is spoken but there are instances where characters speak in Portuguese. This is entirely a visual film where the story is moved by what happens in the scenes and not dialogue. It’s a great choice and more movies need to do this. During the press screening, four people walked out. This movie is not for everyone and it is going to cause disgust and resentment for some. Others will see a movie that opens a dialogue on the emptiness of life and death. It is going to stir emotions in everyone who sees it and it will not be a forgettable experience."
"Jul 3, 2020",NEGATIVE,"You can practically hear the filmmakers discussing what shocking event to include next. It tries very hard, with little larger understanding of why, and leaves lingering narrative holes."

"Apr 19, 2020",POSITIVE," A young woman is thought to handle dead bodies and see them as normal as well as operating on them.   After her mother is killed in their house, she slowly unravels and assumes things to be normal as she learns to live her new life. Written and directed by Nicolas Pesce, the entirety of the film revolves around one young woman and her descent into possible madness as she adapts to her surroundings from childhood and handles death in a particular manner into adulthood and life changes.  The lead character Pesce builds here is a disturbed young woman who does not know any better.  The way she goes through life, constantly referring to her death mother and trying to make her proud while doing things that most would consider twisted or wrong. His direction gives the story an almost completely even tone which is well represented in the black and white images which give a specific ambiance and the choice of using English and Portuguese language in the film to represent the lead’s relationships with different people and situation.  This gives the film an interesting personality and a vibe that is not often seen.  The film has a unique take on loneliness and adapting to one’s surroundings and changes. Cast in this lead of Francisca as a child is Olivia Bond who does well with the part of this growing girl who has a dark curiosity about life, death, and the body.  As adult Francisca, Kika Magalhaes gives a layered, mysterious, and nuanced performance.  She carries most of the film with other much smaller characters coming and going without much screen time compared to her. Some of these smaller characters do stand out such as Francisca’s mother played by Diana Agostini who shows a quiet strength and softness while teaching her child about eyeballs and how cows are similar to humans while cutting a cow’s eyeball out of its head.  Also needing to be noted is Will Brill as Charlie who will not be spoiled for those wanting to see the film, however it can be said that his performance has an interesting arc and a wide array of emotions which he handles with talent. Creating the look of the film is created by the black and white look that feels desolate in parts and lush in others and by the cinematography by Zach Kuperstein who frames the scenes and characters much like old school photography and would. This is also helped in terms of look by impeccable art direction by Caroline Keenan Russell and costumes design by Whitney Anne Adams, both of these create a cohesive look and give the film a somewhat timeless or period less style as they are from a not clearly identified period yet feel familiar and comfortable.  These paired with the music by Ariel Loh, create a whole that has a specific look, sound, and feel. The effects are also well done with some gruesome wounds, new and healing, done by Janine Maloney and Cat Martin.  In the film’s calm darkness and fairly subdued nastiness (if such a thing is possible), these effects add some surprise and almost dread. However, the horror of this film does not come from these specifically but from the lead and her closeness with death and pain and how she seems to be absolutely ok with it all. The Eyes of My Mother is beautiful exploration of how a person’s view of life, death, pain, and normalcy can be warped from a young age and the slow loss of connection to the real world by being cut off from it and building her own world with her own values and family.  This film is emotional while not being fully in your face about it and it is oddly touching."
"Oct 3, 2019",POSITIVE," If Portugal were the portal to some Lynchian netherworld of dreams deferred, it would look something like Nicolas Pesce’s sumptuously grotesque directorial debut, The Eyes of My Mother. A striking palette of black and white cinematography from Zach Kuperstein recalls the scarred, destitute lives from the ruins of Arturo Ripstein’s filmography, a macabre yet uncharacteristically sound portrait of psychological unraveling. We all know the kind of potent degeneration to be fashioned on isolated farmhouses where dysfunctional children are paired with musings of surgical practices, as seen in films from Haneke or even last year’s Goodnight Mommy. Pesce, who previously directed multiple music videos, as well as assistant editor on Josh Mond’s James White (2015), debuts a spectacularly gruesome calling card which may deconstruct the notion of the physical lens through which living beings observe the world, but seems to hint these particular organs are hardly inherent windows to the soul. At a secluded farmhouse, a weathered mother (Diana Agostini) teaches her young daughter Francisca (Olivia Bond) about anatomy and death, imparting all her knowledge and skill from her former life as a surgeon in Portugal. When a disturbed visitor (Will Brill) suddenly visits their farmhouse one day, Francisca’s idyllic childhood comes to a screeching halt. Left alone with her notably introverted father (Paul Nazak), Francisca grows into a young woman (Kika Magalhaes) with only a terrifying secret in the barn to call her friend. But as her father’s health deteriorates, Francisca becomes worried about who else will keep her company at the farm, and we begin to understand just how warped her worldview has become. The Eyes of My Mother begins with the kind of secret teased in The Secret in Their Eyes (2009/2015) and develops into what could have been a follow-up to The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane (1976). Pesce leads a deliberate pace through three chapters of little Francisca’s development, each ironically titled for a figure or notion we’re about to see perverted (Mother, Father, Family). Eventually we circle back to its opening moments, which hints at the young woman’s own background considering the advanced age of the actors portraying her parents. Kuperstein’s stark frames stray over the faded, grim interior of the farmhouse, moments of extreme violence edited by Pesce himself for a disturbing comical undercurrent for the fashioning of Francisca, who is eventually comparable to the sociopathic tendencies of any number of male serial killers haunting cultural periphery throughout history. The trio of producers Sean Durkin, Antonio Campos, and Josh Mond should clue you into what to expect from Pesce’s tone, which also recalls a variety of Euro filmmakers, from early Julio Medem to Lucia Puenzo’s The Good Doctor (aka Wakolda). But just when you think you can predict the gruesome inevitability of Pesce’s finale, he throws an unexpected curveball with its third segment, which asserts the narrative’s contemporary setting. There’s an otherworldliness here, as nothing seems to add up, such as where and when this is taking place, as well as why Francisca’s parents left Portugal and a lucrative profession behind. Kika Magalhaes is the breakout talent here as the grown Francisca, a woman whose loneliness is as understandable as her unconscionable actions are horrific. A bizarre aside where Francisca preys on a young English-speaking Asian woman she picks up at a place called “Donna’s Bar” (which reinforces a sort of “Twin Peaks” element of particular displacement where English is the primary language with a notably diverse characters) is particularly comedic, and says volumes of Francisca’s characterization as a predator who has only learned to be a victim of her own making. The idea of possessing and moulding another human being for one’s own disposal is the film’s dark heartbeat, and as the title indicates, Francisca’s warped worldview is filtered through problematic notions of death and dismemberment. The Eyes of My Mother announces Pesce as a particularly talented director to watch, securing him a reputable seat amongst his impressive group of producers.

"Jun 13, 2019",POSITIVE," Presented in black and white and set in – what looks to be – the 1950s, an innocent-looking farm house sits in the rolling hills of, possibly, the rural Midwest.  Oddly, Mother, who looks more like a grandmother with decades of angst and stress carried in her face, cuts open a cow’s eyeball at the kitchen table and explains its anatomy to Francisca, who hangs on every word.   Later that day, a strange man approaches the house, and unfortunately, Mother and Francisca do not heed the classic warning, “Don’t talk to strangers.” Trust me when I state that Francisca is immensely dangerous, and Pesce’s camera skillfully captures her exploits with – sometimes - a minimalist approach.   For instance, the audience may witness an act of violence from a noticeably distant point of view or just out of frame.  In one scene, we only see the aftermath of bloodshed during an “ordinary” moment of cleanup, due to the mess that was just enacted off camera.  Generally speaking, murderous close ups are not particularly necessary in an effective use of “less is more” in the horror genre, and I applaud it here.  On the other hand, immediate murder is not always Francisca’s modus operandi, and conversely, the film absolutely features the sickening sights and sounds from the results of her carefully crafted decisions. Pesce shoots his beautifully horrific creation with a distinct arthouse flair and constructs an isolated environment, in which no one can hear you scream and no one can see the merciless transgressions.  With a runtime of just 76 minutes, Pesce does not mince words or waste time with the narrative.  He does, however, hold the camera (in place) long enough during a number of ghastly sequences that will make you crave a shower after the film’s conclusion to wash away the vile nature of humanity that you just experienced as a semi-willing viewer.  At the same time, no mere antiseptic rinse can remove the portrait of woman - brought up in a wholly unhealthy environment - from one’s mind, as Francisca promises to slink into an accessible mental crawlspace. Loneliness may do strange things to the mind, but be warned: “The Eyes of My Mother” may trigger permanent damage.  Jeff – a member of the Phoenix Critics Circle – has penned film reviews since 2008 and graduated from ASU’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism.  Follow Jeff and the Phoenix Film Festival on Twitter @MitchFilmCritic and @PhoenixFilmFest, respectively.

"Jun 4, 2019",POSITIVE,"A haunting slow-burn of a film, one that eats its way under the skin with sadistic precision"
"Apr 10, 2019",POSITIVE,An exploration in isolation and the need for human contact lay the groundwork for this unnerving tale of loneliness.
"Nov 19, 2018",POSITIVE," Nicolas Pesce’s feature debut The Eyes of My Mother is stylishly shot in atmospheric black and white, an American Gothic horror with nightmarish scenes that stay imprinted on the mind’s eye. The black and white, stylised 1940s-noirish look of The Eyes of My Mother creates a feeling of dread right from the outset. In a long take, shot through the windscreen from the point of view of a trucker who’s listening to incongruously cheerful country music on the radio as he drives along an endless, deserted mid-West country road, a broken figure stumbles towards him and collapses. That’s the prologue teaser. The Eyes of My Mother is set on a remote farmhouse in a kind of retro rural America, where the era is cleverly fudged. It jumps in time between three sections over maybe ten or fifteen years. Nine-year-old Francisca (Olivia Bond) learns anatomy by dissecting a cow’s head with her Portuguese ex-eye surgeon mother in a scene reminiscent of Un Chien Andalou. They’re alone in the house when they are invaded by a passing psychopathic (Will Brill, smiling like an evangelist) and things quickly turn bad. He ends up chained naked in the adjoining cavernous barn. Skip forward a few years and Francisca as a young adult (Kira Magalães) is left alone when her father (Paul Nazak) dies. She goes to extraordinary lengths in not accepting it. Loneliness can do strange things to people, her mother said, and Francisca tries to fill a new need she feels for human company in the only way she has known when, leaving the farm it seems for the first time, she invites a young woman (Clara Wong) back one night. It’s a compelling central performance by Magalães, a Portuguese former dancer, whose body language conveys Francisca’s strangeness and isolation. She’s a monster yet she allows us to have some glimpses of sympathy at the dark places she takes us to. The black and white tones are sombre and the lighting is expressionistic. It’s like film noir meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre meets David Lynch’s Eraserhead. Dialogue is in both English and Portuguese, with vintage-appearance yellow subtitles. Long silent takes in long shot or through windows create the feeling of being an observer of events and the time to process the unthinkable horrors of kidnap, murder and mutilation happening out of shot. Music composed by Ariel Loh insistently ramps up the tension, interspersed with doleful Portuguese fado, the heritage of Francisca’s mother. Writer/director Nicolas Pesce’s impressive feature debut has some plot holes in hindsight but its stylish direction overrides them and suspends disbelief. The Eyes of My Mother creates a macabre world so taut and self-contained that events become terrifyingly unpredictable and it conjures up images that, once seen, can’t be unseen."
"Nov 2, 2018",NEUTRAL," A young girl learns about anatomy and death from her mother who was once an eye surgeon. After a strange man appears and brutally murders her mother, the girl grows up to have many morbid fascinations. The older the girl gets, the more she feels the need to live out these fascinations. She also increasingly has abandonment issues. Eventually the girl’s loneliness comes to a head, and her actions get out of hand. This is a film that is deeply morbid and visually stunning. The filmmakers chose to shoot the entire film in black and white. This decision adds not only to the unsettling images we see, but it also adds an artistic edge. If the film had been shot in color it would have taken the scenes from dark and beautiful to pure gore and carnage. The plot adds to the strange beauty by having a seemingly innocent girl at various stages of her life doing horrific things. Seeing what happened to her as a child makes you have a certain level of sympathy for the girl, but as time passes she becomes more and more deranged. It creates a very unsettling atmosphere (which, in a way, felt somewhat like the 2002 film May). While the film is generally interesting and beautiful, it felt like it was lacking a bit in substance. I’ve noticed a common theme among films that focus more on the style of the movie than the actual content. While The Eyes of My Mother falls in with these other films, it at least has enough of a plot to keep the audience intrigued. There are still many times where it felt like the film was moving slowly or there wasn’t anything going on. The fact this film is only about an hour and fifteen minutes long only further shows the lack of content. There are also actions taken by some of the characters that simply don’t make sense to me. For example, the actions taken by the father after the mother is killed are completely nonsensical. It is something you can imagine the daughter doing since she is deranged, but there is nothing in the character development that leads you to believe the father would choose this path. Much like with the plot, there is not a lot going on in terms of the acting. It makes it difficult to judge. There is really only one actor who has a substantial amount of content in the film. Kika Magalhaes (City of Gold) stars as Francisca. This is only the second role in a film for Magalhaes. Because she has few speaking parts it makes it somewhat difficult for me to critique her acting. I can say that Magalhaes succeeds on portraying a disturbing character with what seems like no conscious, while still making the audience feel sympathetic towards her. The other characters feel more like props in Francisca’s twisted little world. It is harder to appreciate the practical effects in this film since it is in black and white, but if you pay close attention you can really see how marvelously done they are. While the injuries on the victims are well done, what stands out to me comes before any of the injuries occur. In the beginning of the film, the mother teaches Francisca about anatomy (specifically of the eye) by dissecting a cow head. Even without the advantage of color you can still see how realistic the cow head and the removed cow eye are. It is also a bit of a fun anatomy lesson for those of us that aren’t as familiar with the anatomy of eyes. This is a film I don’t love, but I don’t hate it either. There always seems to be one film horror critics rave about that I just can’t get on board with. Sadly, this is that film. The Eyes of My Mother delivers on the creep factor as well as some disturbing images. The downside is that it lacks a bit in content and relies heavily on the images. There are some wise decisions made by the filmmakers, such as the use of black and white coloring. If the bloody mutilation had been in color, the film would have felt more like a B-movie than an artistic indie film. Either way, this is a film I would recommend people see at least once, but it doesn’t have great rewatchability. This was my favorite horror (and perhaps film) of the entire year. I would give it another watch, but appreciate you thoughts on it! Really enjoying your film reviews though, do you ever share your work on any other film sites? As of right now my written reviews are solely on this site but I do cohost a podcast (horrorheroes.com) where I discuss reviews with another horror critic. I will definitely revisit this film at some point. I appreciate what it was trying to achieve and it is a visual feast, it just may not be my cup of tea. "
"Nov 1, 2018",POSITIVE," Not all horror movies require moments of startling jump scares that slightly increase your heart rate for a brief moment to be effective. The Eyes of My Mother, the directorial debut of writer-director Nicolas Pesce, is an increasingly unsettling exercise in horror that never depends on the jump scares to emphasize its creepy material. Seemingly culled from history of infamous killers, The Eyes of My Mother features a lead character that feels like Ed Gein ventured into the field of optometry. As a young girl, Francesca (Olivia Bond) learned various lessons of anatomy and life from her mother (Diana Agostini), a former eye surgeon in Portugal. One day, a stranger (Will Brill) approaches their secluded rural home and proceeds to force his way into the home before killing the mother. When Francesca’s father (Paul Nazak) returns home, he beats the stranger and leaves him bloodied in their barn where young Francesca becomes infatuated with the beaten man, using his body as a living cadaver to continue her lessons in anatomy. As she gets older, Francesca (now played by Kika Magalhaes) grows increasingly lonely as her elderly father has passed. Now Francesca goes out of her way to find new reluctant companions to ease the growing feelings of loneliness. Pesce’s film isn’t a movie of unrelenting tension, but the unease it invokes in its viewers is unrelenting. The black and white cinematography of Zack Kuperstein and the sparse musical score Ariel Loh lend a creepy atmosphere to the escalating horrors that Francesca perpetrates. Those atrocities aren’t excessively gore for the queasy horror fan nor are they exactly tame, but Pesce strikes a deft balance between leaving horror to the imagination and providing the audience glimpses of the ghastly terror. The Eyes of My Mother doesn’t waste a minute of its sparse running time as Nicolas Pesce crafts a piece of horror that is atmospheric and unsettling throughout and always willing to take its story in unexpected places. What really makes The Eyes of My Mother so unsettling is the innocence that Kika Magalhaes brings to the role of Francesca. It’s one thing when you’re dealing with an evil that understands itself to be evil, but Francesca has a child-like mentality that only finds comfort and friendship through sadistic forms of anatomical exploration. The movie operates as a character study in the aching loneliness that defines Francesca’s life from the day that stranger arrived onward, and without a healthy outlet for her feelings of solitude leads the character into the darkest recesses of her mind. As Francesca descends further and further away from reality and morality the film takes a darker and darker turn leading to a shocking final act that is simply chilling. The Eyes of My Mother is a standout piece of horror filmmaking and a standout directorial debut for Nicolas Pesce. It marks one of the most unsettling pieces of horror to grace the screen in 2016 with moments that leave a gruesome mark on your mind. There are moments from The Eyes of My Mother that I’ll have a hard time forgetting. But more so, I’ll be anxiously looking forward to what Nicolas Pesce has to offer in the future. Creepy and increasingly unsettling, The Eyes of My Mother is an assured directorial debut by Nicolas Pesce that escalates in its unease as it follows a lonely and disturbed protagonist. This here writing represents a symbol of Sean Mulvihill's individuality, and his belief in personal freedom. He's also a hack writer who drinks too much and falls in love with girls."
"Oct 5, 2018",POSITIVE," Goodness is this film gruesome. There’s death, there’s torture, there’s kidnapping, there’s psychosis—and it’s all elegantly framed and put together with a tastefulness that seems at odds with the story. Furthermore, what violence occurs is always in the periphery and never committed in front of us. We can hear, though, and for this film that’s enough. Especially with so many being blinded and silenced, it is apt that we are left blind and silent, and yet constantly aware of the horror never being far away. It’s completely effective. It’s unnerving. And I thought it was scarier than any cheap surprise could achieve. What is this about, though? With its rather short running time, it seemed to end just as soon as it could begin, but I do like the interpretation that it wants to humanise someone who would otherwise be written off as a monster. When family is all you have, and its suddenly taken from you, the shock of loneliness can be too much to bear. And if you don’t know a healthy way to cope, I would imagine something like this would not be an improbable occurrence. It’s definitely a weird film to end off the year with, but hey, at least I can spend New Year’s Eve being appreciative that my family is still with me, right?"
"Aug 25, 2018",POSITIVE," More a mood piece than a tightly constructed narrative, The Eyes of My Mother is a horror film that plays back like a half-forgotten memory. Through their remarkable collaboration, Magalhaes and Pesce grant a vague sense of empathy to acts and decisions on Francisca’s part that are – at a distance, at least – wholly incomprehensible, unambiguously unforgivable. Evoking Richard Brooks’s 1967 film In Cold Blood (itself an adaptation of Truman Capote’s iconic book of the same name published the year before) and another cult true crime film, Leonard Kastle’s The Honeymoon Killers (1970), there is something about The Eyes of My Mother that acts as a powerful antidote to the now past-tense so-called “torture porn” cycle. Perhaps inadvertently, it reclaims something of what was lost with those films in terms of energy, sincerity and a sense of genuine tragedy, recalling with in its fusion of beauty and horror earlier gore classics like Tobe Hooper’s The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)."
"Aug 20, 2018",POSITIVE," The Eyes Of My Mother is a very stylish and at times stylised film. It’s a disturbing tale of a daughter’s quest to replace the maternal love so brutally taken from her by a serial killer at a young age. The events that take place in the film are horrifying but does this qualify it as a horror, not quite. The Eyes Of My Mother is the debut feature by writer/director, Nicolas Pesce and he does an admirable job. The decision to shoot the entire film in black and white is what raises it above mediocrity and sets the tone for the film. Also, the principal actress, Kiki Magalhaes is convincing for the most part as the adult although as the film reaches its climax she becomes too self aware. That would be my sole criticism of this film for all its beautiful cinematography and interesting play with the genre, it is just too self aware. Watching the film you sense that Pesce wants you to think isn’t this clever and look how I inverted what usually happens in a horror e.g. near the beginning you think a character will be killed but isn’t. It’s acceptable to employ the misdirection technique but sparingly. In this film it happens far too frequently. The Eyes of My Mother is following the trends of other recent horror films that place maternal love at the heart of the film – Under The Shadow and Babadook. Those films the mother is very much present whereas in The Eyes Of My Mother it’s the loss of the maternal figure that plays the pivotal role. We hope you're enjoying BRWC.

"Dec 28, 2017",POSITIVE," It’s exceedingly rare for a filmmaker to present a deeply disturbed individual on the big screen, one who partakes in all sorts of grotesqueness, whose mind is one of deranged abandon and necrophile-longing, and somehow manages to portray not only what is repulsive, reprehensible and extraordinarily transgressive, but to pertain and touch upon a profound existential beauty. It was the Romantics who found as their creed the idea that often beauty and truth can only be arrived at through the experiencing of terror.The Eyes of My Mother is therefore something of a Romantic horror masterpiece travelling the same crazy and psychologically frenzied road to enlightenment. Fronted by Kika Magalhaes, which, if there’s any justice in the world, would prove to be a star-making breakout role, The Eyes of My Mother is told in three chapters – Mother, Father, Family – and details the life of a young woman left to her own devices on a farm. Like Michael Apted’s Nell crossed with the notorious life and times of Ed Gein, Francisca (Magalhaes) is neither Keats’s la belle sans merci nor an unsympathetic, one-dimensional monster."
"Nov 12, 2017",POSITIVE," First-time writer-director Nicolas Pesce can look forward at age twenty-six to fairly original contributions to fans of horror who, at the same time, have the necessary patience to sit through a lyricism that makes a serial killer almost likable.  While you may compare parts of the plot to events in the “Saw” series, primarily the frequent use of chains to keep a psycho’s prey in place in the basement, “The Eyes of My Mother” is several levels higher.  In fact, you’re likely to consider the young woman’s mom as a being with as much influence on her daughter, though dead, as influenced Norman Bates in Alfred Hitchcock’s 1960 “Psycho.” The action begins with a foreshadowing: a truck driver finds a woman not simply taking a chance on hitching a ride on a lonely highway but lying down in front of his truck to increase her odds of rescue.  Go back to Portuguese-American Francisca at about the age of ten, listening intently to the words of wisdom passed down from her mother (Diana Angostini).  Even the mother’s dissection on the kitchen table of the eye of a cow might remind viewers of a similar incident in Luis Buñuel’s “Un chien andalou.”  At the same time she absorbs lessons on the importance of kindness by the mother’s teaching of the life of St. Francis of Assissi, important in justifying the way that the daughter will respond even to the captives in her basement. You need not look far to see how young Francisca loses her marbles, as she witnesses the brutal murder of her mother by a crazed man, Charlie (Will Brill), whom she reluctantly but stupidly allows into her farmhouse to “use the rest room.”  Francisca is fond as well, of her father (Paul Nazak). Go forward a few years and now Francisca (Kika Magalhaes), painfully lonely, seeks people to share her life, but is more than disappointed when they are unable to commit to the attention she seeks.  As the tension slowly mounts, so do the bodies. This slasher picture is filmed in black and white, presumably to further its arty credentials, and takes itself most seriously.  There is no attempt at camp, irony or humor, nor should the film need those periods of comic relief. The soundtrack, not intrusive, delivers buzzing and the sounds of wind, plus several bits of Portuguese fado to allow Francisca to perform solitary dances.  English is the principal language spoken, the few segments of Portuguese nicely subtitled in English with bright yellow characters.

"Jun 13, 2017",POSITIVE,"It is an extremely moving film, and brutally exposes the damage we as people can easily inflict upon one another."
"Jun 12, 2017",NEUTRAL,"This debut from Nicolas Pesce is tense and creepy, but also mannered and, ultimately, little more than pompous torture porn: a film for fans of horrible things being done to humans in artful close-up."
"Apr 26, 2017",POSITIVE," Francisca (Olivia Bond and later Kika Magalhães) grows up on an isolated cattle farm that might have once been painted by Edward Hopper. As a hobby, her Portuguese mother (Diana Agostini), a former surgeon, practises dissection on the cows and tells ominous tales concerning St Francis of Assisi. The family patriarch (Paul Nazak) is the silent type. One day, an odd stranger called Charlie (Will Brill) insinuates his way into the homestead. The brutal crime he commits heralds a cycle of graphic, violent acts that come to define this discombobulating American gothic. Working with cinematographer Zach Kuperstein, video director Nicolas Pesce has fashioned a horrible, beautiful thing: an art-horror, pitched, atmospherically, somewhere between Ana Lily Amirpour's A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night and Charles Laughton's The Night of the Hunter. Striking monochrome tableaux, minimal dialogue, empty rooms, Ariel Loh’s sinister, droning score, and a freakily intense central performance from Portuguese actor, Kika Magalhães, create a sensation of creeping dread that keeps pace with flinch-making nightmarish spectacle. Speaking in a mix of Portuguese and English, and moving almost robotically, Magalhães conveys the darkest kind of disassociation. Strange truncations and ill-defined motivations reduce the uneasy viewer to a fugue state and leave spaces to imagine much worse things, if indeed things can be much worse than what we do see. One has to hope that The Eyes of My Mother's generic underpinnings and gruesome leanings won't alienate the arthouse crowd, and equally, that the film's stately pacing and aesthetic rigour won't deter horror enthusiasts. The running time – or lack thereof – is a problem, but this otherwise perfectly ghoulish exercise marks Nicolas Pesce and his crew as talents to keep track of."
"Mar 30, 2017",NEGATIVE," Subverting and switching the expectations of a genre can make for thrilling cinema, but merely shooting in black and white and slowing down the pace does not alone a good film make. Nicolas Pesce’s directorial debut dresses a torture-porn horror in a stylish arthouse cover which, intriguing as this mash-up sounds, results in something that leaves both these aspects fully unrealised. There’s a lot of ideas in the film – just don’t ask me what any of them were supposed to be. Deeply disturbing, and with just enough visual tantalisations to boast the director’s skill, The Eyes of My Mother is a film that only few could enjoy, or at very least stomach. Divided into three chapters, we first meet a young Francisca living on an isolated farm with her mother (Dianna Agostini), a former surgeon from Portugal, with a particular penchant for removing cows’ eyeballs. Their quiet lives are interrupted one day by a travelling salesman (Will Brill) with more than commission on his mind, sharply turning the film in a violent and upsetting direction. From there on in, torture, mutilation and death become the norm for the now grown Francisca (Kika Magalhaes), whose yearning for companionship is constantly overridden by her deep fear of the unknown world outside the farmyard and her lingering murderous urges. For his first feature film, Pesce handles his content with the confidence of a much more seasoned director. Shots are well composed, the movement is smooth, except in places where it is not supposed to be, and he uses the limited colour palette of the monochrome cinematography to its full advantage. Where the film really stands strong, however, is its atmosphere. A consistent level of dread maintained from the first shot. The structure of the film ensures that we are only granted small glances at any one point into the character’s life. And yet, even before the real horror begins, there is a sense that something is not quite right with this family, that there is something strange in their attitude to violence which ultimately informs the person Francisca grows up to be. The problem is a lot of the issues raised in the film are only ever half-explored. The time-jumps mean that we never really get see the inner-workings of Francisca’s mind or any hint as to her true motivations. Pesce proves that that the inter-mingling of arthouse compositions and classic horror tropes can work on a visual level, but he still has some work to do proving that in can work on a narrative level as well. While it is clear that the alienation of the audience from the events on screen was purposeful to a degree, it can also make at times for a tedious watch. At only 77 minutes long the film does not overstay its welcome, but the abrupt ending give rise to the question whether time wasted on duller moments could have been better utilised for a more substantial climax. Overall, this is a film that will appeal to fans of horror and the non-squeamish. At the very least this chilling piece of cinema should be acknowledged for deviating from the norm and showing that horror on film should not be confined to cheap jump-scares. However, while diversity in classic genres should be encouraged, it is important to remember that ‘different’ does not always equate to ‘better’."
"Mar 27, 2017",NEUTRAL," When genre maestro John Carpenter was asked what makes an effective horror film, he pithily answered, “It should be scary.” This may seem reductive, but watching Nicolas Pesce’s insipid The Eyes of My Mother, it’s clear that some directors should make sure they’ve mastered the basics before they try to do something new within the genre. This debut feature is about a girl, Francisca (played by Olivia Bond and Kika Magalhaes), who descends into a life of madness and gruesome violence after witnessing her mother butchered by a crazed travelling salesman (Will Brill). The film is shot in black-and-white and there are plenty of great macabre compositions, including a particularly striking one of a cow’s head on a table. But the decision to film in monochrome signals that perhaps Pesce wasn’t entirely certain whether he wanted to make a traditional hair-raising thriller, or a more stylised art-house chiller. In the end he doesn’t really achieve either. One of the most problematic aspects of this film is its inconsistent pacing. The opening sequence feels rushed, as the mother is hacked to pieces before any tension is built up. The way the story initially unfolds cultivates the expectation that this will be a psychological mediation on how trauma can transform a victim into a callous murderer. Instead, Pesce gives his characters unconvincing motivations such as when one says of killing that it, “feels amazing”. And while there’s a twisted Freudian logic behind the maternal instincts Francisca displays towards her mother’s killer, this point is so heavy-handed that it completely diminishes any broader impact. And for all the nightmarish potential of this story, the actors appear to be serenely sleepwalking in their parts. The detached, almost inhuman performances succeed at times in lending an eeriness to the film, but there’s something risible rather than haunting in the monotone delivery of a line such as, “I killed [my father]”.

"Mar 26, 2017",NEUTRAL," This poised feature debut from Nicolas Pesce announces a director who blends arthouse with horror to unnerving, elegant effect. Shot in striking black and white with a camera that drifts, almost languidly, to reveal hints of nightmarish violence, there is a chilly beauty to the austere backwoods America backdrop. A child, home-schooled in dissection and the mysteries of anatomy by her mother, puts her skills into practice when a violent tragedy rends her life apart. Later, as a lonely young adult, Francisca (Kika Magalhães) sets about creating her own family unit by – literally – carving chunks off someone else’s. The film loses some of its cruel precision and restraint in a third act that goes all out for shock value. As a result, the picture ends up more conventional and less intriguing than its early promise suggested."
"Mar 24, 2017",NEUTRAL," In their secluded farmhouse, a mother (a former surgeon) teaches her daughter, Francisca, anatomy, and how life and death are not to be feared. One afternoon, a mysterious visitor shatters the idyll of their family life, and deeply traumatises Francisca, but also awakens curiosities. Years later, Francisca clings to her increasingly distant father, but the trauma she sustained reawaken when her desire to connect with the world around her takes on a dark form. Writer/director Nicolas Pesce makes an accomplished transition from music videos with this darkly disturbing slice of American Gothic that wears its debts to Charles Laughton's The Night of the Hunter (1955) and Victor Erice's The Spirit of the Beehive (1973) with quiet pride. Divided into three chapters, the story charts how the murder of her Portuguese surgeon mother (Diana Agostini) impacts upon a young farm girl (played variously by the creepily angelic Olivia Bond and gracefully gruesome dancer Kika Magalhäes), whose outward innocence masks a chillingly logical cruelty. The lilting Amália Rodrigues fados on the soundtrack and the beauty of Zach Kuperstein's widescreen monochrome imagery belie the brutality of action that (thanks to Michael Kurihara's sound work) is definitely not for the squeamish. But, despite the hideous fates that befall homicidal salesman Will Brill, Japanese student Clara Wong and young mother Flora Diaz, this teasingly elliptical melodrama is more a psychological study of loneliness and the need for love than it is a generic shocker."
"Mar 23, 2017",NEUTRAL," ★★★☆☆ At a farmhouse in rural Virginia, a creepy stranger calls and asks to use the bathroom. You fear the worst for the inhabitants of the house: young Francisca and her Portuguese mother. The worst duly comes to her mother, an event that understandably leaves its mark on Francisca."
"Mar 23, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Doesn't hang together in entirely satisfying ways, but its odd camera angles, minimal dialogue and gory compositions do build towards a chilly exploration of the detrimental effects of isolationism that feels strangely timely."
"Mar 21, 2017",POSITIVE,"With The Eyes of My Mother, Pesce explores the nature of human instinct and arrested development in a way that is uncomfortable to watch yet immersive just the same."
"Mar 21, 2017",NEUTRAL," Opting to focus more on building a foreboding mood over an engaging narrative, debut film-maker Nicolas Pesce delivers an austere, redolent debut feature which slightly stirs and disturbs at times but, at a slender seventy six minutes, it is still often shockingly monotonous. The story (broken down into chapters) focuses on a young girl called Francisca (Olivia Bond): a shy child who lives an isolated, tranquil existence on a remote Portuguese farm with her mother (Diana Agostini) and father (Paul Nazak). Until the day a tormented passer-by, posing as a salesman (Will Brill), enters their lives and adjusts the family dynamics. TEOMM unravels with the air of an art-house torture porn b-movie/ graduate film, captured in mucky black and white for extra gothic gravitas, Pesce’s film fails to crack into its protagonist or excavate enough emotion to enrich the narrative. Pesce reduces his audience to the role of passive observers, subjecting them to various acts of full blown, bloody, black and white brutality but anyone seeking anything emotionally enrapturing will be bitterly disappointed. Aside from stirring aesthetically by way of its haunting vistas, TEOMM is an endurance test and will be worse for non- horror fans/ those impartial to angry splats of guts and claret. Upsetting scenes of death and torture wantonly unfurl as the story charts Francisca’s growth from childhood into adolescence (as an adult she is played by Kika Magalhaes) before she buds into a sociopath. Her mental affliction flourishes to form a fractured personality but there isn’t much of a narrative to gild the emotional beats or an astute enough arc to truly engage. TEOMM’s inability to burrow deep beneath its protagonist’s surface, combined with several taxing moments of Noir bloodshed, makes TEOMM an often unsettling experience. Francisca cares for a dubious choice of pet, keeps the dead body of a family member close by for comfort (bathing and watching TV with them) and kills without remorse or forethought. Francisca had an early, direct exposure to bodily repugnance, due to her mother being a surgeon, so is (like most horror fans) desensitised to the slaughter. TWOMM  is not sure whether it wants to be an artistic character study or murder/horror movie. It partly succeeds as both due to great performances, but not enough happens for it to engage on an emotional, intellectual level and its lack of plot should have been compensated with more focused drama and insane, adventurous horror. What follows instead is a part thriller/relationship drama/character study as Francisca grows into womanhood before it drives her head first into blood caked social conundrums. TEOMM is a trying watch with brief snippets of visual brilliance (nice bleak photography), neutered by elongated mood defining and superficial drama. It is genuinely unsettling at times though with enough gruelling horror to suggest Pesce could go on to craft much better work as TEOMM is far from generic but the script is stretched and underdeveloped. At 76 minutes though, it still seems too long but this debut feature could’ve made an awesome short and (from a visual perspective) is a unique calling card for Pesce as a director."
"Mar 20, 2017",NEUTRAL," Yes, here's this week's new releases. Click on for our reviews of The Lost City of Z, Power Rangers, Aquarius, Life, The Age of Shadows, All This Panic, The Eyes of My Mother, Another Mother’s Son, CHiPs, and All Governments Lie. Anyone missing Indy could get their explorer fix from this engaging jungle adventure, featuring undiscovered treasure and close calls with indigenous people. Only this is less a Boy’s Own romp, more an elegant study of endurance and obsession, based on real events. In fact, it’s thought the intrepid cartographer followed here, Percy Fawcett, inspired the creation of the famous Fedora-wearer – it’s easy to understand the fascination based on James Gray’s (We Own the Night, Two Lovers) evocative, immersive biopic. We meet Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) in 1905 at a crossroads: a capable colonel in the British Army hamstrung by what an elitist old fart describes as an “unfortunate choice of ancestors”. To progress, he takes a two-year Royal Geographical Society (RGS) expedition to map the Bolivia-Brazil border, leaving his patient missus (Sienna Miller, radiant) behind and teaming up with a wookiee-like fellow cartographer, Costin (Robert Pattinson and his immense beard). The punishing journey, both mentally and physically, is heaven/hell – complete with horrific piranha attacks, starvation, terrifying tribal run-ins and a bonkers fever dream of an opera in the middle of the jungle. And this odyssey is the nucleus of Fawcett’s lifelong passion for finding evidence of a lost civilisation he calls ‘Z’, as well as the push-pull between family life and the call of the Amazon. Charting Fawcett’s heroic adventures over several expeditions, his involvement in WW1 and his spats with the stuffy RGS, Z muses on themes of elitism, patrimony, gender equality and destiny, via Gray’s poignant screenplay and Darius Khondji’s truly beautiful cinematography. Aside from niggles that characters discuss world events with a knowing prescience (“There could be another war…”), Z guides viewers on their own journey through exhilaration, trepidation, wonderment and ultimately, faith. Key to that arc is the triumvirate of Hunnam (exuding decency and charisma from every pore), Pattinson (bringing wry comedic timing and the voice of sanity to proceedings) and Miller, once again giving great wife (see American Sniper, Foxcatcher). The fact she’s a fully developed character, that family sacrifice and the resentment fostered by absentee fathers is given as much credence as the derdoing, provides refreshing modernism. The result is an emotionally satisfying experience – and one that’ll have you googling Fawcett as soon as the lights are up. It’s those nuances of script and performance that also ensure the devastating impact of the ambiguous, beautiful finale, a sequence with Hunnam as rhapsodical as any Malick movie and a final shot with Miller that’s both haunting and strangely uplifting. There’s a fundamental misjudgement at the heart of Power Rangers, the latest franchise wannabe. It takes a property that could never be cool to anyone over the age of 12, and stuffs it to the gills with Breakfast Club-style teen angst. It’s impossible to fathom who it’s actually aimed at: too dull for kids seeking superhero thrills, too lame for anyone who might actually be in a position to relate to its protagonists. The borderline-edgy leads comprise fallen sports hero Jason (Zac Efronalike Dacre Montgomery), “on the spectrum” Billy (Me & Earl’s RJ Cyler), ostracised cool girl Kimberly (Naomi Scott), surly Trini (Becky G.) and Zack (Ludi Lin), whose characterisation extends to having a sick mother. Jason, Billy and Kimberly meet in Saturday detention, crossing paths with the others at the site where Zordon (Bryan Cranston) – one of the original prehistoric alien Rangers from the Cenozoic era – buried crystals that’ll give the new chosen ones powers. Reincarnated as a disembodied mentor, Cranston suffers the indignity of acting through a lousy visual effect that’s basically a large-scale version of those pin-art contraptions you pressed your face into as a kid. As well as receiving trite nuggets of mentor wisdom, the gang’s training only really covers performing suplexes. It’s not entirely without merit. Director Dean Israelite (Project Almanac) flaunts visual panache with a spinning 360-degree view from inside a car during a chase, while the team of photogenic outcasts aren’t entirely charmless, with Cyler getting most of the laughs. It also takes commendable baby steps towards being a more progressive superhero film, and includes a casual reference to one character’s non-heterosexuality. But any potential warmth is derailed with some misfiring decisions, including two-too-many wanking gags and an act of revenge porn that’s shrugged off as character building. For viewers of a certain age, there will possibly be pangs of involuntary nostalgia when (finally) it’s morphin’ time: like the TV series, there’s a cheap-looking fight in a quarry. But by this point, it’s hard to feel invested in the stakes. Elizabeth Banks’ hammy baddie Rita Repulsa feels like she’s been transplanted from an entirely different, younger-skewing film, and the mythology feels not so much half-baked as raw. When the indistinguishable Zords assemble for some sub-par Bayhem, the budget VFX struggle to conjure much excitement.  It’s a meh climax to a reboot that feels misguided: when your film has such egregious product placement that Krispy Kreme becomes the source of all power in the universe, the buck has to stop somewhere. When property developers target Aquarius, the beloved seaside apartment building of retired music critic and cancer survivor Clara (Sonia Braga), she refuses to move. As fellow tenants, and Clara’s own family, get antsy about missing their big payday, the developers begin a campaign of psychological – and surreal – intimidation to force Clara to change her mind. A major talking point in its native Brazil, Kleber Mendonça Filho’s follow-up to Neighbouring Sounds (2012) packs a punch beyond its controversial critique of how greed and gentrification have usurped community values. That’s chiefly down to a career-best Braga (Kiss of the Spider Woman), whose fearless turn as a pensionable social-justice warrior is riveting. The film looks and feels like a disquieting thriller, with lurid imagery of orgies and infestations, and an oppressive sound design that lends a siege mentality to proceedings. Trouble is, nobody’s told Clara this is meant to be a bleak, Michael Haneke-esque genre workout. With an unquenchable, devil-may-care spirit, she steadies the tension, restores her pride, and takes back control. For all the film’s asides about a corrupt, divided society, there’s an optimism to Clara’s stubborn defence. Through the story’s languid drift, Mendonça accumulates so many details of Aquarius’ history – as a place to live, love and laugh – that you won’t want it destroyed, either. “That’s some Re-Animator shit!” declares Ryan Reynolds’ mouthy merc, sorry mechanic, Roy, when a team of six scientists in an orbiting space station prod a mollusc from Mars to life, while the other crew members (Jake Gyllenhaal’s world-weary war vet, Rebecca Ferguson’s pragmatist, Ariyon Bakare’s naive lab rat) coo at its ‘beauty’ and look at him blankly. There’s no getting around that Deadpool writers Reese and Wernick are indebted to Ridley Scott’s space game-changer, from premise to unfolding death-lottery and physically invasive offings. And the fact that Scott’s incoming re-animation of the franchise looks like it’ll follow all the same beats makes Life seem largely surplus to requirement. But in the hands of an accomplished cast (Gyllenhaal brings particular pathos), nimble scriptwriters (neither dumb nor Solaris portentous) and Daniel Espinosa’s (Safe House) brisk, taut direction, Life nips along with enough suffocating tenseness and bleak twists within an arse-friendly running time to ensure its validity. Inventive action and tangled morals are the keynotes of this thriller, set in Japanese-occupied 1920s Korea. Lee Jung-chool (Song Kang-ho) is a Korean-born Japanese cop sent to infiltrate pro-independence agitators. Shot over a three-year period, this fleet-footed coming-of-age documentary from debut director Jenny Gage follows the lives of a group of middle-class teenage girls in Brooklyn, as they navigate their way from adolescence to adulthood. Caught between art cinema and torture porn, debut writer/director Nicolas Pesce’s B&W horror stars Kika Magalhaes as a young woman who cuts out people’s eyes then keeps them as pets. Immaculately poised but almost completely pointless, it moves from chin-strokingly pretentious to profoundly depressing. Only one scene with a baby haunts both mind and retina. This WW2 drama finds a fresh angle: it’s set in Jersey, the only British territory to fall to the Germans. The solemn score, plucky Brits and nasty Nazis are all familiar, but there’s a lived-in feel that transcends cliché. The target audience for this infantile action-comedy, written, directed by and starring Dax Shepard has probably never seen the original ’70s-’80s TV show about California motorcycle cops. Not that it matters, with nostalgia giving way to crotch humour as Shepard’s ex-dirt-bike star and Michael Peña’s undercover agent smoke out LAPD corruption. All hot wheels and dick jokes, it’s fun but forgettable. This doc exposes mainstream-media collusion with porky-telling politicians, while celebrating the rare reporters who evoke the spirit of I.F.

"Mar 20, 2017",NEUTRAL,A poised and meticulously controlled slice of American gothic that blends together a slew of influences from Hitchcock to Haneke via David Lynch and The Night of the Hunter.
"Mar 16, 2017",POSITIVE,"The Eyes of My Mother is perhaps most haunting when it points out how simple it would be to skew a child's moral compass, or how ridiculous the idea of closure is in terms of a horror film."
"Feb 27, 2017",POSITIVE,More arthouse than horror...
"Jan 27, 2017",POSITIVE,"As this generation's version of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, the movie provides something I've seen on few occasions in cinema."
"Jan 19, 2017",NEGATIVE,"I suppose that fans of horror films might like this, but I sure could not see any point to it."
"Jan 8, 2017",POSITIVE,A homage intent on weaving its influences into its mesmerising and melancholy brand of horror brooding.
"Jan 2, 2017",POSITIVE," The Eyes of My Mother contains more grotesque imagery than the average horror film, so there is a temptation to classify it under the “body horror” subgenre. Such a label does the film a disservice, however, since all the transgressive violence deepens a probing, heartfelt psychological study about the effects of profound loneliness. In his directing and writing debut, Nicolas Pesce strikes a grim balance between disgust and sympathy and takes his premise to its inexorable conclusion.  The action largely takes place around a farmhouse, in an unspecified time during the mid-20th century. The titular mother (Diana Agostini) is a Portuguese-American immigrant, as well as a former surgeon, and she uses livestock to give her young daughter Francisca (Olivia Bond) anatomy lessons. The pair receive a visit from Charlie (Will Brill), a man who claims to be a salesman but turns out to be a sadistic killer. Francisca’s father (Paul Nazak) catches Charlie violating his wife’s corpse, and his sense of vengeance is ice-cold: he chains Charlie in a barn, cuts out his eyes and tongue, and keeps him alive for years. This early trauma shapes Francisca’s life—Kika Magalhaes plays her as an adult—so we watch her undergo extreme steps to deal with her sense of isolation. Pesce and cinematographer Zach Kuperstein use crisp, evocative black and white photography. This gives The Eyes of My Mother a timeless quality and offers the audience a mild reprieve from the gore. In addition to torture, Francisca develops a taste for murder, preferring to commune with bodies rather than people. Like the most memorable movie monsters, however, Pesce makes sure we understand that Francisca is fighting against her dark impulses—a fight she ultimately loses. There is a strange, sad sequence where she picks up a woman at a bar and takes her home. Francisca has the desire for intimacy, yet is so woefully out of practice that when the woman realizes something is wrong, Francisca feels her only recourse is violence. We have no choice but to recognize her perspective better than those of her victims. In terms of horror, Pesce opts for gnawing dread over “gotcha” scares. He gets a lot of mileage out of filming Charlie, writhing on the floor without the ability to speak or see, as if to invite us to imagine what he could possibly be thinking. The compositions are elegant, with minimal camera movement, a technique that only adds to the dread. A more dynamic, subjective filmmaking style might be more immersive, yet Pesce would rather engage our imagination, not exploit it. The actors are key to this effect. The victims are convincing and ordinary, while Brill’s turn as Charlie is frightening because his self-effacing delivery betrays a deep psychosis. Still, The Eyes of My Mother would fall apart without Magalhaes’ performance. She plays Francisca as a woman who only understands extremes—profoundly lonely, yet without any resources to address her feelings. Despite few lines of dialogue, Magalhaes never takes the easy route, so compassion never veers toward pity. This film is not a voyeur to Francisca’s crimes because Pesce’s camera is its own form of commentary. There is a long, strange shot where the camera is attached to a tarp that Francisca’s mother drags (young Francisca watches this all unfold, naturally). There are flashes of the outside world and civilization, yet Pesce cuts away from anything reasonable because that would distract from his slow push toward abject madness. The Eyes of My Mother has an ending, as it must, but Pesce prefers no catharsis. He puts Francisca on a disturbing path, and after asking us to share it, he realizes the only way to stop her is cutting her off at the knees. There are no answers, only the demand that we find empathy for someone who perpetrates  decades of suffering. We don't have one. Readers like you keep our work free for everyone to read.

"Dec 23, 2016",NEGATIVE," Jackie has a brilliant performance surrounded by an otherwise unremarkable movie. Natalie Portman is amazing as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, depicted at a handful of different points in time before and after JFK’s assassination—it’s probably the best performance of her career, and most likely the best cinematic representation of Jackie O. The movie itself, though, doesn’t provide a lot of insight beyond Jackie herself. The film leans heavily on the notion that things in the Camelot era were often stage-managed and exaggerated, which at this point in history isn't a revelation. And we don't get much light shed on the rest of the characters that hasn't already been gleaned from the hundreds of books and dozens of movies already made about the era in the last 50-plus years. Jackie is not an expansive, life-spanning biopic, but rather focuses on a handful of specific moments. The framing device is Jackie Kennedy, shortly after the president’s death, interviewed by a Life magazine journalist (Billy Crudup) who is supposed to be Theodore White, although he's unnamed. (Between that and the Michael Shannon scene in Loving, it’s a great year for the 1960s legacy of Life magazine.) We see her in the closer, immediate aftermath of the assassination, with Robert Kennedy (Peter Sarsgaard) and Lyndon Johnson (John Carroll Lynch). And there are flashbacks to Jackie’s White House years, with Portman re-enacting famous footage of Kennedy showing off her decorating choices. Jackie was directed by Pablo Larraín, the Chilean filmmaker who previously made 2012’s No—about the campaign that ultimately removed Pinochet from office in the director’s homeland—and this year’s Pablo Neruda biopic Neruda. He also made the 2008 film called Tony Manero, about a Chilean man obsessed with Saturday Night Fever. The cinematography by Stéphane Fontaine, who also shot this month's Elle, is outstanding, and the pacing and structure are fine. But there’s something about Jackie that left me cold. Maybe it's the score by Mica Levi, which has drawn rave reviews, although I found it intrusive. Portman delivers a stunning portrait of grief, as well the early days of what we now call spin-doctoring and political image-making. On top of the emotions, Portman also nails Jackie's accent. Portman doesn't act as much as she used to, but she tends to absolutely bring it when she does. There isn't really any other performance of significant note here. Lynch's performance as Lyndon Johnson, while a physical match, won't make anyone forget Tom Wilkinson or Bryan Cranston's recent LBJ portrayals. Sarsgaard, as Robert Kennedy, doesn’t even attempt an accent. However, I did enjoy minor Sopranos actor Max Casella as belligerent LBJ aide Jack Valenti; I guess it’s safe for Hollywood to depict the longtime MPAA head as a jerk now that he’s been dead for almost 10 years. Yes, Jackie is better than Parkland, the strange and pointless dramatization of JFK’s death that served as failed Oscar bait two years ago. A Woman Named Jackie, the TV miniseries from the early 1990s starring Roma Downey as Jackie—and Sarah Michelle Gellar as her younger self!—was somewhat underrated, but this is preferable to that as well. And while watching it, I thought of Paul Krassner's ""The Parts That Were Left Out of the Kennedy Book"" too. Then there are other, very different films about the way people process grief. The Eyes of My Mother, directed by 26-year-old New York native Nicolas Pesce, is a shocking horror film that offers a compelling black-and-white style and a couple of worthwhile points to make about desensitization to extreme violence. But it goes on making that point in a way that's disgusting and exploitative. The film concerns a girl named Francisca, who lives in a remote farmhouse with a mother who teaches her skills like removing the eyes of cows. One day, the home gets a mysterious visitor, leading to a variety of disturbing things, from torture to kidnapping to eye removal of the non-cow variety. It's also another one of those movies that tries to give itself unearned gravitas by repeatedly referencing Catholicism. The nicest thing I can say about The Eyes of My Mother is that it's only 77 minutes long. Anything longer would have been even more punishing."
"Dec 23, 2016",POSITIVE," In an isolated farmhouse in the middle of the countryside, Francisca (Olivia Bond) is being instructed in the ways of life and death by her Mother (Diana Agostini), a former Portuguese surgeon who left that life behind to marry the young girl’s father (Paul Nazak). After a horrifying home invasion tragedy destroys all they hold dear, father and daughter move on with their lives as best they can, continuing to go through their various daily rituals all the while harboring an unimaginable secret deep within the underbelly of their barn. Years later, an adult Francisca (Kika Magalhaes) continues as she always has, but when her father passes and her barn is suddenly empty, a hole opens in the young woman’s life unlike any she’s ever known before. Soon she is looking for something to fill that space. Francisca wants something, someone, to care for and to nurture, a person she can take under her wing much like her mother did for her, showing them the ways of the world though eyes that are as indescribably unique as they are eerily terrifying. It’s safe to say there is little else out there like The Eyes of My Mother. As instantly mesmerizing a debut as any I’ve had the good fortune to come across this year, writer/director Nicolas Pesce bursting onto the scene with idiosyncratic relish and ferociously uncompromising tenacity. As if channeling the ghosts of Tod Browning and Mario Bava and combining them with the assaultive brio of Dario Argento, Takashi Shimizu and George A. Romero in their respective primes, he’s made a haunting sojourn into the heart of darkness that’s absolutely petrifying. This is an esoteric, brutally obdurate marvel, one filled with as many delights as it is horrors, everything building to a climax of absurdly disquieting abhorrence that had me shuddering long after the screen faded to black. Making sense of it all is an admitted chore. Pesce is esoteric to fault, keeping things so nondescript and ephemeral that finding the point of all this casually gorgeous violence is decidedly difficult. There is no character building per se, just the vaguest ideas about who Francisca is and how the traumas from her past, the crazed influence of her father and the extreme isolation of the farmhouse have all conspired to make her what she now is. She’s an idea more than she is anything else, cinematographer Zach Kuperstein’s steely black and white cinematography signifying more about who and what this woman is, as well as who she is likely to become, than just about anything else in the motion picture does. Yet, this is a movie more about how it makes the viewer feel than it is almost anything else, and on that level Pesce succeeds like gangbusters. Following Francisca around is observational perversity, her categorically undying need to make a personal connection with whomever she can whenever she can creating an aura of ubiquitous anxiety that seeps under the skin with the subtle grace of a mosquito sucking blood in the middle of the night. Seeing her troll area bars searching for someone, not exactly knowing who that will be or why she needs to, only to be beyond aghast when they’re scared to death once they realize what’s happening inside the walls of the barn adjacent to her home, it’s profoundly disturbing, and that’s only the beginning of the psychological devastation that will slowly unfurl as things progress towards the film’s final act. I can’t talk about that last third for reasons that will become apparent to anyone watching the movie. Safe to say, it’s glorious, but it’s also disgusting. What Francisca does, how she decides to fill that hole in her life, it’s unquestionably unpardonable, making her a demonic creature who hides behind a wholesomely timid smile of friendship. Yet she is a demon who has no idea just how terrible she is, believing in her heart of hearts she’s doing good even if the truth is anything but. It’s a slow, delicate walk straight into the heart of darkness; the mirror image staring back so chilling it stops the blood cold. The Eyes of My Mother is a riveting, repugnant work of repellent art, Pesce crafting a gracefully unnerving calling card sure to be debated and discussed for some time to come.

"Dec 20, 2016",POSITIVE,"A film with beautiful aesthetics, although it tells a terrible story with a disconcerting naturalness. [Full review in Spanish]"

"Dec 16, 2016",POSITIVE," A little horror is good for the holidays. Or so must be the thinking of counterprogramming Nicolas Pesce's pitch-dark study of pain and torture in these mid-December days. An extraordinarily bleak look at one rural woman's obsession with suffering over the course of her awful lifetime, The Eyes of My Mother is not for the easily queasy. It is a stark, dreadful vision – but one that is fascinatingly executed, with a compelling central performance from Kika Magalhaes as a matter-of-fact monster. First-time filmmaker Pesce is undoubtedly ""working through some things"" here, but whenever the film threatens to stumble into an art-school parody of torture porn, the director twists off in a new direction, albeit a horrifying one."
"Dec 15, 2016",POSITIVE," Like a Buñuelian fever dream, the eye and the razor are the focus of Kirsten Johnson’s awe-inspiring documentary, which is at once personal, universal and questioning. Cameraperson is drawn mainly from provocatively cut scenes that Johnson, an award-winning New York cinematographer, has captured in 25 years of working for other filmmakers on such lauded docs as Citizenfour, Fahrenheit 9/11, Darfur Now, The Invisible War and Trapped. The subjects are as varied as her travels — privacy concerns, global terrorism, African genocide, sexual assault and abortion rights in these five films alone — and her presentation may at first seem as random as the lightning strike her alert lens captures on a Missouri road. What emerges, in concert with Nels Bangerter’s skilled editing, are startling juxtapositions that combine for deeper meaning. Images recalling the violence of 9/11, the Wounded Knee massacre and the mass murder of Tutsis in Rwanda collide with scenes of an angry Golden Gloves boxer in Brooklyn, a Nigerian midwife trying to revive a barely breathing newborn, Johnson’s twin toddlers frolicking in the family’s home and her own mother, as she struggles with Alzheimer’s disease. Johnson’s bravery is apparent; so is her compassion. She doesn’t show the face of a pregnant Alabama teenager discussing abortion with health clinic counsellors, only the girl’s fidgeting hands. She extends similar dignity to a Bosnian woman describing repeated rape at the hands of military attackers and to the memory of James Byrd Jr., the African-American man in Texas who white supremacists dragged to his death in 1998. She questions the journalistic tradition of dispassionate observer. She is audibly concerned as her camera suddenly spots two young Bosnian boys playing with a sharp axe. And Johnson admits to tearing up as she shows a young Afghan boy describing how he lost an eye in the same bomb blast that killed his brother. This is a flimsy greeting card of a movie, one that tries to check off all the sympathy boxes for grief but succeeds only in cheapening emotion. Will Smith is Howard, top dog of a New York ad firm fuelled by insipid slogans (“What is your WHY?”), who plunges into a hermitic and self-destructive depression after his 6-year-old daughter dies of cancer. He spends his days penning angry letters to Love, Time and Death, the abstract concepts he blames for his misery. His business partners (played by Edward Norton, Kate Winslet and Michael Peña) are terrified he’ll run the company into the ground. They hire actors (played by Keira Knightley, Jacob Latimore and Helen Mirren) to impersonate Love, Time and Death and to stalk Howard, either to snap him out of his funk or to build a case he’s mentally incapable of business affairs. It’s an appalling waste of talent, as well as our time, but director David Frankel (The Devil Wears Prada) and writer Allan Loeb (The Switch) may see the “collateral beauty” of having made the year’s worst studio movie. One of Chile’s pre-eminent filmmakers, Pablo Larrain returns to the country’s troubled past with an imagined tale, a “fabulous chase” between poet Pablo Neruda, an avowed communist and enemy of the state, and a police inspector who’s determined to catch him. The literate script by Guillermo Calderon is full of wry and cynical observations from narrator Inspector Peluchonneau — to wit: “Communists hate to work, they’d rather burn churches” — as he pursues a wily quarry abetted by his multitude of working class supporters. Luis Gnecco, who bears a strong resemblance to the Nobel Prize-winning poet, is brilliant in the title role as a man of soaring intellect and hedonist appetites who grapples with his reluctant role as defender of the poor. Then it segues into the first of three parts, when a strange man arrives at the remote farm where Francisca lives with her parents. He kills her mother but her father arrives and exacts revenge, chaining him up in the barn. Francisca, who is desperately lonely, is inspired when the man tells her that killing feels “amazing.” The skills her ex-surgeon mother teaches her soon come into play. Beautifully shot in black and white, Pesce uses stillness and silence to increase the sense of unease. Kika Magelhaes’s performance as Francisca is impeccable. Chilling and disturbing, this is not a film for the faint-hearted. Harry Benson is a disarming Scottish shutterbug with a Hugh Grant-ish head of hair, a green pocket square and the ability to get the kind of access that leads to photos like John Lennon’s jailed killer Mark David Chapman jumping up in the air. Benson was a Daily Express photojournalist in the 1960s when he was sent to Paris to photograph the Beatles (he didn’t want to go). His shot of the Fab Four having a pillow fight launched a star-studded career that includes images of the Clintons canoodling in a hammock, Donald Trump cradling $1 million in cash, and Dolly Parton putting on her makeup. Filmmakers Matthew Miele and Justin Bare (Scatter My Ashes at Bergdorf’s) document Benson’s fascinating life with an impressive list of celebrity and media talking heads, and a mostly uncritical eye. But no doubt they were just as charmed by their 87-year-old subject as viewers will be; the only thing better than Harry Benson behind the camera is Harry Benson in front of it.

"Dec 14, 2016",POSITIVE," There are plenty of horror movies set in old farmhouses. They’re an ideal location, really: isolated, overlooked, usually with a cavernous barn nearby capable of muffling even the loudest scream. Picture The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, or even Motel Hell – those films are set in places where bad people fall upon unsuspecting visitors over and over again, undisturbed and unstopped. Nicolas Pesce’s feature debut – produced by filmmakers Antonio Campos (Christine), Sean Durkin (Martha Marcy May Marlene) and Josh Mond (James White) – takes a rural horror story and executes it in an intellectualized, austere fashion. You can appreciate exactly how well-made it is even as the dread piles on top of you like a blanket. As a little girl, Francisca (Olivia Bond) is witness to a series of horrible, bloody events a decade or so later, she’s grown up to be a deeply disturbed young woman (Kika Magalhaes) who processes her inexpressible desires by inflicting bloody horrors on others. The story may not be particularly original, but the execution is immersive and even seductive, like the best nightmares. Pesce shoots it all in black and white, using long takes and deliberate camera movements to create disquieting tableaux that seem to close in on us as we watch."
"Dec 9, 2016",NEUTRAL," First-time writer-director Nicolas Pesce’s The Eyes of My Mother feels unnervingly like a Diane Arbus photo that’s been stretched into a film. Which is to say, it’s unnerving, a shadowy black-and-white (well, black-and-gray) image of an older, less homogenized, more frequently grotesque world, where even beauty and innocence may serve to heighten a sense of overwhelming dread and/or impending doom. Viz: Why is that pretty little girl so calm about picking shards of glass from the mangled face of the wounded man chained up in her barn — the same man who murdered her mother just hours before? And don’t tell me it’s because Mom, a former surgeon before she became a former person, taught her daughter all about bodies and dissection. No, the real reason is the lack of Facebook — or at least, the sense of community and connection that Facebook purports to provide, even to people living in rural isolation. People who must otherwise rely on their families, their silent fathers and (Blessed) mothers. It’s absolutely no accident that the Virgin Mary appears in the background of so many scenes. It may, in fact, be the point. Soon after the movie opens, we meet mother and daughter out in the garden by a statue of Saint Francis, Mommy relating the story of how the saint lived in the wilderness, beheld a religious vision, and then acquired the stigmata — the wounds of Christ manifested in his own body. But, notes Mom, Francis eventually died of an eye disease that also causes psychosis. Her conclusion: “Loneliness can do strange things to the mind.” The daughter, tellingly named Francisca, promptly runs her finger along the crown of thorns atop the statue and gains a wound of her own. That’s the story, right there. What remains of the 76-minute runtime is just a gradual (but gripping) manifestation. It isn’t long before Mama is dead and her killer is safely stowed in the barn. And it isn’t long after that before Papa is dead and Francisca is on her own — she may claim that she can feel her mother near, but her fervent prayers to Mom for guidance and comfort are met with terrifying, even maddening silence. Lacking both parental guidance and community mores, the young woman starts flailing about for connection, with increasingly awful results. With no one — not even the divine — around to tell her what may not be done, Francisca’s need becomes her sole motivation and pole star. Add to that her powerful memory of Mom’s surgical prowess, and...well, it isn’t pretty.

"Dec 6, 2016",POSITIVE," One of the most basic facts of horror writing is that real terror requires isolation. It’s nearly impossible to keep characters in scary situations if there’s easy help right around the corner, or plenty of sympathetic people to consult about the problem. Horror stories find different ways to isolate the victims, by setting stories in desolate, out-of-the-way places (like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre or Psycho), or by putting characters in situations where other people won’t believe them, or just can’t help. (The Babadook and It Follows are terrific recent examples.) Nicolas Pesce’s gory writing and directing debut Eyes of My Mother goes all-in on the idea of a remote location where horrible things can happen, and no one will ever know. But Pesce does a lot more with the idea of isolation — emotional, physical, and even moral. His monstrous protagonist murders and mutilates because she’s fighting off loneliness, which makes her a tragic, sympathetic figure, at least between atrocities. But she’s also lived so much of her life in isolation that she has no idea her actions are abnormal. Raised on tragedy and aberrant behavior, she imitates and extrapolates from it. She’s casual, even innocent, in the way she carves up her victims and packages them in her refrigerator. Even in the film’s creepiest shock moments, she’s placid and pleasant, which just makes her more disturbing. As the film opens, Francisca is a child living with her parents on a rural farm. Her mother (Diana Agostini) is a former surgeon who demonstrates dissection for her little girl as casual entertainment; her father (Paul Nazak) is a quiet, unexpressive man who treats his wife and daughter as none of his business. Then a grinning stranger named Charlie (Will Brill) arrives and demands access to the house. Pesce only hints at what follows, but it leaves Francisca without a mother, and Charlie mutilated and chained in the barn. “You’re going to kill me, aren’t you?” he asks Francisca humbly. “Why would I?” she says. “You’re my only friend.” Much of the horror that follows from that exchange is implied rather than spelled out, which is a large part of what makes Pesce’s debut memorable. He includes plenty of suggestive sound effects, bloody hands, and lingering shots of damaged bodies. But again and again, he steers clear of showing the moment of impact on-screen, and he leaves the worst to the audience’s imagination. That gimmick was partially designed to make the most of the film’s obvious low budget. (Eyes was largely shot in one location, in black and white, with a small cast, over 18 days.) But it also gives Eyes a compellingly nerve-racking sense that no matter how bad things get on-screen — and given the film’s obsession with eye mutilation and necrophilia, it gets pretty bad — there are even worse things happening offscreen, especially during the long time elapses between some key scenes. Those time elapses are major problems for the story, which doesn’t entirely hold together, and leaves out so much information, especially in the abrupt ending, that it becomes distracting. The film often seems more like a series of vignettes than a narrative, and its dependence on shock value gets tiring. But Pesce balances out the story’s baldness with a slyly suggestive combination of extreme violence and subtler psychological manipulation. Like so many other recent memorable horror debuts — The Witch and The Babadook in particular — Eyes of My Mother prioritizes shivery moods and beautifully composed images above strict narrative logic, and like both those films, it builds extreme terror out of horror’s most valuable asset: the fear of the unknown, particularly the question of what could possibly happen next under such bizarre circumstances. And also like those two debuts, Eyes of My Mother turns on a few key performances. Kika Magalhaes makes the movie as the adult Francisca. Her placid, beautiful face and her deliberately unnatural body language suggest a woman living a complicated internal life, without any external sense of herself. She’s as removed from the world as the children in Yorgos Lanthimos’ Dogtooth, and as prone to startling behavior, with no sense of conscience or remorse. And she brings across her separation from society in subtle ways. When Francisca invites someone into her home, she stands with her arms stiffly at her sides, turned outward so her wrists face forward; it’s such a strikingly weird stance, compared to her guest’s more normal body language, that it defines Francisca’s isolation from normal society more than it would if she gibbered and raved. When Francisca listens to music and dances on her own, she moves as though she’d never seen anyone dance before, and had to create the idea of dance from scratch. Her mixture of physical awkwardness and confidence, her haunting inhumanity and the film’s stillness around her, all strongly recall Ana Lily Amirpour’s 2014 debut A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night.  So does the film’s eerie, echoing score, and its stylish black-and-white cinematography. Pesce and cinematographer Zach Kuperstein underline the film’s uncanniness by putting cameras in odd places: mounted on a body, on a tarp as a body is being dragged away, on a drone overlooking a house or a highway. And they shoot in such high contrast that their compositions suggest Ingmar Berman making arty splatter films. Eyes of My Mother is a problematic film that lurches from one ugly image to the next without making enough sense of the connections. And Pesce doesn’t vary the mood enough to create a sense of rising action, or to give the audience any catharsis through the violence. But he also creates some extreme beauty out of ugliness, and he builds amazing tension out of quiet moments and simple movement. This is a film about a young girl exposed to unimaginable tragedy, and dealing with it in unimaginable ways. She’s isolated from the moment Pesce introduces her to the audience, and his promising debut is more than capable of isolating everyone in the audience, by dragging them, willing or not, into her unsettling world."
"Dec 4, 2016",POSITIVE,"Designed to trigger a strong emotional response, and nobody can rightfully deny that it does so."
"Dec 2, 2016",POSITIVE," PLOT: A young girl creates an unusual freindship after her mother is viciously murdered. As she grows older, she finds that the attack has brought her down a dark and demented journey of heartbreak and horror. REVIEW: Most horror fans love a good and gory scary movie. It’s always fun to see just how creative the filmmakers can get when slashing victims left and right. However, it is even more satisfying when a director can create a fright flick that can get under your skin with nary a dismemberment in sight – although this feature is not without a little bit of that. While THE EYES OF MY MOTHER may offer a few slightly brutal images, this is not about the blood and guts, this is far more emothionally horrific than that. Shot in monochrome, this dark story of a lonely woman who hides a scary secret is at times brilliant – occasionally a bit convoluted – and more than a little disturbed. Once again, we have a fascinating slow burn of a thriller continuing to make 2016 one of the best years of genre that we’ve seen. As a little girl, Francisca (Olivia Bond plays her as a child) was always obsessed with what goes on inside the human body. Much of that had been passed down from her mother who was an eye doctor. When a stranger named Charlie (Will Brill) shows up at their doorstep, something horrible happens to the young girl’s mother. This vicious assault changes Francisca in the darkest of ways. As an adult, Francisca (Kika Magalhaes) is desperate to not be alone. She struggles with her aging father and hidden fantasies that have become a part of her, something that leads her on a path of murderous consequences. At the heart of THE EYES OF MY MOTHER is the film’s leading lady. Kika Magalhaes is exceptional as Francisca. As the movie progresses, you become frightfully aware of what she is capable of. The actress brings a quiet and sometimes sensitive portrayal of a woman desperate for the company of others. Even if her idea of companionship is more than a little troubled. It’s a bit tricky as it is very difficult to sympathize considering her actions – even as a child she clearly has psychotic tendencies. Thankfully the actress brings a haunting depth to the role. She is able to maneuver through her mother’s tragic death to her own sinister needs and desires. It’s a powerful performance. This stylish film is written and directed by Nicolas Pesce. In a fine directorial debut, the first time filmmaker explores decidedly complex material. He slowly maneuvers through Francisca’s life as a child up until her as an adult. The black and white imagery is possibly more effective than it would have been in color. You could easily make comparisons to PSYCHO as the film takes place in her family home and a garage on the premises. It also places the main focus on a tortured individual. It is a small and claustrophobic fear that builds as Francisca’s loneliness grows to deadly proportions. For a first film, it is a damn impressive debut. Any qualms? Well, yes. As much as I respect THE EYES OF MY MOTHER, it is not a pleasant watch in any way shape or form. This is the type of film you can take in once but I can’t imagine many repeated viewings. It is a grim story that may not be for everybody. It’s not that all horror movies have to be fun popcorn flicks, but in some ways this is more in line with something like IRREVERSIBLE, but without the extreme graphic images. In fact, that’s the thing that is most shocking; just how little it shows but still manages to leave a bit of an emotional scar on the viewer. In fact, sometimes watching this, especially the third act, is a near painful experience due to the nature of what she is. And frankly, the story is more than a little implausible – which is only noticeable because the film is decidedly grounded in reality. THE EYES OF MY MOTHER is a film that I respect more than enjoy. As effective as it may be, at times the story itself is a tad convoluted to a fault. And even more than that, you won’t likely want to watch more than once. Still, Kika Magalhaes is stunning and since so much of the film relies on her performance, it is all the better for it. With only one film on his resume, we may have something truly special with Nicolas Pesce. Without the benefit or overabundance of gore, the filmmaker has crafted one of the most disturbingly frightening horror films of the year – even if it can be quite unpleasant. It looks like both Abigail and Guy Ritchie’s The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare aren’t likely to make much of an impact at the box office. We have compiled a list of everything we know about 28 Years Later, a trilogy of sequels to Danny Boyle and Alex Garland’s 28 Days Later."
"Dec 2, 2016",NEGATIVE," There’s plenty of creepy imagery and unsettling twists in this black-and-white exercise in Gothic horror from rookie director Nicolas Pesce, even if it doesn’t add up to much. It centers on a troubled young woman (Kika Magalhaes) still reeling from her mother’s murder after an attack inside their rural farmhouse. She methodically embarks on a pattern of sadistic violence in retaliation that turns the house into a torture chamber. While the deliberately paced film subverts genre expectations with some stylish visual flourishes, any deeper meaning behind the nonchalant gore and the psychological effects on its protagonist remain muddled. There’s minimal suspense or rooting interest. (Rated R, 76 minutes). It’s supposed to be a compassionate examination of the devastating effects of military post-traumatic stress disorder, but this heavy-handed drama from director Dito Montiel (Fighting) is more exploitative than insightful. It chronicles the psychological trauma of a Marine (Shia LaBeouf) after an incident in Afghanistan involving his best friend (Jai Courtney) that also has ramifications for his wife (Kate Mara) and young son back home. The film’s jumbled narrative structure — much of the story is told in flashbacks and in a hazy post-apocalyptic future — drains much of the suspense, while the manipulative twists lack subtlety and surprise. The ill-conceived result lacks coherence and emotional resonance. (Rated R, 92 minutes). The frustrations of unrequited love lead to disturbing consequences in this silly low-budget thriller about an employee (Dominic Monaghan) at an animal shelter whose obsession with an alluring waitress (Ksenia Solo) leads to him kidnapping the woman and imprisoning her in a dog cage alongside his canine companions. That’s when she begins a psychological game to win her freedom. The resulting power struggle between hostage and captor manages some tense moments, and both lead performances bring more depth to the material than the script warrants. Yet the film doesn’t get under the skin as intended, in part because of the obvious way the scheme unravels. (Rated R, 94 minutes). This drama of redemption and reconciliation within a fractured family takes a familiar path as it hits the road with Rey (Taylor Lautner), a New Mexico grocery clerk feeling plenty of animosity toward his single mother (Constance Zimmer), who’s been locked up on drug charges. When she’s due for release, Rey still resents having to put his dreams on hold to raise his half-brother (Nico Christou), so he basically kidnaps the youngster and heads for the coast to avoid a reunion out of spite. While the underlying lessons learned about family might be heartfelt, the film’s earnest predictability cancels out most of the credibility. (Rated PG-13, 96 minutes). Isabelle Huppert (Elle) shines as a woman enduring a midlife crisis in this perceptive character study from director Mia Hansen-Love (Eden). Huppert plays a Parisian philosophy teacher forced to navigate a crumbling marriage, an overbearing mother (Edith Scob) and her cat, and a sudden loss of job security. As she reaches a low point, a former student and political activist (Roman Kolinka) reaches out to help in unexpected ways. Although the film deals with familiar themes of infidelity and shifting family dynamics, Hansen-Love’s approach feels fresh with her tender and bittersweet examination of moving forward and valuing memories, without settling for cheap sentimental payoffs. (Rated PG-13, 102 minutes)."
"Dec 2, 2016",POSITIVE," Some people commit unspeakable acts in the heat of passion. Others do it because it makes them feel good. Then there are those who simply learn violence at a young age, and don't know anything else. Those are the topics broached by director Nicolas Pesce in his intimate, avant-garde horror flick, The Eyes of My Mother, and the result is one of the most expertly crafted and persistently shocking films ever to grace the silver screen. The film opens on a long, tense, black and white shot that won't make sense at first. It's not supposed to. All it does it set the spine-chilling tone of the affair. From there, we find ourselves introduced to the seemingly idyllic life of a young Francisca and her mother as they study and practice anatomy in their rural home. Francisca's mother was once an eye surgeon in her native home of Portugal, and hopes to one day pass on that trade to her young daughter. However, without getting to in the weeds with regards to spoilers, they soon find their quaint lives shattered by a single act of unspeakable violence, and what follows is a tale of a young, friendless girl who develops a skewed (to say the least) view of what humans beings can and should do to each other. It's a simple premise, and one used by director Nicolas Pesce to frightening effect. Honestly, I cannot even begin to properly articulate how much this movie chilled me on a primal level. Subject matter aside, The Eyes of My Mother is a master class in horror filmmaking through its expert use of black and white cinematography, as well as its lovely musical accompaniment -- both of which harken back to a bygone era of silent horror filmmaking. Seriously, The Eyes of My Mother feels like Un Chien Andalou viewed through the eyes of a sociopath. Once the credits started to roll, I assumed my phone was about to ring and I would be greeted with a voice saying I would die within seven days. The film simply strikes that balance between reality and otherworldliness. Much of that balance is owed to Kika Magalhaes' unsettling (to say the least) performance as Francisca. Seldom have we ever seen a horror movie character who manages to convey complete derangement while simultaneously garnering our sympathy. Even when she's obviously tumbling down a very dark rabbit hole, there's something about her -- through a combination of Magalhaes' own physical beauty, as well as her stunning performance -- that almost makes you want to try and help her climb out. That's character symmetry rarely achieved in the modern horror genre. In fact, there's something about Francisca that's oddly reminiscent of Eihi Shiina's Asami from the 1999 Japanese horror movie Audition. They're both real people that you could easily run into in your every day life, but they also happen to harbor evil that makes A Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger look like a boy scout. That being said, the beauty of The Eyes of My Mother's cruelty truly lies in its surprising level of restraint. Yes, the film definitely shows unspeakable acts of violence and buckets of blood are spilled, but upon a second viewing of the film I found myself surprised by how much of the worst of this film is left to the imagination. What really makes The Eyes of My Mother ruthless is the way is the way in which it contextualizes the violence -- the way a character responds to a subtle (yet cringe inducing) stab, a wide shot to show their seclusions, or even a simple cut to show a terrifying passage of time. Nicolas Pesce doesn't just record violence, he uses the medium of film to create art out of it. One could make an easy case that The Eyes of My Mother falls into the ""torture porn"" category in the sense that it definitely takes an exploitative approach to violence and human suffering. However, it's the overall execution that elevates this particular outing above the films that give horror a bad name. The Eyes of My Mother burrows into your psyche and takes you to a dark place you didn't know existed. It feels like everyone involved in the making of this film had an understanding regarding how far they wanted to take the material, and it shows just about every aspect of the film -- from the lead performance, to what you can see and hear on screen. Of course, despite the praise I'm heaping upon The Eyes of My Mother, I have to note that it's not a perfect film. At a brisk 76 minutes in length, the film very clearly feels a bit too short -- and this issue is further bolstered by the fact that it's divided into three separate thematic story segments. The result of these qualities is a movie that has a tendency to go from A to B to C a little bit too quickly, without taking enough time to breathe. Once the horror starts, it doesn't really let up. That being said, I am not entirely sure that (in my fragile emotional state) I would've been able to watch more of this film by the time the credits started to roll. The last few years have seen a surge in high quality horror films, and the renaissance has been an absolute treat for fans of terror. However, The Eyes of My Mother genuinely takes the genre and places it firmly within the realm of high culture, resulting in one of the most haunting films ever made. Originally from Connecticut, Conner grew up in San Diego and graduated from Chapman University in 2014. He now lives in Los Angeles working in and around the entertainment industry and can mostly be found binging horror movies and chugging coffee."
"Dec 2, 2016",POSITIVE," Picture Grant Wood’s  famous painting American Gothic, the one with the stolid farmer and his missus. Now imagine that, were you able to slowly pan down and magically see what was going on just below the frame of this landmark 20th-century artwork, you were to spy a lithe girl sitting at their feet. She’s slowly sawing away at the older couple’s legs, cutting through sinew and bone, blood pooling around her on the ground. (You don’t hear the elderly gent and his anxious-looking spouse screaming, as the young woman has already removed their tongues.) She has to do this, you understand, because if she hacks off their limbs, they can’t run away from her. Now, she thinks, I’ll never, ever have to be alone again. That’s the closest approximation to the feeling you get from watching The Eyes of My Mother, Nicolas Pesce’s stunning, sick-as-fuck debut that quickly establishes itself as a high point of modern art-horror nightmare fodder. Its set-up could not be more Rural True Crime 101: A child named Francisca (Olivia Bond) lives in the countryside with her Portuguese mother and stoic Midwestern father. A stranger named Charlie (Will Brill) shows up one day while Dad is out, asking to use the bathroom; both Mom and viewers know something about this guy, who resembles a creepy, giggling Mormon missionary, is way off. But the scenario plays itself out with a horrifying inevitability, and when Pops comes home to find his daughter sitting quietly in the kitchen and the visitor doing unspeakable things in their bathroom, the tables get turned. Soon, Charlie finds himself chained up in the family barn. “You’re going to kill me, aren’t you?” he asks Francisca, as she sews up a wound. “Why would I kill you,” the child replies. “You’re my only friend.” What follows is a portrait of a burgeoning serial killer, rendered in the sort of stark black-and-white visual palette associated with police-file crime pics (though Zach Kuperstein’s monochromatic cinematography couldn’t be more beautiful, more expressionistic or more dread-inducing) and blessed with a groaning-to-droning score by Ariel Loh that suggests complete psychic breakdown. As the now-grown Francisca (Kika Magalhaes) exemplifies her mom’s statement about the way “loneliness can do strange things to the mind,” the film keeps toggling between making you sympathize with this poor, warped person and toying with your nervous system as the people who hover into her orbit find themselves reduced to permanent playthings or mysterious wrapped packages in a freezer. By the time you’ve dropped your jaw over some gorgeously grotesque images – a corpse being tenderly washed in a milky bath, a long shot of a figure wandering blindly through a field, a silhouette of a witching-hour burial – and nearly lost your lunch over its pitiless brutality, you won’t feel that you’ve watched this thrilling addition to backwoods guignol so much as been infected by it. Which is how good horror should operate; given that the movie comes blessed by Borderline Films, an indie outfit responsible for films like Afterschool (2008) and Martha Marcy May Marlene (2011), you might think that this skew towards the imprint’s in-house nihilistic chic. But if anything, Pesce’s yowl into the abyss resembles the early Seventies’ spate of scary movies (see Hooper, Tobe) set in our nation’s rustic outskirts and whose monsters looked like your neighbors when they weren’t wearing skin-masks. If The Eyes of My Mother is occasionally stylistic to a fault and ends way too abruptly, it’s also the mark of someone who isn’t afraid to make something that leaves scars. This is what curdled Americana looks like – a Joel-Peter Witkin portfolio come to life and a vision of jus’ folks weaned on isolation, madness, and good old Type O."
"Dec 2, 2016",NEUTRAL," The Eyes of My Mother starts behind the wheel of a truck. A murder ballad plays on the radio as the driver grinds the gears to a halt and gets out to investigate why a woman walked into the road, sensed the truck’s approach, and then didn’t run away but lay down in the giant truck’s path. It’s an eerie way to start a movie, but it turns out to be the least unsettling part of Nicolas Pesce’s first feature film, a nightmare that’s shot like an art film. The Eyes of My Mother is skin-crawling gothic horror about mutilated minds and bodies, which makes its frame-by-frame monochromatic beauty all the more unnerving.  The Eyes of My Mother feels like a folk tale. Told in three chapters titled “Mother,” “Father,” and “Family,” it’s a growing-up story gone horribly wrong, with some pronounced psychological overtones. Young Francisca (Olivia Bond) learns from her mother (Diana Agostini), who was once a surgeon in Portugal, about anatomy, dissection, and the similarity between the eyes of cows and of humans. This all seems a bit macabre, but for the most part, they live a quiet life on a farm in the Midwest, and things seem peaceful. That peace is shattered when a stranger named Charlie (Will Brill) shows up and casually forces his way into the house; Francisca’s father (Paul Nazak) returns home to find his wife being viciously murdered. Taking his revenge, her father elects to bury his wife and chain Charlie in the barn after beating him. Francisca goes a step further, both stitching Charlie back together and mutilating him further. (This is really not a movie for anyone with a weak stomach.) Time passes. A now-grown Francisca (Kika Magalhaes) is still tending to the invader, but she’s also clearly deeply lonely. When her father dies, she goes to the local bar and picks up a young woman (Clara Wong), who grows uncomfortable during their conversation and leaves. In response, Francisca heads for the barn and brings Charlie — who must have been out there for a decade or more by now — back in. The events continue to spool out with increasing senselessness. Casual torture is, it seems, the only way Francisca can construct some messed-up semblance of a “normal” life, perhaps because she seems stunted by isolation. (There are some low-grade resonances with Yorgos Lanthimos’s Dogtooth here.) The Eyes of My Mother indulges in profound time gaps, the better to let our imaginations fill in the blanks with the worst. The result doesn’t seem to add up to anything in particular, which may be its strength: It’s not exactly social commentary, not entirely a probing of the human psyche. It’s impenetrable — frightening and stomach-turning, but without an obvious corollary in human experience.  Is The Eyes of My Mother about mental illness, psychological trauma, twisted family relationships, or all of the above? The movie drops hints in all directions, purposely hitting all those notes and more. As with most stories involving apparently random cruelty — whether it’s Francisca or The Dark Knight’s Joker — the aggressor is that much scarier for not having an origin story, a single cause on which to pin their behavior. Young Francisca seems unnaturally obsessed with death; her mother tells a cryptic story about a disorder that affects the eyes but also the psyche; the trauma of the invasion explains a little, but not much. And because it’s shot in serene, carefully graded monochrome, the story seems like it could be set anywhere and any time, existing equally in the past, present, and future. The juxtaposition of violence and serenity is far more disturbing than an unrelenting assault of violence would be. Just when it’s settled down, it starts again. This narrative, inexplicable and fraying at the edges, is what’s so horrifying — which, for aesthetically tuned-in fans of horror, is exactly the point. The Eyes of My Mother is effective and unsettling, and as a first movie from Pesce, it promises much more in the future. It’s not going to explain itself to you. It won’t ask for permission to exist. It’s just going to leave you chained in the dark, blinded and wondering.

"Dec 2, 2016",POSITIVE," When she was a little girl, Francisca's (Olivia Bond) Portuguese mother (Diana Agostini), a former surgeon now farmer, tells her that a cow's eyes are just like a human's, encouraging the girl to learn anatomy as they dissect one in their kitchen. It is an odd yet peaceful existence until a stranger, Charlie (Will Brill, ""Not Fade Away""), invades their isolated home. Francisca's older dad (Paul Nazak) returns to a horrific scene, handling it without notifying authorities, but the events will warp the mind of his lonely daughter in ""The Eyes of My Mother."""
"Dec 2, 2016",POSITIVE," Half a century after Polanski's landmark Repulsion, the past two years have proven to be an interesting period for arthouse portrayals of young woman descending into violent madness. The screeching monochrome of Mickey Keating's Darling has met the giallo hysteria of Luciano Onetti's Francesca and the understated but equally bleak disintegration of Harrison Atkins' Lace Crater. Portuguese-American fable The Eyes Of My Mother blends elements of all three. Its lush black and white visuals unfold around the story of a girl obsessed by death who finds herself walking a lonely course as external events shape her destiny. The girl - played by Olivia Bond and later Kika Magalhaes in an almost seamless transition - is Francisca, growing up out in the countryside, able to engage with the world if she wants to but just as easily overlooked. Her mother is a farmer, formerly a doctor; we first meet them when she is teaching the child anatomy by dissecting the head of a cow. The only real difference between a cow's eye and a human eye, she explains, is that the cow's is bigger. Young Francisca understands the world in practical terms. When events steal her mother and her father slowly recedes, she has no guide through whom to discover the etiquette and moral niceties of human interaction. The Eyes Of My Mother is melancholy and poetic, a picture of loneliness, its suffocated passions escaping only in the thundering vocals that accompany the closing credits. We meet Francisca three times, at pivotal moments in her life - the shattering of her childhood innocence, the discovery of her sexuality, the awakening of the desire to become a mother - yet her journey is a consistent one, each chapter unfolding with a sense of inevitability. The casual cruelty of the stranger who enters her household that first day, Will Brill's Charlie flush with youthful certainty that this is a man's world where women cannot take power, becomes as much an influence as her mother's studied kindness and her father's agonised disinterest. Lacking the standard social toolkit, she tries to make her way using the skills she has acquired working with animals. Pesce's lingering static takes and decision to shoot in black and white have the effect of distancing the audience somewhat from the brutality in his tale, as Francisca is distanced, but there is no escaping the psychological horror of the events it depicts. The social transgression stemming from Francisca's assumption of traditionally male behaviours will also disturb some viewers, perhaps more than they might expect. Magalhaes is superb throughout and perfectly in sync with the childlike perspective on events that Pesce brings us. Her fluid movement (she's a former dancer) enhances the sense that she is living in an animal way - and that this is what humanity becomes when shorn of its civilised trappings. Her soulful eyes are those of a wild thing we might pity or even admire, but from which we would keep our distance."
"Dec 2, 2016",POSITIVE," The virtues of writer-director Nicolas Pesce’s debut feature are readily apparent. The Eyes of My Mother looks fantastic, shot in a shadowy black-and-white that evokes the nightmare-inducing TV shows of the late ’50s and early ’60s (Alfred Hitchcock Presents, The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits) as much as Ingmar Bergman. It doesn’t get bogged down in dialogue or make any sort of attempt to explain the cruel pathology of its characters. For an arty, brutal arthouse project it’s admirably lean and brisk. But the trouble is, it doesn’t really have anything to say, other than you can’t really ever know what’s going on inside that pretty little head of hers. We might attribute the protagonist’s murderous behavior to her weird childhood or the viciousness that plays out in the film’s opening moments, but there’s no internal logic underpinning her actions. As they say in small towns all over America, it’s just her way. At least I assume it is the rustic farmhouse Francisca (played as a little girl by Olivia Bond and as a young woman by Kika Magalhaes) grows up in with her mother (Diana Agostini) and father (Paul Nazak). All we really know is it’s remote from civilization, and that it is decorated in a kind of timeless downward-slipping fashion. If not for the vehicles and the buzz of a midcentury television set, it could be set anytime between the 1870s and last week. And, in the way of all young artists smart enough to know they haven’t got that much to say, Pesce effectively suppresses all emotion, allowing us to fill in the blanks, cheating toward a depth that simply isn’t there. A flashback delivers us to the scene of a bizarre home invasion, which leaves Francisca’s mother — who, we are informed was once a doctor in her native Portugal and has given her daughter some anatomy lessons — dead and her assailant (Will Brill) wounded. When her father returns home, they bury Mom, and for obscure reasons, chain her murderer in their barn. They remove his eyes and vocal cords, presumably so he can serve as Francisca’s pet. Obviously this is a film by a guy who had some startling visual ideas — Pesce forces perspective by putting his camera in odd places and sometimes this works to discomfit and disorient the viewer — and very little clue as to how to tell a compelling story. The result is an icy and at times inane exercise in impassive horror. The closest Pesce gets to something human is his unnerving, lingering gaze on the face of a woman Francisca tortures. (Why? Because that is what she does.) In the end, you see the promise and the influences (Michael Haneke, The Night of the Hunter) while being annoyed by the ultimate emptiness of the project. Never has a 76-minute movie seemed so slow. And rarely has a promising young director seemed so compromised by a dull, smug script.

"Dec 2, 2016",POSITIVE," Why, in this day and age, make films in black and white? For Film Comment readers, that might seem a question hardly worth asking; we all know which black-and-white films, whether or not they’re channeling styles of the past, we find arresting, seductive, or poetic in ways they might not have been if shot in color. But sometimes you know a film needs a very limited palette, in order to not show certain things—perhaps grisly things that we’d prefer not even to guess at. Black and white can be the perfect choice for what you might call the “charnel house” movie, of which there’s a particularly striking new example: Nicolas Pesce’s The Eyes of My Mother. Set somewhere in the American hinterland, at some indefinable point in time, the film—backed by Borderline Films, with Sean Durkin, Josh Mond, and Antonio Campos as executive producers—is the story of a young woman named Francisca (Kika Magalhaes). She has grown up on a farm with her Portuguese mother (Diana Agostini), who was apparently a surgeon back in the old country; quite how she ended up married in a remote stretch of U.S. countryside is, like so many things here, tantalizingly left unclear. The first of three chapters—entitled “Mother”—finds Francisca as a little girl (Olivia Bond), learning from Mama about eyes, apparently her specialty as a medic: St. Francis, she tells the girl, “died of an eye condition that also caused psychosis.” (I assumed Pesce had made up this bizarre touch, but apparently not.) Mama also tells her that cows’ eyes are very similar to those of humans: cut to a severed bovine head on the kitchen table, as Mother—with shades of Un Chien Andalou—demonstrates exactly what she means. Then a grinning, white-shirted stranger named Charlie (an immensely disturbing performance from Will Brill) turns up on the front lawn. He’s a reasonable man—he only wants to use the bathroom, he says. In fact, he has something more drastic in mind—and this is the point at which Pesce starts making it hard for us to know exactly what’s going on at any given point, and why. Something awful happens, but whatever it is, it happens off-screen, cloaked in awful silence as young Francisca looks on (the extraordinarily elegant sound design by Patrick Burgess makes especially resonant use of quiet). Now her father (Paul Nazak) comes home—a taciturn, desiccated elder who seems to have just stepped off the canvas of Grant Wood’s American Gothic. He barely says a word, and we don’t see quite what he does, either: but Pesce and co-editor Connor Sullivan cut discreetly to a shot of Francisca washing the bathroom floor, on which there’s a pool of… what? Blood, presumably—but there’s no red to shriek that information at us unequivocally. And that—like later scenes in which Francisca wraps certain unidentified things in plastic—shows why the film had to be in black and white. There are other reasons why Zach Kuperstein’s photography works so perfectly—like the chiaroscuro of the scene in which Francisca and Dad bury her mother at night, surrounded by a brilliant halo of white light. Now things get stranger and darker, and eventually more explicit, so cue SPOILER ALERT: Charlie is still alive and living in the family’s barn. There Francisca, in between doing strange things to him—and here the use of black and white is nothing less than merciful, both to our sensibilities and to his dignity—engages him in artless conversation. “Why us?” she asks. “Why us?” He replies, “You let me in.” Charlie doesn’t get to say a great deal more, for reasons that aren’t quite made overt, but that we can guess at with a shudder. As for Dad, he ends up silent because he’s dead, but Francisca, now a grown woman, keeps him company and looks after him (shades of William Faulkner’s “A Rose for Emily”): she sits him down on the sofa in front of the TV, where there always seems to be a Western playing, cuddles up, kisses him, then gives him a bath, the water sloshing in slow motion. Later, Francisca drives to a bar and brings home a young woman (Clara Wong); things look promising between them in a drawn-out, delicate scene, but a woman with Francisca’s family history is unlikely to be a dream date. Things get darker still in the third chapter, “Family,” as Francisca rebuilds a new family of her own. It starts with her getting a lift from a young woman in a car; Francisca proves the least desirable female chance encounter for a mother and child since François Ozon’s See the Sea. What transpires is acutely painful, at first mainly in psychological terms: the emotional tension ramps up horribly as we hear a baby’s screaming somewhere off screen (in all fairness, anyone sensitive about small children, or indeed about small children’s parents, should be warned not to expect a good time). The elliptical finesse of Pesce’s style sustains itself pretty much consistently throughout the three chapters, and the more elegantly indirect his staging, the more of a tour de force the film is. His and Kuperstein’s great moment is a scene viewed from inside the house looking out through a window. A figure slowly moves away from us, staggering up a hill; off screen, we hear Francisca open a door, take out something metallic from a drawer; after a moment, she passes by on the other side of the window, and eventually is seen pursuing the figure up hill. What adds a further exquisite chill is a little non-narrative detail: a glimpse of white sheets blowing at the very edge of the window. The film becomes a lot less resonant, and less original, in the third part—partly because the horror is more explicit, partly because what earlier happens to a man now happens to a woman—and although what we see is strictly a repetition of Charlie’s fate, it feels more generically punitive. The sound of chains dragging on a floor, the sight of fingernails scraping against splintered wood are hard to take, however beautifully these elements are executed; by this point, I started to wonder whether, for all its grace, The Eyes of My Mother is really that different from the brutish likes of, say, Martyrs (Pascal Laugier, 2008; remade by Kevin and Michael Goetz, 2015). But the most sadistic moment, purely in terms of twisting the knife in the viewer’s sensibility, is the shot of a young boy standing in the doorway to the barn, looking in, the soft animal toy he’s holding silhouetted in the light from behind. It’s the only moment in the film that, perhaps precisely because of that exquisitely limned detail, feels as if it’s crassly pushing our buttons. Pesce undeniably has a vision and a mastery very much his own; this is as idiosyncratic a genre-tweaking debut as Ana Lily Amirpour’s A Girl Walks Home Late at Night (Eyes could almost be retitled A Girl Stays Home Late at Night). Sam Hensen’s production design keeps the period ambivalent: the story appears to be set now, but for much of it, you wonder whether we’re actually in the ’60s, ’50s, even the ’30s; the house’s dark, dully furnished interiors echo both The Night of the Hunter and, perhaps inevitably, Psycho (a doll propped up in a chair presumably stands in for Mother). The nightmare scenario of familial coziness also suggests something like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remade as an exceptionally refined Portuguese art film. In addition, Ariel Loh provides an eerie electric score that feels unsettlingly disconnected from the action, and there are also songs by the great Portuguese fado singer Amália Rodrigues. And there’s an utterly unnerving performance at the center of it all: Kika Magalhaes embodies both distracted menace and a strange, other-worldly fragility. All in all, this is a compellingly strange film, and definitely the real thing, even if it’s finally not 100 percent my thing. It’s a film that sometimes withholds, sometimes shows us too much, and is definitely more effective in the latter mode. Straight-down-the-line horror fans may wonder, though, quite what the delicacy is for, and whether the use of black and white to spare, or to taunt, our nerves is really about understatement, or more a sort of visual euphemism.

"Dec 2, 2016",POSITIVE,"Gruesome and macabre, but it's also powerful work, following through on a vision for psychosis with welcome brevity and a weirdly compelling, periodically loathsome fondness for the unpleasant."
"Dec 2, 2016",NEUTRAL," From
her mother, she learned about the process of surgery and dissection. From her
father, she learned how to keep a person alive in captivity for an extended
period of time. From a stranger, she first heard about the ""amazing""
feeling of killing another human being. There is a sense of doom hanging over
the protagonist of The Eyes of My Mother,
although she doesn't notice it. That's because she thinks all of this is normal. That
line of thought is fascinating, albeit, perhaps, a bit of a stretch within the
actual context of the movie. There is, undoubtedly, a sense of normality to the
everyday life of Francisca, a Portuguese-American girl (played by Olivia Bond)
who becomes a woman (played by Kika Magalhaes) on an isolated farm somewhere in
one of the rural areas of the United States. The farmhouse and the rest of its
acreage, as far as we can tell, are surrounded by a dense forest, to where no
one travels without a reason. The
stranger that the young Francisca meets near the start of the movie has one. His
name is Charlie (Will Brill), and Francisca's mother (Diana Agostini), who was
an eye surgeon in her homeland, notices him talking to her daughter on the front
lawn. Her husband (Paul Nazak), she tells the vagabond, will be home any second
now. Francisca looks at the stranger without fear, possibly because she has
never really met anyone else beyond her parents in this world. She looks as if
she considers him to be a pretty nice man, and that look continues even after
Charlie aims a gun at her mother's face. Francisca
doesn't respond in the expected way, because she has no experience with or,
even, understanding of what is happening. She has only learned a few things in
her secluded life, and a major one is her mother explaining how the human eye
works by dissecting one from a cow's head, which sits, without any to-do, on the
kitchen table during the mother's lesson. This is normal for Francisca. This is
the way things are in life for the little girl. The
movie's first flash of violence offers the method by which writer/director
Nicolas Pesce (his debut) presents the story's abundant brutality. It is only a
flasha shot of the father opening the door to the blood-covered bathroom to
witness Charlie striking at the inside of the bathtub with the grip of the
pistol. We don't see any acts of graphic violence. Pesce frames the few
incidents of violence that occur on screen in such a way that we're instead
focused on facesof the attacker and the victim. It's
the aftermath of those violent acts in which Pesce almost seems to revel, and in
this context, the aftermath is far more disturbing than the act that caused it.
In addition to outright murder, the movie suggests forced surgery, the
dismemberment of corpses, and cannibalism, without ever showing the gruesome
details (There's a minor exception for the second one, in a single shot of
Francisca holding an arm with the sickening sound of a hacksaw grinding bone). We know
all of these things are happening, because Pesce focuses on Francisca cleaning
up after the violence and caring for the victims of her surgical exploits.
""Caring"" would seem to be an odd word to use under these
circumstances, but that is what she does, to the best of her understanding of
the concept. Her first foray into surgery that results in mutilation comes as
the result of wanting to help her father keep the stranger chained up in the
barn quiet. She calls the stranger her ""only friend"" before going to
work, and that seems to be only reason he survives as long as he doeseven
after she stops taking care of her father and, later, his corpse. She's lonely
girl who becomes a very lonely woman. The
central point, if there is one (and that's a big ""if""), appears to be
the distancing approach Pesce takes to this twisted story. In addition to the
lack of any actual violence on screen, the filmmaker, along with cinematographer
Zach Kuperstein, has shot the movie entirely in rich but sterile
black-and-white, which intentionally undercuts the impact of the profuse amount
of blood that goes along with Francisca's demented work. A pool of blood, which
she needs to scrub from the kitchen floor after bringing home a woman from the
bar, might as well be an innocuous liquid. The plastic-wrapped items that she
places in the refrigerator could be anything, really, until we notice that one
looks like a foot. Pesce's
technique keeps the horror partially at bay (not entirely, because the results
of Francisca's surgeries are, indeed, horrifying), and that leaves us to ponder
the tragic normalcy of the central character's circumstances. That's where The Eyes of My Mother falls regrettably short, because this is a
character whom Pesce's screenplay wholly defines by way of atrocities that she
cannot comprehend. We're repulsed, while she remains unmoved, and Pesce offers
nothing to connect those disparate reactions."
"Dec 2, 2016",NEUTRAL," Arthouse horror flick ""The Eyes of My Mother"" actively alienates viewers by presenting episodes in a woman's life from a post-human, God-like perspective. Sometimes. Usually. Probably? Writer/director Nicolas Pesce generally favors black-and-white long takes and static camera compositions, a distinctive style that confronts viewers immediately with its artificial point-of-view. When you see Francisca (Olivia Bond and then later Kika Magalhaes), a shy, emotionally disturbed woman who grows up alone after her parents' sudden death, you don't see her from a subjective point-of-view, but rather from the perspective of a distant, omniscient observer. The film is divided into three chapters, as if we're looking at snapshots from a morbid scrapbook. In that sense, Pesce doesn't encourage viewers to get inside Francisca's head, but rather to see her as a beautiful dust mote: she looks small when filmed in landscape shots that emphasize waving tree branches, distant shapes and the passage of time.  Pesce's style is not necessarily uninteresting, but it does get frustrating when you consider how it's applied to Francisca's narrative. We watch as young Francisca suffers a series of escalating traumas: her mother (Diana Agostini) is murdered by a sadistic traveling salesman (Will Brill) shortly before her father (Paul Nazak) dies quietly in his sleep. Francisca then preserves her father's remains in the bathtub, but only after she ties her mother's murderer up, strips him, and keeps him captive in her basement. Now, you might have a number of questions, like ""Can you repeat that last part"" or ""Why didn't you start with all the weird stuff?"" A better question would be: is this Francisca's story or a story about Francisca? Do events just happen to her, or is she in charge of her story? Short answer: I'm not sure.  Francisca's mother tells us early on that our eyes are where the soul resides. So it's telling that Francisca blindfolds her mother's killer. But what does it mean that we see Francisca's world from a macro scale? Is this how Francisca, a withdrawn character whose selfish actions are downright sociopathic, sees herself? Or maybe this is her way of avoiding seeing herself, like she's trying to excuse her more disturbing actions by putting them in the context of her environment. In her head, Francisca (sometimes) feels small. She (usually) feels the weight of time passing. And her desires are (probably) mysterious to herself. Still, it's hard to tell what exactly ""The Eyes of My Mother"" is trying to show us since it's never clear just how much agency Francisca has. Viewers don't get to see Francisca spending much time with her parents, but we do get the vague sense that she is a product of their personalities. Mother is clinical but warm while father is distant but stubborn. Francisca's brief, pre-traumatic interactions with her parents therefore establish a precedent for actions that cannot be reduced to post-traumatic shellshock. She's not a victim, but she's not all there either. Neither is Pesce's vision. When I watched ""The Eyes of My Mother,"" I spent way too much time trying to figure out why I was looking at certain events, and not simply absorbing information. Note: my difficulty reading the film isn't just an isolated critical disorder specific to people who get paid to think about movies, but rather a problem with the film's dispensation of information. Sometimes, we're clearly seeing events from a subjective point-of-view, as in the opening scene where a trucker discovers a lone woman stumbling around in the middle of the road. But most of the time, it's unclear who's in charge: an authorial voice or a singular character.  We never really know what motivates Francisca's actions, so watching her try to seduce a young woman, or talk about her parents is hard. This isn't a normal story either, with a cogent beginning, middle, and end, so that makes cozying up to Francisca that much more difficult. Instead, Pesce supplies us with a fractured series of images that are so disturbing because they're essentially incoherent. Francisca isn't supposed to be a sympathetic character ... so why am I so bothered by the fact that I couldn't get close enough to understand her? I don't mind not knowing what makes a central character tick so long as I know why I don't understand her. Pesce never gave me that much to go on and deliberately stops short of getting inside his character's head. Pesce and I obviously don't agree on what constitutes effective (or maybe just productive) ambiguity. It's not a bad film ... it just isn't all there.

"Dec 2, 2016",NEGATIVE,"Put aside the photography and Eyes of My Mother is little more than the caboose on the torture-porn train, with Psycho-esque Freudian pretensions."
"Dec 1, 2016",POSITIVE," From the very first shot, Nicolas Pesce’s “The Eyes of My Mother” unsettles as a broken woman staggers along a deserted country road before collapsing in front of an oncoming truck. It will be a long time before we learn who she is or what has happened to her; meantime, there are more than enough horrors to keep us occupied. Sliced into three increasingly dismaying sections — abruptly labeled Mother, Father and Family — and shot in liquid black and white, the story (by Mr. Pesce) details the gradual unraveling of Francisca (Kika Magalhaes), a young Portuguese-American woman. As a child, Francisca coolly absorbed the anatomy lessons that her mother, a former eye surgeon, delivered with the help of animal carcasses. And when a beaming psychopath invades her family’s lonely farmhouse, Francisca observes his bloody purpose with the same clinical detachment. Unfolding with a minimum of dialogue, Francisca’s maturation from watcher to doer would be laughable if performed with less nuance or photographed with less originality. Desperately hugging her father’s corpse in clouded bath water, or swabbing inky pools of blood, Ms. Magalhaes, a former dancer, uses her expressive eyes and graceful limbs to bring the intimacy and sensuality of her actions to vivid life. To Francisca, love and punishment, titillation and torture go hand in hand. Yet what we feel for her is less horror than a bone-deep melancholy. Inside, she’s still a child, albeit one who has been too carefully taught. “The Eyes of My Mother” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Cow bits on the table and human bits in the fridge. "
"Dec 1, 2016",POSITIVE,The Eyes of My Mother regards atmosphere and dread both as its engine and its endgame.
"Dec 1, 2016",POSITIVE," Perspective is everything in horror films. The most important decision any scare flick can make is whether it expects the audience to identify with the villain or their victims. To see through the eyes of the prey (as in Rosemary's Baby, or this year's excellent Under the Shadow) requires only that the director make their situation realistically terrifying, so that we imagine we are frightened for our lives, too. But to assume the eyes of the predator (think of the Dracula movies, or 2013's body snatcher Under the Skin) requires a new set of tools, because the viewpoint challenges us to sympathize with the devil — and to question our own moral compasses in the process. This is a surgical kind of filmmaking that is often unpleasant: giving us eyes we'd rather not have, because we shudder to think what we'll see through them. The exquisite new horror film The Eyes of My Mother, from first-time writer-director Nicolas Pesce, is all about showing you what you'd rather not see. This is true on a visceral level, with implied or explicit imagery of human organs being carved out of still-living bodies like meat before slaughter. (Yes, the squeamish should definitely look away while they still can.) But it's also true on a psychological level, as the film tracks one young woman's evolution from innocent bystander to a horrific crime into the perpetrator of like-minded ones. Perhaps the depravity has always existed within her, but that's for her to know and us to grapple with. At a sleek-n-bleak 76 minutes, divided into three chapters, there's precious little time to waste. We first meet Francisca, the daughter of an American farmer and a Portuguese doctor, as a young girl (Olivia Bond) playing around her remote family farmhouse. (Although the story is set in the modern day, this house is a relic of a distant era, with 50-year-old appliances and floral-patterned wallpaper.) Francisca's doctor mother (Diana Agostini) is teaching her about the human eye by carving up a cow's, and holds up each part for her to inspect. ""Everything we see passes through this,"" she explains. From this compassionate killing comes a decidedly uncompassionate one, as a sinister stranger (Will Brill) coolly walks into the family home and murders Mommy Dearest. When Francisca's nearly-mute father (Paul Nazak) discovers the crime, he betrays no emotion but ties the man up in their barn, allowing the young girl — who seems to never leave the family stead — to lovingly bond with the captive even as she gets out a knife and practices what her mother taught her. (All of this happens without much explanation; dialogue in the film is sparse, and the little there is may make you wish for even less.) As an adult, Francisca continues to glide through her farmhouse with the same childlike reserve and terror. She's played by the brilliant newcomer Kika Malgalhaes, whose glassy-eyed nonchalance to her own actions is more unnerving than the actions themselves. Alone once her father dies, Francisca keeps the stiffening body in the house, continuing to dress and bathe him as she sets three places at dinnertime. And she's still got her detainee, whom she cradles like an infant as she feeds him in the barn. Francisca's actions become increasingly brutal as time goes on; soon she finds less deserving victims, and continues her obsession with peepers. But the film, which is shot in black-and-white, has a merciful way of establishing the details without relishing them. Cinematographer Zach Kuperstein's camera favors the shadows of the barn to the bodies themselves. Often the really nasty stuff happens in the background or in-between cuts, leaving us with mere hints of the aftermath. At every step there's a kind of elegance to the way this character remains grounded by a nightmare logic of family psychology, a quilted patchwork of motivations only she understands. It's a one-upping of the kind of monster-without-motive depiction that came into vogue in the days of Halloween's Michael Myers and never really left. Creating nastiness for its own sake on the horror circuit these days is no longer innovative, but instead comes off as the calling card of the lazy gorehound. The Eyes of My Mother is the rare entry to give depth to its destructive force, to force those new eyes onto us and make us truly believe the terror of what we see."
"Dec 1, 2016",POSITIVE," “The Eyes of My Mother,” Nicolas Pesce’s hypnotically eerie debut feature, builds calmly and quietly to one of the most appalling sequences I’ve seen in a film this year. I’ll keep the details vague; anyone inclined to seek out this movie’s dread-soaked pleasures may as well take their poison straight. Suffice to say that the scene involves a frightened woman, a screaming child and the sort of remote Midwestern abode that, over the course of a swift, indelible 71 minutes, becomes a veritable charnel house of bloody terrors. What makes this particular tableau so disturbing is that it echoes an earlier encounter in the film — the suggestion being that evil, left to its own devices, will inevitably repeat the same chilling patterns from one generation to the next. In the most literal sense, those devices include scalpels, hacksaws and heavy chains, all of which are wielded here with a level of skill matched by Pesce’s own exquisite technical mastery. His sense of horror craftsmanship is at once meticulous and oblique. Working with the cinematographer Zach Kuperstein, he has absorbed a crucial lesson from Alfred Hitchcock’s “Psycho,” filming in lustrous black-and-white images in which shadows are as dark and inky as bloodstains. The editing scheme is similarly restrained, often cutting abruptly from the buildup of a violent scene to its grisly aftermath, and leaving the worst of the carnage to our tortured imaginations. At the center of the movie is Francisca (Kika Magalhaes), a lonely young woman who, it’s perversely suggested at the outset, may have been named after St. Francis of Assisi — one of several religious references that loom incongruously over the story. A cross can be seen hanging on the wall of the farmhouse, and Francisca herself spends much of her time in prayer, though not to any god who might care to listen. Pesce’s deftly sutured screenplay is structured in three chapters (titled “Mother,” “Father” and “Family”), each one adding a fresh wrinkle to a disquieting psychological history. Over a time span of several years, the house bears witness to a series of unfortunate visitors — some of them wholly innocent, like the girl (Clara Wong) who accompanies Francisca home one night. Not so innocent is the leering home invader (Will Brill) who, in one terrifyingly framed interior shot, seems designed to bring back memories of Robert Mitchum in Charles Laughton’s “The Night of the Hunter” (1955). “The Eyes of My Mother” feels indebted to that lyrical horror masterpiece in more ways than one, with its monochrome cinematography, its rural American setting and its rigorous adherence to a childlike perspective. Adults are frighteningly absent from Francisca’s hushed, secluded world. Her father (Paul Nazak) is a stiff, nearly catatonic presence. Her mother (Diana Agostini) is a more compassionate figure who, as we learn early on, once worked as an ocular surgeon in her native Portugal. She trained her daughter depressingly well. At once briskly and deliberately paced, sustaining a precise narrative clarity even as it seems to flow with the logic of a nightmare, “The Eyes of My Mother” confounds expectations and defies easy categorization. Is it a high-art “Texas Chainsaw Massacre”? A feminist rethink of the Ed Gein story? All of the above, perhaps, though it also turns out to be about something much more universal, which is a child’s instinctive desire for companionship — a need that will ultimately be met, and by any means necessary.

"Dec 1, 2016",NEGATIVE," The feature debut of writer-director-editor Nicolas Pesce, “The Eyes of My Mother” looks marvelous. Shot in black-and-white video, the 76-minute horror film benefits from crisp, striking visuals that are well framed and moodily lit. But that’s about all this absurd, illogical and underwhelming thriller has going for it. The thread of the film’s slender narrative follows a disturbed young woman named Francisca from childhood, where she is played by Olivia Bond, into adulthood, where Portuguese-born actress Kika Magalhaes brings a deranged — yet not terribly convincing — intensity to the role. Presumably off her rocker from having witnessed her mother (Diana Agostini) being murdered during the home invasion that opens the film, Francisca has grown into an occasional thrill-killer herself, although the film sometimes relegates these murders to just off camera. When they’re shown, they can be disgustingly squelchy, with sound effects of a knife repeatedly entering and exiting flesh. The crimes are also fairly incomprehensible. Pesce’s spare screenplay offers precious little in the way of psychological insight, other than to speculate that Francisca, like the man who killed her mother (Will Brill), gets some sort of sexual kick out of killing, although through what mechanism this transference has occurred is unclear. Why the film has the title it does — other than the fact that Mom was once an eye surgeon — is another annoying mystery. During an exchange with a woman Francisca has picked up in a bar (Clara Wong), the hapless casualty-in-waiting says, “I don’t do this very often.” “Neither do I,” says Francisca, to which her soon-to-be victim replies, “So, we both have an excuse to be awkward.”"
"Dec 1, 2016",NEGATIVE,"The film benefits from Zach Kuperstein's moody black-and-white cinematography and the stark compositions, but the unrelenting ugliness and senselessness of the piece negate its occasional touches of minimalist beauty."
"Dec 1, 2016",POSITIVE," Making peace is about changing the narrative, they say, and Spike Lee just found a new narrative for the #blacklivesmatter debate. Or actually an extremely old one. With screenwriter Kevin Willmott, he has adapted Aristophanes’s comedy Lysistrata from 411BC, about one woman’s mission to end the Peloponnesian war with a sex strike. The scene is present-day Chicago, whose tough neighbourhoods are nicknamed Chi-Raq (pronounced “shy-rack”) in honour of their bullet-ridden similarity to Iraq, and the fact that the US government spends more on reconstructing Middle East war zones than it would ever dream of spending on its own inner cities. There is in fact a generational debate in this film about whether the term “Chi-Raq” is empowering satire or cynical despair. Like all the dialogue, that debate is in rhyming verse, but it’s not really like rap. The effect is more conventional and theatrical. Nick Cannon plays a rapper and gangbanger, also called Chi-Raq: he is macho, arrogant and up to his neck in the revenge cycle of local gang violence. When the small child of a local woman, Irene (Jennifer Hudson), is senselessly killed in gang crossfire, Chi-Raq’s beautiful girlfriend Lysistrata (Teyonah Parris) is enraged and with the help of Helen (Angela Bassett) reaches out to the opposing gang members’ wives and girlfriends to begin a non-partisan sex strike to end the violence – “No peace, no pussy!” – inspired by the 2002 sex strike organised by Liberian peace activist Leymah Gbowee. They protectively barricade themselves in the local national guard compound (the equivalent of the Acropolis in the original) having Carry On-ishly used their sexy wiles to trick the racist military therein, tie them up and deprive them of their weapons. White Catholic priest Fr Mike Corridan, based on Chicago’s real-life Michael Pfegler, has a grandiloquent sermon at the child’s funeral – a big set piece for John Cusack – in which he becomes hoarse with passion, denouncing state racism and privatised imprisonment as the new Jim Crow. Samuel L Jackson is Dolmedes, the narrator speaking directly to the camera, with his own brand of choric impishness. Spike Lee really hits just a single note in this movie, but he hits it harder and longer and to more effect than many other directors could have done: the movie’s rough edges and angularities make it snag in your mind. It’s conceived in the same bare-knuckle satirical mode as his Bamboozled (2000) or Kevin Willmott’s CSA: The Confederate States of America (2004). The one-dimensional cartooniness sometimes threatens to undermine the seriousness of what the film’s about, yet it’s part of what gives it the blunt force. Chi-Raq is a tactless, haranguing, original piece of work, a movie-musical rant about something important. It interestingly looks like a filmed stage play in the Aristophanic or maybe Brechtian style. It could be further adapted as an opera, but perhaps not exactly rap or hip-hop, although it taps into these styles and other African-American performance traditions. Maybe John Adams would compose the music. It’s fuelled by anger – real, passionate anger about racism, black-on-black violence, identity and respect. And what makes it different isn’t actually style. It’s the fact that it shows women of different ages banding together, organising, taking action. It’s a development that takes Chi-Raq further than the cautious romcom modifications of the Bechdel test. The whole idea of withholding sex isn’t taken seriously in any literal sense, although the connection with male violence is plausible enough. But it’s a narrative mechanism that removes the women, albeit fleetingly, from the context in which they are objectified; it makes them proactive, and interestingly insists on the men’s context as domestic partners. And it is, after all, about that most unfashionable of things, a strike, and a strike that isn’t simply heading for the tragic poignancy of disillusionment and defeat. I’m not being entirely facetious when I say that Chi-Raq could be put in a double bill with Made in Dagenham. Chi-Raq doesn’t work all the time: the scene with the horny Confederate-style general, who refuses to put Democratic presidents’ pictures up on his wall, and certainly not Barack Obama, is pretty unfunny, although its very awkwardness feels like the baffling wrong note of a classical comedy that doesn’t approach the modern funny bone, and it’s part of the strident weirdness. Spike Lee is a veteran of American cinema; he’s a seasoned warrior and there’s a lot of fight – and rage – in this film."
"Dec 1, 2016",NEGATIVE,"Pesce's beautifully photographed but aggressively unpleasant art-house horror film will no doubt have its champions, but it won't find one here."
"Dec 1, 2016",POSITIVE," The Eyes Of My Mother is a grotesque, depraved genre movie with the skin of an art film pulled tightly over its bones. If Ingmar Bergman had helmed The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, it might look something like this exquisite nightmare. Making his confident feature debut, writer-director Nicolas Pesce shoots in a crisp, striking black-and-white and applies hallmarks of “respectable” international cinema—static long takes, passages free of dialogue—to acts almost too unspeakable to describe. To say that this is not a movie for everyone would be to put it mildly: The Eyes Of My Mother is too deliberately paced, even at a brisk 76 minutes, to serve as red meat for midnight-movie crowds, and the poor souls who stumble into their local arthouse theater unawares might stumble out scarred. But those with both strong constitutions and refined tastes—the kind who admire, say, the extreme French horror released this millennium—should mark their calendars accordingly. Told in three chapters, each depicting a different step in a severely fucked-up coming of age, The Eyes Of My Mother is set almost entirely at a secluded farmhouse, somewhere in the neglected backstretches of rural America. Here, young Francisca (Olivia Bond) receives lessons in anatomy from her mother (Diana Agostini), who was once a surgeon in Portugal. The little girl is already perhaps unhealthily interested in death—dissecting a severed cow head could conceivably instill that obsession—when an unwelcome visitor arrives one day to promptly shatter her innocence. (As home-invasion scenes go, this one is extremely upsetting, mostly for how casual it is.) Something snaps in Francisca, trauma hardening into madness, and as she grows into a young woman (Kika Magalhaes), a profoundly disturbing ritual becomes an accepted norm. Pesce is the latest talent to emerge from the New York-based Borderline Films stable, following Antonio Campos (Afterschool), Sean Durkin (Martha Marcy May Marlene), and Josh Mond (James White). He shares with his creative collaborators a clear admiration for the highbrow horror of Michael Haneke and Roman Polanski, not to mention an expert eye and a formidable command of chilling sound design. But none of those filmmakers (all of whom serve as producers here) have leaped this deeply into the darkness. Much of the film’s violence is implied, with shock cuts that either skip past the moment of bloodshed or offer just a lightning-quick glimpse. All the same, once Pesce has established exactly the kind of movie he’s made, The Eyes Of My Mother operates in a sustained state of almost unbearable dread: The threat of atrocity hangs over every languid moment, and we wait on bated breath to see just how bad things are going to get in Francisca’s household of horrors. (Spoiler: Pretty bad.) What Pesce may be after, with all his artfully staged unpleasantness, is a vision of how easy it is to warp an impressionable mind during one’s formative years, while still leaving the basic human desires—for love, for sex, for family—completely intact. (Think the shock comedy of Dogtooth, but with twice the shock and none of the comedy.) The Eyes Of My Mother operates, on a faintly affecting level, as a character study of an intensely lonely psychopath, engendering some sympathy for the kind of lunatic a more conventional thriller would simply treat like a bogeywoman. Mostly, though, the movie just wants to rattle our cages and jangle our nerves. Whether it goes too far in accomplishing that goal—a prolonged depiction of physical and psychological torment in the third act could prove a breaking point—is a matter of twisted sensibility. But there’s no denying that Pesce delivers ugliness with uncommon elegance. Movies designed to make audiences feel really bad rarely look so good."
"Dec 1, 2016",POSITIVE," In horror movies, the most frightening thing is often the inexplicable, awful situations characters find themselves in for reasons that make no sense. Life is full of random terrors, and never knowing why we are suffering is one of the scariest things to contemplate. Writer-director Nicholas Pesce’s gorgeous debut feature The Eyes of My Mother is full of unknowable horrors, courtesy of a protagonist who commits horrific acts without ever justifying or even reflecting on them. And yet in some ways Francisca (Kika Magalhaes) is a sympathetic figure, despite all the pain she inflicts on others. Growing up on an isolated farm, Francisca forms a close bond with her mother, a doctor originally from Portugal who teaches Francisca all about dissecting animals. When a murderous drifter shows up on the family’s doorstep, Francisca gets a different kind of education, and when the movie jumps ahead to Francisca as an adult, living alone on the remote farm, she has combined her knowledges of surgery and torture into a whole new avocation. Pesce shifts the movie’s focus with remarkable precision, connecting Francisca’s status as an apparently innocent victim to her later status as a predator, and muddling the definitions of both in the process. The movie’s visual style is as haunting as its narrative; Pesce and cinematographer Zach Kuperstein shoot in gorgeous, high-contrast black and white, giving the movie an eerie, timeless feel that goes with Francisca’s unnerving presence. Although it takes place in recognizable, realistic settings (the farm, a roadside bar), the movie has the tone of a fairy tale passed down from one teller to another, and Francisca’s actions don’t always make logical sense. Their visceral, emotional power is stronger than logic, though, and with no major new releases in theaters this week, The Eyes of My Mother is perfect home viewing for a chilly night. “Across the Tracks: A Las Vegas Westside Story” was screened at both the Sundance Film Festival and locally at the Plaza, and the film serves ..."
"Nov 30, 2016",POSITIVE," The Eyes of My Mother is a considered bit of filmmaking.  Whether or not the audience accepts everything that is given to them, each and every moment, each and every shot, each and every sound, feels deliberately executed in order to serve the whole.  It is a movie which both lays its main character bare and somehow keeps her concealed at the same time.  We think we know why Francisca is who Francisca is, and why she does what she does, but do we really?  The questions will keep coming and whether or not answers arrive, it still feels worth thinking about."
"Nov 30, 2016",POSITIVE,"Certainly, it stands out among a crowded horror marketplace, and is one of the most unusual horror films I've seen in a while. It is also sometimes very hard to watch."
"Nov 30, 2016",POSITIVE,"There's more than a hint of the classic, doom-haunted The Night of the Hunter to the proceedings, but The Eyes of My Mother has its own soft, insinuatingly creepy voice."
"Nov 30, 2016",POSITIVE," With “The Eyes of My Mother,” that means we’re left with the hope that whatever’s in that glass, we want to believe it’s just tomato juice. Nicolas Pecse’s debut feature as writer-director is a patient, pitiless thriller, a macabre tale set in the rural South where random violence is the stuff of folk legend, and morbid bluegrass ballads. Those are the first sounds we hear in “Mother,” a plaintive bluegrass murder ballad about a killer in “North Caroliner” named Charlie Lawson playing over a trucker’s radio in the mountains of Appalachia. A farm woman (Diana Agonisti) purrs in English and Portuguese to her little girl, teaching her child about the livestock and how cows are like people “in the construction of their eyes.” Before we can say, “That’s interesting,” she’s remembering medical school in Portugal, and showing little Francisca (Olivia Bond) how to dissect bovine eyeballs. Then the crazy-eyed stranger strolls up. He calls himself “Charlie,” he’s full of questions — grinning all the while. And he wants to use their restroom. He’s nervously rebuffed with “My husband will be back any second,” but to no avail. It’s obvious, even before he pulls the pistol. But Mother wasn’t lying. She’s dead in the tub, with poor Francisca shocked and immobile, when her husband comes home. He dispatches the killer, and he and his little girl deal with her mother’s body. And it’s back to “Bonanza.” No law, no cops, and it turns out, no eye-for-an-eye. Because Charlie is kept alive, blinded and totally in the power of little Francisca, who has lots of questions for him at her nightly feedings of the nearly-naked, chained monster. It’s a 76 minute film in which nothing happens quickly, even the opening highway encounter and the murder that precipitates Pesce’s story. The exotic Kika Magalhaes is the adult Francisca, who speaks to her long-dead mother and sometimes hears her voice. She listens to mom’s old fado records — Portuguese laments, tortured torch songs. And she deals with a now-catatonic father and the simpering, aged murderer locked up in the barn. Pesce went for tone here, the kind of horror that comes from a slow death we see coming a long way off. Every encounter leads to tragedy, or would if this was the sort of movie that empathized with its victims. But “Eyes of My Mother” is closer to torture porn than tragedy, with nudity, grisly deaths and random undeserving suffering inflicted on one and all. I like its sense of mystery and the efforts to complicate a simple, grim story that might be told at leisure — it’s awfully slow — over a campfire or in a scratchy bluegrass song.  The movie’s unsolved mysteries — how a Portuguese surgeon ended up on a farm in 1950s Appalachia or how this Charlie creep got his start murdering strangers — are intriguing. Still, there’s no sense being fooled by the arty monochromatic cinematography. Let’s just say that was tomato juice and everybody knows how hard it is to clean up once you’ve spilled it, from a cup or a gallon-sized bottle."
"Nov 30, 2016",NEUTRAL," It’s a shock, in “The Eyes of My Mother,” when you hear someone speak English. This art-horror freak-out is, in fact, American, but it looks like the latest import from Eastern Europe. The images are crisp black-and-white. Scenes are banged out in one, carefully framed, unmoving long take. The actors look like they wandered over from a ’60s Czech New Wave film. And though it involves grisly murders and non-elective surgeries, there’s no gore in sight. To really show that it’s serious, and not mere Midnight Movie junk, the violence is either kept outside the image or elided by jarringly casual jumps to the aftermath. When we briefly visit a middle-of-nowhere, very American dive bar, it’s like we’ve discovered what we thought was an alien planet was Earth all along. This is all according to plan. For his visually assured yet structurally sloppy directorial debut, Nicolas Pesce wants to keep us permanently and in every way off-balance. It’s a kind of origin story, detailing the how of a very screwed-up serial killer. When we first meet her, Francisca is a little girl (played by Olivia Bond) living on a remote, Middle American farm with her crotchedy dad (Paul Nazek) and her wily Portuguese mother (Diana Agostini). One day a twitching stranger (Will Brill) sidles up while dad’s away. He murders mom, and when father returns, he takes him out. But he doesn’t kill him: He chains him inside the barn and leaves him to be the weird new friend of his very lonely young daughter, who realizes he’ll be quieter if she cancels his eyes and tongue. Francisca will age into a young woman, played by Kika Magalhaes, while her father will pass on. Her imprisoned friend will keep on keepin’ on, driven mad, sounding a couple evolutionary steps away from a grunting pig when he’s fed. Gorgeousness of the lighting aside, this is less a horrific image than a horrific idea and, most of all, a horrific sound. That’s really “Mother”’s forte anyway. This isn’t just a “look ma, no gore!” stunt; Pesce knows that violence is more visceral when heard or thought about than seen. He knows that sound activates the brain, forcing viewers to imagine far worse than what they’re seeing. Sometimes it’s a simple question of when to cut.At one point Francisca, flirting with becoming a stock horror movie villain, closes in one of her prey. The scene builds and builds; the music crescendos. Then Pesce abruptly jumps to Francisca wiping up inky blood on her floor and methodically packing up baggies of chopped-up flesh. The strange rhythm of this scene is masterful: Pesce cuts several beats, even several seconds, before we’re expecting Francisca to go in for the kill, leaping forward mid-word. Pesce knows how to work our nerves, all while using the language of Euro art cinema. (A simple shot of the farmhouse bathed in moonlight could be slipped right into a Bela Tarr film.) His fragmented narrative style, complete with chapter titles, helps ensure this is no routine psycho killer romp. Even when Francisca’s stalking future victims, she’s a sad loner — someone warped by isolation and tragedy, stumbling around to find herself, whoever that is. You could say the same thing about the film. It knows what it is stylistically, and it knows how to get its most nightmarish effects. Whether it knows how to get there is debatable. At its worst, is a disorganized collection of ideas and images and sounds — too up for trying anything, to the point where nothing matters. It will become a slasher movie. It will throw in a set piece where Francisca lures a woman home, only to bag another body. It will have Francisca dance weirdly before her father’s corpse. She will randomly seduce the freak she’s kept chained for years. And it will all end with a fat anticlimax that proves it’s about isolated moments, not the big picture — a movie that never quite ties together. But what moments — moments that will haunt your dreams, no matter where they came from."

Fusing classic horror ingredients with haunting gothic imagery and expressionistic dread, “The Eyes of My Mother” mashes its gorgeous components into a shockingly original tone poem. “Loneliness can do strange things to the mind,” says the mother of young Francisca (Olivia Bond) in the opening moments of writer-director Nicolas Pesce‘s striking black-and-white debut. As Francisca grows up in an isolated country house under depraved circumstances, the movie hovers within her mother’s assessment, enacting a nightmarish statement on seclusion with the delicacy of artistic discipline. Exclusively set on the farm and the adjacent empty road, “The Eyes of My Mother” unfolds over the course of three tense chapters — titled “Mother,” “Father” and “Family” — as Francisca matures into a murderous psychopath. But this isn’t your average chronicle of a deranged soul. The pastiche lurks around every corner, including the cheesy horror shows and movies piping into Francisca’s living room from the television set. But the movie reaches well beyond those roots. Equal parts Ingmar Bergman, Tim Burton and Tobe Hooper, “The Eyes of My Mother” suggests “Eraserhead” meets “Repulsion” by way of “The Addams Family,” and yet its story maintains a high degree of unpredictability.  A Spanish-speaking family of ambiguous origin, Francisca’s home is invaded during the opening scenes by a grinning lunatic (Will Brill, whose lanky physique owes a debt to Cesare from “The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari”). His abrupt violent act leads the man of the house to imprison him in the barn, where Francisca adopts him as her pet. Years fly by, and as a young woman (now played by the spindly Kika Magalhaes), Francisca finds herself despondent and communing with the ghosts of her dead parents. As a meditation on loss, “The Eyes of My Mother” casts a lyrical spell, with no greater image than an overhead shot of a despondent Francisca joining her father’s corpse in the bathtub while wailing for him to wake up.  But he doesn’t, and her quest for more company leads to twists involving sexual deviance, frozen body parts and other grisly developments, all captured in lavish chiaroscuro by cinematographer Zach Kuperstein. Shot on film, the scenery alternates between the eerily warm feel of the household interiors and the ominous shadows of the barn. The mesmerizing choreography of the camera offers more surprises than the plot. One extraordinary setup involving an attempted escape is seen entirely through the window of the bedroom; lit by moonlight, it generates a heavier ominous quality than any gory closeup. In fact, much of the violence remains off-screen, as Pesce taps into viewers’ imaginations. At once pathetic and terrifying, Francisca is a movie monster for the ages.  While certainly an impressive debut that crams its elegance into an efficient 77 minutes, “The Eyes of My Mother” shows a few rough edges indicative of a newcomer. Some of the abrupt transitions feel like copouts, and the finale arrives a bit too abruptly to match the strength of the suspense leading up to it. The stylistic intensity of the project constantly runs the risk of outshining deeper possibilities, but even when all the cards are on the table, it’s a spectacular view. Whereas Rob Zombie’s “The Devil’s Rejects” generated its scariest bits around a family of maniacs by sympathizing with them, “The Eyes of My Mother” maintains a more powerful degree of intimacy with its subject. Francesca may be a homicidal killer, but that doesn’t stop the movie from hovering in her psychological instability.  The first feature produced by members of the Borderline Films collective — directors Antonio Campos, Sean Durkin and Josh Mond — “The Eyes of My Mother” is a natural fit for the trio’s brand. From “Martha Marcy May Marlene” to “Simon Killer” and this year’s “Christine,” these filmmakers have fixated on probing the subjective experiences of alienated characters. With “The Eyes of My Mother,” Pesce capably takes on that task to create a wondrous tapestry of emotional disorientation. It’s not a typical family drama, but Francesca doesn’t know that. With few exceptions, the movie’s right there with her to the very end.  By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

"Nov 29, 2016",POSITIVE," This review originally ran in January 2016, after The Eyes of My Mother played Sundance. We are republishing it now that the movie is in wide release. A sick, simmering nightmare of a movie, Nicolas Pesce’s The Eyes of My Mother feels like what might have happened if Michelangelo Antonioni and Shirley Jackson had collaborated on a torture-porn flick. I mean that in the best possible way. Though filled with grisly, grotesque images, this is a film that doesn’t shock you with cheap scares; rather, it claws into your subconscious and lingers there. Maybe that’s why the film has had a low-key but persistent buzz throughout this year’s Sundance, ever since its premiere early in the fest. It wasn’t one of those movies to which one heard loud, immediate reactions. But every day, more and more people would ask me if I’d seen it, and what I thought, and how I had to see it, and how they themselves weren’t sure if they loved it or hated it. Shot in widescreen black and white, the film unfolds in tense, terse fashion. In a small farm out in the middle of nowhere, a mother (Diana Agostini, her face gaunt and her eyes cavernous) tells her young daughter Francesca (Olivia Bond) about how when she was studying to be a surgeon back in Portugal, they would experiment on cow eyes, because of their similarity to human eyes. They slice open one such cow eye, and mom holds it up: “Everything we see passes through this,” she says. Appropriately, Pesce’s film plays with the seen and the unseen – it cuts away at key moments, obfuscates our view, plays with our vision. Francesca’s life is forever changed when an eerie drifter named Charlie (Will Brill) comes to visit, nervously asks to use the bathroom, then pulls out a gun and points it at mother. What follows next is disturbing, to be sure, but it’s also presented in Pesce’s oblique, elegant style — which pulls us away from the immediate horror of what’s happening and instead sends the movie into the realm of the symbolic, as if we’re witnessing deep, unspoken fears suddenly made real. As the film leaps forward in time, we see Francesca (now played by Kika Magalhaes) grow up, but she still remains something of a child. She continues to live on the farm, reenacting the rituals of her childhood and finding it hard to let go of the past. If it sounds like I’m being vague here, that’s because I am — not just because I don’t want to give away what happens, but also because to describe the events of the film would make it sound like the one thing it’s not — an exploitative horror flick. While Pesce occasionally offers up a graphic image or a nauseating, disturbing sound, most of the film is defined by what we don’t see, or hear. The twisted dream logic of Francesca’s actions also prevents the film from ever slipping towards straight horror. Some at Sundance compared the film to The Babadook, but it lacks that film’s more overt scares and lived-in milieu. No, a more appropriate comparison point might be Under the Skin. You don’t “care” for these characters or worry about their fates, which is not to say that you don’t care for what happens in the film itself; the dimly lit photography, the elegant framing, the ominous soundtrack, and the incantatory dialogue all serve to create a gripping, unreal atmosphere. One could even say that the mood Pesce weaves is more of a character than any actual person in his film. And somewhere in The Eyes of My Mother’s sustained longing for the past, for preservation and for stasis, it captures our collective fear of the unknown, of moving on, of growing up."
"Nov 29, 2016",POSITIVE," Imagine the body-horror of Hostel pitted with the terrifying premise of Oldboy and you’re getting somewhere close to writer/director Nicolas Pesce’s disturbing debut, The Eyes of My Mother. Part German Expressionism, part American Gothic, this austere black-and-white feature is fuelled as much by ideas as it is by the power to shock. In small-town America, young Fransisca (Kika Magalhaes) watches helplessly as her mother is brutally murdered by a stranger (Will Brill) whom she foolishly invited inside. When her father returns home, he stabs the murderer, but instead of letting him die he comes up a more frightening plan – chaining him up in their neighbouring barn. First, though, he removes his eyes. The now disfigured young man, named Charlie, becomes Fransisca’s companion as she grows up from a child to adulthood. “Why would I kill you? You’re my only friend” she slyly whispers to the naked, cadaverous body as if to justify keeping him prisoner. Soon, he becomes her de-facto lover – until he tries to escape. Later, as an adult, Fransisca lures innocent victims back to her isolated ranch. Any sympathy we might have had for her evaporates when an innocent party – a mother – in the wrong place at the wrong time – gets shacked up by her in the same barn. The claustrophobic second half of the film takes us into even weirder and more unsettling territory. The Eyes of My Mother is in essence an exploitation flick about loneliness and social isolation. One disorientating factor in Fransisca’s story is her own mother’s history as a surgeon in Portugal – in the film’s opening scene we see her dissect a cow’s eyes (“In Portugal we dissect cattle, here they dissect people.”) Fransisca’s dedication to her mother means that she dissects her every victim, using chopped up body parts to feed the shackled prisoners she’s kept alive, who are so desperately hungry that they’ll eat anything. Yet this is also a story of wildly misplaced morality. Fransisca is raised by a strict Catholic, and the film explores her relationship with a world that doesn’t fit the narrative she’s been brought up with. She believes her actions are part of some divine providence – epitomised by Pesce’s frequent references to religious iconography – rather than the deeds of a profoundly disturbed young woman. It all makes for an extraordinarily assured debut, placated only by the occasional whimsies to caricaturist horror. With cinematographer Zach Kuperstein, Pesce shoots in crisp monochrome that allows some of the violence to play out unseen in the shadow, ramping up the terror rather than pacifying it. Plus, Pesce’s direction is deft enough to recognise Fransica as a victim of circumstance. Kika Magalhaes lends a vampiric presence to the central role, ready to suck her victims into a life of servitude inhabited only by nightmares. Indeed, this chilling film may just occupy yours.

"Nov 29, 2016",POSITIVE," A grizzly tale of American Gothic served up with an unexpected dash of moodily melodic Portuguese fado, The Eyes of My Mother is both strange and strangely enthralling. Shot, digitally, in beautifully composed black-and-white, this darkly comic feature about a young girl growing up in violent times is set on an isolated American farm that looks like it could be just down the road from where Charles Laughton’s classic and equally unclassifiable The Night of the Hunter was set. Though this won’t be any distributor’s idea of a surefire commercial hit, a small boutique operation should consider investing in a relationship with music video prodigy Nicolas Pesce, a clear talent who makes his feature debut here and whom the industry should keep an eye on. The beauty of the film — as well as one of the main reasons most mainstream audiences will resist it — is that it’s not very dialogue-heavy and refuses to connect the dots between one scene and the next too explicitly, leaving it up to the viewers to draw their own conclusions. After an enigmatic opening that the narrative will circle back to later, the film’s first part, called Mother, focuses on a cute and innocent-seeming little girl, Francisca (Olivia Bond), who lives with her Portuguese mother (Diana Agostini), a former surgeon, and father (Paul Nazak) on an isolated cattle farm in an unspecified time and place (the film was shot in Cooperstown, New York). An eerie-looking and oddly acting stranger called Charlie (Will Brill) insinuates his way into the house when Dad isn’t home and commits a horrible crime in front of the little girl. Pesce cleverly keeps most of the actual violence offscreen, with sound effects, suggestive cuts and outwardly quiet but entirely horrifying images — such as little Francisca mopping blood off a tiled floor — doing most of the heavy lifting. What slowly emerges is a sense of the problematic psychological makeup of Francisca, who has had to grow up after not only an enormously traumatic experience but also without any role models. This seems to have led her to simply copy the behavior of the adults around her, including the deranged Charlie and her aging father, whose methods of dealing with monsters isn’t exactly what could be described as gentle, either. The contribution of cinematographer Zach Kuperstein, with his precise framing and his and Pesce’s sharp sense of mise-en-scene, can also not be underestimated. If anything, naysayers will suggest the film is an exercise in style that lacks an easily identifiable narrative throughline or likeable protagonist, though champions can counter that that says more about their unwillingness or inability to enter into a dialogue with the film’s rich gallery of images, sounds and sensations than anything about the film’s inherent qualities. Hopefully, post-screening discussions over the film will at least stay civilized and everyone will leave their saws, knives, needles and shackles at home. Those things can get you in a right mess. "
"Nov 29, 2016",POSITIVE,I've been watching horror films since I was three years old. They've never given me nightmares. Until now.
"Nov 28, 2016",NEUTRAL," Shot completely in black and white, “The Eyes of My Mother” follows Francisca, a young girl living in seclusion on a remote farm with her eye surgeon mother and farmer father. After her mother is murdered by an armed stranger, Francisca (Olivia Bond) is left alone with her father (Paul Nazak), who chains his wife’s murderer in the barn. After her father dies, Francisca keeps his corpse around for company, making it obvious that seeing her mother’s murder has left Francisca quite disturbed. Told in three distinct sections, “The Eyes of My Mother” follows Francisca as she grows up and takes up her own hobbies — like doing unspeakable things to that stranger in the barn. Kika Magalhaes, who plays the older version of Francisca, is quite an amazing find. The camera is captivated by her, whether she is doing mundane things or randomly murdering anyone who follows her home. The tone and delivery of her scarce dialogue is quite distinct. Certainly, parallels can be drawn between Pesce’s film and horror classics from Hitchcock’s “Psycho” to “Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer.” The opening scene of a woman running across a deserted highway draws immediate comparisons to the low budget classic “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” — but this is a slower and more brooding piece of filmmaking. In some ways, Pesce’s film is often more disturbing for what it doesn’t show than what it does, with the last act probably the hardest to watch. Even if you hate the movie’s premise or the way it’s executed, you have to give some credit to the brilliantly stark cinematography by Zach Kuperstein and the captivating score by Ariel Loh, both of which keep the viewer on edge. It’s fairly clear that Pesce is an auteur in the making and maybe some will be able to appreciate “The Eyes of My Mother” for its artistry and its unique portrait of loneliness. The film’s snail-like pace ends up being its undoing, though, since it often takes a long time for anything significant to happen. Despite its artistic merits, “The Eyes of My Mother” is a very hard movie to recommend to just anyone, because it’s not for the squeamish and even those with strong stomachs may find themselves getting bored at times."
"Nov 28, 2016",POSITIVE," At a secluded farmhouse, a mother and her young daughter are approached by a smiling stranger. He is invited in, and from that small act of kindness a history of nastiness unfurls. It’s neither softened nor stunted by the years; on the contrary, the child grows into a self-possessed young woman (Kika Magalhaes) who continues to perpetrate savage acts as if they were social niceties. Unfamiliar cuts of meat are kept in the fridge. Nicolas Pesce’s début feature, strikingly shot by Zach Kuperstein in black-and-white, is curt and crisp, running less than eighty minutes; yet it seems to crawl along, so punishingly grim are the details of bodily harm, and so intent is Pesce on the trancelike behavior of his heroine. Although we are in America, both the place and the period feel vague and insecure, and the movie, for all its physicality, shrivels up at the slightest touch of logic. All of which, to be fair, is likely to lure rather than to repel any Poe-steeped addicts of horror; budding necrophiliacs, too, will find themselves instructed and entertained. (In limited release.)"
"Nov 27, 2016",NEGATIVE," In The Eyes of My Mother, writer-director Nicolas Pesce flatlines all emotionality and intellectualism, offering images and scenarios that exist in a void of contrivance. There are no reasons for the characters to do what they do here beyond the necessity of the jerry-rigged plot, which borrows from dozens of other sources and abounds in ludicrous dime-store Freudian intrigue and Oedipal obsessions that are common of self-consciously arty horror films. There’s no discernable theme or resonance either, beyond a smug belief in the inherent truthfulness of cruelty for cruelty’s sake that suggests hours spent studying the early work of Michael Haneke, or recent films like Goodnight Mommy and Tom Six’s Human Centipede sequels. The Eyes of My Mother is yet another film about a sexually frustrated misfit who dismembers and tortures people in an effort to preserve her incestuous familial arrangement. Francisca (Kika Magalhaes) is a beautiful gothic brunette with supernaturally large eyes who lives in a remote farmhouse with her father (Paul Nazak). As with the homes of most crazy people in pretentious horror movies, the habitat is untouched by modernity, suggesting a life spent forever stuck in the hypocritically repressive fugue state of the 1950s-era United States. We learn in a long prologue that Francisca’s mother (Diana Agostini) was beaten to death by a home invader (Will Brill), whom Francisca now keeps locked in a barn as a surrogate dog and sex slave, his eyes removed and vocal cords severed. Her mother, once a doctor in Portugal, dissected cow heads with Francisca, teaching her the structure of human eyes, so as to contextualize and justify the atrocities that Pesce eventually springs. As gross as the Human Centipede sequels are, Six understands that he’s committing an act of contempt. Said contempt is opportunistic and pointless, but everyone indulging Six realizes that he at least knows where he stands. By contrast, Pesce works in a mode of faux-religious solemnity that’s obnoxiously self-deceiving, considering the lack of curiosity and empathy that he displays toward his characters, who regard death with a cold and dull impassivity that’s meant to bolster the film’s uncompromising rep. Pesce appears to believe that his exploitation tactics are kin to the work of Ingmar Bergman and Béla Tarr: The black-and-white cinematography is composed of harsh shadows and stark angles, so that we sense that an existential point is being landed, though there’s actually nothing beneath the shock theatrics. The torture scenes are the only moments in the film that are staged with sensorial vividness, with Pesce lingering—and with a fascination that’s appallingly sexual—on a close-up of the knotted face of a woman as she gurgles through her violated vocal cords and Francisca binds her. Though The Eyes of My Mother strives to be audacious and galvanizing, it’s easily shaken off as an exercise in stunted necrophilia erotica. Francisca is a fetish object rather than a character, and Pesce moves her through a variety of lifeless poses, often with show-off camera placements that absurdly assume the perspectives of inanimate objects. In the end, the film’s obsession with bondage and perverted desire feels borrowed rather than lived-in, suggesting a child’s retelling of a salacious joke."

A man comes up a long, dusty road to a house on a hill. That could be the start of many horror films – in fact, it is – but none of them do what debuting writer-director Nicolas Pesce manages in his shocking ‘The Eyes of My Mother’. We quickly notice that the man in question is unwell: giggly, wide-eyed, armed with a huge pistol and the desire to flaunt it. But still, even he doesn’t know he’s just invaded a home where the slicing of flesh is a way of life. There’s a young girl living there, and she’s a fast learner. Excuse the vagueness, but some surprises are worth keeping. Shooting in ominous black and white (often from a distance), Pesce has crafted an exquisite creepshow that pays homage to the mightiest of fear films, Tobe Hooper’s relentless ‘The Texas Chainsaw Massacre’, while still having a coppery taste all its own. The movie skips through the years; sceptical viewers will wonder if such domestic brutality could go unnoticed for so long. But of course it can: ‘The Eyes of My Mother’ already feels unwittingly timely, a tale from the American heartland tinged with revenge, sex and suffering. If you can stomach the fear, go. Confident hands created this film, and its nightmare will linger for weeks.

"Nov 22, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A puerile film laden with gruesome imagery but lacking in tension, character or a connecting purpose."
"Nov 18, 2016",NEGATIVE," The Eyes of My Mother, written and directed by Nicolas Pesce, may be the gloomiest horror movie ever made. There are no monsters, vampires, zombies, ghosts, demons, or any kind of supernatural happenings. But the film contains some of the most horrific acts you can imagine. And Pesce leaves much of that to your imagination -- which as you know -- can take you to very ugly places.  Filmed in black and white with many scenes so dark you have to strain hard to see whats happening, this movie left me feeling drained and down in the dumps. Still, horror movie buffs may be pleased, mostly because of the haunting performance of Kika Magalhaes as the young woman, who -- as a child (portrayed by darling Olivia Bond) -- sat in one American farmhouse room listening to a stranger butcher her mother in the adjoining bathroom.  Magalhaes plays the adult Francisca, who still misses her mother (Diana Agostini), a former eye surgeon in Portugal. Franciscas mother taught her about human anatomy, and this made her curious to learn more. But how she manages to do so is quite frightening. Shes often seen scrubbing blood stains on the floor. Francisca says very little. When she does talk, its mostly about -- or to -- her dead mother. And theres never any doubt about what she will do if anyone gets in her way. "
"Nov 16, 2016",POSITIVE," The directorial debut for writer/director,/editor Nicolas Pesce, a former music video director, is an auspicious oneHe tells a weird haunting tale of loneliness as bringing on severe psychological issues. Filming it in an atmospheric black-and-white and using the remote countryside woods for the dark setting, leaves the serial killer drama with an unsettling moody atmosphere.On a secluded farm the young girl Francisca (Olivia Bond) watches intently as a crazed home invader, Charlie (Will Brill), savagely murders her beloved former eye surgeon Portuguese mom (Diana Agostini). Her uncommunicative father (Paul Nazak) comes home to overcome Charlie while he’s still hacking away and savagely beats him. The girl drags Charlie to the barn and puts him in chains. He buries his wife on the grounds without notifying the authorities. Meanwhile the traumatized Francisca fearing to be alone, keeps the captive alive by secretly feeding him and sewing up his wounds. When she becomes a young adult (Kika Magalhaes, Portuguese actress) her aging dad dies. The girl tries to converse with her dead mom for guidance and is led on a dark path, as she murders Charlie. Now a deranged psychopath killer, Francisca murders a young woman (Clara Wong) she invites to the farm, who is scared off by her strangeness and overbearing need for companionship. Another vic is a young mother (Flora Diaz), who is chained and blinded by a surgical eye operation she learned from her mother, when she tries to take back her kidnapped child. The baby boy Antonio (Joey Curtis-Green) is lovingly raised by her for a few years before the fable finds a way to end everyone’s misery when her captive boy disobeys her command to never go in the barn and goes there.  The grizzly Gothic tale  is a unique shocker in grimness, that’s effective because of its strangeness, being so  well-executed and so superbly acted."

"Oct 8, 2016",POSITIVE," Those seeking to be awed, alarmed and unnerved at the 60th London Film Festival should convert to the Cult strand. This year’s selection is disparate, although sylvan settings (as Cult programmer Michael Blyth ) and psychological dysfunction form recurrent motifs. Here is an initiatory taste of five recommendations (with a curious preponderance of Irish titles: has Celtic cinema turned cult-ward?). That said, this year’s programme is so good that it proved impossible to resist mentioning some of the other Cult titles, at least in passing. Gilles Marchand’s boys’-eye-view psychodrama Into the Forest (Dans la forêt) and Taneli Mustonen’s true-crime exploitationer Lake Bodom (Bodom) both – in very different ways – exploiting the interplay of campfire myth and cold, wet reality in the Swedish woodlands. Both are excellent – but my favourite of the Cult programme’s timbered titles is Lorcan Finnegan’s Without Name, for the way it uses a strong sense of place to evoke the geography of a middle-aged man’s splintering mind. Lost between fragmenting marriage and non-committal adultery, and hoping for some quiet time apart, Eric (Alan McKenna) takes private work surveying Irish forestland so ‘unspecific’ that its local name translates as ‘without name’ – even as he begins to question the legality and morality of what he is doing. In this creaking, verdant place, “like a church” and haunted by its own peculiar folklore, Eric devours earth-born mushrooms, and starts believing his predecessor’s claims that the flora communicate through their own natural grammar. Much like Corin Hardy’s The Hallow (2015) and Wyndham Price’s Crow (2016), Without Name hedges its bets between psychological, ecological and supernatural frames for its mysterious narrative. Through disorienting pull focuses and the hallucinatory play of light and shadow on tree trunks, Lorcan conjures the suggestion of a pagan presence in this eerily numinous maze of branches, and lets the viewer, along with Eric, become lost in the woods. As Eric begins to talk to the trees (with all that is entailed by the phrase), his madness – or is it arboreal possession? – plays out amid a clash of ancient and modern, of nature’s cyclicality and humanity’s linear progress, in a psychogeographic space on no map. This year’s Cult programme also features several films concerned with psychotic killers. With the aptly titled Creepy, for one example, Kiyoshi Kurosawa returns to the blank-eyed genre neighbourhoods of his earlier Cure (1997) and Bright Future (2003), revealing a special, hidden kind of murderer whose hunting ground is the fragile structure of the Japanese family itself, and who could live right next door. I Am not A Serial Killer, directed by Billy O’Brien (Isolation), is another. Max Records is probably best known for playing the little boy who runs away to live with the monsters of his mind in Spike Jonze’s Where the Wild Things Are (2009). Now a teenager, Records is in a sense reprising and maturing that role, as he once again plays a character negotiating with demons both internal and external. Cursed with a name that suggests both serial killer John Wayne Gacy and a lethal weapon, diagnosed sociopath John Wayne Cleaver seems destined to become a career slasher – but as the title of this adaptation of Dan Well’s 2009 novel implies, Records’ character rejects his destiny. As obsessed with serial killers as with people’s insides, John helps his single mother (Laura Fraser) with the embalming in their family funeral home, and struggles to suppress his urges to kill others. As our adolescent antihero, on the cusp of carving out his own identity, investigates a spate of bizarre local murders, he will see in geriatric neighbour Crowley (Christopher Lloyd) both his dark reverse and possibly his future. If, for all his emotional indifference and heartless proclivities, John remains a likeable character who would not be out of place in many a quirky coming-of-age indie, this is because O’Brien’s film casts a refreshingly sympathetic eye over the monster within and, even when the narrative takes a supernatural turn, still grounds everything in human choice. The result is an affectionate, often funny look at small-town slaughter, with a killer protagonist for whom it is all too easy to root. I Am not a Serial Killer is not, however, this year’s only Cult offering to be part-set in a family-run morgue. For in André Trollhunter Øvredal’s The Autopsy of Jane Doe, screening as part of the LFF Gala, father-and-son coroners (Brian Cox, Emile Hirsch) spend a dark night of the soul examining a corpse (Olwen Catherine Kelly) inscribed with a long, repeating American history of male abuse against women. It’s an off-kilter ghost story with a strong feminist subtext half-buried in its foundations. The speaker is removalist and aspiring actor Larry de Cecco (played with repellent unctuousness by co-writer Martin Bacigalupo), asking about his casting headshot. Larry, however, is not his real name, but one of several identities that he will adopt in the film as readily as he practises his roles, hoping to find a part that will eventually ring true. Carles Torras’s Callback is a character study of a sociopathic creep akin to the Spanish-speaking protagonists from Tony Manero (2008) or Sleep Tight (2011). Yet, in keeping with its status as a Spanish production set in New York, Callback is preoccupied with a particular brand of ruptured identity that the US can inspire in the sort of driven immigrants and outsiders once played by Al Pacino or Robert De Niro (both obliquely referenced in the film). Even when he is not reciting motivational lines from the advertisements for which he auditions, Larry talks robotically in borrowed catchphrases and false platitudes, as he struggles to fit into an American dream that seems so much more attractive in commercials than in reality. Nicolas Pesce’s striking debut The Eyes of My Mother is also concerned with an outsider’s madness in America. In a remote farmhouse, little Francisca (Olivia Bond) is reared bilingually by her Portuguese mother on tales of saintly isolation and practical exercises in eye surgery – until a psychopathic stranger (Will Brill) comes a-visiting and destroys the family forever. Now an adult, Francisca (Kika Magalhaes) longs to stave off loneliness with a family of her own – but the austere little world that she has maintained and the limited experience that she has of what lies beyond see a mythic tragedy unfolding in the midst of modern America. Pesce’s colourless presentation and elliptical editing offer a blinkered perspective on events which replicates both the protagonist’s ocular obsessions and the mutual incomprehension of Francisca and those she encounters. For this is a film in which a succession of horrors take place just out of sight, perpetrated by a (metaphorically) myopic heroine as blind as her victims. [For a different take on maternity and madness in the Cult programme, it’s well worth checking out Jiri Seder’s feature debut The Noonday Witch (Polednice), whose day-lit rural horror merges and modernises both a Czech folk tale and the myth of Demeter and Persephone.] The speaker is Joseph Solomon (Steve Oram), an experienced occultist who is guiding Sophia Howard (Catherine Walker) through an elaborate ritual to help her speak once more with the dead son whose killers she is unable to forgive. Bourgeois, Catholic Sophia is not yet being straight with Joseph about her full intentions, and has doubts about everything (including Joseph), while the tracksuit-sporting, often brutish medium comes with his own demons – but all this will become part of Sophia’s strange journey towards personal transformation. There are countless films that have incorporated magick rites into their narrative, typically involving the brief conjuring of demonic entities around a ouija board or pentagram – but for Liam Gavin’s extraordinary feature debut A Dark Song, my favourite film of this year’s Cult strand, those rites constitute almost the entire duration and substance of the film. As Sophia and Joseph seal themselves into an isolated Welsh country house together, and spend many months repeatedly trying to open the mystic doorway to Sophia’s guardian angel, the result is an intensely intimate chamber piece in which two flawed but committed individuals work through problems all at once worldly, psychological and spiritual via an irrational yet rigorously methodical process. A Dark Song is a cult film precisely because it casts Sophia and viewer alike as initiates on a solemn, semi-religious quest. Amid the personality clashes, cabin-fever claustrophobia, class conflict, sexual tension and acts of transgression, there are also supernatural incursions, momentary miracles and awe-inspiring epiphanies, all serving as a stylised study of damage and rebirth in extremis. It is sublime, uncanny and in the end deeply moving – and there is nothing else out there remotely like it."
"Aug 15, 2016",POSITIVE," Like an intoxicating fever dream, writer/director Nicolas Pesce’s The Eyes of My Mother is unlike any film I’ve seen in quite some time, akin to a nightmare you just can’t quite shake off. Breathtakingly shot in black and white, Pesce’s unsettling character study is as heartbreaking as it is depraved, making for an experience that will stay with you long after its gut-wrenching finale. The Eyes of My Mother starts off innocently enough, introducing a young Francisca (Olivia Bond) as she picks flowers and roams the remote farm she shares with her mother (Diana Agostini) and father (Paul Nazak). There’s a gentleness to Francisca’s world, where she picks flowers and observes nature, but there’s also a bluntness to it as well, as her mother is a former veterinarian who teaches her daughter some of her methods (including decapitating a cow), making for an interesting juxtaposition right from the start. One day while her father is away, Francisca and her mother are met by a stranger (Will Brill) who has a sinister plan in mind for the matriarch. And when Francisca’s dad returns home, he finds the maniacal visitor doing some unspeakable things to his wife, prompting him to take the mysterious man hostage and chain him up inside their barn. Pesce frames his directorial debut into chapters (“Mother,” “Father,” and “Family”), giving us a distinct idea of the three phases of Francisca’s life as we see her transition into a stunning and alluring woman (Kika Magalhaes) who wants nothing more than to find someone she can share her time with. Being isolated away from most of the world on her farm has made her yearn for any kind of human connection, and we see, over time, how those yearnings play out in deadly ways, making for an intimate and unforgettable examination of this woman’s remote world. With Pesce and cinematographer Zach Kuperstein’s decision to shoot The Eyes of My Mother in black and white, the film has an ethereal and timeless look to the point where it’s almost too beautiful to be about someone as deranged as Francisca. Magalhaes is breathtaking in her role, too, a haunting mix of doe-eyed innocence and danger that reminds me of a young Felissa Rose in Sleepaway Camp or even Jessica Harper from Suspiria. Magalhaes gives a lovely and complicated performance that is among the best acting work I’ve seen this year. The Eyes of My Mother is a stunning debut feature from Pesce and one of the most unforgettable films I’ve seen in 2016. A hauntingly provocative slice of Gothic cinema that sticks with you long after it ends, the film brims with a palpable sense of dread and unease from start to finish. To me, The Eyes of My Mother is a must-see effort for any horror fan out there who likes to dig a little deeper with their genre fare, as it rattled my psyche in ways I didn’t think were still possible.

"Jul 22, 2016",POSITIVE," A shocking, violent act causes a young girl’s life to develop in profoundly disturbing ways in this incredibly assured and powerful debut from writer-director Nicolas Pesce, which played at Fantasia Film Festival earlier this week. Beautifully shot in crisp black and white, The Eyes Of My Mother deftly combines sharp, shocking moments of horror, skin-crawling discomfort, and the surprisingly emotional journey of a damaged woman. Young Francisca lives with her parents in an isolated house near the woods. Her mother is a Catholic surgeon, whose stories about St Francis and the importance of eyes are interrupted when a stranger (the hypnotically creepy Will Brill) arrives at their home while her husband is out and brutally murders her. The father returns home, and the way in which the murderous intruder is handled is the first step on a dark path for Francisca. The striking cinematography is what will hit you first, and it plays into an unnerving mood that carries throughout. This feels like an uncertain time and place, while the film is caught somewhere between a Grimms fairytale, Polanski-esque unease and Pascal Laugier’s Martyrs. The comparison to that French extreme horror film is more to do with the searing images of captive men and women than any gore content; Pesce is actually very restrained with what he shows in terms of blood and guts. Instead, we get unforgettable and chilling moments, such as a corpse being lowered into a bath to be cleaned, or a quick cut from a situation on the verge of violence to Francisca cleaning blood from the kitchen floor. Kika Magalhaes is brilliant in the lead role, beautifully serene and almost passive (until she’s not), and the film somehow manages to make this character almost sympathetic. By refusing to break from Franscisca’s perspective for the vast majority of the running time, we’re there with her as she desperately searches for some kind of belonging or connection, either with a partner, friend or new family member. Her methods are brutal and terrifying, but the beautiful cinematography, assured performances and excellent soundtrack create an uneasy but compelling atmosphere in which it’s very difficult to look away, even when we know that something awful must be about to happen. The deliberate pacing will put some viewers off (even though it’s less than 80 minutes), and some may complain that it’s a little hollow, but as a cinematic experience, this is truly impressive, and it will stay with you."
"Jul 19, 2016",POSITIVE," The beautiful thing about horror is its ever-shifting form. A heavy-metal gorevalanch like Deathgasm defines one extreme of the genre (raucous over-the-top fun), while A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night (black-and-white, emotional arthouse) spans the opposite side of a wide-reaching spectrum. Horror can seep into any situation, like how first-time filmmaker Nicolas Pesce corrupts a child’s youth in his ever-haunting debut, The Eyes Of My Mother. Black and white? Check. Ominously forbidding and deeply disturbing? Oh yeah. Horror by way of arthouse exploration? You betcha. Hey, who said genre films can’t get experimental every now and then? Pesce satiates his experimental hunger in The Eyes Of My Mother by toying around with extreme minimalism. Black and white shading pushes performances front-and-center. Sparse dialogue puts a focus on emotion, tension and atmosphere. Modest settings and only a handful of characters highlight the essence of tainted youth. Every single one of Pesce’s decisions play into a streamlined experience that runs under 80 minutes, which ensures that “artistic freedom” never becomes overwhelming or reckless. Pesce aims to manifest a slowly-creeping sense of unshakable dread, and accomplishes this warped sensationalism through a creeping, deeply rooted destabilization of Francisca’s being. Of course, Pesce’s visionary horror would be wasted without an enchanting lead from Kika Magalhaes – or the young Olivia Bond, for that matter. Magalhaes embodies a deranged adult punished by isolation and loneliness, but without Bond’s early acts of innocence, Magalhaes would have no comparison point. It’s much easier for an adult Francisca to carry on this ever-evolving deterioration of morality because Bond’s cutesy, American-girl establishing material gets the process started early-on. There’s a brooding tonal growth that Pesce is able to establish, as he unravels a film that becomes more horrific with each passing second. At the start, we’re introduced to a lovely little Midwestern-like family who owns cows, and talk about medical procedures (Francisca’s mother was an eye surgeon in Portugal) – but by the film’s end, we’re living out a hellish, familial clusterf*ck. Humans transform into monsters (by representation), dead bodies make their way into daily life and innocent blood is drained with calculated precision. Pesce never halts a twisted evolution that spins more and more out of control with each passing scene, while keeping an engaging pace that never jars or stumbles over road bumps. Only necessary evils are captured on camera – a hard-fast rule more filmmakers should stand by. When you gaze into The Eyes Of My Mother, think about all the lives that could have been so different with fair growth circumstances. This is not a film about a vicious countryside slasher, but instead a poor woman’s unstable livelihood thanks to the most mangled upbringing any child could face. Wasted life, repercussions to someone else’s deviant actions, an empty existence filled with pain – these are the ingredients of real fear. True, everyday terror. In the realm of horror, nothing sinks deeper than human tales that closely stay true-to-life, so don’t you dare try and tell me a prime example of such dark delusions like The Eyes Of My Mother doesn’t qualify as genre material. I can already see another The Witch debate beginning, which should stop before it starts."
"May 3, 2016",POSITIVE,"The overwhelming feeling, throughout Nicolas Pesce's gripping horror drama, is of unsteadiness and dread - you may not know exactly what's happening, but you do know it's nothing good."
"Apr 8, 2016",POSITIVE,"If you stick with it and navigate its deliberate pace, you'll be profoundly affected and moved."
"Feb 19, 2016",NEGATIVE," Here is where I go off-book for my final Sundance review. The film is Nicolas Pesce‘s frightening The Eyes of My Mother, and I am not its target audience. This was not a pleasant experience for me. In fact, it took a lot to stay in the theater for the full 77-minute running time. The plot concerns young Francisca (Olivia Bond), who watches her mother murdered at the hands of a psychopath and then becomes complicit with her father (Paul Nazak) in enacting a painful, tortuous amount of vengeance on the man responsible. Francisca, years later (Kika Magalhaes), has lost her father but still has the man, chained in the barn, and literally eating from the palm of her hand. Solitude serves as the fuel for Francisca’s own fractured psychosis, the film revealing itself to be an extended nightmare filmed in beautiful, disconcerting black-and-white by Zach Kuperstein. Magalhaes haunts as the driving force of madness here, a kind of rapturous tornado of terror. There’s not much dialogue, and not much need for it. This film comes from Borderline Films, a production company that’s mastered the art of tortured souls in past Sundance fare like Martha Marcy May Marlene, Simon Killer and James White. The Eyes of My Mother is the bleakest of their films by some distance, and certainly the most unpleasant. In many ways, it plays less as a narrative feature and more like a terrifying thought you do your best to shake out of your head as quickly as possible. While this is clearly Pesce’s intention and the cosmetics are top-notch, the film never works as much more than a cinematic experiment solely focused on only the absolute worst inclinations of human nature. Many will respond to this positively, and it’s easy to see why. This film is so unabashedly, so unflinchingly evil that it is extremely impressive and extreme unlikeable. On a personal level, I hated this picture with every fiber of my being. Rarely do I slip into the first-person for these reviews, but for this I make an exception. Hopefully, I will forget the memory of seeing this movie and feeling the way I felt while watching it. In a way, this is a testament to its power and, in another way, a recommendation for those looking for a wholly uncomfortable theater-going experience. Ignore the letter grade at the bottom of this review and heed the words above. Pesce gave us a bad dream. I wanted to wake up the entire time.

"Feb 4, 2016",POSITIVE," Serial murder has rarely seemed a more melancholy calling than it does in “The Eyes of My Mother,” a short, decidedly unsweet and wholly startling vision from freshman writer-director Nicolas Pesce. Meshing an especially bloody strain of slasher pic with the most whispery of high-art sensibilities, this tale of a young Portuguese-American woman drawn — by way of misused heritage and scarring personal tragedy — into severely psychotic behavior reps an exquisite waking nightmare, its meticulous monochrome imagery caressing the eye even as the filmmaker brandishes a scalpel before it. A characteristically cold cut from the ever-exciting Borderline Films, this standout from Sundance’s Next program may, with its stretches of silent storytelling and fado-laced soundtrack, be a tad too lyrical for hard-horror fans, but a devoted cult audience awaits an adventurous distributor. “Never go in the barn,” a woman solemnly warns her child midway through the film. It’s a line seemingly plucked from a fairy tale, and for all its very adult interlacing of sadism and sensuality, “The Eyes of My Mother” does maintain a child’s-eye view of threat as its protagonist comes of age. Pesce’s heartland Gothic visuals — specifically the very inky expanses of Zach Kuperstein’s glorious widescreen lensing — conjure spooked memories of Charles Laughton’s “The Night of the Hunter.” In early scenes, meanwhile, as protagonist Francisca is introduced in the girlhood form of striking newcomer Olivia Bond, it’s not just the young actress’s dark, concentrated gaze that recalls Ana Torrent in “The Spirit of the Beehive”; both films probe children’s repulsed fascination with the monstrous, though “Eyes” literalizes the terror in the barn rather more emphatically than Victor Erice’s 1973 classic. Pesce plays a currently vogueish structural trick at the outset of the film, opening with an isolated fragment from a far later point in the action — though the flash-forward works effectively to further muddy the narrative’s hazy blurring of time and identity. Though the pic is neatly divided into three chapters — cryptically titled “Mother,” “Father” and “Family” — following its out-of-sync prologue, disorienting chronological leaps occur not just between but within them, with viewers left to assemble just what has come to pass in the unseen periods. Pesce’s spare script doesn’t seek to obscure, but its quiet, matter-of-fact handling of drastic dramatic events will catch some off-guard. Francisca is introduced as a wide-eyed naif, in thrall to her Portuguese mother (Diana Agostini) as she is taught the legend of Francis of Assissi — absorbing a message of gentle kindness to all creatures that is rather rudely contravened when Mom subsequently, and with notable sangfroid, shows her daughter how to dissect a cow’s eye on the kitchen table. (Ommetaphobes should be warned, if the title doesn’t tip them off, that they’re in for one of the squirmiest sits in a movie theater since Bunuel’s “Un chien andalou.”) We learn, in what turns out to be a salient detail, that Francisca’s mother was a surgeon in her homeland before taking up the life of a Midwestern farm wife. This already eerily tainted impression of bucolic childhood takes a significant turn for the worse when a wild-eyed stranger (Will Brill) turns up at the farmhouse and unceremoniously performs a vicious act of violence before the impressionable girl. The film’s ensuing escalation of torture and trauma — seemingly stemming from this incident, though perhaps embedded more deeply in the protagonist’s personal history — shouldn’t be divulged in too much detail. It’s fair to say, however, that Francisca grows into a young woman (Portuguese thesp Kika Magalhaes, passively transfixing throughout) with an ingenue’s curiosity regarding the body and pansexual desire, and a brute streak that belies her outward innocence. Pesce ventures into upsetting extremes of human violation and suffering, though there’s enough complex psychological grounding even to the pic’s grisliest setpieces to fend off accusations of exploitation or torture porn. As played with supple, mournful grace by Magalhaes (a former dancer, imbuing the role with a kind of swaying, uncanny physicality), Francisca remains perversely sympathetic even through her most severely inscrutable of actions. In a film that frequently places teasing emphasis on what lies just outside our sphere of knowledge or field of vision, Pesce and his superb d.p. are sure to make every image we do see count. There are individual frames here, whether of corpses milkily enveloped in a bathtub or blood-smeared fingerprints on a refrigerator door, that hover on the precipice of dreamscape, and may linger in that realm for some viewers long after watching. More than an artsy aesthetic gambit, the deep black-and-white contrasts of Kuperstein’s cinematography serve to suspend Pesce’s narrative in a reality that never seems completely defined. Working toward the same goal are Sam Hensen’s rustic, cleverly era-fudging production design and a soundtrack built on radical sonic reversals: The buzzing synths and rattling winds of Ariel Loh’s alien-electro score segue most disarmingly into a selection of lush Portuguese fado ballads, steering viewers in and out of our anti-heroine’s warped perspective on the horror before her."
"Jan 29, 2016",POSITIVE," The Eyes of My Mother was getting a lot of buzz at Sundance and folks saying it was disturbing and scary. So I checked it out and it really lives up to the buzz. Writer/director Nicolas Pesce has crafted one hell of a debut film.  As a child, Francisca (Olivia Bond) watches a stranger named Charlie (Will Brill) murder her mother (Diana Agostini). Francisca’s father (Paul Nazak) walks in on it, too late to save his wife but just in time to beat Charlie and lock him up in their barn. The lonely Francisca befriends Charlie and becomes obsessed with feeling the thrill he describes from killing as an adult (Kika Magalhaes).  It is disturbing to watch grown-up Francisca prey on vulnerable women, and especially disturbing when there is a baby involved. Equally disturbing is seeing young Francisca relate to the instrument of her trauma. Perhaps her father was too traumatized himself to stop her from doing that, but I suppose he knew what he was doing keeping Charlie alive in his barn. Charlie is a disturbing character. You can tell from his introduction that he’s bad news and you wish they hadn’t let him in the house, but he probably would have found a way in anyway. When he is reduced to a prisoner, he’s disgusting, with Pesce amping up the eating noises so he sounds like a suckling animal. Charlie is not Francisca’s only prisoner, and she plays on body parts we are all sensitive to: fingernails, eyes, mouths.  The performances are breakthrough. I really hope Bond is well-adjusted after performing the detached morbid interest she achieved. I’m more confident that Magalhaes can leave the work on the set, but she’s pretty convincing disarming her victims. Brill nails that sense that you know something’s wrong but makes you doubt yourself out of guilt. The actresses playing victims (Flora Diaz and Clara Wong) are able to achieve sympathy with little screen time, something that films with even larger ensembles often fail to do.  The Eyes of My Mother maintains a mood and atmosphere of dread. Shot in black and white, the shadows hang over the remote farm house. There are a few time jumps that also contribute to a jarring sense of displacement. The film runs a lean 77 minutes but there is enough material for months of nightmares.

"Jan 29, 2016",NEGATIVE," Unexpected tales of macabre violence and intrigue in a rural American setting are nothing new. The innocent-looking house or barn harbouring horror and gore is as much a part of US film-making as the romcom. But it’s possible the trope has never seemed as weird as this. Director Nicolas Pesce’s tale about a country-dwelling family strikes an uncomfortable note from the first scene. A stranger (Will Brill) approaches the idyllic home of an American-Portuguese family, and once he’s managed to worm his way into the house he kills the family’s matriarch in the bath tub. From there things develop into something that sits between Almodóvar’s The Skin I Live In and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as the father returns to seek vengeance, finally deciding to chain the attacker up in their barn. Scenes have next to no dialogue as the family of two, played by Paul Nazak and Kika Magalhaes, share short exchanges, with Annie (Magalhaes) tending to their hostage. From its black-and-white presentation to its minimalist construction the film cries out arthouse, but there’s a sense it’s trying way too hard. Scenes that should be shocking end up being strangely comical, like when Annie – now fully grown – picks up a woman at a bar (Clara Wong) and tells her matter-of-factly that she killed her father and enjoys dissecting cows’ eyes, before murdering her and putting the body parts in the fridge. When the man who murdered her mother tries to escape, she captures him and kills him softly, hugging, kissing and stabbing him all at the same time, the incisions accompanied by squelching that makes the whole thing hard to take seriously. Annie’s antics escalate and once she’s got no one else to talk to (because she’s killed everyone) she tries to find new victims. From the first moment she is picked up by a woman with a baby, it’s obvious where things are going. Annie has another captive and now a child to raise as her own and presumably teach the pleasures of kidnapping and torture. What’s never really presented is the motivation. Why is Annie running around stabbing everything in sight? How did her victim survive in a barn wearing nothing but a loincloth for several years? Pesce asks viewers to go along with the absurdity while offering nothing to justify any of it. It’s a murder ballad gone out of tune."

The opening 10 minutes of writer-director Nicolas Pesce’s “The Eyes of My Mother” plays like the art-film version of an old EC Comics horror story — like one of those “Vault of Horror” or “Tales from the Crypt” eight-pagers where a monster gets its comeuppance at the claws of an even bigger monster. In a remote American farmhouse in the mid-20th century, a Portuguese surgeon-turned-housewife makes the mistake of allowing a creepy drifter named Charlie ( Will Brill) into her home, where he commits an act of unspeakable violence. But then her taciturn farmer husband arrives on the scene, and Charlie discovers that there some people are capable of conceiving of even more depraved things to do to human beings than he can. Pesce shoots this little vignette in stark black and white, with static, clinical framing, and minimal sound beyond the moans and thrashing of the victims. It’s a brutal, horrifying way to start a movie. And it’s only the beginning. It’s hard to explain exactly what “The Eyes of My Mother” is. Pesce is a next-generation addition to the collective at Borderline Films, whose Sean Durkin, Antonio Campos, and Josh Mond are responsible for some of the most exciting American art films of the past decade — visionary hybrids of character sketch and genre exercise like “Martha Marcy May Marlene,” “Afterschool,” “Simon Killer,” and “James White.” “The Eyes of My Mother” has a lot in common with those movies, in that Pesce takes full advantage of every tool available to him, from sound to lighting to acting, to create something that’s artfully textured, visually gorgeous, and thoroughly gripping. And his film is also, ultimately, an exploration of one person’s fractured psyche. The person in question is Francisca, played as a little girl by Olivia Bond and as a young woman by Kika Magalhaes. Francisca mutely witnesses what happens to her mother, and then is an active participant in what happens to Charlie, on whom she practices some of the surgical techniques she picked up from her mom. Then she grows up and watches her dad get older and more decrepit, leaving her alone and unprepared to live in society. As played by Magalhaes, Francisca is practically an alien creature who moves with a halting, inhuman precision, and has no idea how to talk to other people. As her loneliness intensifies, she decides to make an effort to find some friends who might want to join her on her farm. But as Charlie can attest, Francisca has some curious ideas about what “companionship” means. So if the first 10 minutes of “The Eyes of My Mother” is like a single EC Comics story, the remaining 67 are like an extended epilogue, showing what comes next for the monsters who devour other monsters. Or maybe an even better comparison would be classic “wrong turn” horror films like “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” or “The People Under the Stairs,” where ordinary folks who make the mistake of knocking on the worst possible doors. “The Eyes of My Mother” is kind of like an origin story for the psychopaths those unlucky fools stumble on. The big question though is whether there’s a point to all this. Squeamish and skittish moviegoers can often tolerate a lot of shock and gore if there’s some emotional or thematic payoff. And unlike recent horror sensations like “The Babadook,” “It Follows,” or “The Witch,” it’s hard to argue that “The Eyes of My Mother” has much to say. To some extent it’s a portrait of extreme alienation, following the deeply Catholic, sloppily parented Francisca as she converts her limited understanding of the world into unintentional evil. But really this film is about Pesce following a kind of nightmare logic for an hour and fifteen minutes, imagining one terrible scenario and then trying to think of what might happen next that could be even worse.
