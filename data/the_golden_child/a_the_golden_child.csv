"Mar 1, 2024",NEUTRAL,"A comedy adventure film the likes of which are no longer being made. Although silly in places, it is fascinating, action packed and uplifting. One of the best of his type."
"Dec 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"One of those childhood staples that you aren't embarrassed about as an adult.  Decent jokes, creative, fun characters, crafty cinematography, etc."
"Aug 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,Entertaining enough but nothing special in comedy or action.
"Jan 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,The Golden Child is an okay film. It is about a private detective who is charged with the task of finding a special child whom dark forces want to eliminate. Eddie Murphy and Charlotte Lewis give decent performances. The script is a little slow in places. Michael Ritchie did an alright job directing this movie. I liked this motion picture because of the action and humor.
"Jan 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Dec 25, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I'm not sure how this movie can be so poorly reviewed on here. The sheer volume of quotables from this movie is worth at least a 6/10.
All that aside, typical 80s movie with an above average story. If you're expecting Lawrence of Arabia going into it you'll be disappointed. If you enjoy a good scifi/fantasy/comedy then you'll definitely enjoy this.
Brother Numsie, please forgive me!"
"Dec 10, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I liked this film, Eddie Murphy was very funny in it and Charles dance was quite sinister in it."
"Oct 25, 2022",NEUTRAL,One of my favorite movies! I saw it in the theater when it first came out. I've watched it many times. I have no clue why anyone would rate it less that 4-stars! I purchased the DVD too!
"Sep 9, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I dig the classic 80s comedy movie punch this one has.  I watched it many times as a kid, so I decided to revisit it today.  Eddie Murphy is in his peak comedic form as ""the chosen one"" destined to save the Golden Child from the clutches of evil.  There are many funny moments.  Special effects for the day are not bad, and the soundtrack represents the 80s era quite nicely.  It's kinda cool how there are many familiar 80s character actors in this.  I liked it.  It's ""possible"" I might revisit this again one day.  I long to be a kid again."
"Mar 7, 2022",NEUTRAL,"descent flick.  Typical 80's movie.  Special effects where bad, but so was Ghostbusters"
"Feb 13, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Loved this film as a kid, the professional critics need to lighten up! It's supposed to be a bit daft, Eddie Murphy is hilarious, lighthearted and funny if you've not sat on a stick"
"Nov 24, 2021",NEUTRAL,"Com o passar dos anos esse filme foi perdendo seu encanto, porém não deixa de ter seus momentos."
"Nov 24, 2021",NEUTRAL,Back in 1986 that year it was good. Now not so much as then.
"Sep 11, 2021",NEUTRAL,Eddie Murphy is great with his comedy as his character cracks jokes while in dangerous situations.  Classic.
"Aug 23, 2021",NEUTRAL,"""It's a good thing Buddhism teaches freedom from desire, 'cause I've got the desire to kick your ass!"""
"Jun 26, 2021",NEUTRAL,"An unfunny, forgettable, lame film with a story that had nothing going for it."
"Apr 28, 2021",NEUTRAL,"This is one of those movies that I feel was pretty good for it's time, but didn't age very well. Eddie Murphy does a great job, but the script is a little bit weak and predictable by todays (2021) standards."
"Apr 17, 2021",NEUTRAL,"The Golden Child suffers from a predictable plot, jarringly bad special effects for ILM (contrast the villain's final form with a decently animated stop-motion Pepsi can earlier in the movie) and an underwhelming third act. What prevents it from being one of Eddie Murphy's weaker movies are his own presence, genuinely well-executed comedic scenes, a comically serious Charles Dance, a well-composed score, decent soundtrack choices, world-building that I wish we got to see more of and amusingly cheesy fight scenes. It's probably for the best we got this movie instead of the more serious Mel Gibson fantasy-action flick that this was originally going to start out as but, as Eddie Murphy's first non-R-rated feature, it could've been so much better."
"Mar 9, 2021",NEUTRAL,Underrated! These kind of movies are hard to find.
"Feb 3, 2021",NEUTRAL,"Funny action/fantasy film all the way through. It was not the best made film, but Eddie Murphy's comedy along with Charles Dance excellent performance as the villain makes this movie well worth the time."
"Jan 15, 2021",NEUTRAL,"An unfortunate omen for Eddie Murphy's critically downward turn of his later career just because he'd ignited stardom from his previous comedic picture ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and advantageously carried on for a gambled hopeful replicated success into the next follow-up film which turned out utterly ridiculous and inadvertently paved a narrative tone Adam Sandler questionably pursues. (C)"
"Jan 3, 2021",NEUTRAL,"Yeah... no matter how many times I give this a try, that a big nope from me. This may be Murphy's weakest movie, and that's saying something considering the output of the past 2 decades... I don't know, maybe it's a fun adventure movie for kids, but I just groan and am bored to tears."
"Dec 26, 2020",NEUTRAL,"I was particularly intrigued to spot and Australian Eastern Rosella starring as the resurrected magical parrot guide - although I'm not sure what bird they dubbed it with.

I'd say this kind of has the story-vibes of Monkey Magic, but done in a slightly more toned down way?  The titular Golden Child is a magic planet healer who is stolen by the nefarious baddy (who I kept calling Snape for vibey reasons).  The baddy plans to wear down the child's powers and kill them.  I think they refer to the child as a boy, but it's played by a girl in her one-off acting appearance ever.  Anyway, Eddie Murphy plays a child finder and he's enlisted by to help find the child in LA.  There are some great long eighties LA montages to really set the scene here.  There's also a super heavy eighties soundtrack to really timestamp the whole thing."
"Dec 15, 2020",NEUTRAL,One of my absolute favorite movies if all times!!
"Dec 12, 2020",NEUTRAL,"The eighties were Eddie Murphy's domain and rightfully so. I hadn't watched this movie in at least ten years, and while the effects and music haven't aged well, it certainly transports you back in time. Even the cringeworthy dialogue is fun to revisit. 
Here Murphy plays a specialist in finding missing children and is tasked with finding the kidnapped Golden Child, unaware of the supernatural forces that surrounds this case. 
Fun rewatch."
"Nov 14, 2020",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, kung fu, street smart good guy and occult bad guys. And as cherry on top, Charles Dance as the bad guy!!!"
"Nov 3, 2020",NEUTRAL,"It's not that bad. Sure it's a little dated, but it's still watchable. The film was never meant to be taken too seriously, and for it's worth; it's an ok film. Still worth watching."
"Sep 13, 2020",NEUTRAL,Good for nostalgia and a few laughs.
"Aug 24, 2020",NEUTRAL,One of my favourite movies when I was a child
"Apr 10, 2020",NEUTRAL,loved it then and love it now
"Mar 10, 2020",NEUTRAL,This film is horrible and a complete waste of film.
"Nov 17, 2019",NEUTRAL,"O Rapto do Menino Dourado (1986) 3,0 ⭐️ #MovieReview Investigador particular é solicitado para caso de rapto de criança no Tibet, considerada especial. Bom ritmo, piadas na medida certa e efeitos especiais hoje estranhos mas na época ok. Boa diversão!"
"Aug 14, 2019",NEUTRAL,"It's better than 'The Hangover Part 2'
I've just watched them both
and it's better
I never want to see it again"
"Jun 22, 2019",NEUTRAL,"One of my favorites as a kid. This movie gets a lot of hate, but it's mythology is incredible; with Eddie Murphy in his prime
And Charles Dance as one of the more interesting Demons on film... you cant beat it!"
"Jun 21, 2019",NEUTRAL,One of eddie murphy's instant classics out side of his normal setting.
"Mar 29, 2019",NEUTRAL,Critics are morons. They just don't get the humour.
"Jan 27, 2019",NEUTRAL,if you were not alive during its release to appreciate it it's hard to appreciate with the new technology but in this movies time it was definitely the shit.
"Apr 14, 2018",NEUTRAL,One of the worst music scores of all time. The music was completely opposed to the film in almost every aspect. 3.5/10
"Feb 2, 2018",NEUTRAL,A very entertaining and silly movie thanks in large part to Eddie Murphy. Its very harmless and never takes itself too seriously.
"Nov 9, 2017",NEUTRAL,This film - insignificant and lightweight and monumentally silly - is entertaining from beginning to end. Eddie is great! Read Roger Ebert's review.
"Mar 17, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Story/Screenplay: (3.5/5) As a comedy it works, but just barely.  I suspect some lines that weren't good had been ad libbed by Murphy.

Duration/Tempo: (4/5) At 1 hour and 34 minutes, it's a short movie that feels short.

Cast & Crew: (4/5) Overall, Eddie Murphy was a plus, but he was funny and then unfunny throughout.  Charles Dance and Charlotte Lewis were excellent.

Summary: (4/5) It's a comedy that's easy to watch.  Murphy could be taxing at times, but the end result is a thumbs up."
"Jan 6, 2017",NEUTRAL,Pretty good funny Eddie Murphy cult movie.
"Jan 6, 2017",NEUTRAL,this is one of my favorite Eddie murphy films me and my friend offten quote the film
"Dec 22, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Is it imperfect ?  Yes.
Were parts of it re-shot on orders from the Studio to make it more like Cop I ?  Yes.
Was it re-scored with an entire John Barry score being dumped during re-shoots and extensive re-editing ?  Yes.  
Was it late for its original release window because of this ?  Yes, it was scheduled for a Christmas '85 release. 
Is it still a good movie regardless of all of that ?  Hell Yes !"
"Nov 12, 2016",NEUTRAL,Awesome childhood film from the 80's
"Nov 2, 2016",NEUTRAL,Typical Rotten Tomato critic review full of arrogant critics who believe that everyone really cares what they think. You know what they say about the crack of the behind and its relativity to opinions!
"Oct 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Eddie Murphy is doing all the work but he can't carry the film by himself. I loved the comedy, but I still hated the movie."
"Aug 30, 2016",NEUTRAL,Eddie Murphy was great to watch in this fantasy/comedy/thriller.
"Apr 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I wanted to like this film, I really did. But the few good scene in this (the ones where Chinese Mythology is actually played with) are outweighed by the rest of the movie, which is slow and uninteresting. The characters are pretty bland for the most part, and it's a shame. I saw a lot of potential in this movie, but Michael Ritchie and Paramount didn't even come close to utilizing that potential to the fullest. This movie is only partly charged, and is glitchy when the charge wears off."
"Mar 18, 2016",NEUTRAL,It's kind of like Beverly Hills Cop 1.5 but it's a part of the classic Eddie Murphy Era when he was still hilarious. The special effects obviously seem dated now but let's be honest that's not why you watch this gem.
"Jan 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,Very weird and funny movie. The throwback to the 80s is pretty awesome to see now.
"Dec 16, 2015",NEUTRAL,"The Golden Child is a strange mix between Beverly Hills Cop and Big Trouble in Little Tokyo. It fixed everything I hated about Beverly Hills Cop, but really had the potential to be one of the best 80s action comedies if it made its characters larger than life.
A LA cop who specializes in child disappearances is requested to save the recently kidnapped ""golden child"" in Tibet, who has been granted powers to save the world from the man who kidnapped him, a demon in disguise.
The Golden Child was actually really enjoyable. It was even pretty good, but not great and very easily forgettable. It blends Beverly Hills Cop with some slightly corny danger filled action sequences, testing Murphy more as a hero like protagonist. The story is decent, too, but here's where Golden Child could accel. The characters have the potential to be strong and a lot more compelling than they have been written. the character of the Golden Child himself is already compelling but could have much more to it, his powers are almost God-like and the writers had opportunities to test that in areas. The antagonist Sardo Numpsa is hardly chilling but has a mystical count-like feel to it. The essence that the character is a demon and could rival the Golden Child's powers is also not tested enough. The Golden Child could have so many uses for its characters but instead focuses on Murphy - which Eddie is classic Eddie, not much to say about him. The Golden Child fixed everything I already stated that I hate about the Beverly Hills Cop series, from a faster pace to humor that actually works and isn't just awkward. The Golden Child is good and entertaining, but it had the potential to be a lot more than just an Eddie Murphy box office dough guarantee."
"Dec 7, 2015",NEUTRAL,"The Golden Child is not ""Golden"" at all...more like silver plated.  It does have some good parts with Eddie Murphy providing a few laughs but it's nothing special 2.5/5 or 5/10."
"Oct 14, 2015",NEUTRAL,"In a temple in an unknown location in northeastern Nepal, a young boy with mystical abilities - the Golden Child - receives badges of station and demonstrates his power to the monks of the temple by reviving a dead eastern rosella, which becomes a constant companion. However, a band of villains led by a mysterious man, Sardo Numspa (Charles Dance), breaks into the hidden temple, slaughters the monks and abducts the boy. Some time afterwards, a young woman named Kee Nang (Charlotte Lewis) watches a Los Angeles TV show in which social worker Chandler Jarrell (Eddie Murphy) talks about his latest case, a missing girl named Cheryll Mosley. She seeks him out the next day and informs him of the kidnapping of the Golden Child and that he is the 'Chosen One' who would save the Child. Chandler does not take this seriously, even after the astral form of the Child and his bird familiar begin following him.
Soon Cheryll Mosley is found, dead from blood loss, near an abandoned house smeared with Tibetan graffiti and a pot full of blood-soaked oatmeal. Kee Nang reveals to him that this house was a holding place for the Child and introduces Chandler to Doctor Hong, a mystic expert, and Kala (a creature half dragon, half woman, who remains hidden behind a screen). The three track down a motorcycle gang, the Yellow Dragons, which Cheryll had joined, and Chinese restaurant owner Tommy Tong, a henchman of Numspa, to whom Cheryll had been 'sold' for her blood, used to make the Child vulnerable to earthly harm. Tong, however, is killed by Numspa as a potential traitor. Still not taking the case too seriously, Chandler is drawn by Numspa-whom Chandler begins to continuously call ""Numsy""-into a controlled dream, where he receives a burn mark on his arm. Numspa also presents his demands: the Ajanti Dagger (a mystic weapon which is capable of killing the Golden Child) in exchange for the boy. Chandler finally agrees to help, and he and Kee Nang travel to Tibet to retrieve the Ajanti Dagger...

""The Golden Child"" was originally intended as a serious adventure drama with Mel Gibson in the lead role. After Gibson turned the film down and Eddie Murphy replaced him, the script was rewritten as a partial comedy. Released in December 1986, The Golden Child was a box office success. It earned USD$79,817,937 in the U.S. alone, making it the eighth biggest film of the year. However, the film was considered a disappointment by the studio when compared to Murphy's previous film, Beverly Hills Cop, which garnered USD$234,760,478 at the US box office. Been ages since I saw ""The Golden Child"" and I was keen to resee it. Eddie Murphy was hot in the mid 80s after three massive hits at the box office, ""48 Hrs"", ""Trading Places"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop"". But, one can wonder why he chose to do this one as the set up and script doesn´t really fit him in my eyes. Maybe the problem was the rewrite from a serious adventure drama to an action adventure comedy. It´s amongst his worst movies to be honest, both plot (it doesn´t really know what it wants to be) and production wise. Eddie Murphy is not at his best. I do like the lovely Charlotte Lewis, but she is handled in a weird way. And Charles Dance is never bad, even if he does look a bit lost here. The effects are hardly up to scratch when seeing it today, but most likely it was ok in 1986. It's pretty poor from a directorial perspective as well. No one seems to really have had the heart in the production. ""The Golden Child"" can be passed and it won´t be missed."
"Aug 8, 2015",NEUTRAL,This falls under the Gymkata genre.
"May 16, 2015",NEUTRAL,It's not the finest work of Eddie Murphy and the CGI is dreadful.
"Apr 12, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Big Trouble in Little China lite (which makes sense as John Carpenter was originally going to be the director). Not good enough to be good, not bad enough to be good-bad."
"Mar 22, 2015",NEUTRAL,A testament to Murphy's star power that this crap ruled the box office.
"Feb 16, 2015",NEUTRAL,"Vintage Eddie Murphy, yeah, it looks dated, but I loved this as a kid and it is still fun to watch, and the dancing Pepsi can still looks great to this day. The premise is interesting, with some fun action and Eddie Murphy giving some of his most memorable lines, I could not tell you how many times I have quoted it with the line, ""Can I please have the knife!"" The special effect are fine, although the end fight with the demon was a little too choppy with its use of stop motion animation, but other then that The Golden Child is still a good time, although it does have the normal amount of 80's language, so keep that in mind if showing this to your kids.
3 Beards Out Of 5"
"Feb 4, 2015",NEUTRAL,"A solid outing from Eddie Murphy the height of his career. Not nearly  as funny as Coming to America or action packed as Beverly Hills Cop, but it is an entertaining movie that provides a nice escape. If your a fan of Eddie Murphy, you'll enjoy this, but if your new to him, i wouldn't recommend starting with it."
"Dec 28, 2014",NEUTRAL,"3 Stars for the sheer fact something like this exists. An odd collection of b-movie ideas collected into one less than stellar film starring Eddie Murphy playing it straight. With a lesser Big Trouble in Little China vibe, one wonders if the making of this film is where the real story is found."
"Dec 17, 2014",NEUTRAL,"What's amazing to me is that AFTER he did Trading Places, 48 Hours and Beverly Hills Cop ... this B-movie comes along and he agrees to do it. He must have been paid a LOT of money."
"Aug 18, 2014",NEUTRAL,Didn't mind this when I was younger
"Aug 7, 2014",NEUTRAL,The only film I want remade. Without Murphy and better SFX and loads of kung fu.
"May 25, 2014",NEUTRAL,"downright awful, neither funny nor exciting"
"May 4, 2014",NEUTRAL,Literally one of the funniest films that I have ever seen. And definitely my favorite Eddie Murphy flick of all-time... 💯❤👍🏾
"Apr 27, 2014",NEUTRAL,Eddie Murphy being funny in a fantasy story. That's enough really isn't it?
"Apr 20, 2014",NEUTRAL,"I loved it, can't figure why the bad ratings"
"Mar 9, 2014",NEUTRAL,Can't beleive this is a pg used to scare the me so much (the porridge scene) spoilers
"Jan 19, 2014",NEUTRAL,"The Golden Child may be far from the success of Beverly Hills Cop, but it still serves up a blend of action, fantasy, and plenty of Eddie Murphy's laughs."
"Dec 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"(46%)
An awkwardly plotted Eddie Murphy flick that moderately entertains as it goes along. The main problem here though is that it is too silly to be taken seriously and not funny enough to be counted as a proper good comedy. It does have a slight ""Big trouble in little China"" feel to it which is nice and Eddie did make much worse, but this is no classic."
"Dec 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,This movie is so hilarious
"Dec 9, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Cheesy but entertaining 80's fantasy comedy with Eddie Murphy, it's a mix of Beverly Hills Cop and Big Trouble in Little China."
"Dec 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Eddie still in his prime doing what all Eddie Murphy movies do, get out of his way. Adding an original somewhat out there plot line too the mix and you get a very enjoyable 80's action comedy."
"Sep 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,Always enjoyed this silly comedy since I was a kid.
"Aug 25, 2013",NEUTRAL,"So many good bad movies came out of the 80's and The Golden Child is a... golden example. This was also during the time that Eddie Murphy was at the top of his game. TGC can't be taken too seriously nor should a lot of movies Murphy did at the time. It's just plain fun, or a guilty pleasure if you will. There is just enough story to keep you interested and Murphy serves up his signature comedy and wit throughout. If your a fan of his work in the 80's or movies like Big Trouble in Little China check out The Golden Child, you will not be disappointed."
"Jul 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Probably the start of Eddie Murphy's fall from grace where his loud-mouthed schtick became beyond tiresome with an unengaging story with little to draw the viewer in. Bad 80s sound mixing pumps loud music immediately after quieter dialogue, coupled with Murphy's tendency to shout most of his lines makes this film an irritating chore to watch."
"Jun 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,Better stick with Beverly Hills Cop.
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,My Favorite Fantasy Film Is 1933's King Kong.
"May 27, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A interesting combination of comedy and adventure,it works very well."
"May 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Still pretty good, haven't seen it since I was a kid but still had that fun corny vibe to it. Murphy was pretty good as he always was back in the 80s some of it really holds up."
"May 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Eddie Murphy is off on a wild and magical adventure in The Golden Child.  The story follows an investigator who's recruited to find the Golden Child, a little boy with magical abilities who's been kidnapped by an agent of evil that plans to kill him.  The plot's rather weak and is poorly told.  And, the special effects are awful (even for the '80s).  Additionally, Murphy doesn't seem right for the role; as he puts too much comedy into his performance.  Still, The Golden Child is a fun adventure at times and delivers some laughs."
"May 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,entertaining film not to be taken seriously
"Apr 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,2 Brother Noomsies out of 5
"Mar 31, 2013",NEUTRAL,its a classic and i still love the soda can dancing
"Mar 22, 2013",NEUTRAL,"this movie is crap as a action movie, but as a comedy it's culty goodness."
"Mar 10, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I love this movie, who can forget ""I I I w w w ant the knife!"""
"Feb 26, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It's a mess. Basically, there are several nice, funny scenes with Eddy Murphy and some of the minor characters, but the rest of the story is abrupt. Murphy doesn't believe in mysticism, but goes along with it. Why? He's not a police officer, but he has jurisdiction? The Golden Child will save them all how? What? He can resurrect people...sometimes. I like the actor who plays the demon, and how hilariously confused he is by Eddy Murphy. The soundtrack is cheap, the action is dull, the story is whatever."
"Feb 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Marty got this for Christmas and made me watch it, it was funny."
"Feb 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,Love this movie... Eddie Murphy at his best
"Feb 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,Absolutely brilliant movie! One of the best I've ever seen in my entire life!
"Jan 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,Still a favorite.  My dear sweet brother Numpsy has forgiven me!
"Jan 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I vaguely remember enjoying this as a kid, on a recent viewing however, it has made me realise that Eddie Murphy only made about 3 or 4 good films during his career, this isn't one of them. 
Ineptly plotted with terrible special effects (even for 80's standards). The whole thing is a mess. Comparisons can be made to John Carpenter's movie Big Trouble In Little China, which is much better (and funnier)"
"Dec 7, 2012",NEUTRAL,This is a classic from Eddie murphy.I want the kni- knife!Charles Dance is also excellent as the demonic villian. Charlotte Lewis i used to fancy like hell! An absolute blast with Murphey on a race against time to save the golden child. A fun classic in my eyes.
"Dec 1, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Kind of worked in the 80s, but not any more."
"Oct 31, 2012",NEUTRAL,A nice comedic performance by Murphy in an otherwise ridiculous and awful movie.
"Oct 27, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Classic Fantasy, Although It Looks Dated By Today's Standards, It's Still A Great Enjoyable Film. Michael Ritchie's Cult Film See's Eddie Murphy As Chandler Jarrell, A Social Worker Who Finds Missing Children. Jarrell Is The Chosen One As He Must Fight The Devil's Right Hand Demon, Sardo Numspa (Charles Dance), To Save The Golden Child, A Young Boy Who Has Come To Save Earth. This Fantasy Has Good Story, Which Is Executed Very Well. Murphy Is Great, Riding On The Back Of Beverly Hills Cop Here. This Film May Be Monumentally Silly & Dated But Is Entertaining From Beginning To End. A Family Film Which Works & Features The Great But Dated Monster Works, Ray Harryhausen Style."
"Oct 25, 2012",NEUTRAL,"I don't care what anyone says, this movie is still funny, interesting, and unique."
"Oct 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The Golden Child is silly, but far from a golden Eddie Murphy movie."
"Oct 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,Good fantasy film. The special effects were terrible but the script was decent. Eddie Murphy was Eddie.. Serious role could have been better for him.
"Sep 26, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Riding the line between so bad it's good and so bad it's terrible, The Golden Child is so bad it's... OK."
"Sep 25, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Ah, the 80's, how I love thee.

There's just something about that decade. Whether it be for better or for worse, the 80's just had such a distinct style and character, and its one that I grew up with, despite being a 90's kid, as I watched my parents and older sister's favorite films of the 80's and experienced their love for the decade second-hand. I was born in '88, but I wish I had been born a few years prior, so I could have actually had memories of those years first-hand.

And amongst those years, was Eddie Murphy. Now, I know that Murphy has been around since, with a slew of hit comedies in the 90's, and a few recent glimmers of hope at a career revival. But the 80's was the era of Eddie. It's where he reached his prime in classics like ""Beverly Hills Cop"", ""Coming to America"" and ""Trading Places.""

""The Golden Child"" is not one of Eddie's classics. It's arguably one of his worst films both plot and production wise, to be honest. It is, however, for all intents and purposes, a fun piece of fluff that literally oozes the 80's vibe, and has enough likability to actually function well as a brain-dead piece of dumb-fun.

Murphy stars as our lead, Chandler Jarrell, a wise-cracking guy who works as... well, he works. I really didn't get what his character was supposed to be. At first, it's implied he's a cop or a detective, but then other scenes seem to suggest he's a social worker (which I've seen mentioned as his profession on other websites)... Yet he also is allowed onto the scene of a murder where he combs through evidence. Perhaps he's a cop who interns at a social work center?

Anywho, Chandler is approached by a pretty young woman named Kee Nang, who informs him that he is the ""chosen one"", who must save the ""Golden Child""- a child with magical powers, whom was kidnapped from Nepal by the villainous Sardo Numspa (Charles Dance), a demonic figure with magical powers of his own.

Chandler, hesitant at first by Kee's bizarre claims, is eventually dragged into the fight to rescue the child when he realizes her claims are true. And so, a struggle to reclaim the magical boy and a mystical dagger begins from the clutches of Numspa begins.

Before I start in on what's wrong with the film, first let me address what is right about it, and why I gave this film a few courtesy points. Eddie Murphy and the cast are enjoyable, and save the film. Murphy, though annoying, does illicit a lot (and I do mean a LOT) of giggles and chuckles throughout the film. Charlotte Lewis, who portrays Kee, is pretty and completely likable as Chandler's guide and potential love interest. Dance is a bit of fun as the villain. And supporting characters portrayed by the likes of Victor Wong, James Hong and J.L. Reate (the eponymous Golden Child, who is actually played by a girl) are a lot of fun. The cast is likable.

Also, the effects in the film are fantastic for the 80's. A lot of stop-motion animation, miniatures and optical effects are utilized (and provided by Industrial Lights and Magic), and they are among the best of the decade. Particularly the stop motion in two sequences (the ""dancing Pepsi can"" and the big demon creatures who shows up), which are so well- done I completely forgot they were even effects, and thought they were somehow shot in-camera for real. Wonderful effects and animation work.

Now, let's get started on what doesn't work. First, the script, by Dennis Feldman. It barely functions within a storytelling capacity. I already mentioned above the the film is barely able to establish what Chandler's profession is, and it doesn't stop there. The first few scenes are actually well-written, including a cool opening that establishes the Golden Child before he is kidnapped in a cool little heist, and a great comedic scene introducing Chandler. But from there, it falls apart. Almost no attention is given to character development. Chandler is the same character throughout the film- he doesn't grow or become more responsible. Nobody in the film at all has any sort of character arc. And the script seems unable to focus in on the story at all. Scene after scene is jumbled, and nothing is established properly. It's a very poorly written film.

The direction by Michael Ritchie and the editing by Richard A. Harris (both established talents in film) are the other big problem. Ritchie, who is actually a decent filmmaker, seems lost with the material. Shots are very bland and boring, and a lot of them are poorly framed. It felt like his heart wasn't in it at all. And the editing is jarring, foul and creates an uneven pace that will practically give you whiplash. Not only that, but the jarring nature of the editing also creates a lot of continuity problems. It's a poorly crafted film from the directorial and editing perspective.

Also, there are a lot of weird little problems within the film. From wonky costume design, to bizarre inconsistencies within the logic of the filmmaking (including the treatment of Kee, who is alternatingly sexualized and made to look ""hot"" before suddenly being dressed uber- conservatively and un-sexualized, which happens repeatedly)... It felt like the crew was unaware and unsure of what type of film to make, and kept second-guessing themselves.

""The Golden Child"" is a bizarre little film. The performances and the imaginative effects make it worth checking out, but the storytelling and direction is offensively bad. I'd say give it a shot, you might like it, you might not. An average 5 out of 10 for the good which just slightly outweighs the bad."

Yes, there were annoyances (the lead female being one of them), but Eddie Murphy is as cool as always, and that's what really matters. And plenty of things here are pretty cool. Not to mention, as in Last Action Hero, Charles Dance shows up as the villain, a formula that I tend to like. The only flaw I get frequently annoyed with is that, for a movie whose setting involves Tibet and Nepal, the writers don't seem to have done much research on the subject of Tibetan culture, as many films set around Tibet are often guilty of."

It's '80s Eddie Murphy, back when he was still on fire, and it's a fun, mystical '80s action/fantasy that doesn't take itself too seriously. I just can't fight that combo.

"Mar 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,"This is actually a good movie, with all the Eddie Murphy hallmarks. Eddie Murphy delivers his lines quite effectively. I still remember some of the things he said. They don't make many movies like this anymore. Where many modern action films involve a copious amount of CGI, this film only uses it when necessary. They movie goes all out with great presentation, featuring great songs like ""Body Talk"" and ""Best Man in the World"". But the plot could have used more work, like delving further into who Sardo Numspa is working for. I also criticize how useless the Golden Child is until the end. If he really were the Golden Child, wouldn't he touch the cage around him to make it disappear, so he can escape? Other than that, it's really good."

"Mar 2, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The Golden Child is an 80s classic where Eddie Murphy is given free reign to be himself in the middle of a ""world's end"" cliche calamity, which provides perfect humour throughout. The special effects are terrible and and in doing so, they add immense value to this timeless classic. There are constant bumps to the ride for the hero of this story, and he pulls his stunts off with hilarious results. Who cares for ceremony? Who cares for seriousness of the situation? Anything can be defused with a bit of Murphy comedy, and this one just does it so well."

"Feb 4, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Ah, the 1980s heyday of PG-13 Orientalist adventure flicks. In the wake of Indiana Jones, these films seems to have had a brief but significant cultural impact (certainly true for those of us growing up in the 80s.) The main issue with this film is the direction. Eddie Murphy is excellent and hilarious but not used to the degree he should be. The effects range from outstanding to down-right silly and makes it hard for the film to have any sort of visual coherence. Never-the-less it continues to be a nostalgic treat though I would take ""Big Trouble in Little China"" over this one any day."
"Feb 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,"I have a love and hate relationship with this film.  I realize that it is not very good, but at the same time, I still tend to enjoy watching it occasionally.  This is nowhere near Eddie Murphy's best film, but also nowhere near his worst."
"Feb 2, 2012",NEUTRAL,Eddie's pretty good in this one. A street wise (personality to match) finder of lost children is chosen to save a gifted child from a demon. He was already following the demons path after all. 
"Jan 21, 2012",NEUTRAL,Seriously a strange plot with a stranger cast but somehow someone saw through this combination and brought it to the silverscreen and thank-you whoever you were.
"Jan 18, 2012",NEUTRAL,"In the 1980's, Eddie Murphy was the king of the world, what with huge box office hits and stand-up routines following a wildly successful stint on ""Saturday Night Live"". It would appear the star started feeling that he could do no wrong, which is the only thing that can explain ""The Golden Child"".
It was originally conceived as a more serious project starring Mel Gibson but was retooled as a comedy once Mel dropped out and was replaced by Eddie. I'm not sure how it would have worked as a serious film, but the comedy is strained. Murphy improvised a lot of it, and it's just not funny. In fact, he annoyingly laughs at his own jokes throughout most of this, as if he knows no one else will realize that this is supposed to be funny. 
Sadly, the only thing the film honestly succeeds at is being a campy cult film simply because it's so silly and misguided. The story is ridiculous, and the special effects are typically 80's cheezy stop-motion crap that would make Ray Harryhausen turn over in his grave. Murphy himself is still very naturally appealing, but this was his first step into his career slide where he seemed to get a little full of himself and started making more vanity projects. Co-star Charlotte Lewis is attractive enough, but she isn't much of an actress, and sadly enough this debut feature was the highlight of her career.
Michael Ritchie is a talented comedic director, but he seems to be unsure of how to handle this material. It's just all over the map, and like a car crash you just can't turn away, but that's not much praise. ""The Golden Child"" is a curiosity, really, a puzzling film that was inexplicably a hit upon its initial release that hasn't aged well at all."
"Dec 27, 2011",NEUTRAL,"When the only truly pure being on Earth is taken by a Demon and his bizarre, circus freak troupe of minions from the holy place where he is being raised who you gonna call?

In this case Chandler Jarrell (Eddie Murphy), a private investigator who focuses on locating missing children while wearing ridiculous hats.

But Chandler sez ""No"" when initially asked by the exotic-hot Kee, who is working on behalf of the Tibetan forces of good - some business card that would be.

""No matter"", she replies, ""You are already on the case"". So Na-Na to you Mr Jarrell.

Jarrell is fast talking, hip, and irreverent but well meaning - in other words everything that summed up Eddie Murphy in his ""relevant"" phase, which ended around the release of Boomerang when Murphy got all serious and introspective and sh*t.

Kee on the other hand is poised, deliberate, sombre and calm, but surprisingly well equipped at unexpected times - and I'm not just referring to the scene where she gets her white blouse soaked for no good reason... well two good reasons.

After the two team up the trail takes them to the lair of a bikie gang, then Chinatown where they meet Kala the Oracle (of sorts) who informs Chandler of the magnitude of his quest - being that he is the Chosen One after all...

Chandler also learns that the Golden Child is a once in a thousand generations birth, born specifically to rescue humanity, capable of restoring life with a touch, wise beyond reason and with the ability to make a Pepsi can dance to classic 1950s songs...

So there's that.

There is a cool oddball dream sequence and a trip to Tibet to obtain the sacred dagger that can free the imprisoned Golden Child, and a pretty hilarious scene where Chandler and Kee have to bluff the airport security to escape from Tibet.

When finally meets his nemesis Sardo Numspaa (Charles Dance) formally to discuss the dagger for child swap things heat up, before a good quickie 80s finale in which everything builds to a crescendo, the figureheads of good and evil have a showdown and all is resolved in about 6 minutes.

Perhaps The Golden Child doesn't move quite as fast as films do today and the FX - which were pretty cool in the 80s - don't hold up quite so well now, it is fun and enjoyable while it lasts and also has a few quotables, including ""One of her ancestors was raped by a dragon"", which is a line you don't hear every day.

Final Rating - 6.5 / 10. Not often listed among Eddie Murphy's highlights, but The Golden Child is a very solid and worthwhile - if a little dated - relic from the 80s.

"Dec 4, 2011",NEUTRAL,"I never got to see this movie as a child... and I should have skipped it as an adult as well. Then again, I was never a fan of Eddie Murphy, it is amazing how a bit of bad 80s slapstick humour can destroy what could have been an interesting movie."
"Nov 21, 2011",NEUTRAL,Eddie Murphy during the peak period of his career with this 80's comedy classic.
"Nov 13, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Cheesy 80's movie that's fun, watched it a lot as a kid.  Worth it for Murphy fans."
"Nov 12, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Chandler Jarrell (Eddie Murphy) is a social worker who's looking for a missing young girl. While searching for her, he is confronted by a woman (Charlotte Lewis) who tells him that he is the chosen one, who is destined to save The Golden Child, the savior of all mankind, from the clutches of the demon Sardo Numpsa (Charles Dance).

The film promoted itself first and foremost as a comedy, mainly due to the fact that Eddie Murphy was the lead actor, but the film's jokes don't really come off as actually being funny, they're just too basic to actually make you laugh. In fact, the film was supposed to be a serious adventure film until Murphy took the lead role, which lead to what feels like a clash between the ""comedic"" moments and the many dark moments that occur.

Eddie Murphy played Chandler Jarrell, who is the chosen one destined to save the golden child. While I can buy Murphy as an action star like in Beverly Hills Cop, I can not see him as the star of a supernatural fantasy like in this film. Plus, no matter what issues I have with the character, Murphy is still a thousand times better here than in any of his latest fat-suit or family friendly films.

Charlotte Lewis plays Kee Nang, the lady who gets Chandler Jarrell to know of his destiny as the chosen one. While I did like how she was a kick-ass female character rather than a screeching damsel, her character was pretty uninteresting, and I did not see any chemistry between her character and Murphy's, leaving me to not buy into their obligatory relationship.

Charles Dance plays the role of the villain, Sardo Numpsa, which is problematic as Dance isn't the slightest bit intimindating as the villain, and it doesn't help how ridiculous his name actually sounds. Plus, they reveal how he is a demon in such an off-handed, half-arsed way that it feels more like a mention than an actual reveal. I also did not get why Numpsa had trouble with pronouncing J's, was this supposed to be part of the comedy? Because if so, it definitely failed.

The Mythology behind the Golden Child and The Chosen One is poorly explained at a rushed pace, leaving holes in many places, like The Golden Child's powers. They aren't actually explained, so we don't know what he can do, and this leads to powers being revealed only because they're relevant to the plot at that point, leaving you feeling a bit infuriated.

It's not just the mythology which is poorly explained, as many things happen all throughout the film, leaving us viewers with questions that go unanswered, like a certain guard who suddenly switches sides and helps Jarrell, who is then never seen again. Also, the dream transmition, which is only explained as being part dream and part reality, never explained how the dream and reality could mix into one plane.

I know this film was made in the 80's, but the effects are really cheap looking, and the film doesn't go to any lengths to conceal how cheap they look. I also found the editing to be bad, as scenes ended abruptly and shots were randomly cut out. The action wasn't very well choreographed either. The ending is also problematic, feeling like it was rushed into delivering a happy ending that wrapped everything up.

The Golden Child is a problematic film that claims to be a comedy, but doesn't come across as being that funny, whilst leaving many unanswered questions, and suffering from an unconvincing villain, bad editing, effects and action sequences. With that said, Murphy's acting was the best thing about this film, and no matter how bad the movie was, you never felt bored throughout, and this isn't a terrible film, just quite below mediocre."

Sadly, these were the best times for comedian Eddie Murphy, considerably falling out of favor with me after the eighties. <i>The Golden Child</i> is similiar to the film <i>Big Trouble In Little China</i>, but with less concentration on the special effects. Most of the scenes felt unfinished and the dialogue rushed. The ad-libbing of Murphy was the only saving grace to the film, but I'm not putting the film down. You have to remember this film was made in the eighties and to hold such an entertaining factor as <i>The Golden Child</i> did, is quite impressive. There's nothing awe-inspiring to the film, it's just a dose of good entertainment."

"Jan 3, 2011",NEUTRAL,"I loved this movie. He appeared to have a great time with his part as Chandler Jarrell and he should never care about what the critics say, if he had fun doing it - and most of his audience enjoyed it! And, it WAS fun to watch as it combined some great fantasy tension with Mr. Murphy's great comedic style. You have to keep in mind that 'Golden Child' is a 'fantasy' film - just an imaginative work of magic and wonder amidst the 'real' world. During the time this film was released, I was working in a video rental store. This was one of the most popular with all our customers. Every single time, we put this one up on our monitor, ALL the copies we had went out fast with wait-list requests that kept it on the queue for months! Everyone who rented it loved it! I was the resident film critic and all my regular customers would ask my opinion before they rented - this was one of my favorites and I knew the taste of my customers so I highly recommended this one to most of them. I really feel that this film is a Sleeper - it may not have done too well at the box office - due to very poor marketing - but it hit a high in the video rental and purchase market later! (YES, I did buy this film for my own video library!). I adored the little boy who played the 'Golden Child' - J. L. Reate - but after looking at his profile in IMDb, I noticed that he never did any more films. That is sad, because he definitely had an on-screen aura and could have continued with a film career. I also adored Victor Wong, who played the Old Man (I LOVED him in his part as 'Egg Shen' in 'Big Trouble in Little China' - 1986). At any rate, this was a great film. The only drawbacks that didn't seem to fit with the theme were some of the parts that got a bit more 'adult' in nature - such as 'Chandler's rather sexual remarks about the serpent lady that was presented to him as a silhouette. It was funny, but it still was out of sync. OK, so there were a few suggestive gratuitous scenes - those were put in for the mind-set of the day perhaps. This was still an adventurous and escapist type of film which we do need today to get away from all the hard core reality and depressing fluff that we are hit with from Hollywood. Now that's Entertainment!"
"Dec 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Eddie Murphy is a finder of lost and missing children who is approached by a mysterious Tibetan woman (Charlotte Lewis) and told that he is ""The Chosen One"" and that it is his destiny to find and rescue a Tibetan boy with mystical powers from a race of demons, lead by Charles Dance as the evil Sardo Numspa  who wants to rule the world. The classic irony of Murphy does not fail, and the special effects are relatively good for a film of that 80's period."

"Oct 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Great film funny, good story and kung-fu."
"Oct 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,A typical and predictable story. Not Eddie Murphy's best performance.
"Oct 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,"As originally conceived, The Golden Child was supposed to be a serious action drama about a Tibetan holy child kidnapped by evil forces who want to use a mystical dagger to sacrifice him to demonic spirits. It was supposed to star Mel Gibson and be directed by John Carpenter. For reasons unknown, Gibson passed on the project, and it went to Eddie Murphy. The script was then rewritten - and mostly improvised - as an action comedy, which was more suited to Eddie Murphy's style and built in audience. And thus Eddie Murphy became Chandler Jarrell, a detective who specializes in searching for missing children, and who is hired by a mysterious Tibetan woman because he is believed to be The Chosen One. It was an odd choice for Murphy, who truly was The Chosen One at that point in his career. He had just finished three incredibly successful films: 48 Hrs, Trading Places, and Beverly Hills Cop. What's particularly interesting about the role, and what makes it almost impossible to imagine The Golden Child as a serious action film, is that Jarrell's power seems to be his quick wit and sense of humor. He's not a particularly good fighter, he doesn't suddenly develop magical abilities, and he manages to save the day through sheer blind stupid luck. Being a smartass is Jarrell's super power, and during the 1980s, that was Murphy's bread and butter. To the point you watch The Golden Child not for the terribly wrought and jagged storyline, but rather to see Murphy's overwhelmingly hilarious performance. It's that rare Hollywood gem where you get an actor in his prime swooping in on a project and completely dominating it with their performance until their presence outshines anything else in the film.

Everything of note worth mentioning in the eminently quotable film comes out of Murphy's bravura performance. There are the tattered bones of a story underneath, straw men set up to be set on fire by the comedy styling of Eddie Murphy. Basic gist - a group of strange evil weirdos bully into a Tibetan monastery and kidnap The Golden Child in a strange egg cage. Chandler Jarrell, whose latest case turns up dead with a mysterious dragon tattoo, gets hired by the forces of good to find the missing Golden Child. The cases intersect. The evil forces drained Cheryl of blood in order to try and fool the Golden Child into consuming blood, thus weakening his powers. Which mostly consist of telekinesis and the ability to bring dead animals back to life. The forces of evil, in the form of the quintessential 80's demonic villain Sardo Numspa (Charles Dance), appear to Jarrell in a dream and offer to exchange the Golden Child for the sacred dagger of Ajante, which is also the only weapon which can kill the Golden Child. Jarrell goes to Tibet, blah blah blah, and there's a big demonic showdown, whatever.
Which is kind of how the film is shot. Every scene basically seems to be set up to let Eddie Murphy improv something hilarious. You can actually see it in several of the shots. The other actors are genuinely startled and trying not to laugh. This is not poor planning on the part of director Michael Ritchie, who had worked previously with Chevy Chase on Fletch. For all intents and purposes, The Golden Child has a similar premise as Fletch. A mystery is afoot, but mostly this film exists as an excuse for the hero to be hilarious. What makes Chandler Jarrell such an interesting hero is that he isn't one. He's a cad, a loud mouth, rule-breaking, smartass. He has to get his ass saved by the girl for most of the movie. Kee Nang (Charlotte Lewis) has to break in and rescue him from the bikers, and she's the one taking down most of the bad guys when the house gets assaulted. The major fight of the movie against Numspa consists mostly of Jarrell running away, carrying the Tibetan holy child under one arm like luggage, while being pursued by this winged demon. He can't even finish him off without distractive help from The Golden Child.

Jarrell's only ability, and the only reason to watch this film, is his disrespectful behavior. He's easily pissed off, sarcastic, and totally disrespectful. His only seemingly moderate adversary is Victor Wong's crude old monk. He gives as good as he gets, belching, farting, picking his nose. He doesn't cotton to Chandler's bullshit. The famous scene in the monastery is a prime example. Kee spins the talking column and intones for permission to seek the dagger. When the monk demands Jarrell request it, he stands up from the slouched recline on the column, and scratches it like a rap album, grunting, ""I said, I-I-I-I want the kniiiiiiife."" Even when the monk calls him on his disrespect, he STILL manages to be a smartass. To get the dagger back to America and through customs past Sardo Numspa, Jarrell uses his quick wit again, and I can't begin to fathom how the original script worked that scene. It's entirely through Murphy's performance that the moment works.

What Murphy did with The Golden Child was to basically recreate his own version of the wise old slave narratives from African-American literary tradition. It's like Brer Rabbit. He can't use his fists to beat the bad guys, so he's going to use his wits. And it works. It's a bizarre goddamn film, but it totally and completely works for Murphy. He creates a hero, in a mystical action fantasy, that's able to fight with his mouth and win. But Murphy had the chops in the 1980's to pull off that kind of role. There aren't any heroes who fight with just their wits anymore. Nobody's doing that, and especially not in the black film community. The next actor to take the torch from Murphy was more or less Wesley Snipes in the 1990s, who made roles his own in Demolition Man and Passenger 57 that were totally not intended for a black actor. He kept the lingo and the attitude, but he made it more about the martial arts. Snipes was less concerned about being wise than being sleek and cool. And then the torch is now in Will Smith's hands, and he's doing it wrong. Will Smith is a very strong actor, and a very strong comedic actor, but he desperately craves respectability. Will Smith would win an Academy Award if he stopped trying so goddamn hard to win an Academy Award.

Our heroes can be funny, but nobody fights on wits alone anymore. The closest approximation to this is Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow - a performance (that got him an Oscar nomination, Will) - so embodied with rascal nature that it outshines the dumbest of plots. And a strong funny performance can do that. Because the story behind Murphy's performance is fucking terrible. It cataclysmically erupts in the third act, only held together barely by Murphy's previous hour's worth of performance. Strangely, the last film to have a good anti-hero who wasn't so good with the fighting was Jack Burton in Big Trouble In Little China, which Carpenter made the same year The Golden Child came out. And with many of the same actors. Tommy Tong with the hook swords plays Rain, Mr. Hong is David Lopan, and the shitty little monk is Egg Shen. But even Burton belongs to the Ash Williams school of kick ass and catchphrase, and not the smart smartass. I'd really like to see filmmakers bring back a hero who barely saves the day, but until then, I'll just keep watching The Golden Child. Hard."

My dear brother numpsy you have forgiven me...everyone my brother has forgiven me... ha ha classic stuff I felt it was on the same lines as big trouble in little china in its atmosphere but with a greater sense of humor maybe because some of the cast was the same or it once again has some chinese mysticism in it but it makes for a classic well worth the watch

The evil-villain-guy  (CHARLES DANCE) keeps calling EDDIE MURPHY ""MR. YARRELL"" and annoying him. . .

This one only starred EDDIE MURPHY, EDDIE MURPHY'S other films always had an ensemble cast of energetic supporting characters and/or co-stars.

Oohh wweeeeeee!!!"
"Jan 11, 2010",NEUTRAL,"i really wanted to like this as it was made in the 80's and featured some of that clash of the titan type animation. sadly though it never lived up to how i wanted to see it... you gotta be kidding me that eddie murphy is the 'chosen one' and the fate of the world lies in his hands!? either be a comedy or be an action, its struggles to identify itself throughout and as a result gives a poor performance.

if they cast someone else into the role (kurt russell, van damme, anyone but eddie) then we might of talked about this as the movie that 'could of been big trouble... but is still an 80's go to'."
"Jan 10, 2010",NEUTRAL,the only murphy movie i can actually stand to watch.
"Jan 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,"A mismash of genres; comedy,martial arts & horror that works very well. Similar to Big Trouble in Little China but not quite as good but very close."
"Jan 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,it may come off as corny by todays standards but it is still a fun movie to sit down and watch.
"Jan 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,"comedy 80's value. murphy is superb, not one of his more ecognised movies but a classic tale none the less. the demon graphics at the end are cheese central but a good show none the less"

"Dec 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,"My dear, sweet brother Numsie!"

"Dec 1, 2009",NEUTRAL,undemanding family hocus pocus
"Nov 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,"This was probably one of Eddie Murphy's better acting movies, but the movie didn't say much. I mean it was kind of out of wack and seemed to not have the right cast. The story was enjoyable and entertaining, but as a whole, it seemed to be missing a lot. I guess they will try anything in the 80's."
"Nov 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Oh, Eddie... if only you'd found your way to Disney sooner. Then at least we wouldn't have been fooled into believing that you might make something almost as funny as ""Trading Places"" again."
"Nov 26, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Murphy is annoyingly not funny in this, but i love the demon Charles Dance turns into at the end."
"Nov 22, 2009",NEUTRAL,Just okay. Not really that funny.

"Nov 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,Another classic & must see. I said I got the knife. Let me pass. PLEASEEEEEEEE!!!
"Oct 14, 2009",NEUTRAL,I know this flick off by heart. classic jokes!
"Oct 14, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The number one movie of 1986, in my eyes at least, The Golden Child. One of Eddie Murphy's best comedic roles before his downfall of Dr Dolittles and Pluto Nashs. Once he lost his signature laugh it was over. But I digress, The Golden Child was a classic 80's movie. With amazing graphics from a pepsi can tap dancing via ""Put it on the Ritz"" to a teleporting demon who at times has a stuttering issue, this movie is non-stop laughs and enjoyment."

"Aug 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,Watchable.  Love the bottlecap stop motion segment!
"Aug 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Once upon a time, Eddie Murphy's name above a film title meant something. Once upon a time, Eddie Murphy wasn't a comedic joke who played multiple roles in forgettable comedies. That time was the 1980s, with hits like Trading Places and the Beverly Hills Cop films. The Golden Child fell into that period, but it was one of his rare mis-steps. Originally conceived as a serious drama to star Mel Gibson, before being changed into an Eddie Murphy comedy at the final hour. Unfortunately, it seems that, in this transitionary period, they forgot to actually insert any jokes or funny scenarios. The mystical plotline, which could have been comedic golddust, is played dead seriously and so the tone feels disjointed. Murphy is on autopilot throughout, and where the film should be fun and breezy it is merely lethargic and dull. It gains bonus points for having Charles Dance as a shape-shifting demon though."
"Jul 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,Eddie Murphy is a great actor
"Jul 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Eddie Murphie again shows he's got the talent.

"Jul 3, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Silly  most the time, but addictive."
"Jul 3, 2009",NEUTRAL,good performance by Eddy. Action and comedy fits this movie well.
"Jul 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,"One of Eddie Murphy's goofiest movies.  It has a crazy plot about an L.A. social worker who is told he is the Chosen One to save a mystical kidnapped Dalai Lama-like child (J.L. Reate) from the devil.  If he fails, the world will suffer a horrible fate.  The effects are dated and the plot a bit ridiculous, but Murphy is actually funny and the whole movie has a certain B-movie charm.  A notorious critical flop at the time of its release (though it made nearly $80 million domestically), yet the comic actor has been seen in far worse since then."
"Jun 16, 2009",NEUTRAL,Heheh... remember when Eddie Murphy was funny?
"Jun 13, 2009",NEUTRAL,"My first instinct is to write off any movie dubbing Eddie Murphy ""The Chosen One,"" but, in this case, it made for some quality entertainment."

"Feb 22, 2009",NEUTRAL,"With Tibetan mysticism, Eddie Murphy's smart ass one-liners, '80s special effects, and the lovable Victor Wong, you can't go wrong. James Hong is along for the ride, but I prefer his presence in ""Big Trouble in Little China"" (he owned as Lo Pan). Charles Dance provides a wicked performance as the villain. He exudes an entertaining array of contempt for our clueless hero. Flixster muddies its plot synopsis with negative criticism.  Is it so hard to cite the back of the flick's case? Let the viewers be the judge."

Following that movie, Murphy starred in this ill-conceived fantasy which I would call moronic but that would only be an insult to morons. Compared to John Carpenter's underrated BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA (1986) this film blows. Charlotte Lew (aka Charlotte Lewis) gets the thankless role of being the increasingly crass and sexist Murphy's love interest which means she comes to his rescue and beats up a bunch of bikers wearing very wet clothes! What a positive role model for young women in 1986."

Obviously Charlotte Lewis went on to redeem herself by appearing in several Red Shoe Diaries, so it's not as if the cast lost out. And this is obviously the gig that enabled Charles Dance (the thinking woman's crumpet of the 80s) to clinch his oscar winning role in 'The Last Action Hero'. What else is there to say?

A lot of people love [i]48 Hrs.[/i] I, apparently, missed something. I found this film to be quite the chore to sit through. Honestly, how could you go wrong with Nolte and Murphy? Nolte is one of the finest actors in history, and Murphy, while he's strayed from time to time [i](The Adventures of Pluto Nash[/i], [i]Vampire in Brooklyn[/i])[i],[/i] is usually funny as hell.

[center][i]Totally underrated weirdo comedy that's as old as I am.[/i][/center]
 
I grew up with [i]The Golden Child[/i]. I enjoyed it then much more than I enjoy it now (thankfully, sense kicked in around the middle of my freshman year), but it's still totally underrated and endlessly entertaining. The story is so silly and ludicrous, and it's not really necessary to delve into in a review. Eddie Murphy does not belong here, but he makes it his own, and the film is actually made better due to his presence. I haven't yet seen [i]Big Trouble in Little China[/i], but I'll bet it's similar to this ridiculous movie. [b]**1/2 (out of ****) B-[/b]

[center][i]Hilarious, if completely silly, stuff.[/i][/center]
 
Ted Demme's [i]Life[/i] is hilarious and entertaining, but it's sadly nothing more. I did love the costumes and the fact that, for no apparent reason, this is a period piece comedy, but it's not particularly great as a film. It's funny and original enough, though, to merit multiple viewings. I enjoy the hell out of it. Murphy is the funnier of the two, but Martin has his good scenes. I love their back-and-forth bickering. It reminded me of memories. Weird. [b]*** (out of ****) B[/b]

[center][i]One of Martin's best scripts, and Murphy is amazing.[/i][/center]
 
One of Steve Martin's best scripts and one of Eddie Murphy's very best performances are the best little pieces of Frank Oz's hilarious and enjoyably silly tinseltown satire, [i]Bowfinger[/i]. I really just loved this film almost all the way through. Steve Martin's performance as a failed filmmaker is perfect, and the supporting cast (from a hilariously stoic Terence Stamp to a typically pompous Robert Downey, Jr.) is equally wonderful. I really like this movie. It needed to be longer. Director's Cut? [b]***1/2 (out of ****) A-[/b]

Of all of Eddie Murphy's carrer choices, I honestly least prefer him when he's watching his mouth. In family fare ([i]The Haunted Mansion[/i], the dreadful [i]Daddy Day Care[/i]), I really just want him to go nuts on an improv rant, but he won't. While [i]Holy Man[/i] isn't really what one would think of as a ""family film,"" it is rated PG, and therefore doesn't contain any really funny Eddie. I have a thing with swearing - it makes everyting funnier. All that and I didn't mention that the film itself is a bore featuring wasted talent and some manipulative sentimentality. Yay.

/profiles/YkluGvH91I2WCgGSPKSDjT1jH6n,NEUTRAL,"A movie with Eddie Murphy trying to rescue a ""golden child"" from the clutches of evil. It's not a child made of gold per se, but it's a child with a heart so pure it could be made of gold, this child know nothing about evil, he can bring life with his bare touch and is protected by a bunch of monks that now try to locate their ""stolen child"". Eddie Murphy tries to rescue the child and naturally gets into a lot of trouble with the evil forces. The movie is made real ""Eddie Murphy style"" - meaning it has a lot of up-beat catchy tunes in it, and there is a lot of action adventure with a good dose of his humor without becoming too tacky. It's a movie that you can see again and again."

/profiles/qAkIOBFpWHlwiRLsz1h9LfkxIzK,NEUTRAL,"<i><b> Not even Eddie Murphy's normal bag of tricks and tics can save this contrived and unconvincing film from self-destructing. An uneven and staid mystical bore that miscasts Murphy something fierce. There's nothing Golden about this neglected Child. It's hard to blame Ritchie, though. In Hollywood they almost force movie stars to become 600-pound gorillas, and there's every reason to believe Murphy has put on some avoirdupois. Needless to say, in any dispute between a journeyman director and Paramount's most bankable asset, there's no mistaking where the studio would stand. They'd rather see Murphy grow into what he has every intention of becoming -- the Sylvester Stallone of comedy. Worst of all, Ritchie has taken Dennis Feldman's script and turned what might have been a lovely fantasy -- about a man jaded by the sordidness of L.A. who renews his faith -- into a half-baked comedy without a heart. Nonetheless, this film -- insignificant and lightweight and monumentally silly -- is entertaining from beginning to end for Eddie Murphy fans. <i></b>

But the devil isn't idle, sending his emissary, Sardo Numspa (Charles Dance) to kidnap the golden child. Sardo absconds with the child and takes off to Los Angeles. In L.A., a beautiful Tibetan priestess named Kee Nang (Charlotte Lewis) seeks out Chandler Jarrell (Eddie Murphy), a social worker and self-styled ""finder of lost children."" She tells Chandler he has been chosen to rescue the magical child from the devil and save the world from evil. Before Chandler can let go of his first riposte, he finds himself holding a magic dagger, following a sacred parakeet, and under-going several trials by fire. He also falls in love with Kee Nang, who at one point in the film has to be brought back from the dead."

Great opening scene of the child being kidnapped with some rockin' 80's music. Eddie Murphy's character I was totally with throughout.

I loved the scene when the child amused the beast-man with a dancing cola-can. The fights and creatures were wonderful.

This isn't nearly as bad a movie as people make it out to be. It's just infuriating because it misses a bunch of great chances to be entertaining. It could be an adventure flick or an East-meets-West comedy or a child abduction tale. In the end, it's none of these things. It settles for being a run-of-the-mill action comedy that doesn't bear any imprint of its star's presence. Despite questionable reviews, the film still grossed just under $80 million. It plays on AMC all the time, which is admittedly kind of sad. Commercial breaks between all the poorly organized inanity might actually help this thing out, though. Then again, maybe not."

[font=Arial][size=3][color=#000000]Chandler Jarrell is a street savvy detective, of sorts, that assists police in missing childrens cases.  He is kind of a free lance, how he makes money doing this is never explained.  Nevertheless, one day an attractive young lady walks up to him and asks for his assistance in finding a kidnapped child from Tibet.  She informs him the child is the Golden Child here to save the Earth and he is the chosen one to rescue him.  Chandler Jarrell of course believes she is off her rocker but decides to help her in her search, as her missing child seems to be correlated with a case he is currently working on.  What Jarrell does not know is this case is going to take him on wild adventures to Tibet, introduce him to mythical creatures and demons, and he may even fall in love.[/color][/size][/font]

Ritchie took Murphy and placed him in a different type of role.  The Golden Child gets a lot of flack for Murphy not being the right part; however I think he was perfect.  I compare Murphys performance in this film to Kurt Russells performance in Big Trouble in Little China.  It is funny people believe Eddie Murphy was the wrong person for this role, however, the role of Beverly Hills Cop was written for Sylvester Stallone, who turned the role down, and Eddie Murphy took that part.  Could you imagine anyone else being in Beverly Hills cop other then Eddie Murphy?[/color][/size][/font]

[font=Arial][size=3][color=#000000] [/color][/size][/font]

[font=Arial][size=3][color=#000000]I thought the actions sequences and scenery was done very well in this movie.  Lets remember this film was from 1986.  There was a strong Big Trouble in Little China feel to the film, and it even utilized three characters from that movie.  If you did not notice, Tommie Tong was one of the three spirits in big trouble in little china, the shop keeper who takes Murphy to the snake lady, and the girls father/the naked guy selling necklaces were all in Big Trouble in Little China.  The Pepsi can trick conducted by the Golden Child was amazing, especially for being a 1986 film.  I will admit that the voice of the devil, while talking to the demon, was a bit cheesy.  Also notice that the villain was the same guy that was the villain in Last Action Hero.[/color][/size][/font]

[font=Arial][size=3][color=#000000] [/color][/size][/font]

[font=Arial][size=3][color=#000000]I agree that there are plenty of Murphy films better then the Golden Child; this list would include Coming to America, Harlem Nights, Trading Places, both 48 hour movies, and the Beverly Hills Cop collection.  Yes, I agree with that take on the film.  Nevertheless, it does not make this a bad film; it just shows what an impressive resume Murphy has.  I placed this film on my must have list, right along with the other DVDs I just listed.  Golden Child is a better then advertised film, and received negative reviews unjustly, as this was Murphys first dabble in this genre of film.  Give this film a chance if you have never seen it.[/color][/size][/font]

Townsend also stars in the film as an aspiring actor who must choose between taking stereotypical African American roles or sticking to his principles.  The film is uneven but extremely funny at times.  This film is also notable as it helped kickstart the careers of Keenen Ivory Wayans and Damon Wayans.
 
The Golden Child is a mess of a film that doesn't know what it wants to be basically hoping the enormous popularity of Eddie Murphy (at that time) can rescue it.  He can't.  
 
Revenge of the Nerds is a failed attempt at Animal House humor, this time starring a bunch of Nerds.  Hugely popular, it spawned a series of sequels.  
 
The Money Pit, starring Tom Hanks and Shelley Long, is a story about a cursed house that relies too much on gags.  A failed attempt at slapstick comedy.
