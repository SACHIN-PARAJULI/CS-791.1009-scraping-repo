"Jun 21, 2023",NEGATIVE," Chandler Jarrell (Eddie Murphy) is a Los Angeles social worker who specialises in finding missing children. When he is approached to locate a kidnapped child mystic known as the Golden Child, Chandler is incredulous – but before long he is neck-deep in a world of magic, murder, snake-women, and demons. The Golden Child was an odd feature film project back in 1986. Originally developed as a supernatural detective story to star Mel Gibson, it was offered to and rejected by John Carpenter before being re-imagined as an action-comedy vehicle for Eddie Murphy. Murphy had his eye on appearing in Star Trek IV at the time, but was convinced to lend his talents to this instead. After all, why waste Murphy’s box office appeal on a film that was likely to be profitable with or without him? So Star Trek IV was a commercial success without Murphy’s help, and John Carpenter found his own Chinese-themed urban fantasy to direct (Big Trouble in Little China). Eddie Murphy starred in The Golden Child: an odd bastard child of unsuccessful rewrites, and an action-comedy with little action and not much humour. What comedy there is comes from Murphy’s standard quick wit and funny repartee. Attempts beyond that either fall flat, or simply are not there at all. Charlotte Lewis suffers particularly as sidekick Kee Nang. She gets very little to do, and despite some early action sequences winds up serving as a victim for the protagonist to rescue. Charles Dance plays the villainous – and ridiculously named – Sardo Numspa. He plays the part in a classic British fashion of shutting one’s eyes, thinking of England, and collecting a paycheck – a technique perfected by Jeremy Irons over the years. Honestly there is not much for him to do. There is not much for anybody to do. The film is dreadfully under-written. You can still sort of see the more hard-boiled detective version of the story if you turn your head and squint a bit, and you can definitely see the influence of Steven Spielberg’s Indiana Jones films on the end result. It is even possible to see the potential of shifting Eddie Murphy out of comedy and into action-fantasy. There is a version of The Golden Child that would work – and work well. All that is missing is iconic action, better dialogue, an interesting plot, and some kind of realised characters. Some times there is an urge to revisit an old movie, to see if perhaps it was better than one remembered, or some kind of ‘ahead-of-it’s-time’ gem. The Golden Child is neither of these things. It is patchy, underwhelming, and ultimately a little dispiriting. The ingredients are decent. The recipe is sour."

"Dec 9, 2020",NEUTRAL," “Eddie Murphy is the Chosen One” proclaimed the one sheets and trailers for The Golden Child, which pretty much summarizes the film’s goal and its appeal. Murphy had shot to massive stardom in the early 1980s playing cocksure outsiders upending various systems in 48 Hrs. (1982), Trading Places (1983), and Beverly Hills Cop (1984), the latter of which was the highest grossing film of that year and established sky-high expectations for any subsequent Murphy starring vehicle. In hindsight, The Golden Child, an effects-heavy action-fantasy hybrid, feels like a particularly strange film for the comedian-star, and the fact that it failed to live up to Cop’s boffo box office proved an early stumble for Murphy (although it should be noted that it still ranked in the top 10 for 1986 and was the eighth highest selling video title of 1987). Like Beverly Hills Cop, which was the first feature film produced in association with Eddie Murphy’s production company, The Golden Child was retrofitted for Murphy. The screenplay by Dennis Feldman, who had previously written the teen comedy Just One of the Guys (1985) and would go on to specialize in sci-fi/horror hybrids like Species (1995) and Virus (1999), was originally conceived as a straightforward fantasy film. Once Murphy became interested in the project, the script was retooled to accommodate his comic persona, which doesn’t always sit comfortably with its action-fantasy components (there is a surprising amount of blood throughout the film, and the bombast of the special-effects-heavy climax leaves little room for jokes). Nevertheless, if Murphy could be inserted into a project originally intended for Sylvester Stallone, as was the case with Cop, surely he could integrate himself into the exotic supernaturalism of The Golden Child. Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a Los Angeles social worker who specializes in missing children and is drawn into a plot involving the eponymous child (J.L. Reate), a mystical Tibetan tyke who is kidnapped by Sardo Numspa (Charles Dance), a demon in human form who wants to kill him and take his powers. Chandler is approached by Kee Nang (Charlotte Lewis), a young woman with secret connections to the Golden Child, to aid in his rescue. Her informing Chandler that he is “the chosen one” is met with expected bemusement, although like any secular character in a horror or fantasy film, Chandler will soon learn that his understanding of the world is severely limited.  In fact, much of the film’s comedy derives from Chandler’s overconfidence in his conception of reality and the laws of physics being constantly undercut by the supernatural world into which he is thrust. The payoff of this comedic gambit is uneven, with some scenes working fantastically, while others just feel forced. There are some sly challenges to Chandler’s status as traditional masculine hero when Kee regularly demonstrates her superior physicality and fighting ability against Chandler’s constant admonition for her to “stay in the car” (her becoming his romantic love interest is not unexpected, but Murphy and Lewis have no chemistry, so it feels like nothing more than a de rigeur plot point). At other times Murphy just plays scenes loud and jarring, which probably satiated his fans at the time, but now feel like lazy gambits that rely too heavily on Murphy’s already established Axel Foley persona. Some of the best scenes involve Murphy and Dance going toe to toe, with Dance playing up Sardo’s campy continental villainy while Murphy blithely insults him at every turn, completely unaware of just how powerful he is (the surprised and peeved flick of Dance’s eyes in the airport scene when Murphy kisses him is priceless). Director Michael Ritchie had graduated from the ranks of television in the late 1960s with a series of challenging dramas and prescient comedies, including Downhill Racer (1969), The Candidate (1972), and The Bad News Bears (1976). By the time he helmed The Golden Child, his New Wave flourishes and stabs at social and political satire were long gone, as he had settled into a safe harbor of high-concept comedies built around established comic actors, including The Survivors (1983) with Walter Matthau and Robin Williams, Fletch (1985) with Chevy Chase, and Wildcats (1986) with Goldie Hawn. With The Golden Child, Ritchie mostly sits back and lets the large sets, big special effects (which tody have not aged well despite being the work of Lucasfilm’s Industrial Light & Magic), and mega-star do the heavy lifting. And The Golden Child is, at heart and in essence, an Eddie Murphy vehicle through and through, with little holding it together outside of the familiar cadences of his streetwise confidence and infectious laugh. In an interview during the film’s production, Murphy admits as much, telling the interviewer that he is first and foremost a stand-up comedian and he doesn’t think of himself as an actor at all. The character he is playing is really just a name attached to the persona of Eddie Murphy. As he puts it, “I don’t become Chandler Jarrell, I don’t become the character in the film. That’s my name, but I think pretty much the audience, if they’re coming to see the picture, I’m Eddie Murphy in the film.” In other words, it didn’t matter if he was battling snobbish Beverly Hills police officers, filthy rich investment tycoons, or human-disguised demons. What people wanted was Eddie Murphy, and that is exactly what they got here. James Kendrick offers, exclusively on Qnetwork, over 2,500 reviews on a wide range of films.

"Dec 7, 2020",NEUTRAL," In the early 1980's Eddie Murphy's career was on the rise.  With the success of Saturday Night Live and his budding movie career, it seemed he could practically do no wrong.  After starring in 48 Hours, Trading Places, and Beverly Hills Cop, it seemed the ""golden boy"" had the Midas touch.  Then came his next feature film, 1986's The Golden Child, and his string of successful movies came to an abrupt end.  Of course, Murphy got back on track, but the movie was one of the first lows in his long Hollywood career.  Since Coming 2 America is set to be released early next year, Paramount Presents decided it was time to celebrate Murphy's work and has included The Golden Child on their growing list of restored and re-released movies. In a small, Tibetan Temple a mysterious child (J.L. Reate) is surrounded by Monks.  He demonstrates his ""powers"" for the Monks by reviving a dead bird.  Suddenly, Sardo Numspa (Charles Dance; Last Action Hero) and his men break into the temple, kill the Monks and kidnap the child. Desperate to find the ""Golden Child"", Kee Nang (Charlotte Lewis; Men of War) enlists the help of social worker Chandler Jarrell (Murphy) to help her.  When a little girl that Chandler was looking for winds up dead outside a home spray-painted with Tibetan writing, Kee tells Chandler he is the ""chosen one"" who must save the child. Tracking down a motorcycle gang named the Yellow Dragons, Kee and Chandler discover Numspa had a henchman named Tommy Tong (Peter Kwong; Big Trouble in Little China).  The two also discover they must find the Ajanti Dagger, which can fatally wound the child.  They travel to Tibet, find the dagger, lose it to Numspa, help the child escape and ultimately kill the demon Numspa morphs into. Murphy, once again, plays ""the coolest guy in the room"", an act we have come to almost expect from him.  However, unlike in Beverly Hills Cop, that overconfident demeanor doesn't play as well here.  This character needed a bit more of a serious tone when involving the kidnapping and murder (or attempted murder) of two children.  Lewis is ok in the movie, but she and Murphy don't really have any chemistry making their ""relationship"" not very believable.  Dance has portrayed the villain several times in movies and the child-murdering demon in this movie isn't a stretch.  Reate is super cute though he doesn't say anything the entire time. This newest version of The Golden Child is part of the Paramount Presents series and is one of four Murphy films being released this month in anticipation of the theatrical release of Coming 2 America in early 2021.  The 1080p video quality is ok but not a huge change from previous releases.  The special effects, which may have been groundbreaking back in 1986, look dated, cheesy, and fake by today's standards.  The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 audio quality is decent as well with the dialogue and the highly synthesized 80's soundtrack creating a nice balance.  There are no new extras included with this release.  The previously released ones include: The Making of the Golden Child, The Chosen Ones, Daggers, Design and Demons, Theatrical Trailer, and the Digital HD Copy of the film. Murphy has had a number of hit films in his career, especially early on, and most recently received an Oscar nomination for Dolemite is My Name.  However, The Golden Child wasn't especially funny, nor was it all that interesting and has turned out to be among one of his weakest movies.  While Paramount Presents does it best to upgrade the video and audio for this release, there isn't anything that could be done to save the plot.

"Dec 5, 2020",NEUTRAL," CONTINENTAL DIVIDE (1981). Although Continental Divide was the first film released under Steven Spielberg’s Amblin banner, it’s best known as that movie where John Belushi plays a totally normal guy. And he’s quite good at it, delivering an easygoing turn as a Chicago newspaper columnist who hightails it to the Rockies to interview an ornithologist. But when Ernie Souchak and Nell Porter (Blair Brown) first meet, it’s clear they have nothing in common: He prefers city life, cigarettes, and booze; she prefers nature, animals, and tranquility. Naturally, they fall in love. It may be true that opposites attract, but there is so little common ground between these characters — none, in fact — that their romance is never believable. The film is at its best when it ignores their relationship and concentrates on other matters (Ernie tackling big-city corruption, Nell studying American bald eagles). Regardless of what’s happening in Lawrence Kasdan’s schematic screenplay, Belushi and Brown save the movie with their warmth and charm. D.C. CAB (1983). “Why are women so uptight? They’ve got half the money and all the pussy!” And so it goes with D.C. Cab, the sort of disreputable comedy that could only have been made during the 1980s. Like many faves of the period, it’s lewd, crude, and rude, but it deserves a salute for featuring as eclectic a cast as can be found this side of Otto Preminger’s Skidoo. Its plot is nothing more than the usual nonsense: Various misfits — in this case, taxi drivers — earn no respect until a crisis forces them to band together and save the day. Harold (Max Gail, Wojo on Barney Miller) runs the place, Albert (Adam Baldwin) is the new kid on the job, and the excitable Tyrone (Charlie Barnett) has a crush on Irene Cara (who appears as herself in a brief cameo). There’s also Mr. T as a conscientious cabbie, Gary Busey as a foul-mouthed joker, Bill Maher (yes, that Bill Maher) as a sensitive sort, Paul Rodriguez as a ladies’ man, The Barbarian Brothers (using up 5 of their 15 minutes of fame) as rowdy drivers, Whitman Mayo (Grady on Sanford and Son) as Mr. Rhythm, and Timothy Carey as the Angel of Death. Whew! Despite that roster, the movie’s not particularly funny, but a few six-packs could help. MULAN (2020). While 2019’s photorealistic remake of 1994’s The Lion King felt like Disney staging its own invasion of the body snatchers — everything looks the same, only stiff and emotionless! — this live-action Mulan thankfully avoids frigid fealty to its animated 1998 predecessor. Instead, it jettisons all of the songs, most of the knockabout humor, and even Mushu the scene-stealing dragon (Eddie Murphy in basically a test drive for Shrek), leaving behind a durable drama told with sweep and style. As before, Mulan (Yifei Liu) is a headstrong young woman who, learning that her frail father (Tzi Ma) must join the Imperial Army in a time of war, disguises herself as a man and takes his place on the battlefield. The silly scenes (e.g. Mulan, the matchmaker, and a tea set) are played too broadly and should have been removed, and the picture’s view of the Chinese notion of “chi” leans so heavily on Hollywood ideals that it’s surprising no one ever says, “May the Chi be with you.” But the story is inspiring, the action scenes are rousing, and cinematographer Mandy Walker’s shot selections are dazzling. All this plus the great Gong Li as a sympathetic villainess. THE NEW MUTANTS (2020). Despite all the production upheavals, all the conflicting visions, and all the false starts (when it comes to release dates, the film’s been bounced more than a ping pong ball), this middling X-Men entry is still superior to Dark Phoenix (reviewed here), the depressing dud that managed to kill off a once-proud franchise. Setting up a new series of X-rated adventures — but mangling the assignment so thoroughly that follow-ups are unlikely to materialize — this centers on five troubled teens confined to a remote hospital. The newcomer is the Native American Dani Moonstar (Blu Hunt), who becomes the instant BFF of the Scottish Rahne (Maisie Williams), gets along with the hickish Sam (Charlie Heaton) and the Brazilian Bobby (Henry Zaga), and runs afoul of the Russian Illyana (Anya Taylor-Joy). All are mutants with unique powers, but it isn’t until they pool their resources that they’re able to conquer their inner (and some outer) demons. Even with most of the film devoted to exposition, this feels unformed and unfinished, with half-baked YA interludes, ill-defined villains, and ungainly action sequences. POPEYE (1980). It’s easy to see why many critics viewed Popeye as an abomination upon its initial release; it’s also easy to understand why select reviewers declared it an unqualified winner. Those who can get on its wavelength will appreciate its eccentricities; those who cannot will find its whimsy the equivalent of waterboarding. Those who detest it will insist that the choice of Robert Altman as director was a horrific one; those who love it will insist his hiring was a stroke of genius. The overacting by all involved might be suitable for the project, but it’s uncured ham nevertheless. Robin Williams (Popeye) mumbles, Shelley Duvall (Olive Oyl) frets, Paul L. Smith (Bluto) roars, and I have no idea what Ray Walston (Poopdeck Pappy) is doing. The suitably dilapidated sets are certainly more impressive than the wince-inducing tunes by Harry Nilsson (I much prefer his charming tunes for 1971’s The Point, reviewed here). Blu-ray extras include archival interviews with Altman and Williams, photos from the movie’s 1980 premiere; and the option to cut to all the songs featured in the film. POSSESSOR UNCUT (2020). David Cronenberg’s first films were intriguing but also messy, muddled, and cold to the touch — they featured pawns rather than people, and the ideas often threatened to overpower the execution. His son Brandon Cronenberg might be offering a generational déjà vu, as his sophomore effort (I haven’t seen his first picture, Antiviral) unspools in similar fashion. Brandon has swiped his dad’s recurring obsessions — betrayal by one’s own body; loss of identity; the relationship between man and machine; the allure of sexual perversities — and applied them to this thriller about an outfit that employs brain-implant technology to place its agents inside the bodies of innocents to perform assassinations. As the group’s top killer (Andrea Riseborough) tries to carry out her latest assignment, she finds her subject (Christopher Abbott) unexpectedly fighting back. Some heady ideas are ultimately buried under the film’s lack of specificity and surplus of gore. TRADING PLACES (1983) / BEVERLY HILLS COP (1984) / THE GOLDEN CHILD (1986) / COMING TO AMERICA (1988). Beginning with his dynamic film debut in 1982’s 48 Hrs., Eddie Murphy headlined nothing but hits for a full decade, marking him as one of the most reliable box office draws of the 1980s and into the 1990s. Sadly, 48 Hrs. hasn’t been treated to a deluxe new release, but four other flicks from this robust period are being offered in newly remastered editions, two in 4K Ultra HD (Beverly Hills Cop and Coming to America) and two as part of the Paramount Presents series (Trading Places and The Golden Child, the latter also making its Blu-ray debut). A variation on Mark Twain’s The Prince and the Pauper, Trading Places teams Murphy with fellow Saturday Night Live player Dan Aykroyd for a sharp comedy in which a bet made by sleazy millionaires Randolph and Mortimer Duke (Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche) results in snobbish executive Louis Winthorpe III (Aykroyd) being left homeless and penniless while street-smart hustler Billy Ray Valentine (Murphy) is given Winthorpe’s house, job and finances. The two stars (especially Murphy) are terrific, and the supporting cast provides additional flavor: Bellamy and Ameche as the insidious Duke brothers and Denholm Elliott and Jamie Lee Curtis as, respectively, the butler and the hooker who assist our heroes. Murphy’s biggest hit, Beverly Hills Cop also remains noteworthy as the film that best makes use of his explosive comic instincts. He’s sensational as Detroit cop Axel Foley, sniffing out his best friend’s killers in swanky Beverly Hills with the help of by-the-book LA detectives Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and Taggart (John Ashton) and the hindrance of stern police captain Bogomil (Ronny Cox). This high-octane action-comedy was originally conceived as a vehicle for Sylvester Stallone, who (thankfully!) dropped out after many cast and crew members were already in place. Daniel Petrie Jr. and Danilo Bach earned an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, although so much of the dialogue was ad-libbed by Murphy that he probably deserved credit as well. This was followed by a pair of lamentable sequels. With The Golden Child, Murphy unfortunately (if unsurprisingly) morphs from Explosive Comic Talent to Narcissistic Action Star. No one else could have played Axel Foley, Billy Ray Valentine or 48 Hrs.’s Reggie Hammond quite like Murphy, whereas a dozen other actors could have tackled The Golden Child’s Chandler Jarrell in exactly the same preening, paycheck-cashing manner. After a Tibetan boy (J.L. Reate) with mystical powers is kidnapped by a demonic emissary (Charles Dance), those responsible for the child’s safety determine that Chandler, a Los Angeles social worker who specializes in finding missing children, is “The Chosen One” and thus the only person who can rescue the tyke. The Golden Child offers lots of special effects but little else that can be deemed special. Trading Places director John Landis reteams with Murphy five years later for Coming to America, a sweet-natured comedy with an R-rated edge. Murphy delivers one of his most gratifying performances as Prince Akeem, who, with his reluctant aide (Arsenio Hall) at his side, travels from his African homeland of Zamunda to New York City in the hopes of falling in love. Naturally, he elects to look for his future queen in Queens. James Earl Jones and Madge Sinclair play Akeem’s parents, King Jaffe Joffer and Queen Aoleon; six years later, the pair would reunite to portray another royal couple, Mufasa and Sarabi, in the animated smash The Lion King. Added bonus: The clever cameos that loop back to Trading Places. All four films are sold separately. Extras on Trading Places include a new discussion with Landis; a making-of featurette; and deleted scenes. Extras on Beverly Hills Cop include audio commentary by director Martin Brest; a making-of featurette; deleted scenes; and a piece on the music. Extras on The Golden Child include a new making-of featurette and the theatrical trailer. Extras on Coming to America (which is also available as a steelbook containing a bonus poster) include a making-of featurette; pieces on the contributions by makeup artist Rick Baker and costume designer Deborah Nadoolman, both of whom earned Oscar nominations for their work on the film; and a chat with Murphy and Hall."

"Jan 1, 2000",NEGATIVE,A half-baked comedy without a heart.
"Jan 1, 2000",POSITIVE," There are a lot of moments to remember in ""The Golden Child,"" but the one I will treasure the longest happens when Eddie Murphy gets behind the wheel of a beat-up station wagon and is led by a sacred parakeet to the lair of the devil. Maybe you had to be there. The parakeet, which has already made the round trip between Tibet and Los Angeles twice, chirps merrily and flies off down a dusty road. Murphy leans down to look up at it through his windshield, and the way he looks at it is what started me laughing. There is just something about the tilt of his head that seems entirely appropriate for a man who is following a sacred parakeet. Murphy is exactly right in that moment, but then he is exactly right all through this movie, which is utterly ridiculous and jolly good fun. I heard Paramount feared it had a bomb on its hands, but what were they worried about? The preview audience laughed all through the movie. No wonder, because this film - insignificant and lightweight and monumentally silly - is entertaining from beginning to end. Although it contains the usual scatological language, the sex and violence are mild. After agents from hell kidnap a holy child from Tibet, Murphy is recruited to recover the child, find a magic dagger, defeat Satan's henchmen, beat up some Hell's Angels, pass several death-defying trials by fire, follow the sacred parakeet and fall in love with the beautiful heroine, who must first be brought back from the dead. The movie's opening shots should have had a subtitle flashing Raiders Ripoff! Hollywood must have a whole industry supplying temples and gongs to the spawn of Indiana Jones. But from the moment Murphy appears on the screen, he makes the movie all his own; the special effects are basically just comic props. Murphy slides through the picture with easy wisecracks and unflappable cool, like a hip Bob Hope. A lot of the time, he seems to improvise his smart aleck one-liners - I haven't seen the script, so I can't say for sure. What's amazing is that his dialogue always seems to fit. A lot of stand-up comedians throw off the pacing in a movie by going for improv at the wrong moments (Robin Williams is sometimes an example). Murphy usually seems to have the perfect reaction, even when he's shocked to catch a wise old seer picking his nose. Maybe the director, Michael Ritchie, deserves some of the credit for that; he let Williams wreck his ""The Survivors"" with inappropriate one-liners, but this time everything flows. The movie's plot is an anthology of cliches from every Oriental swashbuckler in history; just off the top of my head I can remember a bottomless cavern, a 300-year-old woman with a dragon's tail, a child whose touch turns bad men into good ones, an evil spirit that turns into a serpent, several dozen temple guards, countless karate fights, secret rooms beneath the stores in Chinatown and, of course, the preternaturally beautiful heroine. Her name is Kee Nang, and she is played by Charlotte Lewis, the London schoolgirl who last starred in Roman Polanski's ""Pirates."" That movie won her an audience of dozens; this one likely will do a lot better. She looks very beautiful, and because that is her role in this movie, she fulfills it flawlessly. She also succeeds in keeping a straight face while Murphy uses her as the subject of speculation, rejection, romance and betrayal, and while she uses her effortless mastery of kung fu to protect him. No silly swashbuckler is any better than its villain, and the leader of the evil forces is played by Charles Dance, last seen as Meryl Streep's coldly intellectual husband in ""Plenty."" He, too, has to keep a straight face through this movie, in scenes such as the one where Murphy outsmarts him at airport customs and the scene where he turns into a rat. Victor Wong works well as a wise old man. ""The Golden Child"" may not be the Eddie Murphy movie we were waiting for, but it will do. It is funnier, more assured and more tailored to Murphy than ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and it shows a side of his comic persona that I don't think has been much appreciated: his essential underlying sweetness. Murphy's comedy is not based on hurt and aggression, but on affection and an understanding that comes from seeing right through the other characters. His famous laugh is not aimed as a weapon at anybody, but is truly amused. He is perfectly suited to survive this cheerfully ridiculous movie, and even lend it a little charm. Roger Ebert was the film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times from 1967 until his death in 2013. In 1975, he won the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished criticism."
