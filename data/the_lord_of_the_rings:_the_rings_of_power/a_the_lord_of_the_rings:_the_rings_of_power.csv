"Mar 4, 2024",NEUTRAL,One of the greatest movies ever made!
"Mar 3, 2024",NEUTRAL,"SPOILER WARNING
This movie is incredible and my personal favorite movie of all time (tied with the other two in the trilogy). There is so much to love in this movie so I summed it all up with this one scene. 

Remember the great stories, Mr. Frodo
This scene fills me with motivation even in the darkest of times. After Frodo is corrupted by the ring and is mentally forced to kill Samwise on the dark outskirts of Mordor, Frodo has lost all hope and doubts whether he should keep going or not. However, Samwise reminds him of the great stories, when heroes kept going even when times were tough and all looked lost. As Samwise's speech echoes onto the renowned battle of Helm's Deep and the flooding of Isengard, Frodo starts to realize that, even if it is but a tiny sliver, there is hope.

What makes this scene so emotional is that this happens to almost everyone. There will be a point in your life when you feel like nothing is left, and this scene is a beautiful reminder of why there is always a future no matter the circumstances. You are capable of so much and any human can push through anything, it just takes true will to do so.

This scene concludes the movie in spectacular fashion as things look bright for the battle of Helm's Deep and our heroes go on to continue their journey. My eyes fill with tears every time I hear Samwise the Brave talking over Howard Shore's beautiful score. This scene also portrays true brotherhood and that you can lift anyone (including yourself) up just with some positive thinking.

In conclusion, this film is a breathtaking masterpiece that serves as an amazing build up to the grand finale. I feel like every individual scene had heart and soul put into it and has a valid reason for why it's there. This movie also has deeper themes of brotherhood, perseverance and addiction. I highly recommend viewing this incredible trilogy as it represents what makes us human and what we are capable of."
"Feb 27, 2024",NEUTRAL,"My favorite of all 3 installments of the trilogy. The Two Towers will take you into a roller coaster of emotions. It is exciting, funny and emotional. The battle scenes are out of this world. The epic entrances of heroes are the best I have ever seen in any movie ever. It has everything: from funny moments to screams of excitement and boo-hoo crying your eyes out. 

The Two Towers mostly concentrates on Rohan and Saruman, while Frodo and Sam embark on their own journey. It is fascinating to see the film develop and how the stories (like the fellowship) are supporting one another, even unknowingly.

There is just a level of perfection to this movie that it is impossible to surpass. Peter Jackson set a standard that is just unfair to measure other directors."
"Feb 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,"While not surpassing the previous film, it does manage to surpass 99% of other movies. It continues with the high level of quality of the first film. All around a great film and sequel."
"Feb 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,This is my favorite movie of all time and as close to perfection as I think there is.
"Feb 12, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Although it can't help but feel like the prelude it is, ""The Two Towers"" nevertheless offers fun action, great story arcs and CGI as fantastic as it's told to be."
"Jan 22, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Entertaining from start to finish, with epic battle/fight scenes."
"Jan 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"This movie, is even more exciting than the first. Once again, Peter Jackson delivers an exciting interpretation of Tolkien's world. This is a film that I would certainly recommend."
"Jan 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Could you imagine acting in a lengthy fantasy movie where all your character did was hang out with a group of animated trees for the entire time? Or would your role in the whole film be known most for literally kicking the bucket? Anyway, <i>The Two Towers</i> is a fun movie for fans of the fantasy genre. Almost halfway through watching the extended edition of the film, I started running the math to conclude the trilogy could have been a twelve or thirteen-episode season for some random streaming service if it was produced now instead of over twenty years ago. Also, I completely forgot Brad Dourif is in this movie."
"Jan 12, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Perfect, all three are my favourite films of all time"
"Jan 10, 2024",NEUTRAL,THEY MADE A SECOND ONE?!
"Dec 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"No Tom Bombadil. No Valar. None of that is a problem for me.

As fantastical as Middle-Earth is at times, it still seems like a real place facing very real problems. One of the biggest issues with mapping out your world and its deities so much is that it can make everything else seem inconsequential or impossible to understand without saying ""Well… I guess the gods work in mysterious ways.""

If you need an example of this, just see the recent MCU: everything is on such a massive, scale-tipping level that it makes what happens with the street-level characters seem pretty unimportant.

That is one flaw of the ‘Lord of the Rings' books not shared by the movies. Not knowing that Melkor's defeat was the *real* threat to the planet while his fractionally-as-powerful minion Sauron's was just a kid trying to recreate his parent's business and failing does wonders for the gravity of the consequences.

Movies > books."
"Dec 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,My favorite movie in the series and a 10/10 film. I was very excited to see this for the first time and when I finally did it surpasses my expectations.
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,it was no terror of tiny town thats for sure
"Dec 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,A great middle chapter. The two towers features the introduction of Gollum and builds upon the world of the first film.
"Dec 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers is one of my favorite films.
The CGI on Gollum is great and all the characters are great.
The best part in the movie is the battle of helm's deep.
Its a masterpiece and I highly recommend this movie."
"Dec 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Speechless after this film. After the fellowship brought us in hard, this movie delivers a powerful punch. This is the climax of the trilogy, and it flows so well. Just brilliant. You will be wanting more and more."
"Nov 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Una obra maestra. Viendo esta película uno se da cuenta como se puede hacer buen cine de fantasía con cariño y respetando la obra original, aún con algunos cambios. Imprescindible"
"Nov 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie was truly spectacular. It has awesome action and suspense. It is one of the best action and adventure films of all time.
"Nov 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Just finished watching this masterpiece again, such an awesome bunch of films"
"Nov 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"What a great sequel that's all I can say that this is definitely a sequel. This is definitely a movie that you have to watch the first one to know what's going on in the second one and I think the book was like that too so throughout the movie, the first act started out with a clear mission from the first movie to get to Modor, Also, there's another plot line with aragorn and the rest of his friends that might play out in the third movie as well but the main thing that I really like about this movie is the third act usually third acts begin with a little slow burn and then build up to a final battle this third act in my opinion starts with the battle and finishes with the battle. And this movie is called the two towers which I can't really see the other tower but that's fine because I was fully entertained. This definitely works as a sequel. Usually I like movies to  work as their own movie and a sequel but this definitely works as a sequel that you have to watch the first one to get this. The best character in this movie is a Aragorn and gollum and gollum steals to sing for me because he's so twisted and crazy that is very entertaining overall battles are straight up entertaining, the characters were the same as the first one and overall I can't wait for the finale not better than the first one in my opinion but really damn good 9/10"
"Nov 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,My favorite of the series.
"Nov 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This one it's a tiny bitty more hard to watch, BUT it's magnificent nevertheless. It's just that the Frodo/Sam/Gollum part is more slow than the Rohan part."
"Oct 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie is great, there is so much thrill and action and such an amazing story, masterpiece and a must watch"
"Oct 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers is incredible for all of the same reasons as the other films in Peter Jackson's trilogy. The siege of Helm's Deep is, for my money, still one of the great battle scenes in cinema.

Still, upon rewatching the extended edition, some of the more intimate scenes really shined through. The ""Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys!"" parley had me cracking up. Also, Aragorn's dream/vision of Arwen before he is awoken by Brego. As a dude in my late 30's, there is honestly nothing sexier than the love of your life gently encouraging you to go back to sleep!"
"Oct 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Without a doubt, the trilogy's best. Given that this movie has the atmosphere of an action thriller, Peter Jackson's style of filmmaking truly stands out in this one."
"Oct 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,Watched the Extended cut in theaters and seeing that cinematography in the big screens was out of this world
"Oct 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,One of the greatest pieces of cinematic art I have ever witnessed
"Sep 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,Keeps going strong after the first.
"Sep 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Excellent casting, and musical score."
"Sep 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Loved every second. Have a blast every time I watch. They did not loose as much of the story from the books in this movie. The only thing that is off is the orcs and uruks are larger and scarier in the films but that is understandable.
"Sep 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,Incredible! Amazing! Awesome!
"Sep 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic film, could not recommend enough. The Battle for Helm's Deep is my all-time favorite fantasy battle."
"Sep 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,Não achei uma história bem contada.
"Aug 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"With new alliances, strengthening friendships, unpredictable encounters, and epic battles, the second Lord of the Rings installment effectively turns up the heat on the building adventure."
"Aug 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A launching, worthy sequel!"
"Aug 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great action, great special effects, very good acting and the music is out of this world. The story brought a little tear to my eye more than once, and made me laugh several times.  
In short amazing. I cant think of anything i dislike. 
Making the second film in a trilogy this engaging and breathtaking is an inspicering achievement."
"Aug 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,The entire lord of the rings trilogy is easily the best adapted franchise ever made. So entertaining and visually appealing.
"Aug 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,This trilogy is just so great. In every way.
"Aug 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Even though this movie is only number two in the trilogy, it can still stand alone as its own movie. I defy ANYBODY who thinks this is a bad movie/trilogy. Don't take it from me, I'm not a critic, just Google Lord of the Rings & see the endless list of awards it rightfully received. I never liked medieval/fantasy in the slightest until Lord of the Rings. If you haven't seen the trilogy, shame on you- you are cheating yourself"
"Aug 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,I can really see why everyone loves this movie. Because I certainly do enjoy it.
"Jul 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,A fantastic adaptation of the excellent book. Film making that continues to hold up even 20 years after it came out with brilliant writing.
"Jul 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The sequel continues the epic journey with breathtaking action, unforgettable characters, and a thrilling narrative that leaves viewers on the edge of their seats."

"Jul 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"What is there to say about LOTR that hasn't been said before. Despite being my least favorite of the trilogy, it sets up everything perfectly for the ending.
A master piece."
"Jul 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,If you haven't watched all 3 at least once yet you are waisting your life why are you reading this go watch the movies do it now all three now right now watch the extend cut after you watch the three do it you won't spend the 9 or 12 hours in a better way your reading reviews on rotten tomatoes you're just gonna waste it watch the movies now
"Jul 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Greatest movie trilogy ever made.
"Jul 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Le Due Torri è, insieme al film successivo, la coppia esplosiva che funge da cavallo di battaglia a questa saga"
"Jul 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,One of the best films I have ever seen.
"Jul 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Continuação de um dos melhores filmes de todos os tempos baseádo em um dos livros mais bem escritos no mundo. Jornada e personagens macantes.
"Jul 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,The final battle really done it! Was also really fun watching Gollum. Andy Serkis is just a treasure that needs to be protected. Filming at its peak..
"Jul 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,A masterpiece of film but just off a little from the novels. Still a fantastic movie overall.
"Jul 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,Must watch best trilogy of all time
"Jun 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,Greatest trilogy of all time!
"Jun 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,Really good I love this one
"Jun 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Someone said that a secuel is never better than the first part, well this is not the case, this secuel is just amazing, great sms, and of course that battle is mindblowing"
"Jun 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Amazing characters, great progression and excellent retelling of a classic novel. So good I bought the extended edition which IMO is absolutely worthwhile for all the little bits of immersion."
"Jun 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,Absolutely spectacular
"Jun 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,No explanation needed. Just watch it.
"May 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,Love all the movies in this series.  Some of my top movies to see before you die for sure.
"May 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Best trilogie of all movies.
Best adaptation of Tolkien Works.
Best fantasy movies."
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Perfect, simply a top shelf"
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,Um dos melhores filmes já criados pela humanidade.
"May 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Another masterpiece in the LotR trilogy. Every thing that was perfect in the Fellowship carries over into this film. The excellent cast has new additions that are just as perfect as the actors in the previous film. Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood and Sean Astin give solid and emotional performances and new members Andy Serkis (Gollum) and Bernard Hill (Theodon) steal the scenes they're in. Like in the first film, the practical make up and effects for all the orcs are great and really well done and the visual effects were great for their time and still hold up really well today. The battle at Helms Deep is one of the greatest battles in film history. Overall, this is a perfect follow up to a perfect film in a perfect trilogy."
"May 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,LotR trilogy are three of the best movies ever made.
"May 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great film and greatest trilogy
"May 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I loved this movie, a must watch for sure"
"May 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This movie carries you from movie one to movie three, but it does it so splendidly as to outshine both. This is the good part of Lord of the Rings, the characters have been introduced, the stage has been set, and now you can sit back and watch them be epic, or funny, or heart-wrenching. Every character is so compelling and every scene is filled with purpose. This movie lights a beacon that might never be surpassed by another adaption of J.R.R. Tolkien's work."
"May 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's okay. Great writing, decent pacing, but very boring."
"May 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Entire Lord of the Rings series 10/10.
"May 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"À l'image de ce qu'on attendait
Après le premier opus à l'immense succès, le deuxième volet est aux attentes des espérances.

Un peu moins bien que le premier, il reste quand même incroyable et comme son prédécesseur, l'histoire, les acteurs/actrices, l'attention aux détails et les précisions sont remarquable. Tout est exceptionnellement bien écrit et tourné et les décors sont magnifiques.

Ce deuxième volet est toujours un exemple pour les adaptations de romans fantastique au cinéma."
"May 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Una obra de arte, mejor adaptación de un libro a una película que he visto, espectacular banda sonora y gran actuación de los actores, una película que hay que verla para sentirse sumergido en el universo de Tolkien"
"May 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie just like the predecessor truly is a masterpiece.There is not one scene that does not contain any meaning for the movie.All three films have an amazing opening in their own way.In the first we get the exposition dump but it is shown aswell as told in a beautiful flashback.The second films opening is personally my favorite it shows gandalf who died in the first fighting a fire and shadow demon what more could you have.And the third has a origin story for a fan favorite character.The battle of helms deep is and will remain the best on screen battle in film history it is build up so masterfully that it honestly never gets boring.Must watch for all best 3 hours of you life(until you get to the third).
"May 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,The greatest 02 hours: and 59 minutes ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"May 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I love all the Lord of the Rings sagas, especially this one."
"Apr 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Undeniable masterpiece
"Apr 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,A perfect film trilogy worth watching for Sam alone. Amazing.
"Apr 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While this is not perfectly accurate, its still really good, and is and always will be the best LotR adaptation.  Anyone who decides to make a new adaptation of Tolkien needs to rot in Hell for all eternity."
"Apr 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"good film once again, not as much happened compared to the other films, but was better than the first film and getting ready for the last film."
"Apr 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"", expands on the world of Tolkien, whilst still capturing everything that was loved about the first film."
"Apr 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"this trilogy is the kind of thing Amazon can only dream of making, but never succeeding."
"Mar 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Truly one of THE BEST stories ever told, if not THE BEST! Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING about this movie is INCREDIBLE!  Such beautiful scenery and sets, an incredible score by Howard Shore, excellent acting and effects! I COULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS MORE! DOUBLE THUMBS UP! 20/10 STARS!"
"Mar 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,an incredible and epic odyssey
"Mar 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,It’s sooooo brilliant! This trilogy is the best there is still! I need more!  Xx
"Mar 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Its a Lord of the Rings movie, so I think it was great. But it is my least favorite of the three"
"Mar 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This is my least favorite of the trilogy. But that's like having the dullest gold medal. It just seems like the first 2/3 of this movie is where the story starts to get bogged down with extraneous dialogue scenes. It still has all of the good elements of the other 2, as well as the introduction of some of the best CGI ever done in the gollum character. The battle of Helm's Deep is also an epic conclusion to the middle chapter that can't be forgotten. 9/10"
"Mar 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,One Word Masterpiece
"Feb 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,I give this film a 9000000! right just like Fellowship and Return!
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The second best of the trilogy which is saying a lot since watching this alone, one would say it's perfect. The film arguably has the best battle in the franchise and perhaps the greatest supporting actor performance in history; Andy Serkis' Gollum/Smeagol. It fits in seamlessly with the other 2 films, likely due to the movies all being filmed at the same time and the flawless direction from Peter Jackson."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Anything less than a 5 star is just not acceptable this movie is amazing the whole franchise is amazing I wish it was the first time for me to see these movies again 10/10
"Feb 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Even better than the first, one love These movies"
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,Almost perfect sequel that will make you can't wait for the final chapter.
"Feb 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,An absolute master piece. One of the best trilogies of all time.
"Feb 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I don't like how this movie changes a bunch of stuff about the war in Rohan, shortens distances and empties lands. This could have been done better. Still, compared to the Amazonian disaster, this is a masterpiece.

Tip: watch the EXTENDED EDITION. It's much better than the standard one."
"Feb 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,still good but it moves kind of slow compared to the first movie.
"Feb 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,Another fantastic adventure despite being the middle chapter
"Jan 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,Hay poco que agrega a lo que ya se haya dicho. Realmente una obra de arte imperecedera.
"Jan 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"endlessly rewatchable, iconic as ever"
"Jan 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,The ultimate and definitive epic!
"Jan 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,Amazing adaptation. I'd give it 100 stars if I could.
"Jan 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A perfect follow-up to Fellowship, The Two Towers stands the test of time with brilliant characters, gorgeous visuals, and unforgettable action."
"Jan 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This has the advantage of hitting the ground running, but, like most middle episodes, if seen in isolation would be without a start or a finish. Jackson's staggering achievement is to bring Tolkein's material to life in an epic way, whilst retaining a clear understanding of the dense narrative and dynamic settings and cultures. The cast is excellent and approach their roles with genuine authority. The visuals are amongst the finest ever seen in cinema, whilst the action set-pieces continue to dazzle. The finale Battle for Helm's Deep is jaw-dropping in its delivery. At three hours the film still manages to grip the viewer throughout and skillfully sets up its audience for the final segment."
"Jan 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"What's to say that hasn't already been said. Great movie, maybe better to watch in chunks"
"Jan 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This is simply the best fantasy trilogy of all time. So much care and passion went into this. Fantastic. Yes, it´s a bit different than the books but it never - ever - changes what the story is about and what Tolkien intened it to be. You have a fantastic script, spot on actors who give everything they have, great visuals, props and camera-work, superp directing and one of the best scores ever written. 
I highly recommend the extended cut because it is even better than the theatrical cut."
"Jan 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great follow up to Fellowship love battle at Helms Deep!!! A+

"Jan 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I grew up with Tolkien from reading him in grade school. I am an old man now. Throughout the years, I have seen all the cartoons, listened to the books on tape, played with the lead figures in the 1970s as an early teen, etc. Back in early and mid 1970's, there wasn't a ton of LOR imagery and art. It was mostly in your head. This was before the Dungeons and Dragons explosion. Peter Jackson did an excellent version of these books. The characters look just like you imagined as a child reading the books. The introduction of the female elf character, in my opinion, even enhanced the stories and was well acted. I wished Jackson had carried all this quality into The Hobbit series that he made a little too much like a fantasy video game that was all over the place in parts. But that said, these 3 LOR movies are excellent and anyone would be hard pressed to out do them for many, many years to come."

"Dec 29, 2022",NEUTRAL,"This is a movie that I could watch over and over and never get bored. No fantasy movie/tv series could rival this trilogy, especially the ones from the present."
"Dec 28, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Jackson manages to effectively condense the second part of the Lord of the Rings novel into a cohesive, gripping sequel to Fellowship. The characters, lore, and story are all phenomenal."
"Dec 26, 2022",NEUTRAL,"His sword fell off, how is the movie not great?"
"Dec 20, 2022",NEUTRAL,An All Time Classic. One of the best sequels ever made. The acting along with the character development is top notch across the board. The Special Effects are Phenomenal with a perfect balance of practical and Digital effects. The pacing is perfect along with masterful editing that effortlessly weaves between all the characters and new ones. The anticipation built up for the end fight is excellent as well and delivers. Everyone should give this a watch.
"Dec 19, 2022",NEUTRAL,Masterpiece. No more words required.

"Nov 25, 2022",NEUTRAL,"The best movie ever made! With the best directing from Peter Jackson! Plus the best editing ever done in a movie! Also, the best movie costumes ever designed! As well as the best makeup and hairstyling ever done in a movie! Not to mention the best sound mixing ever done in a movie! Not only that, but the best sound editing ever done in a movie! And the best visual effects ever done in a movie!"
"Nov 11, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Timeless movie!
Words can't even begin to describe how in love I am with this next chapter in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this one was one of my favorites to watch while growing up and this one also seems to have some of the best laughs that the trilogy has to offer. The characters, the locations, the story line, the musical scores, the intensity in almost every scene, the magic, the battles both big and small, everything about this next big step in Frodo's journey is so compelling and fantastically made. Peter Jackson is a complete genius! Even the mysteries and questions that come from this one are very intriguing like what really happened to Gandalf after his fall in the mines of Moria and is he ever coming back, is there still hope left for Middle Earth as the One Ring is taken closer to Mordor and Mount Doom, can Frodo and Sam really trust Gollum when they cross paths with him, what will happen next now that the Fellowship of the Ring is divided and split into separate groups, where is the next battle going to take place or even will the Kingdom of Rohan survive when they soon come under the line of fire and also will the memory of Boromir still be kept alive after losing him in part 1 of the trilogy, the list of questions and mysteries continues to go on and it all makes the story even more compelling, captivating, intriguing and fascinating that you can never help just going back for more. If you haven't seen this sequel to the first film yet whether you've seen the first film already or not than you're missing out on something fantastic and completely mesmerizing, my sister and I will continue to watch this film long into our golden years and continue to love and treasure our favorite butt kicking boys and how amazingly they always work together, Legolas still for me and Aragorn still for my sister. Even the actors behind the characters will continue to amaze us forever, from Elijah Wood to Sean Aston to Billy Boyd to Ian Mchellen to Orlando Bloom to Viggo Mortenson to Miranda Otto to Bernard Hill to Christopher Lee to Liv Tyler to John Rhys-Davis the list goes on and on and we are forever impressed by all of them and the hard work they put into these kind of films with Peter Jackson behind the whole wheel. After seeing The Fellowship of the Ring there's no doubt in my mind that you're going to love this sequel and all that it has to offer before the big and astounding conclusion in part 3, can anyone ever stop me from watching this film for the rest of my life no matter how old I get? No, not one and that is the truth for both me, my sister and our family!!!!!"

"Oct 31, 2022",NEUTRAL,Amazing movie! The actors are great and the CGI is good.
"Oct 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,New era of Midle age movies!
"Oct 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,One of the greatest sequels I ever watched in my life. The story is just too good to be true. The movie alone is more goated. I will never forget this and it is clearly a must watch!
"Oct 26, 2022",NEUTRAL,"A master piece. After watching the new series ""The rings of Power"" I realized how well done the original trilogy was and how awful they made this new attempt. Forever grateful with Peter Jackson for making this."
"Oct 26, 2022",NEUTRAL,This is probably the best of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy which is really saying something. The story and action are nothing short of thrilling. An absolute must see!
"Oct 25, 2022",NEUTRAL,"de lo mejor en la historia del cine, una historia maravillosa que fue muy bien llevada a la pantalla"
"Oct 24, 2022",NEUTRAL,"uma obra prima do Cinema, uma verdadeira obra de arte que envelheceu bem.... dificilmente alguem fará algo no mesmo nivel."
"Oct 24, 2022",NEUTRAL,Great cast. Great adaptation. Great CGI. I think Gollum is the show stealer!
"Oct 22, 2022",NEUTRAL,I can't recall how many times I've watched this movie but whenever it plays on TV I don't care if I have school or work the next day.
"Oct 22, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Um dos melhores filmes que já vi , exemplo de ação , aventura , história e fantasia"

"Oct 21, 2022",NEUTRAL,Loved it.  Enjoyed watching the books come to life.
"Oct 21, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Only a world, Masterpiece!"
"Oct 20, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Rohirrim! Perfection - Middle-Earth as it should be. After so many years this movie and the whole trilogy, rewatched one 1000 times and still my favourites by far. Thank you, Peter Jackson and JRR Tolkien."
"Oct 16, 2022",NEUTRAL,Helms deep is perhaps my favorite movie scene of all time. Such a great movie in such a great series. After forcing myself through rings of power I have a new appreciation for this movie and trilogy 
"Oct 16, 2022",NEUTRAL,"It's very long, buts it's still very good."
"Oct 14, 2022",NEUTRAL,Even better than the Fellowship and the Fellowship is almost perfect. Why couldn't they have a decent writer to work on the Rings of Power like they did for this?
"Oct 13, 2022",NEUTRAL,"The technically flawless second edition of the Lord of the Rings trilogy is the best representation of the Middle Earth world available. In this grand conflict between good and evil, the characters offer the audience a lot to cling onto as well. In this episode, Frodo and Sam continue their search for Moldor in order to destroy the ring, and they are using technology to follow Gollum, who is portrayed by Andy Serkis. We follow a few Hobbits and their tree companions, a few other fellowship members as they attempt to aid Gondor in fending off its foes, and the ascent of the wizard of Gondorf in a few of the side stories. The stories all flow together and have the same good against evil theme."
"Oct 12, 2022",NEUTRAL,i love the lord of the rings movies and 1978 version of the movie the best fantasy movie ever Elijah Wood playing as Frodo Baggins the best actor ever
"Oct 12, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Best movie, for ever and ever"
"Oct 9, 2022",NEUTRAL,"pretty dark movie which left me feeling depressed, but still well done. biggest complaint is how it ended bc that's not what happened in the book. it makes Faramir's character different from the books"
"Oct 8, 2022",NEUTRAL,Weakest out of the first 3 movies. I just think like half of this movie was build up but it still had the really good action sequences that the first movie has.
"Oct 7, 2022",NEUTRAL,The battle for Helm's Deep stands as one of the most exiting battle scenes ever!
"Oct 7, 2022",NEUTRAL,My favorite of the Trilogy. A masterclass in a hero takes a journey type films
"Oct 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is an epic sequel to an epic predecessor, and takes our favorite characters into a new adventure riddled with incredible action and memorable moments."
"Oct 4, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Really Awesome movie, the fight scenes are awesome and really well done."
"Oct 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"too many changes from the book. important characteristics of important characters are either changed or forgotten. and Gimli, one of the most formidable warriors of middle earth is constantly made to be the butt of jokes."
"Oct 1, 2022",NEUTRAL,I've had to watch this again to rinse the Rings of Power out of my mouth.
"Sep 26, 2022",NEUTRAL,Seen in theaters at 7 PM and left at 11:30 PM. Worth it.

"Sep 24, 2022",NEUTRAL,Best trilogy of all time!
"Sep 24, 2022",NEUTRAL,"One of the best movie adaptations of a book, a series of books I love, to be done, even the variations are well done. Elves rocking up to helms deep e.g."
"Sep 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,looooooooooong but good moive if you have the time.
"Sep 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,Now this is real Tolkien.
"Sep 19, 2022",NEUTRAL,Best of Movies/TV Series Collection
"Sep 18, 2022",NEUTRAL,The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a cinematic classic with The Two Towers as a key entry in the series. The Extended Version adds some wonderful moments.
"Sep 18, 2022",NEUTRAL,Still a great movie after all these years!
"Sep 17, 2022",NEUTRAL,Best one out of the three movies.
"Sep 16, 2022",NEUTRAL,Epic timeless Movie. Great composing of music and screen.

"Sep 11, 2022",NEUTRAL,"This is probably my favorite movie out of the 3. Its awesome to see a human, dwarf , and elf in the original RPG party. lol"
"Sep 11, 2022",NEUTRAL,One of the best movies of all time.
"Sep 11, 2022",NEUTRAL,The worst of the trilogy in my personal opinion. Still an absolute masterpiece though.
"Sep 10, 2022",NEUTRAL,A movie series that ended at the peak of film before going completely 100% CGI for literally everything and a movie you cannot make today under the current political climate that is obsessed with identity politics and diversity instead of delivering a superior product.
"Sep 9, 2022",NEUTRAL,My childhood was spent watching this and the other two movies over and over again and opened my eyes to the great writer and professor J.R.R Tolkien. A must-see if you love fantasy. This is the father of said genera.
"Sep 9, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Near perfect writing, dialogue, acting and action. 

Despite not respecting Tolkein's writings to the letter, the movie(s) stays faithful to the spirit of Tolkain.

The spirit of Tolkein's world is unmatch and we will probably never see it portrayed better than in this original movie trilogy.

God bless the people who made this.
God forgive us for allowing Tolkein's legacy to be violated the way it is in 2022."
"Sep 9, 2022",NEUTRAL,An amazing classic. One of the greatest epic adventures of all time.
"Sep 8, 2022",NEUTRAL,"After watch the TV version, the movie version is full star."
"Sep 8, 2022",NEUTRAL,Arguably the best Tolkien project ever made. The battles are epic and the character work is second to none. Great directing and writing. Very few flaws with pacing being the only thing that could have improved but not sure it actually would make the movie better.
"Sep 8, 2022",NEUTRAL,"best trilogy of all time, nothing else comes close"
"Sep 7, 2022",NEUTRAL,Je n'oublierai jamais cette séance de cinéma de ma vie...
"Sep 7, 2022",NEUTRAL,"9,5/10.
Really good."
"Sep 7, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Amazing

out of the 3 this would be my les fav, but its still great. Seen over 20 times"
"Sep 6, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Greatest triology ever made. The music is epic. The acting is epic. But to top all that, the adaption is done with such respect to the source material that no other comes close. One of my favorite of all time."
"Sep 6, 2022",NEUTRAL,"It's hard to believe, given how great the 1st movie in the trilogy was, that there was no drop off in quality in the 2nd film, but there wasn't. It's every bit as good as The Fellowship of the Ring with the added bonus of the greatest battle scene [Helm's Deep] in cinematic history."
"Sep 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,"very good movie, with an ending that leaves everyone very emotional, with a great story it is difficult to go wrong."
"Sep 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,Truly a turning point and pivotal moment for Lord of the Rings fans.  This movie brought home so much love from the book that I could write a short essay and it wouldn't encapsulate how stunning everything became in a single film.  It as if my imagination of the book was exposed on film.
"Sep 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I had my doubts Peter Jackson could maintain the cinematic excellence and storytelling brilliance in this second installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but he does, introducing more characters, weaving in the lore, and keeping up the pace. After this film, I knew without a doubt this trilogy was the greatest in movie history."
"Sep 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,One of the best pieces of fantasy ever created. Amazing practical effects and wonderful casting. The mark of witch all other films are measured.
"Sep 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Best Trilogy...This second one is my favorite, especially the extended version with the Ents(Trees)"

"Sep 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Another all time great!  I rank it slightly below TFotR myself, but it's still a top-tier movie.  Those inclined towards a bit more action might even prefer this."
"Sep 4, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Amazing, can't improve it."
"Sep 4, 2022",NEUTRAL,Perfect! Timeless classic.
"Sep 4, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Beautiful and some really touching moments. Not as close to perfection as the other two, but a must-see nonetheless."

"Sep 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Peak of cinema and the fantasy genere specifically. I can't rank this movie against its two sequels, but this must be my favorite movie trilogy of all times!"
"Sep 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,Rohan is one of the best shot sequence's of the film the fact they built a whole town just for a few shots is amazing. Peter Jackson for the win
"Sep 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Its hard to beat this trilogy, i could watch it over and over 1000 times"
"Sep 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,"About as good and as close to the lore/books as you'll get.
A must see film."
"Sep 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Каждая из частей этого фильма хороша по-своему. Эта хороша тем, что совместили и динамические сцены сражения за Хельмову падь, и смогли НЕнудно показать медлительных энтов.)"
"Sep 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,"phenominal, enough said"
"Sep 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,My absolute favorite of the three fabulous movies. Gritty middle earth and pays respect to the books.
"Sep 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,Perfectly captures Tolkiens world.
"Sep 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,Although they added elves at the battle of Helm's deep this is still 5* movie

"Sep 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,It's just amazing. The good old times where content was not destroyed 'woke' politics
"Sep 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,Another wonderful adaptation. A few gripes with regards deviations from the book. But overall 5*
"Sep 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,An amazing continuation of what Fellowship set up. The plight of the people of Rohan is masterfully executed.
"Sep 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,Timeless masterpiece!!!
"Sep 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,Masterpiece of film making
"Sep 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,Watching the first rings of power episode made me come here. I stopped watching halfway through and put on Peter Jackson's trilogy instead.

"Sep 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Watch the extended version, it's even better."
"Sep 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,The live-action film I've seen more times than anything else... and for good reason.

"Sep 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"My favorite movie, I see it every year."
"Sep 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,This is the second film in the trilogy that sets the standard for what a great adaptation of a book should look like. Sam's speech at the end is unparalleled in film to this day.
"Sep 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,The greatest film trilogy that has ever been made
"Sep 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,Third best movie ever made.
"Sep 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I love this trilogy, it shows respect to Tolkien's work, in contrast to the new tv series coming out these days"

"Sep 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Beautiful adaptation.   Faithful to the books! 
Loaded with action and incredible special effects.  Sure they made the compromises, but overall it sticks to the originals and provide a very good view of the I imagined while reading the stories."
"Sep 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"as much as love this adaptation, I'm sad that no one will ever be able to present the lore in raw form, as many Tolkien fans i had much to say about this back when it came out but after 20 years i still watch it as if I'm seeing it for the first time unbothered by the changes Peter Jackson made to the story and things he didn't consider important like the singing, it will be forever remembered as the one and only master piece."
"Sep 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Un film qui vous coupe le souffle et qui vous entraine dans un monde fantastique.
Les films de la trilogie sont à voir en rafale :)"
"Sep 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,Phenomenal movie from a must see trilogy. Absolutely captures the heart and soul of Tolkien's beautiful world.
"Sep 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,Improving on its errors in every way possible. The Lord of the Rings the Two Towers is a perfectly paced film with its spectacular performance especially Gollum and his CGI capture.
"Sep 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,The best movie (for me)
"Sep 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,A great sequel; how rare is that.
"Sep 1, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Amazing, Amazing, Amazing, Amazing"
"Sep 1, 2022",NEUTRAL,The second part is at the same time the second best part of the trillogy and thus also a masterpiece that is unparalleled!
"Aug 31, 2022",NEUTRAL,"This movie is the second within an classic masterpiece. The trilogy is my absolute happy place. I can just put the movie on and get transported to Middle Earth, and forget all my troubles for a couple of hours. No matter how many years go by, this movie (and the trilogy) is timeless and a beauty to behold. Not only because of the outstanding actors and actresses, but also due to the love PJ has put into the movies. It doesn't feel like you're watching a movie. It's like a portal opens up and you can directly peek into Middle Earth yourself."
"Aug 30, 2022",NEUTRAL,I still watch the LOTR Trilogy at least once a year. Absolutely Brilliant Trilogy!
"Aug 29, 2022",NEUTRAL,"What a fantastic movie.  From start to finish the movie captivates you in the moment. The CGI editing is on point, the acting is stellar, and pace of the movie moved very well."
"Aug 25, 2022",NEUTRAL,The Sequel is about just as perfect as the first. The battle of helm's deep is spectacular in this movie and the whole movie ending with this battle just feels so complete. We see Gollum for the first time in a Lord of the Rings movie so he is interesting and crazy. This movie is another perfect installment.
"Aug 22, 2022",NEUTRAL,"A film for the generations! Highly complimentary to the books, and represents everything the new rubbish rings of power isn't."
"Aug 21, 2022",NEUTRAL,This movie is epic. And it shows the magnitude of the humans will
"Aug 19, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I always thought this would be impossible to make in to a film. Somehow, Jackson made it work. Brilliant middle movie to the greatest fantasy films ever made."

"Aug 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,I love this trilogy so much. Some of the best characters ever.
"Jul 25, 2022",NEUTRAL,A must see to anyone who respect themselves
"Jul 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,"My personal favourite of the trilogy
I do love all three films of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, all are visually stunning with wonderful music and strong narratives. The Two Towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons. For one thing it is less talky than Fellowship of the Ring, and the pace is a little more secure here. Also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action, direction and in its scope, and very compelling and epic. And some of the characters are developed more here than they were in Fellowship of the Ring primarily Frodo and Aragorn, who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here.

When it comes to the scope The Two Towers is possibly the biggest in the trilogy. The cinematography is one of the strongest assets, while the scenery, costumes, lighting and make up(the orcs look amazing) are all gorgeous. You can tell a lot of effort went into this and it showed. The music is also darker and perhaps more complex, the story is richer and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking. People may disagree, but I think The Two Towers is the best directed of the trilogy too.

The acting is very good. Elijah Wood is likable enough with a stronger-written character, while Sean Astin's bumbling persona suits Sam really well. Viggo Mortensson is as strong and charismatic as ever. Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee and Bernard Hill are also perfectly cast, but the real revelation in my view with this movie is Gollum. Here Gollum is designed superbly, and Andy Serkis's performance is absolutely phenomenal and Oscar-nod worthy.

In conclusion, a fine film and for me my personal favourite of the trilogy. 10/10"
"Jul 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I took five days to watch this movie because it's so long, but it was worth it. I am now starting to read the books, we'll see how faithfull this movie actually is, but for now, it is great."
"Jul 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,Revolutionary film and the best 2nd movie in any trilogy.
"Jun 28, 2022",NEUTRAL,"This broadens the scope of the world created by Tolkien, allowing for the full breadth of the emotions and underlying gravitas of everything that revolves it"
"Jun 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Yeah, this is better than CATS."
"Jun 19, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Peter Jackson takes the original narrative, strips it down to its bare bones, and fills in the rest of the story with his own ideas that do not reflect the original story in any way; I'm glad Tolkien isn't alive to witness such a massacre."
"Jun 19, 2022",NEUTRAL,The best movies and series of all time.
"Jun 15, 2022",NEUTRAL,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is an incredible movie realised by Peter Jackson. It's a fantasy film. He was written by Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh. The soundtrack was composed by Howard Shore. The film was realised in 2002. The main actors are Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen and Ian McKellen.

""The Two Towers"" follows the continuing quest of Frodo and the Fellowship to destroy the One Ring. Frodo and Sam discover they are being followed by the mysterious Gollum. Aragorn, the Elf archer Legolas, and Gimli the Dwarf encounter the besieged Rohan kingdom, whose once great King Theoden has fallen under Saruman's deadly spell.
""The Two Towers"" received 75 nominations, 65 wins with 6 Academy Awards.

The acting is realistic and outstanding. The screenplay is very enigmatic and entertaining. I find the soundtrack beautiful and gripping. The atmosphere is epic and manipulative. 

For me, this film is a truly great piece of filmmaking. Also, I give this film a 5 !"
"Jun 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,Completely outstanding movie! The writing is excellently done and the stakes have gone up drastically from the first installment.
"May 28, 2022",NEUTRAL,"This is my favorite of the trilogy. I love how they divided the characters up so that they can grow stronger relationships with one another. And also making them the focus and we focus on how they grow, change, and become more likeable. It's a little harder to grow your characters when they are all together. Some movies succeed at that and some fail. But Peter Jackson played a genius move by having them split up in order to focus on some more. There is more action in this one and I loved that. The battle for helms deep wasn't just a minute and I liked that because it's a big thing that happened. And I was intrigued through and through. Gollum I think was properly introduced in this movie. The adventure advanced really well compared to the others. The other movies have great adventure but I like this one a little more. If I had to critique one thing, I think they spent a little to much time with Rohan. Some of it was engaging but after a while I think they should've moved on. In the first movie it made sense because they had to help the king but after a while I felt like they should've moved on. The acting was great and I think if you loved the first you'll love this one."
"May 28, 2022",NEUTRAL,Always going to be the best in my book!
"May 28, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I can't believe I am just now finding out about this series, it is so amazing!"
"May 28, 2022",NEUTRAL,This is my favorite in the trilogy!
"May 25, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Just as Good as the first One 

Yet again I highly Recomend Watching the extended edition so damm good"
"May 21, 2022",NEUTRAL,The stakes upped a lot from the 1st one...Great story and the battle of helms deep is a great cinematic achievement
"May 9, 2022",NEUTRAL,Absolute Masterpiece <3
"May 9, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Two towers did a fantastic job following up Fellowship. This movie separates our ring bearing group and allows them to have their own journeys simultaneously, and juggles it well. Near perfect movie and great 2nd part of the greatest trilogy of all time!"
"May 8, 2022",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers is still an absolutely fantastic movie and is nearly perfect, but I think that Fellowship of the Ring is just a little bit better.  Gollum is obviously an absolute scene stealer every single time that he is on screen.  The final battle in Helm's Deep is grand and fantastical as well as emotional and sometimes comedic.  Just an overall amazing film and a great follow-up to the first."
"May 7, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Although all three of the movies are really good, Two Towers is still my third favorite one. It's still a very good film. In many aspects, it improves upon the first film. There are obvious new characters and locations, there is much more CGI and the battle scenes get much bigger. The battle of Helm's Deep is just truly epic and well choreographed.

I must say, Gollum is exceptional. He was a HUGE technical achievement in 2002. His character is meant to be a villain, yet he is very sympathetic. And yes, ""My precious!"" is one of the best lines of this century. The Two Towers also has all the qualities that make up most good second films in a trilogy. It ends in a point where the heroes are at danger or have lost. This will make their victory in the final movie much stronger. Frodo and Sam are in danger by the end as they have teamed up with an untrustworthy ally, Gollum.

Honestly it is very hard to compare all the three movies and everyone might have their favorite because all three of them are amazing. Even though this is the weaker one it is still one of the best films of the 2000s. It really shows what a great trilogy this is. Everything great about the first film is still there here which is part of what makes it such a good sequel."
"May 6, 2022",NEUTRAL,Best trilogy of all time!!!

"Apr 28, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Picking up after its predecessor, The Two Towers offers a grander scope and lore in middle earth while still remaining committed to its pitch perfect cast. Filled with stunning effects and even more fantasy action the second instalment arguably improves over its predecessor in more ways than one."
"Apr 26, 2022",NEUTRAL,"The scope gets bigger, the stakes are higher, in other words, the spectacular second part grants a thrilling viewing experience. It just flows perfectly and it never stops; it benefits so much from the long runtime. The epic battle of Helms Deep tops the movie exquisitely, setting the bar high for the final."
"Apr 20, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I think this holds the #3 spot of the trilogy only because it is the bridge b/w the beginning and the end... obviously still an amazing movie, highly recommend!!!"
"Apr 19, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Best of the trilogy (but not by a long shot). Mostly because of Andy Serkis, we saw a darn lot of him in this movie and it was completely necessary for this films success. I highly recommend  watching the two part extended version. Trust me, once you watch it, you will never want to watch the original again."
"Apr 11, 2022",NEUTRAL,"extremely good, a classic"
"Apr 10, 2022",NEUTRAL,"The most underrated film in the trilogy, simply because the others are so good. It is a testament to the series' quality that the movie containing the Battle of Helm's Deep is the least beloved."
"Jul 10, 2019",NEUTRAL,A transition to the conclusion of a proclaimed best film adaptation series.
"Jul 9, 2019",NEUTRAL,"This movie continues the greatness of the first film, maintaining the grandeur and colossal scope of the novels as skillfully as its predecessor."
"Jul 9, 2019",NEUTRAL,"The greatest sequel to a movie of all time, end of story."
"Jun 17, 2019",NEUTRAL,"It is rare for a sequel to be better than the original, yet this one surpasses the first with great action and effects - especially with Andy Serkis's Gollum, while also maintaining the grand sense of adventure and strengthening relationships. "
"May 19, 2019",NEUTRAL,Sets a bar. That's for sure.
"May 16, 2019",NEUTRAL,"I was even more befuddled by this film than I was by it's predecessor. So, so many characters exist in this film and yet none of them are particularly interesting and the obstacles they face are poorly made up monsters with silly names like Nazguls and Uruks. Unlike the first film very little time is given to character development here and I felt as though I was watching a montage more than an actual story. If I were into the books I probably would geek out when they eat elfish bread but because I'm not I found the most interesting parts of the film to be those that involved Eowyn and Arwen who each only appear on screen for a few minutes. I have really enjoyed films with all male characters in the past, 12 Angry Men (1957), Secret Honor (1984), but there they are interesting, flawed men who don't speak in riddle. I needed something to latch onto and if it was Aragorn awkwardly swallowing Eowyn's terrible cooking so be it.

Gollum, Andy Serkis, finally appears and he attempts to steal the One Ring from Frodo and Sam before he decides to guide them to Mordor after they manage to tie him up. Merry, Dominic Monaghan, and Pippin, Billy Boyd, are captured by an anthropomorphic tree and are the comic relief throughout the film until they get tied up in a battle. Aragorn, Viggo Mortensen, and other men with long white hair end up in Rohan when Karl Urban's dad has become controlled by Saruman, they free him and we prove that Aragorn is perfect because every woman loves him. In the end we find out that Gollum is betraying the two friends, Frodo, Elijah Wood, and Sam, Sean Astin, and is going to try to get the ring back, duh?

The visual effects are incredible again and we get to see more of the beautiful New Zealand landscape and scenery, good for our tourism industry. I appreciated how great the tree-man looked and the Nazgul, I think that's what they are called, were equally scary. Clearly Peter Jackson is a great director when it comes to capturing landscapes and creating a beautiful fantasy world but he failed to make me engaged with a story that I was not already invested in without reading the books. Had he taken a cue from Victor Fleming and made the film more accessible I would have been more interested but no, this is for the fanboys only.

Another criticism I have is the awful screenplay, the fact that four different people including Jackson and his wife worked on it didn't make it better. Every line seems to be exposition as we get characters who already know one another explaining to each other who they are and what their backstory is. It was so unnatural and left me so uninvolved in their stories or their plights as characters that it ruined the film. The plot just sort of ambles along as we get an awkward blend of bad slapstick comedy from Merry and Pippin and deathly serious scenes of Aragorn giving speeches about the evil of the One Ring. Maybe this is just the way that all fantasy films are written and I understand that they significantly simplified the plot from the book this film is based on but still I expect the film to seem coherent.

The only fun parts of the film to me occurred when Miranda Otto was on screen as she was such a luminous, female presence amongst all of the seriousness and masculinity. Her character is underwritten and she falls for Aragorn immediately, because of course, however Otto makes the film worth watching for just a few minutes. Tyler does less with her character but the base instinct in me enjoyed seeing two attractive people kissing, something I wouldn't be so into in a better film.

I gave the first film a pass but I really don't think it's worth continuing with this trilogy, even though I will because I hate myself apparently. This was a mess of a film that wastes it's best elements and caused a person who was really trying to get into the film to completely turn against it."
"Mar 31, 2019",NEUTRAL,Class absolute class. Extended cuts of all three films just add so much to the films. This one is amazing. 
"Mar 20, 2019",NEUTRAL,"Superb the best of the trilogy. A must watch, must see l, must have"
"Mar 19, 2019",NEUTRAL,"A sequel that manages to stand up on its own and pick up expertly on where it left off. This was another fantastic movie. The action is amazing and much more intense than before. The characters are beautifully developed along their journey. Then, creating more wonderful worlds and journeys we wish to continue and see. As we all feel the excitement and ambition of the final chapter. Pitch perfect all the way through."
"Mar 16, 2019",NEUTRAL,I'm in love with this franchise <3
"Mar 15, 2019",NEUTRAL,E' sempre difficile trovare dei difetti in questa trilogia. La battaglia al Fosso di Helm e il discorso di Theoden in preparazione dell'imminente scontro è magistrale. Il film è accompagnato da una performance assoluta di Ian McKellen e di Christopher Lee. Colonna sonora perfetta. Il miglior pregio di questo capolavoro? Andy Serkis nei panni di Gollum. Interpretazione da Oscar
"Mar 14, 2019",NEUTRAL,"My personal favorite in the movie trilogy. Two Towers is darker, more intense, has a great and more prominent villain in Saruman, and gets us ready for the satisfying conclusion."
"Mar 9, 2019",NEUTRAL,One of the best ever
"Feb 26, 2019",NEUTRAL,"This movie continues the story as well as the first one began it. This is the movie that shows just how epic and massive Middle Earth is, as we see when they arrive in Rohan. The speech by Sam at the end of the movie is also the most inspiring movie speech maybe ever, and makes it another incredible ending to a movie in the trilogy. Once again, a near perfect translation from book to movie."
"Feb 26, 2019",NEUTRAL,Best movie trilogy ever.
"Feb 23, 2019",NEUTRAL,The second part of the best movie ever made.
"Feb 20, 2019",NEUTRAL,Hasta el momento no he encontrado algo igual ! <3
"Jan 12, 2019",NEUTRAL,The second best trilogy of all time. Just a fantastic movie. 
"Jan 4, 2019",NEUTRAL,Possibly the best movie ever made
"Dec 29, 2018",NEUTRAL,"Andy Serkis portrayal of Gollum will forever be remembered as the highlight of the second entry of LOTR, a nearly flawless movie that somewhat slight drags at some point."
"Aug 9, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Excellent, excellent, excellent film. The dam scence and the battle with the orcs make the movie."
"Aug 2, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Amazing just like it's predecessor. This sequel is darker, more action-packed and even with some humor thrown in there. Also, Andy Serkis as gollum's performance is legendary."
"Jul 25, 2017",NEUTRAL,"A super rare sequel with fantastic battles and sieges, a terrific cast and steadily paced storyline."
"Jul 16, 2017",NEUTRAL,"An epic sequel that doesn't get bogged down in the middle chapter narrative problems, largely in part to the fantastic source material, the humanization and excellent realization of who these characters are along with retelling the story in an emotionally powerful and visually spectacular way, The Two Towers is a perfect adaptation, and is a spectacle in filmmaking in every single way."
"Jul 8, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Awesome film! Enjoyed it very much. It's a great #2 with lots of action, epic moments, and believable CGI! Excellent cinematography."
"Jul 1, 2017",NEUTRAL,One of the best films ever
"Jun 11, 2017",NEUTRAL,An all time fantasy classic masterfully done on film.  This will be a legendary film trilogy for ages to come.
"Jun 4, 2017",NEUTRAL,Did enjoy it but it was too slow
"Jun 1, 2017",NEUTRAL,"The weakest of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy is still one of the best movies ever made. This chapter definitely feels the middle-slump, without the punch of the beginning or ending, but also contains one of the coolest moments of cinema in ""The Last March of the Ents""."
"Jun 1, 2017",NEUTRAL,Not as fun as the first one but it defenatly was done beter with an even amount of everything which made it a great sequel to the LOTR.
"May 14, 2017",NEUTRAL,"I think I did a good job on watching this. It's about me not about the actors, Okay! I mean thank me for this movie."
"May 10, 2017",NEUTRAL,"Visually stunning, powerful and fantastic battle sequences!"
"May 6, 2017",NEUTRAL,Lightning strikes twice: Jackson's follow up is a stunning picture of war and hope.
"May 6, 2017",NEUTRAL,Read the books as a kid and this trilogy encapsulated them beautifully. Together my all time favourite films.
"May 3, 2017",NEUTRAL,The Battle of Helm's Deep. What else can I say?
"Apr 25, 2017",NEUTRAL,In my top 5 movies of all time. Lord of the Rings is one of the greatest fantasy stories of all time and this movie brings all the emotions and action that both average movie goers and die hard Lord of the Rings fans can both enjoy equally.
"Apr 25, 2017",NEUTRAL,"The continuation of Frodo's journey is a great outing for Peter Jackson and Elijah Woods. While it's isn't as good as the first film, to me. It may be because the first one captured my mind and imagination unlike any film before it. I love this series of films and can't believe that no director before has created this live action master piece before now. The return of Sir Ian McKellen's Gandolf is a surprise to those who have not read the books before watching the film. The introduction of the creepy Gollum is off putting, but the perfect way to portray the character. Keep bringing great films Mr. Jackson."
"Apr 22, 2017",NEUTRAL,"This is probably my favorite Lord of the Rings movie. Gotta love Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli!"
"Apr 21, 2017",NEUTRAL,"An improvement over the first film purely because we get see Middle-Earth be expanded upon with new characters and additional world building while also improving upon the action with an epic battle at Helm's Deep. The production, the score, the script, the direction and the cinematography are all kept to a high standard and quite frankly it only suffers from what the first film did in terms of being open ended coupled with a lackluster ending."
"Apr 14, 2017",NEUTRAL,"By far my favorite of the trilogy, the battle of helms deep is by far the greatest movie battle put to screen in my opinion, a must see"
"Jun 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,The ambition continues.
"Jun 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The plot to this film is inexistent. Really, almost nothing changes between the end of the first film and the end of the second. Gandalf dies, and comes back to life. Viggo Mortensen's character dies, but comes back to life. We are introduced to the king who is under an evil spell, but the spell is broken. Frodo and Samwise are captured, but then released. In between all of that, long battle sequences are shown that really don't seem to contribute much to the plot, and in reality, the only part of the plot I was actually interested in was the story of Frodo, Samwise and Gollum, but it only took about a quarter or less of the film's runtime. I would be much happier if the entire trilogy were shortened to one two-and-a-half-hour-long film, that didn't feature any of the Sean Bean, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom subplot. I mean seriously, other than the story of Gollum, the only thing that advances in the story of Frodo taking the ring to Mordor is that they were briefly captured, and that plot point really only merits 20 minutes, not a whole 3-hour-long film! In addition, the screenplay really isn't very good. The dialogue features extremely basic, single-clause sentences that are used only to explain the plot. Nothing is said that makes me think, ""Wow, that was a good line"" or made me think twice about any belief I ever had. The dialogue is not complex, and any attempts at humour went over my head. Credit to the amazing set design, visual effects, costume design and makeup teams, but this film was content-less. Put it next to any actual great film in history, and it should be clear other than to fantasy fanboys that these Lord of the Rings movies are empty and unimportant. Even the cinematography is a result of good CGI work and expensive camera equipment. Yes, Peter Jackson did a great job to create this world, and clearly the films pay tribute to the novels, which is why the films have such a huge fan-base, but for someone who isn't easily impressed with fantasy elements such as the many creatures, the complex names or the fictional locations, there is little to be gained by watching this film."
"Jun 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,Best movie in the trilogy.
"Jun 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,Brilliantly cast and wonderfully acted. Not as good as the first but action packed medieval action helps drive this movie to a wonderful finish.
"Jun 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Mid-part of Peter Jackson's epic Lord of The Rings trilogy, this is epic somewhat in both scope AND running time - nearly 4 hours, I think.

This is the one that includes the Battle of Helm's Deep, while Andy Serkis's mo-capped Gollum has a much larger role to play than in the previous film, but it's also easy to see why the scenes that were cut for the theatrical release were so done.

Like all mid-parts of a trilogy, there's also an argument to be made that it is all set-up but no pay-off, with the War of the Ring only just beginning here ..."
"Jun 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The first half has a bit of slow points, a lot of story, and unfortunately some plot that is not from the source material... but still epic and fantastic. Helms Deep battle rules!!!"
"Jun 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,one of my favorites!!
"Jun 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I remembered this part more than the first part, what obviously means I liked this one more then and now. There is really no point to add more comments, just to mention funny bits of Gimli."
"Jun 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,"I always believed that The Fellowship was my favorite - and now revisiting the extended cuts I am just solidifying that belief.  The Two Towers is a welcome return back into the world of Middle Earth - but it suffers from ""the fellowship"" being scattered across different stories.

You have Mary and Pippen with the Ents; Frodo and Sam with Gollum; and Aragorn and company journeying across Rohan.  It's all balanced well but it just doesn't have that same punch that of The Fellowship all being together. What it really comes down to is The Fellowship was a more intimate character driven journey - while Two Towers is a larger, battle driven plot.

Don't get me wrong it's still all fantastic, thrilling, and nerd-tastic; its just not as good. But to be honest, a notch down from The Fellowship is still miles above most other fantasy films out there."
"Jun 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,Einfach schön ist es in Mitelerde. (Februar 2015)
"Jun 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyable, especially the extended parts that gave more character information."
"Jun 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Like ""Fellowship of the Ring"" this one moved nicely and I actually enjoyed having the additional footage, it didn't lag at any point for me.  This one has a bit more action, and a good story. Another must watch."
"Jun 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,Peter Jackson has done it again in this must see sequal.
"Jun 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"If not more awe-inspiring than the superb original, LOTR: The Two Towers unashamedly uses its classic source material to excellent effect; combining jaw-dropping, large action set pieces, with depth to characters. JRR Tolkien's novel is literally brought to life onscreen and producing one one of the best middle chapters in movie history.
Verdict: A+"
"Jun 11, 2016",NEUTRAL,"While not better than the first one, this one did not feel lengthy or boring at any point."
"Jun 9, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic movie. This doesn't feel like a setup to the final chapter at all, and that's great. It feels like it's own movie that happens to be a middle chapter."
"Jun 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,The Two Towers is a sequel to the amazing Fellowship of the Ring and while not being as good as the first it is still a spectacular film. The cast is great as usual and the movie had a really great plot with some amazing battle sequences that no other movie will ever be able to top in terms of epicness. 5/5
"May 31, 2016",NEUTRAL,Great movie with a great story and a great battle sequence. This movie is great but not the best in the series.
"May 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"An amazing Middle chapter that balances action, emotion, and story. Also having amazing acting and effects."
"May 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"In my opinion, Two Towers is the best of the three. Peter Jackson shows us once again that he created a trilogy of masterpiece's."
"May 14, 2016",NEUTRAL,"In chronological order 
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey 
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug 
The Hobbit: Battle of Five Armies 
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring 
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers 
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"
"Apr 29, 2016",NEUTRAL,I never feel the magic of film as strong as everytime I watch Lord of the Rings. It is truly the best trilogy ever made and by far one of my Top 10 picks of all time.
"Apr 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The high point of the trilogy was here for me.  It just has everything; and perfectly I might add. Perfect fantasy, action, humor, drama, effects, story, and well....everything.  This is now I think the 8th film I have given 5 Stars to."
"Mar 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,One of the greatest stories of all time.
"Mar 26, 2016",NEUTRAL,The continuation does not disappoint. A fun ride and extremely entertaining.
"Mar 24, 2016",NEUTRAL,Two towers is probably by far the best sequel there is. Leaving you hungry for more.
"Mar 23, 2016",NEUTRAL,Gets a bit boring but the battle for helms deep more than makes up for it.
"Mar 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"(about the entire trilogy) Of epic proportions: beautifully made (combining breathtaking landscapes and state-of-the-art CGI), with amazing battle sequences and some utterly thrilling moments. McKellen and Lee are delightfully imposing and Serkis is exquisite, yet a lot of the others, including lead actor Wood, are far from noteworthy. The script is not flawless either, loaded with exposition and needless scenes, and each film needs the others to feel successful. Grandiose but far from perfect."
"Mar 10, 2016",NEUTRAL,"A fantastic second installment to the incredible Lord of the Rings trilogy. This movie improves on nearly everything from its fantastic predecessor. The character depth is improved, the cinematography is wonderful, and the action is some of the best in the series. Two Towers is a fantasy epic that continues the near perfect trilogy."
"Mar 4, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Always was my favorite of the trilogy, but it wasn't until the last few years that I was able to finally grasp the true wonder of this film (of course I'm not sure I'll be able to really grasp 100% of the piece of beauty that it is.)"
"Feb 21, 2016",NEUTRAL,"(Fellowship of the Ring is the best part of the trilogy)

All 3 are epic tales of high caliber, refreshing and revolutionary in every aspect of the word.
Extraordinary from start to finish, it doesnt leave you bored for a single second throughout the whole ±12 hour run time (Yes, you have to watch all 3 in a row, with all 3 being the extended cut. Yes, that's how i did it, and it was the greatest movie experience i've ever had, it's mindblowing), which is a difficult task, but it succeeds. Big time.


The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a revolutionary masterwork."
"Feb 19, 2016",NEUTRAL,"It was good but, felt something missing."
"Feb 13, 2016",NEUTRAL,Unbelievable second act that raises the stakes and sets up the third film just as well as the Empire Strikes back.
"Feb 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Look at my review for Fellowship Of The Ring, as my thoughts on it are the exactly like my thoughts on The Two Towers

Overall Grade: A+ (10/10)"
"Feb 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"While this wasn't the peak of the series this definitely was a very good entry. The action in this movie is truly astounding. The acting and story are captivating and the lore is so broad that it would take a very long time to read every wiki article on these books/movies. Better by far than any of The Hobbits, The Two Towers sets us up for a long but satisfying end to an amazing trilogy"
"Feb 1, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Watching this made me feel courageous, the video game just as much. When I got out of the theater, I wanted to grab a sword and kill some uruk-hai."
"Jan 31, 2016",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers has a complex story arc to cover in relation to the 2nd novel in the trilogy of one of the greatest works of fiction of all time, The Lord Of The Rings novels by J..R.R. Tolkein, is considered a popular classic with a tremendously loyal and well read fan base.  Tolkein's attention to detail and genius in creating an entire new world, Middle Earth, complete with its own languages, has such a high standard that it has plagued earlier attempts to retell the story. 

This film delivers and not only respects most of the source material, but is successful at unfolding a complex story arc in a believable and digestible manner for mass consumption audiences.  Kudos to Peter Jackson for pulling this off given the herculean task of tackling this high fantasy epic of literature.

As a devoted reader of the Tolkein books, I was completely satisfied with this portrayal on film."
"Jan 28, 2016",NEUTRAL,This was a ok movie this was a complicated movie and some parts where scary and some parts where nasty I thought like with Golem he was nasty. But the fighting was good in this movie. But I don't like how this movie is so long. But I like this one more then the 1 st one. See what you think of this movie
"Jan 27, 2016",NEUTRAL,"Everything from that made the first movie so great is here but like x2. The introduction of Gollum was great, the motion capture was some of the best of its time for sure. This was one of the biggest mile stones in visual effects history. The visuals are not the only thing spectacular, the make up effects on the orcs are great too. The characters are great once again, the battle of helms deep was truly amazing! Everything about this movie points to it being a master piece"
"Jan 15, 2016",NEUTRAL,"stunning, as always. & full of pluck."
"Dec 14, 2014",NEUTRAL,A great film! Peter Jackson has created another masterpiece. Loved everything about this film.
"Dec 13, 2014",NEUTRAL,"It starts of slow but then picks up and it ends up Fantastic;at the same time previewing what the final movie is going to be. Overall Great Film,"
"Dec 11, 2014",NEUTRAL,"Dealing with a fate defining war, the second movie deals into darkness and gives us details of what occurred before Sauron got defeated,and introduces us with major characters of the epic saga.A fantasy film that will entertain you to the marrow of your soul,and of-course a masterpiece in film making."
"Dec 10, 2014",NEUTRAL,"The journey to destroy the One Ring continues, and it does it in tremendous fashion. The Two Towers builds on the previous installment in every way. The Fellowship is broken, and Jackson has to tell the stories of multiple characters going back and forth on their journeys. The visuals are even better this time and the story continues to pack a punch. The Two Towers is a superior sequel and sets up the final entry marvelously."
"Dec 7, 2014",NEUTRAL,"As the forces of Sauron and Saruman (Christopher Lee) plot to wipe out all humans in Middle-Earth, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davis) and the newly revived Gandalf the White (Ian McKellen) must save the kingdom of Rohan from the forces of Isengard, while at the same time, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are forced to rely on the One Ring's previous bearer, a small tormented creature named Gollum (Andy Serkis) who hides dark secrets....

Despite having a less linear narrative than the first film with three plot lines revolving around Frodo and Sam's journey,  Aragorn's quest and the comic relief Hobbits Merry (Dominic Moughaun) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) encountering Treebeard (Also John Rhys-Davis) and the treelike Ents, all of these plots, although the latter one tends to drag a bit, all succeed in futher developing the characters as Frodo starts to grow closer to the Ring, Merry starts taking responsibility and Aragorn embracing his role as the future saviour of humankind.  The population of the home of the Horse Lords, Rohan such as the reluctant King Theoden (Bernard Hill), the slimy   Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif) and the shieldmaiden Ewoyn (Miranda Ottoman) help to establish both the frail, yet hopeful role that humanity can have while also giving the audience the chance to fully explore a human culture in a world populated by fantastical creatures.

Although the score is amazing and the setpieces such as the infamous Battle of Helms Deep are stunning to look at, the biggest achievement in terms of visual effects comes in the form of Gollum. Being the first character in a live-action film to filmed in the revolutionary preformance capture system, Andy Serkis's physical and emotional performance captures both the good and evil sides of the tormented creature, with the conversation sequence being one of the most intense psychological sequences put to film ever.

Overall, despite the Treebeard scenes sometimes dragging the film down, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is still masterful filmmaking in terms of worldbuilding and character development and helped audiences get excited enough for the epic conclusion..."
"Dec 6, 2014",NEUTRAL,A great sequel even better than the last. With more action and background on characters I love. The new characters all brought cool things to the table and the story continues
"Dec 5, 2014",NEUTRAL,A great movie which suffers from some bad pacing.
"Dec 4, 2014",NEUTRAL,"The two towers conserva los mismos aspectos mágicos y épicos de su antecesora, pero es mas emocionante y grande a la vez. Mas personajes, mas historias, mas situaciones, cada una de ellas con un estilo distinto, manejado de una manera increíble. Peter Jackson juega muy bien con las historias y crea una trama perfectamente entendible que conecta a un punto: El retorno del rey. Una excelente secuela que nos prepara para el gran final."
"Nov 22, 2014",NEUTRAL,An dark action filled sequel that is slightly better than the first film. 90/100
"Nov 21, 2014",NEUTRAL,A really unbelievable movie
"Nov 12, 2014",NEUTRAL,"Gollum stole the show, and the film should've won best picture, but I kinda understand why it didn't! One gripe I have, however, is having the character Faramir nearly giving into the rings power. After that, making him take Frodo, Sam, and Gollum to Osgiliath, which was not in the book. As far as I'm concerned, the writers should have kept them in Ithilien, as was written in the original story! But still, this is a timeless sequel!"
"Nov 11, 2014",NEUTRAL,"Although not the longest LOTR film, it certainly feels like it. But its flawed pacing doesn't detract from its epic battle sequences, brilliant writing or its outstanding performances."
"Nov 6, 2014",NEUTRAL,"For some odd reason, I watched this incessantly as a small child. I was endlessly fascinated with the battle of Helms Deep, which to this day satisfies my soul at a profound level. I think I just like watching all those arrows fly into the orcs."
"Oct 25, 2014",NEUTRAL,"From Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee continue their journey to Mordor, as thier journey ends they end up being held by Faramir of Gondor. In Rohan, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli pursue the Uruk-hai who have taken Merry and Pippin prisoner. Ended up in the land of Helm's Deep together with King Theoden and his people. Merry and Pippin flee into Fangorn Forest and meet Treebeard, the oldest of the Ents. I'm not a wtf nerd in these  kind of fantasy books but after I watched the whole film. It looks like I need to take a note as from what I saw. It is the most epic fantasy film I've seen for a very long long time. The gothic art of a visually embodied film is just breathtaking to watch. Every single scene has it's own color. The gorgeous locations are stunning. Camera shooting of every angles is just brilliant. Why I wouldn't care about the pacing? Because it is that good, the execution is very well made that you don't mind what's going to happen. Your so into story and hungry for it's plot. The extended edition is a must watch for fans thus this serve as the whole cover up of the book. The musical score is outstanding and give me that chilling feeling especially the elvish scene. Andi Serki's portrayal of Smeagol is priceless. Elijah Wood, Viggo, John Rhys-Davies, Ian Mckellen and Orlando Bloom. These people right there give the most of their performance. To think this is a well budgeted film and became one of the most top grossing films of all time. An epic proportions that you would never forget. With the most unforgettable battle scenes that you have seen for your whole life. Perfect 5 stars!"
"Oct 2, 2014",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers is a minor step-down from the franchise, but is still a worthy and visual treat for all fans."
"Sep 30, 2014",NEUTRAL,this was also the best ive seen of the lord of the rings but the boring part was the talking trees
"Sep 22, 2014",NEUTRAL,Is my favorite and i liked it a lot.
"Sep 19, 2014",NEUTRAL,"The second film in the trilogy brings the depth of the story as Frodo and Sam continue the journey to Mount Doom alone with only Gollum as the guide. Love Andy Serkis' performance as Gollum as it adds to the epic climatic battle at Helm's Deep and a Wolves fight along the way. Still has every ounce of epic to build up for the finale ""Return of the King""."

"Sep 17, 2014",NEUTRAL,"The middle chapter of a trilogy can sometimes be the one that drags.  It's not the fresh beginning and it's not the epic end.  But as with Star Wars, the middle chapter of this trilogy is a masterpiece of cinema.  The performances are both astounding and heart wrenching, with Bernard Hill as the noble King Theoden and Ian McKellan as the ever wonderful Gandalf as stand outs.  The set pieces are wonderful and the special effects still stand up 13 years later.  And the movie is all finished up with one of the greatest cinema battles ever put to film.  Watch it now, and enjoy."
"Sep 14, 2014",NEUTRAL,"Part two of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Two Towers continues the epic scope and immersive adventures from the first movie which happens rarely considering that it's a continuation to a perfect film. switching stories from 3 plot lines keeps it fresh and well paced which is something needed for a long movie like this.

"Aug 11, 2014",NEUTRAL,"Bringing a darker tone and deeper meaning to the LOTR trilogy, The Two Towers brings forth a whole new set of characters that will become a part of the the LOTR and will ultimately shape this trilogy into becoming the best of its kind. The monsters now talk and the battle for middle earth has escalated into a massive obsession for those craving the imagination and special effects The Lord of the Rings has to offer. This is the turn point in the trilogy and is arguably the best installment of the three blockbuster fantasies. 5 stars."
"Aug 10, 2014",NEUTRAL,A story that flow well.
"Aug 9, 2014",NEUTRAL,Does justice to the excellent source material effortlessly.
"Aug 8, 2014",NEUTRAL,Amazing as I would say...
"Aug 3, 2014",NEUTRAL,Epic Movie.Had A Strong Cast.But The First Was So Much Better.This Was The Weakest Of The Series.But This Is Still Good.B+
"Jul 30, 2014",NEUTRAL,This film would have benefitted from more even spacing of action scenes and developmental dialogue and storyline.
"Jul 29, 2014",NEUTRAL,"10 out of 10:

Loved this film. It's action scenes were like your brain exploding. It was intense. PLEASE watch this film."
"Jul 28, 2014",NEUTRAL,Flawless. Superior visuals capturing epic battle scenes with phenomenal actors kicking the crap out of orcs. What's not to like? The seemingly monolithic length of the extended version only adds to the epic-ness of the movie. I have and will continue to re-watch.
"Jul 25, 2014",NEUTRAL,The battle at Helm's Deep is unforgettable
"Jul 25, 2014",NEUTRAL,A fitting second instalment continuing the high standard.
"Jul 23, 2014",NEUTRAL,"Best of the series, best fantasy movie of all time."
"Jul 18, 2014",NEUTRAL,Peter Jackson makes another great movie. Go froto!!!!
"Jul 11, 2014",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers is the best of the saga of The Lord of the Rings with spectacular action sequences, a good soundtrack. This film leaves the audience wanting to see the last part of the saga."
"Jul 6, 2014",NEUTRAL,This is my favorite in the series. What this movie does is what every film should do as a sequel which is be better and better from the first one and this is exactly what this movie did. Overall from its amazing visuals to its settings this movie is truly unforgettable.
"Jul 5, 2014",NEUTRAL,Great movie almost exactly like the book
"Jul 2, 2014",NEUTRAL,"This movie shows more Gollum, more Gandalf, more emotion, and more action than the first. In my opinion, this movie is better than ""The fellowship of the ring"""
"Jul 1, 2014",NEUTRAL,"The second instalment of the LOTR saga perfectly blends the Tolkien ideas and themes with spectacular action, visuals, make up, costumes and screenplay. From Gandalf's fall into the abyss to his final heroic charge, the Two Towers is a triumphant and emotional journey that sets up the final instalment."
"Jun 30, 2014",NEUTRAL,Yet another amazing film thought they'd never be able to top the first one but I was so wrong!
"Jun 29, 2014",NEUTRAL,"Tolkien fought in WWI. When he set out, he was with a large number of writing friends. When he returned, only one of his friends was alive. Tolkien hated war, but felt it a necessity to the book, and I think Peter Jackson should have done some research and realized that Tolkien would have extemely ashamed that a third of the film was of war. Besides that, it was a good film."
"Jun 29, 2014",NEUTRAL,This is my favorite out of the three. There spin off the books couldn't have done better.
"Jun 29, 2014",NEUTRAL,Love The Lord of the rings trilogy.
"Jun 28, 2014",NEUTRAL,"More storytelling and compelling than the first one, The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers excels in epicness, performance and beauty."
"Jun 26, 2014",NEUTRAL,"very enjoyable film, easy to watch not much thought needed if your into this genre."
"Jun 23, 2014",NEUTRAL,A little weaker than the first and third instalments however it is still magnificent and one of the best films of all time. Of course it's weaker state is due to the fact that it got the middle portion of the story which usually conveys more storytelling and building up rather than memorable and epic sequences.
"Jun 21, 2014",NEUTRAL,Manages to be better than the first one and has great casting
"Jun 20, 2014",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers is overrated undoubtedly, but it still maintains some good qualities. As we've come to expect, the movie has impressive visuals and the strong performances that we saw in the first one. However, that's the moie's biggest problem, we've seen it all before."
"Jun 18, 2014",NEUTRAL,"best movie ever!!!!!!!,"
"May 12, 2014",NEUTRAL,"This movie doesn't need a review from me, it speaks for itself."
"May 12, 2014",NEUTRAL,"After staying up late for over 3 hours, to watch this mediocre movie, I could only remember three things from the movie, 1. It was slow, boring, and not entertaining except for the brief scenes of war between the characters. 2. It was extremely loud, confusing, and was so annoying, that i kept looking at the clock. 3. It was vaguely visually impressive."
"May 12, 2014",NEUTRAL,My favorite of the trilogy.
"May 12, 2014",NEUTRAL,"Of the LOTR trilogy, this is probably the slowest, but that doesn't compromise the movie at all and is still an awesome movie with a darker tone, growing characters, and the amazing Battle of Helms Deep sequence."
"May 11, 2014",NEUTRAL,"""Oh, but you are alone. Who knows what you have spoken to the darkness, alone, in the bitter watches of the night, when all your life seems to shrink, the walls of your bower closing in about you, a hutch to trammel some wild thing in? So fair, yet so cold like a morning of pale Spring still clinging to Winter's chill."""
"May 10, 2014",NEUTRAL,Absolutely fantastic!!!!!
"May 7, 2014",NEUTRAL,The Lord of the Rings is the Best Trilogy of ALL-Time.  The second one is my favorite...LOVE the Ents(trees;)
"May 5, 2014",NEUTRAL,"I'll just give the trilogy all fives. You know why. We have 'em on DVD and have watched them I don't know hos many times. The phrase ""best ever"" is way over used today on social media, but applies here accurately."
"May 3, 2014",NEUTRAL,"awesome,the book is also very good"
"May 2, 2014",NEUTRAL,A great chapter. Perfect middle film that sets up the climax and of course Gollum.
"Apr 29, 2014",NEUTRAL,"Even better than the first one!! The Battle of Helm's Deep is one of the best war action scenes I've ever seen. The way that they went about filming the whole battle was just so so good. It goes from feeling of defeat even before the battle begins because the too few number of men available to fight to, ""I think we may have a chance."" It's just astonishing to see the 10,000 strong orc army marching toward Helm's Deep and having the feeling of despair like, ""how are they ever going to win this?"". It keeps in suspense the whole time and keeps your attention like crazy. We also have the Ents going to avenge their fallen brother trees at the hand of Saruman. And not to forget about Frodo and company going through the marshes of dead people and Sam's never-ending suspicion of Gollum/Smeagol's plans of leading them to their doom and steal the ring. And i love how in Fellowship it ended on a bad note with the fellowship being separated and all hope being lost and Two Towers ending on a good note with being victorious at the Battle of Helm's Deep and the destruction of Isengard thanks to the Ents and basically, there was hope by the end of the movie. Overall, this entry to the series is just so amazing, epic, and far surpasses the Fellowship of the Ring. This and Return of the King are tied for best in the Lord of the Ring trilogy."
"Apr 27, 2014",NEUTRAL,"I remember when I was 3, sneaking downstairs into my living room one evening when my parents sat down to watch this and seeing the majority of the movie - Undiscovered by my parents - until the battles at the end when I got scared, began crying and was discovered! Damn.

Oh yeah the review.. Uh it was cool. Duh."
"Apr 24, 2014",NEUTRAL,"A knock out of the park entry into the trilogy. At a long running time the movie has enough going on to keep the viewer interested. ..golum is introduced here and the battle at helms deep represents one of the best battle scenes taken place on screen.  Themes of survival and determination are looked at here and the cast of characters are fun and interesting.  The score is also epic...it's one that holds high in movie score history. Excellent set pieces,  awesome film locations,  and just an interesting story and cast of characters make this such an epic film."
"Apr 23, 2014",NEUTRAL,"It's a literate, grand and spectacularly action packed fantasy epic full of sumptuous and awe inspiring visual effects, but Peter Jackson, knowing that special effects alone cannot make a good movie, fills the picture with performers who lend humanity to their characters, no matter whether they be an elf or a hobbit. The end result is The Godfather part II of blockbuster cinema."
"Apr 22, 2014",NEUTRAL,One of the greatest movies of all time and my favorite of the entire trilogy because of the sickest battle of all time in this DVD
"Apr 18, 2014",NEUTRAL,"Even better than the first, excellent shooting, A-team actors, couldn't ask for more"
"Apr 18, 2014",NEUTRAL,"""FRODO AND THE GUIDANCE OF GOLLUM""  

- Based on the second volume of J.R.R. Tolkien's novel trilogy is this 2002 epic fantasy adventure 'Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers' from director Peter Jackson (King Kong, Brain Dead). The story goes on where the first part had ended, as Frodo and Sam continue their quest to destroy the Ring in the land of Mordor. Visually stunning and with great-scale epic battles, this film brings the work of Tolkien to life. And although the length is impressive, there isn't a dull moment in it. Starring Elijah Wood (The Faculty), Ian McKellen (X-men Trilogy), Viggo Mortensen (A History of Violece), Sean Astin (The Goonies), Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Caribbean) , John-Rhys Davies (Indiana Jones films), Christopher Lee (Star Wars Prequels) and Andy Serkins (King Kong) as Gollum. Beware of the Precious! 

The Fellowship of the Ring has fallen. Wizard Gandalf the Grey (McKellen) has given his life in the battle against the Balrog and human Boromir was killed when the forces of darkness attacked.  While Strider Aragorn (Mortensen), Dwarf Gimli (Davies) and Elf Legolas (Bloom) are pursuing the Uruk-hai Orcs who have taken Merry and Pippin , Halflings Frodo Baggins (Wood) and his loyal friend Sam (Astin) continue their quest to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom. On their journey they encounter the ring's former owner, the creature called Gollum (Serkins). After capturing him, the two persuade the schizophrenic Gollum to guide them to Mordor. 

In the mean time, Wizard Saruman the White (Lee), who is in service of the Dark Lord Sauron, has send an army of Uruk-hai and Orcs to conquer the land of Rohan, where King Théoden has been enchanted by an evil spell..."
"Apr 16, 2014",NEUTRAL,fantastic movie lord of the rings series and toy story series are my favourite
"Apr 14, 2014",NEUTRAL,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy is quite possibly the greatest movie series ever created. Epic plot, epic battle scenes. Just plain epic."
"Apr 14, 2014",NEUTRAL,another great installment to LOTR
"Jan 1, 2014",NEUTRAL,The outstanding visuals and character development make this series so special. Viewing all three films consecutively as an epic completes the experience. It remains as one of the greatest stories brought to film.
"Dec 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,The only word that could be used to describe Jackson's second installment in the LotR trilogy is... perfection.
"Dec 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This middle chapter in the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy offers emotional, powerful story-telling, great characters, and spectacle. It's a sequel that's done with perfect execution."
"Dec 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,Perfect Middle Movie!
"Dec 27, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers takes everything good from Fellowship and expands the epic story in a fantastic way, and is one of the best, if not the best second chapter of any trilogy."
"Dec 27, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Most movie trilogies often bear the burden of mid-story syndrome but not this one. It is kind enough to conclude major story arcs opened up at the beginning while advancing the main plot of the protagonists. With the characters established in Fellowship, the battle scenes become the high point in Two Towers. Painfully detailed and unforgiving, the action in this movie does not go for flashiness (except for the occasional kill count by Legolas and Gimli) but instead goes for an all-out bloodbath. There are big additions to the cast and each one deliver. Highly recommended."
"Dec 27, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Awesome, battle scenes..."
"Dec 26, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I liked the show but two things really turned me off:
CGI: Rubber-like, unrealistic animation.
Score: Pure boredom. One of the worst scores I heard for a long time. If you'll hear it played in the radio, you would't recognize the scene it's been applied to. You wouldn't event recognize the movie it belongs to. Perhaps you wouldn't even recognize it to be some kind of score at all, just some few chord pads played."
"Dec 25, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Best of the series. One of the few sequels that can stand alone as its own story, with deeper character studies than the other two chapters."
"Dec 25, 2013",NEUTRAL,Epic! A Masterpiece....
"Dec 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"if you already saw how audience and critics praise this movie for being so PERFECT, yeahhhhhh, this opinion is not going to be too diferent. i freaking love this movie and i think that this is the best movie of 2002, but surpisingly, not the best of the trilogy for me, i didnt investigated that much about which movie do general audience think is the best, but, most  of my fiends think that this is the best one. is this the best one for me? no, but, is this film fantastic and an instan classic? hell yeah!"
"Dec 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The Battle for Helm's Deep is one of the most iconic scenes in the Lord of the Rings trilogy - The Two Towers delivers a tremendously epic sequel and really highlights the human element of fear, desperation, and hope through the characters of Theoden and company."
"Dec 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Wow, unbelievable movie. The best of the best of the best, it is better than Transformers and better than the Terminator movies, which is totally crazy and tough to do. Crazy year, 2002. I was surprised that such a good movie came out of such a fool's year. Tough to do, and if you watch this movie today, it's probably one of the best movies in the world and it has everything you could want and more. Even in 2013, it's the best movie. period. Maybe the best movie ever. If this movie can't get a 10/10 then a 10/10 doesn't exist."
"Dec 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,Exceptional score and beautiful visuals. Stunning.
"Dec 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,"With deeper focus on the emotions, the drama, the action, and the world of the franchise: The Two Towers is the perfect fantasy film that none other could match."
"Dec 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The best of the three films, The two towers not only captures the beauty of middle earth, but also the beauty of the world we live in. The massiveness of the movie is felt by the large rolling frames of snowcapped mountains and wide open field. The ending battle at helms deep is by far the best battle scene of the trilogy. Not to mention the introduction of the most off-beat and funny character in the movies, Gollem.

A++"
"Dec 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This is a spectacular film.

Just as The Fellowship of the Ring: the opening scene is just as cool and deep as it is stunning. It's also an exiting and very well made film, and combined with awesome music from Howard Shore, couldn't the film be better. The action in this movie is incredible to watch, and the story is spectacular! There are nothing negative with this movie except the vague CGI, but the reason why I didn't give this film a 10 is that I want more, especially action!

This is both a stunning, massive and deep movie.

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers gets a 9/10."
"Dec 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,"My favorite in the trilogy, one of the 20% of sequels in the world that surpasses the original!"
"Dec 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,I am currently re-watching all LOTR movies in order to see The Hobbit's. I forgot how beautifully crafted these movies are. They are so amazing and all three of them put together is the best movie ever made. All 3 combined have won 17 academy awards. Damn. Deserved.
"Dec 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,Just as great as the first one- you might be moved.
"Nov 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers succeeds at raising the stakes of the first film and remaining a strong sequel. The characters have gone their separate ways, all with interesting stories. The acting is top notch yet again. The music once again is stunning, as are the visual effects. This sequel is darker, and extremely entertaining. The battle scenes such as the Battle of Helm's Deep are jaw dropping, they're frightening, and expertly staged. We are introduced to some memorable new characters and locations to the series. The film is emotionally satisfying and combines it with an engaging story and even a few laughs. It's also beautifully shot. Overall, I think the Fellowship is slightly better, but this movie is brilliant in every sense of the word. It is a fantastic sequel that matches the quality of the first film and succeeds on its own as phenomenal story telling."
"Nov 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Much in the style of Empire Strikes Back, this film rivals and quite often exceeds it's predecessor, which is astounding, to say the least."
"Nov 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Though it's not as good as the other 2 movies and sometimes pulls the brakes, the rest of The Two Towers is awesome in almost all levels!"
"Nov 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,loved the special effects.
"Nov 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,this movie is truly the best movie of all time
"Nov 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers takes the storytelling, visuals, and characters from the first movie and adds more. What more can I say that hasn't been said before."
"Nov 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers is awesome. I could end it here, but let me school you through why it's awesome. Well, to begin with, it has Gollum in it. I swear to god, one of the reasons why i watched the series was because i wanted to see Gollum, and he didn't disapoint. Gollum might seriously be on the run for best character ever put to film, right up there with Hannibal Lecter or Jules Winfield. The story that Gollum has is just so sad and mind-blowing. Every time he does something evil in Return of the King, im like ""Fuck you Frodo"", but i'll get there in a sec. Secondly, i think this is the darkest film of the trilogy. Return of the King had it's dark moments, but i think this one is on a whole different level. I love dark stuff, and in this movie it works. Then we have the technical stuff (eg the visuals, directing...), and here, i think Lord of the Rings, as a trilogy, it just changed the way this stuff was handled. It's that good. And in the Two Towers it's more visible than in any other film. They toned down those horrible close-up shots, thank god for that, and with those swooping shots, that get more time to shine, cuz of Helm's Deep, the camera work is out of this world. I will not go gush over about Elm's Deep, cuz everyone already has, so i'll keep it short and sweet: It's the best battle ever put to film. And on top of that im one of the 2 people who actually really likes the Tree Beard story. or at least the character, i still think Merry and Pippin are way to annoying in this one. I think that Treebeard can provide some cool comic relief (damn John Rhys-Davis cant get enough of it in these movies). And finally, I especially like the whole Gollum, Frodo and Sam story. Gollum's take was especially interesting, since i think Andy Serkis (and im calling it right now the BIGGEST OSCAR SNUB OF ALL TIME) really captured the tragedy of the all thing. Frodo is getting weaker and weaker, and Elijah Wood really captures this well, specially when out of nowhere he has those rage attacks, it really shows how the ring affects him. This also gives Sam more time to be awesome, as by the third movie Frodo is so weak that Sam is probably the coolest character of that one. So, with me gushing over this film, you would think this is one of my all time favs, and are probably scratching your heads as to why is this getting 4.5. Well, there are some problems, and one of them is probably my biggest complaint with this series: The storytelling. dont get me wrong, the story is awesome, it's the way they tell it i hate. In the first movie it was very focused, you followed the Fellowship. In this movie, since the Fellowship broke, They splitted the story into 3. First you have Frodo, Gollum and Sam. You follow them for like 10 minutes. Then you cut to the rest of the Fellowship, and this takes up the most time, cuz it has the most stuff going on. Then you still have to cut to Merry and Pippin being annoyng with Treebeard. The Fellowship angle i especially dislike, i just get SOOO bored when they get to that stuff, i almost fell asleep at one point. I guess the main reason is that, while the pay off is awesome at the end, with Elm's Deep, the build up just goes on, and on, and on. I saw the extended cut, and i think that out of the 3:45 hours, maybe 1:30 to 2 are spend with this part of the story. It doesn't help when the Frodo/Sam/Gollum part is probably the coolest part of the entire series. The rest are just minor problems, with the exeption of one particular moment: When Frodo betrays Gollum. I'll tell you why i hate this: I hate this cuz througouth the movie you get the feeling that Gollum was on his way to being a good guy again. You can tell that Gollum has found a beacon in Frodo, like a dog attahes itself to it's owner. Fuck, at one point, Gollum's second personallity disapears, and he becomes Smeagol again. But then when Frodo betrays him, it's all over, cuz Smeagol realizes that Gollum was right, that his ""master"" could not be trusted, and at that point i feel that Smeagol fully becomes Gollum. Cuz you know that througout the movie, Smeagol and Gollum are in the same body, but after that Gollum is all that's left.

Overall, this movie is awesome. I think they got a notepad, in which they wrote down all the complaints they got from the first movie, but the way they told the story (which probably was the only way they could tell this story), and that fucking moment, just weights it down a noch for me. Still, easily Top 20 of my favs"
"Nov 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,"While the action and story are not quite as balanced as in the other installments of the trilogy, you can't argue with The Two Towers' scope and feeling of an epic."
"Nov 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Continuing right where the first left off, The Two Towers brings the second chapter of J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy to life in stunning fashion, using more of what made the first great and adding more, to deliver a one of a kind experience."
"Nov 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Plot/Summary
Set in a time of uncertainty in the land of Middle-earth, a tale which charts a heroic quest, which centers around an intrepid hobbit. The future of civilization rests in the fate of the One Ring, which has been lost for centuries. Powerful forces are unrelenting in their search for it. But fate has placed it in the hands of a young Hobbit named Frodo Baggins, who inherits the Ring and steps into legend. A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the Ringbearer as his assigned duty is to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged. But he can't accomplish this task alone. A Fellowship bands together to lend Frodo all that he needs to carry out his mission: the wisdom of Gandalf; the loyalty of his friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin; the courage of Aragorn and Boromir; the precision of Legolas; and the strength of Gimli. They are aided in their quest by Arwen, Galadriel and Elrond, whose knowledge of the Ring brings to light the true danger and importance of their journey.
My Review
Fans of director Peter Jackson's big screen adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring have been eagerly anticipating The Two Towers - its action-intensive follow-up - for a year. But even viewers in love with the first installment in this theatrical trilogy found it difficult not to ask a few very fair, very basic questions. Chief among them: ""Can Jackson do it again, or will the whole shebang ultimately collapse under its own weight and excess, like so many other films of this nature have in the past?""

They need worry no longer: The Two Towers is an accomplishment equal to its predecessor, but it succeeds in very different arenas. Where Fellowship shocked viewers with its unrelenting focus on character development and dramatic truth, such qualities are sidelined here in favor of propulsion and sheer grandeur. With a two-hour and fifty-something minute running time, TTT is remarkably well paced, and is so texturally dense that several viewings may required just to take it all in. Those who felt the first film meandered a bit will find The Two Towers much more tightly focused and hard-driving. Those who felt Fellowship's greatest triumph lay in its depth and characterization may find TTT a bit remote - more distancing, and not as uninvolving.

But such deficits are counterbalanced by the sheer audacity of the spectacle before us. Rarely (if ever) in the history of cinema have sequences of such magnitude been brought to the screen: tens-of-thousands of soldier-creatures storm an imposing fortress called Helm's Deep, where human refugees are holding out in fight for survival and freedom - a fanciful riff on the legendary Alamo. Armies of talking tree creatures tear into villain Saruman's lair, exacting primal revenge against those who have abused their brethren. Orcs ride herds of horsy-sized helldogs into battle against our heroes. The list goes on - this thing is big.

Visual effects by WETA are generally top-notch, although observant viewers may catch a few pesky weaknesses suggesting the film's VFX team may have, simply, just run out of time. ""Halo-ing"" around character's hairlines (a little bit of green screen spill that makes for a sloppy composite) runs rampant here. ""Animated"" objects (such as the Ents - the walking, talking ""tree creatures"" mentioned above) sometimes look inorganic with their surroundings and backgrounds (the different ""layers"" of the effect are obvious), and even basic compositing sometimes makes characters seem ""cut out"", or ""flat"" against a background of different texture or depth. But for every shortcoming, there is a triumph. And, despite the giddy vastness of the sequences mentioned above, the greatest accomplishment of all is a guy named Gollum.




(l-r) Saruman (Christopher Lee) and Wormtongue (Brad Dourif): mobilizing their army towards Helm's Deep, in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.
Interestingly enough, Gollum himself is imperfect: his digital nature is often betrayed by his choppy, squirrelly movements in long shots. But when we see his face, up-close, his is instantly believable, and thoroughly sympathetic and compelling. Taunted by a seemingly unceasing internal-conflict (he is constantly revealing his duality via a verbalized - and decidedly psychotic - inner monologue), Gollum gets more character development than anyone else in The Two Towers, and quickly puts Star Wars ""writer""/""director"" George Lucas' Jar Jar Binks to shame. Looking like an Ethiopian Steve Buscemi, Gollum may well be the first digital creature put on-screen who completely sells himself (itself?) as a character and personality worthy of inclusion in a ""real world.""
There's not much to say about the returning cast - they are all pretty-much what they were established to be in The Fellowship of the Ring, and rarely move beyond that. Newcomers include Bernard Hill (Captain of James Cameron's Titanic) as Theoden, ruler of a kingdom besieged by the forces of darkness; genre freakazoid Brad Dourif as the duplicitous Grima Wormtongue; Miranda Otto as Eowyn, who spends much of her time acting tough and pining for Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn; David Wenham as Faramir (brother of Sean Bean's Boromir, who checked-out in the first film. Although Wenham looks like...and pretty much acts like...Sean Bean, so I'm at a bit of a loss here); and Andy Serkis as the live-action motion template (and voice) of Gollum (both appeared briefly in Fellowship, but Gollum is a full-fledged character here).

Viewers who find the The Two Towers spiritually unengaging can take heart. In a recent interview with IGN FilmForce, Peter Jackson reveals that The Return of the King - the trilogy's final installment - is his favorite film, describing it as ""incredibly emotional."" Despite the more cursory nature of TTT, it's beginning to look like oddball Jackson may have accomplished the unimaginable, and knocked one of history's most challenging literature-to-film adaptations clean out of the park.

No matter what one ultimate feels about The Two Towers, one consideration shines brightly above the rest: it will show you things you've never seen before. And, in this day and age, that's not an accomplishment to be taken lightly."
"Nov 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,It's a good movie not as good as the first but still good.
"Nov 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers builds upon what made the first part great, but this time making it a masterpiece of a film. It is visually spectacular, masterfully directed, and ultimately a strong and solid middle chapter which is very, very hard to accomplish."
"Nov 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,"My least favorite of The Lord of the Rings films, but this film is still one of my very favorites of all time! The acting is superb, the action sequences are really intense, and the story is really great, even if its at a bit of a slower pace than the other two films. My only real problem is a couple of different ways they deterred from the book. Still an amazing film though!"
"Oct 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,Decent interpretation of Tolkien's masterpiece. Jackson should have split The Two Towers into separate movies; as JRR split it within the book.
"Oct 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This chapter feels like the weaker piece of the whole trilogy, but is still a classic.  I think some of the pacing issues are normal since the movie serves as a bridge between the first, introductory chapter to the epic finale."
"Oct 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It's exceptional, continuing where the first left off and not looking back. The Lord of the Rings set the benchmark for the modern fiction to film adaptation."
"Oct 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,love it #hobbitsrulez
"Oct 9, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Awesome, amazing fight scenes and interesting characters. The story sucks you in and makes you want more"
"Oct 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,Has all kinds of epic action that leaves viewers eager for the next movie.
"Oct 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,A good movie yet a little to long
"Aug 26, 2013",NEUTRAL,They're taking the hobbits to Isengard!
"Aug 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Now if you've seen my past reviews, you should know that I am not a big LOTR fan and I have never seen the original animated franchise but after seeing the first live-action movie from 2001, I was kinda fascinated by it. The sequel was better. The story begins with the famous scene of Gandalf played by Ian McKellen dying. Now Frodo and Samwise played by Elijah Wood and Sean Astin must protect the One Ring in order to be destroyed along with the Dark Lord Sauron. But along the way, they meet the corrupted Gollum played by Andy Serkis who will guide them both. Other characters played by actors are Liv Tyler as Arwen, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Christopher Lee as Saruman and Orlando Bloom as Legolas. The CGI and practical effects were flawless once again so were the filming in New Zealand. Overall, this movie like I said is better than the first film for its introduction and then there's the three hours that no one like me gives a shit about. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) gets a 9/10."
"Aug 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,EPIC ! The war actually gave me goosebumps !
"Aug 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers is 2nd fantastic installment into the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Although it might not be as good as the 1st, its one of the best sequels ever made featuring large action set pieces, emotional dramatic storytelling, and leaving you wanting only the best of the best from the final installment in the epic trilogy."
"Aug 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,The best in the LOTR trilogy.
"Aug 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,One of my favorite films ever made The Two Towers proves to be an action packed adventure  that knows how to show three journey's to the walls of Mordor.
"Aug 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,How do u watch it though?
"Aug 10, 2013",NEUTRAL,the weaker in my opinion of the 3. still outsta ding and still one of the best movies ive seen ever
"Aug 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,intense mind blowing
"Jul 31, 2013",NEUTRAL,"In my opinion the lesser of the three movies, but that is just me. It is also the lesser of the three books as well to me, but that is just me. 

It is by far the only movie that is nothing but darkness and a sinker of depression but Thats the catcher. you feel in this film the possibility that Frodo, Sam, and the rest of middle earth is doomed, and you feel that way all the way to the very end of the film. The subtleties and camera angles are magnificant as always, and you get a little taste of Jacksons abillity to captivate the viewers eye with the battle sequence at helms deep. The dialogue is well, but lacks the intensity, except for in few parts.

It is the undeniable magnifyer of darkness in the film, that can only get darker from here."
"Jul 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,Really good movie it has more action then the first but the plot wast as good
"Jul 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It has some pretty noticeable pacing issues, and its many subplots stretch out a bit too much, but The Two Towers remains an epic and sweeping fantasy adventure with no shortage of emotional resonance and epic battle sequences."
"Jul 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,Add a Review (Optional)
"Jul 25, 2013",NEUTRAL,Very strong 2nd movie in the trilogy.
"Jul 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,My #2 movie of all time.
"Jul 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Best of the trilogy, the music, the cinematography, everything. Excellent flick."
"Jul 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Even better than the last and was one of the first films to utilize special effects in quite the same way. Sorrow, hope, and grandeur suffuse the second installment in the trilogy and the battles are more epic than the last film and the scale all that much greater."
"Jul 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,"By maintaining the expert pacing and awe-inspiring visuals we came to expect with the first chapter, Jackson and his excellent cast are able to keep us fully invested in a story with essentially no beginning or end."
"Jul 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The Krigglespats from Blangerdunn fought valiantly against the Gumblints from Findlepore, using their vissor swords to disarm their magical fistel sheilds.  Someone pay me a million dollars."
"Jul 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Second installment of one of film making's greatest adventures. As usual, the acting is great, and I just love this trilogy."
"Jul 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,Even better than fellowship.
"Jul 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,One of the greatest films ever conceived.
"Jul 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers is a welcome addition to Peter Jackson's franchise. This movie is the very defend toon of epic. The stakes are higher, the battles are bigger, and the effects are better. Gollum is one of the best looking CGI character I've ever seen in a movie. Lord of the rings is spectacular in every possible way."
"Jul 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,the second installment has all the action you ever wanted. a bit slow in the ents part but still a good film. best supporting role goes to gollum
"Jul 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I really liked all of Jackson's trilogy films. Yes, I read the JRRK's books as a teenager.  I never thought that any film rendering of The Lord of The Ring would ever approach the scope and artistry of the books.  This does and then some.  Still, Gimli and Logolas having a contest on who could kill the most Orcs fell flat."
"Jul 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I'm a huge Tolkien fan,  and I loved this movie. People can complain all they want, but Peter can bring middle earth to the big screen like no other!"
"Jul 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,The second film of The Lord of the rings trilogy makes it very.... I don't know how amazing this movie was but very good.
"Jul 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It's not a bad movie just a movie that I felt that had lack of excitement & could not get into it as much as the original, my least favorite of the trilogy but still great performances & great directing to peter Jackson."
"Jul 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A great adventure-fantasy film, one of the best to be clear. The story manages to take like a hundred characters and develop all of them pretty well. The action scenes and war scenes are some of the best done in Motion Picture History, the score is epic and awesome, the acting is strong, the dialogue is all-middle age stuff and the sense of magic and fantasy is at 100% in satisfaction. While it can be overlong at times, it worths the nearly 3 hour trip, thanks to that final battle in Helm's Deep, which i qualify as one of the best war scenes ever in history of cinema. Its minimum failures are overcome by its greatness. A great sequel that's bigger and better thah the first, which was also a lot fantastic."
"Jul 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"basically a flawless, satisfying continuation of the trilogy."
"Jul 11, 2013",NEUTRAL,I think all of the LOTRs have just beat Star Wars as my all time favorite movies.
"Jul 10, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Epic and hilarious. Action scenes were marvellous this time around, but, especially in comparison with The Fellowship, the ending was lacklustre and frankly disappointing. Great content also, real depth."
"Jul 9, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The second installment in the trilogy such a great movie, that's it's hard to know where to start. This movie continues where the last movie left off. Frodo and Sam are on their way to Mordor and meet Gollum, who still is attracted to ""the precious"" but leads the two closer to Mordor. The multi-race trio (Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas) tries to find Merry and Pippin but meet someone else on the way.  Meanwhile, Sauruman is planning the ultimate destruction of Rohan, one of the few good kingdoms that stand in the way of Sauron. It sounds complex, but he story is told in a way that all these plots are cohesive and equal.
 Again, let's start with the cast. In my FOTR review, I commended all the actors and all I have to say for all of them is that the character arcs for this movie are well performed. Legolas and Gimili expand from minor characters to more front line characters, showing some friendly competition and bonding together, showing how different races can get along I do have to go over the new/reformed characters. Let's start with Gandalf. Gandalf in this movie resurrected and is now Gandalf the White. He's a more stern and authoritative figure. Gone is the wit and charm of Gandalf the Grey. A lot of people didn't criticize the acting of Ian McKellen, who I believed was superb, but the direction of the character. I'm not complaining. He needs to be different in times of war. Moving on to Bernard Hill's Theoden, he gives a fine performance for a character that shows so much pain and guilt of his actions that hurt his people. Karl Urban's Eomer is fine but his character doesn't do much, which is a minor nuance. He also only shows up in the beginning and the end, but it works. Miranda Otto's performance of Eowyn is just fantastic. Otto brings a certain charm and innocence to the character but at the same time could kill you (which is shown in the next movie). David Wenham's Faramir is also well done. The brother of Boromir, he strives to be better than his brother. His character isn't as interesting if you don't watch the extended edition, which explain his backstory. Still, he gives a decent performance, showing the same qualities as Boromir who can be kind, but also can be quite evil and menacing. I don't blame the writers for the liberties they took with the character, who wasn't seduced by the ring. They needed obstacles for Frodo and Sam and that was fine. Moving on to the performance that inspired me, Andy Serkis's Gollum. It's not just the voice, nor the CGI, but his commitment to the character that was great and inspired me. He gives Gollum the childish side, but also the corrupted evil side. All in all, you just feel a lot of pity for Gollum. 
The Battle of Helm's Deep is the climax and is just breathtaking. Tens of thousands of Urks on the big screen is just jaw dropping. The ending of the battle also choked me up, as did Sam's window speech. The music just made the movie ever so grand as it did before. My only problem, low survivors! The original Helm's Deep army had about 600, there were only about 10 left, which sucks! But that's fine.
Let's talk about the themes. First of all, that good can survive. Sam's quote ""That there's still some good in this world Mr. Frodo, and it's worth fighting for."" really resonates with the audience. Whatever bad happens around us, in this case, 10,000 Urks about to wipe out Rohan, good will prevail as long as there's still one good person alive. Another theme is the conclusion of the environmental theme. The first movie shows the vulnerability and the sadness of cutting down the trees. They're cut down to fuel industrialism and raise an army for Sauraman. This movie establishes how the forest now fights back and totally wrecks Isengard. Mother Nature always wins. These themes again, might not be apparent but come up after watching the movie.
 All in all, go watch it. It's one of the best movies out there."
"Jul 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,Thrilling middle part! the part of the invasion by saurog's minions thrills me!!
"Jul 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This is the second movie the the trilogy and the second best. The new character of Gollum is arguably one of the best characters in movie history, with CGI that some movies can't pull off over a decade later. The only problem is that the scenes with Treebeard bring the pacing to a screeching halt. Best scene is the Battle of Helm's Deep."
"Jul 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,(Epic) Review coming soon....
"Jul 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,the two towers continue the greatness there was in the Fellowship of the Ring and has one of the best climaxes i've ever seen.
"Jul 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,GREATEST MOVIE EVER!
"Jul 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The ""least best"" (I can't bear to say worst) of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and still an incredibly good movie."
"Jul 1, 2013",NEUTRAL,The Two Towers gives you action and adventure at its best.
"Jun 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,Blah blah blah hobbits... blah blah dwarves... blah blah elves etc  etc.
"Jun 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"epic, can watch over and over...and i do!!"
"Jun 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"With outstanding performances by Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Andy Serkis, Ian McKellen, and Viggo Mortensen, spectacular visual effects, a outstanding plot, and another well done job by Peter Jackson make The Two Towers the best film of 2002 and the best film in the series and a great adaptation of the second J.R.R Tolkien novel."
"Jun 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,The sequel that lived up to the first. Interesting character development for most of the characters. A+
"Jun 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,Production triumphs.
"Jun 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The shorter of the trilogy, with great battle scenes and effects"
"May 31, 2013",NEUTRAL,"personally my favorite of the trilogy. Two Towers has the perfect balance of action, adventure, and comedy. The tone is serious but there is so much comic relief such as Gollum. Perfect film"
"May 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,All of them are great
"May 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,Truly an amazing movie!
"May 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Peter Jackson really did well on the trilogy and they just get better and better as they progress. Regardless, the second is amazing to watch."
"May 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The second movie of the Lord of the Ring trilogy is also the fastest paced and most adventurous one, surpassing the predecessor in storytelling qualities and having fun with its characters as they and the story had been established with The Fellowship of the Ring episode. Peter Jackson once again uses the groundbreaking special effects to make everything look magical and fantastic, but does not shy away from adding darker undertones that find a personification in the paranoid character of Gollum."
"May 25, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Ya, it's okay I guess"
"May 25, 2013",NEUTRAL,Not the best of the three; the battle at the climax is still one of the greatest ever filmed.
"May 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, kept true to the intrigue in the book and the twists and turns of the plot."
"May 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,Absolute perfection.
"May 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,Maybe the best one of the trilogy. Lostsa Orc violence though.  Was there any backlash from the Orc community?
"May 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This film is my favourite in the series. One of the great things about middle acts is that all the setup has been done for you, and none of the cleanup is going to drag on at the end. It's like coming to a dinner party right as the main course is being served, and leaving before the dishes have to be done. 

The movie does have some exposition of its own. We are introduced to many Rohan characters, as well as some from Gondor. The film's primary villain, Saruman, gets a lot to do here as well. 

It is a little jarring to constantly cut back and forth between Frodo/Sam, Merry/Pippin, and Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli. It does keep the novelty high, but if you're not paying attention, you can forget what each wing of the cast is up to. Be prepared. 

The new additions to the story bring some excellent actors into the film. Andy Serkis, in his breakout role, shows us that physical and voice acting can really sell a character. Bernard Hill is a very human king, Mirando Otto tries really hard (and sometimes succeeds) at showing Ã?owyn's heartache, and Karl Urban is resolute as Ã?omer. 

The movie is quite a thinker of you notice. It raises questions about leadership, integrity, character, and trust. These themes are buried, but fun to discover on your own or with friends, rather than by having some hack of a film review writer tell you about them. 

The Two Towers has action, plot, and a splendid cast of interesting characters. This makes for an extremely enjoyable and suspense-filled film. 

EXTENDED VERSION: This extended cut has more meat to it, with several new scenes, and more elongated scenes. In particular, it accentuates the relationship Boromir and Faramir have with their father (which is very interesting), as well as a bit more about Aragorn and his destiny. It also cleans up a few scenes, which helps with continuity for me."
"May 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,My favourite film of all time. A masterpiece
"May 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,The most favorite movie of all
"May 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,my favorite of the series.
"May 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,incredible and emotional. The Lord Of The Rings The Two Towers is a very good second half of the amazing trilogy.
"May 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,Brilliance at its best.
"May 11, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Not as good as Fellowship of the Ring or Return of the King, but you can't have a beginning or an ending without a middle.  This movie stands very well on it's own."
"May 10, 2013",NEUTRAL,The Trilogy says it all
"May 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,Perfect pick up from the first movie and continued to stun me with the visual representation of Middle Earth
"May 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,Love This Film!!!! The Best Out Of The 3 Films

"May 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,amazing future classic
"May 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,The only watchable part of the trilogy.
"May 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,The movie gives exactly what the audience want: Making them excited for the third movie. And it succeeds in doing that. 9/10
"May 1, 2013",NEUTRAL,"One of the best made wars in movies. Cant give the 5 stars because i read the books. Watch the extended version though, Is way better."
"Apr 26, 2013",NEUTRAL,Amazing.  Epic.  Awesome battles!  Great trilogy.
"Apr 25, 2013",NEUTRAL,Awesome! Even better than the first movie!!

"Apr 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,best of all three movies
"Apr 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!
"Apr 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic! However, Jackson's defamation of the character of Aragorn and Faramir bugged me. Read the books, but still watch the movies. :)"
"Apr 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Love all the LOTR series, and now the 1st Hobbit film as well."
"Apr 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,An awesome movie with great emotion and storytelling. Can't wait to watch the final LOTR film.
"Apr 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,"a great follow up to the fellowship! highlights include helms deep, gollum and the aragorn, gimli and legolas comradery! #AMustWatch"
"Apr 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,The second of the best series ever made!
"Apr 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,This was my favorite of the three movies. I don't know why. It's just great.
"Apr 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,I won't even write about how much I love this trilogy because it would be way to long. Peter Jackson never fails to bring great emotion and a compelling story to the screen it is just the best fantasy can get.
"Apr 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,itz so kwl if u avnt c'n dis ur crazy lmao
"Apr 11, 2013",NEUTRAL,The big mofo battle at the end rocks!
"Apr 11, 2013",NEUTRAL,Not quite as good as The Fellowship of the Ring but still a superb film.
"Apr 9, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Marvellous follow on and true to the book, I couldn't wait for the last film"
"Apr 9, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Gollum is one of the best characters in cinema, the ante is upped, more is at stake and to be reckoned with The Two Towers, an excellent, outstandingly crafted film that continues the first film's excellent quality"
"Apr 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,the extended edition is the best
"Apr 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,It's a movie of epic proportions. With amazing acting and terrific directing.
"Apr 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It might not provide such a compelling story-telling as the first one, but The Two Towers still is a very remarkable and thrilling work, with solid performances by its cast, and leaving you looking forward for Peter Jackson's next masterpiece."
"Apr 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,Who builds a fortres with no escape once inside? Stupid Helm's Deep...
"Apr 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,There is a reason why it's a hundred percent fresh when it's rated by the top critics.
"Apr 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,Another Amazing film
"Apr 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This doesn't really engage on the same level as the first film, probably because of far too much screen time being devoted to Pippin and Merry who almost bear comparison to Jar-Jar Binks in levels of annoyance.  Proceedings are just about redeemed by the epic battle conclusion...but only just."
"Apr 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,Another epic entry in the greatest fantasy film series of all time. Again as like all of these films they are flawlessly acted and directed.
"Apr 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,Couldn't have been more perfect
"Apr 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,"After interned in Emyn Muil, Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee meet the creature Gollum, who tries to remove the ring by force but by being beaten, promises to guide the Hobbits to Mordor. After removing them from Emyn Muil and traverse the Dead Marshes, Morannon arrive at the 'Black Gate' of Mordor.

During the journey, they encounter an advance troop of Gondor led by Faramir, son of the Steward of Gondor and Boromir's brother, who take them as prisoners and discover that carry the One Ring. Faramir decides to bring them to his father but, on its way through the ruined city of Osgiliath Gondorian soldiers are fighting Sauron's forces led by some of Nazgul. Realizing the evil power of the Ring to Frodo, who almost captures one of the Nazgul, Faramir decides to free them to complete their mission.

"Apr 1, 2013",NEUTRAL,A little boring but it ends up with you asking for more.
"Apr 1, 2013",NEUTRAL,Ditto to what I said about LOTR FOTR
"Mar 31, 2013",NEUTRAL,"hate that the elves were killed, but the whole fight is great"
"Mar 31, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The trilogy is a masterpiece, utter perfection."
"Mar 31, 2013",NEUTRAL,The curse of the middle chapter.  Still pretty damned good.
"Mar 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The Fellowship is broken, what are they to do now but make a better sequel!

The Two Towers for me was even better than the Fellowship of the Ring in every way. The cast extended into something even greater. Adding Andy Serkis as the horrible Gollum, brilliant! And one of the best parts, the battle sequences. The Battle of Helm's Deep blew me away.

The Two Towers is one of those rare sequels that improves over the original. I give it 10 out of 10"
"Mar 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A brilliant 2nd part to the trilogy. Scenes show brilliantly the growing relationships between sam and frodo and legolas, gimli and aragorn not only with emotion but with comedy at times.The special effects used through out  and especially in the battle of helms deep are cutting edge and well crafted. Jacksons direction provides an insiteful look into the character of gollum showing his almost schitzophenic nature. Gandalf is reborn and the clear diferences and sililarity between him and his evil counterpart are shown brilliantly to the audience. Amazing!"
"Mar 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Continuing the epic journey, this movie has tons of action in it, and of course great story adaption. If you love these movies, see the extended editions! they are even better."
"Mar 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,Perfect in every way
"Mar 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,"A step up from the previous instalment but also a few steps away from Tolkien's work and closer to the typical action movie framework at the expense of the characters and of the movie itself.

It benefits greatly from not having to introduce itself- the first one did that and it suffered from it. This time the length doesn't feel like an issue because there's more going on but the action gets old after a while and isn't what the spirit of Tolkien's work was about. The Hobbits are also annoyingly outcast as nothing more than bystanders who spend most of the time crawling rather than standing.

It improves on the first in the important areas but then replaces those improvements with some new issues- in both cases it just feels like Jackson is over-playing his hand. The upsides to that though are the thrills, the epicness (yes, it's not a word, boo-hoo) and the stunning visuals that Jackson creates so well. 

I prefer it to the first but I'm left with the same feeling in the end- it could've been better and with less effort too."

"Mar 26, 2013",NEUTRAL,My fave out of the three.  Felt more epic.
"Mar 25, 2013",NEUTRAL,The while trilogy was awesome.
"Mar 25, 2013",NEUTRAL,yeah YYEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
"Mar 25, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Trilogies take the greatest risk with the second chapter--you have neither a definite beginning nor end, so there is a lot more free reign to get really  right or really wrong.  If done right, the payoff is huge; case and point, the Dark Knight, Empire Strikes Back, and the Two Towers.  The movie has action aplenty, but the magic is found in the quieter moments, in Gollum/Smegol's (Oscar worthy and snubbed) schizophrenic discussions to Sam's 'Stories' speech.  The characters' struggles and development are given front stage as the storm clouds gather for the war to decide the fate of Middle Earth.  Add in an Oscar Winning soundtrack introducing the french horn led Rohan theme, gorgeous cinematography in the most beautiful place on earth, and a fantastic cast, and this is a fitting middle chapter to the greatest cinematic fantasy adventure."
"Mar 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,I'm starting to become a fan of lords of the rings I love this movie also the stories are amazing awesome job
"Mar 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,Favorite out of the lord of the rings trilogy. Great battles in this one!
"Mar 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Effects are great, acting is great, but the pace is sooo damn slow I felt like it was a lot longer than the first one."
"Mar 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is a notch below its predecessor in terms of storytelling, adventure and sheer filmmaking, but not in terms of spectacle. There are numerous battle sequences in ""The Two Towers"" that are astonishingly well-made, and it's hard not to find yourself totally enthralled in the action. It's a great film that effectively acts as a connector between the first and third films and the three hour long running time never lags for a single second."
"Mar 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,The Two Towers is a wonderful movie.
"Mar 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,i think The Lord of the Rings the Two Towers is a great movie.
"Feb 26, 2013",NEUTRAL,Best LoTR in my opinion.
"Feb 26, 2013",NEUTRAL,Another awe inspiring Lord of the Rings movie. This movie can be shared by all tastes and likes. I would highly recommend this movie for the entire family.
"Feb 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Great, but not as focused on character development as the first, and left me with a sense of yearning, but I guess this is the middle child of the series that could lead into or out of what ever was learned in the beginning. Maybe more action and less character is justified, but I still feel relatively less satisfied. Overall, it's awe inspiring, especially when considering  --  THAT OPENING SEQUENCE! --"
"Feb 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Full of emotional highs and lows, as well as stunning visuals, this masterpiece leaves you ready for the climax of this epic trilogy."
"Feb 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,I think this one was my favourite.
"Feb 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,Some nice fight scenes more happening than the first.
"Feb 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,Not a Lord of the rings fan at all
"Feb 22, 2013",NEUTRAL,"good but way too long, weakest of the 3"
"Feb 22, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers balances spectacular action with emotional storytelling, leaving audiences both wholly satisfied and eager for the final chapter."
"Feb 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,The battle scenes are awesome. Gandalf is baaackk ;)
"Feb 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,A perfectly balanced film full of action and great storytelling. Serves as a perfect middle-piece for this epic trilogy
"Feb 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,"We wants it, we needs it. Must have the precious. They stole it from us. Sneaky little hobbitses. Wicked, tricksy, false!"
"Feb 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I thought that this was a good film, and I thought Gollum was a pretty cool character."
"Feb 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I found this one boring , first one was very good though"
"Feb 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,My third favorite movie of all time (after the other two LOTR). It is a great continuation of the series and a gorgeous imagining of a beautiful world created by the brilliant J.R.R. Tolkien.
"Feb 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I found Fellowship to be a more enjoyable film as a whole. However, I must say that the addition of the character of Gollum was excellent, and the climax was enjoyable. In the end, though, the pacing issues are still present, and some storylines seem slightly distracting. This film succeeds more on a technical level, as it provides a grander scale than the first film."
"Feb 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,Can Sam keep it together when a homewrecker(Gollum) tries to wiggle his slimy little fingers into his and Frodo's relationship?
"Feb 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" was significantly better than the first installment which isn't   saying much. My low opinion of it is partly influenced by my distaste for these kinds of films, I'll admit that. I am not too fond of a film that is purposely drawn-out, has banal storytelling and characters, except for maybe one or two computer generated ones; Gollum is as fascinating a creature as Dobby was in the ""Harry Potter"" series. It's well written contrary to ""The Fellowship,"" also better acted. Orlando Bloom and Hugo Weaving just look awkward in their respective roles; two characters who do not feel natural in an artificial world. It's only great attributes are everything related to visuals; the computer generated effects are awe-inspiring, especially when the film is coming to an end. I wonder how Peter Jackson and his staff imagined and choreographed all of the detail shown in the battle scenes, even if it was done with a computer. To me, the actual fighting is not interesting at all; it's where these creatures are running to, where they are falling; the several objects used by them, and so on. Some of the shots of locations (castles, and what not) done by CGI are gorgeous to look at, too. As I said earlier most of the characters were unappealing to me, only rarely did I care for a few. I've seen them countless times before and did not like the way they were presented, still I did not expect anything different. The three storylines and what happens in them were mostly predictable, somewhat boring, and not really entertaining. It's style over substance, difficult to catch its pulse."
"Feb 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,Middle-earth gets even bigger and bloodier in the second volume of Peter Jackson's mesmerizing fantasy epic.
"Feb 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Helms Deep was cool,along with some good twists."
"Feb 10, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Very boring watching a random hobbit travel for miles. Other than that, the action was ok in the battles."
"Feb 10, 2013",NEUTRAL,The one time Legolas doesn't hit the guy in between the eyes and what happens... half the castle is blown up.
"Feb 10, 2013",NEUTRAL,Another PHENOMINAL film in the series
"Feb 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Featuring dazzling action sequences and heartfelt, emotional storytelling, The Two Towers is a spectacular installment in the Lord of the Rings trilogy."
"Feb 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Under-rated, the second part was always going to be the diffcult one, being a ""proper"" (i.e. non-constructed) trilogy. But I prefer it to it's brethren. Pacing, effects, acting and (most-importantly) Monsters, ALL better in this film."
"Feb 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,Some films will live on forever as masterpieces. The legacy of the Lord of the Rings films will be the bench mark for fantasy films for years to come.
"Feb 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,"More crafted than the previous one, darker, with a more complex structure, more complicated from the environmental an technical point of view, The Two Towers continues the premise of the first part of the saga, and enlarges its dimension to reach a betterly warlike atmosphere and a gloomy aura that never cuts the emotional and masterful style of Peter Jackson's lucid and wonderful  perfectionism. This film doesn't stay at just keeping the tension and the cinematic brilliantness from the previous film, but it simply denses and polishes it. This one was the hardest to adapt, indeed, because it has too many plots, it has a complex situation, a chaotic and complicated structure, and too many details to be exposed. It was also so hard to express what this story should mean, and to make it both dazzling and thougtfull. Again, Jackson's team made it. Concerning, dramatic, but also evocative and inspiring. This film focuses more on the purely pictorial aspect, on cinematography and score, edition and careness of the environmental atmosphere. Pure Art, in the classical sense. But probably, the greatest things of this film are two: the power of its narrative pulse, and also the introduction of one of the best supporting characters ever: Gollum, both in the psychological and interpretative way, as well as in the digital and creative sense. Every single instant of this classic film, than can be hardly (when not just impossibly) criticized, because of its practical absence of mistakes, is full of the most highly inspired and exquisite artistic taste and sense of heartfulness and beauty. The Greatest Story Ever Told, part II."
"Feb 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,Two Towers is the perfect setup for the final chapter of the trilogy. It is both emotionally packed and action-orientated as well. Simply spectacular.
"Feb 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,def my fave out of all of them.
"Feb 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It picks up right where the other left off. The story is amazing because of all the layers of events taking place. There is also subtle humor sprinkled throughout. 
Again, another amazing film."
"Feb 1, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The middle movie in the trilogy, it was very action packed and very good."
"Jan 31, 2013",NEUTRAL,"After grabbing critical and commercial acclaim to his first installment of his trilogy, Director Peter Jackson moves on to the second film. The Two Towers is excellent, a delight to watch. Andy Serkis's performance added with the CGI make Gollum, a convincing critter, one of the highlights of the film. The battle scenes look amazing on camera and the film amps up the climatic scope to make the movie better than the first and it works! The story follows Frodo and Sam, still on their way to Mordor as they face trials and tribulations of their journey. Meanwhile Aragorn and their former companions wage war on the forces of evil. Arresting, epic entertainment that nicely sets up the grand finale."
"Jan 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,Great action and epic storytelling continue the saga of LOTR.
"Jan 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Definitely, the best epic series of all time., J.R.R. Tolkien is unparalleled to this kind of literature.., I wish he is still alive to continue the story.., The way the movie was created was amazing., I admire those who became part in the making of this film.,"
"Jan 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,"What used to be my least favorite of the fantastic Lord of the Rings series has gotten better with every rewatch. Two Towers is a fantastic movie in every sense of the word, and I can finally say it beats Fellowship. This movie continues the great story and develops the characters even more. The acting becomes increasingly better, with not only the returning standouts Wood, McKellen, and Mortensen, but now with new standouts: Astin, Tyler, and most certainly Andy Serkis. Serkis's portrayal of Gollum is one of the best motion-capture performances ever, and deserves the Oscar it never got nominated for. The movie is amazingly paced, and is surprisingly more entertaining than Fellowship. It is funnier, more emotional, has even BETTER music, and features one of the best battles in any movie I have ever seen: Helms Deep. Two Towers improves on its predecessor in every way, and sets up a finale that no one could be prepared for. 9.5/10"
"Jan 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,A great tie in movie.
"Jan 26, 2013",NEUTRAL,"What else can I say about this film other than that it it is visually stunning, engaging and astounding? Everything there is to be said about this flick has probably been stated or though, so that's really all I have to say about this one."
"Jan 26, 2013",NEUTRAL,My least favorite of the three. Pretty Good.
"Jan 25, 2013",NEUTRAL,special effects are awesome.  story is not my interest.
"Jan 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The second chapter LOTR is deeper and darker than the previous. While the first film started off on a lighter note, The world of The Two Towers is entirely immersed in the War of the Ring, the fellowship has broken up, and Sauron's power is growing across Middle Earth. The film is more complicated than the first, with more subplots relating to the war shown. Frodo and Sam's journey with Gollum is a highlight, and their unique relationship is captured masterfully. The mood of the film is great, the emotion present, and the victories at Helm's Deep and Isengard set up the final push against Sauron and Mordor in ROTK"
"Jan 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Peter Jackson's second venture into middle earth musters up an air of escalating dread and impending destiny, before closing on a battle of colossal scale. Tolkien's beloved characters are explored in greater depth and Jackson treads very carefully alongside the source material, offering fans another franchise instalment that's as faithful as it is entertaining. Mega-budget epic with groundbreaking CGI that made Andy Serkis' schizophrenic Smeagol a cinematic landmark."
"Jan 23, 2013",NEUTRAL,MOre imagination and action than the first film. It also has deeper emotion and does great on preparing for the final chapter. 7.9/10
"Jan 22, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Weak-as-hell middle section to the whole story. Poor pacing, lackluster fights, and not enough Gollum = Two Towers. Obviously you have to see this movie to get the whole story, but... It could have been way better."
"Jan 22, 2013",NEUTRAL,A fitting go-between in what turned out to be an epic trilogy.
"Jan 22, 2013",NEUTRAL,Weakest of the trilogy. The extended version is why it gets 3 stars instead of 2. Avoid the theatrical cut at all costs!
"Jan 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,The 2nd chapter in the LOTR Trilogy. Great sequel not much to be critical over.
"Jan 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,a darker chapter of the trilogy. very creative and nice effects.
"Jan 21, 2013",NEUTRAL,best of the bunch for me.  lots of fun action.
"Jan 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,Trilogy bored me to death
"Jan 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,AWESOME I LOVE ELIJAH AND VIGGO
"Jan 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,The Fellowship is scattered. Frodo and Sam are being lead to Mount Doom by a crazy skinned Hobbit named Gollum. What else would happen now? Nothing. The second novel to Tolkien's great fantasy is yet to be revealed. But what now? Wait 'till you see more!
"Jan 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,Greatest series to date!
"Jan 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Long, drawn out, mostly boring. Here's the story - a lot of death, a lot of waiting for death and a lot of dying. The only enjoyment was making fun of the names froyo dumbledor, doppy. I should have just turned it off."
"Jan 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,good rep of the book
"Jan 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Again, too good to be true"
"Jan 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,Kind of long and dull if you are not a huge Lord of the Rings fan. But it's still pretty good.
"Jan 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,The second part to the trilogy. I really loved this film great special effects it kept to the storyline in the book quite well and the cast acting was really good. Its not for everybody but if you are a fan of the book I would recommend it to you if you havent seen it.
"Jan 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,Excellent! By far the best in the trilogy and very captivating
"Jan 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,Ian mcellan was great as gandalf great cast and solid director
"Jan 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,Helm's Deep battle is awsome
"Jan 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,"There's no doubt about it that this film is a bridge between Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King. I'm not usually not the biggest fan of bridge stories since all they do is just set up the finale without adding anything new. For example, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix's only purpose is to prove that Voldemort is back and to set up the final battle, making this the worst of the Harry Potter series. However, The Two Towers is completely different from most bridge stories. The film continues where Fellowship of the Ring left off with the Fellowship broken up and Sauron beginning his attack on Middle-Earth. Frodo and Sam are lost on their way to Mordor and ask Gollum/Smeagol to guide them. Merry and Pippin have escaped their captors and are kept safe by Treegard, a talking tree that is the eldest of his kind. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are assisting a town under attack by Orcs at their fortress in Helm's Pass. While all of this is occurring, Sauron is growing stronger with the ring approaching closer. I thought that Two Towers was an improvement over Fellowship. Unlike Fellowship, while it does have a long length, I was able to keep my interest the entire time with clever dialogue and a smartly written script. There's not many action scenes in this film, so the story relies on the dialogue to establish characters and set-up what will occur in the Return of the King. The character that shines the most in this film is Gollum. This is the first time in the series that he's seen entirely. Every scene that he was in, I was clinging to his every world. Andy Serkis does a great job portraying the character and the ending shows that there will be a lot more of him that could be just as exciting as in this film. I'm glad that I was able to finally see this film because it just leaves me, as well as newcomers and fans of the series, in anticipation for Return of the King and the epic conclusion."
"Jan 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,I actually slept though the middle of this one.
"Jan 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,What more can I say... Excellent cast again etc. etc.
"Jan 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Once again the fight scene at the end steals the show, liked the comedy too with the little dwarf guy having some funny lines."
"Jan 11, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Second of the trilogy, this film is an example of how interesting a film can be made in between a predecessor and a successor."
"Jan 11, 2013",NEUTRAL,this is a brilliant addition to lotr it kept me watching. I can't wait til I see the hobbit.
"Jan 10, 2013",NEUTRAL,i freakin love this film
"Jan 10, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Ok. The first time I saw ""The Lord of the rings"" (first one) I was like:'Doesn't this movie ever end!' So I never really watched the whole of ""The feelowship of the ring"" But ""The two towers"" I've seen and watched the whole of it (probably cos it was the ending of the story-I always like to know how stories end)"
"Jan 9, 2013",NEUTRAL,Amazing... Visually stunning and extremely well-done overall. No complaints.
"Jan 9, 2013",NEUTRAL,Favorite one of the trilogy. Battle of Helm's Deep combined with the music just gives you chills & the depth & emotion that went into a scene like that.
"Jan 9, 2013",NEUTRAL,I think this is the weakest movie in the trilogy. Though i don't really love the LOTR movies anyway
"Jan 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,Peter Jackson knows what he is doing behind the camera
"Jan 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,tHIS MOVIE IS A GREAT SEQUEL AND IT HAS ALOT OF ACTION BUT GOLLUM CAN CONFUSE ME.
"Jan 8, 2013",NEUTRAL,"No major introductions, just brutal battles and visually satisfying wonders await the audience."
"Jan 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,http://www.ryanhawbecker.com/2012/12/the-lord-of-rings-two-towers-movie.html?spref=tw â¦
"Jan 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The captivating thing about Two Towers is the fight choreography and the battle at Helmâ(TM)s Deep (which was kind of the movieâ(TM)s climax), it is one that you will not forget that easily and the movie is just another powerful extension of what Peter Jackson could do, the movie is filled with a lot more CGI (from my view) than the first, and it may not be the best of the three, but Two Towers delivered some powerful performances, especially from Aragon (Viggo Mortensen), the Dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the Elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom).

After you have watched The Fellowship of the Rings, you are ever so eager to see what the Fellowship, (which is now broken into three groups Frodo with Sam, Pippin with Merry and Aragon with Legolas and Gimli) will be able to achieve on their own, as part of the master plan to destroy the ring at Mount Doom. The interesting thing about watching this flick is that some managed victory in their own areas, giving you the viewer a delightful hope, while Frodo (Elijah Woods) and Sam (Sean Astin) were moving closer to their target.

The movieâ(TM)s plot is focused mostly on the battle at Helmâ(TM)s Deep. The other fellowship members except Frodo and Sam and after the fall of Gandalf when he battled the Balrog, chased after the Uruk-hai who took Merry and Pippin so as to rescue them. While they chased Merry and Pippin found an adventure of their own in the forest. The rescuers Aragon, Gimli and Legolas found themselves in Rohan and had to save the king and defend the city from an attack from Sarumanâ(TM)s forces, this defense and intense battle happened at Helmâ(TM)s Deep.

The three most notable changes in the movie compared to the book that I picked up instantly are (although many other differences can be found) 1. In the book Theoden is just depressed and deluded by Wormtongue but in the movie he is possessed by Saruman. The second is about Theeoden, who didnâ(TM)t just run to Helmâ(TM)s Deep as the movie made it see, he actually fought at first. The last was the exclusion of Shelob, who was later included in the final movie of the trilogy.

Not winning as much as the first, Two Towers won two Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best sound Editing. It was a commercial success making close to 10 times its 94 million dollars production cost.
Not as much of a powerful score like The Fellowship of the Ring the movie is a nice follow up to the first, and it served like a bridge from an excellent beginning in the trilogy (in the fellowship of the ring) to a magnificent ending (in the Return of the King). You canâ(TM)t watch the first only without seeing this also, so get the DVD box set and enjoy.

"Jan 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,Most tedious of the three but still good.
"Jan 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,Loved this movie! Helped me find my favourite army. The Uruk-Hai!!
"Jan 1, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It is often said that this book is the unimportant, boring, and unnecessary middle ground, which I have always disagreed with.  Peter Jackson saw the beauty of this book like I did and made it even more.  And the Helms Deep battle has changed battle scenes for the entire future of movie history."
"Dec 31, 2012",NEUTRAL,Enjoyable and on par with the first movie.
"Dec 31, 2012",NEUTRAL,I thought they were all great!
"Dec 31, 2012",NEUTRAL,this again was ok but not the best
"Dec 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,Wow! What a well done series with fabulous special effects.
"Dec 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,It's cool to see three stories at once which makes it that epic.
"Dec 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Sorry, but this is too much for me."
"Dec 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Not quite as good as Fellowship, but it's still incredible."
"Dec 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,"More of the same. Like I say, read the books FIRST if possible, otherwise stay away."
"Dec 29, 2012",NEUTRAL,I think that this is possibly the best movie of the best movie series so this is basically saying that this movie it fantastic.
"Dec 29, 2012",NEUTRAL,I think that this is possibly the best movie of the best movie series so this is basically saying that this movie it fantastic.
"Dec 29, 2012",NEUTRAL,The least of the three movies(I can't in good conscience call it the worst) but it's still a freakin great movie.  Helms Deep is awesome.  The march of the Ents is cool.  And Gollum is amazing.
"Dec 29, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Another three hours that went by in a whiff. Again I'm astonished as to how well this fits in with the way I had envisioned this tale visually. Now for the third instalment, and then maybe the extended versions just for hood measure..."
"Dec 29, 2012",NEUTRAL,"""the two towers"" is my favorite in the LOTR series. a lot of humor, epic battle scenes, and fantastic performances, especially from andy serkis as gollum."
"Dec 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,It would have been excellent but for the meandering storyline and the dragging and repetitive battle scenes.
"Dec 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,"""Throw me...don't tell the elf.""

It could've been the worst of the 3 - being the middle it has no start and no end so there's no conclusion. But no, it's easily my favourite of the trilogy progressing the story nicely and introducing more characters and creating more of a character of 'Gollum'. 

There's a greater sense of size and epicness of the world in 'The Two Towers' its done on a grander scale - probably due to the success of the first film. There's more of the world to see and a larger emphasis on the task 'Frodo' and the gang are up against. It also contains what I consider to be the greatest battle scene of all time - 'The Battle for Helms Deep'. That last hour is a magnificent feat in film making.

Whereas 'The Fellowship of The Ring' was relatively dark and miserable throughout, 'The Two Towers' as a happier ending and is the part that shows that there is hope and they finally believe they can accomplish the task. There's a greater feeling of togetherness throughout then film 'Legolass' and 'Gimli' start to become friends. The king of 'Rohan' is returned to the crown and 'Gandalf' returns. Despite the appearance of what some perceive to be a darker film it is not it's quite the opposite.

Unlike then previous film the 3 running time for 'The Two Towers' works perfectly it doesn't drag, everything is necessary. The CGI is clearly improved and considering its only 1 year later it's quite remarkable. 

An improvement in every way on the previous film a greater emphasis on the world and an all together brighter and happier outlook on what they're facing - and containing the greatest battle scene I've ever seen. This really is the 'Empire Strikes Back' of 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy."
"Dec 27, 2012",NEUTRAL,Best movie ever. Period.
"Dec 27, 2012",NEUTRAL,I feel that this one is the best out of the 3 lord of the rings films. Great fight scene and the graphics/special effects were outstanding.
"Dec 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,One of the best films of all time. Nuff' Said.
"Dec 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Epic movie with a good continuing story, we meet some new allies and enemies and the same amazing cast and music."
"Dec 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,the 2 towers was a beautiful transition from the Fellowship of the Ring to the return of the king
"Dec 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Even better than Fellowship, the Two towers incorporates amazing action and spectacular storytelling. The battle of Helms Deep for example is an epic battle scene and one of the best I've ever seen. Viggo Mortensen plays a believable Aragorn, while Orlando Bloom plays a cool Legolas. We also meet Gollum, who brings interest and spectacular acting by Andy Serkis."
"Dec 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,"the best of the series. the team of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli is probably one of the most badass group of characters ever. hunting some mother fuckin orc"
"Dec 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Even though this is my least favorite part of the trilogy, The Two Towers is by no means weak at all.  Amazing battle scenes and the various subplots (Rohan being my favorite) add to the intensity."
"Dec 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,"THIS MOVIE WAS FRICKING AMAZING!!!!!!
And the battle of Helms Deep was awesome"
"Dec 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,Awesome movie. One of the best trilogies of all time!!
"Dec 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Further into Middle Earth and closer to Mordor, Peter Jackson's second installment continues right where the first chapter left off. It is essential to keep up with this movie as the members of 'the Fellowship' are split up across the lands, leading to many storylines and the introduction of many new characters. Elijah Wood once again plays Frodo (as he and Sam attempt to complete their journey), Viggo Mortensen excellently plays Aragorn (heir to the throne of Gondor), but it is the character of Gollum that steals the show (as well as trying to steal the Ring!). Glimpses of the creature were seen in the opening movie, but here the audience really get to know the character through a brilliant performance from Andy Serkis and the help of incredible CGI. The movie climaxes at the Battle of Helm's Deep, with every attention to detail present as thousands of Sarumen's minions descend upon the fortress. But the story is not over yet as Gollum leads the Hobbits towards Mordor..."
"Dec 11, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Another masterpiece by Peter Jackson. Once-again, the harmony of the photographic and audio-related elements completely surprised me. Quite simply, nothing imperfect about this film or the one before it.

Most justified critique: I love the Lord of the Rings."
"Dec 11, 2012",NEUTRAL,CANT GET ENOUGH OF THIS;;
"Dec 10, 2012",NEUTRAL,not brilliant but acceptable
"Dec 10, 2012",NEUTRAL,My favorite of the trilogy
"Dec 9, 2012",NEUTRAL,A brilliantly crafted film and perfectly executed installment in the franchise. Classic.
"Dec 9, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Its hard to write a review when you've only seen the unedited, incredibly too long version of the movie so I wont even try.  However, its effects and action is well done."
"Dec 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic film! Finally saw the entire LOTR trilogy!
Really enjoyed this film."
"Dec 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,Excellent. The mother of all fantasy adventures and the inspiration of a million wannabees.
"Dec 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,"It may be the calm before the storm, but The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers brings all that you love from Middle-Earth, in terms of acting, story, scope, ambitious action, and imaginative characters, while adding new plot lines and adding more to the scene.

Verdict: Epically Awesome!!"
"Dec 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The pacing isn't as good as the first one, but that cannot overshadow everything else in the movie."
"Dec 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,Sets up for the epic conclusion of the trilogy.
"Nov 9, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Like the other films in the franchise, The Two Towers is a staggeringly ambitious accomplishment. With the introductory material out of the way, Jackson makes room for massive action sequence after massive action sequence, fitting moments for character development in the spaces between them. Here characters are resurrected, tree people drown goblins, and elves slide down stairs on shields while firing arrows at enemies, but there's also quite a bit of to be said about the universal truths that come through the various storylines (the importance of perseverance, the small making a difference, etc.). It's impressive just how much Jackson gets across about these characters and environments with small details, a ripped flag pointing to the devolution of a once-great city, etc. It more than works as the middle-chapter of the trilogy, delivering spectacle and heart in equal measure, keeping the momentum going as the story continues on into the last (and best) entry in the series."
"Nov 9, 2012",NEUTRAL,Lord of the rings is awesome and this one is the best of the 3!
"Nov 9, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The best Lord of The Rings film, by quite a way. Deep emotion is blended with superb action sequences and brilliant acting. It would be an understatement to call this film spectacular. If anything, the battle at Helms Deep towards the climax deserves an Oscar on it's own."
"Nov 7, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Expanding on the mounting tension of the first film, Two Towers hits home with an absolutely rousing build and climax."
"Nov 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,"This one to me was quite pointless... hear me out... nothing particularly happens other than Gollum joining the gang, but really you could skip this movie and go to the third and not miss A THING. The only reason to watch this is the battle of Helms Deep."
"Nov 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,Even more action packed middle installment to this epic quest.
"Nov 5, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Again, I loved it, but I have to say my favorite part of the movie is the credits just for the song. I don't know why, but it's creepy and amazing."
"Nov 4, 2012",NEUTRAL,The greatest in a group of fantastic films.
"Nov 4, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Better, but still a little overrated."
"Nov 4, 2012",NEUTRAL,"""They are all one movie!"" -anon"
"Nov 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,Equally as good as the first
"Nov 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,Do I even need to say why?
"Nov 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,"A masterful continuation of the epic tale of the Fellowship of the Ring, and the continuation of the best movie trilogy ever.  All of the returning characters still amaze and bring out new depth in the story and the new characters are superbly crafted."
"Nov 1, 2012",NEUTRAL,Part 2 and wonderful as well... The saga continues..
"Nov 1, 2012",NEUTRAL,"A film with all my favorites within the realms of a typical Dungeon and Dragons Role Playing Game... throw in some lovely battle scenes and Frodo's quest of tossing that ""oh so valuable"" ring... can't go wrong!"
"Oct 31, 2012",NEUTRAL,as i said i love lord of the rings.
"Oct 31, 2012",NEUTRAL,My favorite movie of all time! Easily the best of the three.
"Oct 31, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Epic in size, scale, quality and entertainment"
"Oct 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,"It did not develop the story or characters, just merely added a chapter to what is already a repetitive story."
"Oct 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Because Treebeard and Faramir. Also Arwen, elves at Helm's Deep, skateboarding Legolas and ""43!"""
"Oct 29, 2012",NEUTRAL,PUTT ME IN STICHES BECAUSE I LOVED IT SOOOOOOOOO MUCH
"Oct 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,"oh! aki no hay detalles porque seguro todos saben, es un clasico."
"Oct 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Even better than the first! yet another outstanding piece of film making by peter jackson. The great thing about the second installment is the way you are constantly thrown from story to story. If you get bored of one fight (asif that where possible) there is something else going on in middle earth that will tickle you fancy. If you havn't seen this you need to watch it. Infact stop everything and watch them all. same as before 10 out of 10. These movies are historical gems.

10?10"
"Oct 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,The story is the best ever... the movie is good!
"Oct 27, 2012",NEUTRAL,If you seen one you see them all. How could you not?
"Oct 26, 2012",NEUTRAL,There are only few films that manage to adapt so well from the books like Lord of the Rings have done
"Oct 25, 2012",NEUTRAL,Watching this brings back movie nights with the tonic gang!
"Oct 23, 2012",NEUTRAL,This second entry into the franchise goes to the next level with plenty to talk about!  The story is just as good as the first and a little more action took it to the next level!
"Oct 23, 2012",NEUTRAL,another movie about walking great story tho
"Oct 22, 2012",NEUTRAL,"I've watched it long time ago, when I was just a kid. At the time it was just another movie with orcs, humans, elves and some other creatures fighting, but some months ago I watched it again... it just changed. When you are grown up enough, you see it as one of the best trilogy ever made."
"Oct 22, 2012",NEUTRAL,Nice adaptation. I would have liked to have seen a little more of the rest of the story. Maybe a hobbit?
"Oct 20, 2012",NEUTRAL,The worst Lord of the Rings.. But that doesn't mean it's bad
"Oct 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,Very good middle movie bridging the gap from the epic first movie and the great last movie of this tremendous trilogy. It kind of drags in the middle but it does what it's supposed to do as an in between movie. The extended cut adds a lot that was left off but if you never watch that version you will be okay.
"Oct 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,Bladder burtingly epic.
"Oct 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Completely avoids ""the difficult second album"" syndrome...marvellous, beautiful film!"
"Oct 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Helms Deep scene is amazing, but don't remember much else. think the series is extremely overrated"
"Oct 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,"With the characters and plot already set, the story manages to get underway faster. But ultimately it's ending is snubbed to make way for the final chapter"
"Oct 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,the only film that competes with 'the return of the king'! brilliant sequel and plot! the longer the movie the better! (the extended version is 4 hours 30 min.)
"Oct 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,A little off but otherwise great
"Oct 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,Good Movie series...
"Oct 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,Very good storyline :) Love how this kept you going. Was trying my hardest to follow along.
"Oct 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,LOOOOOOONG. Good movie but too long.
"Oct 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The second chapter of the Lord of the Rings is a sight to behold. It really is something that is both emotionally and critically satisfying. The story continues and it's awesome! The pacing is pitch perfect, never getting boring for a three hour film. It fells like it needs more than to be cut down. Even the near 4 hour version feels short. The film has a very good message which I won't spoil for you. The acting is perfect and the Helms Deep battle scene is so amazing it can leave your jaw literally dropping. Although all the technical wizdary is amazing, it is the heart of the story that truly matters. It's a story that will make you laugh and cry. It's something that will leave an impression on you for a long while. This is really Aragorns film and shows what he has to struggle with in following his path to kingship instead of following Frodo. The struggle he goes through is felt along with Frodo and everyone else. Each one has a struggle. Frodo and Sam having to deal with whether or not they should trust a creature Gollum to lead them to Mordor. Who by the way is played wonderfully by Andy Serkis. Merry and Pippin who want to help in a war that us way too big for them but not for a certain creature they befriend. Aragorn and company also struggle with the coming battle. The tension is amazingly raised. If there is one negative aspect is that it ends and have to wait to see the finale to see hoe everything ties up. Then again that's the beauty of a series like this. To leave you anticipating the next chapter innate great story.  Its all powerful stuff. The strong message that I can give away is the one of hope over evil. It's a strong one and leaves me anxiously waiting to watch The Return of the King."
"Oct 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,"A slight step-up from the already pretty good TFOFTR, Two Towers spends much of its time in the world of the humans/elves within Middle Earth...this, however is its main problem, getting bogged down in boring characters we don't even know. However, its strengths are quite strong. The editing between the storylines (Gollum/Sam/Frodo, Tree-beard/Merry/Pippin, Aragorn/Gimle/Legolas) flows smoothly, the emotions are more palpable, and the Battle at Helms Deep is one for the ages. A visually impressive, sweeping epic that carries the middle act of the trilogy fairly nicely."
"Oct 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,dont like trilogy of lord of the ring
"Oct 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,Great movie this and the thrid one will be a tough battle to win my vote for the best LOTR
"Oct 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Like its predecessor, this is a perfect fantasy film in every way. This time there is more action and more suspense. I was engaged from start to finish, because I never found this film to be boring whatsoever. This sequel is a classic in every way that it can be. There are no weak points, to say the least."
"Oct 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,"God, all Lord of the Rings are amazing, although I think this is my most favorite."
"Oct 10, 2012",NEUTRAL,Incredible movie!!!!
"Oct 10, 2012",NEUTRAL,"More development than 'Fellowship', less action than 'Return of the King', but effectively tethers the two together and leave you craving more. A perfect middle to a trilogy."
"Oct 9, 2012",NEUTRAL,This was an awesome movie but I will admit perhaps not as good as the first now that I watch it from the lense I see now
"Oct 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Perfect, thats the word to use. Such a awe inspiring movie. 5/5 for graphics 5/5 for acting 5/5 for length 5/5 overall. This movie brought it and if you dont like it, you probablly dont like medieval times and perfect imagination."
"Oct 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,My personal favorite out of the whole trilogy
"Oct 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,thought the triligy was shite at the cinema however at home watching again they were GREAT
"Oct 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers does not acheive the unique majesty of the Fellowship of the Ring, but it might have a more memorable sequence than anything seen in the first movie: the Battle of Helm's Deep. Sequels take two routes. The Empire Strikes Back route elevates the Trilogy to new heights with a more complex story, or the Die Hard route crafts a fun picture but ultimately acts as a retread of the first movie. While overall LOTR: The Two Towers falls toward the latter, it has enough character development and story progression to only slightly have it below the first movie. Plus The Two Towers builds to what will be one of the greatest war sequences in cinematic history: the Battle of Helm's Deep. By revolving the story around its battle masterpiece, LOTR: The Two Towers avoids becoming the forgotten movie in the Trilogy and successfully sets up the finale, the Return of the King.

The Two Towers begins where the Fellowship ends: with the sundering of the fellowship. The story splits into 3 parts. Gandalf (Ian McKellen) did not perish from his fall in Moria, but has battled the Balrog he fought in the Fellowship and transformed into Gandalf the White. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) chase the orcs that captured Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) and are returning them to Saruman (Christopher Lee), who believes they have the ring. Their chase takes them through the man-inhabited country of Rohan, run by King Theoden (Bernard Hill), his right-hand man Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), and his niece Eowyn (Miranda Otto) and nephew Eomer (Karl Urban). Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), are lost in the labyrinth of mountains they entered at the end of the Fellowship. To get out, the receive the services of Gollum (Andy Serkis), the previous ring owner, who is cursed with multiple personalities and will stop at nothing to reunite with the ring. However, Gollum has also been to Mordor, so Frodo and Sam need him to guide them to Mordor so they can complete their quest.

The special effects take a big jump in The Two Towers, and not just Helm's Deep (which I will get to), but on a more intimate level. It is shocking to think that Gollum does not exist; apparently Andy Serkis was placed into a motion capture suit, so much credit goes to Serkis and the CGI for not only giving Gollum realistic movements, but for crafting a character with easily discernible personalities. 

But the piece de resistance of LOTR: The Two Towers is the 45 minute Battle of Helm's Deep, where Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Theoden have to defend the people of Rohan from the attacking orcs of Saruman. Apparently the battle was mostly shot in CGI, giving each of the thousands of participants a little memory to choose a fight at random, making the battle sequences believeable. The battle encapsulates the many aspects of a war: the tension filled-preparation, the eerie calm before the start of the battle, explosions, and individual heroism. By using a pan-over filming approach as well as gigantic walls for the orcs to climb over, the battle's grandeur is elevated to Shakespearean levels. All credit goes to the combined efforts of the special effects, art, sound, makeup, and acting departments. 

The cinematography department also deserves credit for using New Zealand to distinguish the various lands  where these adventures are taking place. Is is easy to distinguish the locations from one another: Rohan's rolling hills, the bog Sam and Frodo have to go through, Rivendell's waterfalls, and many other locations. Edoras, the Rohan capital, is described as a hill in front of mountains, which took months for the cinematographers to find the right spot. The detail and specificity is not lost on the viewer and provides a stunning backdrop for the character's traversing.

The acting is solid across the board. Serkis shines because of the parallel between his Gollum and Elijah Wood's Frodo, who becomes more weary and paranoid because of the ring's effects. With Gandalf more in the background in this movie, Viggo Mortensen gets to display more acting chops as his Aragorn has to ascend to the importance of his birthright. The newcomers also bring something to the table: Karl Urban shows youthful loyalty and fire, Miranda Otto provides a strong female character needed in the story, Bernard Hill exudes royalty, David Wenham gives Faramir, Boromir's brother, self-assuredness and wisdom, and Brad Dourif reeks of deception. 

As exhausted as the characters and myself were after the Battle of Helm's Deep, the Two Towers acknowledges that even more is yet to come. The Two Towers successfully elevates the setup from the Fellowship of the Ring by raising the stakes for the characters as they come closer to their fates. Who would think that hobbits, elves, dwarves, and wizards could illicit such enthusiasm and emotional catharsis?"
"Oct 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,Awesome movie with awesome visual effects and sound; it blew my mind. Its a must watch.
"Oct 5, 2012",NEUTRAL,Without question the best middle part of a trilogy since Empire Strikes Back. This film not only continues and expands upon the promise of the first film but sets the stage masterfully for the final act. The best film of the trilogy.
"Oct 4, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Stereotypically the ""middle child"" is the underachiever, but in this instance it surpasses the expectations of a sequel."
"Oct 4, 2012",NEUTRAL,The Two Towers stand tall!
"Oct 4, 2012",NEUTRAL,good i liked all of them
"Oct 4, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers is everything the first movie is and more. It has good character development, excellent visual effects, and now add top notch action to the mix. An epic tale that leaves all its viewers itching to watch the final chapter."
"Oct 4, 2012",NEUTRAL,Slower paced but as a result more emotionally satisfying and dramatically rewarding.
"Oct 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,"While not as amazing as the first one, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers has well balanced spectacular action with great emotional storytelling and the acting is as good as ever. The story is getting more intense now and the battle was as fierce as ever. I guess the only thing i disliked is that the story ends where it starts, with Samwise and Frodo alone with Gollum now, but it doesen't even really matter cause that's key to the story and it'll be interesting to see what they do from here. Spectacular and full of great special effects, costume and makeup to ensure that the sorcery atmosphere has been set up really well"
"Oct 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Though it is at the very most only similar to the book, this movie dared to stray from the path written by J.R.R. Tolkien and benefited greatly from it.  Great movie."
"Oct 2, 2012",NEUTRAL,Same as here been pretty good busy movie ppl has cool
"Oct 1, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The best of the trilogy, IMO."
"Sep 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,Not better than the other two but it is really good
"Sep 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,"La falta de ritmo y el planteamiento de las historias paralelas la hacen la mas floja de las 3, y aqui es donde la adaptacion del libro flojea demasiado. Eso no quita que tenga mucho bueno que ofrecer al espectador, pero palidece ante la primera entrega."
"Sep 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,Peca um pouco em comparaÃ§Ã£o aos outros dois. Com cortes inexplicados e os momentos com o Barba da Ã?rvore.
"Sep 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,"An epic, on all proportions. It doesn't get much better than this. Action, romance and stroy combine. A must see movie."
"Sep 27, 2012",NEUTRAL,Divides its time between amazing special effects and heartfelt and emotional storytelling to incredible effect
"Sep 27, 2012",NEUTRAL,too good for words...expect these ones :|
"Sep 26, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, amazingly well done trilogy."
"Sep 25, 2012",NEUTRAL,"We tread slightly less interesting ground once we enter Rohan, but the film overall is still as wildly ambitious and epic as the first installment."
"Sep 25, 2012",NEUTRAL,Another of my favorites!
"Sep 24, 2012",NEUTRAL,Absolutely fantastic. One of the best movies ever and has one of the best battle sequences ever. Definitely my favourite of The Lord of The Rings Trilogy.
"Sep 24, 2012",NEUTRAL,zzzzzzz zzzzzzz zzzzzzz
"Sep 23, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Esta movie obtuvo once nominaciones al Oscar en el 2003 y gano las once. Esta pelicula junto con Titanic (1997)  y Ben-Hur (1959) son las tres movie ganadoras de once premios al Oscar, en su respectivos a~no."
"Sep 23, 2012",NEUTRAL,The second masterpiece of the best trilogy of all time.
"Sep 23, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Although I have seen all of the Lord of the Rings films before, I had never read the books, and so recently I decided to read them. I then thought it might be fun to watch each film as I complete each part of the story. And so, having finished â~The Two Towersâ(TM)â¦ and read the first eighty or so pages or so of â~The Return of the Kingâ(TM) we come to the second of Peter Jacksonâ(TM)s films. For the record I have to say that I watched the extended version, available on DVD and Blu Ray.

NOTE: There may be spoilers in here; if you havenâ(TM)t seen the â~Fellowship of the Ringâ(TM) please skip this paragraph.

With the Fellowship broken at the end of the first film we follow the fortunes of the remaining adventurers. Frodo and Sam are to make their own way to Mordor, but not without a little help from an unexpected quarter. Gollum has been following them and now he finds himself aiding them on their quest; but can he be trusted? Sam certainly thinks not. Meanwhile Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are on the trail of Merry and Pippin who had been taken by a band of Orcs towards Isengard, the stronghold of the wizard Saruman, a follower of Sauron. The Orcs had been attacked by a band of horsemen from Rohan but the Hobbits escaped into the forest. Here they meet an Ent called Treebeard and he takes them to a gathering of all the Ents in the wood. Following them, the other three are surprised to be met by Gandalf who they thought had perished in the mines of Moria. From here on it begins to get a little complicated but needless say there are battles to be won as the war for Middle Earth hots up.

Peter Jackson and his team did not disappoint again, another epic film with tremendous scope. I also have to mention again the original music by Howard Shore; another great score with some really great themes. As far as performances go, well everybody did a great job but those that stood out (for me) were; Elijah Wood as Frodo, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Sean Astin as Samwise â~Samâ(TM) Gamgee, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Bernard Hill as Theodin (King of Rohan). Also worthy of note were; Billy Boyd as Pippin, Dominic Monaghan as Merry, Orlando Bloom as Legolas, John Rhys-Davies as Gimli/Voice of Treebeard, Liv Tyler as Arwen, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, David Wenham as Faramir,  Christopher Lee as Saruman, Karl Urban as Eomer and not forgetting Andy Serkis as Gollum/Smeagol.

Having recently read the book I did find that this departed from J.R.R.Tolkienâ(TM)s original to a much larger extent than the first instalment â~The Fellowship of the Ringâ(TM). Much more is put into establishing background and motive than in the text and, to a large extent, it works pretty well. It does, however, distract from the task at hand in places and I did find it a little heavy going here and there. I canâ(TM)t, on the other hand, fault the production; it is all brilliantly brought together and it looks fantastic! The battle scenes are immense and to be admired. Itâ(TM)s certainly one, despite a couple of misgivings, I still rate very highly.

SteelMonsterâ(TM)s verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

My score: 9.1/10"
"Sep 22, 2012",NEUTRAL,it was a good story and it picks up right where the last one ends. its long but still very good
"Sep 22, 2012",NEUTRAL,Enjoyed it even more the second time watching it.
"Sep 22, 2012",NEUTRAL,I stil like the last movie best it is my all time favorite of the three but this is one i also really liked before the third came out it has alot of funny parts in it with Gimili and Legolas those are the best parts...well and the march of the Ents but i still really like it.
"Sep 21, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Following the beautiful beginning to the trilogy, Peter Jackson delivers a darker and a more bad-ass sequel."
"Sep 20, 2012",NEUTRAL,Well...the Balrog sequence was cool.
"Sep 20, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers builds on the story of its predecessor and follows in its footsteps with the same elements that made the first one great. With the addition of Gollum and the masterfully constructed battle scenes, it becomes even more enjoyable and compelling."
"Sep 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,The Battle for Helms Deep remains one of the great fantasy battles ever seen on screen.
"Sep 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,I guess I was wrong... The Two Towers is as great as the fist one...
"Sep 18, 2012",NEUTRAL,**you need to watch the first and last film of this trilogy before and after watching this one... if you know how to create a 3-hour + plus taht starts and end at the middle of the entire story but doing it with poise which this film did... then you are a good director... kudos to Peter Jackson...
"Sep 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Excellent 2nd installment of the series.Not as good as the 1st and 3rd, but fantastic all the same! Amazing special effects. Def a must see, but obviously watch The Fellowship of the Ring First."
"Sep 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,Of course you have to see this. The best battles of the trilogy and Treebeard!
"Sep 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,watch this movie over and over.lol
"Sep 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,The middle chapter of any 3 part story is usually the hardest to execute. You have no beginning and no end. It's done as well as you could imagine in this film.
"Sep 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,"My favorite Rings movie. Lots of action, great story line.Just epic!"
"Sep 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,The second episode of which is arguably the best film trilogy ever made. Epica continues reigning over Middle Earth as the heroes go further on the journey. The climax now approaches and we can just be thrilled and fascinated while we wait for a conclusion.
"Sep 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,"just when i thought it was impossible to even play in the same standard as the prequel, this movie became the best thing in my 2002!!"
"Sep 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Surprisingly this sequel is better than the first, due to excellent new characters and superb battles and action. Along with an enjoyable story and a good script."
"Sep 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,"As was hinted in the previous film, Jackson has taken his own direction with Tolkien's fantasy. He has made the fate of the character Aragorn the primary focus of the movie rather than Frodo's quest. And there is certainly no whimsy in this film as was still faintly present in the last. The Two Towers has lost some of the darker depth of the last film (on the other hand, a bit more psychological depth has been introduced via the character Gollum), but has further embraced its epic feel. Also, The Two Towers contained quite possibly the greatest mass battle scene ever filmed."
"Sep 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,The Lord Rules!!!  Still trying to have a Lord of the Rings Day!! Sit down watch them all in one day
"Sep 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,"it is a lesser sequel, of course, as most part 2's are out of trilogies, but this movie still does not disappoint. with some fantastic special effects and storylines, this is a miraculous acheivement."
"Sep 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,one of the best movies I have ever seen . on the weekends sometimes my husband and I will watch the whole trilogy straight through.
"Sep 11, 2012",NEUTRAL,Great fun to watch with great story and atmospher
"Sep 11, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Segunda parte de la trilogia de ""Lord Of The Rings"" ofrecida por Peter Jackson que es un absoluto clasico en el cine de fantasia.  Smiegol no tiene nada que envidiarle a Klaus Kinski."
"Sep 10, 2012",NEUTRAL,"It was good but once again, as is common, did not beat the first."
"Sep 10, 2012",NEUTRAL,Admirable direction and performances with the great use of CGI make it one of my favourites.
"Sep 9, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Undoubtedly the best of the three, beautiful, touching, tragic and visually spectacular. The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers, is a masterpiece of the genre and cinema in general."
"Sep 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,anything that can make orlando bloom look good in a blonde wig is alright with me
"Sep 7, 2012",NEUTRAL,even the trees walked in that movie!!!
"Sep 7, 2012",NEUTRAL,"I want to give it five stars. But I am going to reserve it for Return of The King. Amazing movie. First half starts slow, but the battle of Rohan is amazing. And the March of Treants isn't too shabby."
"Sep 7, 2012",NEUTRAL,"After the slightly disappointing ending to <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i> -- it felt less like an ending and more like an arbitrary decision to cut the film off -- <i>The Two Towers</i> continues <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> story, and brings along with it the same sort of problem. It's the middle film in a three-part series, and as a result, it has no real beginning or ending part, nor does it conclude the vast majority of the arcs that it begins to establish. It leaves you feeling disappointed, not because it's bad, but because it feels like it's leading up to something that you'll don't get to see. Not yet, at least.

There are three distinct plots this time around. The most important is the one involving Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin), the Hobbits tasked with carrying the One Ring to Mordor in order to destroy is. They manage to convince Gollum (motion captured and voice work done by Andy Serkis), the creature who was consumed by the Ring for 500 years and who yearns for it every day, to act as their guide to lead them into the depths, and spend the entirety of the film walking by mountains and through bogs.

The second story involves two other Hobbits, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), who begin the film under Orc control but manage to escape early on. They head into a forest and spend pretty much the rest of the film hanging out with the Ents, a group of walking, talking trees. The Hobbits were initially being traced by the three other members of the Fellowship, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), but they end up going on a far different path.

They wind up heading to Rohan, a region ruled by Men, in order to aid them in their fight against the Orc armies. They meet up with Théoden (Bernard Hill), Rohan's king, and eventually team up with him which will eventually lead to a climactic, seemingly hour-long battle involving Men, Elves, and Orcs, which concludes our film. That battle is most certainly the film's highlight, as before that, mots of it consists of dialogue and people riding on horseback from one gorgeous location to another.

It's all set-up with only minimal payout. Most of the character and story arcs don't conclude in this film, leaving us wanting more. This is a problem with the book as well, but it's unfortunate that it happens here. We bide our time for far too long, as the Ring has to progress a certain distance before we can actually do anything of importance. Most of what happens here is leading up to the next film, or to the Battle of Helm's Deep, that hour-long war scene I mentioned earlier.

Speaking of our climactic battle, it's very exciting and is definitely worth the long time it takes to get to it. If you wanted to see a huge battle involving thousands of orcs and hundreds of humans, this is the one you need to watch. The death toll is large, the action is fresh and exciting, and there's enough humor injected into it to make it not as depraved as seeing hundreds of people die could be. Each of the characters involved gets a chance to shine, and it's the most exciting thing to happen in the series thus far.

A few new characters are introduced this time around, the first of which I've already mentioned. Théoden is here for about half the film, beginning our story under Saruman's (Christopher Lee) control. Éomer (Karl Urban), Théoden's nephew, and Éowyn (Miranda Otto), his niece, play fairly large roles as well. There's also Faramir (David Wenham), who shows up in the latter portion in Frodo's storyline. Only Faramir's story reaches a point where I was happy with it.

What we learn in <i>The Two Towers</i> is that the film is no longer about a Hobbit's quest to take the Ring to Mordor. Instead, it's about turning Aragorn into an action star. I know that it's more about him finally accepting his destiny as Isildur's heir and more or less becoming who he should have been in the first place, but this film barely touches on that. He becomes the star, gets the most exciting set-pieces, and is basically there just to kick all kinds of tail. The Hobbits are all more secondary characters, and their stories lack the energy of Aragorn's, this time around, at least.

The film still looks great, and despite all the meandering, is constantly entertaining. The world's fate is at stake, and while each action might not directly impact it, you watch to see what will eventually matter. These are all rich characters that are well-acted, so if you get to see a lot of them, there isn't much of a problem. I would have preferred a bit more action, but considering that's not what the book was like, I'm not going to complain much.

<i>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</i> is still a very enjoyable film, although it's not as good as its predecessor in large part because it feels like it doesn't go anywhere. It begins in the middle and ends in the middle, with a lot of talk that leads to nothing. The Helm's Deep battle is magnificent, and I'll watch these characters for hours on end, but I would have liked for a bit more to happen. It does make you want to see the third film right away, though."
"Sep 5, 2012",NEUTRAL,This was my favorite movie of the three. It was upbeat and past paced but also gave great depth to all the characters that allowed the third movie to have such a power impact on the viewers.
"Sep 5, 2012",NEUTRAL,I like Gollum...I guess I feel bad for him;)
"Sep 5, 2012",NEUTRAL,The road goes ever on and on...

"Sep 4, 2012",NEUTRAL,it worth a bag fresh shining field of tomatoes
"Sep 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,"My personal favourite of the three films. I love the Ents and Rohan. My recommendation however, is to be sure to watch the film in the extended version. I think it makes a difference on how good it is based on what they had cut out. With the extended, it adds a lot. Especially scenes with the Ents."
"Sep 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,always played at dinner time when the kids were over for the weekends. Big battle scenes
"Sep 2, 2012",NEUTRAL,The best movie ever!!
"Sep 2, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers carries over much of what made the first film fantastic--a sense of grand, epic scale. However, the plot can be muddling to the uninitiated and is far less accessible to those unacquainted with the source material than its predecessor."
"Sep 1, 2012",NEUTRAL,Really awesome but the ending was weak
"Aug 31, 2012",NEUTRAL,The lord of the rings is my favorite movie it shows how different racists can all come as one and how no matter how small you are you can change the chores of the future. This is prob my favorite out of the 3 mostly because shadowfex oh my if had a horse like that I'd be soo happy
"Aug 31, 2012",NEUTRAL,One of THE BEST sequels ever made. You don't see many good sequels in the movie business.
"Aug 31, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Tom watches this movie way too much, I'm sick of it!"
"Aug 31, 2012",NEUTRAL,Fantastic fantastical fantasy.
"Aug 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,Greatest English folkloric tale with one of the greatest directors alive. Nuph said.
"Aug 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,The action was a lot better than the first; the plot didn't fulfil the purpose of destroying the ring - perhaps I need to watch number 3.
"Aug 29, 2012",NEUTRAL,Part two of the best trilogy ever.
"Aug 29, 2012",NEUTRAL,The best scenes of the trilogy with the best action as well as character development and story. Purely put together and perfected.
"Aug 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers, then, is the greatest blockbuster ever made without either a beginning or an end, a feisty beast with a hollow ring in its bones."
"Aug 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The better of the three extended editions featuring a fantastic origin scene including Boromir's pre-One Ring phase that explores many characters at once: Boromir (from FOTR), Faramir (from TT), and Denethor (featured in ROTK). There are very few moments in the film where you would question its intentions."
"Aug 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Peter Jackson is a genius in all of the movies of this trilogy and I'm expecting big things from ""The Hobbit."" This chapter of the trilogy is my favorite because it balanced story telling with orc killing and did both very, very well."
"Aug 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,"I used to think this one was the best of the trilogy but after watching all three together I find this movie quite different. It's still a great movie and I watched the 4 hour directors cut but it doesn't hold together as well as 'Fellowship' after several watches... and I am nitpicking here but I feel Sauron & Saruman aren't really taken advantage of and we lose the mind of the evil force that is coming up against the people of Rohan. Instead we are just left with the masses of the enemy but no real emotional tie to the conflict, just cool action scenes and amazing cinematography and of course I can't forget the costumes & make up, seriously amazing work on these movies. The Lord of the Rings is what epic is all about."
"Aug 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,Fantastic...Thrilling. Great Movie.
"Aug 27, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Another Masterpiece. Great acting, good action sequences makes this a contender for best picture."
"Aug 27, 2012",NEUTRAL,The amazing adventure continues and is enjoyable every minute!
"Aug 26, 2012",NEUTRAL,The Journey Continues in part 2 of Jackson's masterpiece
"Aug 26, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Quite different from the book in a number of scenes, but Jackson has turned it into a wonderful movie."
"Aug 26, 2012",NEUTRAL,Probably the worst of the 3 but still amazing!!!
"Aug 26, 2012",NEUTRAL,Best one out of the trilogy. Stunning in all of its aspects.
"Aug 26, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Usually, the first movie is the best, the second one is ok, and the third or sucks, nut I loved every single one. I dont know if the second of third one is my favorite."
"Aug 26, 2012",NEUTRAL,"It has a great story, but it's very complicated and any viewers that didn't read the book will get confused by the amount of characters and locations they need to remember for it to all make sense. The effects, and acting is great, but there isn't much emotion and real attachment to any of the characters. This one does have much better direction during the action but Jackson still feels the need to get incredibly close to people's faces when the action has stopped. Also, none of the characters are particularly likable (and make very frustratingly dumb decisions), but it has some much needed action scenes. Also, there are a few plot holes & many of the simplest questions aren't answered."
"Aug 26, 2012",NEUTRAL,All of these are good.
"Aug 25, 2012",NEUTRAL,Worse than the first film. Pretty boring. But the ending was great.
"Aug 25, 2012",NEUTRAL,Perfect middle chapter.
"Aug 25, 2012",NEUTRAL,Awesome movie... love it so much
"Aug 25, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Better than the first film, in the sense of violence and pace of the entire story."
"Aug 24, 2012",NEUTRAL,Very solid film and defiantly better then the first one.
"Aug 24, 2012",NEUTRAL,The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers is my favorite movie out of the trilogy.
"Aug 24, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Pretty much everything the first movie has to offer and more, including Andy Serkis doing an excellent job as Gollum!  Jackson really nailed the details in this movie!"
"Aug 23, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, loved it just as much as the previous."
"Aug 23, 2012",NEUTRAL,AWESOME!!! The Battle Of Helms Deep is epic
"Aug 23, 2012",NEUTRAL,"It was going to be tough to create a sequel that was on par with the Fellowship, but Peter Jackson stepped up to the plate and hit a home run. He created a sequel that many can agree is the best of the trilogy. The Two Towers certainly has its moments and its adaptive story certainly lives up to expectations."
"Aug 23, 2012",NEUTRAL,My personal favorite of the series.
"Aug 22, 2012",NEUTRAL,Long but worth the time.
"Aug 22, 2012",NEUTRAL,Great special effects. And a great battle sequence.
"Aug 22, 2012",NEUTRAL,Excellent movie....recommend watching the extended one
"Aug 21, 2012",NEUTRAL,"my favourite of the three.  plus, how awesome did they make legolas?  what i love about this film is that so many things go on in the background, you almost forget to watch the people in focus."
"Aug 21, 2012",NEUTRAL,More Great story and more great action!
"Aug 21, 2012",NEUTRAL,"After a strong, if somewhat wobbly first film, The Lord Of The Rings trilogy goes significantly downhill with it's inferior sequel.  The Two Towers has all the strengths and flaws of the first, though the strengths have diminished slightly, and the flaws have an even bigger presence.

The Two Towers is a continuation of the original film, in which a young hobbit named Frodo Baggins, as well as some friends, attempt to destroy a mystical ring, though dark forces oppose them.

At the end of the first film, the main characters are split up, which unfortunately, makes the film extremely complicated.  Various plot lines are juggled and if the audience doesn't keep track of them all, things can get extremely confusing.

One plot line, involving Frodo and Sam attempting to destroy the ring on their own meet the Gollum.  The Gollum is truly the most interesting character in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  His conflicted nature splits him into two personalities, one who wants the ring, and will kill to get it, the other that truly cares about Frodo and Sam.  

The most uninteresting plot line involves Pippin and Merry being taken by walking trees and forced to do....nothing.  We scarcely ever see the duo, and when we do, it's often dull.  The primary source of comic relief in the first film is gone, making The Two Towers especially hard to watch.

There's less action and more talking.  The length has actually been increased by a quarter hour, which makes the film even more tedious than the original.  Even the dramatic battle at the end of epic scale is little compensation, as it doesn't feel very exciting.

At times, it feels like The Two Towers is repeating itself over and over again.  You can count on the fact that every hour or so, someone almost dies, only to be saved an arrow to the offender's head.  It's the primary source of escape in this film.

The acting, at the minimum, has not been hurt.  Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen and the rest of the cast are as strong as ever.  Christopher Lee's role, however, is significantly smaller, which is unfortunate.

Special effects also have not been affected in a negative way, and they are just as grand and marvelous as ever.

The score, by Howard Shore, feels a bit weaker than that of the original.  The main theme is used less frequently, and the usage of lighter pieces are almost completely gone, due to the film's darker nature.  It's still a good score, but it's weaker than it's predecessor's.

Dull to the point of hair pulling, The Two Towers fails to entertain.  Even with the addition of Gollum, The Two Towers is boring beyond belief, and the action scenes are minimal.  With little to excite viewers, it's a marvel that this tedious sequel actually has a positive reputation."

"Aug 21, 2012",NEUTRAL,"A stunning achievement powered by spectacular imagery and massive scale, and only slightly short of its predecessor in terms of storytelling and emotional depth."
"Aug 21, 2012",NEUTRAL,"was a good middle movie, just the only thing i didnt like was that it was just a middle movie so wasnt really a purpose but to get to the end"
"Aug 21, 2012",NEUTRAL,I have seen all LOR movies...aI absolutely love them all!
"Aug 21, 2012",NEUTRAL,"it seems slow, however, it still amazes me. Great story-telling."
"Aug 20, 2012",NEUTRAL,It's better than the first one for sure. The action is much better. Still a lot of battles but it seems to amble around less. I don't really care for them that much but I admire this one.
"Aug 20, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Just as good as the first

B+"
"Aug 20, 2012",NEUTRAL,this was an awesome trilogy
"Aug 20, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The second chapter of the epic tale of Lord of the Rings is just as incredible as the first. In this, we see the story and the characters go into much darker places. I didn't even think that was possible after all that happened in Fellowship, but I was sorely wrong. The fellowship is broken, there are characters scattered all over Middle-earth, and everything just seems hopeless. I loved the way that Peter Jackson conveyed the feeling of despair in each character at some point or another in the film. Grade: A"
"Aug 20, 2012",NEUTRAL,i have the collections..very good movie
"Aug 18, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The role of the a second film in a trilogy is often overlooked, but is probably the most important. The first film must introduce the adventure to audiences, and the third must conclude it. The role of the second film, therefore, is to simaltaneously build on the first film and prepare viewers for the third. But if this was all a second film did, it would be a dreadful bore, and that's exactly where The Two Towers is so successful. It's mesmerizing, and if the third film didn't exist, I would call the battle at the end of this film the greatest in cinema history. The Two Towers is brilliant and perfect in every way, tying the first and third together with grace, power and epic thrills."
"Aug 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,"It was unexpected, but Jackson has managed a better sequal, perfectly capturing everything that makes a great movie."
"Aug 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The next Chapter in the LOTR Trilogy Doesn't disappoint, especially with it's epic intense story-telling and directing"
"Aug 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,cant get into these..
"Aug 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Yes, the best movie ever made"
"Aug 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,"In my opinion, the best movie of the trilogy! Too much to explain-no words to describe, maybe- Phenomenal or great or A+?:D"
"Aug 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,Sucks you in and won't let you go till the end. Great epic battle scenes and a great story.
"Aug 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,Full blown fantasy..
"Aug 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Such a great movie. The trilogy is such an epic trilogy that really should be watched back to back. It's just filled with so many emotional scenes, deep character development, and so much attention to detail.  The extended edition adds a lot of depth to Faramir, showing flashbacks that emphasize his father's favoratism towards Boramir. It really provides reason for Faramir's actions, and we understand what he wants, but think of him as so much more of a hero when he doesn't take the ring, and ultimately let's Frodo, Sam and Gollum go. He really is my favorite character. Although, overall, this is not my favorite of the three, the first one is, but I can agree it is a great movie and a solid 10 out of 10. There is no reason at all for it to get any less, is there?"
"Aug 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,lord of the rings trilogy beats all other movies the amount of work and graphics used are incredible acting is okay storyline beyond awesome
"Aug 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,"i have found only one flaw with this film, when the characters stab at each other u can blatantly see that it was under the armpit, this happens in all 3 but apart from that very minor flaw it is a fantastic movie and did JRR Tolkien's best seller proud"
"Aug 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,"A fantastic second chapter in this epic trilogy. Just like the first film, it succeeds at giving you emotional depth, delivering memorable battle sequences, and it gets you more than excited to watch the final chapter. What I said about The Fellowship of the Ring applies here on The Two Towers."
"Aug 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,love this series jut puttin that out there
"Aug 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,"As visually stunning as the first installment, and a great continuation of the trilogy."
"Aug 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen, if judging a movie on standalone merit.  Those who liked the movie tended to have read the books, taking pressure off the director to actually capture what was needed into the movie.  This director completely failed to introduce character personalities, leaving a viewer who has not read the books disengaged from the characters - and wishing they could get their money back for three full hours that they won't get back.  No excuse for cut corners like that, especially for a three hour movie."
"Aug 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,Another good addition to the trilogy
"Aug 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,"yeah, a classic now, but long winded"
"Aug 11, 2012",NEUTRAL,My personal favorite of the trilogy.
"Aug 11, 2012",NEUTRAL,"I did as advised by my friends... watched the marathon run of the series... all the 3 parts in one go least i forget who is wat...there is like a plethora of characters...
nothing much to say about the series... but i reiterate this series is worth watching once... can't do that again..."
"Aug 11, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The trilogy continues with the felling of bigger action, based on an epic battle, all taken at the next level"
"Aug 11, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers has a lot more action than the first, and Jackson and company do a superb job of weaving the three different character storylines together. As a film it does what any great ""middle"" movie should do, as it alone could stand as a great movie, but it also connects the Fellowship and the Return seamlessly."
"Aug 9, 2012",NEUTRAL,"really really long, but i like the ghost guys."
"Aug 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The perfect TLoR movie, or any magical movie of all time."
"Aug 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,The second in the trilogy and possibly the best. Great battle scenes at the end and really sets you up for the final chapter.
"Aug 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,Helms Deep is still my favorite battle scene ever!!!
"Aug 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,"A little boring, but, at the same time, very good."
"Aug 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Masterfully done, especially the action scenes and the score. The cast develops the story with precision."
"Aug 5, 2012",NEUTRAL,"pour ma part, je trouve que ces le meilleur des : The Lord of the rings"
"Aug 5, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The weakest entry in The Lord of the Rings trilogy is still epic in every sense of the word.  While the first film focused more on the majestic fantasy of Middle Earth, Two Towers shifts that focus toward long, drawn-out battle scenes.  These are no ordinary battle scenes, either.  In fact, I have never seen another film (or film series) that captures warfare on such a large-scale.  The result is thrilling, and the endless waves of combat never really wears out its welcome.  While the breaking of the fellowship at the end of the first picture was necessary, it makes the plot somewhat disorienting as the story constantly shifts between the separated parties.  I have also never been a big fan of Gollum, and his role in this film is a bit ambiguous.  The true importance of the character isn't truly fleshed out until the final film.  Nonetheless, Two Towers is everything one would hope for and serves as an excellent continuation of the trilogy."
"Aug 5, 2012",NEUTRAL,Few can dispute the sheer magical epicness of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The Two Towers is a much darker and grim film in comparison to the others though. Evil is fully explored here. Peter Jackson's genius is fully realised in this trilogy which has to be one of the best of all time.
"Aug 5, 2012",NEUTRAL,Best trilogy of all time only batman could challenge it
"Jul 26, 2012",NEUTRAL,The sheer brilliance of Two Towers can be summarized in 5 words : The Battle at Helm's Deep.
"Jul 26, 2012",NEUTRAL,The continuation of a true epic.
"Jul 26, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The film draws you in, and never lets you down as it delivers more action and more complexity than the first one. It is a brilliant lead into the finale. The fantastic thing about the film is that though it is of the fantasy genre, we feel close to these characters and actually care about their situation. It's surprising that despite the use of CGI work, nothing seems fake. Everything is tangible and raw."
"Jul 25, 2012",NEUTRAL,it just kept gettin better
"Jul 25, 2012",NEUTRAL,I love the tale and the movie.
"Jul 25, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers is not only part of the greatest fantasy epic, but it also manages to improve on the first movie- the stakes are higher and things have just gotten more epic. The acting, music, and cinematography is superb, even by today's ever improving standards."
"Jul 25, 2012",NEUTRAL,I watch the movies times and times again. It really never gets boring even though I know every little details of it. This episode is probably the best in the trilogy. Peter Jackson is the man of epic movies.
"Jul 25, 2012",NEUTRAL,"A dense and amazing adventure through a whimsically imagined universe that will not only get your blood pumping and your adrenaline flowing, but will also appeal to the more emotional side of you as well. You can't help but just gasp in awe as good vs. evil fights for middle earth. If there was a word to describe this, or any of the other LOTs, it would be breathtaking."
"Jul 24, 2012",NEUTRAL,"LOTR, one of my favorite series!"
"Jul 24, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Another smashing hit coming from Peter Jackson, not at all worse than its predecessor. Still a thing of beauty, with a plot that gives this adventure-driven film a huge kick."
"Jul 24, 2012",NEUTRAL,I dream of having a battle all night for a fortress against invading hordes.
"Jul 23, 2012",NEUTRAL,The Lord of the Rings is the Lord of the Films.
"Jul 23, 2012",NEUTRAL,The second movie in the Rings trilogy.  A absolute epic.
"Jul 23, 2012",NEUTRAL,A Sequel that extends the grand scale of the first without diluting its spirit.
"Jul 23, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Continuing Frodo's quest, this is one of the few sequels that can rival it's predecessor."
"Jul 23, 2012",NEUTRAL,and yet still not as good as the book!
"Jul 22, 2012",NEUTRAL,"My favorite of this trilogy, it has from the first and amplifies it. It's more action and less adventure, but it makes up for it with more perfect casting and Gollum. It also has one of the best action scenes ever put to film, battle of Helms Deep, and just perfect story-telling."
"Jul 21, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Better than it's predecessor, but obviously not as good it's successor, ""The Two Towers"" had a good mix of every that the trilogy encompasses."
"Jul 21, 2012",NEUTRAL,"My personal favorite of Lord of the Rings movies. The Two Towers, as expected, delivers both visually and emotionally. However, what sets it apart is the pure entertainment value that exceeds its predecessor and successor."
"Jul 21, 2012",NEUTRAL,really good trilogy this isn't as good as the others but still top notch. Christopher Lee is immense.
"Jul 20, 2012",NEUTRAL,if  you've not seen this film your a muppet!!
"Jul 20, 2012",NEUTRAL,The Two Towers perfectly expands the emotional depth and scale of the series.
"Jul 20, 2012",NEUTRAL,There's a reason people love this mythology. The wonderful story continues.
"Jul 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,part of the best trilogy ever
"Jul 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Equally as good as the first installment and equally as underachieving. It has two major action sequences, and being a three hour movie, that means there is loads of dialogue and exposition. I have no problem with long periods of talking (12 Angry Men might just be my favorite movie of all time), but the dialogue isn't anything super special and nothing much really happens in between the two battle sequences. How can nothing really happen in a movie this long? Well, the running time is divided between 4 different story lines so none of the story arcs really have time to advance very far. The battle sequences are enjoyable as well as all the production values throughout the film, and it does manage to set up the final movie very well."
"Jul 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Yep, this was excellent too.  The question asked back then was when it came to this film was: how can the next and final one be better than this?"
"Jul 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,It is just perfect; there's no use explaining why. It just is.
"Jul 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,There's a lot of action and it's pretty easy to keep watching. Despite the fact that it's 3 hours long
"Jul 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,Best movie ever! Classic for epic fantasy lovers!
"Jul 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,cant remmeber if i seen this one or not lol
"Jul 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,Its LoTR... It was extremely well done!
"Jul 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,The more this trilogy progresses the better these movies are! The Battle of Helms Deep is brillant!
"Jul 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The perfect trilogy continues with this second part of Peter Jackson's amazing storyline. The two towers is has the most drawn out talking but is made up by the spectacular battles that are taken place. The two towers draws the fellowship of the ring to the return of the king in a way that is something not many other trilogys could do. Again if you haven't seen this movie, go see it! A must see."
"Jul 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,personally its my favorite lord of the rings movie.
"Jul 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,Favorite movies ever!
"Jul 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,Not as good as the others but a necessary step in the trilogy. The battle at Helms Deep is awesome! Again the extended is better!
"Jul 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers is said to be the best out of the trilogy. Personally, I disagree. But its still Excellent in every way."
"Jul 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Even better than the first, picks up and multiplies all the drama from the first."
"Jul 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers succeeds where The Fellowship of the Ring failed. It is longer, but this is less evident than in the first. There are epic battle scenes, beautiful set pieces, humor, and -well, let's just say that The Battle of Helm's Deep was probably one of the best action scenes I've ever seen. Just beautifully done and amazing. You should watch it, especially the extended editions. The extended editions are longer but possess way more action, a few deleted scenes, and documentaries."
"Jul 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy slows down a bit in the middle, just like the books. The Two Towers is more than necessary. It's vital & I enjoy it."
"Jun 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,Very few miss steps.
"Jun 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,One of the best movies ever!
"Jun 18, 2012",NEUTRAL,"amazing action, amazing story. possibly the best of the series."
"Jun 18, 2012",NEUTRAL,just not a huge fan of the movies
"Jun 18, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The best of the trilogy for me, absolutely perfect!"
"Jun 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,Better than the first
"Jun 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,It seemed way too dark the whole time.
"Jun 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,pretty fun except for the Homosexual actor in the leading role
"Jun 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,peter jackson is my home boy!
"Jun 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,nice full moon from the beginning could have been better could have been worse.
"Jun 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,Awesome movie. Loved it.
"Jun 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,Continues the story quite well. Lots of new characters and surprises.
"Jun 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,The battle for helms deep was awesome!
"Jun 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,"More political than the first, but still just as good. The war scene was done very well."
"Jun 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,"I remember seeing this in the theatre and when it ended I was both amazed and frustrated. Amazed at seeing such a great movie, and frustration from having to wait a year to watch the conclusion. I am glad I can now watch the third one straight away."
"Jun 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,Character development is one that is perfected during the trilogy.
"Jun 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,Favorite movies ever!
"Jun 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,One of the most epic action movies ever.
"Jun 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,Awesome finale of the film adaptions.
"Jun 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Usually a trilogy suffers from an unnecessary sequel. Trust me, folks, this one is very, very necessary."
"Jun 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,havent seen it in forver
"Jun 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Toooooooooooooooo loooooooooooong , sorry not a big fan of these films."
"Jun 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,Wonderful and effective storytelling.
"Jun 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,"It's less repetitive than the first instalment loosening the movie a little bit, but remains to feel constricted and stuffed for the designated 3 hours, causing some pacing issues. None the less, its enchanting score, memorable performances, utter complexity & spectacular visuals make this engaging and transfix eyes to the screen, keeping full interest and deep, intelligent thoughts during the movie."
"Jun 2, 2012",NEUTRAL,epic film. It's a masterpiece in the genre of fantasy!
"Jun 2, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The battles are bigger, the visuals more impressive, the saga continues with little to complain about."
"Jun 2, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic, there is just a character in there who's scenes could be taken out and the film could be no different, aka I didn't like that character."
"Jun 1, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The second chapter of Peter Jackson's epic trilogy is *bigger and badder* than it's predecessor. Fueled and charged with engaged drama, anticipating build-up, and larger-than-life epic battle scenes: this is quite the achievement in filmmaking."
"Jun 1, 2012",NEUTRAL,"trop bon!!
(So good!!)"
"Jun 1, 2012",NEUTRAL,great!!! grand!! good!!
"Jun 1, 2012",NEUTRAL,One of the best Battles ever portrait in a movie.
"May 31, 2012",NEUTRAL,I liked all the action in this one
"May 31, 2012",NEUTRAL,You should watch this immediately after watching The Fellowship.  If you do this I recommend watching these on a Saturday or Sunday.  It's worth it.
"May 31, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The second film in the LOTR trilogy splits up the Fellowship, this film is where the story really picks up."
"May 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,i love lord of the rings. my fav movies my fav books. no questions asked.
"May 29, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Although Hollywood in general is not known for making good sequels, this breaks that curse and continues a great movie trilogy."
"May 29, 2012",NEUTRAL,One of the best movies ever created.
"May 29, 2012",NEUTRAL,Loved it. The battle scenes are unbelievably realistic
"May 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,awesome movie keep in your seat at every moment. the direction of the movie is the best thing of the whole movie.
"May 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,i liked it but still feel like its slightly overrated
"May 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic sequel, a true blockbuster."
"May 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is one of the greatest fantasy epics ever made.  Peter Jackson has done an amazing job adapting J.R.R. Tolkien's novel, making it a seamless continuation in this beloved trilogy.  The special effects are astonishing, delivering some of the most remarkable battle sequences ever made.  Additionally, the cast has improved their performances and have really emerged themselves in their characters.  Everything in this film, the cinematography, the score, the costumes, the sets, is spectacularly done.  The Two Towers delivers a compelling story and an outstanding adventure."
"May 27, 2012",NEUTRAL,Can't stand these movies...
"May 27, 2012",NEUTRAL,seriously the greatest film series based on the greatest book series.
"May 25, 2012",NEUTRAL,close from perfection!!
"May 25, 2012",NEUTRAL,This was  the perfect 2nd movie. I dont think neone could have done a better job.
"May 24, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Love this movie but it was missing a lot from the book, still it was amazing"
"May 24, 2012",NEUTRAL,"My least favorite LOTR film but still one of the best films ever made, Peter Jackson: True Visionary"
"May 21, 2012",NEUTRAL,"It's such a great follow up to the first one. This is the ""action movie"" of the trilogy. Helm's Deep is by far one of the greatest (if not the greatest) battle sequences ever captured on celluloid"
"May 20, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Simply spectacular and beautiful! Love the music, cinematography, acting, everything! Just wish the story could move a little more faster in some scenes. 
Gandalf rules!"
"May 20, 2012",NEUTRAL,"weaponry, cool looking, cool music"
"May 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,people who don't finish the trilogy just don't have the attention span II
"May 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,The battle scene at the end is worth watching.
"May 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,time to spit up and make a move
"May 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Seriously, my eye lids are soooo heavy. Maybe I'll just shut then for a sec....."
"May 18, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Just as engaging, beautiful, and dramatic as its predecessor, The Two Towers continues the adventure in fantastic fashion. While it might not be as exciting as the beginning or the ending of the trilogy, its introduction of Gollum and the separate stories more than make up for it. Battles are as epic as ever, aided by stunning visual effects and beautiful settings. The cast, likewise, continues to deliver strong performances across the board. The Two Towers is yet another exciting entry in Peter Jackson's near-perfect trilogy."
"May 18, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Amazing effects, great characters, landscapes, and incredible action. Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers isn't just the best movie of 2002... its might be the best movie of all time."
"May 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,"I remember falling asleep at midnight durring this movie back in 5th grade.

But the Extended cut brought so much more to enjoy and keep myself awake for. This is my least favorite of the three, but the added character development with Boromir and Faramir was absolutely perfect and deserved a spot in the theatrical run.

Also, they could have done a better job with some of the cuts and minor editing aspects that really make it looks dated already or even sloppy."
"May 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The precious saga progresses with a substantial dose of memorable battle scenes demonstrating the films audio and video supremacy, unmatched layers of complexity within both antagonist and protagonist, execution and production unlike anything we've ever seen before."
"May 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Saga continuous. Along with fantastic cinematography,graphics and soundtrack"
"May 7, 2012",NEUTRAL,boring! had a nice nap.
"May 7, 2012",NEUTRAL,"ONE of the best movies of all time, if you havent seen it, well you better get a move on!"
"May 7, 2012",NEUTRAL,"To follow up a masterpiece is a daunting task for any filmmaker.The task faced by Peter Jakson in making The Two Towers was fomidable,but the eventual product turned out to be  moreso.Well acted,woderfully shot and skillfully told storyline,The Lord Of The Rings continues strongly thanks to the Two Towers."
"May 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The first chapter was basically character introductions; in 'The Two Towers', we see the real adventure start to play out.  There are some exciting moments in this one, but the whole film is basically building up to an hour-long climatic battle of epic proportions.  We are also introduced to the bizarre Gollum character, which that in itself is enough reason to watch."
"May 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,"While not the best LoR movie, it's certainly the most inventive."
"May 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,"It benefits from being the middle film and not needing to start or finish conclusively, but whatever the reason, it's an epic film that never loses its engagement and by far my favourite one in the trilogy."
"May 5, 2012",NEUTRAL,Loved every second of it.
"May 5, 2012",NEUTRAL,Was alright but needed for the other two.
"May 4, 2012",NEUTRAL,"All seemed lost at Helms Deep, until the arrival of the Rohirrimm. The best moment would have to be Aragorn riding with the Rohan King."
"May 4, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers presents a fresh, darker and more epic tone than Fellowship and uses the growing uncertainty of the Ring's fate to construct enough dramatic depth."
"May 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,all lotr are worth seeig many times
"May 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,Here's where the corruption ensued - The Two Oscars.
"May 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,"My favourite of the series, although they all deserve no less than 5 stars. The epic, the characters, the relationships, the complete encompassing of a whole new world... battles.. it's just fun fun fun."
"May 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,"After watch this piece of art I'm only want more. Full of good action, and intensity. Probably the best of the trilogy."
"May 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,Good movie well design ...
"May 2, 2012",NEUTRAL,The darkest of the three. And the most hopeful. Talk about a great film.
"May 2, 2012",NEUTRAL,Probably my favorite of the three
"May 2, 2012",NEUTRAL,The weakest of the three LOTR films. Still good.
"May 2, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The best of the trilogy. More action, less walking."
"May 1, 2012",NEUTRAL,Second if the trillogy this film focuses more on the war itself then the troubles of Frodo. Battles are amazing.
"May 1, 2012",NEUTRAL,I absoultely love all of the Lord of the rings movies!
"Apr 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,My favorite of the trilogy.  The special effects are incredible.
"Apr 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,It has Elijah Wood in it...nuff said.
"Apr 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The battle of Helm's Deep is a battle worth watching. Big, broken, courage and hope. Andy Serkis pull an amazing role as Gollum."
"Apr 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,great movie especially loved smeagol/gollum
"Apr 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The most underrated chapter in the trilogy, The Two Towers boasts one of the best battles in the history of cinema. Incredibly well-made and superbly plotted, everything builds up to that conflict. Yes, it is slow moving at times, but it rewards patience. Nothing short of a masterpiece."
"Apr 29, 2012",NEUTRAL,i love that movie it was great all the killing and stuff a saw it 20 times
"Apr 29, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Educating Alex with LOTR, he asks so many questions!"
"Apr 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Every elemental aspect of what makes a film beautiful compliments one another here perfectly. This time around Jackson has nailed the element of atmospheric lighting more so than in the first installment, crafting viscerally bleak sorrow that bleeds pure emotion with the driving structure of impacting performances, The Two Towers is a movie created from experience shown through commitment, that trumps its predecessor as it should, by deftly blending drama and soul with its vast scope of epic fantasy action. Bringing cinematic art to awesomely powerful levels in every area."
"Apr 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,Orlando bloom need i say more????
"Apr 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers is probably is my least favorite movie out of the series, but I still love this movie. Even though this movie has the fewest action out of the trilogy, whenever the action and battle sequences happen, it's nothing short from spectacular. Filled with fantastic acting, fantastic direction, and excellent storytelling, I absoultely love this film."
"Apr 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,A monumental technical achievement.
"Apr 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,Beyond improvement? My favorite of the 3
"Apr 27, 2012",NEUTRAL,BORING! don't understand why people go crazy for this.
"Apr 27, 2012",NEUTRAL,"pretty good
but confusing"
"Apr 27, 2012",NEUTRAL,This is one of the best movies of the best series ever made! It shouldn't be in the same category as all the others! This one gets 15 stars!
"Apr 27, 2012",NEUTRAL,The battle at Helms Dee[ - one of the best fight scenes I've ever seen in a movie.
"Apr 27, 2012",NEUTRAL,Words can't describe it.
"Apr 26, 2012",NEUTRAL,"La saga tomó su importancia cuando cierto flaquito se apareció entre nuestros heroes, sellando el destino que les deparará."
"Apr 25, 2012",NEUTRAL,Good not great. Worst of the series
"Apr 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,These movies are awesome. Especially the extended versions.
"Apr 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,"A part two of a trilogy that rivals ""The	Empire Strikes Back"". A great achievement."
"Apr 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The worst of the Lord of the Rings series, too many unnecessary differences from the books for my liking, but of course still fantastic."
"Apr 18, 2012",NEUTRAL,"AdaptaÃ§Ã£o fantÃ¡stica, mas deixa a desejar. Mesmo sendo um pouco decepcionante se comparado Ã s duas outras adaptaÃ§Ãµes ( Sociedade Do Anel e Retorno do Rei), ainda sim, este filme Ã (C) realmente incrÃ­vel. NÃ£o um fim nem um inÃ­cio, mas uma ponte segura ligando  entre a Sociedade e o Rei. Exatamente agradÃ¡vel, por assim dizer."
"Apr 18, 2012",NEUTRAL,I know every thing about this movie.
"Apr 18, 2012",NEUTRAL,An brilliantly acted fantasy adventure that does Tolkien's second chapter justice.
"Apr 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,"not quite as deep as the books, but in bringing the story to the masses, Jackson did a very good job of it."
"Apr 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,least favorite out of the this series
"Apr 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,Too dark and I got really sick of Frodo
"Apr 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,"awsome beginning,brings u rit in the thick of things"
"Apr 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,My favourite trilogy of all time!!
"Apr 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,AMASING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Apr 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Mind blowing, takes your breath away!"
"Apr 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,"An essential component of what is now destined to be among the best film franchises of all time. Spectacular in every sense of the word, even if you don' t know an Orc from a Uruk-Hai. Once again the cast are spot and every page (At least almost) comes alive with utter brilliance, the cast are really getting into their characters now which seemed hard on paper and to bring Middle Earth alive is a great feat. Peter Jackson has done a wonderful job and only nutcases can't see how much hard work and art has been put into this film, it does get a little slow in the middle but after that is an epic rush. It's just so beautiful to watch. The film draws you in, and never lets you down as it delivers more action and more complexity than the first one. It is a brilliant lead into the finale. The fantastic thing about the film is that though it is of the fantasy genre, we feel close to these characters and actually care about their situation. It's surprising that despite the use of CGI work, nothing seems fake. Everything is tangible and raw."
"Apr 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,A great pt two of the 3 trilogy as with the first part it is visually stunning with great effects and brillant casting !
"Apr 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,"One thing of the Two Towers I didn't like was there was three main stories it kept switching from. They were all good, but it would be nice if it showed one story all the way through, then the other, then the other. That is just me though. Other then that everything was good, the acting especially from Gandalf improved. The ending ""Gollum's plan"" was a great closing along with the song ""Gollum's Song"" I liked in the first one when they were all together instead of separate. The battle for Helm's deep was magnificent."
"Apr 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,An amazing story & an amazing film adventure (:
"Apr 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,exceptional film. acting is amazing and cinematography is beautiful.
"Apr 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,A great second act.  The battle of Helms Deep is intese and exciting.
"Apr 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,i know it was boring but it was a filler to all the action that happened in the first and the last read the book it is really good!!!! loved the movie and book!!
"Apr 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,Slow motion bastards..
"Apr 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,this is my favorite out of the trilogy. Gollum is my fav.
"Apr 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,My favorite book in the trilogy and I loved the adaptation here.
"Apr 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,all 3 of them were great movies
"Apr 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,The second of the very best.
"Apr 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Out of the three, it's the worst. That being said, TTT is a solid movie!"
"Apr 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,It's fantastic. Need I say more?
"Apr 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,great movie sometimes a little slow and very informational but just to great
"Apr 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,u all know how good it is
"Apr 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers is practically the middle of the The Lord of the Rings story; it doesn't have a beginning because that has been provided by The Fellowship of the Ring and it doesn't have an ending because that will be provided in the sequel. 

This is a little disappointing because it's another mightily long movie (179 minutes) that doesn't seem to materialise anywhere. But the fact that I am still giving the rating of four stars most certainly implies that the sequel was still an excellent film to say the least.

This time, unlike in the predecessor where everyone stuck together the squad splits in three. Frodo (Wood) and Sam (Astin) must continue in their quest to Mordor where they come across devious creature Gollum (voiced by Andy Serkis) who claims that he will help them in their quest to destroy 'The Ring'; is their new ally as innocent as he seems however?

The second group of the crew is made up of fellow hobbits Merry (Dom Monagham) and Pippin (Billy Boyd). The duo narrowly escape a brawl with Sauron's forces and are left alone in the woods with trees which are able to talk, walk and are basically comparable to 80ft humans! However, will the two hobbits find a helpful ally in them...or an unwanted villain?

The third and biggest of the bunches are the warriors. Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Aragon (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davis) and co. battle for Middle Earth against Sauron's forces, protecting Frodo and Sam for them as they do this. They plan to take down Saruman (Christopher Lee) who is a big piece of Sauron's army.

Bigger and better than the first one? I think not, but a mightily good effort from Jackson again, replicating J.R.R Tolkien's fine books. Again a little long but an equally good movie all the same."
"Apr 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,The action was a lot better than that of the first. Still I found the pace of this movie to be more or less stagnant until the long drawn out battle that had some really cool visuals.
"Apr 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,"my favorite in the series, not much to say, greatest movie trilogy of all time"
"Apr 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Again, I sooo love it!"
"Apr 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Again, I sooo love it!"
"Apr 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,I rank the extended version up there with Fellowship.
"Apr 11, 2012",NEUTRAL,Best of the series much like Empire Strikes Back before it.
"Apr 11, 2012",NEUTRAL,All three films=11 glorious hours and 23 spectacular minutes of movie.
"Apr 11, 2012",NEUTRAL,A masterpiece. Peter Jackson outdid himself.
"Apr 11, 2012",NEUTRAL,"A little bit better than the first, especially with Smeagle. But, still a tad too long."
"Apr 10, 2012",NEUTRAL,One Ring To Find Them....
"Mar 21, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The two towers continues the lord of the rings trilogy as one of the best sequels ever made, along with Empire strikes back."
"Mar 20, 2012",NEUTRAL,A perfect sequel.. Quite possibly the greatest movie I've ever seen.
"Mar 20, 2012",NEUTRAL,Good but sometimes it's boaring... the extended version makes it more fun
"Mar 20, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Excellent book, excellent movie."
"Mar 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,boooaring! Felt asleep seeing it.
"Mar 18, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The best Lord of the Rings film period. It had so many memorable moments and tons of brilliant action sequences. Believe it or not, I liked Orlando Bloom this time around. It is a lot more aware that it has to put important thing into the time limit instead of useless things. It progresses the story further, but sometimes, I feel lost. There is like 20 stories going on at a time."
"Mar 18, 2012",NEUTRAL,love love love it. Its one of the best trilogies ever made.
"Mar 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,The high point of the series and perfectly positioning the finale.
"Mar 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,Easily the best one out of the trilogy!
"Mar 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,i <3 the battle of helm's deep and the gollum scenes
"Mar 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Good to watch for the sake of the series, but does not bring anything other than effects to the table as far as emotional heartstring tugging."
"Mar 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,Got kind of tired of the rallying of armies...
"Mar 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Again, it's been a while, but I know it's good."
"Mar 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Lord of the Rings is my favourite trilogy ever, and I love it! It's just a beautiful epic."
"Mar 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,this was really good
"Mar 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,walking..... talking.... walking....talking
"Mar 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,Brilliant fantastic.
"Mar 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,"One of my favorite movies, will do review later."
"Mar 11, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Another amazing movie, without a doubt! Keeps getting better ;)"
"Mar 10, 2012",NEUTRAL,My least favorite of all three films.
"Mar 9, 2012",NEUTRAL,I liked this one almost more than the first. I do not see how Peter Jackson pulled off this magnificient movie triagy
"Mar 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,"With a much darker mood than it's predecessor, Two Towers does a wonderful job despite not benefitting from a beginning or a conclusion as the first and final films do. Notable performances include Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn."
"Mar 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,epic! best film of the trilogy
"Mar 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,You should take an afternoon off to watch this. Everything is set on such a massive scale and it's escapism like you've never seen before a must see for fans of sci fi and fantasy epics
"Mar 7, 2012",NEUTRAL,A bit on the boring side...
"Mar 7, 2012",NEUTRAL,se sintio muy larga..
"Mar 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,The best of the series. The most violent and has the best fight scene.
"Mar 5, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Although not as eye-opening as the first film (Fellowship of the Ring) and impressively concluded as its successor, a terrific film although slightly less engaging."
"Mar 4, 2012",NEUTRAL,Really better in the special extended edition...
"Mar 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,The Second movie in the lord of the Rings was also really a good Show to see.
"Mar 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,Best of the series.  The battle of helm's deep will be legendary for years to come
"Mar 1, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Personally this was not as good as The Return of the King, still an amazing movie with awesome cast. Great in so many levels."
"Feb 29, 2012",NEUTRAL,Deeper characters and more fascinating drama propel the franchise forward in a far more exciting and intriguing installment than the opener.
"Feb 29, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Easily the greatest film series of our time.

just sayin'"
"Feb 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,Best lord of the rings film.
"Feb 28, 2012",NEUTRAL,The one where all battles take place! Great sequel to the first! Definitely deserved to sweep the oscars!
"Feb 27, 2012",NEUTRAL,I really really really loved this movie great great sequel :)
"Feb 27, 2012",NEUTRAL,not as good as the first one and not as good as the third one. but it is still better then a lot of movies
"Feb 22, 2012",NEUTRAL,The second best movie ever!
"Feb 21, 2012",NEUTRAL,sin palabras!! the lord of the rings forever!
"Feb 21, 2012",NEUTRAL,Love this movie. It's really good if you like adventure movies.
"Feb 21, 2012",NEUTRAL,even better than the first!
"Feb 21, 2012",NEUTRAL,"My least favorite of the trilogy. I didn't care for how this movie pretty much switched the protagonist from Frodo to Aragorn. I didn't care for the romance between Aragorn and Arwen when I was a kid (because I was nine). But now as a film buff who loves great movie romance, I'm still not on board with the Aragorn and Arwen story. However, the action sequences are impressive."
"Feb 20, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Previously, on 24. I mean, The Lord of the Rings: The One Ring of Power has been found. After a perilous journey for the fellowship of the ring that ended with Gandalf (Ian McKellen) falling to what seemed to be his doom with the balrog at the bridge of Khazad-dum, the rest of the fellowship escaped. After respite in the land of Lothlorien, they journeyed on, and Boromir (Sean Bean) succumbed to the ring's power and fell against the Uruk Hai. We pick up where that left off: With a splintered fellowship heading in separate directions, which expand the scope. We have Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) heading to Mordor, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli (Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies) hunting the Uruk Hai of Isengard (One of the ""two towers"") who have Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) and think they have the ring. These are the three main groups the perspective alternates between. Frodo and Sam finally come face-to-face with Gollum (Andy Serkis in his breakout motion capture performance), and take him as a guide to Mordor (The other of the ""two towers"" in The Two Towers). Throughout, Frodo is the only one who treats him kindly, but no one else does, which will come into play in Return of the King. Andy Serkis does an amazing job, both with capturing the motion and the emotion of Gollum: From the gangly movements to the gurgly voice that has become iconic in the 13 years since this film released, and he performs Gollum's bipolar very well, especially in scenes where Smeagol and Gollum ""talk"" to each other. The diverse trio takes us to the kingdom of Rohan, where King Theoden (Bernard Hill) has been corrupted by Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), an ""advisor"" whose ""advice"" made Theoden kick out his own nephew Eomer (Karl Urban), who helps out the Uruk Hai trackers. Grima's ""advice"" eventually gets him in trouble with Gandalf (Spoiler alert: He survived, but not a spoiler because he was in the trailers, and the story's been around for 60+ years as of my writing this review) and Theoden. After learning of the terror Saruman wrought in lands far off from the city of Edoras, the people all go to a fortress called ""Helm's Deep"" and prepare for what is undoubtedly one of the most visually-stunning large-scale battles ever committed to film, and one that is more emotionally charged than anything Peter Jackson would put out ten+ years later. It is not in computer generated imagery that battles are committed to film, but in the emotional stakes and the gritty harshness of the battle: Hard rain, truly imposing Uruk Hai, and weapons of unimaginable (to them) destruction. It's good they didn't lead with this kind of battle. Finally, the story alternates to Merry and Pippin's encounter and subsequent travels with Treebeard the Ent (Voiced by Gimli's John Rhys-Davies), an ancient race of trees that can walk and talk like us, but are easy going, except when Saruman (Christopher Lee) fells trees the Ents know. They take it personally. This is a massive film, but when there is not a climactic battle raging, we get to know our main characters, from the Hobbits' sentimentality many of us could relate to, to Gimli and Legolas' growing to trust each other/get along as best elves and dwarves can, given their history. The battle is spectacular, and the CGI is incredible on Gollum and the Ents, but one thing they couldn't breath life into were the backgrounds of medium-shots of Merry and Pippin riding on Treebeard: It's too obvious Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd are in front of a green-screen for these sequences. When we see Treebeard and them on him, it's as if they're actually on a tree. Howard Shore provides a grander score for the grander scope, now that the story is starting to intensify: Gone are the flutes and easy tune of the Hobbit themes, except for a small dose here or there, but they can never go back to the way it was. Things have certainly grown gloomy since Frodo set out on his quest to destroy that ring, but there's still the occasional laugh you can find (I found one in Helm's Deep). Gimli and Legolas also provide great on-screen chemistry that creates almost as much comic relief as Merry and Pippin. This may be the part where the kids would ask you to turn off the movie because it's gotten too dark, but you will have to watch through the end to see if the sun shines brighter than ever after an especially dark night."
"Feb 20, 2012",NEUTRAL,A sequel that improves on the first. It does take a while to build up to the final battle at Helms Deep but its worth the wait.
"Feb 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The Little Hobbit's Journey continues with an amazing sequel, with an outstanding performance from Andy Serkis ""Gollum"", the soundtrack continues to be perfect along with the great script. The Battle For Middle Earth is close to an end, following the greatest fantasy adapted films."
"Feb 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,fantastic and even better than the 1st
"Feb 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,"How come, this movie didnt get nominated for best direction and make up? When I first saw this I was shocked by the realistic looking fantasy world. It sucks you in and doesn't lets you out!"
"Feb 18, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Incredible, just amazing. Make sure you see the extended version."
"Feb 18, 2012",NEUTRAL,"In the extended edition version of ""The Two Towers"", most of the changes come in the form of scenes that were already present in the theatrical version but have been extended here, however there are a few notable differences therein: such as additional footage of Frodo and Sam, the Ents, and Merry and Pipin as well.
Among the most notable additions is a short scene showing Theodred's (Theoden's son's) funeral.
This version also gives us a lot more information regarding Aragorn's status as Dunedain by finally revealing his age (over 80 years old) as well as a scene in which Saruman becomes aware that Aragorn is of Dunedain lineage.
My favorite new scene in this film is a flashback of Faramir in which his relationship with his brother, Boromir, and his father, Lord Denethor (who doesn't appear in the theatrical version) is expanded on, resulting in Faramir being developed further as a character.

"Feb 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,My favorite of the trilogy. The Battle @ Helm's Deep makes me cry every time.
"Feb 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Question 'Could Jackson make a sequel that is better than TFOTR?'. Answer:'erm...Yes!'. Defining the word 'big' in a bigger way once again, we follow the hobbits as they continue their journey to destroy the word ring. I had one question in my head when i went to see this film, 'can it possibly be better than the first film?' and it was. It was astounding. Completely mesmerising. Darker and more dngerous, it continues where the first film ended, and Frodo and Sam have a long journey ahead. Not only is this the best of the trilogy for me, its one of my favourite films. Attracting you so much you dont even notice the time flying by. Jackson yet again tells a story of hope, love, loss, war and heart which we just cant step away from. Visual art all the way through, from the massive mountains to small scale cities, TTT has something has everything that TFOTR had and much more. As i said in my first review, you develop a love for the characters which are fighting for the good of middle earth. After all thats happening from all the bloodshed and walking that takes place, you forget the realism to the film; it notches into you when you least expect, giving you a full taste that no one is invincible, and everyone is mortal. Heart renching moments occur many times in the film, some uplifting and some devestating enough to draw you to tears. Again, oscar nominated acting, which isnt really surprising; not being noticed for what it achieves, is. In my opinion, the most underated of the trilogy. Setting the concrete of the final battle for the ring, and again leaving you with a gaping mouth wide open and a feeling of wanting to watch more. Underated and completely mindblowing in sequences, this second part contains as much heart as the first film and a blast of power that the ring can have on you. Remember that feeling when you left the cinema, and having to wait another year for the final part. It was unbearable."
"Feb 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,"My favorite of the trilogy, it has the best and most memorable moments,"
"Feb 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,"My personal favourite of the series, has the greatest battle out of all three. This is part of one of the greatest trilogies of all time and these movies are among the greatest."
"Feb 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The journey of Frodo and Sam continues. Elsewhere, the army of Soramon attacked Rohan; the much feared war between good and evil has finally begun. Sauron is getting stronger as the ring is getting close to him. The power of the ring is weakening Frodo;  still, he doesn't surrender to the evil. He survives....

Though each of these sequels is extremely lengthy, there's not a chance to get bored; actually, it's almost impossible to stop watching till the very end."
"Feb 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,I rewatched it again today.. I wasn't wrong when I fell in love with this movie the first time I watched it
"Feb 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The epicness continues. Another great LOTR movie from Peter Jackson and crew. Personally, I didn't find this one as compelling as the first one, maybe because it is the filler between the beginning and the end. I'm not saying it's bad or anything, I just liked the first one better. The acting was great, the special effects, especially in the Battle for Helms Deep, are absolutely amazing. It always amazes me with these movies, how they can take something that is frankly a really long book, and turn it into such an epic tale of the Ring. A must see in the trilogy, obviously."
"Feb 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,Worst out of the three but still unbelievable
"Feb 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,"my personal favorite of the trilogy, JUST for the Ents and The Battle of Helms Deep. I probably can't say much about these films that others haven't said a thousand times already, but I'll say that they have aged remarkably well; they use massive amounts of CGI, but also plenty of practical makeup and effects, which combine to make the fantasy more convincing. wonderful, wonderful movie."
"Feb 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Follows on from Fellowship with spectacular action, acting and effects, to help render Tolkien's source material into a perfect second film in Jackson's masterful franchise! Its hard not to get caught up in all of it. Simply marvelous."
"Feb 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,"I can't praise this movie enough. From one of the best openings of all time as Gandalf battles the Balrog, to the grandeur of the plains of Rohan and culminating in the epic Battle of Helm's Deep. It's this battle that is one of the few occasions where the film actually outshines the book. The setting, sound, music, editing, it's all first class.
The main reason this movie sits above Fellowship though is Gollum. An incredible blend of the acting of Andy Serkis and CGI trickery makes for one of the most pivotal characters coming to life. He is fascinating to watch and as far as I'm concerned, portrays Tolkien's creation exactly.
This is the Best Picture Oscar winner of the three and an absolute masterpiece of modern cinema."
"Feb 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,"This is not a sequel, but merely just chapter two of a great epic trilogy. The fight actions, especially in the final battle were spectacular. This film was not as slow as the first film but was faster paced, which I did not know was possible for a three hour film. I believe this film was actually the best one of the trilogy, from the writing, acting, directing, and the cinematography. It gets lost in the shuffle because it is not the beginning nor the end of the series. If any film of the three deserved the Best Picture, it was this one. Great scenery and plot lines, not to mention the internal conflict of both Gollum and Frodo as they near Mount Doom. Great film."
"Feb 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,Visonary but formulaic.
"Feb 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,my fav of the series
"Feb 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,I so wish more films were like this
"Feb 10, 2012",NEUTRAL,God was I happy when I saw that this was the best reviewed of the 3 on here. It is by far the best in terms of battles and character development. It also has the best soundtrack (the Rohan Theme is amazing).
"Feb 10, 2012",NEUTRAL,"whoaaaaaa! I definitely accept to myself that I love the movie before I don't like this but when my hubby show this, I really appreciate the concept of the movie. ;-)"
"Feb 9, 2012",NEUTRAL,"I love this movie! I am a huge LOTR fan, and this movie is terrific! Peter Jackson did a wonderful job. There was one main difference. The character of Faramir was much darker than in the book, and I can't see why he had to be. Either way though, the movie's just as good. Bravo!"
"Feb 9, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Kampen om ""Middle Earth"" er begynt og for en kamp. Denne filmen er et aldri sÃ¥ lite kunstverk."
"Feb 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Better than 'Fellowship', but still far off the epic masterpiece status it is hailed to be."
"Feb 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,I love Watching war on film and i think this has one of the best war scenes i've ever seen
"Feb 7, 2012",NEUTRAL,epic still building and really good movie
"Feb 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,Visually spectacular and lots of action.  Only complaint is that there was a lot of time spent walking which can give it an air of slowness
"Feb 5, 2012",NEUTRAL,"I do not know whether this film does justice to its source material, partly because: 1) film and literature are completely different media, and 2) I have not read any of the novels yet (and I probably never will.) Even after spending almost 6 hours in the middle-earth, I still find it difficult to keep up with everything that's happening in this world. Too many characters, too many white races with no distinct features (with the exception of Elves), too many complicated names of regions and stuff in general, which make it challenging for me to take the story seriously. But around half way through the film, I realized that I shouldn't take it too seriously. Hell, this a fantasy film, with magic and Orcs and dwarves and all kinds of unrealistic shit, so I decided to just go with it. The result is quite spectacular and a really good time. Peter Jackson, once again, succeeds in telling this epic tale of bravery and sacrifice; terrific special effects, exquisite production design, and all-around strong performances make this installment an wildly entertaining ride. It's not without flaws and there are a couple of ridiculous and deliberately dramatic moments that made my eyes roll, but in the end it made me yearn for the final chapter. The Two Towers is damn entertaining."
"Feb 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Middle entries can be tricky, but this film with its darker tone (than the previous installment) is great. The Battle of Helms Deep is simply amazing."
"Feb 2, 2012",NEUTRAL,"I am a huge Tolkien fan and The Lord of the Rings is my favourite book by far. This is by far the best of The Lord of the Rings and in other words just astounding. In this Frodo continues his quest deeper into Mordor, with Sam by his side and Gollum has now joined the party, do they dare trust him. Whilst all this is happening, the allies have to fight the growing armies of Saruman the White or fall in the attempt. This film has adventure, action and battles on epic scales, which includes the battle of Helms Deep, which is my favourite scene. Not without its flaws, but after all, Lord of the Rings is a hard book to turn into a movie. This film is very faithful to the original story and is brimming with great actors, for me it captures the book really well."
"Feb 1, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Just like several great series, The Lord of the Rings, present a surprising and exciting sequel of this spectacular tale. With a terrific acting by Andy Serkis as Gollum."
"Feb 1, 2012",NEUTRAL,The best between the 3 chapters
"Jan 31, 2012",NEUTRAL,"It still has some of the adventure and discovery of the first, with the darkness and emotional resonance of its next installment. Personally, because of this balance, it's my favourite in the trilogy"
"Jan 30, 2012",NEUTRAL,One of my all time favorites
"Jan 22, 2012",NEUTRAL,The ents were pretty cool.
"Jan 21, 2012",NEUTRAL,"I lied, this is the best of the LOTR trilogy."
"Jan 20, 2012",NEUTRAL,Added a bit more excitement to the story.
"Jan 20, 2012",NEUTRAL,"It just keeps getting better, once again a remarkable book makes for a fantastic film."
"Jan 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,It's all about the final film
"Jan 18, 2012",NEUTRAL,"my favorite, can't get enough"
"Jan 18, 2012",NEUTRAL,When you're older you'll be telling your children the story of Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee.
"Jan 18, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Not QUITE as good as the first, but a fantastic piece nonetheless!"
"Jan 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,Twin towers wow's. Absolutely amazing.
"Jan 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,Just one thing... they're taking the hobbits to Isengard.
"Jan 17, 2012",NEUTRAL,will you marry me legolas?
"Jan 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Should've been called ""The 3 Towers""...for the 2 in the movie and the 1 in my pants."
"Jan 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Loved the Trilogy, but this is perhaps the weakest of the 3 movies. They turned a single chapter ""Helm Deep"" into a major battle that took over half the movie to tell. This is an example of why the Tolkien family was not happy with the movies. J.R.R. would be rolling in his grave."
"Jan 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,best of the trilogy!
"Jan 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Honestly, I think this one is just as good as the third one. The fellowship was a tamer, less exciting installment while this one certainly entertains and  excites with its great directing."
"Jan 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,I love Lord of the Ring Movies!!
"Jan 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,They walk and walk and walk and walk...
"Jan 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,Best of the Trilogy!
"Jan 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,it was an ok movie. my kids liked it
"Jan 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Great movie. Beautiful cinematography, excellent visuals, and very good acting from the cast."
"Jan 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,It may be the bridge between the first and last films but it still counts as a masterpeice in itself as it successfully introduces new characters and locations
"Jan 12, 2012",NEUTRAL,My favorite of the trilogy
"Jan 11, 2012",NEUTRAL,"While The Two Towers certainly has more action than its predecessor, it's much less fun going along for the ride. Andy Serkis as Gollum/Smeagol is brilliant in proving that an actor can turn in a great performance as a CG character, he steals every scene he's in. The battle of Helm's deep is a master class in large-scale action scenes that rivals some of the action in Star Wars but Jackson does a nice job of not getting carried away and forgetting the storyline. A great entry to the adventure genre but almost too dark to really be a fun watch."
"Jan 11, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The Fellowship is scattered across Middle Earth:  Merry & Pippin in the hands of the orcs, Aragorn Legalos & Gimli on their trail, and Frodo & Sam marching on to Mt. Doom.  The Two Towers feels very much like a middle film, but it also happens to be my favorite of the bunch.  This is where despair becomes an option for our heroes, but thankfully we've got Sam & Aragorn to battle for hope--AND we've got the visuals of cinema's greatest battle, Helm's Deep.  Plus, you've got the introduction of the sad, treacherous Gollum.  VF."
"Jan 11, 2012",NEUTRAL,Enjoyed it but it's one of those movies I can only watch once it's way too long and drawn out lol smh!
"Jan 9, 2012",NEUTRAL,definitely has the lack of resolution that any middle film of a trilogy has... but it's lotr.
"Jan 9, 2012",NEUTRAL,There is nothing wrong with this series. Flawless filmmaking.
"Jan 9, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Well saw parts of it, but couldn't wait until it was over. The Packers were whopping on the Vikings so I had to leave the room to watch the game!"
"Jan 9, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The best of the three films, The Two Towers has a great cinematic quality. The climax is beautifully orchestrated, and the pacing is fairly good. But the best part of the movie is the thorough characterization."
"Jan 9, 2012",NEUTRAL,The Lord of the Rings Trilogy defines the word epic!
"Jan 9, 2012",NEUTRAL,This is where it all starts to fall into place
"Jan 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The battle scenes in this movie are enough to warrant at least four stars, then add in the excellent acting, and intense atmosphere, interesting characters, and you got five stars"
"Jan 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Pretty much everything the first movie has to offer and more, including Andy Serkis doing an excellent job as Gollum!  Jackson really nailed the details in this movie!"
"Jan 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,"If you take the music, visual effects and make up out it wouldn't be that impressive movie. With a linear narrative, predictable ending and a regular cast, Lord of the Rings trio is highly over-ratted. However, if you were in love with the theme or if you ever played WOW (no offence) and liked it, you would most likely sanctify this movie."
"Jan 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,"sooo long
best scene: when it finishes"
"Jan 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The Road goes ever on with The Two Towers. The second film in the lord of the rings trilogy. Now as we split into three storys of the broken fellowship as Frodo and Sam continue to Mordor to destroy the ring as they meet upon Gollum who tries to split their relationship apart. Aragon, Legolas and Gimli are taking villagers as to Minus Turth as later, Merry and Pippin encounter Treebeard and try to get to get to Isengard. As you might find weird pauses throughout the film, the film itself is still fantastic to look at. 

95/100 A"
"Jan 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,"not the best one but still, it was good all the same."
"Jan 7, 2012",NEUTRAL,amazing amazing amazing
"Jan 7, 2012",NEUTRAL,"I love the Tollken Trilogy! All of the movies are fantastic. Great acting, script stayed true to books, and scenery and special effects are awesome!"
"Jan 7, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The second Lord of the Rings movies for me was nearly disappointing as the second sequel to in the second Star Wars trilogy. The movie was far too long and really did not carry the story really well. The movie had some great scenes and some excellent visuals, but falls flat in all other aspects."
"Jan 7, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Long, but incredible."
"Jan 7, 2012",NEUTRAL,How is Chicago better than this?
"Jan 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,I doubt it if there will ever be another trilogy of movies as epic as these are.
"Jan 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,"As it was in The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers brought a fantastic spectacle in continuation of where it left off :)"
"Jan 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Although pissed they don't end the movie in the same fashion as they do the books, I love the suprises and challenges faced in this part of the trilogy."
"Jan 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,Awesome special effects and storytelling
"Jan 5, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Alright, ROTK might be the best of the series, but this my favourite. Epic action, huge improvement upon Fellowship, great scenes of humour and at times a little scary, even. A success on every level."
"Jan 5, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Go watch it, but of course... Watch the first one first."
"Jan 5, 2012",NEUTRAL,Oh yeah! my favorite the best
"Jan 4, 2012",NEUTRAL,another great epic flick!
"Jan 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,I love this movie and I think i watch this LOTR movie the most.
"Jan 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The film is already perfect, but the extra 30 minutes just add even more depth and story. The extended versions are really the only way to go."
"Jan 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Though a few details from the book series are removed in this portion, it's surprisingly better than the first of the trilogy. It's a great continuation and even more so leaves its audience wishing for more, wanting to see how it will all end."
"Jan 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Casting was beautiful, and I think it was made perfectly"
"Jan 2, 2012",NEUTRAL,"The creatures and characters which were conjured up in my mind as my dad read The Fellowship of the Ring, complete with voices and gestures, will remain with me forever. This is the challenge Peter Jackson was left with in creating the first in his Lord of the Rings trilogy: the collective imagination of literally millions of fans, each one filled with different intricacies and opinions concerning characters, settings, basically everything involved in production design and being a director in general. With such a burden weighing on Jackson's shoulders, no one would have blamed him if he simply curled into the foetal position and sobbed when he actually bagged the role of director. But I'm sure I speak for fans, critics and the entire world when I say that I'm so glad that he didn't. The first in the sweeping epic of the Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring begins with the origin of the one ring; an object created by the dark lord Sauron in order to take over Middle Earth. After a battle sequence or two, we join up with our hero of the piece; Frodo Baggins, a Hobbit from the Shire. After finding out that his Uncle Bilbo's magic ring is in fact the ring in question, it's an adventure of a lifetime."
"Dec 31, 2011",NEUTRAL,"In my personal opinion, this is by far the best of the trilogy.  It advances in the story in such a more interesting way.  The atmosphere is more darker than the others."
"Dec 30, 2011",NEUTRAL,LOVE ALL THE LORD OF THE RINGS!!!!
"Dec 29, 2011",NEUTRAL,"""Two Towers"" switches back and forth between the adventures of the various characters which kept me from being completely emotionally invested with any of them. Still, the tale is thrilling and the visual are breathtaking. Peter Jackson juggles the many characters extremely well and creates a film that is more solid and consistently entertaining compared to ""Fellowship"". Three hours just went by like that."
"Dec 29, 2011",NEUTRAL,"I watchd this movie and didn't want to blink. I thought the movie was absolutely brilliant. It picked up greatly with the characters and made me interested to keep interested. The thing about this movie was that I was also interested in the music. The soundtrack of this movie was beautiful. I had never really listen to the soundtrack until this one. 
Wonderful movie, helms deep is thrilling battle."
"Dec 29, 2011",NEUTRAL,"I watched all 3 of these movies in the span of a week, and I honestly don't remember one thing about what makes this movie different from the other two.  It's all just a blurry 10 hours of the same crap."
"Dec 29, 2011",NEUTRAL,"peter jackson cant help but make epic films. great job of making the beloved books of tolkien and putting it on screen. the action, the acting, the detail! perfect!"
"Dec 29, 2011",NEUTRAL,Followed the book really well and was a good sequel to the first movie.
"Dec 28, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The movie was really good, it was just a little confusing and the movie was to long."
"Dec 28, 2011",NEUTRAL,I highly recommend the Blu-ray extended edition.
"Dec 28, 2011",NEUTRAL,The Two Towers is everything what the first film was and needed to be. Thanks to great work from in front of the camara and behind it. Overall The Two Towers is everything that the series needs and more.
"Dec 28, 2011",NEUTRAL,"My favorite of the trilogy, timeless."
"Dec 28, 2011",NEUTRAL,Second movie in the greatest trilogy of all time.
"Dec 27, 2011",NEUTRAL,good but not accurate.
"Dec 27, 2011",NEUTRAL,My favorite out of Harry Potter and Star Wars.
"Dec 27, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The second entry in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy has the Fellowship splitting into three groups as they continue their journey to the only place in the world where they can destroy the powerful ring. Among the new allies that accompany the members of the Fellowship are a creature named Gollum (Andy Serkis) who once used the Ring and a walking, talking tree named Treebeard (John Rhys-Davies). Although it has some of the same flaws as The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King, The Two Towers easily ranks as the best in the series and that is due in large part to John Rhys-Davies' performance as the bloodthirsty dwarf Gimli who steals every scene that he is in."
"Dec 27, 2011",NEUTRAL,a great film with great action effects heart a epic score a great movie for everyone
"Dec 27, 2011",NEUTRAL,"4.5 - Part two in the LOTR saga improves on every aspect over the first one. particularly in pacing and variety, as The Two Towers features an interesting multi-threaded story that leads to an excellent stand-off between the forces of evil wizard Saruman (Lee) and humanity. Peter Jackson's own SFX company, Weta, gets to really shine in conjuring up such a vivid world filled with all manner of beasts and fantastic buildings, but very special mention must go to the character of Gollum, who is the result of a superb (and pioneering) motion capture performance by Andy Serkis. Lots to see."
"Dec 26, 2011",NEUTRAL,I like all the action
"Dec 26, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Gag kalah sama film pertama, film kedua juga keren. Banyak humor antara si Gimli dan Legolas, contohnya pas mereka menghitung jumlah orc yg berhasil mereka bunuh di Hels Deep). Di film yg kedua ini menceritakan tentang pertarungan besar antara pasukan Sauron dan pasukan Rohan. Gila pasukannya, super duper buanyak... gimana syutingnya tuch, pasti gag mudah buat mengkordinir orang sebanyak itu, mempersiapkan kostum dan make up nya, serta membangun menaranya, wuih.... saluuuut.... Banyak tokoh baru yg muncul disini (khususnya orang2 dari kerajaan Rohan, seperti Lady Eowyn, Eomer, Faramir, dll.)."
"Dec 26, 2011",NEUTRAL,"What issues I'd had with the Fellowship of the Ring have been more than made up for in The Two Towers, the second installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Frodo and Sam are off on their own to continue their treacherous journey to Mordor; Merry and Pippin have been captured by the demonic Uruk-Hai; and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are hot on their trail. This film is a grandiose action adventure film like they gave us back in the distant days of an older, coded Hollywood system. There is everything in this picture, and it is at a much more deliberate, yet never tedious pace. Watching the extended version of the film, it clocks in at just under four hours, yet I was ready and nearly willing to pop in the third and final chapter except that doing so would cost me another four hours of time and I don't have eight hours in a day which I can devote solely to watching movies."
"Dec 26, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Elves at the Battle of Helm's Deep?

Despite generally superb performances by this movie's strong cast, Peter Jackson committed an unforgivable sin in his butchery of Tolkien's classic novel in this adaptation.  I enjoyed most of it (when I wasn't being offended by the liberties Jackson took).  The dialogue between Elrond and Arwen is especially good--moving, convincing, poingiant, even brilliant, but Tolkien deserves the credit for that, not Jackson.  At least Jackson had the good sense to preserve this dialogue, unlike in Return of the King, which he butchered even more severely by omitting some of the best dialogue from the novel.

Fresh, yes, but not nearly as good as it could have been."
"Dec 26, 2011",NEUTRAL,"My favorite of the trilogy! The design alone is beautiful, along with great actors and special effects. It can't get better than this."
"Dec 26, 2011",NEUTRAL,The picturesque setting and the convincing acting often made me forget I'm watching a fantasy film..such compelling performances by the whole cast that it does not make us feel its a dramatization.
"Dec 25, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The two towers follows after the fellowship of the ring and dilivers some good jokes, and you will like the two towers better than the fellowship of the ring."
"Dec 25, 2011",NEUTRAL,i certainly enjoy these flicks
"Dec 23, 2011",NEUTRAL,"this wasnt the best, yet it wasnt the worst. it is really really good still. i loved it i strongly reccomedn anyone, also must go see movie. its just that there were things missing from it. and i felt it wasnt as good as the first one or the 3rd one. also i thought it was a little slow some parts"
"Dec 23, 2011",NEUTRAL,"If you read my review on The Fellowship of the Ring, you'll know exactly what i think of this one. The only difference is that this time, i get to see a clash, not a few on many battle, and i like it."
"Dec 23, 2011",NEUTRAL,"long but watch it over again, & again"
"Dec 22, 2011",NEUTRAL,"epic, strong willed, and has the greatest battle scene in history"
"Dec 22, 2011",NEUTRAL,Great action and amazing story.
"Dec 21, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Compared to the Fellowship and the Return of the King, this movie is pretty bad. But it isn't a bad movie, it's very good; but the weakest of the trilogy.

Grade: B+"
"Dec 21, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Watching it right now, it's awesome!"
"Dec 21, 2011",NEUTRAL,Dissapointed after how good the first was. Still a well done film.
"Dec 21, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The acting is magnificent and the visuals are as thrilling as ever. Beautifully directed by Peter Jackson, The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers reigns as a superb epic fantasy film that should not be missed by any Tolkien's fans."
"Dec 21, 2011",NEUTRAL,It's characters are too two dimensional for me to care.
"Dec 20, 2011",NEUTRAL,I can't even imagine how ridiculous the production of this movie must have been.

;)"
"Dec 18, 2011",NEUTRAL,A solid improvement on The Fellowship.  The Two Towers offers brilliantly dramatic directing and visually impressive action sequences.
"Dec 17, 2011",NEUTRAL,The movie is loaded with epic battles scenes but i never thought for once it sacrificed story for action. Tough call to pick between this and the Fellowship for my favorite one of the series but if you put a gun to my head i'd probably pick this one.
"Dec 17, 2011",NEUTRAL,And more walking... and fighting... and walking... (see comments about Return of the King)
"Dec 15, 2011",NEUTRAL,"""The Two Towers"" perfectly bridges the differing styles of ""Fellowship"" and ""Return of the King"" with a much more laid back, brooding atmosphere while its most impacting events, typically epic battles, hit in large waves spaced evenly across the film."
"Dec 15, 2011",NEUTRAL,"As good as the first film, this one stepped it up a notch on the special affects front. Tolkein would be truly proud of Jackson's production of his most well known novels."
"Dec 15, 2011",NEUTRAL,This movie was sooooo exciting and now i cant get it off my mind
"Dec 14, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The Journey to destroy the ring Of Sauron Continues with the ring slowly taking over frodo , The second film in the Lord of the ring trilogy offers many highlights like Golum's first appearance but overall it's only the preparation for the epic finale in the third film.    7 / 10"

"Nov 15, 2011",NEUTRAL,Love this trilogy!!!
"Nov 14, 2011",NEUTRAL,THE BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME. No movies will ever surpass these movies. Peter Jackson did a freaking amazing job on them and I cannot wait for The Hobbit.
"Nov 13, 2011",NEUTRAL,i don't really like any of these movies but. . .
"Nov 13, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Ths movie turned out almost exactly like the books.  It is a fabulous movie.  Vigo did a great job, and seeing Sean Astin again was wonderful"
"Nov 13, 2011",NEUTRAL,Read my review here: http://www.nobadmovies.net/2011/01/lord-of-rings-trilogy.html
"Nov 13, 2011",NEUTRAL,"If you want to watch a movie, watch this one!"
"Nov 12, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Seems like a somewhat convenient story development.  The movie, though, fittingly cliff-hangs and pulls no punches that Part III is where you need to be."
"Nov 12, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The only attempt that Hollywood adapted J.R.R. Tolkien's epic fantasy novels before the live-action films was in the form of a 1978 animation film that compressed all three novels in the span of 132 minutes. A decade later, director Peter Jackson made his name as part of Hollywood's elite directors with the live-action adaptation of the novels that were filmed back-to-back-to-back in Jackson's native New Zealand and released one year after the other around the holidays. With the visual and makeup effects to create the fantasy world of Middle Earth, the film also featured an outstanding ensemble that include Eiljah Wood as Frodo, Oscar-nominee Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Oscar-nominee Viggo Mortensen as Aragon. Howard Shore's score can go down as one of the most recognizable score of all time. The visual effects and the action sequences during the big battle is one of the highlights of the trilogy. Andy Serkis' performance as Gollum is truly the best performance in the trilogy thanks to motion capture technology."
"Nov 9, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers, be it the extended version or theatrical cut, is as perfect a fantasy epic as this feeble mind can imagine, and as perfect a cinematic adaptation of Tolkien's work (""cinematic,"" not ""staunchly faithful,"" mind you) as The Fellowship of the Ring. Jackson's films will always have their critics; even The Two Towers, arguably the most beloved and critically acclaimed of the three. But I remain amazed. Not just by the film itself, but by its ability to continue speaking to me after so many viewings, to continue drawing viewers to its fold after so many years, to still stand so high above every fantasy film and franchise that's arrived in its wake."
"Nov 8, 2011",NEUTRAL,"You could call it the greatest achievement in cinema history. A staggering, colossal experience that towers (see all the huge words I'm using here) above all the rest in its genre, filled to the brim with unforgettable characters, spectacular battles and unsurpassed overall epic-ness, The Lord of the Rings is just about as good as it gets"
"Nov 7, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The best in the trilogy without a doubt! The performances are amped up, (though sadly Ian McKellen is not quite as memorable) the visuals are a sheer delight, and the battle sequences are breathtaking!"
"Nov 7, 2011",NEUTRAL,The lord of the ring films are cool but if you have read the book they are a little lame.
"Nov 5, 2011",NEUTRAL,"This viewers personal favorite film in the trilogy with the way it builds towards a spectacular finish. The battle of Helms Deep is, in my opinion, the greatest battle ever created in movies. The emotional attachment to characters is heightened even further and from a film making standpoint, Jackson continues to astound on a technical level."
"Nov 5, 2011",NEUTRAL,"It didn't impress me as much as Fellowship of the Ring, but it is still a marvelous follow-up that fails to make a costly mistake. The battle scenes accompanied by Christian allegories could have carried the entire film, as well as the addition of Smeegul, who is more than likely the most diabolical villian in all of cinema as he sets out to steal the ""precious""."
"Nov 4, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The masterpiece continues. It gets more desperate and becomes a great, epic swashbuckler along the way."
"Nov 4, 2011",NEUTRAL,Nice battles and almost interesting conversations. Very well done.
"Nov 1, 2011",NEUTRAL,"While this is definitely my least favorite of the LOTR films, it is still very watchable."
"Oct 31, 2011",NEUTRAL,for certain edits there is no excuse
"Oct 27, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Phenomenal performances, directing, special effects. damn near everything is impeccable in this Lord of the Rings sequel"
"Oct 1, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The Series goes on perfectly. With confidence Peter Jackson, he continues to relive this movie."
"Sep 30, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Could have been better, let's be honest guys."
"Sep 30, 2011",NEUTRAL,"My favorite of the three films, the Two Towers doubles my love of Lord of the Rings. Peter Jackson sure knew what he was doing. I cannot see a reason why anyone would not like this film."
"Sep 27, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Not as strong as the first one, but the end leaves you going WOO!! WOO!!"
"Sep 25, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Better than the first,the darkness is amplified and the story is better put"
"Sep 23, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Definitely the high point of the trilogy. Like Empire Strikes Back, it has a sense of bleakness about it, but you hope that things will turn out better. It does a really good job at tugging on your heart."
"Sep 18, 2011",NEUTRAL,I give the same review to this film as the other two movies of this trilogy.
"Sep 17, 2011",NEUTRAL,One of the best films I've ever had the pleasure of watching.
"Sep 17, 2011",NEUTRAL,Greatest movies of all time
"Sep 17, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Peter Jackson left the entire world on a cliffhanger when he finished The Fellowship of the Ring. After having done such an impressive job with the first film and then having the balls to stay true to the source by finishing as he did, he was almost setting himself up to fail; giving himself a task even greater than the original undertaking: a sequel. Not just any sequel; a sequel to film being touted as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made and himself being declared a genius. This sort of hype is almost impossible to live up to. Almost.

Taking up where its predecessor left off, The Two Towers follows Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas as they chase down a troop of Uruk-Hai, Frodo and Sam as they journey further towards Mordor and Merry and Pippin as they, well, get into lots of trouble.

The story is much more divided in comparison to the first of the series with a fellowship of nine journeying together rather than three different groups and their various shenanigans. This is the first challenge to overcome for filmmaker Peter Jackson: how to tell all these stories in under four hours? Not only that, but how to allot time to the different storylines without 1) making it boring and 2) losing focus on the main story which just happens to be the more boring aspect of the source material: Frodo and Sam's trek towards Mordor. After all, how inventive can one director be with half the story taking up by two diminutive figures walking towards a place which they don't actually reach by the time the films finishes?

It's almost as if Jackson hasn't noticed these issues as the second film is just as fulfilling and story-driven as the first without sacrificing any major plot points or basically getting rid of anything that would cause a fan outcry. Yes, technically the ents do show up to help at the battle of Helm's Deep and no we don't get to see Merry and Pippin in Treebeard's house or talking to Quickbeam but in the end, Peter Jackson has conquered these seemingly mammoth tasks with ease. This is a reflection on Jackson's instinct for pace, as the extended edition shows that these time-consuming though unnecessary scenes were in fact filmed, but were left on the editting floor. Jackson's fearlessness with the source material yet mindfullness of it as well means that the story is left completely intact; enough to appease any fan. Jackson has also made room for the lighter moments as well, revelling in the joy of discovery when Merry and Pippin first encounter Treebeard and having time for jokes between the double-act which just keeps getting better of Legolas and Gimli. Jackson doesn't forget about his characters either, keeping the film from feeling hollow by introducing the beautiful Miranda Otto as never-to-be love interest Eowyn and the abandoned-by-his-country Eomer as well as extending his existing characters in Merry and Pippin who only get more endearing, Frodo and Sam whose seemingly unflappable relationship is beginning to show some strain. And even though Gandalf's character goes under a major revamp he's still the same enigmatic mentor as before, albeit slightly more badass. It's this attention to detail which makes Peter Jackson's work so watchable, all the way through the crazy runtime.

Shore's score is as strong as ever, this time bringing the beautiful theme of the world of men to the fore. Shore's understanding of motif and mood is pivotal here, even more so than Fellowship as the story isn't as driving as its predecessor. Because of this, Shore's score is able to ferry us through the slower moments and throughout the entire film.

The performances here are just as textured as they were in the first film. Not only that, but the sequel factor means that actors are able to loosen up a little more, in particular in the case of Orlando Bloom's Legolas and John Rhys-Davies' Gimli. The two of them have more fun than it should be possible to have in an epic of this size and they pull it off without ever feeling camp or not taking it seriously enough. Ian McKellen's Gandalf is still the standout of the series but it's great to see the rest of the cast becoming more and more involved in their characters. Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn is one of the performances which shows a lot of progression. His presence has more gravitas in this one and his character is more layered than the original; more difficult to read. Elijah Wood has much less to do in this film, leaving him to keep mostly the same expression on his face for most of the film. While this may be true to story, it does occassionally make you wish that he had something else to do than walk around some rocks for a while. Sean Astin's Sam is similarly beleagured and while their parts of the film are integral to the story, you sometimes wish that we'd move back to the interesting parts a little sooner. Bernard Hill makes a great addition to the cast as Theoden as well as his onscreen daughter Eowyn played with fragile strength by Miranda Otto. Brad Dourif's Grima Wormtongue is fantastic; a slimy, manipulative groveller who snivells perfectly through every scene he's in.

Another of Towers' achievements lies in another of its new characters: Gollum. Gollum is a completely CG creation, performed by Andy Serkis with groundbreaking technology, enabling Serkis to interact with the actual actors and thus makes the performances all the more real. This innovation makes for incredible viewing as one of the more unfilmmable sections of Tolkien's work is brought to life onscreen. Serkis' performance is largely discounted in terms of acting accolades but it's incredible to see. His work here set the benchmark for motion capture.

But all these technical factors fade into the background at the Battle of Helm's Deep: a battle scene so epic that it drowns out everything that comes before it. Ten thousand Uruk-Hai facing off against Rohan's much depleted forces is so overwhelming that it makes it difficult to spot any kind of flaws in the rest of the film. Jackson seamlessly blend CG with fantastic costume and makeup to create an entirely believeable all out war which lives up to the scenes detailed in the book and revells in the little moments like Legolas riding a shield down some stairs or a rousing speech from King to King. Jackson's sense of pace throughout the battle is fantastic, moving from the Entmoot to Sam and Frodo without ever losing momentum. And the coup-de-grace of Gandalf's arrival is as breathtaking a moment as the series brings in any of its three films.

While this may be the weaker cinematically of the three films, the fact that I'm still giving it five stars shows you just how high the bar is set for this series. The fact is that, despite lacking the grandeur of the third and the sense of wonder and scariness of the first, it's still a better film than 90% of the blockbusters Hollywood vomits up on regular basis. Truly incredible filmmaking.

Defining Scene:
The Battle at Helm's Deep. Of course.

Quotes:
Stupid fat hobbit.

What's happening out there?
Shall I describe it to you? Or would you like me to find you a box?

They're taking the hobbits to Isengard!"
"Sep 16, 2011",NEUTRAL,Probably the worst one of the trilogy but it is so close it doesn't even matter. It still deserves as much praise as the first one did continuing the best story of the decade.
"Sep 15, 2011",NEUTRAL,A bigger and more entertaining adventure.
"Sep 15, 2011",NEUTRAL,"meu pai é viciado nesse filme, eu até que gosto :)"
"Sep 14, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Possibly the best entry in the trilogy (although all three are so good and uniform that it is hard to say one if better than the other...they are essentially one long film).  Everything from the first film continues on here, with a few more epically fantastic CG battle scenes.  Andy Serkis as Gollum is fantastic, and probably one of the best uses of performance capture, at least up to this point.  CG can be amazing when the time and money is put into it and it is used properly."
"Sep 10, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The second film of the trilogy begins where the first left off. Frodo and Sam are now on there own, without their fellow hobbits Merry and Pippin who have been captured by the orcs of Sarumon's army; who ultimately escape and flee into the darkness of Fangorn Forrest. But Frodo and Sam don't know they're being followed by the lurking slime known as Smeagol, who wants his ""precious"" back once again. And Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are led to Rohan by Gandolf the White; who was presumed to have died in the first film, where King Theoden is being taken over by the evil powers of Sarumon. King Theoden's niece Ãowyn feels that Aragorn and his men have what it takes to defeat Sarumon's army with Rohan's army joining them in battle. Ãowyn ends up falling for Aragorn, but Aragorn doesn't know if he feels the same knowing he made his promise to return to Arwen. And with the battle between good and evil at the end, it just shows that Sauron's army will keep growing and Frodo and Sam need to keep moving. 'The Two Towers' is an amazing follow-up to 'Fellowship' and features the same ever-amazing cast and adding the new characters like King Theoden, Faramir, and the amazing Smeagol voiced by Andy Serkis. Peter Jackson's direction style really showed off in this chapter and made everyone excited for 'Return of the King', which rightfully deserved everyone one of it's 11 Oscars. People who aren't fans or haven't heard of LOTR should be aware of what they're missing out on; truly the movie experience of a lifetime."
"Sep 10, 2011",NEUTRAL,"I think it's the best of the three because it spends the most time with the most interesting characters (Sam and Gollum).  But, it's still too long and has too many superfluous characters."
"Sep 10, 2011",NEUTRAL,The king in the story is the Human warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen). But Peter Jackson is the true lord of these Rings.
"Sep 8, 2011",NEUTRAL,One of the best story's told on screen. All three are a must see for any film fan
"Sep 6, 2011",NEUTRAL,"After the first one's ending, it picks up right after and continues the epic fantasy adventure. The visuals, introduction of new characters (ie: Gollum), more breathtaking battle scenes, and an equally intriguing story makes this adventure another peice of genius work. The music soundtrack is also breathtaking as the movie prolongs. (NOTE: This about the extended version)"
"Sep 6, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The best overall chapter of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, the film (particularly the extended edition) provides phenomenal character development, jaw-dropping cinematography, and thrilling battle sequences. The Battle of Helm's Deep is a highlight of cinema, a classic heroic stand against evil."
"Sep 5, 2011",NEUTRAL,The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers follows on from The Fellowship of the Ring no trouble at all.
"Sep 5, 2011",NEUTRAL,"It's drags on sometimes but it leads perfectly and the build up is really hard-hitting, it's flawless, just like the others."
"Sep 1, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Two towers is a great sequel that a good continuation of the fellowship of the ring.The plot is the sme but all the subplots and action keep this film engaging.What is really great is the two towers allows characters to grow from the original like empire strikes back.The special effects are amazing,the design of gollum,the walking trees is astounding.The makeup effects of the orcs and goclins is allows good.The action in this is spectacular.In particular the battle sequence at helms deep.If you haven't seen a lord of the rings movie your missing out."
"Aug 31, 2011",NEUTRAL,Probably my favorite of the three
"Aug 31, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Despite seeing this first than the first one, I totally enjoyed despite a lot of sub-plots"
"Aug 31, 2011",NEUTRAL,Bad ass sequel. I think it's my favorite one.
"Aug 31, 2011",NEUTRAL,Bad ass sequel. I think it's my favorite one.
"Aug 31, 2011",NEUTRAL,The Two Towers is my favorite of the trilogy. 8.5/10
"Aug 31, 2011",NEUTRAL,"a perfect start for the final battle. everyone is now geared up on how it will all end. lotr:the two towers is a cunning, grandeur, amazing climax for the trilogy...  you wouldn't dare miss."
"Aug 29, 2011",NEUTRAL,"ohhhhhhhhhh baby, the Two Towers. This second part in Jackson film adaptation of JRR Tolkiens trilogy is outstanding. Once gain Jackson does not fail to bring every major important detail from the book into the big screen. The Helms Deep battle and the last march of the Ent's are to this day my two favorite battle scenes in all of cinema. at the end of the movie I found myself wondering how Jackson could top it with the Final part, The Return of the King. He would not dissapoint"
"Aug 29, 2011",NEUTRAL,Such GREAT movies! This one is no exception.
"Aug 29, 2011",NEUTRAL,The bridge scene was pretty ridiculous
"Aug 29, 2011",NEUTRAL,The best one out of the 3
"Aug 29, 2011",NEUTRAL,It has the best war scenes.
"Aug 28, 2011",NEUTRAL,I could not believe that a sequel can be that good. Even I felt that it was slightly better than the earlier one. The story concluded from the previous part and it have more wars going on which is a treat with marvelous CG effects. This time the pace was faster than the Fellowship of The Ring. The same efforts from Peter Jackson are clearly visible. Again everyone has done a great job in their respective acts. I could easily watch the extended version without getting bored. The character of Gollum is quite interestingly made fit in the story.  The battle of Isengard is what this one is wholly about. Its quite a lengthy war but its one of the jaw-dropper. Overall I think again every technical aspect touched almost perfection. Although I feel this one was better a little still I don't feel like giving it a perfect 10. Again a must watch.
"Aug 27, 2011",NEUTRAL,There's a lot of action and it's pretty easy to keep watching. Despite the fact that it's 3 hours long
"Aug 27, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Let me just say, I hate Gollum. I feel no sympathy for him whatsoever, however his place in The Two Towers is beyond important. Whatever the case, the movie is just as amazing as the Fellowship."
"Aug 26, 2011",NEUTRAL,If you thought the lord of the rings couldn't get any more epic than you were wrong. Helms Deep was like the best war I've ever seen in a movie.....untill the return of the king lol
"Aug 25, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Better than the first, action packed, suspenseful and most importantly entertaining."
"Aug 23, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The second chapter is generally a great fantasy film with the same level as the previous chapter but greater in scale on effects and emotions as well being a little more serious. It's also a comparison to ""Star Wars Episode V"" in scales and setting things up for the next and final chapter. (A)

(Full review coming soon - with better wording and requires another viewing probably)"
"Aug 3, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Not as good as Return of the King or Fellowship. Just more walking to a volcano (See Clerks II, for reference)."
"Aug 3, 2011",NEUTRAL,I had never heard about this trilogy until I saw it in the teatres. Amazing!
"Aug 2, 2011",NEUTRAL,I personally thought this was the worst of the three movies
"Aug 1, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Just as epic as the first one!  Final Fantasy VI totally took from this story when they split up the resistance into three different sections.  This split however is what made the pacing staccato-like, but regardless still a great film.  Watch the special features so you can seriously appreciate the pain that this film crew endured to make this film."
"Aug 1, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Fun movie, long run time, left out a whole bunch of stuff from the book."
"Aug 1, 2011",NEUTRAL,Possibly better than the first.
"Aug 1, 2011",NEUTRAL,The glue between the first and the last. Loved it.
"Jul 31, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The worst of the Middle Earth films (until The Hobbit movies rolled around and shit really got awful). Just like its predecessor, this film is bland and indifferently acted, but also lacks the grand scope and epic feel that the first film brought."
"Jul 30, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The weakest of the three films, ""The Two Towers"" is saved mostly from Serkis's brilliant performance as Gollum. The rest of the film is rather repetitive, and the famous Battle of Helm's Deep is underwhelming compared to what comes in the next installment. Not a bad film, but not great."
"Jul 30, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Epic! The scale of this film is amazing. It has amazing graphics that still hold up ten years later, great landscapes, cool battles, and jam packed with emotion and feeling. Although LotR should be looked at collectively instead of individual films; but if I must; The Two Towers is a iconic fantasy film that absolutely should be seen by everyone. And the fact that these films run 3+ hours each is good thing since that means  the audience gets that much more content to sink our teeth into if that's your thing. If you embrace the scale of the trilogy and the rich-detailed lore that supports Middle Earth, then LotR provides 5 Star entertainment."
"Jul 30, 2011",NEUTRAL,I review that extended bluray version. Here there are no problems with the colour. Again thinking of original material the script is excellent but with some hiccups. The theme of justified is critized especially by Faramir but it seems this is halfbaked and would need some more reaching over the script. The character of Gollum / Smeagol is written excellently and the Faramir storyline gives some - yet a little bit halfbaked - bone: what principles are you willing to follow or let to go just to get approvement of your fathers? Overall actors do splendid work and I find soundtrack really good.
"Jul 29, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The LOTR series are outstanding, best fantasy movies of our times so far, and classics well into the future"
"Jul 28, 2011",NEUTRAL,"I don't really see this as a sequel, just as a continuation. Very good none-the-less. Be sure to watch the extended edition."
"Jul 27, 2011",NEUTRAL,If it's so great why am I so bored?
"Jul 25, 2011",NEUTRAL,The battle of Helmsdeep is unmatched.
"Jul 25, 2011",NEUTRAL,Same movie three times.
"Jul 25, 2011",NEUTRAL,More of the same from the first.
"Jul 25, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Unnecessarily long, cheesy dialog, & I felt quite disconnected from it throughout. Other than it's special effects & great production value, not much else going for it for me."
"Jul 25, 2011",NEUTRAL,Jackson gets the ball rolling and never stops... and I'm grateful for that!
"Jul 25, 2011",NEUTRAL,Absolutely brilliant in every way & the casting is inspired each charicter looked the image of their paintings in my Tolkien book
"Jul 24, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The second part in this trilogy was reminding me of the second part of the matrix movie or even the 1st part of the last harry potter movie its the in between you know that its not the ending but its going yo end on some kind of crescendo. Getting back to the Baha'i elements in this movie one of the characters say something along the lines ""what can men do against such reckless hate"" The response to this reminds me of Ruhi book 1 ""If a thought of war comes apose it with a stronger thought of peace if a thought of hate comes apose it with an even stronger thought of love"" I like that. Part 3 tomorrow ladies and gents :)"
"Jul 24, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Peter Jackson brings his A-game when with The Two Towers, improving upon the original and paving the way to the Return of the King."
"Jul 23, 2011",NEUTRAL,The second entry in the Lord of the Rings trilogy manages to surpass the first film in every way.  Packed with more adventure and action than the first.  Andy Serkis gives a very chilling performance as Gollum despite being in a motion-capture suit.  The battle of Helms Deep is pure awesomeness.
"Jul 23, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Greatest Movie(s) of all Time period! All 3 ! Great Cast ,Great Acting,Great Story,Great Action,Great Romance,Great Directing! Completely Glued to the screen everytime I watch them ..GOAT no doubt.The Trilogy is purely Perfection"
"Jul 22, 2011",NEUTRAL,"A part two of a trilogy that rivals ""The	Empire Strikes Back"". A great achievement."
"Jul 21, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Excellent, if just a bit melodramatic.  Made my nerdy heart happy, though."
"Jul 21, 2011",NEUTRAL,The high point of the series and perfectly positioning the finale.
"Jul 19, 2011",NEUTRAL,It follows the story with no problem.

"Jul 18, 2011",NEUTRAL,"I'm aware this is the best rated movie of the trilogy, yet it is my least favorite.
Why? Because of Peter Jackson.
Nevermind when Gandalf arrives in his white horse a la John Wayne or when the uruk hai runs with the torch as if he was going to light the olympic flame, hell, I might even be able to forgive the scene with Legolas and the skateboard like shield. 
The butchery of the story is what took it too far. King Theoden's character was done all sorts of wrong in this movie, the corny ass scene where Aragorn falls off and winds up back in the camp after his horse saves him as he holds Arwen's necklace was dripping syrup so corny it was, the relationship between Legolas and Gimli was turned around for the worst. I wasn't expecting it to be loyal to the book 100%, but you can't simply put stuff there that was meant the opposite way. And the worst part is that, for example, Theoden's character change and Gimli-Legolas relationship went back to how it was written in the third, so this one seems like an anomaly of sorts.
The cherry on top of the cake for me to dislike this movie is that Peter Jackson can't hide an infatuation he has with elves, infatuation that Tolkien didn't have, so he adds them in the Battle of Helm's Deep just because he wants elves there, even if it changes the actual story told in the book where it is a stand of humankind against Saruman, not humankind going to cower to caves while the elves come to save the day (something they don't do in the book trilogy, they are too busy leaving middle earth).
Visually, this movie is stunning and the ents were just like how I had imagined as a kid. Sadly, this is Peter Jackson's version of the books and how he reads em/enjoys them, not a movie about the book."
"Jul 18, 2011",NEUTRAL,Favorite of the trilogy.
"Jul 18, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers puts yet another trophy on the mantle of director Peter Jackson and his powerhouse cast and crew. It's darker, more epic, and ultimately, more engaging than the first movie. A fantastic film."
"Jul 17, 2011",NEUTRAL,A suitable change of gear. It worked!
"Jul 17, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The adventure continues, as Frodo and Sam venture across rugged lands carrying the One Ring. Elsewhere, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are out to find the captured Merry and Pippin. 
   With continued splendor and vast scope, Jackson gives us another faithful and awesome adaption of Tolkien's ""The Two Towers''. 
   Each actor does amazing, bringing each character to life. Gollum played by Andy Serkis delivers an astounding performance and advancement in technological achievement. 
   A perfect sequel, and deserving of every award the series eventually got."
"Jul 17, 2011",NEUTRAL,Siendo mi menos favorita de la trilogía...me gustó más en su versión extendida que la original ;_;
"Jul 17, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Best fantasy stuff ever, with thrilling parts, great pics and a nice cast."
"Jul 16, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The action is incredible, it is even in a way more thrilling than the fellowship of the ring, but the only problem with this movie is that in certain moemnts it turns very slowly."
"Jul 16, 2011",NEUTRAL,The movie was perfect the acting of the stars as well as the story line was magestic. This time around the movie carefully followed and depicted the events which occured in the book. There was no fault which I could personally find and I am delighted with the vision of Peter Jackson. Everyone should watch the movie as well as it predecessor and successor.
"Jul 15, 2011",NEUTRAL,Loved it. A huge LOTR fan.
"Jul 14, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Bei den vielen Schlachten schlafe ich zwar immer halb ein, aber ansonsten hat er mir gut gefallen."
"Jul 13, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Honestly, the greatest war scenes of any LOTR movies were seen in here! What a way to follow up the first film. And not spoiling a good story, The Two Towers kept it nice. Action was great! Great movie!"
"Jul 13, 2011",NEUTRAL,the into was just amazing...gandalf fighting a balrog...wha a fantastic scene...but my most fevorit scen is at the min of Moria...just fabulous...
"Jul 12, 2011",NEUTRAL,I have wanted to see this trilogy for a while & finally got to watch them!  Not only that but I watched the extended versions!  The first one was a bit slow for me but I have a short attention span & ADD!  It seemed like as the movies went on they got better & more exciting!  All in all I enjoyed them!  I'm not sure I'd sit through 12 hours of it again though...
"Jul 11, 2011",NEUTRAL,My favourite of the series
"Jul 10, 2011",NEUTRAL,"For what it's worth, this is a review on the extended edition.

I spent most of my review of Fellowship gushing over the production values, the actors, the music, the direction, cinematography, the sense of history, etc.  I'll save you the regurgitation of it here, and only mention that the same level of quality continues on into The Two Towers.

Where as Fellowship centered on a group of characters the entire running time, Two Towers has them split up into three groups.  The first consist of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, as they find themselves in Rohan, ""home to the Horse Lords.""  The Rohirrim are, I suppose, your typical, quaint villagers most commonly found in fantasy epics.  A little more beefed-up, history-wise, of course.  They're under direct threat of Saruman.  Lest you forgot, he strolls around his tower of Orthanc, building an army of super orcs (Uruk-hai) and burning the surrounding lands to make way for an industrial age.  Rohan's king, Theoden, is not willing to risk open war so he decides to evacuate his people to the fortress of Helm's Deep.  There, with Aragorn fighting by his side, he will make his last stand.

Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin find themselves in the company of a tree.  Well, if you want to get technical, an Ent (talking tree), named Treebeard.  I'd like to think his tree-parents had a sense of humor when naming him.  Anywho, Merry finds himself wanting to play a bigger role in the battle for Middle-Earth, so he pushes Treebeard and his Ent friends to go to war with Saruman.

Lastly, and most importantly as far as the one ring is concerned, Frodo and Sam make their way through Emyn Muil, the Dead Marshes and right up to the black gates of Mordor in their quest to cast the ring into the fires of Mount Doom.  It doesn't take them long to get lost, but they find a guide in Smeagol/Gollum, the previous owner of the ring (before Bilbo) and another tragic figure in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Aragorn and the plight of Rohan take center stage in this film, and that's all fine and dandy.  The introduction of Rohan and much of its inhabitants make for a welcome change of pace.  Theoden King tends to babble on a bit much about . . . everything, but finally acts with some balls come the film's finale.  There's also a love interest introduced in Eowyn, the king's niece.  It's not much of a love story, mind you, as Aragorn's heart still belongs to Arwen, but it's an interesting angle none-the-less.  I also mentioned last time that the characters of Gimli and Legolas got the short end of the stick.  Here, they're fleshed out a bit more.  Sure, Legolas is given most of the token bad-ass moments, and Gimli is the comic relief . . . but for the most part it works because come the end of the film, you really do enjoy the two and their constant game of trying to one up each other, even in battle.  Of course, Gandalf plays more of an extended cameo in this flick, but he's always a welcome addition.

Merry and Pippin unfortunately have most of the boring stuff, right up to the climax.  Ents are deliberately slow creatures, and right when the movie is in the middle of something interesting, sometimes it will cut to these guys and the pace slows to a crawl.  Still, there's a great moment towards the end when the Ents march on the tower of Orthanc and ""fuck up Saruman's shit,"" so to speak.  It's the ultimate act of nature vs industry, and a great moment of catharsis for those sick of Treebeard droning on and on about trees.

In Frodo's quest, well, they're honestly not given a whole lot to do this movie.  They walk.  They walk some more.  The interesting stuff is done via Gollum, the tortured soul always at war with himself, and always in pursuit of the ring.  Gollum was the first CG character that people actually bought into and cared for.  He's eccentric, he's funny and he's compelling.  The hobbit gang does run into Faramir, and then we get a bit more background on the ""sons of Gondor"" but that aside, this isn't their movie.

To be honest, this film was always my least favorite of the trilogy, but that doesn't mean it isn't an incredible story.  Yeah, I think this one has the same flaws as the first, what with the incredibly long running time and some superfluous scenes, but that's to be expected.  What we're given in return is a fantasy rich with great characters, incredible locales and music, and some great action.  For those who like their epic battles, Helm's Deep is about as thrilling as it gets.

The Two Towers, like the other two Lord of the Rings films before and after it, has a hurdle you have to get over.  But if you're willing to go for it, it almost ceases to become a movie, and you feel yourself just getting transported into another world for a few hours.  For me, that's exactly what I look for in a fantasy epic, and the best compliment that it can receive."
"Jul 10, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Awesome film, with epic action, great story"
"Jul 10, 2011",NEUTRAL,"This movie was great. The action scenes were exciting and fast paced, and the actors brought tons more humor to this film than they did in the previous installment."
"Jul 9, 2011",NEUTRAL,Weakest of the bunch but still amazing!
"Jul 9, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Kind of slow with all of the wandering to be done, but just fine outside of that."
"Jul 8, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Excellent film, excellent rendition...just perfection. Well almost :P"
"Jul 8, 2011",NEUTRAL,Tolkein would be proud if he knew his books were good enough to allow their screen adaptations to break the golden 2 1/2 hour max rule and still be masterpieces
"Jul 7, 2011",NEUTRAL,Fell asleep again. Can't believe people ever enjoyed this movie.
"Jul 7, 2011",NEUTRAL,Best of all three if one had to be chosen.
"Jul 7, 2011",NEUTRAL,Insanely good. The Battle of Helm's Deep is so epic and grand in scale. The monologue that Sam gives at the end is amazing.
"Jul 6, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Legolas: A red sun rises, blood has been spilled this night. 

""The Battle for Middle-earth Begins!""
 
I was amazed by how much better this was then the first one with more intense action, better story, great characters still, and even better looking visuals. Definitely a must see for a great sequel improved in every way possible."
"Jul 6, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Everything about this film is epic. The characters, the battles, but especially the emotion. The emotion is what carries The Two Towers into ""iconic"" status."
"Jul 6, 2011",NEUTRAL,Most satisfying movie in the trilogy.
"Jul 4, 2011",NEUTRAL,"This is one of the best <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> film. My favourite scene is The Battle of Helm's Deep, what an amazing action-packed I ever seen. 
Viggo Mortensen is one of the best hero characters as Aragorn and brings an excellent performance with his amazing swordfights, flunts and horseracer in this fantasy film of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> series. Gollum shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. Bernard Hills's performance is truly first rate, as Theoden, King of Rohan, a performance which contributed greatly to ""The Battle of Helms Deep"", scenes which are a spinning tornado of emotions for the viewer. And this captures the deliriously beautiful New Zealand landscapes.
skilfully integrated extra footage makes this sequel much better than the cinema and previous DVD versions. Event without the hefty end credits, you get another 35 minutes of battle action and details on Aragorn, his elf girlfriend (Liv Tyler), new gal pal (Miranda Otto) and talkative Treebeard."
"Jul 4, 2011",NEUTRAL,As good as the first
"Jun 24, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The sequel to the first, The Two Towers definitely matches up with the first. After watching the first I was unbelievably excited to watch this.  Although they are very long films, it works, and I don't want them to end.  By the end of this, I wanted to pop in The Return Of The King right away. 

The Two Towers takes place right where the first ended.  Frodo and Sam are now alone, and begin their quest to Mount Doom.  Well Arogan, Legolas, and Gimli search for the pack of orcs that took Merry and Pippen.  Frodo and Sam also come across a the small creature Gollum who was following them in the first.  After they capture him, he agrees to guide them to Mordor, since they are lost, they have no choice but to trust him, and he is now part of the quest.  

I was extremely pleased at the greatness of this film.  It does not drop one bit from the first, and if anything it has gotten better.  

I personally love all the characters in the film, but if I had to pick one, it would have to be Legolas.

Gandalf also returns in the second as the ""white wizard"".  Don't worry, for those who haven't seen the film, it is not a spoiler.

The Two Towers is an extraordinary film, and proves that the first two are my favourite films of all time

My rating is
100%"
"Jun 23, 2011",NEUTRAL,Great expectations. Good film. Lousy follow-up. Unforgivable adaptation. You see the difficulty in assigning something so arbitrary as a few stars?
"Jun 23, 2011",NEUTRAL,"My favorite one. What can be said about this fantastic trilogy that hasn't been said already?. Spielberg said it was impposible to make. The battle at Helm's Deep is epic, hopless and..."
"Jun 23, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Man you guys have tot ry to be there for when they do Return of the King on the 28th @ 7:00. cause out of what i've experienced from seeing Fellowship and Two Towers on the big screen again, seeing Return of the King is going to be fantastic.

Plot: 1) Frodo and Sam have been separated from the rest of the fellowship and are now continuing to make their way into Mordor. But things take a turn as they run into the creature Gollum who is still trying to get the ring back.
2)Now that Borimir is gone, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimbli chase the Uruk-hai that have Marry and Pippin. But when they chase the hobbits all the way into Fangorn Forest, they meet an unlikely friend who takes them into a new quest: to save the country of Rohan.
3)Pippin and Merry went into Fangorn after the Uruk-hai that took them was attacked by Rohirrim. There they meet Treebeard and come across the gathering of Ents concerning what to do with Saruman.

After thinking about this movie when I saw it on the big screen the other night when one of my best friends asked me which movie was by favorite, I began to reconsider as to which one is my favorite between Two Towers and Return fo the King. I mean sure, who cares since I love them all and the trilogy has always been my favorite and unless my Lord commands or guides me otherwise, it always will be. But what makes this movie in a sense, stand out from the rest is how is...describes or develops more. It gets more into some of the characters such as Gollum, it gets more into the war, but more importantly, it gets more into the darkness and how there seems to be no hope at all for anyone. This is mostly done concerning Rohan. With the music and the things Saruman and his forces do to Rohan, how much they go though, It's just so powerful. They played that so well long before Helm's Depp-the most enduring battle scene in the history of cinema in my opinion-that in some ways, it's a slight wonder how it didn't win best picture over Chicago (besides the fact that Chicago is good) bad enough that Fellowship lost to Beautiful Mind (I have not seen it but from what my brother says who is a rather skeptical guy, Beautiful Mind had no place in the nominations compared to Fellowship) So much was done to prepare for the finale, and it was perfectly done.

Actors/Characters:
Elijah Wood/Frodo Baggins:Still did an Excellent job as Frodo.
Sean Astin/Samwise ""sam"" Gamgee: Same as Frodo. But I especially liked his monologue at the end. that was well done.
Ian McKellen/Gandalf the White: He still did good if nto made the character slightly more intersting now that he's come more mystical and powerful.
Viggo Mortensen/Aragorn:Man he's just so much more bad-a in this movie. You just have to love Aragorn.
Orlando Bloom/Legolas: What the heck was that? sliding down the stairs using an Uruk=hai shield while shooting down more Uruk-hai? The way he got on that horse during the fight with the Wargs and their riders? THAT'S JUST SO FREAKING AWESOME!!!!! Legolas is more and more lovable every time we see him.
John Rhys-Davies/ Gimbli and Treebeard: He is just as funny is not more funny in this film. plus he's using a bigger ax so what can you do without leaving out that? And I love Treebeard. I'd love to know what J.R.R. Tolkien would've thought about it. 
Billy Boyd and Domonic Monaghan/ Perregrin ""Pippin"" Took and Merriadoc ""Merry"" Brandybuck: Still lovable but they are getting better dramatic moments. 
Andy Serkis/Gollum and Smeagol:Wow. Just...wow. I mean Gollum was a unique character enough just out of the books but boy did Serkis show that just as much with this film. He did an amazing job. 
Christopher Lee/Saruman:Thsi was his big moment since this primarily focused on Saruman and his plan to destroy Rohan. and he did it perfectly.
Bernard Hill/King Theodin: He was in interesting character concerning how he was so focused in saving Rohan even when he was making rather stubborn choices which weren't that bad. I mean we got some wonderful battle scenes out of it.
Mirando Otto/Eowyn: She played a very interesting character it's a shame that she wasn't developed this much in the books. I mean she was shown a bit of this during her time with Faramir during Return of the King but that's sort of it. 
David Wenham/Farimir: You really have to love Farimir. I mean what really does it is his back story. This is another perfect example of why the extended edition is better. Because you see more of his back story. I mean you find out already with what happens in the next film but the extra scene with that flashback, That helped better. 

Music: excellent. my favorite music was the main Rohan song which really helped with showing what they were going through. ""Gollum's Song"" was very good too. 

Effects: Awesome.

Make-up: I forgot to say from the first film but they did a remarkable job on this especially with the orcs.

Editing: excellent as as usual.

And that is my review for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. only one more to go and I'll have reviewed them all and and written a total of 100 reviews. see you guys then."
"Jun 23, 2011",NEUTRAL,Watching the battle of Helm's Deep on the big screen again reminds me of the magic of the theater. The audience surrounding me cheers when Gandalf reappears. They clap as the orcs run into Fangorn and are destroyed by the trees. They explode as the film comes to an end and we all rejoice knowing we will gather next week for the final film. If you ever get the chance to watch the film again in the theater don't miss it.  This was the way they were designed to be seen. Long live the elves!
"Jun 23, 2011",NEUTRAL,My fave of the three films.  Cor  go Viggo
"Jun 22, 2011",NEUTRAL,All the movies a pretty much the same special effect which are pretty amazing
"Jun 22, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The task is underway, the fellowship is broken and open war is on the verge of tearing the kingdoms of Rohan and Gondor apart. These are the obstacles that the heroes in the LOTR trilogy must overcome as the fight for Middle Earth begins. Darker and more action packed than its predecessor, the Two Towers was challenged with trying to create its own story while still bridging the gap between the first and third movie. It succeeds at this thanks to the wonderful chemistry between the actors, a rousing score and one of the greatest battle scenes of this generation."
"Jun 22, 2011",NEUTRAL,"this movie is even better than the the 1st part. i can't believe this movie got ONLY 96%. this movie didn't deserve anything less than 100%. peter Jackson is a great filmmaker. loved every bit of this movie. LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY and INCEPTION are the greatest movies i have ever seen. the story was really epic, the visual effects stunning, the movie simply outstanding"
"Jun 22, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Another awesome movie!  Still a bit long, but very good.  I saw the extended edition today in theaters and it took a 3 hour movie and made it 3h 40m long.  Definitely still worth seeing and owning. =)"
"Jun 22, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers not only stands as my favorite chapter in the LOTR trilogy, it succeeds in being one of the greatest sequels of all time. This fantasy film is full of delight and magic to please viewers from generation to generation."
"Jun 21, 2011",NEUTRAL,"After seeing the (extended version of the) second installment of The Lord of the Rings trilogy in a theater packed full of Lord of the Rings fans, I'm pretty confident that the third installment will not disappoint."
"Jun 21, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Sequels are normally no more than acceptable in quality, but this one is actually quite exceptional. Everything that made the first film good is back, possibly even better, but once again it is the musical score of Howard Shore that steals the show."
"Jun 21, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Lets talk about The Two Towers. Well, it seems a lot shorter to me than the last one so that's better. It centers around The fellowship (which has been separated in this movie into 3 groups) and their quest to combat Sauron. The theme of this film (I believe) is centered around addiction. True this theme was in the previous and probably next film, but it is set up more clearly here. Frodo is has slowly begun to fall into temptation, and he already seems to have grown attached to the (precious) ring. I think the addiction theme is played out quite well. Hence, Gollum, the victim of the ring, who is the embodiment of addiction itself...that and split-personality disorder. So what do I have to say about Gollum? He's great. The portrayal, character, special effect, it's all great. He was done in a realistic manner, in which you start to believe he is front of the camera. I believe the directors knew this, because when the film cuts away from him and Frodo, they stay away for a long time. They new everyone liked him, and they ended up keeping this critic glued in his seat waiting for his return. Now the battle sequence was frightening, revealing with great detail the fear of war, and how it affects people. I do question though, how Aragorn (Mortensen), Gimli (Davies), and Legolas (Bloom) survive being thrown into a pit of orcs...oh right, the plot says so. One thing I didn't really like was the Ring Wraiths riding dragons, they don't really seem as creepy as they did on horses, but hey, maybe they needed an upgrade. Well I have one more, and then I will have FINALLY seen The Lord of the Rings trilogy. I give this film 5 rings out of 5 (PRECIOUS!) rings."
"Jun 21, 2011",NEUTRAL,"My favorite movie of the trilogy.  Great cast, acting, story, cinematography, characters, and direction."
"Jun 21, 2011",NEUTRAL,The movie was perfect the acting of the stars as well as the story line was magestic. This time around the movie carefully followed and depicted the events which occured in the book. There was no fault which I could personally find and I am delighted with the vision of Peter Jackson. Everyone should watch the movie as well as it predecessor and successor.
"Jun 19, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Probably the most action oriented part of the story, but just as good as the others nonetheless. The Two Towers is a gritty adaptation of the book which was much different, the chapter depicting the battle at helms deep was about ten pages while it took up about an hour in the film. So what makes it great?
 It is probably the greatest action movie of all time, because it does not rely entirely on action. This film went deeply into the magic of the world, trekking through marshes, going deeply into Fangorn Forest, and ultimately preparing for the final battle. The action sequences, as always, are superb, the visual effects are mind blowing, and I think that what ultimately makes this movie is the adventure. It is impossible to look away, you cannot even get up to go to the restroom, I was completely captivated the entire time. While the theatrical release may have been much different, the extended edition( which I believe was the film that Jackson wanted to make"" is much truer to the book, so if you want to bitch and moan about how much different the theatrical film is from the book, the extended film is probably for you. I think that the Two Towers is ultimately about the struggle, not with just the hobbits, but all of the characters, they are all battling their own demons. Jackson's films still remain the greatest fantasy films ever made, Sorry folks, but Harry Potter isn't a fantasy, it is a fairy tale. What most don't realize is that every fantasy written after this one, copies it in some way or another. This is the purest form of the genre, if you do not like this story, then you do not like fantasy."
"Jun 19, 2011",NEUTRAL,Again the same thing over and over again
"Jun 19, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Not as good as the first, but still epic."
"Jun 18, 2011",NEUTRAL,Tied with number 3! Amazing movie overall!
"Jun 18, 2011",NEUTRAL,the best out of the trilogy! the final battle is indiscriminate it just has to be witnessed
"Jun 18, 2011",NEUTRAL,"This film managers to hold it's own and continue the trilogy perfectly. It's a great step and really shows how much thought Peter Jackson and his crew put into the whole trilogy. It's a great set up for the Return of the King, so it does it's job perfectly that way."
"Jun 17, 2011",NEUTRAL,"No not as good as star wars, but I like em all"
"Jun 17, 2011",NEUTRAL,"An amazing sequel that has a very different feel to first due to how The Fellowship Of The Ring ended with all the main cast split in groups and we have 3 separate stories all connected but all have a different journey, All the cast are great yet again with more added this time, Humour was taken out and replaced with suspense as it builds to one of the greatest on screen battles ever that still leaves me with goosebumps today, My only concern was they made the actual Ring journey take a backseat to the battle scenes too much, But apart from that sit back and enjoy part 2 what will one day go down as another classic trilogy."
"Jun 15, 2011",NEUTRAL,Trees talk and fight wars.  Why do people like this series??
"Jun 14, 2011",NEUTRAL,"THE TWO TOWERS is truly the best LORD OF THE RINGS film, and it really should have won the Oscar for Best Picture, if any in the epic trilogy.  This one is the most interesting, and it doesn't carry on forever at all."
"Jun 14, 2011",NEUTRAL,Loved this more than the last film
"Jun 13, 2011",NEUTRAL,Probably the best one!!
"Jun 13, 2011",NEUTRAL,Love the Battle at Helm's Deep!
"Jun 13, 2011",NEUTRAL,Excellent fantasy adventure film.
"Jun 13, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Even more of a thriller than it's predescessor, ""The Two Towers"" conveys the world of Tolkien's imagination through very mystical dialogue and impressive performances. 
Pure poetry."
"Jun 12, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings keeps on rolling, and is still as exciting and fantastic. The Two Towers continues the epic story with new characters, more drama and one hell of a climactic battle.

Frodo and Sam continue their dangerous journey towards Mordor, but unexpectedly encounter Gollum, a creature who is tormented and obsessed by the Ring. Meanwhile the trio of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli follow their own adventures of finding an old friend, saving a king and defending a kingdom from doom from Saruman's large army. Like I said in The Fellowship of the Ring review, there's nothing like the beginning of the adventure. But The Two Towers is a followup that is just as memorable. All the characters have to face certain death, but they never turn back, even when situations seem hopeless and there can't possibly be no good outcome. It's that kind of hope and will that really fires you up and raises your spirits. But we get to see more character driven drama, like Frodo's pitty for Gollum because of what the Ring has done to him mind. We see a king's will to act like a king to save his people, and Aragorn's fight for his kind, even though we know his love has left Middle Earth. And we get to see Boromir's brother. The passionate themes of The Lord of the Rings are incredible, and The Two Towers is a great sequel, carrying the same passion, adventure, and humour. (The body count game between Gimli and Legolas is just brilliant)

The look of The Two Towers is just as impressive as The Fellowship's. And Peter Jackson's directing is just as brilliant too. His filming, pacing of scenes and ability to balance action and drama is incredible and never falls flat for a second. It's Jackson's experience with the thriller genre that makes The Lord of the Rings movies so interesting. When the action heats up, you are always at the edge of your set in amazement of the detail and surprises. Like before, there is great amounts of detail in EVERYTHING. The costumes, sets, art direction, weapons, makeup, cinematography, everything has 100% effort and is absolutely stunning. But spacifically, I really love the battle of Helm's Deep. Helm's Deep has to be the best battle sequence in the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy. The cinematography and rainy setting looks wonderful and scary, the CGI is amazing, and the pacing of the battle is moving. You see hope, failure, some funny bits, struggle, and the loss of hope all tightly fitted into a long battle that will take your breath away when it is over. You also hear some new music scores for The Two Towers, which I personally like. It's very fitting and uplifting.

Some may call The Two Towers the weaker of the trilogy, but that's because the story isn't done yet. But The Two Towers in none the less as emotionally compelling tale that has everything that makes a good story, and the filmmaking is the best (and pretty damn detailed and complicated) you'll ever see. Peter Jackson makes The Two Towers an incredibly entertaining and wonderful movie as part of a brilliant trilogy.

Also note: the ""Special Extended Edition"" is the best version to get. You get more story and stuff. As a matter of fact, that goes for the other 2 movies as well. The Extended Editions are where it's at."
"Jun 12, 2011",NEUTRAL,sorry not a fan of this one.
"Jun 12, 2011",NEUTRAL,Very good movie. Enjoyed it. 9.0/10
"Jun 12, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Who would've thought that a great movie would be a huge letdown? That's exactly what I thought of The Two Towers. The first film, The Fellowship of the Ring, was one of my favorite films of all time. Each scene had a major reasoning for being there, and you can tell each scene had a lot of care and heart put towards it. This movie doesn't have that feel to it. Sure, it continues the story rather well, but as a sequel to one of the greatest films of all time, it falls flat. I guess my biggest flaw with it is doesn't take itself seriously as much as the first film. Gollum is not very likable or serious, the dialogue is not always intriguing, the action is unrealistic and not as brutal as you might expect, every actor looks as if they want all the cameras focused on them, and the first couple minutes are more epic then the rest of the film, even though it's a flashback. Now, I know what you're thinking: ""Why'd you give the film 3 1/2 stars even though you have so much complaints to it""? Well, because it's an enjoyable adventure. It's flawed, but it has heart. The acting isn't the best, but they get the job done. It may not be as good as the first, but it's a great movie in it's own right. There's so many bad things, yet there's plenty of good things to even out the score. It's just a flawed, but still great film. Now, for the best thing, well, besides the story, and that would be the special effects, which were even better than the first film, and you feel as if you were transported to middle-earth itself. The only bad thing about the special effects is they upstage everything else, but luckily the effects are subtle, so it doesn't upstage the story. If you liked the first film, I really have no idea what you'll think of this. I thought it was pretty good, but other people thought it was a masterpiece. I guess I'll recommend it if you liked the first, but don't be surprised if it's not as good."
"Jun 10, 2011",NEUTRAL,A rare sequel that matches the quality of the first..
"Jun 10, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Watching this again. I seem to always be a fan of the second part of trilogies when it seems hopeless. Like Sam says: when it seems it's darkest and it seems they are going to give up hope, they choose to go on."
"Jun 10, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Excellent. Such an epic, entertaining film. Can't wait to see the last installment."
"Jun 5, 2011",NEUTRAL,Cooool!!!!! Gallum or Smittle is up to no good! Sam is right
"Jun 5, 2011",NEUTRAL,"As with the books, Sam & Frodo are the weakest part of this story.

Amazing adaptation of a great work of fiction."
"May 25, 2011",NEUTRAL,That was a looong walk.
"May 24, 2011",NEUTRAL,In action better than first.
"May 23, 2011",NEUTRAL,"COPY HERE WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE FIRST PART.

The extra is a little critic in the field of plot changing. It did bother me at first, but is nothing that can't be forgiven."
"May 21, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Really good if you have the extended edition.  Those are always the best.  Kind of small compared to Fellowship and Return, but still a great movie."
"May 21, 2011",NEUTRAL,Everything was perfect. Best movie ever for me.
"May 20, 2011",NEUTRAL,One of the best medieval fantasy ever!!!!!
"May 19, 2011",NEUTRAL,This film is a masterpiece!
"May 18, 2011",NEUTRAL,"My least favorite of the three, but still great"
"May 17, 2011",NEUTRAL,I'm a dork and here are 5 stars to prove it.
"May 16, 2011",NEUTRAL,"In The Two Towers, Peter Jackson continues his majestic adaptation of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, and I adore this film for its brilliant and beautiful depictions of the novel's two major battles: the sacking of Orthanc (Saruman's fortress) and the Battle of Helm's Deep between the forces of Saruman and the Rohirrim under the command of King Theoden and Aragorn.  Like its predecessor in the film series, The Two Towers deviates from the novel, bit I applaud its embellishments because it actually depicts moments such as the Ents attacking Orthanc instead of just glossing over them.  A powerful, emotional, and genuinely epic entry in one of the great fantasy film series of all time."
"May 16, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Though my least favorite of the Lord of the Rings, that's not saying much as this is one of my favorite film franchises."
"May 16, 2011",NEUTRAL,The best in the trilogy
"May 16, 2011",NEUTRAL,still can't decide which one of the trilogy is my favorite. but probably this. maybe not though.
"May 14, 2011",NEUTRAL,I think that this one is the best out of the three.
"May 14, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Even better than the first one. Epic characters, epic setting, and an epic plot. Timeless, beautiful but in a dark way."
"May 14, 2011",NEUTRAL,Up there with Star Wars as one of my favorite trilogies.
"May 12, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Liked it.

Considering how much I enjoyed the books and first movie this one was highly disappointing to me. The entire side story of the Ents was just painfully slow and agonizingly boring to watch, so much so that it made me fall asleep in the theater! I can honestly say that is something no other movie, in the theater, has ever managed to do to me.

I own the entire trilogy now so I've seen it all the way through since and while I can watch without nodding off now, I'm still just not overly impressed with this film. Golem's side story and trekking closer and closer to the tower made me really engaged.

Overall I'd say I liked it but it was definitely a step back for me."
"May 10, 2011",NEUTRAL,Helm's Deep is the best battle of the trilogy.
"May 10, 2011",NEUTRAL,Its LOTR.. What more should i say..
"May 9, 2011",NEUTRAL,"This film is like a blur to me in my memory, but I always think it was better than the first. The battle of helmsdeep is the best part. More than makes up for any lack in the rest of the film anyway."
"May 9, 2011",NEUTRAL,A truly classical fantasy
"May 9, 2011",NEUTRAL,I don't know why Two Towers never get's recognition... Helm's Deep? Rohan? Gollum? This is the most exciting chapter.
"May 9, 2011",NEUTRAL,best battle scene ever. mmm pg-13 at least
"May 8, 2011",NEUTRAL,"I know that trees walked, otherwise very forgettable"
"May 8, 2011",NEUTRAL,Never saw this kind of cinema before
"May 7, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Weaker than the first, but only just. More great acting from Sir Ian and great direction from Peter Jackson."
"May 7, 2011",NEUTRAL,"great movie, hooks you on"
"May 6, 2011",NEUTRAL,Its an amazing adaptation of the book with action and stunning visuals.
"May 6, 2011",NEUTRAL,second best in LOTR series
"May 6, 2011",NEUTRAL,An excellent screenplay adaptation of the novel.
"May 5, 2011",NEUTRAL,really really enjoyed it
"May 3, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Alongside Return of The King & Fellowship, the greatest achievement in film ever, bar none."
"May 3, 2011",NEUTRAL,"and I still love the extended version!
 one of those epics, which modern film needs.perhaps many people would dislike this, but it succeeds where Tolkien could not. Plus, the Peter Jackson remake is free from Tolkien`s racism of his time."
"May 3, 2011",NEUTRAL,"EXTENDED EDITION REVIEW

A great second second film that truly shines in its extended form.

Again Boromir Fans, you will love this edition."
"May 3, 2011",NEUTRAL,"This is the weakest part of the 3, but it's still good."
"May 2, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The one that didn't need to be made. A waste of three hours of my life, I can't stand these films!"
"May 1, 2011",NEUTRAL,my favorite of all three
"Apr 29, 2011",NEUTRAL,Genial! La escena de la batalla en el abismo de Elm es la mejor parte de la película
"Apr 26, 2011",NEUTRAL,An absolute triumph in breathtaking cinematography and beautiful action choreography! One of the best sequels in cinema history.
"Apr 25, 2011",NEUTRAL,The best movie trilogy of all time
"Mar 28, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Lacks the emotional resonance of the first, but still a great adventure."
"Mar 26, 2011",NEUTRAL,LOTR Trilogy changed how movies are made today.
"Mar 26, 2011",NEUTRAL,The next installment in the series takes the action up a notch with some of the most epic battle scenes in any movie.
"Mar 25, 2011",NEUTRAL,"my least favorite of the trilogy, still awesome."
"Mar 24, 2011",NEUTRAL,only saw half? jejeje
"Mar 24, 2011",NEUTRAL,Probably the best sequel of the decade (2000-2010)
"Mar 21, 2011",NEUTRAL,My favorite so far lol.
"Mar 21, 2011",NEUTRAL,""" The fate of the world will now be decided. """
"Mar 20, 2011",NEUTRAL,"the reason why i think this is the best of the three is pacing. when the battle at helm's deep starts, you know its going to be a doozy and when it ends, there's a crisp 5 minutes of foreshadowing before the credits."
"Mar 19, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The best of the series, especially if you see the extended version.  The acting of Bernard Hill and Miranda Otto was great in this film."
"Mar 19, 2011",NEUTRAL,Favorite one in the trilogy.
"Mar 17, 2011",NEUTRAL,"After re-watching this film again, I just can't get over how much I love it! It brings back memories of high school and me nerding out all the time about it. I won't say that this is my favorite of the trilogy because to tell you the truth I can't choose a favorite. I believe that if you watch the first, then you need to watch the second and third. (Not necessarily back-to-back but as close to each other as you possibly can). Anyways this film is amazing. The battle scenes, the thoughtful scenes. Peter Jackson definitely adapted the film in the best way possible from the book."
"Mar 17, 2011",NEUTRAL,The whole trilogy is my favorite movie of all time
"Mar 16, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The extended edition of this flick is worth seeing, along with every other extended edition. But this one was my favorite."
"Mar 14, 2011",NEUTRAL,"These movies get better and better. The elf scenes were boring, but eveything else was awesome."
"Mar 13, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Not as good as the first but probably the best sequel i have ever seen, Peter Jackson pullls it off again with more violence in great fasion. Quiet possibly one of the best battles to ever make it to the big screen Helms Deep."
"Mar 12, 2011",NEUTRAL,More emotional than the first film and perhaps better overall. I consider this the best in the trilogy.
"Mar 12, 2011",NEUTRAL,A must watch ... GREAT !!
"Mar 11, 2011",NEUTRAL,2nd best out of the trilogy
"Mar 11, 2011",NEUTRAL,"I have tried reviewing this from an objective view point a thousand times and I just can't. Despite its flaws - of which I think there are few - I adore the whole trilogy. Peter Jackson has taken an epic story and translated it on screen to create a masterpiece. He has managed to give the novels a new lease of life and offer it to a new generation of film-goers and readers.

The source material for the second instalment is inundated with many additional plot lines which offer relief from Frodo (Wood) and Sam's (Astin) journey to Mordor. New characters manage to keep the viewing fresh while remembering old favourites from The Fellowship and continuing to move the story along.

Probably one of the largest pulls to the trilogy is the presence of highly regarded actors such as Ian McKellen, Andy Serkis and Viggo Mortensen.  Every member of the cast has a firm grasp on the mannerisms and part their character has to play within the story which comes across with a strong sense of gratification.

The scene where Gandalf (McKellen) arrives at the battle with the riders of Rohan and the sun rises behind him defines a truly perfect film experience for me. The sheer magnitude makes you shiver and marks a triumph for the people losing hope at Helm's Deep. The battle scenes that Jackson has constructed are marvellous and full of raw emotion and intensity rather than being bloodbath scenes with no meaning.

Jackson's direction has been consistently good from The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers is no exception. Stylistically, he has perfected the balance between the beauty of Middle-earth and the brutality of the war of the ring. Technically the trilogy has been a definite pinnacle of modern cinema and is certainly a landmark of the fantasy genre.

Being the only film I have so far given a 5 star rating, The Two Towers is a favourite and will more than likely remain so for a long time."
"Feb 10, 2011",NEUTRAL,Fantastic movie adaptation of the novels.
"Feb 10, 2011",NEUTRAL,Best of the trilogy. The Helm's Deep battle was the most graphically amazing of all the movies.
"Feb 10, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Continues the high standard of the first instalment, with excellent characterisation of Gollum, Treebeard and the Ents, and of course the Uruk-hai. The battle at Helms Deep is long, dark and poignant, and the night cinematography is amazing!"
"Feb 8, 2011",NEUTRAL,The alpha and omega of modern fantasy film- part 2.
"Feb 8, 2011",NEUTRAL,who the fuck cares about this shit..
"Feb 7, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Slow, plodding and frankly at times dull and effortless"
"Feb 7, 2011",NEUTRAL,"My least favorite, but it is still LOTR so I cannot rate it any less. The end is the best and the Ents make it worthwhile. Solid performances, as always."

"Jan 27, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Not as good as film one, but still good the battle for helms deep is great."
"Jan 26, 2011",NEUTRAL,This movie is an instant classic fantasy movie.
"Jan 25, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Curiosamente he escuchado comentarios que la segunda cinta es la menos popular de las tres. En mi caso, es dificil separar una cinta de las otras 2, ya que juntas realmente es como se cuenta toda la historia. Pero hablando de la segunda, la disfrutÃ (C) mucho ya que es cuando uno de mis personajes favoritos de la saga que es Eowyn. Evidentemente Arwen es hermosa y es una princesa elfa, pero Eowyn es una gran personaje que logra posicionarse tanto como mujer asÃ­ como guerrera. Gimli tambiÃ (C)n tiene excelentes escenas que es otro de mis personajes favoritos. Y ciertamente mi escena favorita es cuando el escuadrÃ³n de elfos entra a HelmÂ´s Deep ya que es un momento donde todo se siente perdido y la llegada de ese refuerzo a la batalla levanta los Ã¡nimos de la gente. En esta ocasiÃ³n, las escenas extendidas aportan mucho, en varias partes de la cintas, por lo cual si no han visto la versiÃ³n extendida, recomiendo mucho que lo hagan, su experiencia de la historia cambiarÃ¡, incluso adiciona informaciÃ³n sobre Aragorn que no se menciona antes, el oir cantar a Eowyn es invaluable y reaparece un gran personaje que se hubiera pensado que no vuelve a aparecer, y no, no hablo de Gandalf, sino de una escena flashback donde reaparece uno de los grandes personajes de la primera entrega."

And the battle for the Helm's Deep makes me excited every time I watch it, also after 8 years from the release of the film and, probably, not less than 5 or 6 visions. ""Sometime the middle part of trilogies are the weakest, but that's not the case"" wrote someone before me. I can only add: in this trilogy the second part is the strongest!"

"Jan 1, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers.
Character driven, but fantastically epic.
PJ pulls it off again. Of course no film in the trilogy is complete without the others, but they work so powerfully as stand-alone films as well. As in the other two, the attention to detail is incredible, I mean truly incredible. Middle Earth is real guys, Peter Jackson flawlessly took the image he (and a lot of others) envisioned and captured it.
The biggest hiccup are the deviations from Tolkien (there were more in this film than the other two), such as the Warg fight and the trip to Osgiliath. I suppose for those who haven't read the book, everything flows and correlates, but these were pretty upsetting if you're a Tolkien fan.
The movie's greatest success? Well, its successes were the elements, story points, and characters inspired (or even directly copied) from the book. Yes, much of the film I spend (not spent, this one deserves an annual viewing) holding my jaw open staring at the eye popping visuals, however, that's not reaaaally what it's about. It's about Frodo, and Sam, and it's obvious. Such tremendous effort is put into character development, each of them falter, and each is given a chance to redeem themselves (primary credit to Tolkien, but partial credit to all those involved in the filmmaking process).
The Two Towers in particular pushes the trilogy forward with the new character Gollum. Andy Serkis invested so much into this entirely animated loon, and it shows. A little example, every time I (and you too, be honest) watch the schizophrenic fight between Gollum and Smeagol, I'm compelled.

Why 100%?
Well, despite the deviations from the book, it does it's source material justice. And honestly, I think of The Two Towers merely as the second chapter of one story, The Lord of the Rings, as it is but one story, as a whole, it is perfect. The story of Frodo and Sam alone would be an incredible one, but add compelling three-dimensional supporting cast, an array of battles and adventures, and overall stunning visuals, and you have a masterpiece.

Extra: Helpful in defining the word ""Epic!"" I find this movie to be wonderfully quotable, ""Ten thousand strong"" probably being the most popular. I love how almost everyone agrees that the Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli storyline is the best one, followed by Frodo/Sam, and then trailing at the back is Merry/Pippin, who spend most of the movie sitting in a tree."

"Dec 30, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Plot/Summary
Set in a time of uncertainty in the land of Middle-earth, a tale which charts a heroic quest, which centers around an intrepid hobbit. The future of civilization rests in the fate of the One Ring, which has been lost for centuries. Powerful forces are unrelenting in their search for it. But fate has placed it in the hands of a young Hobbit named Frodo Baggins, who inherits the Ring and steps into legend. A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the Ringbearer as his assigned duty is to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged. But he can't accomplish this task alone. A Fellowship bands together to lend Frodo all that he needs to carry out his mission: the wisdom of Gandalf; the loyalty of his friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin; the courage of Aragorn and Boromir; the precision of Legolas; and the strength of Gimli. They are aided in their quest by Arwen, Galadriel and Elrond, whose knowledge of the Ring brings to light the true danger and importance of their journey.
My Review
Fans of director Peter Jackson's big screen adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring have been eagerly anticipating The Two Towers - its action-intensive follow-up - for a year. But even viewers in love with the first installment in this theatrical trilogy found it difficult not to ask a few very fair, very basic questions. Chief among them: ""Can Jackson do it again, or will the whole shebang ultimately collapse under its own weight and excess, like so many other films of this nature have in the past?""

They need worry no longer: The Two Towers is an accomplishment equal to its predecessor, but it succeeds in very different arenas. Where Fellowship shocked viewers with its unrelenting focus on character development and dramatic truth, such qualities are sidelined here in favor of propulsion and sheer grandeur. With a two-hour and fifty-something minute running time, TTT is remarkably well paced, and is so texturally dense that several viewings may required just to take it all in. Those who felt the first film meandered a bit will find The Two Towers much more tightly focused and hard-driving. Those who felt Fellowship's greatest triumph lay in its depth and characterization may find TTT a bit remote - more distancing, and not as uninvolving.

But such deficits are counterbalanced by the sheer audacity of the spectacle before us. Rarely (if ever) in the history of cinema have sequences of such magnitude been brought to the screen: tens-of-thousands of soldier-creatures storm an imposing fortress called Helm's Deep, where human refugees are holding out in fight for survival and freedom - a fanciful riff on the legendary Alamo. Armies of talking tree creatures tear into villain Saruman's lair, exacting primal revenge against those who have abused their brethren. Orcs ride herds of horsy-sized helldogs into battle against our heroes. The list goes on - this thing is big.

Visual effects by WETA are generally top-notch, although observant viewers may catch a few pesky weaknesses suggesting the film's VFX team may have, simply, just run out of time. ""Halo-ing"" around character's hairlines (a little bit of green screen spill that makes for a sloppy composite) runs rampant here. ""Animated"" objects (such as the Ents - the walking, talking ""tree creatures"" mentioned above) sometimes look inorganic with their surroundings and backgrounds (the different ""layers"" of the effect are obvious), and even basic compositing sometimes makes characters seem ""cut out"", or ""flat"" against a background of different texture or depth. But for every shortcoming, there is a triumph. And, despite the giddy vastness of the sequences mentioned above, the greatest accomplishment of all is a guy named Gollum.



(l-r) Saruman (Christopher Lee) and Wormtongue (Brad Dourif): mobilizing their army towards Helm's Deep, in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.
Interestingly enough, Gollum himself is imperfect: his digital nature is often betrayed by his choppy, squirrelly movements in long shots. But when we see his face, up-close, his is instantly believable, and thoroughly sympathetic and compelling. Taunted by a seemingly unceasing internal-conflict (he is constantly revealing his duality via a verbalized - and decidedly psychotic - inner monologue), Gollum gets more character development than anyone else in The Two Towers, and quickly puts Star Wars ""writer""/""director"" George Lucas' Jar Jar Binks to shame. Looking like an Ethiopian Steve Buscemi, Gollum may well be the first digital creature put on-screen who completely sells himself (itself?) as a character and personality worthy of inclusion in a ""real world.""
There's not much to say about the returning cast - they are all pretty-much what they were established to be in The Fellowship of the Ring, and rarely move beyond that. Newcomers include Bernard Hill (Captain of James Cameron's Titanic) as Theoden, ruler of a kingdom besieged by the forces of darkness; genre freakazoid Brad Dourif as the duplicitous Grima Wormtongue; Miranda Otto as Eowyn, who spends much of her time acting tough and pining for Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn; David Wenham as Faramir (brother of Sean Bean's Boromir, who checked-out in the first film. Although Wenham looks like...and pretty much acts like...Sean Bean, so I'm at a bit of a loss here); and Andy Serkis as the live-action motion template (and voice) of Gollum (both appeared briefly in Fellowship, but Gollum is a full-fledged character here).

Viewers who find the The Two Towers spiritually unengaging can take heart. In a recent interview with IGN FilmForce, Peter Jackson reveals that The Return of the King - the trilogy's final installment - is his favorite film, describing it as ""incredibly emotional."" Despite the more cursory nature of TTT, it's beginning to look like oddball Jackson may have accomplished the unimaginable, and knocked one of history's most challenging literature-to-film adaptations clean out of the park.

No matter what one ultimate feels about The Two Towers, one consideration shines brightly above the rest: it will show you things you've never seen before. And, in this day and age, that's not an accomplishment to be taken lightly.<div style=""width:800px;""><a href=""http://www.flixster.com/photos/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-two-towers-the-lord-of-the-rings---the-two-towers-5113933""><img src=""http://content7.flixster.com/photo/51/13/93/5113933_gal.jpg"" border=""0""/></a><div style=""text-align:center;font-size:10px;""><a href=""http://www.flixster.com"">Flixster</a> - Share Movies</div></div>"

"Dec 29, 2010",NEUTRAL,The LOTR trilogy is a gem.
"Dec 29, 2010",NEUTRAL,"I lied, this is the best of the LOTR trilogy."
"Dec 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,The lesser movie of the trilogy is still a fun ride nevertheless and showcases Andy Serkis as Gollum who invents the new CGI model of the 2000's.
"Dec 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,I think this is my favorite of the three.
"Dec 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,one of my fave films :)
"Dec 26, 2010",NEUTRAL,"An exhilarating tale is continued, and Jackson does well at continuing Fellowship's beautiful look and feel into The Two Towers  while still giving this installment its own identity."
"Dec 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,Loved it. It's a movie that I can enjoy with a nerdy fantasy
"Dec 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,My personal fave in the series
"Dec 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Fleshier than its previous film, Two Towers rises above its predecessor through effective narrative techniques, riveting battle sequences, masterful scores from Howard Shore, and beautiful dialogue from all characters. This truly is a story ""that really matters."""
"Dec 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,I have watched this movie from part one until the last part and it was so good..
"Dec 13, 2010",NEUTRAL,Better than the first. Utter masterpiece.
"Dec 12, 2010",NEUTRAL,A masterpiece beyond imagination
"Dec 12, 2010",NEUTRAL,"""Mr. Frodo!"" ""Oh Sam!"""
"Dec 12, 2010",NEUTRAL,GREAT SEQUAL TO THE TRILOGY!!! PETER JACKSON YOU DONE IT AGAIN!
"Dec 11, 2010",NEUTRAL,Not the best but good enough. Gollum was great.
"Dec 11, 2010",NEUTRAL,"This somehow did not work for me. If this was supposed to be serious, it was verging on the ridiculous. I could excuse the first one for a little low-brow humour considering it didnâ(TM)t get right into the journey at first, but it was too overdone to at least lighten the mood in a serious context. It also had massive pacing issues, as it either brought everything to a standstill or hurried everything on, and itâ(TM)s suddenly strange how they stray off and bring to your attention scenes of no point whatsoever.
On the positive side, the acting wasnâ(TM)t affected too much. The scenes with either Legolas, Aragorn or Frodo were beautifully done, so I have come to terms with the fact that the acting can still be good even when the pacing isnâ(TM)t. Despite that, they should have taken a few of the characters out, because they were kind of pointless. I liked Gollum (or SmÃ (C)agol), but I think he was just there for the crazy factor. Overall, it was good, but was not as good as the first one. This could definitely have been better. Maybe they should just have done two films if there was going to be such a big gap in the middle."
"Dec 10, 2010",NEUTRAL,"excellent movie by peter jackson...
gollum character is amazing in dis movie..
excellent production designing..."
"Dec 9, 2010",NEUTRAL,Plainly splendid. Amazing job
"Dec 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The much darker second installment of the epic motion picture trilogy. Two Towers ticks all the criteria for an excellent sequel: with a host of new and interesting characters, stunning new locations and cultures and some awesomely orgasmic battle scenes as well."
"Dec 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Although far more focused on Aragorn and the travels of others besides the ring, this movie is wonderful. The climactic battle of Helms Deep could be one of the greatest scenes in movie history."
"Dec 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,"(Extended Edition Blu-ray Review): What a ""precious"" sequel this is! It does what a middle film in a trilogy should do. It resumes where Fellowship ended and sets up the grand finale that is Return of the King. Again, the extended edition is heads and shoulders above the theatrical one."
"Dec 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,I need a 6th star for this one!!!
"Dec 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Loved it, loved it, Loved it"
"Dec 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,Extended edition is even better.  Time to buy a projector to go with the full surround sound experience.
"Dec 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,Okay.  Whatever.  Hobbits.
"Dec 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,Gollum is such a beloved character. My precious!
"Dec 1, 2010",NEUTRAL,sooo good but so long.
"Nov 29, 2010",NEUTRAL,"This whole movie is a prelude to a battle, and the battle itself takes way too long to come to an end. However, it's still very entertaining, highly atmospheric, and drives relentlessly downward into the darker abysses of Tolkien's epic. Bernard Hill's King Théoden is an amazingly-acted, surprisingly deep supporting character who adds much to this installment."
"Nov 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Even though it has a bad story, this is the second movie in the series, and the whole point of it is to continue the story and prepare for the final movie.  Even though I was disappointed with the movie, because the second book is the best in the series, I still thought it was entertaining when Frodo has to tame Smeagol.  The special effects are phenomenal when they retreat to Helm's Deep, and besides a few mess-ups with the story, it is equal to the first and third film in the series"
"Nov 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,"solid in effort, so so in execution, including many poorly made forced attempts at slapstick humor"
"Nov 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,How could you top the effects and story of Fellowhip of the Rings?  Two Towers starts with a fiery descent through middle earth with Gandalf battling the Belroc.  Amazing opening!  The ringwraiths have traded their bloody steeds for flying dragons. The Orc army poised to wipe out the last of man.  The trees fighting back and toppling Sarumans tower.  Gollum/Smeagal takes center stage and is one the most convincing CGI characters in film at this point.  Highly recommended.
"Nov 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,loved it! Couldn't wait for the next movie.  Now waiting to see the Hobbit.
"Nov 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,ang haba nito.... xet
"Nov 26, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Charged with advancing a colossal story on multiple fronts, Peter Jackson's second installment in the storied trilogy sags a bit under the weight of its responsibilities and ends up coming down with a mild case of middle-chapter-itis. That's not to say it doesn't get the job done. The film does a decent job capturing the feeling that everything is moving inexorably forward to a catastrophic climax. Ian McKellen, who dominated in the first film, had far less to do here, but fortunately Andy Serkis stepped up huge as the mocap/voice actor for Gollum and ran the table on the rest of the cast, even if he was largely CGI trickery. Brad Dourif places second on the list of Most Captivating Portrayals for a riveting and nuanced Grima Wormtongue that supersedes the novel version. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin get a little weepy for my tastes, but that's just me. Extended Edition cut does nothing more than make the film longer-- a lot longer. Still, a big win all around."
"Nov 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Good,it was ok but my fav is the first one!"
"Nov 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,"It is the worst Lord of the Rings movie, but that's like saying that riding a magical flying unicorn through a lollipop forest is worse than riding a magical flying unicorn through a candy cane forest. 

The Two Towers, along with all three of the Lord of the Rings movies, deserves every bit of recognition it has received, but I chose a least favorite, and this is it."
"Nov 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,It definitely paid off to film these back to back because the tone remains consistent throughout and the action just gets better and better.  And Gollum is one of the great cinematic villains.
"Nov 23, 2010",NEUTRAL,"My final analyisis? It was above average, but not much else. I liked how they made Gollumn a realistic character, and not some evil freak like in the animated LOTR. It seemed a bit solw though. The worst of the 3 but still pretty good."
"Nov 20, 2010",NEUTRAL,the best of the 3 IMO
"Nov 20, 2010",NEUTRAL,much slower than the first one..but still a great movie
"Nov 19, 2010",NEUTRAL,The best movie collection ever!!!!!
"Nov 18, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Probably the most difficult film of the trilogy to make; with no real beginning or ending, however it is just as good as the other 2. The battle of Helm's Deep was spectactular, it made me want to join in!"
"Nov 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,Part two of the best trilogy ever.
"Nov 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The more diplomatically-minded film in the trilogy, the much-underrated ""Two Towers"" (then again, IMDB has it listed in the top 30 but who cares) is a very weird and beautiful mess with great action sequences and a very interesting change of pace for the adventure trilogy.

While Jackson flirted with traditional horror elements in ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" he mainly goes for body horror with this by introducing the world to the easily-parodied-but-nonetheless-disturbing Gollum/Smeagol, a hermit whose complete obsession over that one very strange ring is so intense that he doesn't give a damn about the state of his what-appears-to-be-decaying body, losing all of his teeth and hair to improper care. The corruption of power has literally turned him into an animal, albeit a very disturbed animal whose mind is split into two personalities: good and evil. Gollum adds a very psychological aspect to the novel (and film) by showing us the end product of corruption: death. He looks like one of the walking dead - hell, he acts like a zombie too.

However, the film isn't about Gollum. It's about how the other nations are preparing for the eventual Battle for Middle-Earth and how Sauron attempts to stop them dead in their tracks. In that sense, it's a more diplomatic film, giving the viewer a glimpse into the more political side of the battles and allowing Aragorn to gain a more proactive role as de facto leader. Also, it's a commentary on the destruction of nature by industry (one of Tolkien's original intentions) by comparing the naturally-beautiful places that we mostly linger at to the rusty-looking and disturbingly-designed Isengard. And it's a commentary on love and how people will make seemingly-stupid decisions to show that love transcends all things.

Then again, the focus on the film is the Battle of Helm's Deep. We focus quite a bit of time over there, showing Aragorn and this once-possessed king trying to defend a very feeble people from a million-orc army hellbent on slaughtering every woman and child in all of Middle-Earth. Only once in a while do we see Merry and Pippin talk to the trees about the ugliness of Isengard; or, hell, see Frodo and Sam slowly fray their friendship thanks to a hermit Hobbit who just wants a piece of cursed jewelry.

However, the film's problem is that it focuses on Helm's Deep and all of the fighting too much. We rarely see any character development (save for Sam, Frodo, Gollum, and Aragorn) and, again, the issue of the Dwarves, Men, Elves, and Hobbits completely annihilating the orcs mainly for defense (and implied racist) purposes is much ignored. Instead, Jackson opts for the ""born bad"" explanation I've heard way too many times in my life. Again, I want to see what the orcs feel about the whole battle - what they feel about the other races and Sauron and Saruman and Grima and all of those things. Are they just cartoon characters willing to be cannon fodder for a flashy Legolas or are they actual creatures with feelings and souls?

Other than those flaws, ""The Two Towers"" is a nice addition to the LotR trilogy. Note: it needs much more Gandalf the White. That man's the ultimate badass."
"Nov 16, 2010",NEUTRAL,This one is good. It has really good and interesting fight scenes in it. Plus Gollum has a bigger role in this one and he is one of my favorite characters.
"Nov 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,In my opinion the best out of the three movies
"Nov 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Sorry....big fan of this story, I watch all three at x-mas time....pretty much every year."
"Nov 12, 2010",NEUTRAL,"An excellent continuation of the first, this film develops the multiple storylines that grow from the fellowship breaking apart in the first film. A lot of surprises come forth, and the film is executed extremely well."
"Nov 9, 2010",NEUTRAL,All of the Lord of the Rings movies are masterpieces to me.
"Nov 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,"this is the way to go! Great running time and great depth. Each character was awesome, and i have never been more absorbed into a film. I love the books too, and The Two Tower is by far, the best adaption. I love how Jackson enhances on the story, and puts his own charm into it. Two Towers is a success!"
"Nov 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,"This is probably my least favorite of the three, but it's still five stars. My one complaint is that this time around, even on Blu-ray with DTS-HD 6.1 Master Audio, way too much of the dialogue is still almost incomprehensible. I had to go back and hit subs several times, especially with Treebeard. I still love it!"
"Nov 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,I don't know. Do we really need to break up reviews between the three Lord of the Rings films or can we just give it a standard rating? Does this film prove the theory that a second film is the best of a trilogy? No but it is still damn good.
"Nov 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,Best movie trillogy ever. There is nothing more I need to say
"Nov 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,"2/3 done!  Theo slept through most of it.  These movies aren't really what I thought they were gonna be, but I like them"
"Nov 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers is a big departure from the faithful adaptation the saga had in the previous part. The story arc divides into three parts but still turned out to be extremely well narrated. The story adds new characters without confusing the viewers, the performances are more evolved, the tone is darker, the direction is better, the visuals get a major upgrade, the battles get bigger & Gollum's performance wins hearts. Arguably better than its predecessor in some aspects, The Two Towers is a work of art filled with some great cinematic moments. The climactic Battle of Helm's Deep will always be remembered. Overall, Without a definite beginning or end, The Two Towers is a stunning masterpiece & sets a really high bar for the final part of the legendary saga."
"Nov 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,Better then the first one
"Nov 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers loses none of the flair of its predecessor. If anything, it feels even grander in scale, and stupendous battle scenes only heighten its impact."
"Nov 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,Prob my favorite of the three.  The battle at the gates was quite amazing
"Nov 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,Brilliant on every level... plus one of the greatest battle scenes ever filmed.
"Nov 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Split into three sides,which side are you on?That final act when live-Trees  and hobbits attacking Saruman's headquarters owned!Yes,I'm on that side."
"Nov 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,Likely the best adaptation of book to screen in the recent history of fantasy and literature. Outstanding.
"Nov 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,My favourite of all 3 films
"Nov 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,A la hauteur des livres.
"Nov 2, 2010",NEUTRAL,Spectacular. The escapism film.
"Nov 2, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Not as good as the first. Way too much battle scenes take away the effect for those who prefer a ""calmer"" action movie. Still a good movie. Highly reccomended for those ""action-lovers""."
"Nov 2, 2010",NEUTRAL,"If you thought the first LOTR movie was amazing, watch out for this one! It's bigger, better, more complex and much longer (which in this case is a good thing!). With an epic battle not to be missed!"
"Nov 2, 2010",NEUTRAL,Badass film. The fight at Helm's deep was awesome and the fight of the Ents. Also you get to see alot of Gollum in this film. The whole LOTR trilogy is an epic movie series that Peter Jackson and JRR Tolkien should be very proud of for years to come.
"Oct 31, 2010",NEUTRAL,Takes the middle chapter and makes it cinematically entertaining in its own right.
"Oct 31, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Simply excellent.  This hits all the right notes that the ""middle movie"" of a trilogy should."
"Oct 31, 2010",NEUTRAL,"It suffers from being the middle film: No real beginning or ending, but it still is good entertainment. It also gives us a chance to see a wonderful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum/Smeagol."
"Oct 31, 2010",NEUTRAL,Part of the greatest trilogy ever made.
"Oct 30, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The empire strikes back of The Lord of the rings trilogy
The second out does the first"
"Oct 29, 2010",NEUTRAL,OK i ma not a big fan of this movie of this trilogy better say but this movie was actually good for 2 things GOLLUn nad the battle scenes they were rat in motion so good better that i spectec  the delevolmen of the acting was actually good the movie have a relly good stuff that miss the eyes..a thing this was so good even as aÃ§good as the 3 part...but this was missview by many...no to take credit of the 3 film i enjoy this as i did with the 3 XS...if i enjoy...i dont think so
"Oct 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,"This second part is great aswell, just a wee bit slower. Still... It takes you to magical of orc, elves, hobbits... place and after watching a movie you want more. Absolutely GREAT, best movie ever!!"
"Oct 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Love all the LOTR movies, unreal!!"
"Oct 26, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Like the first film, Two Towers also takes risk with its length and increased special effects, but by retaining its cast, smart direction and absorbing storytelling, Two Towers once again proves itself to be one of the greatest films in history."
"Oct 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,really you have to see thes movies there awesome and great
"Oct 23, 2010",NEUTRAL,The best...  Just the best.
"Oct 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,A little hodgey and not as good as the first or third installments but still a really good movie all around.
"Oct 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,i have seen parts of it and what i have seen its been better than the first
"Oct 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Because of the plot and as a whole, I liked the first one better. Bur This one improves in terms of characthers and action scenes. The battle in helm´s place is superb, for example and Gollum is a great character!
So it is a great follow up for the saga and a great movie overall"
"Oct 21, 2010",NEUTRAL,If I had to pick one out of the trilogy this would be it but really it represents all three as a whole.
"Oct 20, 2010",NEUTRAL,Al alba mira al este
"Oct 20, 2010",NEUTRAL,Great sequel! I will forever love LOTR!
"Oct 19, 2010",NEUTRAL,This is just as good as the first if not better. It has all the same qualities that made the first film great. This is a fantastic sequel.
"Oct 19, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Like the books, like the movies."
"Oct 18, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Stepping up the pace of the first film of the series in a lot of places, this is a more interesting choice than The Fellowship. A bit lengthy and at times not well-focused, it's still a solid movie with a lot of entertainment value."
"Oct 18, 2010",NEUTRAL,https://sites.google.com/view/ttbreviews/our-company/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-two-towers
"Oct 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,At the time quite impressive regarding its effects. Amazing and faithful adaption. The battles are amazing.
"Oct 16, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers is most certainly my favorite part in the trilogy. Every action scene is breath-taking and epic on every level; and unlike the first one the film doesn't drag on too much. Also the characters are well fleshed out in this one, so we care what happens to them.

The films story continues were The Fellowship Of The Ring left off. As the group have gone there seperate ways; Frodo and Sam have gone off on there own to destroy the ring, Mary and Pipin have been captured by the Orcs and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are on the trail trying to save them. Frodo and Sam find Gollum who is there guide, leading them to Mordor. After Mary and Pipin escape the Orcs, they come across an Ent named Treebeard and they plan to destroy Isengard. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, find Gandalf the White and they ride to Rohan to free the King of Saruman's clutches. After that, they ride to Helms Deep and so begins an epic battle. What I like about this story is how there are three different events happening at the same time. The Hobbits do feel like they are on the side-lines not getting much action, but they do towards the end. Much more characters are introduced and we learn more about Aragorns love for Arwen, I do think that is explored a bit too much. Anyway the story is intresting, the structure can be confusing at times. but that didn't bother me.

The acting really just the same as the first one; I still don't like Liv Tyler's performance and John Rhys-Davis as Gimli (he also voices Treebeard) is still my favorite. His character is more of comic relif, I also like his complicated relationship with Legolas. They seem like very good friends, but they keep teasing each other about there race and in Gimli's case his height, I also like how they compete in battle to get the most kills. Gimli is also very eager and always wants to fight, like in the Warg Rider fight when dead Warg Riders kept piling on top of him and he was missing all the action. Sam does seem rather obsessed with looking after Frodo and always asks him if he is alright. We should of seen more of Mary and Pipin, I like the actors who play them and in this they seems to not move much, while the others are usually miles ahead, were we see Mary and Pipin at the start is where we see them at the end. Great acting by all, bar one.

I would like to say that these are some of the best action scenes put on film, even the minor action scenes are better then anything Michael Bay can do. The Helms Deep battle is an amzing acheivment in filming and I frankly don't want to know how they did it, because it will ruin the experience of that epic scene. I also thought the scene when the Ents destoryed Isengard, was also as good as the battle of Helms Deep, despite it not being very long, but you have to see it to beleave it. I love the script more then the first movie, I love the conversations they have, I love all the humor they put into it and not once was it boring. Gollum, how can I not talk about him? He is also a fantasic acheivment. His personality disorder is very intresting, the way he argues with himself, fantastic. 

I never noticed the soundtrack to this film. When the credits came up, I got up to turn it off, but before I could press the eject button on my PS3, a very beatiful song came up. I don't know the name of the song, but it made me drop my controller and I just listened to it right through the credits. That was the icing on the cake, to this film; that song.

Overall; The Two Towers is, amazing in every single way, I can't think of any flaw apart from Liv Tyler, it is a step up from the orginal.
9.8/10"
"Oct 16, 2010",NEUTRAL,a stunning achievement
"Oct 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers is a great, GREAT film. It is not as awesome as Fellowship of the Ring, in my opinion. The Two Towers is a magnificint film that improves the Lord of the Rings franchise. Again, The Lord of The Rings films take like 3 hours, but again it is all worth each minute of it. I give this movie an exact 98%, a better score than Fellowship of the Ring. So overall, this is an awesome film that everyone will like! But warning: Orcs may be scary to the little ones. But little kids will probably love the film as well cause of the whole journey to destroy evil. Again, you will love it!"
"Oct 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,Probably the best of the 3...loved Helm's Deep.
"Oct 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,the best fantasy mideval movies
"Oct 13, 2010",NEUTRAL,Applaudable Fiction. The writer i.e R.Tolkien is trully blessed just like R.L Stine.
"Oct 12, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Again, too long, but full of action and insight thanks to Peter Jackson."
"Oct 12, 2010",NEUTRAL,loved the sceens of the movie .
"Oct 12, 2010",NEUTRAL,AKA short guys walking part 2
"Oct 11, 2010",NEUTRAL,i never thought i would watch people walk for hours.... and i never intend to again..... aside from that creature that appears to be decomposing before your eyes wich i found very amusing i believe i would of died watching this one
"Oct 10, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The ironic thing about Lord of the Rings is that it gets better after each sequel, unlike most movies that lack the depth and story it had from the first movie.

I immensely enjoy The Two Towers and the development of the story, and the different places in Middle Earth where different charactres exist and different situations are going on. I have to say that the trees kind of annoy me because of the slow response they have in helping to save the world. However, the story is pure excellence.

10/10"
"Oct 10, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The acting is magnificent and the visuals are as thrilling as ever. Beautifully directed by Peter Jackson, The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers reigns as a superb epic fantasy film that should not be missed by any Tolkien's fans."
"Oct 10, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Interesting 3D´s and Mythological Film, Part Two; Classics"
"Oct 9, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Wow, I had no idea how phenomenal of an actor Elijah Wood was, until I saw him absolutely nail this double role. Well, actually, I guess it's more like a triple role, what with Sméagol's split personality. Oh sorry, that's not Elijah Wood, it's Steve Buscemi, who really shows just how excellent of an actor he...- no, wait, that wasn't him either. Sorry, but the CG was so phenomenal that I just can't buy that chunky, ape-faced Andy Serkis as Sméagol, and it doesn't help that his performance is so unbelievably stellar and transformative, that he doesn't even give us the slightest bit of hint in his voice. Really, my only problem with his performance is that he picked the wrong film to be great in, because when you're dealing with ""The Lord of the Rings"", you don't stand a chance of being the only good thing in the film. Still, he is among the most impressive things in this film, which is really saying a lot. Still, no matter how great this film is, it's not quite up to par with its predecessor, being as flawed as ever.

Okay, now, I'm okay with no recaps of the previous film if the follow-up is a direct continuation of the story, but I'm not okay with immediate development being lacking, let alone when it's completely absent. Now, it's much harder to develop the follow-up in a series than it is to develop the beginning of one, because we've already established the characters and must find away to re-establish the emotional conncetion and only that, but really, the writers could have at least tried, because the storyline has become so scattered and so complex that with this lack of emotional development, it's hard to lock into the film, causing any immediate sense of tension or emotion - of which there is a deal right out of the gate - to ring false. Sure, development gets there, but it's a rough road, partially because we're once again dealing with the previous film's flaw of scenes going on as long as intended, which is a long time, and yet, more events than ever feel rather abrupt and forced. Something else that has gone down in quality is the writing, which isn't absolutely terrible, but still packed with cheese and some pretty bad dialogue. Even the cool sequences are plagued with dialogue like ""Release him, or I'll cut your throat..."", which I know doesn't sound too bad, but now I want you to imagine that it's being said by Elijah Wood with an English accent. Now, I'm not saying that Elijah Wood is bad, but the more cheesy material is at its worst during his, Sean Astin and the newcoming Andy Serkis' segment, and it only gets worse from there. Still, although there is much to complain about in this film, for every small fault this film makes, it makes many more accomplishments, and although it's not quite as fine as its predecessor, it's still kicked things up a notch in a few departments.

There's no not talking about one of these films without praising the technical, even if you have before, and sure enough, there's no way around repeating myself when I say that the technical value is beyond masterful, with stunning cinematography boasting such slickness and width in the scope to capture every bit of the glorious production designs that are so lively, so inventive and only matched by the visual effects, that are absolutely stellar. However, here, they've toned down the scope of the CG and are now using them in more intimate places, and that's what makes these visual effects better than those of the last, because you get to see just how seamless the CG is as they create authentic life with it. Seriously, Elijah Wood's eyes, looked so real, even though I knew that no one's eyes could be that big. No, I am of course, refering to Treebeard. No, I'm talking about the Sméagol/Gollum effect. Now, I'm going to stop pretending that I'm talking from 2002 and talk to the people of 2009, who walked out of ""Avatar"" saying that it was groundbreaking in its CG, and say that they not only broke that ground seven years from then with this film, but ""Avatar"" isn't fit to shine the shoes of the CG characters in this, especially Sméagol, who is so seamless and authentic-looking in his interactions with the environment, movement and of course, his appearance, that even though there's no way that someone can look like they're in this bad of shape, you still haven't the foggiest that this character is merely the spawn of modern filmmaking at its finest. Of course, another reason why you can't tell is because the guy behind it all gives it his all, which isn't to say that he doesn't leave some room for his co-stars to shine.

Something that a lot of people don't realize is the this series has solid performances all throughout it, and this film is no exception, featuring a wide cast of very distinctive and memorable characters, all portrayed with charisma and talent, and you'll often find yourself glued to the screen, not just because of the phenomenal eye-candy, but because you get many fine performances, particularly by our young Hobbit cast. Here, our big-footed, but generally tiny leads are given more to do, with the exception of Elijah Wood, who is once again only asked to do a solid English accent and convey the pressures pushing down on his shoulders sharply, and let me tell you, he does just a good a job as ever. Still, the spotlight now focuses more on Wood's buddies, and I must say that it was worth the wait to see Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd get to show off more of their charm, which isn't to say that it wasn't also a thrill to see Sean Astin establish himself as a leader, but one who still needs to learn a thing or two if he's to get the job done. Still, no matter how great everyone is, it all comes back to Andy Serkis, who is one of the finest examples of a solid CG actor who can do more than just throw on the gear. Now, I know that Sméagol is CG, but he's an overlay of a real performer, and if you pay attention, Serkis' physical performance is so believable, so distinctive and really defines the pains of his character, though not quite as sharply as his ability to nail the painful, yet rather human mannerisms and characteristics. Something else worth mentioning is his more subtle bits of acting, and yes, again, I know that Sméagol is CG, but that makeup reaches the facial regions, and Serkis really know how to give the effects team plenty to work with, because his facial performance is so authentic and tough to watch, that even if he wasn't digitally transformed and stood before us as Andy Serkis, he would still transform into this entirely different person, or people, if you will. Speaking of which, let us not forget Serkis' absolutely phenomenal job at nailing this split personality in a fashion that doesn't really have you believing that he is with two minds interacting with each other, but that he is an unstable, easily manipulated soul that is going through a constant internal battle with these two entirely different people, thus making him one of the most compelling types of antiheroes out there: one to summon sympathy, as well as tension as he leaves you to wonder if his next move is going to be good or bad, as well as questioning if any of his moves were ever ""genuinely"" good to begin with.

Now, I finally come to the end of this chapter in a fashion that this film taught me is the best: with explosive action. Now, as much as I loved the first one, the action was too good to come around every once and a while, and for those who felt the same, I hate to break it to you, but the action in here isn't that much more prominent. Still, what action there is is worth the wait, but what really makes this action more worth discussing than the action in the first one is the final battle, which is one of the greatest climactic war sequences in the history of film. I could go on all day about how amazing the final war sequence is, but I believe that I can best summarize my praise for it by simply saying this: Monsters, warriors, elf archers, a dwarf with a battle axe, wizards and giant tree people, all for a glorious 30-plus minutes. It definately makes it past the really high standard set right out of the gate, with a hook that is a repeat of what was an emotional sequence in the predecessor. Only this time, Pete Jackson says ""Now that we've gotten all of the mushy stuff out of the way, let's see what really happened"" and leaves us to kick back, relax, and enjoy an explosively amazing action sequence that immediately sets a near-impossible standard for the rest of the film, and I assure you that said standard does not go unmet, if not surpassed. Still, although I joke about Jackson cutting out the emotion of that scene, a repeat of the emotional resonance wouldn't have fit the tone, but Jackson makes up for that by doing what he can to develop emotion so that when all of the heart and tension come into play, it delivers.

At the end of the day, although all of the faults made by the predecessor, as well as a lack of immediate development and plenty of cheesiness keep it from being up to par with the preceeding film, the dazzling technical value and powerhouse action spice up this still very compelling story that is carried by its solid cast of performers - particularly Andy Serkis - and director Peter Jackson, leaving ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" to still stand as a true work of art and satisfying continuation of the magnificent saga.

4/5 - Great"
"Oct 9, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Better than the first and had my attention. Still nothing shouts ""obsess over me"" like qualities of Harry Potter and Star Wars but still it had alot of great action. Andy Serkis gives a wonderful and creepy performance and the usual Brits that I love like Ian McKellen are great as ever."
"Oct 9, 2010",NEUTRAL,THE BEST FILM I EVER SAW
"Oct 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,"I think it is the best trilogy of all time. My super-favourite too! I love all the castings, they portray the characters, really, really well. Superbly done, JRR Tolkien would have been so proud .. :)"
"Oct 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,The best of the LoTR series. And that's saying alot.
"Oct 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Decent movie, though it departs in some annoying little ways from the book.  The battle of Helms Deep is probably the most satisfying of all the big battles in the trilogy."
"Oct 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,Words cannot describe how much I love this film.
"Oct 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,New classics!  Peter Jackson is someone i'd stand in line to meet!
"Oct 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,One Of The Greatest Movies Ever Created.
"Oct 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,I've never seen better war scenes.
"Oct 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Such an amazing sequel, its very rare for a movie to be better then its first, and The Two Towers nailed it completly. One of the best sequels to a movie ever and personally my favourite Lord Of the rings picture of the three. Its historical battle near the end was so epic it kept my eyes glued to the screen like every time, never really blinked. You see alot more in depth on how the story is progressing further, more characters are included. Its battles, love, humour and setting is all a five star special. This is precision."
"Oct 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,My favorite of the trilogy
"Oct 2, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Great middle to the trilogy, but it's the weak link in the chain."
"Oct 2, 2010",NEUTRAL,One of those movies that made history... Is a 10
"Oct 1, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Like Sam, I would reject Gollum. Speaking of Gollum, the CGI that brings him to like is amazing. Like the Fellowship, it is awesome."
"Oct 1, 2010",NEUTRAL,"More things are taken out and several scenes are put in. Gollum's portrayal is perfect.
Furthermore there is that spectacular scene of Boromir giving a post-battle speech, inspiring and magnificently written, perfectly acted by the excellent Sean Bean."
"Oct 1, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Though the plot feels less coherent, the Two Towers still achieves as an incredible film.  Andy Serkis's turn as Gollum is haunting."
"Sep 29, 2010",NEUTRAL,"By far, the best from the trilogy! <3"
"Sep 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,Best movie of the trilogy!
"Sep 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,real old movie. tight
"Sep 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,The Two Towers is a spectacular movie.  The dramatic battle of Helm's Deep was breath taking. Why all three parts of the trilogy is not in the RT top 100% list beats me. I can watch this trilogy again and again and again.  I can't wait until the extended edition version is released for Blu-ray.
"Sep 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,Theoden steals the show. Most underrated character in the series.
"Sep 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic continuation of the journey from Frodo and Sam in their mission to save Middleearth. Peter Jackson's return to continue his job to delivering one of the grandest entertainment in this century. The plot is more intelligent, more mature appearance of the Wood, McKellen, and Mortensen, as well as drama and action has a far more powerful, making this adaptation of JRR Tolkien's book as the best of the trilogy. Good job!"
"Sep 26, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyable, in spite of some narrative turns that don't help the flow or the ideas behind the story. Chief among these are the Aragorn ""death"" scene, Faramir following his lust for the ring, and Frodo offering the ring to the Nazgul. That said, Gollum is fantastic, as are all of his scenes with Frodo and Sam. Helm's Deep is also a very well-executed battle scene, as is the Ents' cleansing of Isengard. Well done, even if a bit overblown in places."
"Sep 26, 2010",NEUTRAL,best sleep i've ever had
"Sep 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Widely known as the lesser of the three in the Lord of the Rings saga, it can be a major snooze-fest! The Two Towers has the awkward set up of being the middle act. Jackson, wisley steals events from the first chapters of the Two Towers and supplants them in the first film to wrap things up nicely. Unfortunately, this makes Two Towers even worse.

It begins on a high recapping the amazing battle between Gandalf and the Balrog. Then its all down hill, Gandalf goes on some acid trip and comes back dressed in white with lack of memory, like he returned from the looney bin. 

Then we get Aragorn and his merry men running in fields for 30 minutes, blah!

This movie is mired by elf-lore, talking trees and Liv Tyler. All three together will give a warm bed and liquid nyquil a run for their money. Elves are a stuffy, pompous bunch, who blibber blubber about the misgivings of others. Treebeard and his wooden-woodies are painful to watch, making me check an infomercial on axes and saws and go crazy in a forest. Liv Tyler has zero chemistry with wide eyed Aragorn. In fact if Jackson casted Queen Latifah instead, things would be much more interesting.

Too many cut scenes to boring elf/tree jazz, instead of focusing on action. The climactic scene at Helms Deep is one of the best moments in cinema history for example, then there is a cut away to Treebeard figuring out something to say, and taking a very long time to say it. When did Gimli the Dwarf become scottish? The Hobbits start to get really annoying too. You find yourself rooting on the orcs to make hobbit stew.

Gollum steals whats left of the film. What a wonderful character, schizophrenic, double personalities and hideous to behold. I remember his performance, (by Andy Serkis) pushed actors in general to re-think awarding roles done in CGI.

I also disliked the men of Rohan, and wished they lost. King Theoden is an egomaniac, dumb and insecure.  

The film, still every bit technically good as the first and last, lost all sense of adventure to me, and ended on a sour note. Probably one of the worst film endings out there. But what can you do? Return of the King is the smallest book of the 3? The scope of this film and the next keeps growing in scale, and becomes more and more epic, moving further away from what made the first film so sublime."
"Sep 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Now that they've introduced the story, they get to the interesting part right away. There's a bit of boring talking, but the dialog is usually pretty interesting. This time, there's better action and more of it. The battle sequences are amazing. When the slow talking trees come around, they don't mind smacking the crap out of what ever they can reach and causing mass destruction. I always forget that Frodo and Sam are the main characters because so little of the movie is on them. But I'm never bothered by this because they make the rest of it fairly interesting. The visuals and musical score are both as beautiful as ever. The action a great improvement on the last one but is all saved for the end. Not as good as the first, but still a great movie."
"Sep 23, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers, the second installment in the best trilogy of all time, The Lord of The Rings, comes out swinging in this masterpeice of a movie. Just as the first the visuals, acting, screenplay, score, and directing are phenominal!  Andy Serkis does a fantastic job that stands out from the rest as unique and original. Amazing job!"
"Sep 23, 2010",NEUTRAL,One of the greatest fantasy films of all time. A testament to how brilliant a filmmaker Peter Jackson really is. Great stuff!
"Sep 20, 2010",NEUTRAL,LONG! Bur still a good movie!
"Sep 20, 2010",NEUTRAL,"This is definitely my favorite one in the series. It has the best battles, and it is just really captivating. I love it."
"Sep 20, 2010",NEUTRAL,My comment is under Return of the King
"Sep 19, 2010",NEUTRAL,Not enough happening
"Sep 19, 2010",NEUTRAL,"omg this is was so so amazing . def going on my fav movies list . it was alot better than the first one personally . the 3 hours was amazing like many movies in one.... the acting and characters were great too ,..... cant wait to see third now"
"Sep 18, 2010",NEUTRAL,"After being complete awe of the first film and knowing they filmed the entire trilogy at the same time: i had little doubt this film would be great too. However i was not expecting it to completely obliterate all of my expectations.  The film (like the rest of the trilogy) is one of the purest works of fiction you'll ever come by, and yet it still manages to find mountains worth of material with witch one can identify. Oh yes, and the battle of helm's deep is only one of the finest battle sequences ever filmed."
"Sep 18, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Too long, lost interest"
"Sep 18, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Ok, surely better than the first one but still..."
"Sep 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Sep 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Another breath taking Lord Of The Rings movie, I loved it, A MUST SEE."
"Sep 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,watching 2nite! luv it!
"Sep 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,Still watch it sometimes on DVD. fantasic storyline.
"Sep 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Perfect sequel. Peter Jackson took the rescue to bring Tolkien's work to the screen with one of the most complex film projects in recent years. The Two Towers was the most difficult to do for two reasons:
A) For being the one in the ""middle"", it has neither a beginning nor an end, so he must engage the audience from the start and motivate the public to see The Return of the King, the final.
B) The Two Towers is the weakest of three books and take it to the screen needed alot of skill and charm and visual impact to viewers.
The three films were shot at the same time, evidence of the great assembly. The three tell the same story, the three present, and this no less than the rest: impressive costumes (especially the dresses of the Rohirrim), both natural scenery and by computer really impressive, so faithful to the descriptions in the novel... Here stands the milieu of Edoras and Helm's Deep, especially Meduseld Castle.
Drama, war, adventure, fantasy, all combine in this superproduction. Jackson once again demonstrated its capacity.
Soundtrack to a category admirable, the Rohan theme is beautiful and epic, perfectly conveying the warrior heart of this people that Tolkien translated so well in the novels and Peter Jackson in the movies."
"Sep 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Excellent sequal.  The drama that unfolds all leads to the eventual grand battle.  And what a battle it is.  Helms Deep is quite possibly one of the best epic battle scenes in all of film.  Thats saying alot.  I can recall almost every visual and sound in that whole sequence.  This to me was the best movie of the trilogy.  Well directed from open to finish, excellent acting and the special effects were unbelievable.  The sheer fact that a CG character like golum could be considered for a supporting actor award is telling of how well edited this film was."
"Sep 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,seen it its brillient
"Sep 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Superb 2nd installment just slightly inferior to the 1st film due to the suprise and scenery elements having gone, but deffo my favourite films ever."
"Sep 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,This one is just as good as The Fellowship of the Ring. But it was Gullum who stole the show. Andy Circus is really good playing him. The battle of Helms Deep is pretty spectacular to watch. And the ending makes a perfect tie into Return of the King.
"Sep 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Best film ever, based on the best story ever!"
"Sep 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,"It just doesn't lose a beat, there is no drop off in quality of cast, story, scenery, or performances."
"Sep 2, 2010",NEUTRAL,to be honest brilliant story telling. i much enjoyed  everything it was for its time.
"Sep 2, 2010",NEUTRAL,"I have to tell you, The Two Towers is defiently an outstanding sequle and it's intensely thrilling. In the film, Frodo Baggins(Elijah Wood) and Samwise Gamgee(Sean Astin) continue thier way to Mordor as Middle Earth stands on brink of near despair as the forces of Sauron and Saruman(Christopher Lee) beging waging war on Rohan and it's people. Can Frodo and Sam make it to Mordor and destroy the ring before chaos strikes. Your gonna half to watch the film and find out.

I really have to say, The Two Towers is one of best film achivements of 2002 and it's one of those sequles that raely work. This is probably the darkest installment of series and it offers alot of depth the The Fellowship of the Ring couldn't provide. I also have to admit that The Battle of Helms Deep is the best battle scenes in cinema history. It's very actioned packed, the films story is epic, the visuals are fantastic, and it succeeds in where other sequles fail. My tomatomter rating is a 98 precent. The Two Towers in my option, is a must see, is completely epic, and is thrilling to the last minuet."
"Sep 1, 2010",NEUTRAL,"un film de milieu de trilogie, ils sont rarement bons !"
"Aug 31, 2010",NEUTRAL,"When I first saw this movie I absolutely hated it. I walked out of the theater all in a tizzy over something someone who has not read the books may find silly, Faramir was kind of a dick and that cocktease ending where they cut off just before Gollum leads the Hobbits to Shelob. I've since grown to realize that the movies were far more human than the books and it's okay to have a character whose morals are torn, and after watching Pirates of the Carribean 2: Dead Mans Chest, endings where the fates of the characters are not very well wrapped up leading into the next film kind of suck donkey balls. So basically I've since grown to forgive Jackson and the like especially after watching Return of the King in all its glory and upon re watching The Two Towers have grown to love it as well for its innovative epic battle scene at the end and perhaps most of all Gollum who is perhaps the most artfully crafted CGI character of all time. While Fellowship still holds that special place in my heart, Two Towers in many ways surpasses its predecessor but also begins the long line of Lord of the Rings cornball deus ex machinas. Ah well, are these movie fan boy hype or the real deal? Lets take a look.

Alright so the film opens with an eagle circling a snow capped mountain screeching already drawing imagery from the Misty Mountains in the First film...well that and you can hear Gandalf (Ian McKellan giving a much more subdued performance this time) shouting from within, followed by the camera zooming in to the Mines of Moria and a reenacting of Gandalf's death at the hands of the Balrog from the previous film. However as he falls we follow him this time and he continues to battle the Balrog until the chasm bottoms out into an underground lake which is one of the coolest movie scenes you'll ever see. But it's all just a dream as Frodo (Elijah Wood, as the films progress and Frodo becomes increasingly more deranged Woods performance gets surprisingly versatile) awakes with a cry. Frodo and Sam (Sean Astin, wasn't as big a part of this one as the other two) are traveling through the bleak hills they overlooked at the end of the previous film. One night they're attacked by the creature Gollum (Andy Serkis, weird as shit but my god this man has got to be some kind of genius)who wishes to retrieve the ring that Bilbo had stolen from him so many years ago. Frodo however binds him by the power of the ring to be their guide to Mordor which he promises fearfully to do. Anyone else think this sounds like a terrible idea already? Eh, I'm giving to much away. In the city of Rohan mean while, Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson, continuing to be sexy badass personified), Legolas (Orlando Bloom, not an elf but a fairy) and Gimli (John Rhys Davies, gruffer than a mother fucker) the latter two whom further develop their humorous buddy cop friendship, fearlessly pursue some Uruk-Hai who still have Merry (Dominic Monaghan, god he's in an Eminem video how the mighty have fallen) and Pippin (Billy Boyd, always entertaining) captured. Meanwhile at evil Sarumon (Christopher Lee...ahhh what a voice) is behest orcs and men are raping and pillaging the land of Rohan while ailing King Theoden (Bernard Hill, in one of the film's best performances as the torn and guilt ridden king) is being poisoned into complacency by his evil steward Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif what a creepy but awesome motherfucker) we see a scene of a mother sending her kids to the capitol on horseback while a city is destroyed. Happy stuff...Theoden's nephew and head of the cavalry (The Riders of Rohan) Eomer (Karl Urban, also quite fantastic as the bitter and betrayed warrior) informs Theoden that his son, the Prince has been killed by Orcs and angered at his seeming nonchalance attacks Wormtongue calling him a spy and as a result is banished. Roaming the land trying to reestablish order the now nomadic Eomer and his Riders attack the Uruk Hai one night allowing Merry and Pippin to narrowly avoid being eaten but the film cuts away right as a horse is about to bash in Pippin's skull. 

Meanwhile Frodo and Sam make their way through some marshes to avoid a scouring airborne ringwraith and Gollum saves Frodo from drowning as he's hypnotized by some corpses. At long last they reach the Gate and a scene unfolds oddly similar to the scene outside the Wicked Witch's castle in the Wizard of Oz...Gollum however pleads them not to attempt entry that way as they'll be captured and tells them of a secret passage he'd neglected to mention until literally the last minute. Sam who's a sensible Hobbit is suspicious but Frodo thinking to how Gollum saved him in the swamp agrees to go his way. Aragorn and company run into a bitter Eomer who tells them he destroyed the Uruk Hais that they were tracking and he regrets to say that none where left alive. He warns against going to the capitol and they part ways. The trio investigate the battlefield and Aragorn in tracker moves that would put CSI to shame discovers (and we see as he discovers...again very cool scene) the hobbits did manage to escape and made it into the large Fangorn forest where (though the trio doesn't realize this) they are rescued and taken to safety by a large talking tree or Ent named Treebeard (John Rhys Davies) one Deus ex Machina I won't complain about because I love Ents and the movie does them well. The trio however do run across a shiny wizard who they think to be Sarumon and attempt to attack but reveals himself to be Gandalf...the White. It seems after killing the Balrog he was granted rebirth as Gandalf...The White. I love Gandalf...I'm Glad he's back...but that's just stupid and the movie knows it as it doesn't even try to explain the logistics of it. Ah well, the four now travel to the capitol of Rohan and fuck up Wormtongue's little operation and exorcise Sarumon from inside of Theoden. Wormtongue is about to be killed by Theoden when Aragorn stops him saying nobly enough blood has been spilled on his account...Wormtongue consequently is allowed to escape to Sarumon noone stops him...This is really fucking stupid. I'm not even being blood thirsty here HE'S GOING TO HIS EVIL LORD AND YOUR ENEMY TO TELL HIM EVERY WEAKNESS OF YOUR STRONGHOLD. Enough Blood has been spilled on his account? Way to go Aragorn thanks to you it will be fountains more...I get a little mad about that, poor judgment maybe you shouldn't be King Aragorn. Theoden is brutally awoken to the horrors of what has happened and after seeing the two kids from earlier arrive decides to take his people to bunker down in the mountain stronghold of Helms Deep rather than risk open war despite Aragorn's protests. Oh all eager for blood now are we? Gandalf knows Sarumon's Uruk Hais will destroy the castle without help so leaves to retrieve Eomer and the Riders promising to be back on the sunrise of the fifth day. The people begin a mass exodus to Helms Deep and Aragorn forms a close friendship with Eomer's sister Eowyn (Miranda Otto who does pretty darn good), on the road trip and discusses with her how his previous love Arwen (Liv Tyler, she cries and rides horses that's it) is being pressured heavily to leave Middle Earth with the other elves by her father Elrond (the always excellent Hugo Weaving) which we then actually see happen. In the meantime Wormtongue is at Sarumon's tower and tells him that the people are going to Helm's Deep and how to destroy the wall. Sarumon adresses his massive army to leave no one alive. Great fucking call there Aragorn.

Gollum has up till now faithfully lead the Hobbits to their destination but at night we see an inner turmoil within him that shows Jackson as a master director and Serkis as a mad genius. I dunno something about that scene where Gollum and Smeagol (Gollums good side basically) do mental battle for control is rife with tension, brilliant character development and even a bit of humor. Good, GOOD Shit. Frodo and Sam not to long after Gollums epiphany are captured however by Rangers from Gondor. Meanwhile we get a pretty cool scene where some Orcs riding Worgs attack the Rohan people and are pretty effectively destroyed but one drags Aragorn off a cliffAlso to be noted is Legolas mastery with a bow he can shoot a target while doing this weird swing, flip thing onto a horseREMEMBER this. Meanwhile Elronds basically going fuck Middle Earth and he and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) postulate on if this is the right course of action. So Frodo and Sam find themselves in the stronghold of the Rangers or whatever and in the hands of Faramir (David Wenham, is there a not solid performance in these movies?) who is, you guessed it Boromirs brother. It seems theyve found his body set adrift in the last film and hes rightfully suspicious of Frodo who admits to being his traveling companion and claims not to know of his fate. Faramir also tricks Frodo into admitting Gollum is with their crew when they threaten to kill the creature which is fishing on their sacred grounds if it is of no consequence to the Hobbits. Through Gollum he learns of the ring and seeking to impress his daddy takes the Hobbits and the rings to Gondorright across the river from Mordor. Aragorn is awoken on a shore byhis fucking horse not shitting you. He sees the approaching army on his way to Helms Deep and somehow beats them there warning everyone and leading to fear and tension in the ranks as to how outnumbered they are even Legolas. However word is sent to the Elves of Lothlorien and that cool cocky elf from the first one shows up with a battalionreally quickly, ready to fight. God these Uruk Hai are slow as shit.
 
The Battle at Helms Deep was probably the most epic thing any movie audience had ever seen in terms of fantasy warfare or even just movie warfare, Braveheart would have shit itself. Its impossible to describe its a long action driven battle but basically the Uruks are raising these big ass ladders to scale the wall and the Rohan people are pushing the ladders off and picking off Uruk Hai with their archers. The cocky elf guy dies regrettably and theres some pretty amusing and badass moments from our three protagonists, Banter between Gimli and Legolas, a reference to a line from the previous film Nobody Tosses a Dwarf! and Legolas surfing down some stairs on a shield shooting mother fuckers all the way. Shit gets weird when one Uruk decides its time for the lighting of the Olympic torch and starts running with the torch to this like hole in the castle wall Wormtongue has revealed to be a weakness. Legolas is ordered to take him down. That thing is moving slow as shit, Legolas actually puts two in his arm but cant bring him downTHIS GUY HAS BEEN ABLE TO SHOOT ANYTHING THAT MOVES THE WHOLE TIME AND SUDDENLY WHEN ITS CRUCIAL HE SHOOT ONE GUY HE CHOKES? My God. Anyways Merry and Pippin and Treebeard have called an Ent meeting. Ents are lazy bastards and talk really slowly but after some rallying words and a showing of Sarumons devastation of the forest, the Ents set out to kick Sarumons Wizard ass.

Now the conclusions of all three of these storylines (four if you count Gandalf) I wont reveal but I will say theyre all epic well done and its basically the opposite of Empire Strikes Back, read into that what you willOk I mean that this sequel ends with the bad guys getting the shit kicked out of them or thwarted at least on all fronts. Much like the last one it sets itself up nicely for the sequelIn Sam and Frodos case at least but not shameless or cliff hangerly. An excellent film and a brilliant sequel yet again Jacksons found that medium between shameless Blockbuster fun and art."
"Aug 30, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Continues the Lord of the Rings trilogy and it sure is better then the first one, which i didn't like as much.

The sequel to the fellowship of the ring is a lot less boring then the first film as it contains some very intense,and awesome medieval battle scenes. The movie also improved in the technical levels, as it contains some breath-taking CGI. The film is still beautiful and emotionally brilliant just as the first film, and I thought Smeagle the creature gave quite an amazing performance, creeping me out but also making me actually shed a tear for him. The first half of the film was a little boring but the second half is full of EPIC events taking place, and makes me (a person who never was interested in the LOTR trilogy, and thought the first was boring) very eager to see the final and for sure to be ""EPIC"" film.

rating: 75%"

"Aug 29, 2010",NEUTRAL,Great movie. While the first was probably better on a technical level The Two Towers stands firm and offers even more of what The Fellowship of the Ring delivered.
"Aug 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, even though it is my least favorite of the trilogy, the movie is still excellent."
"Aug 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,a good sequel to a good film
"Aug 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,I think its the best one of the three the visuals are amazing and I love it!!!
"Aug 26, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The third best of the trilogy. But, you can't say the worst of the trilogy because there's absolutely nothing negative about this film at all. The others are just more perfect. This installment of the trilogy introduces new characters as the adventure splits into different paths. We meet characters like Eowyn, Faramir, Eomer, Theoden.....in which the supporting actors portray brilliantly. Again, as in the first film, the supporting cast really adds to the movie. The fighting scenes in this film are so epic. The Battle of Helm's Deep is so awesome. 
This is a great, perfect film that adds depth, emotion, and character to the trilogy."
"Aug 26, 2010",NEUTRAL,"What is it with these movies, seriously?  I just can't put my finger on it how Peter Jackson was able to direct such a perfect series!  I'm not really sure what to say, but I love to watch these movies over and over again.  The Two Towers was a daring sequel to the Fellowship of the Ring.  And Viggo Mortensen was easily the best person for the part of Aragorn.  I cannot even imagine someone else playing as him."
"Aug 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The best of the three in my eyes, ""Two Towers"" takes the solidly developed characters and thrusts them further into Tolkien's vast world of trolls, orcs, dragons, and other mythical beasts. Our heroes don't seem to stand a chance, and it's all the more exciting to see what they make of the circumstances. Every battle sequence is impressive, and every character is given opportunity after opportunity to continue fleshing out."
"Aug 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,The extended version of the Two Towers is at times very painful to watch... Most of the additional footage revolves around Arwen & Aragorn and is absolutely dreadful... What was always the weakest of the trilogy has been made even worse.
"Aug 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,I just want to watch it again!!!
"Aug 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,Beautiful with amazing battles.
"Aug 23, 2010",NEUTRAL,One of the bet movies of 2002!!!
"Aug 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,"I like Fellowship of the Ring more...but barely more. The Two Towers is the middle film of the LOTR trilogy and it delivers. The Battle of Helm's Deep is one of the best battles to ever be portrayed on screen and just like the 1st film, the acting is flawless and the music blends in perfectley with every scene. The CGI Gollum is also a amazing achievement as he looks almost real in several scenes. Again, one of the best films ever made to one of the best trilogies ever made."
"Aug 21, 2010",NEUTRAL,My favourite in the trilogy and plenty of Andy Serkis to go around
"Aug 21, 2010",NEUTRAL,boring but good and well done
"Aug 20, 2010",NEUTRAL,"A standing ovation for all concerned.,The Two Towers can only be explained in one word, beautiful. This film left me breathless. I was hoping for a film that could stand in the same depths of the Fellowship of the Ring, and I must say that it has surpassed the film completely. I will have a hard time watching the Fellowship and seeing the ending, knowing there is so much more waiting."
"Aug 18, 2010",NEUTRAL,An all-time favorite of mine.
"Aug 18, 2010",NEUTRAL,As for me - the most epic part of 3.
"Aug 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,"seamlessly move on from the first the way a second part of a true trilogy would.  The scale is not quite as grand as the first, but we do get to know the remanding members of the fellowship better, and care for them more.  The battle of Helms deep also gives us a idea of what the final on will look like, yet stands different and amazing by its self.  My only complaint is there is not enough Gandalf, but that is made up for in the next chapter."
"Aug 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,Absolutely in tune with how I imagined Middle Earth
"Aug 16, 2010",NEUTRAL,My favourite of the Trilogy
"Aug 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,Great epic a really great storyline and action
"Aug 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,september's eleven tribute...can make you die with agaony wishing the end.
"Aug 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,"""A NEW POWER IS RISING..""

     Flat-out breathtaking.  A masterpiece.  An absolute visual astonishment.  Epic.  Thrilling.  An absolutely legendary cinematic achievement, The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers has done the impossible, it's improved upon nearly every aspect of the ground-breakingly legendary first film.  Director Peter Jackson (The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring, The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King, King Kong, The Lovely Bones) has brought us yet another splendidly, beautifully crafted epic piece of astronomically legendary visual and cinematic standards.  These films are setting groundbreaking new standards in cinema, including spectacular use of crystal clear CGI, special effects, action sequences, set designs, costume designs and storytelling.  A gorgeously extravagant breathtaking epic that's vast and incredibly sprawling from start to finish.  Peter Jackson and company have once again transformed the words on the pages of J.R.R. Tolkien's books into an extraordinary motion picture, The Two Towers astonished me in every way possible.  An instant classic in every way imaginable, a masterpiece in every sense of the word.  The Two Towers is an adventure of a lifetime, the second film in Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings trilogy is an adventure of a lifetime, it's simply one of the most extraordinarily spectacular adventures to ever be put on film.  The story really gets the ball rolling as things in Mordor heat island more evil is unleashed throughout the realm of	Middle Earth.  It's a supremely gripping, wickedly visual, astoundingly absorbing, insanely entertaining, endlessly eye popping and dazzling action packed master work.  No doubt that the third film is guaranteed to shock the world and somehow top the first two films.  just as the first film was, Two Towers is a long haul, clocking in at a solid there hour run time, the perfect way to kill a rainy or snowy day.  Absolutely spellbinding, a flawless gem of legendary film making.
     Peter Jackson and company deliver a top notch cast once again, and many forms of various talents are unleashes in front of your very eyes.  Elijah Wood once again secures the starring role as Group, and gives a brilliant performance.  Sean Astin is back as Samwise and does great once again.  Ian McKellen reprises his spectacularly legendary role as Gandalf The Grey.  Viggo Mortensen returns and is more brilliant than ever before.  Liv Tyler, Jonathan Rhys-Davies, Billy Boyd, Cate Blanchett, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Sean Bean and Andy Delis round out an all star cast that speaks for itself."
"Aug 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,"This is one of those very rare ""middle-of-the-series"" movies that is just as good as the others. It moves along and answers questions while still nodding towards the final movie. Also the battles are epic"
"Aug 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,Una peli mejor: Las dos torres versiÃ³n extendida!
"Aug 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,"BEST MOVIES EVER. WEITHER U LIKE THEM OR NOT, TOP QUALITY."
"Aug 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,A fantastic intepretation of a classic novel
"Aug 12, 2010",NEUTRAL,The trip to Mordor that momentarily went off track.
"Aug 12, 2010",NEUTRAL,These movies are perfect. I'll never be able to read the books again without seeing these films in my head.
"Aug 11, 2010",NEUTRAL,"This movie also had a lot of action and a good story to it. The ending seemed a little better although of course the story goes on. At any rate, this is definitely worth watching."
"Aug 11, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Peter Jackson does it again with the second part of his Lord Of The Rings trilogy. The Fellowship is no more, and sam and Frodo head to Mordor alone. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli rescue Pippin  and Merry.  The story unfolds really quickly, and the film doesn't waste time in telling this awesome story. The film seems well paced and way more action packed than the first film, as theres always something going on on screen, thats not saying that the first one sucked, far from it; it was terrific.  But this one as the War Of The Ring is beginning, has of course more action than the first.  The Two Towers is an incredible sequel to an incredible film. It is a work of genius that is greater than epic.  The actors really shine here, more than they did in the first. Everything is bigger and better in this film, the battles, the characters the special effects, everything. The Two Towers is a towering film going experience that you won't forget for a long time to come. One of the greatest things about this film is the battle of Helm's Deep, exciting and epic, you will definitely be blown away by the scope of this battle, it's action packed and delivers one of the most exciting fantasy battle scenes  ever filmed. Peter Jackson is a master filmmaker, and The Two Towers proves it once again."
"Aug 9, 2010",NEUTRAL,Los mejores paisajes
"Aug 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,"My favourite of the LOTR saga, The Two Towers pulls all stops out and achieves the rare feat of the second in a trilogy being the superior film. Passionate and scary, The Two Towers takes LOTR to a whole new level with sparkling cast additions and a more fast-paced, adrenaline-fueled plot."
"Aug 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,"An instant classic!! Initially When I watched the movie when it first came out I had no idea it was a book or had this much back history so I somewhat expected it to be like a Harry potter type because it came out around the same time. It had me dialed in from the beginning til the end, I wouldntve minded if the movie was 6 hrs because I didn't want it to end."
"Aug 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,One of the first on screen battles that literally made my jaw drop.
"Aug 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Andy Serkis steals the film as Gollum, but the battle of Helms Deep is immense!!!"
"Aug 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Perhaps not as emotionally jarring as the first and third movie in the trilogy, but still a wonderful movie, filled with battles, treachery, despair and... Gollum."
"Aug 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,They overemphasized Gollum. It took time away from progressing the story. So they were forced to push some of book 2's story into the 3rd movie...
"Aug 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,amazing view and scene
"Aug 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,"While some might consider it to be stretched, The Two Towers delivers even more creative ideas and the moral of fighting for what we feel is right, along with everything that made the first LOTR so spectacular, resulting in yet another heartwarming, adventurous, and well constructed fantasy epic."
"Aug 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,Leaps and bounds above the first.
"Aug 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is the second of three chapters of the great tale of The Lord of the Rings.  It is just as good, if not better than the first film, and it sure is a delight to behold.

This time around, the entire fellowship has been broken up: Frodo and Sam are still on the long road to Mordor to destory ""The One Ring to Rule Them All"", but a trecherous creature named Gollum is hot on their trail, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli take the war path as a humoungous army of Urak-Hai under the command of Saruman is headed to the land of Rohan, set out to destroy them.  And finally, Merry and Pippin get lost it The Dark Forrest and learn more wisdom than ever from the great and wise Treebeard.  The whole thing could easily have become a big mess, but it is well organized, great fun, and well done.

The highlight of the film for sure is the ending, nearly hour long battle of Helm's Deep, featuring some of the best special effects for the time, but would it be topped?  Find out later.  If there is one leg of the trilogy that has been the most passed up on, it is saddly this one.  The third film lives on in infamousy, and the first is also well-remembered, but this one is left in the dark.  It is still great, but why is it forgotten?  High praise from me."
"Aug 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The battle to be lord of the rings continues.  Now the bat boy is trying to jack the ring along with a myriad of other monsters and shit.  Meanwhile there's some dirty motherfuckas trying to storm the castle like fat bitches storm the walmart.

Then some trees come out of the woods and fuck shit up!"
"Aug 2, 2010",NEUTRAL,Adequate film adaptation of the book. Well done Mr. Jackson
"Aug 1, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The third best of the trilogy. But, you can't say the worst of the trilogy because there's absolutely nothing negative about this film at all. The others are just more perfect. This installment of the trilogy introduces new characters as the adventure splits into different paths. We meet characters like Eowyn, Faramir, Eomer, Theoden.....in which the supporting actors portray brilliantly. Again, as in the first film, the supporting cast really adds to the movie. The fighting scenes in this film are so epic. The Battle of Helm's Deep is so awesome. 
This is a great, perfect film that adds depth, emotion, and character to the trilogy."
"Aug 1, 2010",NEUTRAL,my favorite in the trilogy
"Jul 31, 2010",NEUTRAL,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,"" continues the journey to destroy the Ring of Power. Frodo, and his companion Sam journey to the Fires of Mordor, with the creature Gollum at their side. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli follow a band of Uruk-hai and Orcs, who have captured Merry and Pippin and are taking them to the evil wizard Saruman, who also has the king of Rohan under his spell.

This all seems clustered, yes? Well, fear not, because it's all very good, all the way to the end. Once more, Peter Jackson serves up some great visuals and story as we see so much turmoil with the characters. Many messages are brought out, but I will not talk of them because you'll have to figure them out yourselves. Please see it; it's much better than the first."
"Jul 31, 2010",NEUTRAL,Definitivamente que Lo mejor de lo mejor eso no hay duda
"Jul 31, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Brilliant follow up to Fellowship, the Battle of Isengard is huge and grand!"
"Jul 30, 2010",NEUTRAL,"i have a few ring ,can share with someone"
"Jul 30, 2010",NEUTRAL,The best in its trilogy. Lots of tower defending. This movie is why I watched LOTR 4 times.
"Jul 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,The battle of Helm's Deep is over; the battle for Middle Earth is about to begin.
"Jul 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,"*** Good. 
My personal favourite of the three films. The major battle scene is undeniably impressive."
"Jul 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Even though I didn't really know what exactly was going on all of the time (blaming lack of concentration for that one..and the fact that a lot of the characters look EXACTLY THE SAME), it was still clear that this second installment was much better than the actionless and overlong (is that a word?) first movie."
"Jul 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The most iconic and awe-inspiring of the trilogy in my opinion. The entire trilogy is an amazing experience, but this movie outshines the rest. The scene where the Ents go to war is engraved in my mind forever along with some of the best quotes out of any movie. Helms Deep is also one of the best filmed battles ever to be in a movie."
"Jul 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,A sequel that no doubt triumps over its predecessor.
"Jul 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,"what a story to follow up  woo, all the people they use and creature they use they out did them self it was the greatest, those are the great movie of all time."
"Jul 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,Read the books.  Maybe watch the first or third.  Skip this one for sure.
"Jul 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,"A very good sequal to a very good first, the story really starts to unfold and the battles are much better than in the first. Here the length actually starts to help, immersing you in JRR Tolkin's world."
"Jul 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Seeing as how there's no real beginning or conclusion, it's amazing that this film is so compelling.  Mortensen deserved an Oscar nomination here, as did Andy Serkis as Gollum."
"Jul 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Dramaturgisch geschickt wird der heterogene Mittelteil des Buchepos fÃ 1/4r zahlreiche ruhige und poetische Momente genutzt, wobei sich in der digital animierten Figur Gollum reizvoll das zentrale Thema um Besessenheit, Verzicht, Treue, Verrat und Freundschaft bÃ 1/4ndelt."
"Jul 26, 2010",NEUTRAL,"My favorite of the trilogy, and consequently on of my favorite movies of all time. 

No one can deny that these movies are the visual representations of JRR Tolkien's masterpieces, and with all of the iconic scenes in this part of the story it's easily the greatest segment of middle earth's story. My favorite scene? When the Ents go to war!"
"Jul 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,"While this is the ""middle child"" of the series, I still maintain that this film hold some of the best battle sequences of the series with Helm's Deep and Isengard. This is also the film that really picks up on the action and dives into the meat of the story (where <I>Fellowship of the Ring</I> dragged at times). One of the few movies I wanted to see again immediately after viewing it the first time."
"Jul 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,watched it countless times and i dont get tired of this fantasy world and characters! The lenght is what i love the most could watch more every time.... the quest to save middle earth... Great trilogy! cant talk about only one lov the hole story!
"Jul 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The Journey continues and keeps getting better, this is one of the best middle chapters to a film trilogy that you will ever see, it deserves its place along side The Empire Strikes Back."
"Jul 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,I forgot how awesome this movie is
"Jul 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,I created a word for this series fantagasm.
"Jul 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,I think this is the best of the three in the series simply for the massive scale of the last battle. WOW that was an amazing film acheivement. Gollum makes the movie though with who wicked he is and his relationship with Frodo and Sam make the movie.
"Jul 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The trilogy is obviously one of the greatest of all time, but I think this one is the best of the three.
It has the most raw and dark feeling to it.  It is the greatest of the three.
The first one was dull at points because of a good deal of exposition and the last one ran just a bit too long, but the second one was quite close to perfection.
Helm's Deep was awesome."
"Jul 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,Best of the trilogy!
"Jul 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Great stuff, amazing watch.."
"Jul 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,This was my favourite of the Lord of the Rings films.
"Jul 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,"It is a good film with a very defined direction, but the length is killer. I actually did fall asleep in the theater while watching it."
"Jul 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,"I actually read this book before i read the fellowship so i got the story backwards. anyways about this film the action is awesome as usually. The story is long and it's got some kick ass trees, Tree huggers should find entertaining."
"Jul 23, 2010",NEUTRAL,Yup the same... Looong
"Jul 23, 2010",NEUTRAL,My favourite in the Trilogy!
"Jul 23, 2010",NEUTRAL,The extended cut explains the motives of the characters better
"Jul 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,much more action than the first one
"Jul 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The second movie in the series.
There is more action in this one.
This is a must see movie.
One of the best movies of all time."
"Jul 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,The story is the best ever... the movie is good!
"Jul 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,Can't stand these movies...
"Jul 21, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Not my favorite part of the story.  Too much battle for the pure sake of having battle, and its a bit slow moving compared to the other parts..."
"Jul 21, 2010",NEUTRAL,I'm a geek.  And I love LoTR
"Jul 21, 2010",NEUTRAL,a movie i wish i have never seen
"Jul 21, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The fate of Middle-earth is uncertain.  Taking off where the last film left us, Jackson again tells the Tolkien story with amazing clarity.  It seems like each film in this series is subsequently better than the next.  Kudos to Peter Jackson on the Battle for Helms Deep.  Also, Andy Serkis deserves honorable mention for his role as Gollum.  The depth and passion that he brought to that role was undeniably genious."
"Jul 21, 2010",NEUTRAL,An accellerating and thrilling middle part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy! Andy Serkis gives a brilliant preformance as Gollum!
"Jul 21, 2010",NEUTRAL,"And the adventure continues. A well-done film, but not nearly as solid as the first. In many ways the low point of the series, but stilll a great ride."
"Jul 20, 2010",NEUTRAL,All the LOTR movies are great.
"Jul 20, 2010",NEUTRAL,"They got me on the first one... The first one was very good, but this one was just slow and so weird (talking trees)! UGH!!!!!!! Do not see it.... :)"
"Jul 19, 2010",NEUTRAL,"""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is way to better."
"Jul 18, 2010",NEUTRAL,The second part is mostly fighting which is action packed and interesting !
"Jul 18, 2010",NEUTRAL,With all Lord Of The Rings films the casting is excellent. This particular film is one of my favourites from the battle with the two towers to a quest for the rings destruction played an important role and was interesting to see what paths await for all the main characters.
"Jul 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The extended edition was unforgettable. the theatrical again, was all right."
"Jul 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,really awsome movie loved every minute from start to finish.
"Jul 16, 2010",NEUTRAL,I LOVE Lord of the Rings!
"Jul 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,Best movie. Little people have important roles to play.
"Jul 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,The best Trilogy ever. This is just on a class of its own. I commend those that be for being able to match the parfection of the original
"Jul 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,Best of the 3 in my opinion.
"Jul 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,just amazing the all 3 films
"Jul 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The speech, the battles, the story once again, the humor and the weird creature that captivated all eyes, Gollum remote to 100%. The most wonderfull movie every made continues it's journey going 90%+, almost perfect...but for me simply goes 100%!"
"Jul 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,Final Verdict: Still perfection and expands upon the Trilogy with the addition of Gollum and an Amazing Finale at Helms Deep.
"Jul 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,"This movie was a very worth while experience and I have enjoyed watching it over again even to this day. Let me start out by saying that there are 3 main parts I like for in a movie like this. The first is the ability to transition from novel to movie form in a flawless manor and I really do feel that the Two Towers was good at doing that. 
    The second is the effects and acting. I really do feel that the acting from Elijah Wood Viggo Mortenson and Ian Mckellan have probably one of the best triple threat acting performances ever done on Film. Viggo is the calm cool and collective B.A Aragorn(The Ranger from the North). Ian is the Smart and tactically genius grey wizard gone white Gandalf(The White Rider). Finally Elijah is the Small protagonist of the story with the weight of everyone that is good in middle earth on his shoulders Frodo(The Halfling). 
      The smaller cast also does a Phenomenal Job. I mean the Regulars Orlando Bloom (Legolas the Elf) John Rhys-Davies( Gimli the Dwarve) as well as the other Hobbits Sam, Merry and Pippin(Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd) all play a great part in this movie. Now on to the effects. The Warg attack on the traveling Rohan people ,  the attacking of Isengard by the Ents and the battle of Helm's Deep are all cinematically beautiful pieces of art.
      They are all well done. Also the transformation of the Ent's from inanimate to animate and the CGI on the Warg's is done terrifically. Now to the third part. The third part I look for in a Movie is how new characters are introduced and acted out. I do not consider A new character as part of the second element of the three. 
       The Rohanian's Theoden,Eowyn, and Eomer are all phenomenally portrayed by Bernard Hill, Miranda Otto, and Karl Urban. Eowyn's forlorn love for Aragorn actually caused me to feel a sense of Emotional sorrow that she could not have him. Theoden did a good job making the transformation from brainwashed King to their leader at the Battle of the Hornburg. Eomer also did a good job as the outcast nephew of Theoden and brother of Eowyn as well as the leader of the Eored.
         In the end I would have to give J.R.R Tolkien's Plot a 10/10 Peter Jackson's Directing a 9.5/10 The Acting of the Cast a 9/10 and the effects/screenplay a 8.5/10 which comes to a 37/40 or a 3.7/4.0 stars. Being that this is a fantasy film I will round it up to 4.0 as a handicap for all fantasy films."
"Jul 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,seen en all and really liked em
"Jul 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,Part 2 of 3 parts of the single best movie ever made.
"Jul 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,A great sequal to the already fantastic series.
"Jul 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,"i still can't deside which of the three films i like the most and i don't think i ever will, simply timeless"
"Jul 13, 2010",NEUTRAL,"I so loved this movie, not sure if a Fantasy sage can surpass LOTR."
"Jul 13, 2010",NEUTRAL,"This was most likely the best of the trilogy. The action and acting was better than the first, and the story was definitely more colorful than the first as well. Despite these great parts, I felt the movie had focused too much on the action instead of character development and script. A"
"Jul 13, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Better than it's predecessor, but obviously not as good it's successor, ""The Two Towers"" had a good mix of every that the trilogy encompasses."
"Jul 13, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Of all the books, this was the one I didn't really like. HOWEVER, even though it was not the BEST of the three...it was still a good movie with good performances."
"Jul 12, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Certainly a very good movie, great acting. However, you just have to follow the storyline closely so that you don't get lost!"
"Jul 12, 2010",NEUTRAL,"This film works, but it's just too long for me to truly enjoy it."
"Jul 12, 2010",NEUTRAL,"An excellent middle chapter in the trilogy. Pretty much everything about it is perfect: great writing, great acting, great special effects, great direction, great music, great art direction. I had forgotten about Sam's excellent speech at the end, which pretty much sums up everything that is great about The Lord of the Rings and storytelling in general. It also hit me much harder this time just how much of a tragic character Smeagol/Gollum really is. If you can get over the wonderful visual effects that created him and the funny voice and actually think about him as a character, his story is just so sad and painful. I really felt sorry for him this time around. This movie also has a lot of Treebeard, which is awesome. (Did you know Treebeard was based on Tolkien's friend C. S. Lewis? Well he was.) I also noticed that King Denethor of Gondor was also Walter from Fringe. There's just so much to love and admire in these movies, it's astonishing."
"Jul 12, 2010",NEUTRAL,Best part of the trilogy.
"Jul 12, 2010",NEUTRAL,"With even better visuals, characters, and scenery, ""The Two Towers"" manages to be even better than the first one. The one downfall, though, is that some of the special effects are completely unbelievable (people flipping onto their horses, for example, is impossible). Despite this, the movie deserves serious consideration in terms of what movies you want to have in your collection."
"Jul 12, 2010",NEUTRAL,the books are better :)
"Jul 11, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Ahhhh, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. Another reason for Americans to get more major landscape envy because New Zealand is just so damn beautiful in this movie. Oh, and did I mention that Peter Jackson is a great director? From New Zealand, too. For once, I can be proud of something that New Zealand has done in the film industry. If only we could do more of this kind of stuff.
Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their journey to destroy the One Ring they have in their possession. They meet a creature who once had the Ring, Gollum (Andy Serkis), who they trust to lead them the right way. The people they left behind are now launching an attack on Isengard, making the battle for the Ring bigger and worse than they had expected. 
I liked The Two Towers a bit better than The Fellowship of the Ring because this one has a higher entertainment factor. I think this was probably because of the character Gollum, who we see a lot more of and turns out to be quite a mysterious character; albeit an ugly and crazy one. What I like about it is that it is crammed full with characters, but it doesn't turn into a usual mishmash of people because the depth and characteristics of them are evident, even if they have some pretty short scenes (like Cate Blanchett as Galadriel). 
Again, what can I say? I know it. Everybody with half a brain knows it. The Lord of the Rings films are masterpieces. And just because I can, I'm gonna say this is the best thing New Zealand has ever done. The Two Towers is a fantastic second installment, if only other sequels could be as good as this. I look forward to the last one. 
Another thrilling chapter to The Lord of the Rings, better than the first, but only by a whisker."
"Jul 11, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The second installment to the trilogy, and wow, the end of the movie leaves you at the edge of your seat wanting more and more of the movie. Great acting, great storyline, what more is there to say? Tolken wrote a great book, and the directors took that and made a better movie!"
"Jul 11, 2010",NEUTRAL,The Second Part of the Ring Series. Good Action and The Battle are reall good. The Actors are good as well and the new characters fits in this Story. This Movie is an Masterpiece and only the next One is better.
"Jul 10, 2010",NEUTRAL,Seeing Gollum for the first time was hugely memorable.
"Jul 10, 2010",NEUTRAL,two words: Helms deep

"Jul 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,LOTR. All I have to say.
"Jul 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,Really good but too long should have been done in two parts.
"Jul 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Filled with great action, and marvelous visuals that dazzle to this day The Two Towers is a very worthy sequel."
"Jul 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,"once again I see no flaws here other than length. And the Length of a film doesn't really bother me at all. Why? because the film is so epic, so well done, length doesn't bother me one little bit. Lord of the Rings the Two Towers is a great fantasy epic film and peter Jackson really knows how to deliver with excellent cinematography, sets, effects, and story. Bravo Jackson, Bravo."
"Jul 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,The worst in the series.

"Jul 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,No flaws at all. Incredible and intense
"Jul 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Possibly the weakest of the trilogy,but still a fantastic film by all measures and not to forget some of the greatest battle scenes ever orchestrated..."

"Jul 2, 2010",NEUTRAL,"I never read the book for this book in the trilogy, but I love this movie. A great fantasy film."

"Jun 29, 2010",NEUTRAL,"cant stand the soppy,whinging hobbits but the movies and most of all a great story......"
"Jun 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The journey that was started in The Fellowhip of the Ring continues in The Two Towers. But this time, the fellowship has been seperated into three groups ever since the ending of the movie. Boromir is dead and Merry and Pippin were captured by Saruman's forces with Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas are on their trail. But most importantly, Frodo and Sam are on their way to Morder to destroy the One Ring of Sauron.

Since The Fellowship of the Ring proved an enormous success among audiences, there was of course going to be a lot of excitement for The Two Towers and The Return of the King. Is this movie as good as The Fellowship of the Ring? Yes, it is, but it's also better.

The Two Towers starts right where The Fellowship of the Ring left off. The first few minutes show us what really happened to Gandalf (Ian McKellen). In the previous film, when we saw the grey wizard fight against the Balrog of Morgoth, he was pulled down with it. Now we see that they were actually fighting as they fell into a nearly bottomless fall.

Then it cuts to Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) on their way to Mordor. But they keep getting lost. But then one night, Gollum (Andy Serkis) attacks them to try and steal the Ring. They manage to subdue him, but Frodo makes him their guide to Mordor. As they travel, we see that the creature has split personalities: the meek and more kindly Smeagol, and the greedy and sinister Gollum. Frodo grows to trust him, but Sam despises him.

Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Ryes-Davies), and Legolas are following the Uruk-hai who captured Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), who eventually manage to escape into the Fanghorn Forest, which is occupied by Ents. The chase leads them into Rohan, the home of the horselords, which is led by King Theoden (Bernard Hill). But he is under the venomous influence of Saruman (Christopher Lee) through his servant, Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif).

Saruman is intending to wage war against Rohan to eliminate those who would oppose Sauron. But not all hope was not lost. Gandalf has come from beyond the grave, now more powerful than ever. He is now Gandalf the White. And when Theoden recovers, he must prepare his men for war against Saruman's forces at Helm's Deep.

This adaptation of the second book doesn't cover everything that was in its source material. The film only tells about two thirds of it. The first chapter, The Departure of Boromir, was moved to the ending of The Fellowship of the Ring. The Two Towers goes through chapters 2-7 from Book III (Aragorn, Gandalf and the others' story) and chapters 1-6 in Book IV (Frodo, Sam and Gollum's story). The rest would be inserted into The Return of the King.

The transition is also not quite as faithful as The Fellowship of the Ring was. Plenty of things are left out and some things are changed (like the elves arriving at Helm's Deep and Frodo, Sam, and Gollum are taken by Faramir and his men to Osgiliath). Some of the characters personalities are a little different, too (particularly Faramir). But as with Fellowship, it carries the heart of the book.

Just as with its predecessor, the movie has an excellent story and is technically stunning. The visual effects are excellent. The best of them are used on Treebeard and the other Ents. The makeup done on the Uruk-hai is also worthy of note. But the really good parts are the action scenes. There's the fight with the Balrog at the beginning, a fight with Wargs, but the battle for Helm's Deep is a highpoint and one of the best battle scenes in cinema.

The acting is just as great, and even better than it was in Fellowship. And even then it was excellent. The actors are really starting to grow into their characters. Elijah Wood makes Frodo's struggle with being the Ring-bearer believeable. Sam is also a great companion to Frodo and is a more braver character than he was in the previous film. Gandalf, who doesn't have as much screentime this time, is still the perfect Gandalf. Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn is more heroic in this as he takes on army of Uruk-hai. And the two duos of Merry/Pippin and Gimil/Legolas are also fun to watch.

The supporting and new cast is also quite good. The most engaging is Andy Serkis as Gollum, who makes the split personalities really work (particularly in one scene in the middle of the movie). Christopher Lee gives it his all as Saruman and like Ian McKellen does with Gandalf, he embodies the role. Bernard Hill gives a voice of authority as King Theoden. Brad Dourif gives a chilling performance as the sly Grima. Miranda Otto makes a good Eowyn. Karl Urban doesn't get very much screentime, but he makes a good Eomer. David Wenham also makes a good Faramir. Hugo Weaving, Liv Tyler, and Cate Blanchett also have small appearances in the movie.

Just as I loved The Fellowship of the Ring, this I also love."
"Jun 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,This series is overrated. What's the big deal?hobbits are so gay. Hobbits & blue ppl from avatar are both lame cool battle scenes . The few there are.
"Jun 9, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Brilliant film, best of the three - main battle scene one of the most sucessfull in film history"
"Jun 9, 2010",NEUTRAL,Retarded as the best movie ever in my opinion. Peter Jackson at his best!
"Jun 9, 2010",NEUTRAL,i love it toooo much
"Jun 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Greater than the first i guesss,, but the first is amazing in the way it starts off the entire story.
The Two Towers is better than the first!!! 
Great film. Again!"
"Jun 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Man, I'm such a geek:) Books were amazing too!"
"Jun 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Jackson's ability to adapt a movie so nicely detailed from Tolkien's book is astonishing. However, unlike the first film, there is a great amount of details, stories, and important plot lines that are missing from the book. I understand that there is a time limit, and Jackson does a great job in telling a cohesive story through the film without the detail, but looking at some of the scenes and trying to act like I have never read the books I began to realize that there were just too many details missing in the plot line that didn't really work in the film itself. The seeing orb for one has an entire backstory to it and the motivation behind Wormtounge seems to lack. 

One thing holds true, the graphics and locations in this film will surpass time. Visually a masterpiece, performance wise brilliant, and the battles give that outstanding feeling and wow factor that can only be delivered by such an amazing editing job and battle sequence."
"Jun 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Wonderfully done, excellent movie."
"Jun 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,Watched this movie again after a long time and loved every bit of it.
"Jun 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Everything you learned in Fellowship of the Ring better be common knowledge at this point cause part 2 of the epic trilogy doesn't stop to breathe for a moment. This movie throws in new locations, characters, and creatures(Gollum namely) and keeps it all in balance. The story could not have been told better that it is right here. Cinema at its best in every aspect and everyone who has witnessed these films will tell you the same. Movie perfection that will have you screaming to see part 3"
"Jun 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,1/3 of the best films ever
"Jun 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,The best of the trilogy.

"Jun 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,I think I liked the second one a bit less than other two. But it was nice.
"Jun 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,The best film of probably the best trilogy ever made.  Helms Deep might be the greatest movie battle sequence.  I ride with Rohan!
"Jun 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,"All 3 of these are parts of a whole, a tribute to the great classic by J.R.R. Tolkein, crafted by a great Director, Peter Jackson. Definitely in my Top 100 films of all time!"
"Jun 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Awesome, Loved it!
Good Old Good vs Bad. 
Amazing Effects & Good Storyline!"
"Jun 2, 2010",NEUTRAL,I love Golum...thats all i watch it for...lolz..:)
"Jun 1, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The saga CONTINUES!  I got the chance to sit down and watch the 223-minute special extended edition, and man, The Two Towers is still just as epic as I remembered.  Samwise and Frodo continue their journey to destroy the ever-powerful ring in the fires of Mount Doom.  But, at the same time, the Dark Lord Sauron is building an enormous army with the sole purpose of trampling all of Middle Earth.  Man is the first species on the extinction list, and they fight for their lives on two fronts.  The Two Towers is where we are officially introduced to the tragic character of Gollum; his story is such a sad one, and the way they handle his character with seamless special effects is beautiful.  The CGI and special effects here, even though they coming up on being eight years old, still hold up and look great; they look better than 95% of what we are getting in movies today.  There is a certain craft about the making of this trilogy; you rarely see the fantasy genre approached with such care, and Peter Jackson, with his camera dynamics and movie-making comprehension, was the perfect person for the project.  I still have to watch it again, because I still havenât seen it since it first came out on DVD, but I think I may prefer the theatrical cut to the extended.  Donât get me wrong, the extended cut more than merits a watch; there is a lot more character development and motivations defined.  I prefer the extended cut of The Fellowship of the Ring because you get a much richer back-story to this magical world you are being introduced to.  With this second movie, however, the first two thirds of the movie are just building and building to a climactic third act that kicks your ass.  Building wonderfully, yes, but you still want to get there before the 150-minute mark, and the added material, while insightful, doesnât allow the movie to flow as fluently as the theatrical cut.  It is an engrossing movie with every 10-15 minute scene just flying by, but the extended cut is for hardcore fans only."
"Jun 1, 2010",NEUTRAL,the best film from the trilogy
"Jun 1, 2010",NEUTRAL,Everyone needs to read these books and see the movies.
"Jun 1, 2010",NEUTRAL,Battle at HelmsDeep... best medival battle scene ever!

"May 31, 2010",NEUTRAL,Even better than the first one.
"May 30, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The Lord of the Rings story is unnaturally good, and this movie continues the brilliance The Fellowship of the Ring began."
"May 30, 2010",NEUTRAL,Please check into an editor for all three of these.... good movies but geeeeeeeeeeeeez they are long.
"May 30, 2010",NEUTRAL,Continues a great story with more action pact drama...things really start to come together.
"May 30, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Another great lord of the rings film! Just when i think they can't get any better, they do! I have no idea how!"
"May 29, 2010",NEUTRAL,Great special effect and battle scenes cudnt score it any lower got that very reason and I liked the intrige right at the end with the little troll creature gorro.
"May 29, 2010",NEUTRAL,"the best in the series, the two towers is a darker sequel and the battle at the end is monumental."
"May 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,"It is a masterpiece ... One of the best trilogies ever ... Excellent story that can classify different dates in history of any country ... It has love, war, battles, good acting, great direction, amazing effects, great scenery, great casting, awesome soundtrack, great sayings with deep meanings over time! I recommend it without reservation ... This is not boring ...!"
"May 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Better than the first one, and the continue of a great journey!!!"
"May 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Great movie. There were a lot of great actions scenes, the ending battle stealing the show. The acting was great all around, with each characters personality shining through their actors. I also have to note, the scenes with Gollum were amazing, its amazing how much personality something that doesn't even exist can have. The best film of the series."
"May 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,I love the lord of the rings! they are very good movies
"May 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,<3<3<3<3 Once again another brilliant job done!!!!
"May 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,"This fantastic film features what must be one of the great battle scenes created on film. The middle film of the trilogy, the changes made from the book worked well. This film truly uses all its budget in creating the story on a grand scale."
"May 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,Even better than The Fellowship Of The Ring.
"May 26, 2010",NEUTRAL,My favorite of the series. Great movie.
"May 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Esta secuela es mucho mejor que la primera. No solo por que contiene mas accion sino por que sigue un patron de secuencias esquisito. Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers es increiblemente poderosa, dirigida por uno de los mejores directores de todos los tiempos y del cine moderno, Peter Jackson."
"May 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,This was my favorite one of the three.
"May 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The director Peter Jackson's scrupulous devotion to the spirit of J. R. R. Tolkien's ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy manifests itself in a gripping, intense fashion for the second of the film adaptations, ''The Two Towers.'' It may be the first sequel that does not bother to reprise the major plot elements of its predecessor immediately; the plan is to simply drop us right into the action.

Even for those deeply immersed in the material, this stratagem creates a few moments of apprehension -- the same disconcerted quality that the hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are experiencing on their journey; this mission began in ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' when Frodo was entrusted with the ring that gives its bearer enormous powers and, incidentally, begins the end of life in Middle Earth, as was indicated in the first ''Ring'' movie, ''The Fellowship of the Ring.''

Never has a film so strongly been a product of a director's respect for its source. Mr. Jackson uses all his talents in the service of that reverence, creating a rare perfect mating of filmmaker and material. Mr. Jackson's ploy in this beautifully considered epic is to give viewers the same feeling of confusion that his characters are experiencing. By doing this he simultaneously answers those who complained that too much of the previous ''Rings'' was about setup.

A brief recap of a climactic battle between the friendly wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and a fire demon -- one of many climactic battles from ''Fellowship'' -- is shown near the start. But this scene is used to set ''The Two Towers'' in motion. It is a daring gambit to have viewers enter a movie bearing such complex preceding action with so little information. Even though the first film took in enough cash to jump-start the flagging United States economy single-handedly, Mr. Jackson does not seem to understand that there are people who haven't absorbed the ''Rings'' chronology into the entirety of their beings. And there may even be folks out there who haven't seen ''Fellowship,'' but will be lured into theaters for ''Towers'' by all the attention that ''Fellowship'' attracted. Such moviegoers may feel left out, puzzled and unable to keep up.

With the narrative of ''Rings,'' Tolkien was investigating determination, loyalty and, finally, faith, finding innumerable ways to offer up the concept of purity of heart, as found in Matthew 5:8 and in Kierkegaard, whose contention was that purity of heart was the ability to will one thing into being. The pursuit of purity is at the center of ''Towers.''

For our hero, Frodo, whose quest is to purge the forces of menacing evil from Middle Earth, purity is demonstrated by combating the temptation to wear the ring and be consumed by its corrupting power. He gets a taste of what the future might be like when he and Sam meet Gollum, a hobbit who was once seduced by the ring. He is now an emotional and physical shambles; emaciated and slunk into a perpetual crouch, Gollum's translucent, waxy skin is a membrane that just barely contains his insides.

Gollum is divided within himself; he is an infantilized wreck who wants to please and befriend the hobbits. But he is also a hissing, bitter child-man whose paranoia keeps him breathing, and plotting. Gollum is a computer-generated creation and as fully realized a character as can be found in ''Towers'' -- perhaps the most fully realized. (He has been dropped into the movie more effectively than George Lucas crammed Jar Jar Binks into his recent ''Star Wars'' addenda.) With the voice of Andy Serkis, whose movements were also copied by the animators, Gollum is torn by his nature, and Mr. Jackson allows him to be conflicted in a way none of the other characters in the film are.

This is partially because ''Towers'' is more or less a bridge to the finale of the ''Rings'' trilogy due a year from now, though this picture is one of the most accomplished holding actions ever.

So, much of the flow of ''Towers'' is dictated by the amount of information that has to be saved for the next installment. Mr. Jackson compensates for that by inflating the warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) into an even more assured, reflexive action hero. He helps a bewitched king (Bernard Hill) defend his castle against the endless, possessed armies of the villainous magician Saruman (Christopher Lee), the foe responsible for the fate of Gandalf. In his flowing white gowns and beard, Mr. Lee's warlock is a force to be reckoned with because he alone has a voice as commanding as Mr. McKellen's.

In sheer action mechanics, Mr. Jackson's achievements in ''Towers'' are even more compelling than what he managed the first time around; he has given the martial scenes of this sequel a completely different thrust. His engrossing action style is exciting and dramatic; when the swells of Saruman's army crash into the walls of the king's castle, we could be watching Orson Welles's ''Chimes at Midnight'' as directed by George A. Romero -- Shakespearean-scale bloodshed and loss as an exploitation movie. The exultant creepiness of horror films is Mr. Jackson's instinctive filmmaking style. He exaggerates it here in epic terms, and the grandeur is astonishing -- one scene of Saruman's creatures flinging themselves at the castle is framed as an overhead shot, with their shields moving like the wings of a peculiarly lyric and fatal insect.

Mr. Jackson's mastery of craft in some areas is so powerful that the flaws are more noticeable than in the first film. The little-boy allure of the storytelling in ''Towers'' is sure to evoke the same reaction that it did in ''Fellowship.'' ''Towers'' is like a family-oriented E-rated video game, with no emotional complications other than saving the day. Women have so little to do here that they serve almost as plot-device flight attendants, offering a trough of Diet Coke to refresh the geek-magnet story. (It is a lapse in Tolkien's work that Mr. Jackson has not figured out a way to correct, even with the token reappearances of Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett from the first film.)

Mr. McKellen is a marginal presence this time around, which is unfortunate because he is needed for ballast; ''Rings'' is such a kids' fantasy that a daddy figure is required. He is the father who soothes his charges under the spell of Tolkien's bad-dream threats. But he does get one -- only one -- whooping chance to do so in ''Towers.''

The most incredible accomplishment of ''Towers'' is that at its heart it is a transition film that lasts nearly three hours and holds the viewer's attention. Because ''The Two Towers,'' which opens worldwide today, has to keep so much story in reserve for the last installment, the movie falls short on emotional involvement. Still, Mr. Jackson rises so completely to the challenges here that I can't wait to see his next movie -- by that, I mean the one after the ''Ring'' cycle ends."
"May 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,my favorite of the series. Long as well but action packed
"May 23, 2010",NEUTRAL,Very good. No disappointments here.
"May 23, 2010",NEUTRAL,NUMBER ONE MOVIE THAT YEAR
"May 23, 2010",NEUTRAL,A new power is rising.
"May 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,Excellent Cinematography and a great
"May 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Simply, even better than the first film, The Two Towers is pure perfection."
"May 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,"""They are all one movie!"" -anon"
"May 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Better than the Book, because its more exciting and visual. like the others great battle scenes, costumes, props, sets, locations."
"May 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The film may not be as good as the first and third films, but still the Two Towers is an epic adventure of bravery"
"May 21, 2010",NEUTRAL,Revenge It's Not Good But Payback it's No. 1
"May 21, 2010",NEUTRAL,this is the part where I truly liked LOTR :)
"May 20, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Best in the trilogy, you can literally feel the despair durin the battle of Helm's Deep, poor elves lol"
"May 18, 2010",NEUTRAL,Una de las pocas secuelas q supera la primera!! I highly recomended!
"May 18, 2010",NEUTRAL,Best trilogy ever made!
"May 18, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The battle of Helm's Deep makes this film, as the rest merely seems plodding build-up to it. But the battle scenes are so fantastic, I actually went and tried to read the book. Then realised it was turgid, incompetently written crap."
"May 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,A lot of action that made up for the boringness of the first installment.
"May 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,Second favorite of the trillogy. I enjoy watching this one because of the battle of Helms Deep.
"May 16, 2010",NEUTRAL,"I had tremendous trouble caring about this movie as it snailed through its 3 hour running time, climaxing in a very poor final battle scene. Yes, most of the acting and special effects are good, but my goodness it's boring."
"May 16, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Sin duda alguna... me encantas estas películas... las historias, los vestuarios... y ni se diga de Nueva Zelanda..."
"May 16, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Sometimes the 2nd part in trilogy's can be poor but this is not the case. We are introduced to new characters (Treebeard, Golum, Eowyn) and places (Helms Deep, Fangorn Forest) in this film, and even get a huge battle at the end. Another good Peter Jackson film. Hope the 3rd one is even better."
"May 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,"An incredibly entertaining and involving follow-up that lives up to the first movie, and better yet, even manages to live up to its source material."
"May 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Not as good as the first and third films, mostly because not as much happens in the 3 hours, and the story is told in a less interesting way. 
smeagol appears however, and quickly becomes one of the greatest characters of modern film technologically as well as through his conflict with his inner evil, gollum."
"May 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Another incredible installment in the LOTR series by Peter Jackson. It's hard for me to decide which film is my favorite since all are so entertaining, but I love the Helms Deep battle in this movie so much. It's incredible."
"May 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Definitely an A+ in this film. More action, more orcs and more talent."
"May 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,"pretty good visual interpretation of the book (of which I've been a big fan every since my early teenage years). given the different format, it concentrates more on action, but it's really really well done, and the images are pretty good.  New Zealand-Australia was a perfect find for shooting, and so were some of the actors: the one playing Sam, for example, was a great choice."
"May 13, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Probably the best second movie of a trilogy ever in my opinion and let's face it, it's hard to make a good middle movie!
Andy Serkis is my hero."
"May 13, 2010",NEUTRAL,Its hard to LOVE this film considering how good number one IS and how good number 3 IS...seeing as its in between it just seems like..its..killing time till the third one BUT the reason its good is because IT WORKS its not boring and its STILL got LOTS AND LOTS of great action in it.Definitely a worthy sequel to the firs one
"May 12, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Epic Part 2. This is an important part of the trilgoy, but I have to admit it was not my favorite of the three. So, all in all, this was an effective middle part to the trilogy, but I'm still stuck with the intial discovery and wonder of the Fellowship of the Ring. Also, The Return of the King was an o.k. third part, but FOTR remains my favorite."
"May 11, 2010",NEUTRAL,This trilogy just got better and better!
"May 11, 2010",NEUTRAL,very great epic movie
"May 10, 2010",NEUTRAL,gotta watch all three if you get the chance
"May 10, 2010",NEUTRAL,greatest movie ever.....
"May 10, 2010",NEUTRAL,I couldn't figure out what this movie had to do with getting the ring to Mt. Doom.  That's a really important connection isn't it?  I couldn't figure out what the two towers were either.  I felt like this movie was only for those that had read the book.
"May 9, 2010",NEUTRAL,it could be argued that this is the best of the trilogy. the people who argue this have never seen return of the king.
"May 9, 2010",NEUTRAL,Masterpiece. Enough said.
"May 9, 2010",NEUTRAL,Reminds me of a neighbour I once had.
"May 9, 2010",NEUTRAL,"This movie continues the trilogy started by the Fellowship of the Ring, it is very good and meets the standard set by the first one. However, I felt more bored through a lot of the movie than the first one. This movie basically is three parts that switches every five or ten minutes. There is Merry and Pippen (yawn) who are off with this talking tree called Treebeard. Frodo and Sam continue their long journey and have to trust Gollum to get to Mordor, but not much really happens within their journey. What really saves this movie is the parts with Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. They start off trying to rescue Mary and Pippen and keep going from there. This part really saves the movie, and otherwise, I would have quickly fallen asleep. The soundtrack is still great, everything still looks cool, and there is an awesome battle at the end. The movie is three hours just like the first one, so its defintaly worth watching if you can stay awake through the boring parts"
"May 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,Maybe the most even film of the trilogy. Helm's Deep in particular will blow you away.
"May 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,Strays but is as good as both of the others..
"May 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, or ""Thrillogy"" as I prefer to call it, is beyond doubt seen by so many fantasy fans, myself included as the best book to film adaptation series ever made...

Firstly, the shooting of these films on location in New Zealand was a brilliant decision by Peter Jackson, the beauty and diversity of the brilliant country is second to none in terms of filming locations. 

The acting quality of these 3 movies is near enough faultless, and Jacksons special effects team does a brilliant job making an audience 5-10 years after they were made think ""wow I saw a film a week ago with worse special effects!"" The sight of the Riders of Rohan charging towards Minas Tirith is a sight to behold even 7 years after the films theatrical release.

These films deserve all the interest they get in the early noughties and need to be remembered for years to come as some of the best and most captivating films of all time. 

Even the fact that all 3 films were shot before even the first was released shows the confidence that Peter Jackson had that his 3 films were going to go down in history of cinema!

For being nothing below works of priceless art, a 10/10 for all 3 parts of this masterful trilogy!

Jack! Xx"

"May 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,though butt-numingly long this one of the rare sequels that are as good as or better than the ifrst
"May 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Some memorable moments, but for me, no opening, no ending and repetitive sweeping camera scenes, enough time to go to the toilet, have dinner and a shower and still miss nothing. Spectacular yet flawed."
"May 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,This one is my absolute favorite of the triology! I like the trees being apart of the war and handling their business. I loved that Gandalf was still alive and that he whoop butt too in this one. I just appreciated the union.

WELLINGTON REPRESENT!!!!!!!!!!!!! Woo New Zealand =D"
"May 2, 2010",NEUTRAL,The battles in this movie was amazing and got even better and the next two movies.
"May 2, 2010",NEUTRAL,"this is my favorite story of all time, I love the epic journey these characters go on especially Frodo & Sam, this movie is a little slow in the middle compare to the other two movies in the series, but I still love it."
"May 2, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Peter Jackson has always maintained that The Two Towers is ""the second act"" of his epic undertaking, and perhaps the true greatness of the middle chapter will only be clear when viewed in context. As a stand-alone film, however, The Two Towers is not quite as good as Fellowship. (Nor, indeed, does it extend the universe or deepen the relationships in the manner of The Empire Strikes Back.) That it still merits the full five stars is merely an indication of how high the benchmark has been set. Picking up pretty much where Fellowship left off, this is a considerably darker film, with Frodo (Wood) falling further under the influence of the Ring (giving rise to some seriously spooky hallucinations), while Saruman (Christopher Lee) wreaks even more havoc. There's also the first appearance of Saruman's spy, the sinister Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), and the complex Gollum, a brilliant combination of computer trickery and raspy vocals from Andy Serkis (the campaign for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar starts here. t may lack the first-view-thrill and natural dramatic shape of Fellowship, but this is both funnier and darker than the first film, and certainly more action-packed. An essential component of what is now destined to be among the best film franchises of all time"
"Apr 30, 2010",NEUTRAL,moins fidèle au roman que ne l'était le premier
"Apr 30, 2010",NEUTRAL,Best of the LOTR trilogy.
"Apr 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,"I'm totally gay for this movie (and the others in the trilogy), don't JUDGE ME!"
"Apr 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Much less mystical than the first, but by no means is it a lesser film. Two Towers is a more raw, more human, more of desperation and second thinking. The introduction of Gollum lends a great deal of villany and comapnionship, and I still say Anthony Serkis deserved at least a nomination. A great midway in a great trilogy."
"Apr 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,hell to the yea love all three..
"Apr 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,and this..love it too^^
"Apr 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Where can i begin with the film The Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers? Let's begin with a few words; Amazing, Spellbinding, Perfect. The Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers is a perfect movie, visually, acting, dialogue, everything. It is a major improvement from the near-perfect Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. Another great acting ensemble and many oscar worthy acts. The visual effects, like before, are worthy of the oscar that it received. The story line, though based off the book, was phoenomenal. The intense battle scenes kept me on the edge of my seat and the dialogue between the characters kept me interested all the way. And when the ending finally came and the credits began rolling i rushed home and marked my calendar on the day of the release date of the final film. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is, in short for a better word, perfect."
"Apr 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,who would have thought it would start with an epic bang even though it is a middle film. Part continues the journey and doesnt look back with a suspenceful climactic battle.

"Apr 26, 2010",NEUTRAL,Love the series great movies.
"Apr 26, 2010",NEUTRAL,I liked this one better than the first one.  The addition of battle scenes make this movie better in my opinion.  The movie is again long but enjoyable to watch.
"Apr 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,"It may be my least favorite out of both the books and movies, but the film is still practically flawless. It's still awe-inspiring, featuring much more action and fantasy war and much less sentimental monologues than the first film."
"Apr 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,The first one was better
"Apr 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,too many evil army  oh well very cool ! lol
"Apr 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,"to much war, teeth grinding and silly tolkien-ness"
"Apr 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers is somewhat burdened with the most difficult job in the series: that is, to let the series make a transition from the first installment to the last one. Obviously, the second installment in a trilogy is typically the weakest, and as its own film, The Two Towers will probably be another testament to this rule, but at the end of the day, does this really matter? Peter Jackson intended these three films to be one gigantic one, not unlike how Tolkein intended the original books to be one behemoth book. And for what it's supposed to do--that is, to form a bridge between Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King and still be an exciting film in its own right--the film does splendidly. This installment is more episodic than Fellowship (probably because what's left of the broken Fellowship is on their own in little groups now) but this is to the films advantage, as the climax near the end of the film is breathtaking. Whereas the first film was sort of lyrical in its execution, this film is much more of an action-thriller-war film, so the established great performances from the first film (McKellen, Mortensen, and company) don't quite stand out as much. That said, there is one dynamite performance in this film, and that is Andy Serkis's chilling, now-iconic turn as Gollum, the devious hobbit-like creature. It's still well-written, it's still well-directed, it's still well-acted, and it's still technically gorgeous, but it's hard to straight-up enjoy this film as a stand-alone film, since virtually everything in it is an obvious buildup to the third film."
"Apr 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Not better than the ""fellowship"" but still amazing and had the epic factor, really no downside it just wasnt the first, they seem like they changed Directorial directions for the films. Dont watch it with no prior knowledge because it picks up exactly seconds after the first."
"Apr 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,This film is just as memorable and breathtaking as the first one. The weakest of the trilogy but still one of the best films. As the story heats up the films gets better but its still too cgi and just not dark enough.
"Apr 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,My favorite LOTR movie.
"Apr 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,"My favourite trilogy. Not close to the book, but could not be better adapted."
"Apr 23, 2010",NEUTRAL,I found this movie to be quite morning from what I remember... Though I haven't seen this movie in over 6 years so I'm not really sure how great it was.
"Apr 23, 2010",NEUTRAL,BEST FILMS EVER!ESPECIALLY THE BEGINNING
"Apr 23, 2010",NEUTRAL,With the second movie it shows us the vastness of Tolkiens world and those within it that hold bearing to Mr. Baggins. Peter Jackson knows has my respect.
"Apr 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,"In my personal opinion, The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers is the most magical, impressive and visually stunning film in existence. Peter Jackson has succeeded in creating a timeless classic. There are some of you that argue it is overrated, which I think is a travesty. The story of the ring is epic in itself, with the trilogy by J R R Tolkien one of the most well known all around the world. And as The Sunday Times said (and you know you can trust a tabloid newspaper...ahem) ""The English-speaking world is divided into those who have read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings and those who are going to read them."" Peter Jackson has successfully taken this story and created a translation onto screen in so much depth, bringing the story to a whole new generation. 

It is obvious in the viewing of The Lord of the Rings of the painstaking care and love that went into its creation. If I had been given the cast list for The Lord of the Rings, I would have been amazed by how many big stars were on board and would have told you that it wouldn't work. I would have been wrong. Ian McKellen, Andy Serkis, Hugo Weaving, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen etcetera are, in a word, prodigious. Each and every member of the cast offers the perfect portrayl of characters in their mannerisms and identity. In esscence, no one else could have done it better. 

One thing that really struck me about The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers were the battle scenes (which again were brought to life in Return of the King). If I could choose one moment that defines a perfect film experience for me I would say the scene where Gandalf arrives with the Riders of Rohan with the sun rising behind him. It is epic in proportion and none of the emotion is lost in trying to make bloodbath scenes. Jackson was much more subtle and it pays off.

Overall, no matter whether you love it or hate it, The Lord of the Rings trilogy is the pinnacle of modern cinema. As I think The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers is the strongest of the trilogy, surely it is THE best film in existence?"
"Apr 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Usually in these types of Sagas the Sequel is the best! (example Empire), however that is not the case with this saga,but this is still a great film!"
"Apr 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,"An other great movie... If you have read my critic of the fellowship of the ring well, it's the same thing. The visual effect are as good as the other movie and it's the same thing for the story. It's really hard for a director to fallow the story of a book without forgetting things. Well done Jackson!

History: 5/5 Movie: 4/5  Total: 9/10

Un autre super film. Si vous avez lu ma critique pour la communauté de l'anneau et bien c'est la même chose... Les effets visuel sont toujours aussi bon et c'est la même chose pour l'histoire. C,est très difficile pour un réalisateur de suivre l'histoire d'un livre sans oublier des détails important, Bon travail Jackson!"
"Apr 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,Sekuel II of the great movie of Tolkien's masterpiece LOTR
"Apr 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,An excellent epic movie that is breath-taking and beautifully directed.
"Apr 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,"All three of these movies are incredible.  Peter Jackson drained every bit of his awesome movie directing life force into them; they're all pretty much one big movie.  I wish the studio would re-release them in theaters.  They're beautiful, sweeping, epic films and they belong on the big screen."
"Apr 21, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Not as good as the first one, but still epic"

1000% love it"
"Apr 19, 2010",NEUTRAL,This had some amazing action sequences and was vastly superior to the first one. The side characters take more of a spotlight here.
"Apr 19, 2010",NEUTRAL,Orlando Bloom....I think that about covers it.
"Apr 19, 2010",NEUTRAL,superb....love it. This film is just as memorable and breathtaking as the first one.  A brilliantly conceived adventure that has the capacity to take your breath away. A thrilling work of film craft. amazing. The greatest achievement in this film was the epic Battle at Helms Deep. This is hands down the greatest fantasy battle scene in cinematic history. It was dark and gritty... you could literally feel the fear those brave fighters felt. It was inspiring and one of the most heroic moments in the entire saga. outstanding.
"Apr 18, 2010",NEUTRAL,"I like more than ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" but neither won the Oscar for best picture."
"Apr 18, 2010",NEUTRAL,Continuation of the fellowship. Amazing effects and fantastic perfomances from all actors
"Apr 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,"I like the Lord of the Rings movies, but they're soooooo long and dragged out, it gets on my nerves."
"Apr 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,All 3 films are amazing
"Apr 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.

As stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.

As assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.

As was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm's Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm's Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix's 'Bullet Time.' The battle of Helm's Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm's Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers' final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.

In The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore's score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don't think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf's passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner's Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'A-list' composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the 'A-list,' right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.

If not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers."
"Apr 16, 2010",NEUTRAL,"4.5: This is my review of the trilogy as a whole: Can you imagine how fascinating it would have been to have a pint of cider with J.R.R. Tolkien?  That certainly would have been something.  I can think of  few other people throughout history I'd rather sit down with (Jesus, Odysseus, Moses, Cleopatra, Buddha, Elizabeth, etc being other options).  I used to read The Lord of the Rings novels every year when I was younger, but I haven't read a word since prior to seeing this film my freshman year just south of Columbia University at the nearest theater on Broadway.  I went to each of the three films just before either heading back to Minnesota, departing for the United Kingdom, or hopping over to France for my winter vacation.  It was a great way to end the first semester every year and I definitely remember missing it my senior year when the fourth film in the trilogy failed to arrive for the holiday season.  Due to the fact that it has been so long since I've read the books, it is easier for me to view the films as films, instead of as adaptations of the novel.  I, of course, can't entirely divorce the two experiences and I still long to see certain scenes.  Some of the scenes I longed to see this time around were actually in the extended version.  I'll have to buy that when it comes out on Blu-Ray as well.  The film doesn't look spectacular on Blu-Ray when compared to some of the more pristine newer releases, but it still blows DVD away of course.  The fact that I read the novels so many times at such a young age means that they will be forever tied to a certain time and place.  They'll always hold a special place in my heart and psyche.  Thus, the films will never compete for my affections in precisely the same way.  I do love the films though.  They are spectacularly entertaining and spectacularly good.  The only feature film trilogies that immediately come to mind that can compare are Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy and the original Star War's trilogy.  There are television series, such as Band of Brothers or my favorite televisions shows, and film series longer than a trilogy, such as the Up series, that compare, but very few.  The production design, costumes, makeup, digital effects, locations, sets/props, etc are all superb.  New Zealand does really seem to have been the perfect location for the trilogy.  The casting is quite exceptional as well.  I had minor qualms initially, some of which linger, but I've grown to accept just about everyone in their roles (I still hate Celeborn though).   Gollum/Andy Serkis's performance is particularly powerful.  I really think it was worthy of an Academy Award.  The pacing of each of the films is superb.  The films don't lag for a second.  Each scene is absolutely riveting and essential for me.  I can think of few areas where the script could have been improved.  The places where it strays too far from the text of the Lord of the Rings and begins to incorporate elements of The Silmarillion are some of the weaker sections, but some of these also give the film an even greater hinted at depth.  Each act, each scene, each film simply leaves me wanting more.  The third film is almost impossibly brilliant.  I can't think of another picture out there, to include all of my favorite films, that I'd be more apprehensive about seeing with a significant other.  There is no other film that leaves me as emotionally naked.  I can't help but oozing tears and bearing my soul, to some extent at least.  The third act, in particular the last 15 minutes or so, is magnificent.  It doesn't get much better.  Few filmmakers have the guts to drag a film on like this.  Normally I feel like filmmakers put off the ending in order to arrive at some sort of resolution.  This is the opposite.  Jackson and company delay the resolution as long as possible, and thereby comply with the books demands.  It is close to perfection.  I can't wait for the extended versions on Blu-Ray.  Amazing, in every sense of the word.  It does make me wonder what other filmmakers would have made of it.  I am intensely curious about Del Toro's take on the world."
"Apr 16, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers continues Peter Jackson's epic trilogy, with us knowing that the adventure is almost over, but us not knowing how. The Two Towers is an amazing film and wonderfully continues the story, picking up from the previous film. Peter Jackson has already proved that he is a master storyteller and this film works perfectly. The music is still grand, the acting is terrific and the cinematography is beautiful, the final battle at Helm's Deep is probably the film's best part, while Andy Serkis delivers an incredible supporting performance as Gollum. Toward the end, we wonder how everything will get completed and how the whole story will come to an end."
"Apr 16, 2010",NEUTRAL,Gollum and the scale.
"Apr 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Even more visually stunning than the first film, Two Towers soars.  It left me on the edge of my seat for the full duration of the movie.  Brilliant."

"Apr 11, 2010",NEUTRAL,Great film but a few too many liberties taken with the source material in this one... Have to watch the extended cut though or several of the major scenes don't really make a lot of sense.
"Apr 11, 2010",NEUTRAL,"bad bad bad.  I actually slept during the Helm's Depp (?) battle.  C'mon lah, run run run, hack hack hack (show fiery eye) ... yuck!"
"Apr 10, 2010",NEUTRAL,The best of the LOTR trilogy
"Apr 10, 2010",NEUTRAL,"This is actually my favorite film of the trilogy. It by far deserved the oscar for best picture over Chicago, In my opinion at least. This may be the only film that is purly fast paced and completely captivating. I am particularly fond of this film because of the epic war scenes, which brings out far more intensity than the previous film. This is the only Lord of the rings film I am able to watch several times. So what makes this film so appealing and well made?
The Story and Plot: Fascinating how all this could have been dreamed up and created in the form of a book, than captured on film. The attention to detail Jackson has is undoubtably one of the most committed of all time, espicially here. It is in this film we are introduced to Gollum, one of the more interesting characters on the entire story. He sets an aura for the majority of the film, keeping us on the edge of our seats, wondering what he is capable of and what he will actually do. The characters of Sam and Frodo grow far more interesting as their will and abilities are put to the test. Once again it is the war scenes that really push this films through and astound me and keep me glued to the T.V.
The acting: The acting in this film is much the same as the last, with a few exceptions. Viggo Mortenson really pulls through and demonstrates  the ruthless and sensitive side of Aragon, this for me was the standout of the entire film. Wood and Austin really show their grit and talent as their characters are strained and tested. The share size of the cast is also astonishing, once again the attention to detail in the casting and extras is masterful.
A final note is the dazzeling effects. The costumes are perfectly made and a wonder to the eyes. 
Overall this is without a doubt the best of the entire trilogy. I recommend this to every movie lover and anyone who enjoys the epics or fantasy stories."

"Apr 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Actually, I can't fairly judge this movie. Considering I was asleep half the time. Hmm...let's see. Two Towers...Two Stars."
"Apr 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The second installment in the trilogy of the adapted tales from J.R.R. Tolkien picks up exactly where The Fellowship Of The Ring left off, where we see the hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue there journey to the depths Mordor in their mission to destroy the ring, whilst there departed companions make new allies and forge an assault on Isengard. Undeniably separated, Aragon (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) desperately search to find the missing hobbits, who are captured by the Orcs. Meanwhile Gandalf (Ian McKellen) travels in an attempt to locate help, for the engaging battle that soon followed. Director Peter Jackson does deliver a excellent offering for a sequel, though it falls a twinge short of the felllowship. The screenwriting team did manipulate some major storylines from the novels, though the many differences never reflected in this enterprising endeavor. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards and won best sound effects and editing. The visual effects team did another fantastic job, as they created more engaging battle sequences and the introduction of the CGI character, Gollum. Despite the manipulated plot, The Two Towers is still a very entertaining film, filled lots of action and stunning visual and sound effects.

"Apr 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,"This film may only give part of the payoff for the set-up in The Fellowship of the Ring, but boy, is it sweet. Peter Jackson delivers something in The Two Towers that improves it greatly from the first film, and it is represented by two things. One is the CGI Gollum, who is the most chilling character in the film, but also provides much of the comic relief. The other is the awesomely epic Battle of Helm's Deep. This battle redefined the epic scope of the trilogy, and was one of the greatest battles in the history of film. However, this film is highly confusing at times, and often crams way too many characters into one scene. You MUST watch Fellowship of the Ring first. The extended cut, on the other hand, does much more for me than the theatrical version, as it not only gives us a funeral scene for Ãowyn's brother ThÃ (C)odred, it also gives us an excellent flashback to Gondor. This flashback gives us more Sean Bean as Boromir (and who didn't want that?), and gives us our first look at John Noble as Denethor, Boromir and Faramir's sinister father, who plays poor Faramir against his older brother, whom he favors. As for other performances, Ian McKellen still excels as Gandalf, though the mystic nature of the White character makes me somewhat miss the simple kindheartedness of the original Grey. Christopher Lee continues to play villains spectacularly as the evil white wizard Saruman, and Elijah Wood and Sean Astin give it their all as a Frodo and Sam in great peril. Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd are given more to do in this installment, providing both humor and drama as Merry and Pippin (especially in the extended scenes with the Orcs). Hugo Weaving, Liv Tyler, and Cate Blanchett provide a mystic presence in their respective characters of Elrond, Arwen, and Galadriel, and trilogy newcomer David Wenham, Miranda Otto, Bernard Hill, Brad Dourif, and Karl Urban all provide great performances as Faramir, Ãowyn, ThÃ (C)oden, Grima Wormtongue, and Ãomer, respectively. But as stated above, Andy Serkis truly is the best actor in this film, even in motion capture. His Gollum is compelling, fascinating, comedic, and frightening all rolled into one, and shows what could happen to any poor soul corrupted by the power of the RIng. After the expository nature of The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers ups the stakes, moving the film trilogy one step closer to its epic conclusion."
"Mar 21, 2010",NEUTRAL,"my favorite quote of this movie is when Legolas hits the dead orc and says""it moved"" and Gimil said""thats because my axe is in his nervous system"" lol"
"Mar 20, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The Two towers is the greatest ""middle"" of any films series ever."
"Mar 20, 2010",NEUTRAL,The trilogy that keeps on giving
"Mar 19, 2010",NEUTRAL,couldnt wait for this one.and couldnt wait for the next
"Mar 18, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The entire trilogy is remarkable.

The battle for Helms Deep was a 40+ minute battle of greatness.  

Excellent movie."
"Mar 18, 2010",NEUTRAL,Excellant story line contined. Great movie
"Mar 18, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic film, in my opinion the best of the trilogy due to the elongated ending in Return of the King. Jackson has produced an epic film with special effects that are second to none, not even Avatar."
"Mar 18, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Again, extended version prefered."
"Mar 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,havent seen it in forver
"Mar 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,Top of the list - definately!
"Mar 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,"best one of the three, like the book, amazing movie"
"Mar 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Incredible, it does not get worse one bit because it is a sequel!"
"Mar 16, 2010",NEUTRAL,Five Star for the extended Directors cut version only. There was so much info/detail lost from the theater version.
"Mar 16, 2010",NEUTRAL,these movies are really confusing
"Mar 16, 2010",NEUTRAL,Best one of the three.
"Mar 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,"LOTR is simply, the best. All three of them."
"Mar 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Jatkuu suoraan siitÃ¤ mihin Sormusten ritarit jÃ¤i.

"Mar 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,algo lenta  pero al final  buena
"Mar 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,The best from the trilogy...
"Mar 13, 2010",NEUTRAL,Anyone who knows me knows what I'm rating this movie
"Mar 12, 2010",NEUTRAL,The story continues consistently and stronger.
"Mar 11, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Like the book, one of those in-between things that you just gotta read and see"
"Mar 11, 2010",NEUTRAL,The special effects blew my mind when i saw this at the cinema. Pretty good.
"Mar 11, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Ini dah mulai perang, perangnya seru!!"
"Mar 10, 2010",NEUTRAL,"yeah, whatever, good movie, books are better....READ!!!!!"
"Mar 10, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Ez a film tipikusan olyan hogy nagysikeru volt , de mar unalmas"
"Mar 9, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Since this one picked up right where Fellowship of the Ring left off, it's a really improvement. We get to know the characters more, we get deeper in the story, we get to see some great action scenes and we get introduced to Gollum.

It still suffers from the fact that, like Fellowship of he Ring, it ends on a cliff hanger, but just like this one, Return of the King came out the following year"
"Mar 9, 2010",NEUTRAL,"the weakest of the three, but still THE SHIT!!!!!!"
"Mar 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,"honestly, all the lotr movies blend together in my head, so i can't remember how good they were individually."
"Mar 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,This trilogy is one of the greatest accomplishments in the film industry to date. I genuinely feel for the characters portrayed in the film. The Siege of Helm's Deep is a spectacle to behold.
"Mar 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,"""I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. Go back to the shadow. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun! You shall not pass!""
This is where the trilogy really starts to get meaty, we meet all the real big players, Gollum's tragedy becomes clear and heart-breaking and the action starts to heat up. Beautiful, vast visuals accompany convincing performances and make for an excellent second act of one of the finest trilogies of all time."
"Mar 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,"I could go on forever. They managed to take the most difficult of the three books and straighten it out into a single time line. Beautiful, brilliant, touching and Serkis is a genius."
"Mar 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,"This movie shows bravery and how different types and groups of people can work together or against one another.  More than anything, I enjoyed Merry and Pippen who experienced life the same whether in the shire or in the middle of an international dispute."
"Mar 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,wish more movies were made this good. it's Longshot approved!
"Mar 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,it was a bit too long for me but still very good xx
"Mar 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,Helm's Deep is the best battle scene I think I have seen.  Lot's of great orc dialogue and the music is amazing.  I think it's my favorite of the trilogy.
"Mar 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,Best of the Lord of the Rings movies.
"Mar 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,Gollum and final battle sequence are extraordinary.  Almost as perfect as the first.
"Mar 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Karl Urban, oh yeah!"
"Mar 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Is Aragorn some kind of god? Gods need no sympathy, neither do godlike female elves. They made the books seem worse."
"Mar 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The weakest of the trilogy, but still an amazing film in its own right.  It's like the Lamborghini sitting next to the Ferrari and the Aston Martin.  It might be your 3rd favorite, but it still beats the crap out of most other cars on the road."
"Mar 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,The best sequel ever made. Better than Godfather's sequel. A sequel to best Fantasy movie ever made.
"Mar 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Again, amazing filmmaking. Not as many memorable moments as the other two, but still very enjoyable and engaging."
"Mar 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,absolutely fantastic. i dont need to say much more.
"Mar 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,A wild thrill ride and an excellent combination of high fantasy and epic battles and a struggle between good and evil. The Two Towers is the most memorable of the trilogy.
"Mar 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,a hidden gem if you watch the extended edition
"Mar 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,same as the first; brilliant.
"Mar 2, 2010",NEUTRAL,"OK, maybe this movie is great but I don't think so
I watched it on TV but the advertisements on TV really that many and I went sleepy every time I watched it so I haven't watched it until finished
But I admit that the story is good and the sudden appearance of Gandalf the White surprised me!
The setting of Mordor is really cool!"
"Mar 1, 2010",NEUTRAL,"I hadn't seen this for a while, but it was fantastic!  First of all, I'm madly in love with Viggo Mortensen.  Second, I found it HILARIOUS when Legolas skateboarded down steps using a shield.  This movie is more violent than the others, but I still like it a lot!"
"Mar 1, 2010",NEUTRAL,A fantastic sequel that continues the brilliance of the first one. It also officially introduces the deceitful but strangely tragic Gollum.
"Mar 1, 2010",NEUTRAL,"full action,,,!!!!i like this,,,,"
"Feb 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Magnificent,especially the extended version"
"Feb 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,I love the battle scenes
"Feb 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Probably my least favorite out of the three, but still a decent film."
"Feb 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,Yes they were long..but I did enjoy watching this...
"Feb 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,a bit lousy compared to other two
"Feb 26, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Nearly perfect in just about everything, it's my favorite of the 3 just because of how every story is fragmented from the fellowship, yet still so closely connected. Each story creates a sense of empathetic rapport with the audience. Though there are warriors present, everyone seems to have a vulnerability that we all can relate to. Action sequences are wonderful, and all the costumes and dialogue are spot on. Awesome Mr. Jackson."
"Feb 26, 2010",NEUTRAL,Just as stunning as the first movie with the addition of even more characters that I ended up loving. Waiting another year for the conclusion of the story was painful after this.
"Feb 26, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Another excellent film.  I am rewatching the trilogy with my fiancee who is seeing them for the first time and she is loving them!!  It's fun to watch, full of excitement and excellent story.  Look out Return of the King, here we come.

Sorry, I know its not much of a review!"
"Feb 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Esta movie obtuvo once nominaciones al Oscar en el 2003 y gano las once. Esta pelicula junto con Titanic (1997)  y Ben-Hur (1959) son las tres movie ganadoras de once premios al Oscar, en su respectivos a~no."
"Feb 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,"OBVIOUSLY had two towers never come to be a live action epic, 300 & the SWARM of sword  & bow war movies (TROY, Kingdom of Heaven ETC.) would most likely never have come to pass. Thank you Peter Jackson says every movie trying to cash in on this films success."
"Feb 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,"pretty awsome, almost makes me want to read the books."
"Feb 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,this was my favorite of the 3
"Feb 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,"This movie is absolutely awesome. I don't feel that it should have won Best Picture like the first one should have and the third one did (it should have gone to The Pianist instead of Chicago) but I still lived this movie. I particularly liked the battle for Helm's Deep. also the Warg fight (where legolas does that cool horse trick) is good too. I also love that this is the movie that introduces the character of Gollum/Smeagol fully. In the first one he was more of a shadowy figure that Gandalf talked about to Frodo for 2 minutes. in this one he is his own awesome character. the special effects, set and costumes are pretty much the same through the three movies and they are amazing."
"Feb 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,Good but monotonous!
"Feb 23, 2010",NEUTRAL,ANYTHING BY J.R. TOLKEN IS GOOD
"Feb 23, 2010",NEUTRAL,see the first one (yes sir )
"Feb 23, 2010",NEUTRAL,there was applause in the theater haha.
"Feb 23, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Best for action, probably as good as The Fellowship of the Rjing.  Ents are badass, Treebeard is way older than pretty much every other entity in Middle Earth, but could have been better if they threw in the part in the book where Saruman has a good long conversation before disappearing from the story altogether."
"Feb 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,"This movie may start off quite slowly, but it gradually paces with great adventure and one of the greatest battles I've ever seen on screen."
"Feb 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Don't harm the PRECIOUS haha golem is funny..whew there is alot to say about this movie but I'm just going to sum it down to one word.....""phenomenal"""
"Feb 21, 2010",NEUTRAL,Could be the best trilogy ever...star wars ruined itself..
"Feb 20, 2010",NEUTRAL,LOVED ALL LORD OF THE RING'S!!!!
"Feb 20, 2010",NEUTRAL,Better than the first. I love this movie
"Feb 20, 2010",NEUTRAL,Excellent movie can't wait for the Hobbit
"Feb 20, 2010",NEUTRAL,"It's hard to rate this movie, as well as it's predecessor The Fellowship of the Ring, and it's sequel Return of the King, as seperate entities. The entire thrill of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy was that it stood as a cohesive and complete movie spaced out over the span of three seperate films. As such, I have posted the same review for all three movies in the series with minor changes concerning plots near the end. All three of these movies are filled with a vibrancy of the sort that is rarely seen in films of any type, let alone a fantasy epic. The attention to detail and the obvious care of the source material stands out in every part of Jackson's trilogy masterpiece. This is more than a movie, it is a work of loving respect by a man who understood what it meant to be able to lose yourself for even a short time in the mystical world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth. Everything about these movies is of the highest standards. The acting is believable, (which is amazing considering that they were expected to make us believe in wizards and elves), and moreso the acting is honest. There is no attempts to carry things overly dramatic or to seek a spotlight above the others. These are roles that are fun to watch and instantly create a bond of caring between viewer and actor. The plot, is of course, based upon one of the greatest selling series of books of all time. As expected it is thrilling, heroic, tragic, chilling, suspenseful, as well as action-packed. The direction is spot-on, and the filmwork itself is beautiful. Everything about these three movies is of the highest calibre, and make for one of the defining series of filmmaking for this generation.
*Potential Spoiler Alert*
The action picks up immediately from the end of The Fellowship of the Ring and does not slow down for the entire length of the picture.  The development of the characters continues, with elements of the friendships between characters now allowing for inside laughs that the audience can enjoy as well.  These are no longer a group of strangers, they are a group of friends that the audience has come to know just as well as they have.
The introduction of the Smeagol/Gollum character, and the job done in bringing him to life is absolutely stunning.  Andy Serkis is absolutely genius in his portrayal of a character so tragic that you cannot help but become entralled with him.  The true magic is that you begin to cease seeing the character as a special effect and begin to see him as a real person inhabiting this movie.  Brilliant.
Little can be said about the awesome spectacle that is the climactic battle at the end of this movie that has not already been said before.  It is an awe inspiring scene of such fluid pacing, yet startling vividness and grandeur that you cannot help but be impressed by it."
"Feb 19, 2010",NEUTRAL,DVD Deluxe Edition Boxed Set
"Feb 19, 2010",NEUTRAL,Great middle erth action & story with scenery to match.
"Feb 19, 2010",NEUTRAL,The best of the trilogy..
"Feb 19, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The film that holds the entire trilogy together, featuring its breathtaking final battle at Helm's Deep. 9/10"
"Feb 18, 2010",NEUTRAL,amazing cinematic experience
"Feb 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,"This is actually my favorite one out of the trilogy. In one of the final battle scenes of this movie, I was taken away by Gandolf the White and his horse as they came down the large hill."
"Feb 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,Terrific ensemble performance!
"Feb 16, 2010",NEUTRAL,Would be 5 star too if not for Legolas' gaybo shield-surfing antics at Helm's Deep. Yes Im a hard man to please...
"Feb 16, 2010",NEUTRAL,"My favourite of the series. I cannot complain about anything contained within this movie. Its long so you better be in the movie wating mood when you begin. The quality of the battle at Helm's Deep is completly unparallel to anything before or since. The more internal story line as we follow Frodo and Sam's progress is of the highest quality. However probably my favourite part of the whole movie is the dialogue, it never crosses the line from epic to corny, it has a modern feel to it without ever taking us out of Middle Earth and quite frankly it occasionally gives me goose bumps."
"Feb 16, 2010",NEUTRAL,"I have all 3, GREAT movies"
"Feb 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,May not be quite as good as Fellowship but still a great movie.
"Feb 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,"wow..what a budget,n stories..
two thumbs up for Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), and Aragorn (Hugo W), but is there any private relationship between Frodo and Sam? they are more than close, i think"
"Feb 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Everything I faulted the first movie for seems to have been corrected in The Two Towers. Gandalf's lighthearted moments were subtle, not goofy. Elijah Wood was better, in some unquantifiable way. Viggo Mortensen looks even better as Aragorn when he's haggard and tired. This movie also does a great job of capturing the friendship/rivalry between Legolas and Gimli, which is one of my favorite aspects of the books.

I neglected to mention the creature effects in the Fellowship review, so I'll hit on them now. In Fellowship, I thought the orcs and goblins looked terrible, pretty much on-par with the ooze creatures in the Power Rangers movie. They look a lot better in Two Towers. The Ents look a little wonky, something about their eyes. But I have to say, Gollum looks fantastic. I can't think of anything that they could improve.

And I guess the music was good. I didn't really pay attention. :P"
"Feb 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,The story continues... love it!
"Feb 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The follow-up to the smashing Fellowship. A sequel is rarely better than its prequel and Two Towers is no exeption, but that doesn't mean that it is bad. Quite the contrary."
"Feb 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Great movie of all time, hands down!!!"
"Feb 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,all the movies are visually stunning and are fun to watch
"Feb 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,My Favo Movie !!! Love it so much !!!
"Feb 13, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Superb!  The taming of Smeagol and the Battle at Helms Deep -- This was a great movie.
If Peter Jackson would have made Gollum/Smeagol any less than what Andy Serkus put into him, the movie would be a flop.  The Schizophrenic argument between Smeagol and Gollum was magnificant.  The grittiness and shear grandeur of the Battle at Helms Deep was beyond anything ever accomplished."
"Feb 13, 2010",NEUTRAL,"this was my favorite of the three.  so many good things about it!!  especially how everyones fighting with swords n mallots, n the elf guy is using bow and arrows n he's kicking ass!!"
"Feb 12, 2010",NEUTRAL,Impressive battle scenes.
"Feb 12, 2010",NEUTRAL,The second in the trilogy
"Feb 11, 2010",NEUTRAL,Spectacular preformance! Awesome effects and mind-bending war scenes.
"Feb 10, 2010",NEUTRAL,"it is the triologia of movies but good that and seen
thanks to all those that made those movies are a delight to the eyes"
"Feb 9, 2010",NEUTRAL,"All 3 episodes of Lord of the Rings are excellent.  The filming, the acting, the storyline, everything is really top form but for me its a thinking movie, a long thinking movie at that & generally I'm a simplistic girl."
"Feb 9, 2010",NEUTRAL,The Two Towers  continues to break new ground with visual effects and additional characters.
"Feb 9, 2010",NEUTRAL,Love it! one of my FAVs. own it
"Feb 9, 2010",NEUTRAL,Excellent film to a promising and entertaining trilogy
"Feb 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,Though I actually liked the first movie I didn't like this at all. It was boring and the story got more complicated for viewers who haven't read the book. I didn't care for the shift in focus to war scenes. Watching this was torture in a lot of ways. (First viewing - December 2002 in theaters)
"Feb 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Really, I should probably let this film soak in a bit; I am, after all, on something of a ""post-viewing"" high right now. However, at this moment, my feeling remains the same from the first installment - this is the movie experience I've been waiting my whole life for. In case you haven't gathered, this movie is visually stunning, literally breathtaking. I mean that, some of the scenes in this film simply stopped my lungs in their tracks, shocked at the pure, enveloping beauty of the shot. Peter Jackson has a profound grasp of visual manipulation like few directors have ever had.

The acting is, as always, superb. Specific mention goes to both John Rhys-Davies in his well enjoyed comic turn, and very largely to Andy Serkis, who was a major role in creating the most realistic and brilliantly well-performed CGI character I've ever seen (Gollum).

For the most part, and as a fan of the books, I take no offense to the slight plot modifications. My understanding is that Tolkien himself realized that visual adaptation of LotR would require a somewhat different take on his work, and was apparently open to such minute changes. 

In short, if you found the continual enjoyment I did with the first movie of LotR, this movie will in no way let you down. Not even for a minute."
"Feb 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,Not as strong as the first film. It lacks the emotional focus but still remains a truly inspired piece of art. The film feels a bit drawn out at spots. But the final battles more than make up for its pacing in its first half. And most of the reason for it not being as successful as in most parts of a planned trilogy is that the first one was just incredible and so hard to measure up to. And it's the middle chapter leading up to all the upcoming incredible events of the next chapter.
"Feb 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,This is officially one of the most tedious films I have ever been forced to watch in my life.
"Feb 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,See it.it's really good.
"Feb 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,It was an intresting and I Loved it!
"Feb 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,"A lot better than the first one, but I still don't like"
"Feb 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Easily the weakest film in the trilogy. It really grinds my gears that so few other people realise what a borderline catastrophe this was. It's kind of just a dumb action movie, the plot doesn't move forward, and Gollum really isn't that funny, fuck you."
"Feb 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,its  so good its hard to explain go choke on a fart
"Feb 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,the best movies....!!!!! lot 0f adventure...b0ut frenzship...n sacrifice..
"Feb 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,the cinematography is spectacular!
"Feb 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,An amazing movie. You'd have to watch it to appreciate it.
"Feb 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Mmm, mixed feelings about these movies."
"Feb 2, 2010",NEUTRAL,This is good movie but it loses points for a long long ending.
"Feb 2, 2010",NEUTRAL,"1star the Direction of pgotography, 2 stars te movie... not good to me... but if you're a Tolkien Fan... well"
"Feb 2, 2010",NEUTRAL,"seru g film'y?
lum liat ceah.."
"Feb 2, 2010",NEUTRAL,simply the most well made film of all time even if your not keen on this genre of film
"Feb 1, 2010",NEUTRAL,The most entertaining movie experience you will ever have.
"Feb 1, 2010",NEUTRAL,For me the Two Towers slumps just a tiny tiny bit. But dont get me wrong it is still absolutly astonishing. This one turns the heat up or steps up to the next level. Jackson really understands this world and the peoples that live in it. This one has a little bit more action and the final battle was great. It kept you on the edge of your seat and made you want even more.
"Feb 1, 2010",NEUTRAL,"When I saw this movie, I was like a nodding dog, obviously Peter Jackson's interpretation  of the greatest trilogy ever written surpassed even my expectations. Can't wait for The Hobbit!!"
"Jan 31, 2010",NEUTRAL,"the best of the LOTR trilogy, with an amazing performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum. Forth, Eorlingas!"
"Jan 31, 2010",NEUTRAL,Very Good movie with a very nice story. Good characters and acting. Nice action and special effects.
"Jan 31, 2010",NEUTRAL,Really intense and filled with suspense had me sitting at the edge of my seat the whole time
"Jan 30, 2010",NEUTRAL,My favorite LOTR movie.
"Jan 30, 2010",NEUTRAL,it was not my favorite of the trilogy but i loved it!
"Jan 30, 2010",NEUTRAL,"well made movie, great series too!"
"Jan 29, 2010",NEUTRAL,"incredible battle most fav quote ""the battle of helms deep is over and the battle for middle earth is about to begin"" Gandalf the white"
"Jan 29, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Epic part 2 to the trilogy, again get the extended version."
"Jan 29, 2010",NEUTRAL,Orland Bloom is hot!!!
"Jan 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,FAVORITE OF ALL 3!!!!
"Jan 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,keep walking and talking
"Jan 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Everything I said about the first I can keep about this one so there not much to say. If you liked the first there's no way you're not gonna like this one and there's no way you're gonna miss it. It keeps epic, beautifull and a catch to the eye. Peter Jackson created one of the best movie series ever and should get the director of the decade for it."
"Jan 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The first entry in Peter Jackson's film adaptation of ""The Lord of the Rings"" was so perfectly plotted and engaging the films that follow almost feel weaker in comparison.  The film-maker's task with the middle segment of the trilogy is certainly rife with more challenges.  With the breaking of the Fellowship at the end of the first film we're now asked to follow three separate stories.  Frodo and Sam continue their journey to Mordor to try and slam-dunk the One Ring into Mount Doom with the aid of the sneaky Gollum,  Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli attempt to rally the kingdom of Rohan to battle against Sauron which culminates with the siege of Helm's Deep, whilst Merry and Pippin escape the clutches of their orc captors and encounter Treebeard the Ent whom they hope will take the fight to Saruman in Isengard.  Whoooof!!!  Well, this wouldn't be too bad if Jackson didn't engage in some bizarre choices which actually LENGTHEN an already cumbersome plot.  The character of Faramir has always been the antithesis of his brother Boromir but here screenwriters Fran Walsh
Philippa Boyens make him just as obsessed as his brother to exploit the power of the One Ring.  So, we're ""treated"" to a painful (not to mention expensive-looking) detour as Faramir drags the hobbits back to Osgiliath.  The first time I saw this I was pretty pissed, but the so-called ""Extended Edition"" which was subsequently released, makes this more palatable by interspersing some flashbacks of Faramir being swayed by the impossibly strict wishes of his father Denethor.  In fact, if the movie suffers from anything, it's the dearth of flashbacks.  For example, Liv's Tyler's already freestyle role as Arwen is pulled through the thread of ""Two Towers"" like a lengthy splinter. I'm sure she was injected into the films merely to flesh out more of the female roles, which I agree with in theory.  But the scenes between her and Aragorn which were omitted from the first film are now shoe-horned into this central chapter in the form of flashbacks, increasing the scattershot effects of the narrative.  Jackson also telegraphs the whole concept of the kingdom of men coming into their own age of independence by having the elves intervene in the final battle.  All is not dire, however.  There is lots to admire in this film and Jackson certainly gets more right than wrong in this massive undertaking.  Gollum, for example, is certainly one of the most memorable and full-blooded CGI characters in cinema history.  Having Andy Serkis in a motion capture suit on set to interact with Elijah Wood and  Sean Astin was something I wish George Lucas would adopt.  Speaking of our favorite evil-ring couriers, the depth of Frodo and Sam's relationship deepens and you really get the sense that Sam's insistence in accompanying Frodo at the end of ""Fellowship"" is perhaps the most pivotal moment in the entire trilogy.  Frankly, I also think it's great that Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan get their own segment with the Ents, driving home the point that two characters so small in stature can have a major impact on the story.  In the human camp, David Wenham is great new addition, as if he actually were related to Sean Bean's Boromir from the first film.  He strikes an intense but honorable air as Faramir and certainly comes into his own in ""Return of the King.""   The people of Edoras are also well represented.  Karl Urban, before his triumphant turn as Dr. McCoy in the recent ""Star Trek"" reboot is commanding and authoritative as Eomer.  Veteran actor Bernard Hill is equally fantastic as King Theoden, literally coming to life before your eyes to rally his people to war.  Speaking of one of numerous devils in the trilogy, Brad Dourif is appropriately slimy as ear-poisoner to the king Grima Wormtongue.  Finally the angelic Miranda Otto is hypnotic as Eowyn, making me ponder Aragorn's curious headspace as he keeps pining for the sniffly-looking Arwen.  The film culminates with an epic battle at Helm's Deep which also ends up being a bit of a mixed bag.  When Jackson pulls the camera back we get plenty of spectacle but when he closes in on the frantic melee action quite often he resorts to blurry close-up or, much worse, inexplicable slow-motion shots.  A certain staff-wielding wizard also makes a timely re-appearance (his return spoiled somewhat by yet another flashback) at the tail end of the battle just in time to pre-sage ""The battle for Helm's Deep is over. The battle for Middle-Earth is about to begin"".   But, once again, this is a tale for another telling...  Tilt: up."
"Jan 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Easily, the best in the series."
"Jan 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,Loved all 3 LOTR movies.
"Jan 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,I think this one was my favourite.
"Jan 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,great dramatical story
"Jan 26, 2010",NEUTRAL,Helms Deep was just an Epic battle.
"Jan 26, 2010",NEUTRAL,"so this is my second favorite of the franchise. its pretty epic, cool and creative. i have nothing much to say about this film. all i have to say about this film is that its awesome."
"Jan 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,excellent only that I can say best of the best.
"Jan 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,"More action more adventure and less stealth.
Loved watching it."
"Jan 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,"One of the best fantasy films ever made, a gripping tale of middle earth but still frodo is back to his damsel is distress role, the helms deep battle was great action sequence, this film creates an great  involvement with the audience with a group of characters they care about this is done brillantly, an great sequal in a trilogoy"
"Jan 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,"After reading all of Tolkien's works, and watching each of these movies, The Two Towers strikes me as being the best as well as the most powerfully awe inspiring of the three movies (that exist as of now, the Hobbit being the next) It is the Empire Strikes Back of Lord of the Rings, it ties up loose ends and opens new doors, as any good part 2 of a trilogy should be."
"Jan 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Have you been searching for a film that is worth your time and money? Look no further. There are only a handful of films that I would label amazing, and this second installment in the thrilling Lord of the Rings trilogy is definitely one of them. I wasn't sure if this film could top its predecessor, The Fellowship of the Ring, and it didn't. But it was a very close call. The Two Towers is one of those rare sequels that rivals its predecessor in quality. But that's just it. This movie is a rarity. At the moment, I can't think of a better movie, save for The Return of the King. But that movie simply can't be topped. But The Two Towers hold its own, and that is quite a feat. It is a direct continuation of The Fellowship of the Ring, picking up right after its climax. I had not read the books when I first saw this movie, so I was anxious to see what became of the characters who survived the events of the first one. The point of view changes every now and then, which I thought was appropriate given the fact that the major characters are in different parts of the land facing different challenges and meeting new characters. Many new faces are introduced in The Two Towers, some good, some bad, and others who don't have major roles. And some characters introduced don't have any significant roles until the next installment (Eowyn is a prime example.) But all of them have some relevance to the story and therefore are important enough to keep in the film. Some characters from the book were left out completely, so anyone who hasn't read the book will have no idea that those characters even exist. Now, on to the plot. 


	The Two Towers picks up literally right after the fight in the forest at the end of the first film. The Fellowship has split up, with the hobbits Frodo and Sam going one way and Aragorn, the elf Legolas, and the dwarf Gimli going after the other hobbits, Merry and Pippin, who were captured during the battle in the woods.  Two members of the Fellowship are gone. One is killed by Orcs and the other falls(literally) in battle against a Balrog, a terrifying beast that dwells in the dangerous Mines of Moria. Frodo and Sam are making their way towards Mount Doom in the fiery land of Mordor so they can destroy the Ring of Power that Frodo carries. On their journey they meet the pitiful but dangerous creature called Gollum, who agrees to show them the way to their destination. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gilmi are hot on the trail of Merry, Pippin, and their ruthless captors, and they will not rest until they find their friends. New characters like the brave Eomer and King Theoden, and they each play a vital role in the battle against the powerful wizard Saruman, who causes a great deal of trouble for the film's protagonists. Aragorn and his companions meet up with Eomer, Theoden, and a character who was supposedly killed in Moria. Aragorn, Eomer, and the others gather at the ancient fortress, Helm's Deep, where they battle a massive army of Orcs sent by Saruman to obliterate them. 

	This movie is an instant classic. The director, Peter Jackson, is known everywhere for his work on The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and he deserves every bit of praise he receives. Jackson is one of the finest directors ever in the history of movies, and he is definitely one of my favorites. He was very careful about who he chose for the major characters, and I'm glad he was. The acting was splendid, especially Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins, and Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee. Every actor played their part well, and they each brought something special to their character. I enjoyed watching them interact on screen. Quite a bit was cut out during the transition from book to screen, but I didn't have a problem with it. In fact, I thought that the movie flowed better than the book. It is a very long movie, though, and it takes a pretty long attention span to keep up with the story and understand what is going on. There is plenty of violence and action, so it is not easy to fall asleep. 
	I thoroughly enjoyed the triumph that is The Two Towers, and I have always had a great time watching it."
"Jan 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,The second LOTR movie shows what fantasy movies are capable of. The siege of Rohan captivates and previews the epic battles of the final film.
"Jan 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,not the biggest fan ever of the series but still a great film .. i spent most of my time waiting for the 3rd one though to be honest
"Jan 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,Måste se om för bedömning
"Jan 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The spectacular continuation of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic trilogy, the fellowship has been broken, Boromir is dead, Frodo and Samwise have gone alone and unprotected to Mordor to destroy the ""One Ring,""  in their quest to prevent the Dark Lord Sauron from enslaving all of Middle-Earth. Merry and Pippin have been captured by the monstrous Uruk-hai, Aragon, Legeolas and Gimli have joined the warriors of Rohan to stand against Sauron's puppet the corrupt wizard Saruman the White; who has specially bred 10,000 powerful ferocious fighting man-beasts to destroy Rohan and the world of men. The gargantuan climatic battle at the human stronghold known as Helms Deep, is one of the greatest battle sequences in film history. Darker more focused then the original film, it is also deeply emotional and much more exciting the first installment; with a mesmerizing array of technical wizardry, the visual effects are absolutely breathtaking as are the sterling performances from Elijah Wood who delivers a passionate portrayal  of Frodo, the majestic Ian McKellen delivers a majestic performance as the resurrected Gandalf the White, Sean Astin delivers a superb, endearing turn as the loyal Samwise, Viggo Mortsensen comes into his own with a magnificently dark, brooding performance as the heroic Aragom, Orlando Bloom is fabulous as Legolas the warrior Elf, the marvelous John Rhys-Davies as Gimli becomes a wonderful comic scene-stealer, the beautiful Liv Tyler is absolutely luminous as Arwen, Bernard Hill delivers a regal performance as King Theoden, Miranda Otto gives a fine spirited turn as Eowyn, and Brad Dourif  perfectly embodies the slimy Grima Wormtongue. Highlighted by the presence of Gollum, who is hopeless possessed by the evil ring of power, he is an extraordinary blend of CGI and Andy Serkis's amazing motion-capture performance, his dual personally and well-choreographed body movements make him a starting creation. The great artistry that director Peter Jackson brings to the epic fantasy is staggering. Won Oscars for Special Visual Effects & Sound Editing. An astonishing film experience in every sense of the word.     Highly Recommended."
"Jan 24, 2010",NEUTRAL,One of the all time amazing films.
"Jan 23, 2010",NEUTRAL,One of my favorites; I consider the Lord of the Rings trilogy as one epic film.
"Jan 23, 2010",NEUTRAL,Trilogian heikoin osa.
"Jan 23, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Started as my least favorite, now one of the best. Still thought King Theoden was too weak."
"Jan 23, 2010",NEUTRAL,One of my favourites!
"Jan 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,tightness confirmed.
"Jan 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,Again Jackson does it! Two Towers is a monumental achievement! It gives war a new name! I am in awe!
"Jan 21, 2010",NEUTRAL,The Darkest of the 3 Movies.Its a great Story and visually amazing. Introducing Gollum the Maniac. Enjoy!!
"Jan 21, 2010",NEUTRAL,"It's epic, and the cast really bring it home."
"Jan 21, 2010",NEUTRAL,It's very enjoyable that the three films are all consistantly amazing.
"Jan 21, 2010",NEUTRAL,Two Towers is our next preciousss film of the LOTR saga
"Jan 21, 2010",NEUTRAL,its just so dam good!!!!!!!!! the acting is pure class luv this film and the sound track is really good another gem frm mr jackson
"Jan 20, 2010",NEUTRAL,Nothing before or sense compares to LOTR.
"Jan 20, 2010",NEUTRAL,Just can't help but love it!!
"Jan 19, 2010",NEUTRAL,this movie was the second movie that changed the movie world for me.... i think i really opened my eyes in the world of sci-fi. Tha battle scene was absolutely terriffic and action packed. Too bad smeegle turned out to by greedy and began to seek the ring
"Jan 18, 2010",NEUTRAL,"I admit it, I love midev"
"Jan 18, 2010",NEUTRAL,a sequel that doesn't dissapoint
"Jan 18, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Impresionante, a pesar de que se tomaron algunas licencias..."
"Jan 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,I class the trilogy as one long epic. A masterpiece in cinema.
"Jan 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,"not a huge fan... its ONE story.. told over the course of THREE movies. That's a long time to wait for resolution. It's slow and how do they fill all the excess time? WAY TOO MUCH camera time on Frodos big blue eyes swelling up over his unrelenting love and friendship for his friend, that other hobbit...

meh.... nice effects though.

However, if I ever see another Orc, Dragon or Elf again I may be forced to throw my own eyeballs into a volcano."
"Jan 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,"the best part of this movie is the addition of gollum. he is half funny and relatable and half creepy and distorted. and frodo feels for gollum because he feels the same way and knows that eventually he might become some sort of gollum. it is way more epic than the first also, as everything comes in a larger scale. the third is still the best."
"Jan 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The little things in the first film are fixed, and the film sucks you in and you're stuck from beginning to end. Never drags and never ceases to amaze."
"Jan 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,The war between good and evil never stop's.
"Jan 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Fellowship of the Ring is epic, but Two Towers is FREAKIN' EPIC."
"Jan 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Read all 4 books while in school and had seen lesser version released.  Even the cartoon version of the hobbit.  When I found out they were shooting all three books and saw the cast and the proposed budget I was really hoping it was going to be an epic event.  It didnt fail.  Probably one of the best movie sequals made when talking about all three movies.  The costimes, acting, scenary etc.  It was well done and probably made Tolkien proud."
"Jan 16, 2010",NEUTRAL,So the journey continues. Never a dull moment. This one was good.
"Jan 16, 2010",NEUTRAL,Continuation of the trilogy. This movie continues to do a great job
"Jan 16, 2010",NEUTRAL,"This movie is fantastic. Usually, I get bored of epic battles that last for most of the movie, but they are just so spectacularly done I can't help but enjoy them. Again, the acting is genius, and I'm still loving the sound-track. I'm enjoying the plot progression, too, because even though it's so different from the books, it's actually quite as interesting this way (and not quite as dry). Awesome."
"Jan 11, 2010",NEUTRAL,great great great movie .. I like it î¢
"Jan 10, 2010",NEUTRAL,you appreciate it more if you watch it for the second time... the third time... forth time... :D
"Jan 10, 2010",NEUTRAL,favourite of the series
"Jan 10, 2010",NEUTRAL,The Lord of the Rings series are the best movies EVER!
"Jan 10, 2010",NEUTRAL,Nothing needs to be said more at this point.
"Jan 10, 2010",NEUTRAL,"9.6/10 - Cannot give it the 100% like it's predecessor. While the film was excellent, it wasn't flawless.  New Characters emmerged here; Gollum/Smeagol, Eowyn, Riders of Rohan, Theoden...  Smeagol was wonderful as he played out: A deceptive-at-the-surface, but underlyingly endearing, troubled soul. This film tied the first and third together well, but did lack in some areas.  For one, it did have some slow spots (ents) and did drag a bit, but overall definitly worth a watch! (And a purchase)"
"Jan 9, 2010",NEUTRAL,"One of my most favorite movies. I love the way Peter Jackson can bounce around 3 different storylines in a way that not only doesn't annoy audiences, it captivates them."
"Jan 9, 2010",NEUTRAL,"2nd film in a pointless line of films which could be done in literally 10 seconds. One day I will give it a try I'm sure it is interesting, but I just didnt get it"
"Jan 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,Almost as good as the book ...
"Jan 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,"5 star, end of story, period ."
"Jan 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,"I'm a LOTR nerd, too! XD"
"Jan 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,it ties the first and third movie together okay but it definitely is the worst of the trilogy
"Jan 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Being the middle chapter of a trilogy is a tough gig, but Peter Jackson manages to pull it off. Personally I think it lacks the pacing of ""Fellowship of the Ring"", but it matches ""Return of the King"" in terms of grandeur."
"Jan 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,One of the best sequels made.
"Jan 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,"the first is better. the fighting is overdone in this film, however ive never been a real fan of the lord of the rings, so its hard for me to judge."
"Jan 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,"My favorite in the trilogy, and one of the biggest Oscar snubs EVER."
"Jan 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Ok I'm not saying I hate this movie, but it's just not my thing."
"Jan 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,Excellent Loved it..
"Jan 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,This film was beter than the first one.  The battle scenes were well done. I liked the trebuchet
"Jan 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Sir Ian Mckellen keren banget yah...
ahhh love Gandalf... udah wanti2 Gandalf mati ternyata malah nambah sakti... ^^"
"Jan 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,Probably my favorite movie in the trilogy.
"Jan 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,A brilliant sequal...
"Jan 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,better than the first one bat thats not hard to do.
"Jan 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Amazing!  Loved to the depths of my heart!  I also loved the book, so, ha.  Music composed by Howard Shore (#2 on my favorite music from score composers list)."
"Jan 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,one of the greatest films
"Jan 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,Wondrously brilliant. Peter Jackson has wonderfully and faithfully created a fantastical world from Tolkien's classic tale of good against bad.
"Jan 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,"this is actually my favorite of the series, which should really all be considered one big film, mainly because it introduces Gollum, who you begin to really hope can be saved from his state (something the book doesn't do for us). it has equally amazing sets, costumes, characters, battles, scenery, visuals, and story as the first of the Trilogy."
"Jan 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,Favorite of the trilogy.
"Jan 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,Una segunda parte que no le debe nada a la primera.
"Jan 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Great looking film but I didn't really enjoy it very much.

I found the making of documentary a lot more entertaining and interesting."
"Jan 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,The greatest of the incredible trilogy.
"Jan 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,Not the most exiting but Liv Tyler is sooooo pretty ;)
"Jan 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,Helm's Deep leaves speechless.
"Jan 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,The best action/adventure continues and doesn't disappoint.
"Jan 2, 2010",NEUTRAL,las 2 torres pero no la de nueva jork jajajaja
"Jan 2, 2010",NEUTRAL,iiiiiiiii love it so mutch
"Jan 2, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The first half is awesome, I love the portrayal of the Rohan and some fantastic scenes between phenomenal actors like Ian McKellen, Bernard Hill and Christopher Lee"
"Dec 31, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Even though I slightly disagree that this installment is better then the first one, it still is a strong sequel and more action packed then its predecessor. 
This story has us following Frodo Baggins and his best friend Sam. They lead there journey alone now, and the power of the ring is slowly taking control over Frodo. We are introduced to a new character(s), Gollom/smeagle. Mildly creepy, humorous, and sometimes endearing creature helps lead Frodo and Sam into the right direction. We also have a strong war brewing between saruman and basically everybody else. He is breeding a new army to take over everything and everyone. This story brings back our favorite characters from the first film, Aragorn, Legolas, Gandalf, and Gimli who help in the attempt to defeat Saruman.
This film is action packed, emotionally well connected, and just plain epic. A strong sequel to a powerful first movie."
"Dec 31, 2009",NEUTRAL,Peter Jackson did a great job with all of these movies.  He had great vison and had great actors palying in all the roles
"Dec 31, 2009",NEUTRAL,"least fav LOTR movie, because of the stupid trees..."
"Dec 31, 2009",NEUTRAL,Amazingly brilliant movie....!
"Dec 31, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Sem duvida o melhor da triologia, grande batalha, muito bem conseguido....
Fantastico... Parabens"
"Dec 31, 2009",NEUTRAL,"This movie is beautiful filled with action,romance and drama, the extended edition is even better!"
"Dec 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers is better than the first movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, an adaption of the classic series by J.R.R. Tolkien.  The scale of the battle scenes are incredible and very impressive, but are a little tiresome after about an hour... The Two Towers is still an incredible film."
"Dec 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,Great graphics/photography. Fun imaginery story. Interesting characters.
"Dec 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,You have to see the trilogy - in order.
"Dec 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,Epic trilogy and must have in any collection.
"Dec 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Esta buena, aunque no soy fan"
"Dec 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Better than the first. Better action sequences, not as repetitive, and does lots in it's long running time. Very highly recommended."
"Dec 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,One of my all time favourites.
"Dec 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,zzzzzzz zzzzzzz zzzzzzz
"Dec 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,sad to say i own all of these too
"Dec 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,"For the first time in years, I immediately felt the urge to watch them all again and they run over seven hours in total."
"Dec 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Similar quality of the first movie. And same as before, I find this movie overated. Its good, but not superb. Also I think that is a little bit naive. And some of the characters are as annoying as Jar Jar binks."
"Dec 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, with a lot of emotions. Really exciting, with the best battle scenes you've ever seen."
"Dec 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,"if you found the continual enjoyment I did with the first movie of LotR, this movie will in no way let you down. Not even for a minute."
"Dec 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,"With return of the King and Two Towers neck and neck, it lost out simpluy due to a bit of confusion in one action scene, but it is absolutely brilliant anyway."
"Dec 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,"This film starts off where ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" leaves off; Frodo and Sam are on their own and heading to Mordor with the sinister Sméagol who has promised to guide them through the mountains, Merry and Pippin are in the hands of Saruman's Orcs as they return to Isengard and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are in pursuit until they are diverted into helping King Theoden of Rohan.

The film switches between the three groups so we never get chance to forget what the characters are doing. I think this is the only film that I've seen where the narrative follows different groups who never meet each other. The action is even more spectacular then the previous film, the storming of Helm's Deep is one of the most spectacular scenes that I've ever seen, also amazing are the realism of Sméagol, the CGI creature based on the movements of Andy Serkis and the Ents, huge creatures that look like walking trees.

The actors did a great job, especially Elijah Wood as Frodo as he approached Mordor you could almost feel the increasing weight of the ring hanging from his neck. The cast of characters here is quite a lot larger than the previous film giving us some great new characters, the most obvious is Sméagol who was only glimpsed before but there is also the wonderfully vile Grima Wormtongue and Eowyn, King Theoden's niece who is smitten with Aragorn.

I strongly feel that it is the work of 'Peter Jackson' that prevails above all else, you see his love for the books as it explodes from the screen. The tension that slowly begins to build up as we hear of the impending doom that the Uruk-Hai bring with them from the main characters.

I felt that the battle at 'Helms-Deep' was executed magnificently, you felt each rain droplet, each roar, each swipe of a blade as it decapitated the monsters.Throughout the film there is also an amazing soundtrack that runs through it; giving the film a wonderful quality.

If you haven't seen any of the Lord of the Rings films I strongly recommend this but only after watching The Fellowship of the Ring, if you don't watch that it will be hard to understand what happens here.

Truly Magnificent."
"Dec 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,"As in the first one, the landscape are incredibly beautiful, the castles and special effect are so well done, it just makes you wanna be there. And the battle are just intense and epic. The good thing is that there is also room for romance and humour. I loved it."
"Dec 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Wow, I didn't know Hollywood could be this good since Star Wars."
"Dec 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is my second favorite film of all-time next to the first installment of this trilogy. I absolutely love this film and the entire trilogy.
"Dec 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,"This is a truly awesome movie.  The first part is kind of slow.  The movie overall is so well put together you don't care about that.  The Battle of Helm's Deep is AWESOME.  Even better ROTK, and I love that one."
"Dec 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,"+
The best acted & most concise of the 3 installments... Helm's Deep is exceptional entertainment... Darkened tone heightens the peril & suspense of the saga

The Ents talked too much & too slowly... Several stops & starts"

"Dec 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers-The best one yet, a perfect mixture of magic and action all in one film, the best acting and character development of the series and also featuring the best completely CGI character, Gollum/Smeagol to date and with perhaps one of the best last 45 minutes of film. 10/10"
"Dec 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,"In my personal opinion, The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers is the most magical, impressive and visually stunning film in existence. Peter Jackson has succeeded in creating a timeless classic. There are some of you that argue it is overrated, which I think is a travesty.

The story of the ring is epic in itself, with the trilogy by J R R Tolkien one of the most well known all around the world. And as The Sunday Times said (and you know you can trust them...) ""The English-speaking world is divided into those who have read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings and those who are going to read them."" Peter Jackson has successfully taken this story and created a translation onto screen in so much depth, bringing the story to a whole new generation. It is obvious in the viewing of The Lord of the Rings of the painstaking care and love that went into its creation.

If I had been given the cast list for The Lord of the Rings, I would have been amazed by how many big stars were on board and would have told you that it wouldn't work. I would have been wrong. Ian McKellen, Andy Serkis, Hugo Weaving, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen etcetera are, in a word, prodigious. Each and every member of the cast offers the perfect portrayl of characters in their mannerisms and identity. In esscence, no one else could have done it better.

One thing that really struck me about The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers were the battle scenes (which again were brought to life in Return of the King). If I could choose one moment that defines film for me I would say the scene where Gandalf arrives with the Riders of Rohan with the sun rising behind him. It is epic. Simply epic. Sheer epicness. E-P-I-C.

Overall, The Lord of the Rings trilogy is the pinnacle of modern cinema. As I think The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers is the strongest of the trilogy, surely it is THE best film in existence?"
"Dec 3, 2009",NEUTRAL,OMG! i love this trilogy the visual effects alone are Phenominal! the cast was fantastic the Story Line Brilliant!!
"Dec 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,"I couldnt wait to see this after the first one...It owned up to all expectations, which were very high!"
"Dec 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Yet another Peter Jackson masterpiece.  Had I spotted a flaw, it would not have ruined the overall movie experience.  This is a great movie for the book readers, as well as those who have yet to fill such a gap in their lives. 10/10."
"Dec 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,could never follow it
"Dec 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,Gandalf the white <333
"Dec 1, 2009",NEUTRAL,Love the whole series.   This one slightly less because it's the middle of a story (can't be helped) and I don't like the Ents too much.
"Dec 1, 2009",NEUTRAL,violence always rules
"Nov 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Picking up where the first film left off, Peter Jackson's THE TWO TOWERS throws the remaining members of the Fellowship into the scattered chaos of Middle-earth, now fully under siege by the forces of Sauron. While Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) journey to the dreaded Mordor, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) are held captive by orcs, and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) search for their abducted companions"

"Nov 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,best of the series i think personally...
"Nov 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,like this trilogy more than star trek or star wars... xD
"Nov 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,the second film in this triology takes up a peg with more earth shatering effects and starts were the fellowship left the viewer
"Nov 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,Battles inside and outside on the creatures of Middle-Earth! Fighting to keep they hope alive!
"Nov 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,This was a good movie. Im excited for the third one.
"Nov 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,"2 Towers,2 Stars.
These films are way too long and I  lost interest 5 minutes into the movie,"
"Nov 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,The best of the LTR triology.  The action with the battle scenes was just incedible
"Nov 26, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Didn't like it as much as the first one, but still great."
"Nov 26, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Fredda è la mano, le ossa e il cuore. Freddo è il corpo del viaggiatore. Non vede quel che il futuro gli  porta quando il sole è calato e la luna è morta."
"Nov 25, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Esta pelÃ­cula muestra que la uniÃ³n de fuerzas, hasta de la naturaleza para la lucha contra el mal es necesaria para ganar la batalla contra ella."
"Nov 25, 2009",NEUTRAL,"This is the slowest of the movies, and (in my opinion) calls for more attention than the other two. The first half is bogged down by a lot of politics, and people with silly names, but the second half picks the pace up.

Even though this is my least favorite of the three films, it is still one of the best modern films, that has ever been made."
"Nov 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,Darker than the first but continued the story with excellent action sequences and nail biting suspense. Have I mentioned these films are pure perfection?
"Nov 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,The battle for Helm's Deep could have been it's own movie. next time they'll have to do LOTR in 7 parts.
"Nov 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,The worst of the 'Rings'.

"Nov 23, 2009",NEUTRAL,Could watch it over and over again
"Nov 23, 2009",NEUTRAL,epic still building and really good movie
"Nov 23, 2009",NEUTRAL,"A seamless transition from the Fellowship of the Ring, as the fellowship has broken. Their objective continues however, as we proceed with three seperate storylines. This method of continuing the story was very effective, as all three stories are effective in setting up an action packed end to the trilogy. My favorite film of the trilogy for sure."
"Nov 22, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The Ringwraiths ride dragons. What more do you need?

The Lord of the Rings trilogy pushed the boundaries of what could be achieved with CGI in films, and is especially true with the entirety of this film. There are entire characters that are computer generated, there are magnificent cities created artificially (at least for  some shots,) and it all culminates in one of the greatest battles ever put on screen, the Battle for Helms Deep. The film lacks the whimsical flow that Fellowship had, but brings to the table a new level of drama with more characters (with impossible to remember names,) and their ultimate quest to save humanity. Itll be curious to see if the effects in this film hold up over time, but it will always be in the pages of history for using CGI for storytelling instead of spectacle, (though it acts as both.)

"Nov 21, 2009",NEUTRAL,the slowest-moving of the three.  This film continues to develop the entire story very nicely.
"Nov 20, 2009",NEUTRAL,An amazing second installment of this trilogy.
"Nov 20, 2009",NEUTRAL,the awesomeness continues....
"Nov 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,"A superb film, that makes viewers pine to see what happens in the conclusion. The direction and scenery show off what is so great about Jackson's imagery and view of how movies should be made."
"Nov 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,the book and the films are unique
"Nov 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,My least fav LOTR movie but it was still great.
"Nov 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Completely underrated. This was, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy. We'd sat for an arse numbing 214 mins of intro, via the Fellowship, and now we get to it.

It has often been criticised for being the middle part and therefore dragging, but for my money, the first two movies make a nice  story of their own, and in many ways it's The Return Of The King that is tagged on.

Short of seven hours of story had rolled on by the time we get to the end of this movie, and though you certainly feel it, I beleive that is in fact the gem of this often  criticised trilogy.

It is in many ways overly long but I feel that it's just about paced correctly not to strain the audiance to much. A problem which plagues this trilogy are its drawn out sequences which could easily be shortened without losing the impact.

The camera work is also a problem for me. Jackson WILL NOT keep his camera still for 5 minutes. Whenever there's an epic introduction of a hill, mountain, boat or horse, the camera is flying around, usually on a plane or helecopter.

It's simply tells me that Jackson had no faith in these stunning enviroments convieing their own beuty without help form his over direction.

Otherwise this was a well concieved trilogy, and this was its underrated jewel in the crown."
"Nov 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The continuation of story and characters is just as strong as the first and develops even further this time around. You really got to see the acting shine in this, Gollum was a great addition to the cast. The action sequences were amazing, Helms Deep was one of the greatest I've ever seen. Peter Jackson delivered on creating a plausible and mature look into Middle Earth."
"Nov 18, 2009",NEUTRAL,"I would say this is the most epic well made fantasy film of its type. Peter Jackson did a great job, Two Towers would have been a struggle."
"Nov 18, 2009",NEUTRAL,"It is my precious! the problem with most movie sequels is a they suck the big one compared to the original. the two towers isn't one of those films, in fact its better then fellowship of the ring. so the story continues where the last film left off with the fellowship disbanding, and Frodo and Sam heading to mordor to destroy the one ring. now the story is fantastic. its very gripping, exciting, interesting, and never boring and i watched the extended version. the action scenes and effects are awsome and allways exelerating. the acting was top notch like the last. Cast list:

Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins: the Hobbit who must destroy the One Ring, the burden of which is becoming heavier.

"Nov 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,thought it will never end...
"Nov 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,"This is my favourite of the three movies, unexpectedly, mainly due to the fact that I think it worked harder at sticking to the book and including little references to past events."
"Nov 14, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Not only is it one of the most satisfying sequels in cinema history, The Two Towers can also be enjoyed by those who may have missed out on the first film. It's extremely difficult to review any of these films apart from the first, because very much like the source material, Jackson doesn't create a fantasy that is meant to be enjoyed in segments, he creates a sweeping journey meant to be explored as one single piece, though it won't leave any of the less elite to Tolkien lore behind."
"Nov 13, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The ""Lord of the Rings"" triology, is one of the best movies i have ever watched. Peter Jackson brought the story alive in my mind. One of the best adventure movies of all times. I have watched it over and over. I even got the collectors edition with all the added effect. SUPERB."
"Nov 13, 2009",NEUTRAL,Read the books first...
"Nov 12, 2009",NEUTRAL,"It's a bit less eventful and exciting than the other two, but it still has cracking setpieces and fantastic performances and direction. A solid middle entry to the trilogy."
"Nov 12, 2009",NEUTRAL,"My least favorite of the trilogy, even with the Ents."
"Nov 12, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The second film in Tolkein's fantasy trilogy finds the fellowship shattered and scattered to the winds. Gets a little slow in spots, but very watchable."

"Nov 9, 2009",NEUTRAL,LOVE it. Beautiful scenery. characters are well interesting. Great trilogy. Not biblical like most people say. Good vs. evil maybe but thats it
"Nov 8, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Great movie despite all that was taken from the book. Additional scenes were added to round out the story, but the spirit of the narrative remain strong. This film is an expanded middle, the beginning and end of the book were shuffled out to the movies preceding and following.
The Battle of Helm's Deep is more epic than in the book, the healing of Theoden is more powerful, and Faramir's struggle is more compelling in the movie's telling.
An already excellent cast is strengthened with the additions of Bernard Hill (Titanic) , Miranda Otto (What Lies Beneath), Karl Urban (Ghost Ship), and Brad Dourif (who's been in so much its hard to begin, from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to the Voice of Chucky in the Child's Play movies)."

"Nov 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Like the first film, enjoyed it much more the second time round. Epic stuff!"
"Nov 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Spectacular second part of Peter Jackson's epic adaptation of JRR Tolkien's fantasy-adventure trilogy ""The Lord of the Rings."" In this installment, three story lines converge: the diminutive hobbits Frodo (Elijah Woods) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue on their quest to Mount Doom to have the ring destroyed; hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) enact the help of Treebeard, an Ent, who is a walking and talking tree; an heir to the throne (Viggo Mortensen), a dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) and elf (Orlando Bloom) lead in battle against the evil Orcs. Jackson miraculously keeps the action coherent and doesn't overwhelm us with exposition. Emotionally, this is the most despairing of the trilogy. As a middle segment, there is no onset and the ending is unresolved. We are introduced to the schizophrenic, fetus-looking Gollum (voiced by Andy Serkis) who is the most compelling fantasy character in movies since Yoda. The nocturnal, rainy battle at Helm's Deep is one of the great battle scenes in movie history on a grand scale that earns Jackson comparisons to Griffith, Eisenstein, Ford, Kurosawa, and Welles. Won Oscars for Best Visual Effects and Sound Editing. Written by Jackson, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Stephen Sinclair. Cinematography by Andrew Lesnie. Score by Howard Shore. With Ian McKellen as the wizard Gandalf, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett, Bernard Hill, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Miranda Otto. Filmed on location in New Zealand. Running time is three hours."

Preformances were fantastic, so passionate and real, with great direction from Peter Jackson who seems to live and breath this amazing story.

"Nov 3, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Its hard to review The Lord of the rings Trilogy as individual movies. 
I consider them all as one long 10 hour epic. But i would say that its never easy being the second movie. 
The first film set up the characters and the third lets us know how it will all end.

The Two Towers is a great achievement , effortlessly continuing the story leading up to Return of the King.

It could have all fallen to pieces having 3 separate stories to follow with Frodo/Sam/Gollum...........Aragon/Gimli and Legolas, and Merry,Pippin and Treebeard.
But peter Jackson made it all flow together beautifully to create a Sequel that leaves other sequels in the Dust.

The battle of Helms Deep showcases how far we have come in Digital special Effects adding 10 thousand CGI Characters perfectly into the shot to create one hell of a movie battle.

And Gollum is an Achievement all in itself.
Andy Serkis deserves so much credit for helping create one of the all time best movie characters.

An Oscar Nomination was sadly Missed in my opinion for the first proper on screen CGI Character that works perfectly.

"Oct 26, 2009",NEUTRAL,Bleddy brilliant Tolkien's story properly told!
"Oct 25, 2009",NEUTRAL,ive seen this film and if u havent u r missing out on a lot
"Oct 25, 2009",NEUTRAL,"worlds longest trailer, should have condensed all the films into one might have enjoyed sitting through that."
"Oct 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The Lord of the Rings saga is one of the best film series of all time and The Two Towers is the best of the three. Great story all the way through the series and the climactic battle scene is one of the best action sequences of all time. Breathtaking recreation of Tolkien's middle earth by the filmmakers. Wonderful direction from Jackson who made what most assumed would be a guilty pleasure at best into a beautiful piece of cinema. Awesome.
9.1/10"
"Oct 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.

As stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.

As assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.

As was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm's Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm's Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix's 'Bullet Time.' The battle of Helm's Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm's Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers' final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.

In The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore's score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don't think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf's passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner's Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'A-list' composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the 'A-list,' right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.

If not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers."
"Oct 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,"It will capture your attention for the actions until the last part...one action fantasy movie that will set your focus..Love this movie, ehehehe, especially w/ Legolas..."

"Oct 23, 2009",NEUTRAL,The fight sequences and action were spectacular. This second installment is brilliant and further fuels one's imagination and fascination with the world of JRR Tolkien. You cannot take your eyes off this movie for a split second because its that good

"Oct 22, 2009",NEUTRAL,i can definitely see why the series got a lot of buzz...but it's just not for me.
"Oct 21, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Not quite as good as the other two, but once again almost three hour movie and it flows along so well."
"Oct 21, 2009",NEUTRAL,"LOTR! Awesome trilogy. Excellent story, actors and so on."

"Oct 20, 2009",NEUTRAL,"IMO is the less great movie of the three. Nevertheless, is great! The scenes with tha talking trees were a bit boring."
"Oct 20, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Gollum es el protagonista de esta entrega. Las escenas de accion son memorables. Con el paso del tiempo la voy considerando cada vez mas la mejor de la trilogia, en dura pugna con la primera."
"Oct 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,fell aspleep a few times during it.
"Oct 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,"This movie is the best of the great series.  It kept the plot alive throughout the whole movie, and it is impossible to get bored once. I think that Peter Jackson is a great director who keeps the story alive throughout.  It is a very good movie, and the best of the trilogy."
"Oct 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Was so spellbound by Fellowship, I remember thinking, well, this one won't be as good. Nope, it was better! Jackson pulled all the stops and created a mastwork with this movie. Has my favorite Tolkien culture in it, the Rohan and King Theoden, my favorite character in the whole shebang. Next to maybe Gandalf... but anyway, great movie and a fantastic battle!"

"Oct 16, 2009",NEUTRAL,Epic continuation to an epic story.  All who play in this play well.
"Oct 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,peter jackson did it again! thank you for this masterpiece! the extended edition was worth the wait! i'm glad for more boromir and faramir shots! there were a great many inconsistencies with the book but who cares when peter jackson managed to bring the world of tolkien alive once again!
"Oct 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,"A step up from the first movie, Peter Jackson keeps the LOTR franchise succesfully going.
This is a movie with very very few mishaps, in fact they are so insignificant they are not even worth talking about.
Just like the first film it had great acting, directing, and an even better score. 
Not really much else to add on to that, except if you havent't seen the LOTR trilogy yet, slap yourself in the face and go rent/buy the movies now."
"Oct 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,I ENJOY ALL THE LOTR MOVIES
"Oct 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Part 2
"Oct 14, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The weakest for me of the trilogy, but it's quite a spectacle."
"Oct 14, 2009",NEUTRAL,"I love Viggo Mortensen in these movies. To me, this is the best in the series, and the original is second best."
"Oct 13, 2009",NEUTRAL,rockea esta pelicula
"Oct 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,Seen it too much to actually grade it high.
"Oct 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,A sequel superior to the first.
"Oct 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,I AM WHITE AND NERD TO WHACH THIS
"Oct 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,The person with great imagination will surely like this movie.
"Oct 10, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Absolutely stunning. This is the perfect sequel and although they have to change small parts in the book (like where the second book actually ends), they honestly are doing an amazing job with this trilogy. You are cheering on the heroes and waiting for Karma to bite the villains in the rear"
"Oct 10, 2009",NEUTRAL,"the weakest of the three - the only one where i felt like they were trying to bash us over the head with morals.... no war, all life is sacred, etc..."
"Oct 10, 2009",NEUTRAL,the first LOTR movie I saw... therefore my favorite. minus the one part w/ the creepy things that give me nightmares... XD
"Oct 10, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Watch all 3, great work"

"Oct 8, 2009",NEUTRAL,erm ok but dont really 'get' them :S
"Oct 7, 2009",NEUTRAL,Actually my favoirte of the three movies.
"Oct 7, 2009",NEUTRAL,Another amazing movie to add in with the trilogy
"Oct 7, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Der schwächste der drei, was aber an der Buchvorlage liegt. Dennoch: Einer der besten Filme, die es gibt."
"Oct 7, 2009",NEUTRAL,perfect again the best out of all three
"Oct 7, 2009",NEUTRAL,the second part is as good as the first. cnt wait for the tird
"Oct 7, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The journey continues, while upping the ante and uncertainty in every way. A classic middle movie."
"Oct 6, 2009",NEUTRAL,#2 of the LOTR series. Love the series. Own the series. Can watch it over and over and it never gets dull.
"Oct 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Wow! Very well made! Loved it! although, I liked the third one better..."
"Oct 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,"the best of the 3, mostly b/c it has talking trees"
"Oct 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,Second in the trilogy and excellent storytelling.  Great cast with plenty of action and drama.  Love this!
"Oct 3, 2009",NEUTRAL,"I cannot believe how absolutely amazing this film is, even though it strayed even further from the books, seeing the kingdom of Rohan, Isengard and Helms Deep and Fangorn Forest really bought the vision of JRR Tolkien's book to life! I think if Tolkien were alive today he would have been proud of this film, the story is perfect and the new characters introduced really give this film some extra depth. This is without a doubt my favorite part of the trilogy and my very favourite fantasy film of all time."
"Oct 3, 2009",NEUTRAL,xD casi me duermo pero si sta bien
"Oct 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,awesome..watch it thousand times...
"Oct 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Part 2 of the triligy and the movie is good but the book as so much more and so much better but other than that, the movie is a must see if you ask me.."
"Oct 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,This one ventured from the books more than the others but what it produced was a fantastic movie! Gollum set motion capture forward to heights that would set a standard for films to follow that decade.
"Oct 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,one of the best movies ever made
"Oct 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,10% for effects. Read the book again to wash your brain from soap!!!!
"Oct 1, 2009",NEUTRAL,I LOVED THESE MOVIES..!
"Oct 1, 2009",NEUTRAL,Understand a bit more!  Hopefully by the end of the third film I will have it sussed.
"Sep 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,As with all trilogies the 2nd is the best.
"Sep 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,this trilogy was brillliant!!! i will love it forever!
"Sep 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,"On the contrary to many other reviewers, I do not believe that Two Towers lost anything great that Fellowship had.  The cast is expanded to new characters following the book so many people have to readjust to the new characters.  The mix of new and old cast works just as harmoniously as it did in Fellowship.  For those who need action, Two Towers definitely has more of it and the Battle of Helm's Deep is better than how I imagined when I read the books.  The extended edition of the film adds much to the story which I believe should not have been left out.  Should have won more awards than it did but hey still one of the best."
"Sep 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,"In my opinion the best of the trilogy (although they are all astoundingly awesome), The Two Towers dominates the screen with all the goodness from The Fellowship of the Ring, as well as even more mind-boggling special effects and what is quite possibly the greatest battle sequence ever filmed, the Battle of Helm's Deep that occupys much of the last hour or so of the movie."
"Sep 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,Playing the middle part in the trilogy is very difficult but it is done very well in this movie.
"Sep 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,Sneaky little hobbitses!
"Sep 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,What more can I say...
"Sep 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,love the book but not really keen on the movies
"Sep 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,Awesome is all i can say
"Sep 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,I love the visual effects
"Sep 26, 2009",NEUTRAL,"I regard the Two Towers almost as highly as I do the Fellowship of the Ring. The story is still fantastic and brings the novel to the screen perfectly. The acting is solid and the special effects are incredible. It's run time is a bit too long for my liking, but that's just about the only bad thing about it. Every scene with Gollum is an utter spectacle to watch, as the character has an unbelievable amount of depth, although it doesn't get too boring or confusing."
"Sep 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,I love every LOTR movies...they are amazingly well done.
"Sep 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,My precious! LOL that is all I have to say.
"Sep 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,love the orc war...great visual effect...
"Sep 18, 2009",NEUTRAL,Wow. Amazing soundtrack and story.
"Sep 18, 2009",NEUTRAL,Make sure you watch the Extended Edition!
"Sep 17, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Probably my least favorite of the trilogy, but that doesn't mean I can't still love it. Gollum is a excellent addition to the cast, and the buildup to the final battles at the end are well worth the wait."
"Sep 17, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Empire strikes back, get your coat and leave."
"Sep 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,"A great sequel to a great movie!! Story is great, the music is great, a really good cast,... I just love it, what else can i say?"
"Sep 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Another series I loved... not enough to learn to speak in elf, but you get the picture! Fantastic action, fantasy, they really did the books justice!"
"Sep 14, 2009",NEUTRAL,It's LOTR and Orlando as Legolas - what else can you ask for?
"Sep 14, 2009",NEUTRAL,"One Liner:

Peter Jackson does brilliantly in making the second book come to life"
"Sep 14, 2009",NEUTRAL,"C'est bien, c'est beau (non je la ferais pas celle ci) mais on s'emmerde ... juste un peu, heureusement que la bataille du gouffre rattrape un peu."
"Sep 14, 2009",NEUTRAL,yes definately brilliant

"Sep 13, 2009",NEUTRAL,The second in a unforgettable trilogy
"Sep 13, 2009",NEUTRAL,it was meh. i like fantasy films and i thought i would be more into it but alas i wasnt :(
"Sep 13, 2009",NEUTRAL,**you need to watch the first and last film of this trilogy before and after watching this one... if you know how to create a 3-hour + plus taht starts and end at the middle of the entire story but doing it with poise which this film did... then you are a good director... kudos to Peter Jackson...
"Sep 13, 2009",NEUTRAL,"much better and longer than the first film..more fight secenes, more dead orcs....ahh, you get the picture..."
"Sep 12, 2009",NEUTRAL,i hate lord of the rings
"Sep 12, 2009",NEUTRAL,"An Earth-shattering film. The CGI was monumental, it still looks impressive by today's standards. The acting and writting was top notch. Elijah Wood improved his performance and made it even better. It was fabulous. The cast was perfect and in terms of just being plain, epic, it doesn't get any better than this. I didn't even notice that this movie clocked in 3+ hours."
"Sep 12, 2009",NEUTRAL,Anotjer great peter jackson film.  good lead up to the third movie.
"Sep 12, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Some flix so gala, cant be made again."

"Sep 7, 2009",NEUTRAL,good fights and battles gollum is brilliant but again whiney frodo is annoying
"Sep 6, 2009",NEUTRAL,All of the lord of the rings are great.
"Sep 6, 2009",NEUTRAL,"One of the only sequels that was every bit as good as the original, it was exactly what a sequel should be.  It continued the story, added an amazing new character (Golum), and had an even more impressive fight at the end of the movie than the first one, yet it wasn't about topping the first movie, it was about continuing the story, and that's where the Two Towers really just destroys virtually every other part II movie that's out there.  I would even go so far as to say it is the best sequel ever (yes, even better than Godfather II or Empire Strikes Back)."
"Sep 6, 2009",NEUTRAL,(This was the Special Extended Edition) Dazzling visuals and a good story. A sequel that gets better and not worse like some trilogies...
"Sep 6, 2009",NEUTRAL,"An excellent film and adaptation of the books overall, with Fellowship and Return of The King.

One of the best films of all time."

"Sep 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,that was awesome fantasy storyline
"Sep 1, 2009",NEUTRAL,"this is more like it from an enjoyment perspective as the journey to deliver the ring to the fires of mount doom starts to heat upas frodo has split from the pack to make it to his destination on his own whilst the legolas, aragorn etc fight off sarumans forces whilst gollum obstructs frodos path as he also has a desire to have the ring...much better movie than the previous ones with better battles and overly just more exciting"

"Aug 31, 2009",NEUTRAL,"They changed one or two things from the book, grr."
"Aug 31, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Got kind of boring what with all the walking, 3rd film was the bests"
"Aug 31, 2009",NEUTRAL,Might be my favorite of the 3
"Aug 31, 2009",NEUTRAL,epic film. It's a masterpiece in the genre of fantasy!
"Aug 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,Possibly the best of the three as it contains the most action but is still shallow and transitional and generally just not very good.
"Aug 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,"amazing, incredible, breathtaking"
"Aug 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,"More excellence in this film, much like that provided in the first film.  Again, the casting is superb and all characters are well portrayed by their respective actors.  The battle scenes are more epic in nature and very well done.  The score is still awesome.  The story in this film is not as close to the novel as the first film, but I find this to be alright, as it does add more drama to different plot threads that may have been lacking in the novel.  Again, this movie is quite excellent in my opinion."
"Aug 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,before ya watch this watch the first ones first so u can get the story line its a good movie overall
"Aug 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Was fortunate to see this film on the big screen again last night -- this time with a live orchestra performing the score at Wolf Trap. The music is so powerful & majestic in this 2nd part of the trilogy anyway, but live, it was magical."
"Aug 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,They keep getting better
"Aug 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The second movie in Peter Jacksons epic that wrote him into the movie directors hall of fame, it is one of the best movies ever made."
"Aug 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,"super movie,, saw it 5 times.great"
"Aug 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,"my least favorite of the trilogy, but the trilogy itself is so strong it still kept my interested."
"Aug 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,Great sequel. Peter Jackson doing great telling the story. The effects are awesome. Cast is great.
"Aug 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,everything about this movie amazes me
"Aug 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,Just like the first one. Amazing continuation.
"Aug 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,Better than the first and last of the films...
"Aug 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,once again I got one of the towers for this masterpiece
"Aug 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,good part of the series.
"Aug 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,i didnt give these movies a good chance at first...but my girlfriend got me hooked on these movies...and i love them!!!
"Aug 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,a part of a great trilogy
"Aug 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,Fabulous second act for the LOTR Saga
"Aug 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,http://content6.flixster.com/movie/25/61/256112_tmb.jpg
"Aug 26, 2009",NEUTRAL,A root canal is more fun.
"Aug 16, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The 2nd installment of the Lord of the Rings...and does not disappoint.  In fact does more than the first.  More intense battle scenes, funnier dialogue, and goes way beyond with the special effects.  This movie also has one of the best opening sequences I have ever seen in movie.  On top of all this introducing new characters and creatures adds so much more to this movie while still maintaining the greatness that was the Fellowship of the Ring...its beyond belief!  Peter Jackson has done one hell of a job and if your fan of fantasy you will love the hell out of Lord of the Rings!"
"Aug 16, 2009",NEUTRAL,Amazing cast & effects. Very good adapted screenplay. People who work at Weta Workshop are crazy sauce. Excellent.
"Aug 16, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Lord of the Rings the Two Towers is the squeal to the first of the three Lord of The Rings movies.
It has outstanding special effects which are bought together with a excellent level of performance delivered by the dedicated actors of this movie. The actors performance is great and even if you are not a fan I would suggest checking this movie out on the acting grounds alone.
The only let down of the movie is long drawn out conversations that seem to deviate from the storyline, but it still remains a solid movie despite this fact."
"Aug 16, 2009",NEUTRAL,Love the scene where Eomer comes back to King Theoden.
"Aug 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,The books were better if slower.
"Aug 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,"An improvement upon the first film, showing the determination through all odds of a fractured fellowship against all forces of evil and the introduction of some truly brilliant characters Two Towers is a masterpiece and a go to guide for epics to come."
"Aug 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,"A grand epic, just as stunning as the first film in the series. This one is more slow paced, and more of a character film but it still manages to be extremely powerful and quite emotional.  Ian McKellen still deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of Gandalf and Viggo Mortensen gives a brilliant performance as well. The technical aspects of the film are astounding and the battle sequences are like none other I've ever seen. Another brilliant classic from Peter Jackson."
"Aug 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,I love the Lord of the Rings movies
"Aug 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,What can i say fantastic!
"Aug 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,great film. the fight scene last over 30 minutes. it was brilliant. best movie out of the three.
"Aug 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,Boromir: [holding the ring after Frodo has lost it] It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thing. Such a little thing.
"Aug 14, 2009",NEUTRAL,lord of the rings is the best movie ever! :] its long but really good
"Aug 14, 2009",NEUTRAL,agen a very good lord of de rings film :)
"Aug 13, 2009",NEUTRAL,i am a sucker for number 2's.
"Aug 13, 2009",NEUTRAL,Part 2 in the second best trilogy of all time (the first being the original Star Wars trilogy).  The effects are outstanding and Peter Jackson is an epic story teller.  The infamous Battle Of Helm's Deep is breathtaking and a neo-classic moment in film history.
"Aug 13, 2009",NEUTRAL,all of them are great movies.
"Aug 13, 2009",NEUTRAL,Fantastic! The movie is on a whole other level.
"Aug 13, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, lots of action, good story"
"Aug 13, 2009",NEUTRAL,"A major step forward for the Middle Earth Saga. Peter Jackson can sure make a movie that is more in depth. Unlike the original, this one is exciting from begining to end. It became more then just Frodo, it had a second story to it that became one of the most epic yet.

The story still follows Frodo, of course. Elijah Wood this time improves his acting and I can actually watch him without having to worry. He and Samwise Gamgee(yes thats his name) are on their way to Mordor. In the meantime in Rohan, a king is under the influence of the dark lord. And his family as well as his kindom has become ghosts. Its up to the three heroes Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli to save someone yet agian. Despite chasing two fellow hobbits. Guess they didnt matter. But they cant do it alone. They must need the white Gandalf. Apparently he didnt die and is now back stronger then ever. Ian Mckellen once agian flourishes but with whiter hair.

The film focuses on two stories. The old king who listens to a homeless guy. Yes a homeless man who has bad odor and doesnt seem to wash his hair. Not to forget, he has a crush on a young gal who doesnt show a hair of interest in him. The other story would be Frodo and his BFF trying to destroy the ring. But they keep going around in circles so they get help. From Gollum of course. The ingrate that tried to steal the ring. Yet they need him since he knows the way. So might as well suck it up Samwise Gamgee. Is'nt that his job? To be wise. I guess not because he focuses to much on how to feed Frodo then to protect him. Gollum actually saves Frodo on more then one occasion.  I liked how Jackson told two stories at the same time while playing splitscreen. He keeps it in balance and it doesnt lose track.

The acting has always been superb and in this latest installment, it hasnt changed. This film features great cinematography and stunning visuals that doesnt bore you. It actually makes worth its 3 hours. Which is hard for any filmmaker to do. A definant improvement from the original.

A near masterpiece that is drivened by soulful characters that features some of the best looks in film history. Its dazzling of course. But it tells a great story that always amazes me. I can admit that I am more Frodo friendly. A must see film that deserves its oscars."
"Aug 12, 2009",NEUTRAL,Best Trilogy Ever By Far
"Aug 12, 2009",NEUTRAL,"I like this movie, because it is very consistent throughout the movie, and although it doesn't end the story there is a definite end to this segment of the story. Check it out, if you haven't already."
"Aug 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,It's a good film... nothing to really think about but still good...
"Aug 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,My personal favorite out of the three.
"Aug 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,absolutley amazing!!!!
"Aug 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,i hated it its borin
"Aug 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,I thought this was the best of the three--I was so impressed and thought it was an amazing film.
"Aug 10, 2009",NEUTRAL,th e best of the 3 but....
"Aug 10, 2009",NEUTRAL,awesome as the extended version
"Aug 10, 2009",NEUTRAL,I love this series.  The battle for Helm's Deep was amazing in the theater.
"Aug 10, 2009",NEUTRAL,"I liked this movie, but the third one is better."
"Aug 9, 2009",NEUTRAL,"There are many beautiful landscapes here. Middle-earth and its inhabitants look comepletly authentic. The story splits up into 3 interesting storylines and creates a very rich and stimulating experience. I love the storyline involving the walking tress, who are very well visualized and whose voices sound incredibly majestic. Feels a little longish, though. Once again, the action sequences don't sit too well with me( they feel kinda sluggish) but they are incredibly detailed with hundreds of soldiers battling at the same time. And I can't comepletaly comprehend the lore and expanding narrative of the saga. I feel like I'm cramming for a test."
"Aug 9, 2009",NEUTRAL,This is my favorite of the trilogy. Battle at Helm's Deep!
"Aug 9, 2009",NEUTRAL,Anyone who dislikes LOTR is an idiot.
"Aug 9, 2009",NEUTRAL,"A classic piece of phantasy fitted as screenplay. The numerous intriguing sub-plots will get any viewer through this three-hour special-FX farrago of adventure, suspense, war, distant memories, love & friendship."
"Aug 9, 2009",NEUTRAL,I LOVE THIS ONE TOO!!!!!!!
"Aug 9, 2009",NEUTRAL,"weakest of the three, but still a great movie."
"Aug 8, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Probably my least favorite theatrical version of the 3 films, but the extended version bumps it up there with the other 2 movies in the trilogy. I can't get tired of watching these films year after year."
"Aug 8, 2009",NEUTRAL,"crazy wow.  This series shows how each installment actually gets better.  loved this film when I first saw it on christmas day 2002, love it now."
"Aug 8, 2009",NEUTRAL,"It's Great, all of them."
"Aug 8, 2009",NEUTRAL,"As part of the novel trilogy, part 2 may of been the weak section, in the movies it may be the best of the 3.  The diversity of the sub-plots is what gives it that extra boost and oddly enough the Frodo quest is the weakest of the group.  

The ranger, the elf, and the dwarf search for Merry and Pippin who have been captured by Orcs and in the process they also find the wizard, Gandalf, who helps them release the spell put on the King of Rohan and points them in the direction of the real culprit, the white wizard Saruman.  

What was once the weak point of the novel turns into a strong point of the movie, the introduction of the Ents.  A tree that becomes life-like can seem pretty comic like if put in lesser qualified hands but in Jackson, the Ents not only provide a seamless transition but are one of the highlights in the whole series."
"Aug 8, 2009",NEUTRAL,loved it! breathtakig
"Aug 8, 2009",NEUTRAL,My favorite one out of the three!!
"Aug 7, 2009",NEUTRAL,the extended version hits all the right spots and explains alot the theatrical didnt. a must see
"Aug 7, 2009",NEUTRAL,Helms Deep: Greatest battle of all time!!!
"Aug 6, 2009",NEUTRAL,Great film. The least of the series but still a very good film. Has lots of action with a good story.
"Aug 6, 2009",NEUTRAL,Trumps the first with intense action and well done character moments. The extended version is even better.
"Aug 6, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Dunno if it's the best of the trilogy, but I certainly prefer the battles in this one. If we could somehow make a cross between Fellowship and Two Towers then it'd be an incredible movie!
Also remembered there's the Osgiliath part which could have been perfectly left out (not the extended scene featuring Boromir and Faramir mind you which was great but the Frodo/Sam part), particularly since it's not in the book."
"Aug 6, 2009",NEUTRAL,beautiful  move..and   nice  history
"Aug 6, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, decent adaptation, amazing visuals. I think I liked the extra on this film more than I like to rewatch the movie."
"Aug 5, 2009",NEUTRAL,good set of movies all of them
"Aug 5, 2009",NEUTRAL,"dont knock it till youve watched it 5 times, bought the sword,helmet and hand of sauron in glass case. And even then dont knock it.
pure genius"
"Aug 5, 2009",NEUTRAL,one of the great movie of all time ^^
"Aug 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,Another one of my favorite movies of all time!
"Aug 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,The extended cut is excellent. Far-better than the heavily and not very well edited theatrical release.
"Aug 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,"""A perfect transitional second installment that carries the trilogy from being good to being GREAT."""
"Aug 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,PÃ©plum des temps modernes ... J'adore.
"Aug 3, 2009",NEUTRAL,got to love all 3 lotr movies

"Aug 3, 2009",NEUTRAL,The work makes me realize this trilogy is a something!
"Aug 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,This is one of those movies who stay in the history of celluloid forever. A great production...
"Aug 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,"very good, solid film. Improves on The Fellowship and left me hankering for Return of the King at the time."
"Aug 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,"WITCH ONE IS THIS ONE AGAIN ? 

to long of films"
"Aug 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,Yet again LOTR used dazzeling graphics that make the movie more exciting and fun to watch.
"Aug 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,Best one of them all!!
"Aug 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,I love all Three LOTR Films but this is the Best!!
"Aug 1, 2009",NEUTRAL,My favorite of the three movies. It is a masterpiece. Visual effects are outstanding. Love this movie!! It makes my Top Ten if all time.
"Aug 1, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Excellent open ended storyline, what would be expected with the middle film. Great special fx."
"Aug 1, 2009",NEUTRAL,1 of my most favourite movies. my favourite part is the battle of helms deep.
"Jul 31, 2009",NEUTRAL,Loved that trilogy! Everything is well done & you can see how passionate the irector is about everything he's filming! A great piece of cinema!
"Jul 31, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Peter Jackson left the entire world on a cliffhanger when he finished The Fellowship of the Ring. After having done such an impressive job with the first film and then having the balls to stay true to the source by finishing as he did, he was almost setting himself up to fail; giving himself a task even greater than the original undertaking: a sequel. Not just any sequel; a sequel to film being touted as one of the greatest fantasy films ever made and himself being declared a genius. This sort of hype is almost impossible to live up to. Almost.

Taking up where its predecessor left off, The Two Towers follows Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas as they chase down a troop of Uruk-Hai, Frodo and Sam as they journey further towards Mordor and Merry and Pippin as they, well, get into lots of trouble.

The story is much more divided in comparison to the first of the series with a fellowship of nine journeying together rather than three different groups and their various shenanigans. This is the first challenge to overcome for filmmaker Peter Jackson: how to tell all these stories in under four hours? Not only that, but how to allot time to the different storylines without 1) making it boring and 2) losing focus on the main story which just happens to be the more boring aspect of the source material: Frodo and Sam's trek towards Mordor. After all, how inventive can one director be with half the story taking up by two diminutive figures walking towards a place which they don't actually reach by the time the films finishes?

It's almost as if Jackson hasn't noticed these issues as the second film is just as fulfilling and story-driven as the first without sacrificing any major plot points or basically getting rid of anything that would cause a fan outcry. Yes, technically the ents do show up to help at the battle of Helm's Deep and no we don't get to see Merry and Pippin in Treebeard's house or talking to Quickbeam but in the end, Peter Jackson has conquered these seemingly mammoth tasks with ease. This is a reflection on Jackson's instinct for pace, as the extended edition shows that these time-consuming though unnecessary scenes were in fact filmed, but were left on the editting floor. Jackson's fearlessness with the source material yet mindfullness of it as well means that the story is left completely intact; enough to appease any fan. Jackson has also made room for the lighter moments as well, revelling in the joy of discovery when Merry and Pippin first encounter Treebeard and having time for jokes between the double-act which just keeps getting better of Legolas and Gimli. Jackson doesn't forget about his characters either, keeping the film from feeling hollow by introducing the beautiful Miranda Otto as never-to-be love interest Eowyn and the abandoned-by-his-country Eomer as well as extending his existing characters in Merry and Pippin who only get more endearing, Frodo and Sam whose seemingly unflappable relationship is beginning to show some strain. And even though Gandalf's character goes under a major revamp he's still the same enigmatic mentor as before, albeit slightly more badass. It's this attention to detail which makes Peter Jackson's work so watchable, all the way through the crazy runtime.

Shore's score is as strong as ever, this time bringing the beautiful theme of the world of men to the fore. Shore's understanding of motif and mood is pivotal here, even more so than Fellowship as the story isn't as driving as its predecessor. Because of this, Shore's score is able to ferry us through the slower moments and throughout the entire film.

The performances here are just as textured as they were in the first film. Not only that, but the sequel factor means that actors are able to loosen up a little more, in particular in the case of Orlando Bloom's Legolas and John Rhys-Davies' Gimli. The two of them have more fun than it should be possible to have in an epic of this size and they pull it off without ever feeling camp or not taking it seriously enough. Ian McKellen's Gandalf is still the standout of the series but it's great to see the rest of the cast becoming more and more involved in their characters. Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn is one of the performances which shows a lot of progression. His presence has more gravitas in this one and his character is more layered than the original; more difficult to read. Elijah Wood has much less to do in this film, leaving him to keep mostly the same expression on his face for most of the film. While this may be true to story, it does occassionally make you wish that he had something else to do than walk around some rocks for a while. Sean Astin's Sam is similarly beleagured and while their parts of the film are integral to the story, you sometimes wish that we'd move back to the interesting parts a little sooner. Bernard Hill makes a great addition to the cast as Theoden as well as his onscreen daughter Eowyn played with fragile strength by Miranda Otto. Brad Dourif's Grima Wormtongue is fantastic; a slimy, manipulative groveller who snivells perfectly through every scene he's in.

Another of Towers' achievements lies in another of its new characters: Gollum. Gollum is a completely CG creation, performed by Andy Serkis with groundbreaking technology, enabling Serkis to interact with the actual actors and thus makes the performances all the more real. This innovation makes for incredible viewing as one of the more unfilmmable sections of Tolkien's work is brought to life onscreen. Serkis' performance is largely discounted in terms of acting accolades but it's incredible to see. His work here set the benchmark for motion capture.

But all these technical factors fade into the background at the Battle of Helm's Deep: a battle scene so epic that it drowns out everything that comes before it. Ten thousand Uruk-Hai facing off against Rohan's much depleted forces is so overwhelming that it makes it difficult to spot any kind of flaws in the rest of the film. Jackson seamlessly blend CG with fantastic costume and makeup to create an entirely believeable all out war which lives up to the scenes detailed in the book and revells in the little moments like Legolas riding a shield down some stairs or a rousing speech from King to King. Jackson's sense of pace throughout the battle is fantastic, moving from the Entmoot to Sam and Frodo without ever losing momentum. And the coup-de-grace of Gandalf's arrival is as breathtaking a moment as the series brings in any of its three films.

While this may be the weaker cinematically of the three films, the fact that I'm still giving it five stars shows you just how high the bar is set for this series. The fact is that, despite lacking the grandeur of the third and the sense of wonder and scariness of the first, it's still a better film than 90% of the blockbusters Hollywood vomits up on regular basis. Truly incredible filmmaking.

Defining Scene:
The Battle at Helm's Deep. Of course.

"Jul 31, 2009",NEUTRAL,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
"Jul 31, 2009",NEUTRAL,"great movie.seen it many times,still its the best movie ever made till date!"
"Jul 31, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Peter Jackson takes the director chair once again on this sequel to The Fellowship of the Ring did he captivated audience worldwide again? Yes.

Packed with superior CGI, greater battles and memorable dialogues, The Two Towers not only makes you feel that the nearly 3 hours you just spend sitting down and watching greatness weren't enough but makes the audience feel excited for the final part of the epic trilogy based on J.R.R. Tolkien's series of books.

Better than The Fellowship of the Ring and arguably The Return of the King, mainly because of Peter Jackson's fantastic vision. The Two Towers easily ranks as one of the best movies of 00's."
"Jul 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,"As thrilling and richly drawn as it is, there is an obvious awkwardness in the dialogue and direction. The production values are, naturally, brilliant, and carry the film, along with J.R.R. Tolkien's imaginative and deeply-constructed story."
"Jul 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,"9.6/10. The best of the 3. Still, you want more."
"Jul 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,luv this trilogy film..!
"Jul 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,"the best of the three, exceedingly well put together and i have to say it's just flawless execution"

"Jul 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,All three were excellent movies... long as hell but worth it!
"Jul 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,"My least favorite of the trilogy, but still a good movie."
"Jul 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,I was impressed with the entire series considering I didn't have any desire to watch them.
"Jul 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Pretty cool, but not as cool as the first."
"Jul 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,tyte continuation of The fellowship...
"Jul 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,I still haven't seen any whole LotR movie beacuse I usually fall asleep while watching it. It's really that boring. Just aweful.
"Jul 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,A very good adventure tale.
"Jul 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,"owwwww 
i dunno if saruman had his ring..."
"Jul 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,Brilliant - the best of the trilogy.
"Jul 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Bloody amazing, the best movie in one of the best film series of all time."
"Jul 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,Tht Two Stars are for the one big battle Scene - Otherwise - Boring!
"Jul 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Start perang cincin dekat sini. Antara puak Rohan dengan tentera Saruman, Uruk Hai......."
"Jul 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Spectacular scenes, good script, amazing performance. I simply love it."
"Jul 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,"LotR, what else can one say?"
"Jul 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,"By far the best of the trilogy. Akin to ""The Empire Strikes Back"", this whole movie is a down-note. The film as a whole is breathtaking, exhilarating and absolutely awesome."
"Jul 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,Too long fell asleep
"Jul 26, 2009",NEUTRAL,My least favorite of the trilogy.
"Jul 26, 2009",NEUTRAL,"these are my favorite movies, enough said"
"Jul 26, 2009",NEUTRAL,THE BEST MOVIES EVER
"Jul 25, 2009",NEUTRAL,"alrite movie, the introduction of gandalf the white vs the grey was uber lame"
"Jul 25, 2009",NEUTRAL,shot beautifully... cant get into it though
"Jul 25, 2009",NEUTRAL,A great classic with brilliant actors.
"Jul 25, 2009",NEUTRAL,A lot better than the first film
"Jul 25, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Fantasy fun, but overly long and done."
"Jul 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,"When this film came out, I didn't go to the theater to see it. My friends shunned me for a while. My wife and I have the extended edition and it kicks. I love this movie. If its one thing I've learned from watching it, its never kill and Ent's best friend."
"Jul 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,my favorite of the trilogy. Great war scenes
"Jul 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,The best of the trilogy in my opinion. The siege at the end is one of the best moments in cinema history and I love the trees as well. A real mile stone in fantasy adventure films that i can't ever see being beaten.
"Jul 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Dark, well executed and is a brilliant enough standalone film even by itself, the second movie deserves my five stars and is by far my favourite among the trilogy of an equally brilliant franchise. Thumbs up. All four of them."
"Jul 23, 2009",NEUTRAL,Continuing the saga.  Warning watch this film in its entire special edition version.  The theatrical cut is disjointed and does tremendous disservice to the narrative.
"Jul 23, 2009",NEUTRAL,"It was very good, CGI was amazing, story was well made and loved most of the characters! It was very good but I thought of it more as a filler movie but I still enjoyed it!"
"Jul 23, 2009",NEUTRAL,Best f---ing movie ever!
"Jul 23, 2009",NEUTRAL,Just the filler movie in between the two good ones...
"Jul 22, 2009",NEUTRAL,Good. It was the best one in the series!
"Jul 22, 2009",NEUTRAL,good film if you can keep up with who is who.
"Jul 21, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Extended Version is much more in depth with characters. My least favorite of the three films, but still great. The creation of Gollum is spectacular."
"Jul 20, 2009",NEUTRAL,Another great installment of the trilogy. But I did think the Ents went on for EVER - way too sloooooooooooow and tedious. But I guess it is the nature of those gnarly-ass tree characters. Treebeard - I dig your wisdom dude but can you finish this little insight before the next millenium? Those scenes were interminable. ThxB2G for fast forward and scene scan.
"Jul 20, 2009",NEUTRAL,"My least favourite of the three, but still very good."
"Jul 20, 2009",NEUTRAL,This is how its meant to be done.
"Jul 20, 2009",NEUTRAL,"This film is truly flawless and beautifully continues the Lord of the Rings series. This film is a massive improvement from the first film. The scenes are much more interesting and they move at a perfect speed and give enough time for the viewer to understand the plot. This film introduces new characters which have great depth. The battle scenes are truly epic. This film, in my opinion is far better then the first one in terms of action and entertainment. This film also has strong emotion. A true epic and classic."
"Jul 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,Still don't get it..
"Jul 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,my favorite movie of the lord of the rings trilogy....
"Jul 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,"walking, walking, walking...."
"Jul 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,One of the greatest action films EVER!!!
"Jul 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Better than the last one, not as good as the first."
"Jul 18, 2009",NEUTRAL,By far one of the most epic fight scenes of all time
"Jul 18, 2009",NEUTRAL,The reason i dont give this one full points is the scene where Legolas is surfinÂ´down a stairway on a shield. A totally ridicolus idea from mr Jackson.
"Jul 18, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The Fellowship of the Ring was an amazing achievement, a fantasy epic, and one of the most amazing movies of our time. This movie is no different. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a fantastic film, and doesn't disappoint at all. 

This movie picks up right where the the last film left off, so it springs right into action. Everything is just as good in this movie as it was in the original. With some additional characters this movie remains entertaining to the final credit. 

This movie looks like it was an effort to make, which it was, and this isn't a bad thing because the movie ended up excellent. The battle of Helm's Deep, looks to me like one of the most enduring, difficult, and amazing scenes ever to be produced in cinema. I heard it took months to shoot so you really have to appreciate this film and all it's hard work. 

Howard Shore has done a good job on all of the LOTR movies, and the Two Towers has a great soundtrack. The music keeps us watching, and this film is much better with it then without it. 

Plot wise we see a build up of emotion from many characters. For instance, Frodo starts to feel more and more of the burden of the ring, and Legolas and Gimli are starting to build as friends. This, in my opinion is just like the book, and I love how these three films stay true to the novel. 

This film is excellent. Though out of my opinion this is the worst in the series, that hardly means its not fantastic. It's a great film in every sense of the word. A fantasy masterpiece."
"Jul 18, 2009",NEUTRAL,Amazing amazing amazing!!!
"Jul 18, 2009",NEUTRAL,"This movie is pretty much flawless, and an excellent followup to its prequel, Fellowship of the Ring. The movie is genuine in its own way, and gives the LOTR feeling a boost in plot and story. It gets much more intense, and there's good character development.
One thing about this movie that will catch anyone's eye is the amazing special effects. There phenomenal for 2002. I'd say this film is the best of its trilogy. And the trilogy is amazing. So watch it and be amazed."
"Jul 18, 2009",NEUTRAL,really good film too
"Jul 17, 2009",NEUTRAL,Beatiful. It is one of my all time favorite movies.
"Jul 17, 2009",NEUTRAL,golum scares the crap outta me every time but its a great movie lmao it keeps u on the edge of your seat near the end
"Jul 17, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Fantastic movie! Great actors, magnificent scenery..."
"Jul 16, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Not quite as good as Return of the King, but still very good.  I was skeptical when I heard Jackson was doing movies of one of my favorite book series, but I have come to love these movies.  Sure they leave out a lot of what's in the book, but they have stirred up renewed interest in one of the literary classics of the 20th century so that's good."
"Jul 16, 2009",NEUTRAL,"I already see it, i don't know what to say .... it's a good movie"
"Jul 16, 2009",NEUTRAL,brilliantly directed..a difficult part in the trilogy to translate into film
"Jul 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,i love that movie it was great all the killing and stuff a saw it 20 times
"Jul 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,When I read the book I went right to the battle at helms deep great movie
"Jul 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,"It's awesome, buy it!"
"Jul 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,The bridging book builds the mood and brings in the big guns and leaves us salivating for what awaits us next with Return of the King.
"Jul 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Too much of the same thing for me, still a great movie, though."
"Jul 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,I liked it almost as equally as the first. It was pretty fantastic.
"Jul 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,Not my favorite of the trilogy.
"Jul 10, 2009",NEUTRAL,Good but very long movie.
"Jul 10, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The CGI is better, but the story doesn't progress very much. Good character development though. I think the highlight of the movie is easily the introduction of Gollum/Smeagol."
"Jul 10, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The weakest of the trilogy, since there is occasional cheesy dialogue. But this is mostly compensated for by the multi-stranded plot and the fact that Gollum, a schizophrenic CGI monster filled with character and given great voice acting by Andy Serkis, gets the most screen time in this one."
"Jul 10, 2009",NEUTRAL,My personal favorite of the trilogy.
"Jul 10, 2009",NEUTRAL,a good movie you ought to watch it!

Peter Jackson did a great job in 2nd time around... If you're looking for a cinematic masterpiece, look no further. These entire trilogy is by far the greatest movie I have ever seen.. Legolas is the best character of bloom, my favorite scene was in the photo above..  when legolas ride in the horse.. 
this film is very memorable.. celebrating Christmas Eve in the hospital because of this film..."
"Jul 9, 2009",NEUTRAL,where the first film bored me slightly this one expands on it with some exciting action sequences and a highly engaging plot as the fellowship has dispanded the trip to mordor becomes a treacherous trail. brilliant film and in my opinion the best of the trilogy
"Jul 9, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Gollum: We wants it, we needs it. Must have the precious. They stole it from us. Sneaky little hobbitses. Wicked, tricksy, false! 
Smeagol: No. Not master! 
Gollum: Yes, precious, false! They will cheat you, hurt you, LIE. 
Smeagol: Master is our friend! 
Gollum: You don't have any friends; nobody likes you! 
Smeagol: I'm not listening... I'm not listening... 
Gollum: You're a liar and a thief. 
Smeagol: No! 
Gollum: *Murderer*. 
Smeagol: Go away! 
Gollum: ""Go away?"" 
[Gollum laughs as Smeagol begins crying] 
Smeagol: I hate you, I hate you. 
Gollum: Where would you be without me, gollum, gollum? I saved us! It was me! We survived because of me! 
Smeagol: [stops crying] Not anymore. 
Gollum: What did you say? 
Smeagol: Master looks after us now. We don't need you anymore. 
Gollum: What? 
Smeagol: Leave now, and never come back! 
Gollum: No! 
Smeagol: Leave now, and never come back! 
[Gollum screams in frustration] 
Smeagol: LEAVE! NOW! AND NEVER COME BACK! 
[Gollum is silent] 
Smeagol: [looks around] We told him to go away... and away he goes, Precious! Gone, gone, gone! Smeagol is free! 

Lord of the Rings The Two Towers al igual que la primera son obras de arte. A pesar de que le puse un 9 en vez de el máximo puntaje no le quita ese reconocimiento. Lo único que le tengo que criticar es el hecho de que luego de The Fellowship of the Ring que es una película tan llena de magia y descubrimiento, ya que es el comienzo de todo, viene esta que es totalmente distinta, más oscura, seria y casi todo en un mismo ambiente. No es que tenga nada de malo, pero supongo que la primera me preparó para algo que ésta no me entregó. Pero eso no le quita el hecho que en su propio merito sea increíble."
"Jul 9, 2009",NEUTRAL,only like it cause orlando bloom is in it =]
"Jul 8, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Watched it, but didn't really watch"

"Jul 5, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Jackson delivers again with greater cinematic intensity.
Andy Serkis as Gollum shall be revered as one of the best motion capture performances ever. The ensemble cast deliver's once again while Howard Shore continues with a great original score.
The battle scenes in particular have been beefed up from the first and it must be said that the action and plot development do seam cohesivley to create a breathtaking and mindblowing experience in terms of depth and scope.

Best film of 2002? yes
 My only disapointment from the film is that of the three it won the least amount of awards."
"Jul 5, 2009",NEUTRAL,long but good fim. prefer return of the king.
"Jul 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,my least fave of all 3 but still a good movie
"Jul 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,"CLASSIC, PRETTY GOOD"
"Jul 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,i love this whole trilogy.. peter jackson is awesome.. hello Karl Urban!
"Jul 3, 2009",NEUTRAL,I love this movie! Absolutely superb :)
"Jul 3, 2009",NEUTRAL,no em dan las estrellas
"Jul 3, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Great epic battle sequences... and just like the other two, didn't mind that it was 3 hours long."
"Jul 3, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers continues the saga of the quest of the Fellowship of the Ring to destroy the One Ring. This Chapter sees them scattered and the movie focuses on the exploits of the people of Rohan at the Battle of the Hornburg. Peter Jackson may have focused more on the fight sequences and added the coming of the elves for dramatic purposes, but all in all, he captures the struggle of the impossible fight Middle Earth was facing to overcome such a relentless movie. Absolutely stunning...the greatest fantasy of all time..."
"Jul 3, 2009",NEUTRAL,So bad. Even for this shit series.
"Jul 3, 2009",NEUTRAL,"A case of the whole being better than the sum of it's parts.

Watch on it's own.....pointless.

With it's friends....indestructable!"
"Jul 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,"all of these are so much more interesting than the books, and surprisingly accurate. Like, to the word accurate."
"Jul 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,"All the LOTR movies were beautifully crafted. They take you away to a world of might, magic, legend and adventure, and does not let go of your imagination long after the movie is over.  I enjoyed 2 more than I enjoyed the first one.  Simply stunning cinema, that is, if you enjoy a reality escape from time to time.  I do."
"Jul 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,A story about the power of friendship.
"Jul 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,Expectations of reality = depression
"Jul 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The battle at Helm's Deep alone is worth the whole movie, awesome CGI mixed with practical effects, great performances by the entire cast. A very underrated movie."
"Jul 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,this was endless. i thought i was going to die!
"Jul 1, 2009",NEUTRAL,justice always win..
"Jul 1, 2009",NEUTRAL,susunan citer yg menarik..graphic pun gempak
"Jul 1, 2009",NEUTRAL,the battle at Helms deep is probably one of my favorite battle scenes. great movie
"Jul 1, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Oh jeez, you have no idea how this movie reminds me og my Freshmen English teacher."
"Jul 1, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Andy Serkis is unbelievable. Christopher Lee is a great Saruman (that voice) but IMHO doesn't get nerarly enough to do. Old wormtongue is suitably unpleasant, but what the hell is the deal with Faramir? I mean, no disrespect to David Wenham, but he looks wrong, and ok, let's by all means cut extraneous material in the interests of running time, but why did they have to start MAKING SHIT UP? Purlease! There's a whole plot strand here that NEVER HAPPENED! Sorry to be a sad pedant but there it is - it utterly changes the characterisation and everything. Honestly, some people...

Treebeard rocked, however.

And Shelob scuttled. Shudder. Wonderful."
"Jul 1, 2009",NEUTRAL,BORING BORING BORING. EVEN MORE BORING THAN THE BOOK.
"Jun 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Oddly enough, this one was my favorite of the three for awhile. I don't know if it still would be, but I love it."
"Jun 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,Solid middle-part of perhaps the greatest fantasy film of our time.
"Jun 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Not entirely faithful (vide: Elves at Helm's Deep, hobbits in Osgiliath) but I do love the intercutting between events in Books III & IV, and the trilogy is (and always will be) one of my best movies EVER"
"Jun 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,Action is great love the fight scenes. One  the best movies ever.
"Jun 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,"epic fantsasy. frodo is a homo though, good thing there are a lot of other really cool characters"
"Jun 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Better than the first one, enjoyed watching."
"Jun 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,sequal from the trilogy..best but wait for the final movie..
"Jun 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,Finally more action!
"Jun 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,FAN OF THE SERIES. EFFECTS WERE AWESOME.
"Jun 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,keeps you to edge of your seat
"Jun 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,Very good movie.  But very dark
"Jun 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,"A great movie to follow up a great movie, check it out."
"Jun 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Watched the Lord of the Rings, wasn't my movies"
"Jun 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,"My least fav of the three, but its still pretty sweet."
"Jun 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Peter Jackson did not let us down as the sequel of LOTR: The Fellowships of the Ring is a masterpiece. Amazing CGI effects were applied, and the new character Smeagol although revolting in my opinion, has definitely played it's part well."
"Jun 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,Favorite of the three original for some reason....
"Jun 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,the weaker of the three if i am totlay honest but still one of my all time favorites
"Jun 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,its better than the other two
"Jun 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,love it love it love it
"Jun 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,The weakest link in a strong trilogy of films. The Two Towers sports some amazing acting and great action sequences.
"Jun 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,better than the first one but still overrated
"Jun 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,I remember after 9/11 that people wanted the name to be called TLOTR- Two Towers.  Idiots.
"Jun 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Bigger, better and more amazing than the fellowship of the rings."
"Jun 26, 2009",NEUTRAL,see previous comment!
"Jun 26, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Well, I completed Lord of the Rings in the weirdest fashion possible. I watched the last one, the first one, and finally the middle one. Much like the first one, I enjoyed the movie, but it's annoying that it ends so unresolved. Of course, since I've seen the third of the trilogy, I knew what was going to happen. This just filled in some details for me. I am a little annoyed by movies like these that require you have a list of all the character names and definitions to random made-up words if you want to be completely aware of what's going on."
"Jun 26, 2009",NEUTRAL,Peter Jackson did a fantastic job interpreting this epic piece.
"Jun 26, 2009",NEUTRAL,one of the best movies i got
"Jun 25, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Why, oh why, do we get this trash after the great movie that was Fellowship? What on earth, or middle-earth, would possess Peter Jackson to abandon the source material in favor of warg-riders and a RIDICULOUS sidetrack to Osgiliath, just to get the Faramir character to a point at which he should have been when he met Frodo? Remove that crap and you could have had Shelob in this movie, where she belongs. ""Legolas, what do you elf-eyes see?"" A bunch of elves marching into Helm's Deep, which never effing happened. This movie is crap."
"Jun 25, 2009",NEUTRAL,my fav one in all of the trilogy!!!!! but also my fav films ever!!
"Jun 25, 2009",NEUTRAL,Frodo Baggins is the worst name of all time
"Jun 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,less hobbit scenes please!!!
"Jun 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,a brilliant movie. ican watch thiis over an over again..jejee
"Jun 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,really liked the whole series
"Jun 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Amazing, like them all."
"Jun 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,"I love a second act.  Everything  from Fellowship continues here, with more war.  I love this film."
"Jun 23, 2009",NEUTRAL,orlando bloom... ganteng..hihii
"Jun 23, 2009",NEUTRAL,ok...i really love dis one
"Jun 23, 2009",NEUTRAL,"the lord of the rings are possibly the best movies ever made

absolutely amazing from start to finnish

stunning with an excellent story

perfectly cast 

if u have not seen these moves you are missing the amazing adventure unlike any other"
"Jun 23, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Just like the 1st, this film is awesome. Here, we see a new character (who had little tiny scenes in the first film) called Gollum, and he adds brilliance to the whole film! LOTR: TTT was really epic and brilliant, and I recommend everyone to see it, if they don't want to miss out on a superb film!"
"Jun 23, 2009",NEUTRAL,"As with the first in this trilogy of films, this is a wonderful adaptation of Tolkien's masterful work of fantasy, which does great justice to the original material.

The casting is great, the special effects are wonderful, and I can think of nothing bad to say about this movie. And the extended cut DVD is even better.

A must see film that has earned all the praise it has received."
"Jun 22, 2009",NEUTRAL,"It was alright. It was my least favorite of the series. The Battle Of Helm's Deep was amazing, though."
"Jun 22, 2009",NEUTRAL,You should see it even if you haven't read the books.  Personally I got very soon bored but I acknowledge the importance of this trilogy.
"Jun 22, 2009",NEUTRAL,oh i loved this as well as the first 1 and the thid one as well
"Jun 21, 2009",NEUTRAL,Sir Ian Mckellen is awesome
"Jun 21, 2009",NEUTRAL,i adored the wars in it
"Jun 21, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Keeping all the magic and charm of the first movie, and adding in some spectacular action, Peter Jackson's presentation of this phenomenal sequel takes the standards of filmmaking up another level and presents some scenes that will never be forgotten."
"Jun 21, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Ummmm, the Last March of the Ents, the Battle for Helms Deep = awesome."
"Jun 21, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers is a worthy follow-up to the Fellowship of the Rings. Acting, scenery, make-up, everything is top-notch, and Peter Jackson has truly brought Tolkien's masterpiece to life on the big screen. Whether you are a Tolkien fan, or simply enjoy an engrossing film experience, The Two Towers is definitely worthy of your attention. The Battle of Helm's Deep was my eldest son's favourite."
"Jun 21, 2009",NEUTRAL,hate it. too long and too point-less
"Jun 20, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The best installment in my favorite movie trilogy of all time. Awesome fantasy battle scenes, amazing special effects, and very true to Tolkein's novels."
"Jun 20, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The second part in the epic trilogy originally written by Tolkien and adapted by Peter Jackson is sensational! 
The Two Towers stars Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, Bernard Hill, Andy Serkis, Sean Astin, Miranda Otto and Cate Blanchett and they are all brilliant. It also stars Orlando Bloom, John Rhys-Davis, Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd, Karl Urban and Hugo Weaving. The cast are all fantastic!
The film follows Frodo (Wood) and Sam (Astin) as they struggle to reach Mordor and Mount Doom. They find the help of Gollum (Serkis).
Meanwhile, Aragorn (Mortensen), Legolas (Bloom) and Gimli (Rhys-Davies) search for Merry (Monaghan) and Pippin (Boyd) and instead encounter Gandalf (McKellen), who has come back to life. 
Saruman (Lee) is becoming more powerful and securing his place next to Sauron during the destruction of Middle Earth. Filled with fantastic effects, a brilliant script and great acting - The Two Towers is incredible!
Overall - Extremely enjoyable - 96%"
"Jun 20, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The second movie of three, the Two Towers continues to follow Frodo and Sam on their dangerous mission to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring."
"Jun 20, 2009",NEUTRAL,epic battle sequence
"Jun 20, 2009",NEUTRAL,So painfully boring the other two are classics but this is a mess.
"Jun 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,My favorite of the 3
"Jun 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,The only triology that gets better with each successive film...
"Jun 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,Really long movie but unforgetable.
"Jun 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,The battle at Helms Deep really gives the a detailed action feel that the previous and proceeding lord of the rings film weren't able to provide. raaaar to the urak hais.
"Jun 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,"This film everyone has to see, its an Epic movie of its time.
Just make sure you watch the first of the trilogy, then this, and then go on to LOTR Return of the King."
"Jun 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,The walk keeps going
"Jun 18, 2009",NEUTRAL,another one in da row...amazing cinematography!!..loved watching it..
"Jun 18, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Amazing movie, NOT to be seen in the Middle of the night all alone.  I've seen it, I want to see it again, and abolutely love it."
"Jun 18, 2009",NEUTRAL,If this story was re-made 50 years from now there is no possible way it would be an improvement on this current triology. It manages to portray the atmosphere and drama of the book perfectly. It is perfection
"Jun 17, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Now that I see it amongst the other LOTR movies, it suffers from classic middle movie syndrome.  But it is still cool."
"Jun 17, 2009",NEUTRAL,this is lotr were talking about...ian mckellen is brilliant...and then there oh god just about everyone else except orlando bloom...he SUCKS at acting..
"Jun 17, 2009",NEUTRAL,the 2nd installation of the novel.. Great Battle Scenes..
"Jun 17, 2009",NEUTRAL,"This was much better than the first... Andy Serkis should have won an award for his performance, or whatever computer genius that brought him to life... also, the introduction of the Ents was a bonus. I haven't read the book, but if the script is any where close, then Tolkien had some serious issues with women. Or at least whoever he based his dwarf on, who is always drooling over human women and elf women, saying some really disparaging remarks concerning dwarf women. And with the amount of Ents there were, how the hell did they ALL lose their wives? In this part we learn that Orcs started off as elves. And although elves can be killed, apparently they can also live for ever (?or just a long long time?). However, if you still look as old as Hugo Weaving and your hairline recedes, what good is that?"
"Jun 17, 2009",NEUTRAL,the weakest one out of the three. it was like a waiting film until the the big finale.
"Jun 17, 2009",NEUTRAL,Even better than the first one. Peter Jackson and company continue their story without many flaws.
"Jun 16, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The weakest of the trilogy, still has its strengths."
"Jun 16, 2009",NEUTRAL,A great movie that was a perfect follow-up to the Fellowship of the Ring.
"Jun 16, 2009",NEUTRAL,Peter Jackson- I love you- everyone should see your movies
"Jun 16, 2009",NEUTRAL,Love It! The whole trilogy is awesome. I can watch this movie over and over.

"Jun 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,A great film that ties the first and last movie.
"Jun 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,"I believe this set of movies is one of the best series. The actors were amazing, the effects great and it rlly followed after the book. Nothing tops lord of the rings"
"Jun 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,GREAT MOVIE   STAYED VERY CLOSE TO THE BOOK
"Jun 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,Easily my favorite of the film trilogy.
"Jun 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,this is my favorite out of the 3
"Jun 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,Best to keep one's enemy's close.
"Jun 14, 2009",NEUTRAL,Now this one is a better movie than the last.
"Jun 14, 2009",NEUTRAL,My favorite of the three; but I have a soft spot for last-ditch-stand stories.
"Jun 14, 2009",NEUTRAL,the story about the battle of good and evil as well as the quest of frodo continues in this terrific sequel... the best parts for me were the battle of the hornburg and the flooding of isengard
"Jun 13, 2009",NEUTRAL,i hate alll the lord of the rings.
"Jun 13, 2009",NEUTRAL,Best sequel ever I wish I could watch it again.
"Jun 13, 2009",NEUTRAL,The most interesting of the trilogy
"Jun 12, 2009",NEUTRAL,Good Movie series...
"Jun 12, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Decent installment, but still good for all fans of the LOTR trilogy."
"Jun 12, 2009",NEUTRAL,"A great follow-up to a great beginning. Perhaps the best sequel ever made. It continues Tolkein's vison flawlessly. Portrays the now familiar characters as ones of increasing sympathy with greater weights on their shoulders. It makes seeing the final film imperative, which is the point of any sequel. Superb"
"Jun 12, 2009",NEUTRAL,so friggin long!!!!!!!!
"Jun 12, 2009",NEUTRAL,suffers from middle child syndrome
"Jun 12, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Filler, but how sweet it is."

"Jun 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,its just toooooo loooong to watch
"Jun 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,Awesome. Just awesome.
"Jun 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,"An intense, action-packed and truly fantastic second part, which manages to maintain all the allure and integrity of the original. The character of Gollum is visually astounding, and the acting, on the whole is an incredible thing to behold. At times, it does suffer from being the middle chunk of a story, but to it's credit, it fights off any worries you may have before they manage to crop up in your mind."
"Jun 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,Aragorn... so lovely..
"Jun 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,This is my favourite of the three.
"Jun 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,once again i love the adventure.
"Jun 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,Helms deep = amazing.
"Jun 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,"I always liked this one the most but somehow it doesn't work anymore.
It still is a great movie and again it's amazing what they did.
Again they have a lot of running through the different landscapes :D"

"Jun 7, 2009",NEUTRAL,"...
LOVE THIS MOVIE!!"
"Jun 7, 2009",NEUTRAL,as good as the first.
"Jun 7, 2009",NEUTRAL,My favorite don't give up movie
"Jun 6, 2009",NEUTRAL,It's a movie about people walking to a fucking volcano....
"Jun 6, 2009",NEUTRAL,not as good as the first Lord of the rings...
"Jun 6, 2009",NEUTRAL,The action begins!!!
"Jun 6, 2009",NEUTRAL,I have seen all LOR movies...aI absolutely love them all!
"Jun 6, 2009",NEUTRAL,this is the bestest......
"Jun 6, 2009",NEUTRAL,Meet me @ Middle-Earth.
"Jun 5, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Perhaps the most exciting of the three films, it also has some very poignant turns by Miranda Otto and Bernard Hill."
"Jun 5, 2009",NEUTRAL,I Love The Lord Of The Rings. I Guess That Makes Me A Nerd.  LOL
"Jun 5, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy in undoubtedly one of the largest causes of my passion for epic fantasy. To pick the best movie of the 2000's decade, I would have to 'cheat' and choose the entire trilogy. It is visually perfect, shown in an epic scope still unsurpassed in cinema, even by visually ambitious films like Avatar. The acting is wonderful, with Ian McKellen as a perfect Gandalf, and Howard Shore's soundtrack captures the soul of this story's grand adventure brilliantly. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is the best movie event of the 2000's and one of the absolute best of all time."
"Jun 5, 2009",NEUTRAL,a mi juicio la mejor de las 3..
"Jun 5, 2009",NEUTRAL,Awesome finale of the film adaptions.
"Jun 5, 2009",NEUTRAL,My favorite movie of all time
"Jun 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Less cheesy than the first, epic, awesome."
"Jun 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,"from what i saw before the disc crapped out on me, really good"
"Jun 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,never missed any of it..
"Jun 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,At least they added in some humor to keep you interested.
"Jun 3, 2009",NEUTRAL,"to tell u d truth it made me cRy...
no more cments...."
"Jun 3, 2009",NEUTRAL,Ok if you like that type of movies.The company was better than the movie.
"Jun 3, 2009",NEUTRAL,classic action my precious
"Jun 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,the trilogy were GREAT.
"Jun 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,awsome but better than the first one the battle of helms deep is the best
"Jun 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,:) :) :) wow!!! go legolas!!! kinda sad coz boromir died...
"Jun 1, 2009",NEUTRAL,A slower second act to the trilogy. But a crucial part to an epic quest. A great bridge between our other films and a strong pivotal developing point for our heroes.  Wonderful.
"Jun 1, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Mr. Carlson, my film comp. teacher in high school, said that he thought each ""Lord of the Rings"" film was better than the last because Peter Jackson had more time to work on them as you go down the line. I agree. I think each part in the story gets more intense, the battles are more perfected, the stakes higher. And I'm not going to pretend it doesn't have its slow moments, but for as slow as those moments are, the battle scenes are as action-packed. And, just as ""Fellowship"" did, you are more than ready to watch the next installment upon the film's end."
"Jun 1, 2009",NEUTRAL,Best of the series. Three thumbs up!
"Jun 1, 2009",NEUTRAL,"again i liked the action of course, and the twists in the plot. i liked it less because gandalf died of course."
"Jun 1, 2009",NEUTRAL,My fav of the tril. Love the movies and the soundtracks. Well done.
"May 31, 2009",NEUTRAL,"good, but third is the bomb."
"May 31, 2009",NEUTRAL,Excellent.  Loved this movie.

"May 31, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The second chapter of The Lord of the Rings trilogy is amazing, just as the other two are."
"May 31, 2009",NEUTRAL,have tried - keep falling asleep
"May 31, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Why didn't I rate this before?

Anyways, this is the best movie ever... EVER!

From music to scenery to the CG in Gandalf's beard this movie screams perfection. Even it's 3 hours long it'll make you stare at the screen until it goes to a break.

A must watch for fan of sorcery and medieval type movies."
"May 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,Peter Jackson is my hero.
"May 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,really entertaining.
"May 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,"""It needs but one foe to breed a war, and those who have not swords can still die upon them."" The Two Towers, a pro-war film, would be denounced if released today in 2009. Demonstrating the perils of appeasing evil, the necessity of distinguishing friend from foe, the folly of isolationism, and the risks of immoderate deliberation, this is a film with traditionalist lessons."
"May 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The middle act of a trilogy is inevitably difficult to pull off.  While ""The Two Towers"" is not perfect, it does do an awful lot of things well.  Gollum is formally introduced, and the technology behind the pathetic creature is technically amazing.  The residents of Rohan, a land of majestic horses, are pulled into the struggle against Sauron and his dark forces.  The Ents, an ancient race that are closely related to trees, are also caught in the middle.  The fellowship remains splintered, and that allows for growth of character for Sam (Sean Astin), Frodo (Elijah Wood), Merry (Dominic Monaghan), Pippin (Billy Boyd), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), and Gandalf the White (Ian McKellen).  New characters Faramir (David Wenham), Theoden (Bernard Hill), and Eowyn (Miranda Otto) help to enrich the already-rich world.  The Battle of Helm's Deep is a truly great scene of cinema. Although much exposition is necessary, it all pays off in the final film."
"May 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,It was an interesting movie the acting was good but the story was a bit too complex if you didn't read the book... too many characters to keep track of...
"May 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,Awesome! Give it to someone you idolise!!
"May 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,"ok movie, but way too long and boring. This seems like it was a filler movie. there wasnt much action."
"May 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,"I know it's the middle film in the trilogy, but it's still WAY too long for a film with such a flimsy/nearly nonexistent plot."
"May 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,La continuacion parece que se hizo en un solo toque.
"May 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,Totally badass and Gollum/Smeagol steals the film.
"May 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,epic movie u have to see!!! that's the perfect tRilogy i've ever saw...
"May 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,"this wasnt my favourite at all. dodnt judge me, i just dont know why i didnt enjoy it as much :/"
"May 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,"good sequel no let down,"
"May 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,"REALLY REALLY LOVE THESE REALLY REALLY LOVE THESE
REALLY REALLY LOVE THESE"
"May 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,I enjoy all of the rings but the last one could have ended better (I mean not so many times).
"May 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Is it just me, or is Christopher Lee NEVER a good guy?"
"May 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,not as good as the last one
"May 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,Very true to the novels. Loved it.
"May 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Great Movie, Awesome Effects"
"May 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,legolas!!! orlando bloom.haha
"May 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,not much better than the first. However the army of trees were the main highlight of the film.
"May 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,This trilogy is awesome.  Each of the 3 movies is at the same caliber
"May 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,"""Shall I describe it to you, or would you like me to find you a box"""
"May 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,More love for Peter Jackson
"May 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,"DeuxiÃ¨me partie, (toujours en version longue) et on reste toujours dans l'histoire. Le personnage du Golum y est pour beaucoup. Seule la bataille tourne un peu au grand guignol mais c'est pas sensÃ© Ãªtre fait pour rÃ©flÃ©chir, juste du bon cinÃ©ma de distraction."
"May 26, 2009",NEUTRAL,My favorite part of the trilogy of films. The plot's simple enough to follow; the cinematography and musical score are astounding and the battle of Helm's deep is breath-taking. King Theoden makes the best speeches of the film and the scene in which the people of Rohan prepare for battle is a beautifully constructed one. I loved the Viking-like athmospere throughout the happenings in Rohan as well as the gloomy sights in Osgiliath. A bit of a pity is the fact that Gimli is turned into a comic relief but I can forgive that much. Ãowyn's love for Aragorn is depicted well - and the foundation is built for her role in part 3.
"May 26, 2009",NEUTRAL,The best of the three.
"May 26, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Brilliant story, acting and SFX."
"May 26, 2009",NEUTRAL,Same as here been pretty good busy movie ppl has cool
"May 25, 2009",NEUTRAL,Add a review (optional)...
"May 25, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Not a fan of the whole hobbits thing, loved speigel though!!!"
"May 25, 2009",NEUTRAL,I liked this one of all what 30 of them...hehehe
"May 25, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The worst of the 3 LORD OF THE RINGS films. It's good, but not great."
"May 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,I loooove the trilogy!!! TLOTR!!!
"May 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,Getting more interesting! still facinated by those Ears! though!
"May 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,"HISHE 
Could you imagine if we'd to walk the whole way?"
"May 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,"genial, even you have read the book"
"May 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,Only Because It Was Filmed In My Country
"May 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,Yet another movie that will go down in history.
"May 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,besh la..siapa ckp xbesh..;p
"May 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,Nice movie. I like it so much ne~~
"May 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,"One of those middle pieces in a trilogy. Still pretty good, but long."
"May 23, 2009",NEUTRAL,The second of the EPIC 3-part Lord of the Rings saga. SEE IT!!!
"May 23, 2009",NEUTRAL,This was my favorite of the three movies. I don't know why. It's just great.
"May 23, 2009",NEUTRAL,"""The Battle for Middle-earth Begins!""

I think this is the best in the trilogy. This was where I understood why the trilogy was eligible for Best Picture."
"May 22, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The battle in Helm's Deep.. definitely cool.
I think all leaders should be like King Theoden. in war, he stands in the front line and is the first to charge at the enemy. he knows how to raise the spirit of his army. he cares for them, and they are willing to die for him.
Too bad that Haldir dies in that battle.

Allow me to quote my favourite line here:
""I am on nobody's side, because nobody is on my side.""
says Treebeard the Ent.

The competition between Gimli and Legolas.. it's so funny. of course i cheer on Legolas. khehehe.. but they both really are skillful in fighting. go slay the ugly orcs!!"
"May 22, 2009",NEUTRAL,Very good film both in story and special effects.
"May 22, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Again,another excellent film."
"May 22, 2009",NEUTRAL,a darker chapter of the trilogy. very creative and nice effects.

"May 21, 2009",NEUTRAL,I own it and love it
"May 21, 2009",NEUTRAL,Tolkien would be proud of this series.

"May 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,this one was my personal favorite othe the 3
"May 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Me encanta, pero no tiene sentido si no ves las otras dos partes. Trilogía totalmente recomendable."
"May 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Me gustan más la primera y la tercera, pero lo bueno de ésta es que Aragorn se sigue viendo guapísimo"
"May 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,The 'dark' second episodes are always the best stories..
"May 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,"seen it, was long, kept my interest"

"May 18, 2009",NEUTRAL,lord of the rings is awesome
"May 18, 2009",NEUTRAL,"This movie wrapped itself around me 
I loved it xx"
"May 18, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Ah LOTR, absolute geek *ahem* neek flick, and it is wonderful... though why frodo cant get rid of the damn ring right away ill never know... T_T"
"May 17, 2009",NEUTRAL,definetly the best of the three
"May 17, 2009",NEUTRAL,What can i say? AWSOME.
"May 17, 2009",NEUTRAL,If you enjoy this genre you won't be disapointed. All of the Lord of the Rings installments are masterpieces...
"May 17, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Best trilogy ever (yes, Star Wars, that includes you, although ESB is superior to the three LotR films combined). My only regret is that I could watch it more often... but it's so loooooonng."
"May 17, 2009",NEUTRAL,Best film of the series.
"May 17, 2009",NEUTRAL,ALL I HAVE TO SAY WHOA
"May 17, 2009",NEUTRAL,all of them are great
"May 17, 2009",NEUTRAL,"So far, the best movie I've ever seen in my life. I'm so satisfied with everything...cast, story, music, visual effects. Well, I just hope it's never-ending..Haha!"
"May 17, 2009",NEUTRAL,"I love all three, but there's just something extra special about this one... dunno quite what that is."
"May 17, 2009",NEUTRAL,lord of the rings bores me
"May 16, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Great epic movie, lousy book adaptation"
"May 16, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Hello! I'm a D&D nerd, all of these movies I made sure to see in the theater. Peter Jackson did a great job at bringing Tolken's vision to life."
"May 16, 2009",NEUTRAL,Great fight scenes. Wonderful music. Breathtaking cinema. This can be said about all the LOTR movies.
"May 16, 2009",NEUTRAL,"i'm not really into 'war' scene movies, but LOTR made me actually like a 45 minute battle scene. epic. 3 hours of awesome."
"May 16, 2009",NEUTRAL,the best one among this series
"May 16, 2009",NEUTRAL,Pretty much loved it.
"May 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Midway through, picking up steam. Made me wait impatiently for final part."
"May 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Boring 2 hours then 45 minutes of one of the best ""fight"" scenes Ive ever seen.

But seriously the first 2 hours are terrible"
"May 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,I did like all of them but they were too long for me.
"May 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,"i'm no expert on the series, but this is my favorite film of the three"
"May 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,The best of a poor trilogy.
"May 14, 2009",NEUTRAL,I love the Lord of the Rings - in fact i'm going to go watch it now.
"May 14, 2009",NEUTRAL,What can I say? All three films are terrific!
"May 14, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Bellissimo stupendo film!
Forse il migliore della trilogia le 3 ore filano e non ci si annoia un secondo!
La Compagnia dell' Anello si scioglie e si seguono le varie storie...
Stupenda la battaglia al fosso di Helm, entrata nella storia del cinema perchÃ¨ dura 45 minuti!!
In questo film si conoscono meglio i vari personaggi e se ne aggiungono di nuovi, inizia a delinearsi il destino di Frodo e della Terra di Mezzo e vengono approfonditi certi aspetti.
Da brividi il discorso di Sam alla fine del film, da guardare piÃ¹ e piÃ¹ volte!!!!"
"May 14, 2009",NEUTRAL,my mom made me watched it at the movies
"May 14, 2009",NEUTRAL,One of the most powerful spectacles ever filmed.
"May 14, 2009",NEUTRAL,ceritanya tambah seru niy!!!!
"May 13, 2009",NEUTRAL,The whole series got old quickly.
"May 13, 2009",NEUTRAL,(Director's Cut version)
"May 13, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Fab films all of them, would love a new 1 out"
"May 12, 2009",NEUTRAL,A bit confusing in the middle. The battle of helm's deep was spectacular and Gollum looked very life like. The first two of the trilogy are a good set up for the big finale which awaits.
"May 12, 2009",NEUTRAL,omg this is the one with talking trees!!! :O
"May 12, 2009",NEUTRAL,An brilliantly acted fantasy adventure that does Tolkien's second chapter justice.
"May 12, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Just as great as the first one, if not better!  It took me a while (and with the help of my brother-in-law) to understand the meaning of the two towers."
"May 12, 2009",NEUTRAL,"I said all that i could hav possibly said, this movie is definetly the bomb."
"May 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,Just getting started.
"May 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,good stuff. full of swords fighting and elves shooting arrows and little hobbits getting mugged
"May 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The movies themselves are fine, so are the stories, but it's just not really my thing."
"May 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,Loved the battle scenes and the acting.
"May 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,"happy, happy, happy....  love the ittle people, so cute but deadly, great movie for the whole family i think, just close the eyes of the young    XD"
"May 11, 2009",NEUTRAL,"interesting theme, good"
"May 10, 2009",NEUTRAL,The movie I went to see on my first date with Chelsea. It might be a sentimental five-star favorite :>)
"May 10, 2009",NEUTRAL,"is an ok movie !
not that big of a deal"
"May 10, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Frodo et Aragorn sont toujours des pleureuses, mais bon y'a des belles scènes quand même"
"May 10, 2009",NEUTRAL,Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers
"May 10, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers is by far the best film in the epic triology. Again we see the journey of Frodo and Sam to Mordor on their mission to destroy the Ring. 

Peter Jackson again manages to deliver perfection in the form of an amazing film. Not only do you feel the struggle of Frodo and Sam's mission, but we also witness links to the first film that make the attachments on certain characters, like Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas much stronger.  We are introduced to Gollum in this second installment and see one of the most visually stunning battle scenes of all time. I was lucky enough to see this at the cinema and was an experience i'll never forget. Oh, and I bloody well adore Andy Serkis."
"May 10, 2009",NEUTRAL,I was amazed at what they got on screen considering limitations.
"May 9, 2009",NEUTRAL,my must seen and collected movie...
"May 9, 2009",NEUTRAL,Frodo and Sam continue on to Mordor in their mission to destroy the One Ring. Whilst their former companions make new allies and launch an assault on Isengard.
"May 8, 2009",NEUTRAL,excellent Jackson is a great one for these types of movies
"May 8, 2009",NEUTRAL,"all good, but waaayyyy to long"

"May 6, 2009",NEUTRAL,"It was good, I loved all 3 it really stuck to the book as much as it could, guess thats why it was long"
"May 6, 2009",NEUTRAL,"elijah wood,,
u rock!!"
"May 6, 2009",NEUTRAL,another sequence of my most favorite trilogy
"May 6, 2009",NEUTRAL,"10/10! Helm's Deep earned this movie its perfect score. As well executed as the first movie, which is expected since they were being filmed together."
"May 6, 2009",NEUTRAL,"... and the quest goes on ...
Help is found where you less expect it. Hope is what drives us forward."
"May 5, 2009",NEUTRAL,"A little bit better than the first, especially with Smeagle. But, still a tad too long."
"May 5, 2009",NEUTRAL,"best trilogy of movies ever, jackson did a fantastic job"
"May 5, 2009",NEUTRAL,agak membosankan di pertengahan
"May 5, 2009",NEUTRAL,"A big change from the first film. A lot more grown up, and with the great Helm's Deep scene. Seems a bit lacking in plot though."
"May 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,Great film and left me wanting more at the end :o)
"May 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,Buenos efectos pero se comieron un capitulo muy bueno!!
"May 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,"It lived up to its expectation and more. A lot more action in this one, which is great."
"May 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,Great sequel. Brings you deeper into the battle for Middle Earth. I loved it!
"May 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,The battle of Helm's deep is perhaps one of my favorite battle scenes of all time.  Well done.
"May 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,a nice filler in the searies
"May 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,a brilliant effect...^^

"Apr 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The Lord of the rings:The Two Towers can only be explained in one word, beautiful.This film left me breathless. I was hoping for a film that could stand in the same depths of the Fellowship of the Ring,and I must say that it has surpassed the film completely.I will have a hard time watching the Fellowship and seeing the ending, knowing there is so much more waiting.Let's start with Gollum. Gollum gave an astonishing performance.The poor misunderstood beast, or the darkened soul creature whose cares are only based on the One Ring.The performance given in CGI is at times very human. The facial expressions given could strangely give this character a personality as you would see in any great actor. Gollum's voice is still haunting, even when the beast appears to be the loving guide to the dark gates of Mordor. For these reasons and more, Gollum has become my favorite character in the film This movie honestly moved me further than I thought any film could.I could see my face and the emotion I felt as I was watching this mammoth film. Peter Jackson has truly given us all a gift of a magnificent. This story has captivated my heart, and the film has taken my breath away.There is no words that can express the greatness of this film!!!!"

"Apr 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,The best of the series.
"Apr 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Part II
Frodo and Sam split from the rest of their group to trek to Mt. Doom alone.  Meanwhile, Aragorn, the dwarf, and the elf, run to rescue the screw-up and comedy relief who've been kidnapped and are being taken to Saruman.  Gollum is introduced, trees walk and talk, Gandalf is white, and it all culminates in a siege of the mountain fortress of Helms Deep by an army of orcs numbering in the thousands.

All the superlatives heaped upon ""The Fellowship of the Ring""  also belong to this second chapter, but with the addition of a few relatively insignificant quibbles.  ""The Two Towers"" is slightly hindered by the divided nature of the story, and doesn't quite have the drive of its predecessor, but it still succeeds at being a vivid, fully realized, eye-popping entertainment."

"Apr 23, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Co-writer and director Peter Jackson continues his Oscar-winning, box-office blockbuster adaptation of the classic fantasy novel from author J.R.R. Tolkien with a second installment that plunges the fictional setting of Middle-earth into a vicious war. Welcome additions to the action in the sophomore adventure include the CG-created Gollum, moving front and center as a major character who is simply amazing in his ability to entertain and move the viewer emotionally. The most pathetic creature in the trilogy, he's a schizophrenic nightmare but heartbreakingly human and poignantly, dazzlingly realized by a combination of actor Andy Serkis's physical skill and Jackson's special effects experts. Gollum puts the similar Jar Jar Binks character of the second Star Wars trilogy to shame. Also thrilling are a climactic battle between Ents (living ""trees"") and the evil wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) that brings to mind any number of breathtaking sequences from The Wizard of Oz (1939), and the final clash between humans and invading enemy forces at Helm's Deep, a lengthy but thrilling clash of bows and shields that recalls the superb fight sequences from Braveheart (1995). Less persuasive are some storytelling elements that fall victim to the filmmakers' effort to condense the story into a three-hour running time: several gaps in the action occur and a few developments are left unexplained or vague, such as how the forces of Ãomer (Karl Urban) grow from a few dozen to thousands, how the defenders of the realm of Gondor manage to defeat their attackers, why the Ringwraiths have suddenly switched mounts from horses to dragons (why did they use horses at all in the first film?) -- and why Tolkien felt the need to give every location, character, and object in his work at least three utterly confusing names (those who haven't read the books may be left wondering what the difference is between Ãomer and Faramir or Gimli and Grima). However, the simple fact that a novel as dense and detailed as this one hasn't been turned into a labored bore is a miracle; that Jackson has fashioned such a triumphant success is a real artistic achievement. Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) may be imperfect in its occasionally frustrated effort to squeeze every significant plot element into the mix, but it's a visual marvel and a definite raising of the artistic bar for its entire genre. No filmmaker will ever be able to create a sci-fi or fantasy epic again without comparison against it."
"Apr 22, 2009",NEUTRAL,still funny but starting to become heart-warming

"Apr 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Gollum/Smeadel was the high-point of this film (and yes, he DOES look like a pissed-off John McCain).  As with the other ""LoTR"" films, it was very well-made with great special effects and shit.  Still, this film was too damn long (especially the battle scene) and (unlike the others) I found this one to be confusing and a bit inpenetrable.  By no means a bad film, but that said I couldn't wait for it to end."

/profiles/nxyIDdFpvfGkswRSaGHo0IdBhAg,NEUTRAL,"Again brilliant. To be able to maintain so many stories without any of them losing their impact is genius. Jackson also managed to keep 2 battles going as well, those of Isengard and Helms Deep. The enormity of the battles are captured by the amazing work of the Weta workshop and the passion drawn out of the actors by Jackson. All is now set up for the climax."
/profiles/dQRueLTmquL2uzlTD0Fk4HXrsKR,NEUTRAL,one of my favorite of the trilogy
/profiles/RkVuJGTlYFYyFn8u4euQrfBYfAN,NEUTRAL,"The high water mark of the entire Lord of the Rings series arrives at the Battle for Helm's Deep, which has become the standard by which fantasy and sci-fi films will measure their sprawling epic scapes.  Even in the largest battle one could ever conceive, Jackson provides us with characters like Theoden and Aragorn... deep, well-defined, and even in the midst of million-man frays, articulate in motive and desire.  Two Towers is all about transition: from the small beginnings in Fellowship to the grand-scale wrap-ups of Return, Two Towers succeeds in the most ignoble pursuit for a mid-trilogy film: getting from Point A to Point B without losing momentum."

/profiles/2dNuWzTZpfnxf9XIeRFgah14TxA,NEUTRAL,"Second of Peter Jackson's adaptations of Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy and another masterly use of CGI and special effects.   ""The Two Towers"" sees Frodo and Sam pursuing their lonely quest  -  the intensity of their isolation and claustrophobia of their peril is handled with sensitivity and dramatic conviction.   They will be joined by the tragic Gollum / Sméagol  -  an iconic piece of special effects given great humanity by Andy Serkis.

The other members of the Fellowship of the Ring are left to go their own ways and fight their own battles.   Jackson balances the main plot with intense and gripping sub-plots, his characters benefiting from a superb ensemble of actors.   Brad Dourif gives us a loathsome, manipulative Wormtongue, Bernard Hill a troubled Theoden, and Miranda Otto as Eowyn is a woman surely any romantic hero would fall in love with?   Surely?

It's a blend of stories and characters which holds your imagination and emotions in a relentless grip  -  a tribute to Tolkein's ability to write a story, and Jackson's skill in transferring this to film.   The special effects are essential to the film  -  Tolkein could rely on the reader's mind to do the job.   Despite having read the books three times before the films were made, I had no difficulty adapting my imagination to Jackson's  -  it is a mark of his success as a visionary film-maker that so many others have been able to suspend their own vision of Tolkein's world and become fully absorbed by the film representation.

Jackson, of course, has adapted Tolkien  -  his films are reasonably faithful to the books, though there have been changes.   The films, in their own right, become convincing portrayals of a mythical world consumed by the battle between good and evil.   The combination of special effects and landscape make the three films visually stunning and amplify the drama.

I have to say this is a film best experienced at the cinema  -  make sure you see it on the big screen at least once if you want to fully appreciate its epic power and drama.   If you watch it on DVD, go for the extended version with its outstanding addition of extras (commentaries on the film, interviews, making-of documentaries, and more)  -  exceptional value."

/profiles/ej0uyliGRSxbTqeSGpsgvuwpfXx,NEUTRAL,the extended cut is superior to the theatrical version
/profiles/BQJIK0ue1SgOIrxf9gFAzT1DFV1,NEUTRAL,Much better then the first one. It had more fighting scenes in which I love! I absolutely loved the trees and how they destroyed the ork's. I enjoyed this one. Story was better. Just some reason I don't like the interaction of Arwen and her family. It bores me. But the prettiest I've seen liv tyler. Good one!
/profiles/dQRueLTmWTLDszgFDOTkefX9FK2,NEUTRAL,"Best sequel ever!!! Once agian Jackson has brought us something to keep on loving, and that's the journey he didn't finish yet. 3 different plots now. And all of them just bond together to create a real great story, i must say it's not easy to make an inbetween film it's jsut not. But it's done,the additions to the film are Rohan and it's people, the battle of Helm's Deep which will make so many computer geeks of RPG games proud, Walking talking tree like Ents and the revelation to mtion capture GOLLUM. Who by Andy Serkis brings a creature whom we've never seen before with such emotion and depth. It's just great, the return of Ganadlaf the White now thats somethong to be excited about. The sotry, the actors, the new sets, the visual effects everything just keeps getting better and better. I love it. This is movie making at it's best. I really say though it was wise for Peter Jackson not to put all of the 2 towers in and put in return of the king. Reallys smart. The end is jsut os heartfelt and the actor who i really think makes the journey from the beginning to the end in such a very bug way is Sean Astins character Sam who at the end has a paragraph where he tells the audience of what those fairy tales and childrens stories really were about and gives us a new light into what the story really is about. Also not to mention Gollum really sends a chill down our spine in the end. A wonderful sequel and a really good follow up. Congrats Peter. Also for those out there take a look at the extended cut i guarntee you its worth it, so worth it. More laughs from Gimli and Legolas."

I was hoping for a film that could stand in the same depths of the Fellowship Of The Ring, and I must say that it has surpassed the film completely. Gollum gave an astonishing performance. The poor misunderstood beast, or the darkened soul creature whose cares are only based on the One Ring. The performance given in CGI is at times very human. The facial expressions given could strangely give this character a personality as you would see in any great actor. The extended version is better than the original, but does not need to make such a quantum leap as Fellowship managed with its EE. However it will be a film that is seen as a landmark in cinema."

And although there is no beginning or end, this is a neat package as long as you are not looking for conclusion. It has a great arc and the most exciting army battle I?ve seen. The effects are great and rarely distracting, which is all I really ask for from CG movies ? when they actually look good as CG, that?s just extra. Even the trees, which I thought looked really cheesy at first, works out at the end. It made me expect a lot of the last one."

The soundtrack even better."
/profiles/42wUVruk8TLysXjSxbSXesLmSPG,NEUTRAL,"The middle of the film, and apparently was the toughest to make (according to the special features).

The action is intensified, and for the better. The visual effects are friggin' amazing, possibly the best I've ever seen, and increase the scope of the film a lot and for the better.

Despite all it's visual greatness, the characterization takes a slight fall. A billion (give or take a billion) characters are introduced and you're watching three stories at once, which is awesome that they pulled it off, but I feel Viggo, Orlando, and Rhys-Davis plot line took a hit in characterization (in the fact that they don't develop anymore than they were in the first film) which isn't ""bad"" but is the negative point of the film. 

Again, like the first, the extended edition adds more to the story and character backgrounds, but sacrifices pacing. Thankfully the action and ""badassery"" makes up for it."

/profiles/0x6umkiAWhZbhnMFpmi6mI4rheZ,NEUTRAL,"Okay, I have never read the Lord of the Rings all the way through... There, I said it!!! It humbles me to admit, but it's the truth. I didn't study it at High School, nor was it a book that my parents pushed on me when I was younger.  I knew very little about Tolkiens epic books, I have every intention of one day reading all three.  But... why do I feel compelled to tell you this? 

Because that is exactly why Peter Jacksons cinematic masterpiece works.
For me (like many) who were unfamiliar with the story of the journey to destroy the one ring. I had my eyes pulled open from the first teaser trailer being released.  Something told you that this would be special, in a time when very little falls into that category.  It captured my imagination and opened my eyes to a story that I had little time for before Peter Jackson embarked on making these films.

I don't regard Lord of the Rings as a trilogy, I see it as one nine hour epic film. A magnificent film-making achievement that I genuinly believe will never be replicated. It's superbly directed, the acting is faultless, the story compelling, the New Zealand scenary is breathtaking. The films are simply ... perfect."

Gollum was a little disappointing because I depicted his voice to be completely different, but Andy Serkis does a good job.  This is where the graphics really pick up in the trilogy and I think they did a good job on the ending seeing as how in the book it left off with Shelob's lair which I think would have thrown off the ending overall for the movie."

The extended cut is a must-see (as is the hilarious easter egg).  Emilliana Torrini's haunting closing song is massively underrated and should have gotten an Oscar alongside Enya and Annie Lennoxs' closings."

/profiles/0xpImbFAQuZOTnMFpgh6qT4KSe9,NEUTRAL,"The film opens with beautiful scenery. We see orcs attacking villages which illustrates the power Saurman has against the breed of men. In that scene we see, two Rohan children fleeting their village and have to leave their Mum in the hope they will see her later, which they do, which is quite touching. Peter Jackson, the director, makes us hate Theodenâs aid as he plots to get the young king banished, and it works. While Sam develops his dis-liking for Gollum at the start, Frodo takes his side and is ultimately betrayed by him later on. We see new creatures such as the trees and the full debut of Gollum. The introduction of The White Wizard, effectively Gandalf, was a timely one for people who were sad to see him, they thought, die when he fall of the bridge in the first film. The music is epic once again. For me, there are two great stand-out quotes in this film: Gimli: What do trees have to talk about, except the consistency of squirrel droppings?! Rivalled by: Sam: Po-ta-toes? Boil âem, mash âem, stick âem in a stew! Iâve always liked Samâs one, but Gimliâs one I only came across after watching the extended edition for the first time. The scene with the wild riders, bear/wolf-like animals but on all fours with orcs on their backs, is epic. When the men on horses come up over the top of the mound and the music starts and you hear Legolassâs bow ping, it gives you goose bumps, itâs simply epic, one of the favourite scenes of the film for me. Iâve watched the films many times over, and never before had I found it so emotional and touching. Maybe itâs because of the experiences Iâve been through since watching them the last time, maybe itâs because I find deeper meaning in the sad moments as Iâm older, Iâm not sure. Faramir is harshly treated by his father for unknown reasons and in the extended edition, Boromir defends his brother, which Faramir deserved. Watching boys being taken from the caves to fight was sad, all the same, the build up to the fight is exiting, and the actual battle itself is very entertaining, many moments to savour. Even though Faramir says he will take the ring from Frodo, you never really believed it. All in all, a fantastic film. The usual rule that the first film in a triliogy of films or whatever is the best, does not apply here. If anything, these films get better which each one. All are five star. The film ends with another stage for everyone over, and new ones about to begin."

/profiles/apdFrDHyLsKqSreiJjfzoHPzI24,NEUTRAL,"The Lord of The Rings:  The Two Towers, is a phenomenal movie that provides a new meaning to the word epic.  Not only is the sheer scale of the movie impressive, but all of the details involved in it.  
The visual effects are stunning and are the best of our time creating some intense battles that get your adrenaline pumping. But to add to it, Howard Shore provides a chilling score that adds another dimension to the movie.  But with all movies like this one, you would expect bad acting, but no; The Lord of The Rings has good (not great) acting, and the villain, Saruman played by Christopher Lee, is haunting and I love it! 
I also believe they organized the movie very well, and some details were left out from the book but overall you get a pretty good J.R.R Tolkien experience.  My only comment would be for new comers who did not see the first one, you will have trouble understanding it because there is no ""recap"" at the beginning of the movie. 
Overall the Lord of the Rings movies in general are fantastic, each a bit different.  They have all the right elements to make some epic films and they have the greatest visual effects out there right now.  I think looking back at this film 20 years from now, it may look out dated, but it isn't just the visuals that make The Lord of the Rings an awesome triliogy."

In a nutshell: Probably the weakest of the series, but the same can be said of the book, and both are still head and shoulders above almost anything else in their genre :fresh: :fresh:
 
Quick synopsis: At the risk of sounding like a tool....Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are pursuing Merry and Pippin's captors while Frodo and Sam inch closer to Mordor and pick up a very animated (no pun intended) guide along the way. Meanwhile the world is moving closer to all out war.
 
Content: The Lord of the Rings Trilogy was widely hailed as one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time during its release years of 2001-2003. Does it hold up 6 years later?
 
Most people who know me know that I have been a fan of the books long before Peter Jackson was a household name. Tolkien's writing can drag on at times, but he is so gifted at bringing his exotic landscapes to life with his prose. He obviously had a very clear picture in his mind of what each and every one of his locale's looked like. What I would give to hear his opinion of Jackson's work, bringing his words to life. Honestly, I think it's 50/50 whether or not he would have liked it.
 
Personally, I was blown away watching Fellowship of the Ring for the first time in the theater. And my experience with the following 2 films was similar. There are very few movies that I have seen more than once in the theater. Richie Rich comes to mind, thanks to a school field trip after I had already seen it. Aladdin, too. I'm pretty sure of Happy Gilmore also. But I went to see Fellowship and The Two Towers twice each, and Return of the King three times. The first time I saw each, I think I spent so much time taking in the breathtaking scenery that I had to return to catch the details of the story (which I already knew by heart anyway).
 
I can't say enough about Peter Jackson's devotion to the fans. He refused to make the series into one film when several studios indicated interest in doing so. He pitched it as 2 movies. For some reason, only New Line was able to recognize how big the series' built-in fan base is, and thankfully they exceeded Jackson's hopes and offered him 3 films, totalling about 7 hours. But Jackson did the fans one better. He filmed hours of additional scenes, never intended to be included in the theaterical cut, and seemlessly added them to the final product on DVD in what has to be one of the most significant director's cuts ever.
 
So this time through was the first time I sat through the extended editions of all three films. Actually that is a lie because I skipped the first one because I had seen it so many times, but always tuckered out before making through the third. After all the extended editions add up to about 10.5 hours. And it had also been a while since I had watched anything but the first one. A few years probably. So here's what I found goinf back and watching these films after letting them sit for a while:
 
Fellowshipis my favorite of the three books, and the same holds for the movie. It has lost lamost none of its luster. Its heavy one adventure into the unknown and light on politics and war. We meet new species at every turn. Unfortunately I cannot say quite the same for the second and third chapters. I was able to see beyond their spectacle to a story that is terribly rushed at times, even the epic 4 hour version of Return of the King. Not that Peter Jackson had much a choice. But while first film was shortened by cutting out an entire scene (Tom Bombadil) that has little impact on the rest of the story, the other two were shortened mostly by rushing through sections.
 
Some scenes seemed a far too overwrought and subtlety was not a word in Jackson's vocabularly apparently. The casting choices which once seemed perfect at every turn, showed their seams, although I can't really come up with any suggestions for improvements. But it says something to me that very few of the actors in the series has had much success afterwards. It makes me wonder what other, arguably more interesting character actors could have done with super-earnest roles like Faramir, Arwen, Eomer and even Frodo.
 
Not being much of an action junkie, rewatching the epic battle scenes didn't approach witnessing the spectacle for the first time, and at times really frustrated me, especially when Legolas was doing things like sliding down a staircase on a shield while shooting arrows or climbing up the arrows stuck into a giant elephants hide as it stomps through a heated battle. It was just showing off special effects, and I'll take my movie without it thank you very much. If I wanted those kind of things, I'd rent a Jet Li movie.
 
I'm aware that I'm giving the impression that I didn't like the movies. That is far from the truth. They just weren't quite as good as the 9 rating I had once given them and I am being extra-critical since it is one of my favorite books. But of course the things Jackson & crew got right are too numerous to count. Probably his greatest victory was one of the easiest things to screw up: Gollum. Probably one of the most challenging characters to bring to life in the history of cinema. the CG is not quite perfect, but it's damn close. And 10 minutes into the second film, you forget he is a CG creation and think of him as if he were flesh and bone like him companions. And of course Andy Serkis's voice work was fantastic.
 
I'm going to end this before I drone on too long, but I just saying the second and third films aren't as perfect as I once would have claimed. It's a very impressive interpretation of an expertly written book, but I'm really not sure that it stands on its own too well. a decade from now, when I want to revisit the story, I will want to pick up the book, rather than the DVDs.

The story progresses at a nice pace, and Peter Jackson manages to juggle between three plot strands effortlessly.

Second viewing, and considering as the second installment in a three part story it has no definitive beginning or ending, this is still quite excellent. The battle for Helm's Deep alone is masterful filmmaking."

/profiles/nxNuDMfpNsGJSwafaeIo0IdZTAX,NEUTRAL,Two Towers carries the burden of being the middle of a single story but in many ways it is the most satisfying chapter in the trilogy. Relationships are deepened while new characters are introduced and the battle sequences and visual effects are very impressive. It also marks the true entrance of Andy Serkis in his unforgettable turn as Gollum and the march of the Ents will send chills down the spine. Seek out the superior extended cut.

/profiles/WYlu8yiDVFGvF9wiW6s89SRwuG8,NEUTRAL,"What George MacDonald's PHANTASTES was to C.S. Lewis, THE LORD OF THE RINGS has been to me. My parents tried heroically to make a reader out of me, but it was not until my fifth-grade English teacher began reading aloud from THE HOBBIT at the end of her classes that a book genuinely ignited something inside me. I persuaded my mother to buy me a copy which I devoured almost overnight. Then, discovering it to be a 'prequel' to a larger work, I ploughed through J.R.R. Tolkien's three-volume masterpiece with more enthusiasm than true comprehension. Since those days I have read it at least a dozen times, on my own or aloud to my wife; I own cassette and CD copies of the BBC radio serial (not to be confused with the appalling 'Mind's Eye' version); I have read much of Tolkien's other work, both fiction and scholarship; and, despite the eventual blossoming of my interests in many subjects and a personal library of over 2000 books, the great epic of the End of the Third Age of Middle-earth remains at the core of my literary world, and has permanently and profoundly shaped my perspective on life and my understanding of joy, sorrow, hope, sacrifice, humility, courage, beauty, loyalty, devotion, and the simple, homely pleasures and gifts the modern world too easily throws away or ploughs under.

Like many, I felt betrayed by Peter Jackson's cinematic version, not because he inevitably adapted the story to perceived film requirements, but because he completely changed the fundamental spirit and motivation of every major character save one. Patience was reinterpreted as lack of confidence, loyal friendship as accidental encounter, bold resolution as the product of trickery and manipulation, and selfless wisdom and virtue as low self-esteem. These were not the people I knew. In Tolkien's hands, however, their great hearts had 'baptized my imagination', nurtured my soul for nearly half a century, and set me on the path to becoming a devotee of books and of the English language."

/profiles/GPDu0WtKluedS8rfwRSMmIKVTeP,NEUTRAL,"The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while."

/profiles/nxNuDASpYTG1uwqIaxsoOsd2IAM,NEUTRAL,"None of these films are bad...but there is a loss of momentum as you move through them. This film could really have been called ""killing time in Middle Earth,"" because nothing much really happens to push the plot forward. Yeah, sure big battles and orcs throwing themselves about. However, the magic that I felt in the first movie was lost to what appeard to be trying to make you feel like the plot was moving, when nothing much was really happening."

/profiles/kODIdbuqAiJ4IoNSbpFxmhQXuDJ,NEUTRAL,"In my opinion, this one outshines the other movies in the trilogy, mostly because of the intense, claustrophobic battle at Helm's Deep which occupies nearly an hour of the movie.  This movie just had the right feel to it, because the first movie had to introduce all the characters and by the end of the last movie I was just looking for the series to come to a final resolution.  This one solidified the series as a trilogy to be respected."

/profiles/x9juVeiOKSNmsrdSyqFweSWDsjg,NEUTRAL,"The second installment on this mammoth epic works well as a second act. Following at least a couple of the Greek tragedy elements, the movie has a faster pace than the original. Peter Jackson understands the 'sequence' in the trilogy and creates a second act filled with plot development and character development. He even inserts a new treacherous character with soliloquies delivered towards the audience.

Since the plot is stretching the characters, some of the actors have the chance to stretch with. It is in this second act that the audience is able to realize the 'completeness' of his vision: to shot the three films once and for all. From the beginning of the movie, Jackson does not miss a bit from the previous movie, he picks up the action immediately after without any preamble. This provides seamless continuity for all the actors, and for the audience to understand the arch of the story. Also, we are able to expand on the visionary task for the movie as a whole.

Visually, New Zealand provides Jackson with a marvelous backdrop for Middle Earth, and although it relies on animation, some of the 'old' style movie making, gargantuan sets up in the mountains, give a greater scale to the movie. Jackson is impeccable at creating a world, and visuals, to match that world.

Recurring actors perform in front of the camera with continuity, specially Viggo Mortesen, Orlando Bloom, and Elijah Wood in main role of Frodo. Ian Mckellen returns, more powerful, as Gandalf. New to the action are Miranda Otto as Rohirrim and a 'digitized' performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum/Smeagol, who not only provides the voice for the characters, but some of the basis for his digital movement."

/profiles/9XluB9iMRS1rSwNuqVTGrfbRu8B,NEUTRAL,"Seriously, I never thought a movie could get better than the Fellowship of the Ring, but it did. This movie should be #1 on the IMDb top 250. This movie, as long as it was, captivated me from start to finish, and those who are not entertained by this movie can not be entertained period.

Yes, I have read the book. Any chapters cut out at the end of books III and IV will probably themselves in the next installment. If you haven't noticed, the beginning of the Two Towers was actually closed the Fellowship of the Ring on the big screen.

Gollum was a CG masterpiece. He added some light to this incredibly dark movie. At the same time, there are areas where you feel sorry for the poor guy, or just want to kill him. Smeagol was probably the most diverse character I've ever seen.

Elijah Wood put on a better performance than he did in the first movie, as did Sean Astin. Ian McKellen, who captivated us in the last movie, captivated us even more in this one. Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys-Davies, and Orlando Bloom made a great trio. They laughed together, cried together, prospered together, and suffered together. This trio gave life to Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas. Eowyn expressed her emotions clearly through Miranda Otto.

The music need not be discussed. Its greatness speaks for itself.

Favorite Scene: The Battle of Helms Deep. Possibly the greatest scene in the book, 50% of the trailer, and action packed climax to this beautiful movie.

The movie, like its predecessor, fails to bring us closure, but that's ok. Closure will come next year. I look forward to the Return of the King.

The Two Towers is now my favorite movie of all time.

The scale is broken. 10 is not a capacity sufficient enough to hold this movie... my movie... my... precious..."

/profiles/WYlu8yiDwIGOI9GIW6s8aHR8iGe,NEUTRAL,"The film begins with a flashback set to the first film, with Gandalf battling the Balrog on the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, but this time continues from Gandalf's perspective, with the scene continuing to follow both as they hurtle down below, fighting while in free-fall. Frodo awakens from his dream and continues his journey with his trusted and loyal friend, Sam. They are then attacked by the ring-possessed Gollum wishing to retrieve ""his precious"" from the ones he thinks stole it from him. The Hobbits subdue and bind him with Sam's Elven rope given to him by the Elven elder Galadriel in Lórien. Sam distrusts Gollum and wishes to abandon him, but Frodo understands the burden of the creature and takes pity on him. Realizing they are lost in the Emyn Muil and in need of a guide, Frodo persuades Gollum to lead them to the Black Gate of Mordor.

In Rohan, the pack of Uruk-hai run across the grassy landscape with their captives Merry and Pippin. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are in pursuit, following three days of running, Legolas surmises the Hobbits are being taken to Isengard, where Saruman is marshalling his Uruk-hai forces to do the bidding of Sauron. In the kingdom of Rohan, home of the horse lords, King Théoden is mentally and physically weak due to the enchantments of his steward, Gríma Wormtongue, who is secretly in the service of Saruman. Orcs and Wild Men of Dunland incited by Saruman freely roam the land and kill the people including the king's only son Théodred. Théoden's nephew Éomer interrogates Gríma, angrily realizing he has lustful eyes for Éomer's sister Éowyn and that he is now an agent of Saruman. Gríma banishes Éomer for undermining his authority and Éomer sets forth to gather the remaining loyal men of the Rohirrim throughout the land.

Frodo and Sam traverse the Dead Marshes, passing the undead fallen warriors of the Second Age who haunt the marshes and evading a newly seated Ringwraith on his flying fell beast. Later they reach the Black Gate, finding it to be heavily guarded, (they observe a contingent of Easterlings from Rhûn arrive to reinforce the garrison) only to have Gollum reveal to them a less risky path: Sam remains distrustful, but Frodo gives him the benefit of the doubt. Meanwhile, Éomer and his Rohirrim ambush and kill all of the Orcs and Uruk-hai holding the two Hobbits captive at nightfall. During the battle, Merry and Pippin narrowly escape their captors by fleeing into the trees where they are aided by Treebeard the oldest of the Ents.

Éomer later encounters Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli and in turn tells Aragorn there were no survivors of the Orc/Uruk-hai slaughter. Upon arriving at the battle site, Aragorn uses his tracking skills and finds hobbit tracks that lead into nearby Fangorn forest. The three discover a wizard who is ultimately Gandalf reborn, now known as Gandalf the White. The quartet proceed to travel to Edoras, where they exorcise Saruman's hold on King Théoden and banish Wormtongue. Théoden is confronted with his dead son and rather than risk open war, decides to flee to a large fortress called Helm's Deep which in times of trouble has saved the people of Rohan. Gandalf leaves to find Éomer and his Rohirrim, promising to return within five days, as a strong attraction draws Éowyn to Aragorn during the journey to Helm's Deep. Wormtongue flees to Orthanc and tells Saruman of Rohan breaking from their grip; Saruman then decides to destroy Rohan.

In Ithilien, Gollum battles his split personality in an attempt to befriend Frodo and Sam and ultimately banishes his ""evil"" half. The two hobbits are witness to an ambush of Southrons but are taken captive by soldiers of Gondor. Meanwhile, along the journey to Helm's Deep, the travelers are attacked by Saruman's Wargs and their Orc riders. During the battle, Aragorn is dragged by a Warg and falls off a cliff into a raging river as the grief-stricken survivors reluctantly move on to Helm's Deep. In Rivendell, Elrond knows that the age of Elves is ending and convinces Arwen that it is hopeless to stay and should leave for the Grey Havens. Elrond shows her a prophetic vision if she waits for Aragorn, even if he succeeds in destroying Sauron and becomes King of Gondor, he will still succumb to mortality: Arwen will suffer grievously once he is dead and she is left to wither away- she reluctantly agrees to leave. Elsewhere, Frodo and Sam are taken to Henneth Annûn and brought before Faramir, the younger brother of Boromir. Gollum eluded capture and in order to save his life, is lured into a trap unknowingly by Frodo. Faramir learns of the One Ring and, seeking to prove his worth to his father, decides the Ring shall go to Gondor. In Rohan, Aragorn washes up on the river's edge and is nudged back to consciousness by his horse, Brego. Battered but undaunted, he rides to Helm's Deep, passing Saruman's army of Uruk-hai, which numbers at least 10,000 strong. His arrival is met with relief but is short lived with the news of only 300 men in the stronghold. In the midst of despair, a battalion of Elves from Lórien, led by the Elf Haldir, arrives to assist in the ensuing battle. At Fangorn forest, Merry, Pippin, Treebeard and other Ents hold a Council to decide on the roles of the Ents in the war with Saruman.

In the pouring rain, the battle of Helm's Deep begins with a flurry of arrows from both human and Elven archers cutting down dozens of Uruk-hai. Scaling ladders are placed upon the Deeping Wall, and the Uruks swarm up to engage the defenders. The defenses are slowly being breached and the enemy manages to destroy the wall through its sewer drain, using a rudimentary explosive device created by Saruman. Despite Aragorn and Gimli's best efforts, the Uruk-hai manage to penetrate the main door and soon the stronghold is overrun. In the midst of battle, Haldir is slain and the few remaining Elves fall back into the Keep. In the Hornburg, however, the Uruks have also scaled the walls, and have breached the gate, forcing the defenders to retreat into the Keep. In Fangorn, Treebeard and the other Ents have decided to not have any involvement in the war. Frustrated, Pippin cleverly takes him to the section of Fangorn Forest Saruman has decimated near Isengard. Treebeard is filled with rage at Saruman's betrayal and commands all other Ents to seek vengeance. The Ents gather and embark upon 'the Last March of the Ents'.

Meanwhile, as the Keep is now under attack and realizing Gandalf's words before he departed, Aragorn and the rest make one last gallant ride on horseback to attack the Uruk-hai army, in a desperate bid to allow the Rohirrim's women and children to escape. As the riders are surrounded and all seems lost, Gandalf, Éomer, and two thousand Riders of the Rohirrim arrive to push back the Uruk-hai into the just-arrived forest of Huorns outside of Helm's Deep. Elsewhere, the Ents also attack Isengard, tossing stones and rocks while collapsing a dam to flood its surroundings.

At the ruins of Osgiliath, Faramir and the Hobbits are confronted by a Ringwraith and its fell beast. With the help of Sam, Frodo narrowly escapes the Ringwraith's efforts to capture him. Sam narrates how the story must go on and how they should keep pressing forward as Faramir decides to free them to finish their quest. Gandalf and the others now know a full war is inevitable (as Sauron will surely seek retribution for the defeat of Saruman) and hope rests with Frodo and Sam, who have resumed their journey to Mordor with Gollum. Accompanying them once again and having felt betrayed after his subsequent mistreatment by Faramir's men, Gollum's darker nature returns and decides to reclaim the ring by leading Frodo and Sam to ""her""."

/profiles/9XwIBNuMnh1gHw0sqmuGYhbVf8P,NEUTRAL,"This is the best movie of the trilogy. The extended edition clocks in at just under three hours, and it never stops. The action moves briskly from scene to scene and the production and acting are very well done for the most part. The only drawback is that, in a film, there is no space for interior dialogue or narrative as there would be in a book to further explain Tolkien's characters and mythology. As a result, the uninitiated should follow the story very closely, as all the characters (especially similar looking long-haired, bearded white men) and quick editing back and forth make for some confusion. Still, ""The Two Towers"" is one of the best fantasy films ever made, and does a fine job of striking a balance between staying loyal to the source material while keeping itself accessible to a general audience."
/profiles/WYlu8bSDGsGeH9MhW1T8eIRBFGe,NEUTRAL,"It's tough being the middle one of a trilogy (and I didn't have the privilege of seeing this one of the big-screen), but this remains beautiful and exciting for the most part."
/profiles/m8AID6ubLSaXT86hdKIQbsB9HVB,NEUTRAL,"Honestly, this is my least favorite of the Lord of the Rings films.  Don't get me wrong, it's an awesome film.  It's just that it takes FOREVER to get to the final battle scene.  And until it gets there it's all either scenes of walking, talking, trees and just very little action.  What I mean by this is that the pace of the middle 2 fourths of the film is very slow.  The final battle is very rewarding however, so in the end it all works out however personally I feel the other 2 installments are better due to consistent pace."

The only problem with this movie was that it seemed like the middle chapter of a story, which it was.  Unlike other big trilogies, ?Star Wars?, for example, there didn?t seem to be any solid sense of closure.  At least this movie didn?t end as abrupt as the last, although I held my breath as the final action sequence approached and hoped that the movie wouldn?t stop right as it was about to get good.  The final action sequence did come, and it was pretty sweet.  Also, the bulk of the CGI was pretty convincing, especially the CGI Gollum."

/profiles/YkluGbi9oS2WCgzTP1sDRf1jH6N,NEUTRAL,"Perfect sequel. Peter Jackson took the rescue to bring Tolkien's work to the screen with one of the most complex film projects in recent years. The Two Towers was the most difficult to do for two reasons:
A) For being the one in the ""middle"", it has neither a beginning nor an end, so he must engage the audience from the start and motivate the public to see The Return of the King, the final.
B) The Two Towers is the weakest of three books and take it to the screen needed alot of skill and charm and visual impact to viewers.
The three films were shot at the same time, evidence of the great assembly. The three tell the same story, the three present, and this no less than the rest: impressive costumes (especially the dresses of the Rohirrim), both natural scenery and by computer really impressive, so faithful to the descriptions in the novel... Here stands the milieu of Edoras and Helm's Deep, especially Meduseld Castle.
Drama, war, adventure, fantasy, all combine in this superproduction. Jackson once again demonstrated its capacity.
Soundtrack to a category admirable, the Rohan theme is beautiful and epic, perfectly conveying the warrior heart of this people that Tolkien translated so well in the novels and Peter Jackson in the movies."

/profiles/AlJu6LHGyTkgTpPf6VuYXiKPhar,NEUTRAL,"Despite the fact that Gandalf's return was played off as a great surprise (even though every trailer clearly showed it...) it is still an awesome scene.  Despite the fact a certain attack not existing in book, it added to the tension and the stakes of the movie.  Despite a certain group showing up to give their aide (again, not in the books) it totally makes me cheer inside!  Despite the crazy, wild dreams I have, the meeting of the Ents looked exactly how I imagined it.  But liberties were taken.  Parts of the movie do drag.  Characters are cut out, the story is reworked and stuff happens that shouldn't happen or outright don't happen.  But it all works."

And I'm not going to pretend it doesn't have its slow moments, but for as slow as those moments are, the battle scenes are as action-packed.

Let me just say that although it did rearrange how the story goes in the book, in movie terms, it still did the book justice. There are just certain things you have to do from changing book to movie to keep it entertaining on the screen. With that said, everything else about the movie just works: the actors, the battles, the visuals. Andy Serkis has definitely redefined the much-criticized animated character and made him as real as other actors in the film. I am truly drooling for the next and final trilogy."
/profiles/ZOlun1fKnsmghaXiNDSXYT0rHDj,NEUTRAL,"It's really very hard for a real Tolkien fan like me to rate this with a smashing five star. Too many details have been left out, details that would've majestically fit the silverscreen and miraculously made every tween quasi-fan seek out and actually read the entire series. But Jackson, though a fan, is but mortal and has to finish the film sometime within the century if he was to keep the production cashflow flowing. Being a geek means you have to be made of sterner stuff to be able to hold back the rage when literary masterpieces that you so dearly lust are ""adapted"" into another medium. Something. Is. Always.

The two towers between Mordor and Isengard, Barad-dúr and Orthanc, have united in their lust for destruction. The corrupt wizard Saruman, under the power of the Dark Lord Sauron, and his slimy assistant, Gríma Wormtongue, have created a grand Uruk-hai army bent on the destruction of Man and Middle-earth. The rebellion against Sauron is building up and will be led by Gandalf the White, who was thought to be dead after the Balrog captured him. One of the Ring's original bearers, the creature Gollum, has tracked Frodo and Sam down in search of his 'precious', but is captured by the Hobbits and used as a way to lead them to Mt. Doom. The War of the Ring has now begun..."
/profiles/ejzIyDuGWhxluqDHGbhgVfwpfXg,NEUTRAL,"Is it me or are Gimli and Legolas flirting with each other this entire film? Frankly, their banter gets a little annoying and took away from the near perfect Aragorn character.
However, the three remaining members of the fellowship carry this flick as Sam and Frodo are a little slow, especially pre-Gollum encounter. Once Gollum shows up...well take that Jar Jar...CGI character with bad grammar and hops around like he's on speed, yet no one hates him, see it was just that Lucas is a fucking tool.
Gollum is actually even more perfect than Aragorn (yeah, more perfect, that's a measurement). Gollum gains our empathy, he is harmless in appearance even at his angriest and he's always ""sneaking"" with unsure intentions...a little bit of brilliance here by Jackson, the CGI department and Serkas.
Viggo looks like Jim Morrison at times.
War is a really big risk for elves, If you're gonna live forever, what would make you risk that? I would never go to war because i want a better chance at living for another 50 years or so, if I had like 500 years on the line, I wouldn't fight anyone for anything, fuck that."

/profiles/KKvukqSKks6Ougxh8lI9vFkmT4P,NEUTRAL,"Okay.

Thought that the characters and acting was great the only problem I had was all of a sudden Gollum appears out of nowhere! :|"
/profiles/nxNuDJspbFG2FwRSaziojHdnsAd,NEUTRAL,"The middle section of most trilogies is usually the hardest film to successfully keep of track, being set the problem of transitioning events from the beginng to the set up at the end. Middle sections are usually composed of the aftermath of part one and the suiting up for part three, and as a result can be bland, expository affairs that leave out the fire and brimestone of either bookend film. While 'The Two Towers' suffers a little from the fragmentation of the story's focus, it is no less an accomplishment than its predessor/successor.
Jackson's warm-hearted direction still infuses every shot with a glowing otherworldliness, the mystical energy of Tolkien's world now flowing freely and effortlessly in this fabricated universe. The ensemble grows like a family coping with itself as it gets older, each performance adding or unearthing layers as new events add tiny amounts of information into the immense and dense literary world. The real show-stealer is Andy Serkis' revelatory turn as the slimy 'Gollum' arguably the most memorable and iconic element of the entire film series. Personalising everything from facial tics to that famous scratchy voice, it's a fantastic piece of acting not overshadowed even by the impressive digital effects. Though 'King Kong' was a bigger, even more astonishing effort, it's Gollum who's the foul heart of Tolkien's fantasy canon, and the biggest sleeping threat to any of the main characters.
Though it mostly sets the stage for the final push in 'Return of the King', 'Two Towers'' Helm's Deep battle sequence is the one everyone remembers. Exhausting, visceral and overwhelming, it's a classic David and Goliath struggle set to a thunderous beat and blinding tension, and it's final conclusion is almost as satisfying and emotionally rewarding as Sauron's defeat in part three.
On its own, it's not much without its brother efforts, but 'Two Towers' is more than just a simple bridge in this epic series, it's a continuation of the lush, extraordinary craft that makes the trilogy so damn brilliant."

/profiles/OyqIdvugeIraIwQIlzTBLTMGfkB,NEUTRAL,"In ""The Two Towers,"" Peter Jackson takes some notable departures from the book, most of them in order to build tension and create a definite climax for the middle movie in his trilogy.  By now it is very clear that we are seeing Peter Jackson's vision of ""The Lord of the Rings.""  Action and spectacle come first, and he certainly delivers: the battle of Helm's Deep is amazing.  At times though, Jackson seems overly preoccupied with the malevolence and disgusting mouths of the orcs and Uruk-hai."

/profiles/RkKSJdhlxuYosn8u4jhQNuBruAK,NEUTRAL,Two Towers is better than Fellowship in my opinion and it is possibly the best in the whole trilogy (It is tied with Return of The King) but that could just be because the battles in this film are breathtaking and the whole thing is completely compelling.
/profiles/WYlu8yiDOiGYh9MhWMS8quRyfG0,NEUTRAL,"I dunno. I watched all ofthem, and I never really got into LOTR..."
/profiles/WYlu84sDOiGOI9MhWdF8ZFRYHGK,NEUTRAL,"The movie follows Frodo and Sam on their quest to destroy the ring. It also has many sub-plots. The problem for the film makers, or so I read, was that the story in the book jumps from many groups of characters to another in fast succession. For instance, first the viewer is shown Gandalf, then he thinks what happens to Merri and Pippin, then he is suddenly taken to Gondor to see Aragorn and co and then Saruman and the ents, then Frodo and Sam, then he is whisked to Rohan and so on. This was done surprisingly well in the movie, so that it is not at all messed up in my opinion. 
Like in the first movie, the effects, screenplay, casting, music and action are top-notch. In the Two Towers extended collector's edition, many new scenes have been added and some have been extended. 
The scene where Treebeard the Ent comes to save the two hobbits, Merri and Pippin, from a tree which tries to 'eat them', looks like a modification of the book's event where Tom Bombadil saves the hobbits from the same kind of fate in the book Fellowship of the Ring. There was also the scene where Frodo was attacked by a wraith in a catacomb of kings, soon after leaving for the town of Bree: that scene was left out entirely but in this movie The Two Towers, there was a scene at the marshes with Sam and Gollum, where he fell into the marsh and was attacked by wraiths. It also resembled that scene which had been left out from the first movie. My favorite scene is the one where Elrond foresees Arwen's fate in Rivendell while he attempts to persuade her to accompany him to Valinor on the last of the white ships. The other of my favorites is the battle at Helm's deep where when all hope seems to be lost, Aragorn and Theoden decide to ride to meet their enemies. The film has many such great lines and moments.. Like the rest of the movies, it gets better the more it's watched. A great movie!"
/profiles/ornuDMiJYS9YhNVIeXTaKFZqH6W,NEUTRAL,"The entire lord of the rings series is fundamentally flawed. Unfortunately, my true beef with the story goes back to the books, but the movies actually make this flaw even more obvious than the book does. 
What is this flaw? The main plot of the story is BORING. You know, the plot to destroy the ring... can you honestly say thats why you enjoy the movie/book? 
Not at all, everyone gets so sick of Sam and Frodo that the only reason the movie is any good is that the rest of the characters are entertaining and the big war scenes are great. So we have a main plotline that takes a backseat to what would have otherwise been secondary or tertiary characters that are WAY COOLER and MORE INTERESTING than your main ringbearers.

Now to be fair to this episode it IS probably the more entertaining of the 3."

The battle scenes were more massive than the first one, and the peril of the story adds to the excitement and awe. The performances was top-notch, but I think Orlando Bloom's Legolas is a little bit flat and lacked something that characters like Aragorn have. One of the film's main reason for its creation is the box-office gain, but the greatness and sheer perfection of the film made director Peter Jackson far from ""selling-out"". Very far from it. The story has been modified a little to fit the tastes of film-goers who watch movies for its ""entertainment"" value, but it still contains the quality that film critics are looking for. The last hour of the film is breath-taking, as the story came to a startling, almost biblical confrontation between good and evil. ""The Two Towers"" maintains the greatness of its predecessor, and only few films like ""The Godfather"" can do that. Unbelievable."

/profiles/m8XuDaHbVTaQH8qFdNSQbsBbIVm,NEUTRAL,"They screwed up the Ents.  Too cartoony.  And I still have problems with the general pacing of the three films.  Beautifully done, though, and this film has the best climactic battle of the three (Helm's Deep), though mildly marred by a dwarf-tossing joke, and Legolas using a shield as a skateboard, and waaay too many slo-mo shots of people gazing at others' faces."
/profiles/m8XuDzSb0FaQH8pIdxiQZiBASVB,NEUTRAL,Best final battle of the series. Helms Deep was amazing.

/profiles/GPDu0zCKDseQf8rfwnTMmIKRIeP,NEUTRAL,"The fact that this moves SO far from the book really lowered the rating for me. The butchery of Faramir, the mythical Arwen sub-plot, just a lot of wasted time on a love interest that never appears in the books at all.

/profiles/GPdI04sK1feDI84IwDiMKsKmueX,NEUTRAL,"Peter Jackson did a fantastic job of these movies. What a huge undertaking. There were a LOT of things that were different from the book which weren't necessary to change. Overall, the effects were great, the characters superb, the scenery fantastic, and generally great storytelling. The battle of Helm's Deep is absolutely the high point of the film."

Besides that, the battle at Helm's Deep, watching the trees go ape shit on Saruman, everyone with their own little reason for doing what they do, regardless of what you might think of the occasional overkill on the ""noble"" and ""brave"" virtues, this is great cinematic storytelling."

/profiles/GPDu0lHKjSemu8WhwpuMXFK0sek,NEUTRAL,"My favorite out of the three. The journey has already begun so there is so slow down exposition. Our heroes are all seperated on their own mission. Sam and Frodo meet up with Gollum, a great character and one of the most interesting things about these movies. Sauron and Saruman closes in and you have an awesome Brad Douriff as Wormtongue, who takes over a diseased king's mind and kingdom. I really liked how this one unfolded. The Orcs were cool, the battles were well done, I just think this is the best one. The first took too much time to setup and the third didn't know when to quit. There are so many good scenes in this. How about Frodo and Sam outside the castle with the parade of Orcs who smell them? Return of the King wound up getting all the rewards, which I don't understand aside from lame Oscar politics, but Two Towers is the most suspenseful and emotionally engaging one out of the three."

We really get to see Andy Serkis shine as the digital character of Gollum whose obsession with the ring is so powerful that his maddening is astonishingly effective and chilling. Christopher Lee is back again as the evil Count Dooku...wait, I meant to say Saruman, and he is accompanied by the treacherous Lord Wormtongue, played astonishingly well by Brad Dourif (I was very happy to see him play this role and do such a great job with it). Let's see, a lot more characters are introduced, there's more battles between good and evil over the ring, not to mention one of THE best battle sequences that I've ever seen. This second entry definitely kicks it up a notch from the first film and leaves you dying to watch the final one. At the time of watching this, we all had to wait a full year for the next one, causing murders and riots to skyrocket, which were mostly done by me!"
/profiles/ej0uyliG0Hx2fqeSGvigbIwnhXL,NEUTRAL,"<b>Directed by:</b> Peter Jackson

""All will be sacrificed... All will be lost... Unless all unite against evil."" 
   The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers is by far the best film in the epic triology. Again we see the journey of Frodo and Sam to Mordor in their mission to destroy the Ring. 
   Peter Jackson again manages to deliver perfection in the form of an amazing movie. 
   Not only do you feel the struggle of Frodo and Sam's mission but we also witness links to the first film that make the attachments on certain characters, like Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas much stronger. 
   We are introduced to Gollum in this second installment and see one of the most visually stunning battle scenes of all time. 
   I, unlike seeing the first film, was lucky enough to see this at the cinema. It was an experience i'll never forget."
/profiles/ej0uyliG0HxdSq6iGQugbIw8TXK,NEUTRAL,"Beautiful cinematography and a CGI first.  Kevin Jackson loves his location and makes the most of the New Zealand countryside while the entirely computer generated Gollum is an amazing creation.  Motion-captured and voiced by Andy Serkis, the LOTR's crew show George Lucas how it's done.  Gollum has personality and while he never looks completely real, the performance ensures you soon forget that he's made of pixels.  Engaging and exciting stuff."

/profiles/kODId8FqPuJ4IoeTbMsxJIQLFDd,NEUTRAL,"And so, the saga continues with The Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers, and, while I would argue that this is the weakest of the trilogy, it is still an incredible achievement and an awesome piece of  cinema. Picking up directly where the first film ended, The Two Towers is able to follow three different plot-lines (Frodo and Sam, Merry and Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli) while avoiding becoming muddled and convoluted. Peter Jackson, using the natural beauty of New Zealand, lets his camera swoop and dance across battlefields and forests, giving the film a real epic scale and feel that is so rare in modern cinema. Just the perfect combination of superb writing, directing, acting, music, effects (both practical and digital), and every other area of film production. The final hour + of this film (the battle at Helms Deep) is one of the most impressive, astounding, audacious and fantastic pieces of celluloid ever made, brutal, bloody and brilliant.  Film-making of epic grandeur"

Premetto che non sono un amante del genere fantasy e che per vedere ""la compagnia dell'anello"" mi hanno trascinato al cinema di forza... la mia opinone sui fantasy non Ã¨ cambiata ma questo Ã¨ un vero e proprio capolavoro che va al di sopra di generi, effetti speciali, colonne sonore, ecc... Ã¨ tutto fuso alla perfezione, Ã¨ come quando da bambini ci raccontavano le fiabe, una lunga e spettacolare fiaba del bene contro il male, di valori umani che al giorno d'oggi si tendono a dimenticare.
Un film che consiglio davvero a tutti, per ripescare il bambino che c'Ã¨ in noi, per ricordarci che dovremmo dare piÃ¹ importanza a certi valori! Un racconto senza tempo."

/profiles/WYlu8bSDwIGJf9wiWdF8ZFRDsGW,NEUTRAL,"An incredibly beautiful adaptation of the first installment of the legendary book series. The special effects are outstanding and the musical score is amazingly appropriate for this 21st Century epic.
The acting is give and take. Cate Blanchett's small appearance in this movie is attractive, but leaves the only Academy Award winner(2004's ""The Aviator"") of the cast unimpressive overall. Elijah Wood's performance is rather weak, as he plays within a very small range of emotion. Sean Bean, Sean Astin, and Viggo Mortensen give solid supporting performances, while two of the film's cinematic legends stand out.
Sir Ian McKellen and Ian Holmes use their classically and Shakespearean trained acting styles to add wisdom and majesty to their characters: Gandolf the Grey and Bilbo Baggins. These two deserving senior thespians earn their places as strong stars in a film certainly not lacking in respected actors."

As Frodo draws ever nearer the enemy's land, his friends must travel through Fangorn forest, to the Rohirrim city of Edoras, and finally fight off the forces of the wizard Saruman at the fortress of the Hornburg, Helm's Deep.

"Oct 11, 2008",NEUTRAL,"Actually better paced than its predecessor, with the introduction of the terrifically animated (and voiced) Smiegel and the series' best action set piece (involving the defense of a castle).  Like Harrison Ford in the 2nd chapter of ""Star Wars', Viggo Mortensen became the star of this saga with his turn in the 2nd chapter as the future king.  Not quite as fresh as ""Fellowship"", but just as well crafted by director Peter Jackson."

Frodo and Sam are joined by Gollum on their journey to Mordo. Legolas, Aragorn and Gimli head to th troubled land of Rohan and Merry and Pippin travel with the living tree, Treebeard. All of the stories are linked together incredibly well, acting is a gain amazing, and I believe the battle of Helm's Deep is the best action sequence ever put to film. A classic movie. My top 10: #1"

Pluses- Nothing comes to mind.
Minuses- Cate Blanchett looks kind of bland as Galadriel, the book's focus on the wonder of the hobbits at all they see is reduced in favor of focus on macho humans flashing flamboyantly intense stares and sucking their cheeks in, the orcs look like the goblins from Legend, the time spent on fight scenes is all out of proportion to what they were in the book and anything that isn't fight scenes is cut way back, when I read the book Saruman was seductively wicked- here he's cookie cutter bad guy (I'm surprised he doesn't twirl his mustache)"

/profiles/RkVuJmflxuYRhn6I48sQqSB8FA6,NEUTRAL,still good even after 40 of them!haha
/profiles/yrluYysjgfKzFzPhPwuqauABTjY,NEUTRAL,The entire trilogy is a master piece!
/profiles/2dvIWouZNhnQh9Yue4fgOT1NixK,NEUTRAL,"The more times I watch this, the more the complaints I had to begin with seem less and less important. It's still part of an incredible translation, and although this instalment has my least favourite bits (including, controversially, the Split-Gollum conversation!), I'm over most of them now. Cos Aragorn's Dream doesnât last long, and on reflection it's actually NICE to get some glimpses of Osgiliath. Plus we get to meet Eowyn, see the Black Gate - and in Helm's Deep one of the greatest ever battle sequences on film. Two Towers, you're back in!"
/profiles/OyPudzfgouraIwxTlAHBlFMWFkB,NEUTRAL,"Probably the best of the three Lord of the Rings movies.  Of all of them, it was the only one to hold its pacing so well that even the extended edition was watchable.  Though it is Tolkein's fault in a way, the giant climax held in this film makes the third installment feel like almost unnecessary.  Of course, we'll go back to see how it all wraps up, but this film held the true emotional highs and lows in the trilogy."
/profiles/JBDuqmfvZf49fVvhKwf4LTAJsbG,NEUTRAL,this movie still had a bunch of walking i mean even the trees were walking
/profiles/ZONfnmTK4imQIadsN8HXks0QsDw,NEUTRAL,"My least favorite of the LOTR series, but still awesome!"

/profiles/m8XuDbfbZfaks8JfdxiQeHBbIVK,NEUTRAL,ehh it gets kinda boring in the middle
/profiles/GPdI0eSKDseAs8KuwRSMmIKpfeP,NEUTRAL,"Quite different from the book in a number of scenes, but Jackson has turned it into a wonderful movie."
/profiles/m8XuDbfbZfamu8bud8sQZiB9HVD,NEUTRAL,"Very epic, but sometimes book adaptions to movies could consider cutting down on the dialogue. Seriously."
/profiles/bJKuaMflQuMzhBKHGYfvRH0oSbk,NEUTRAL,The curse of the middle chapter.  Still pretty damned good.
/profiles/kOrud1fqmIJ0TorIbRIxKfQbID1,NEUTRAL,Was a great movie just is not my thing!

/profiles/RkVuJmflmTYyFnZH4WSQYFB8FA4,NEUTRAL,"i luv this film, its the best out of the three, if u havnt seen it give me ur address so i can KILL U!!! :@"
/profiles/2dNuWMfZNhnxf9JTe0igah1VFxo,NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed the second lord of the rings movie, but not as much as the first one. The director has taken a lot of liberties with the novel, some for the best but mostly for the worse (the arrival of the elves at Helm Deep, the ""revival"" of Aragorn by Arwen and the personality switch of Faramir). The battle of Helm Deep is very impressive and Ian McKellen as Gandalf is always unforgettable."
/profiles/2dvIWouZpfnkF9yiezugvS18hxK,NEUTRAL,Most variant from the books of the movies. Still rockin.
/profiles/BQJIKkFeoIgOIrwT96IAzT1WSV9,NEUTRAL,Rather have Harry Potter
/profiles/AlJu64sGyTkwSpPf6gfYGhKOFay,NEUTRAL,"This second part of the trilogy was the ungrateful task in hands: how to keep the tension up between the opening act and the grande finale. Also, as we know from the novel, there're also several parallel stories on-going and it does not make it any easier. But, I'm happy that Peter Jackson and the crew of his nicely pulled it off. The Two Towers is a really good movie and it manages to keep up the intensity against all odds. And obviously, the battle of the Helm Deep is one of the greatest battle scenes ever. But of course, this second installment is meant to be making a way for the third and the final part and this work it does in an awesome way."
/profiles/qAWuOpfpwTlosRauzrI9xsknhzV,NEUTRAL,"HAIL PETER JACKSON AND 
TOLKIEN"
/profiles/m8XuDzSbyhaJF8JfdNSQeHBMfVW,NEUTRAL,"Has no ending as I recall, but it's a great film"
/profiles/0x6umxfAWhZXInMFpKH6Xh4PueP,NEUTRAL,"Yeah, lots of folks hate the pacing.  I'm totally biased here.  But the quality of the cinematography, the envelope pushing CGI and the terrific performances here are undeniable."
/profiles/dQgIelumWTLVFz2HDOTklhXoSK6,NEUTRAL,Good film........but too long for my taste.
/profiles/1KaIePFxVTpbHxPF6oSd9h2puQw,NEUTRAL,i liked the first but lost intrest fast

/profiles/yr2IYpujoiKzFzPhPwuqmHAgujq,NEUTRAL,The best of the trilogy.
/profiles/qAWuOpfpVulMTRgHz1h9qhkPfzV,NEUTRAL,"The least of the book trilogy is actually the best of the movie trilogy.  Why?  More drama, more peril, less Arwen (no knock on Liv Tyler though), and most decisively more great characters: Theodin, Eowyn, Wormtongue, Faramir, Treebeard, and of course Gollum!  Plus everyone from the first film, including Boromir if you watch the DVD Special Extended Edition, and why would you watch it any other way??  Helm's Deep remains a stunning, breathtaking, landmark battle sequence in the history of cinema.  The final war on Pellinor Fields in 'Return of the King' almost felt anticlimactic, a rehash unsuccessfully trying to top what Helm's Deep achieved first."
/profiles/ej0uyQHG0HxAFq0IGBFgyhw1SXg,NEUTRAL,"story line is blah, but cute guys!!"
/profiles/GPDu0lHKlueQf8WhwpuMAHKpfe8,NEUTRAL,"My least favourite out of the three, but still amazing."

/profiles/ejzIyDuGRSxdSqZTGYTgJFwpfXg,NEUTRAL,YOUUUU SHHAAALLL NOOOOTT PASSSS!  Good old epic lord of the rings
/profiles/kODId8FqkTJKuorIbzuxKfQoiDJ,NEUTRAL,"The second film in an outstanding trilogy.  As is per usual, the second act ups the danger and puts our heros in some serious predicaments.  Outstanding performances by everyone, especially by newly introduced protagonist, King Theoden (Bernard Hill).  I have double good feeling for this movie since I was stationed overseas in Korea without my family and not alot to do, so seeing this twice in the theater wasn't a surprise to me at all.  Money very well spent!  This movie also introduces hollywood's first viable computer generated character in Gollum.  It has been done before, but usually with zero success.  That changed with Gollum, who is as believable as any one of his real Hobbit counterparts.  Exceptional!"
/profiles/ejzIyDuGofx4sqafGBFgDSwpfXV,NEUTRAL,"I love this movie. It is probably the least liked by fans of the Trilogy, however, I absolutely loved it. I love them all so much, and treat them as a single film/story, but when pressed to separate I choose this one. Helm's Deep is one of the most amazing battles in film history, period."
/profiles/KKvukqSKou6Ougxh81H91IkMI4P,NEUTRAL,"A very good film in its own right, but being the middle child of a series it is rather dull a times. Don't get me wrong, Jackson did all of these movies brilliantly."

/profiles/0xpImWuAmiZmFnGIpkI6Xh4Jfe9,NEUTRAL,Respect. Worst of the three though.
/profiles/42KHVefk8TLGiXqixpiXKHLmSPk,NEUTRAL,"Great. The extended edition is even better. While I think that ""The Return of the King"" is the best of the theatrical releases, ""The Two Towers"" is my favorite of the longer cuts. This is the only movie my father and I ever agreed on. That's saying something."

/profiles/Rk6fJQIlvhYMInXF4QuQrfByHA6,NEUTRAL,"It may lack the first-view-thrill and natural dramatic shape of Fellowship, but this is both funnier and darker than the first film, and certainly more action-packed. An essential component of what is now destined to be among the best film franchises of all time."
/profiles/nxNuDASpNsGzhwLiakhoyud2IAb,NEUTRAL,very slow.  but so worth it.
/profiles/ej0uypfG6uxdSqPFGmSgosweHXx,NEUTRAL,"Mooi vervolg dat verderbouwt op de eerste, knappe acties in zich heeft en goed opbouwt naar de ultieme strijd in de laatste film."
/profiles/lxMTYpugNsq6TvnHjws8JHPBSog,NEUTRAL,"the best of the 3, highly recommend this would make you want to watch the other 2."
/profiles/WYlu8bSDxfGOI9XFW1T89SR8iGn,NEUTRAL,"Drags a bit throughout, although I do love the sequences set in Rohan."
/profiles/JBDuqmfveu4XsVLfKwf4pFAJsbZ,NEUTRAL,"Not being a fan of the series, I have to respect the production value of these movies. The effects are fantastic and the portrayal of Gollum is fantastic. However, I get bothered by the overlength and the ridiculously sparkly eyes of all of the characters. I feel stupid using these reasons to dislike a movie, but overall I just have no interest."

/profiles/pZjuMKfk0SplHyvSlnfpVu0XHRP,NEUTRAL,"Loads better than the first one. The beginning was kinda slow, but it picked up in the middle with a good war scene, and manages to keep the side stories interesting-pippin and merry, frodo and sam,etc. This one even has good hunor in it and made me laugh several times, but the reason for the 4 1/2 star rating is the freaking hobbits...... I mean don't get me worng, I like the side story of pippin and merry, but frodo and sam are sooooo winny about every little thing, and half of thier adventure each of them cry wine about how they have to take the ring back, and the beggining hour is kinda slow."

/profiles/zWju4DHRLSjbH6OHJwfWKfNMFmz,NEUTRAL,"A large technical step forward for the series, Jackson and his cast are much more comfortable in their roles. However The Two Towers gets alot more hate than it deserves from the movie going public considering how much better put together it is. The segmentation of the story is most evident in this film as it is the middle point, where nothing is begun or resolved. One more thing that disrupted opinions was the art direction took a sharp dive, the setpieces were much less interesting and the broad colour palette was sharpened to shades of brown and grey. It does it's best job leading the plot into the third and final installment."

/profiles/dQRueqfmZhLrIzJIDjfkaIX1hKA,NEUTRAL,"My feelings remain the same from the first installment - this is the movie experience people have been waiting for. In case you haven't gathered, this movie is visually stunning, literally breathtaking. I mean that, some of the scenes in this film simply stopped my lungs in their tracks, shocked at the pure, enveloping beauty of the shot. Peter Jackson has a profound grasp of visual manipulation like few directors have ever had.

The acting is, as always, superb. Kudos for hiring ""actors"" not ""stars"". Specific mention goes to both John Rhys-Davies in his well enjoyed comic turn, and very largely to Andy Serkis, who was a major role in creating the most realistic and brilliantly well-performed CGI character I've ever seen (Gollum).

For the most part, and as a fan of the books, I take no offense to the slight plot modifications. My understanding is that Tolkien himself realized that visual adaptation of LotR would require a somewhat different take on his work, and was apparently open to such minute changes. There are also a few tiny bits and pieces I was disappointed to see not make the final cut, however, the extended dvd made up for that. 

In short, if you found the continual enjoyment I did with the first movie of LotR, this movie will in no way let you down."

/profiles/nxNuDMfpLIGJSwafaBfopfd4uAz,NEUTRAL,"With ""The Two Towers"", Peter Jackson faced the structural challenge of fitting three separate storylines with no beginnings and no ends into a digestible cinematic narrative. But he builds the tension equally through all the subplots, balancing suspense and exposition, right up to the hair-raising Battle of Helm's Deep. ""The Two Towers"" also features one of the best performances of the decade from motion-capture and voice actor Andy Serkis as Gollum. Serkis' embodiment and vocalization of the simultaneously despicable and pitiable creature is so astonishing and authentic, that we soon forget Gollum is a CG character."

/profiles/62JUWouY9hgOIB1F6OTr8uGku91,NEUTRAL,"Good movie...good action scenes, amazing cinematography...but no one was particularly interesting, at least in my opinion. I didn't connect with anybody, they were all overly dramatic to the point of, well, boredom. It's so epic, that it fails to show more regular life interactions, relationships, and dialogue. I don't expect any epic movie to be about much else than spectacular action scenes, scenery, and atmosphere. But when the people are just so-so, not really interesting, it's hard to get into it. I liked this movie, for all the reasons I've already listed, but fantasy characters from distant lands aren't particularly fascinating to me. There's literally no supposedly serious scene in this movie that I couldn't mock. The hobbits were all cheesy, lame, and just unbelievably pointless, not to mention clueless...and how do they not have beards like everyone else? Their civilization must have had razors and shaving cream back in the day, I guess. The whole ring possession concept is pretty unamazing to me, too...that some little ring is so ""preciiousss"" to all the most evil, diabolical, deranged creatures on earth, is pretty childish to me. But this is all my opinion...I am being very critical of this movie obviously."

Fortunately, I think that the whole means sometimes more than the sum of its parts: because of that, each of the movies is just 3 stars (too much battles and not a much original argument, by the way; it can be the first time of epic fantasy, but doesn't differ much from medieval legends or basic good-vs-evil stories), but the whole trilogy is 3.5-stars rated. Why? Because of some spectacular scenes (visual effects, yeah, but also good points in story), the character of Gollum (incredible), some strong characters and moments, and the effect that the ring provoked in people around it. These are the strongest points of a movie that, one way or another, should be done. Probably the result is the best you can take from Tolkien (even people said that Gollum character was magnified), so, perfect."

/profiles/9XluBeHMpH1LFwNuqnIGmTbgF8Z,NEUTRAL,"Easily my favourite of the series, though I can't put my finger on why. Maybe it was because Aragon's awesomeness shone through, whilst still retaining his ""Im a ranger"" coolness (That sadly left when he accepted his birthright). It also introduced us to one of the harshes drinking game ever [Uruk Dies, take a shot] and was just an all round epic movie. Still, the warg scenes gave up some of the ropeyness of CGI."

/profiles/ej0uypfGYTxKIqeSGYTgOiw2iXK,NEUTRAL,"Jackson's LOTR films perfectly evoked the visual aspect of Tolkien's work while completely failing to capture the spirit. ""Two Towers"" is the worst offender, completely revising major characters, and padding itself out with some unneccessary additional scenes - Jackson's tendency to draw things out is very apparent here."

It was much more intense in battle sequences than the first one. they also introduce a lot of new characters that strengthen the performance of this movie. So far this is the best one in the series and it is even better if you watch the extended version which adds more than 30 minutes to this outstanding movie.

/profiles/2dNuWASZNhn0T9yie0igMF1QfxN,NEUTRAL,"Set in a time of uncertainty in the land of Middle-earth, a tale which charts a heroic quest, which centers around an intrepid hobbit. The future of civilization rests in the fate of the One Ring, which has been lost for centuries. Powerful forces are unrelenting in their search for it. But fate has placed it in the hands of a young Hobbit named Frodo Baggins, who inherits the Ring and steps into legend. A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the Ringbearer as his assigned duty is to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged. But he can't accomplish this task alone. A Fellowship bands together to lend Frodo all that he needs to carry out his mission: the wisdom of Gandalf; the loyalty of his friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin; the courage of Aragorn and Boromir; the precision of Legolas; and the strength of Gimli. They are aided in their quest by Arwen, Galadriel and Elrond, whose knowledge of the Ring brings to light the true danger and importance of their journey. Firstly, this has to be one of the best sequal to any film. This film was amazing. Everything about this film was perfect. It was very exciting to watch. One of the best films of 2002."

/profiles/DG2uB0fn2T2PfDlIzOHvgsj2uLj,NEUTRAL,"""All will be sacrificed... All will be lost... Unless all unite against evil.""

The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers is by far the best film in the epic triology. Again we see the journeyf Frodo and Sam to Mordor in their mission to destroy the Ring.

<b>Peter Jackson</b> again manages to deliver perfection in the form of an amazing movie.

Not only do you feel the struggle of Frodo and Sam's mission but we also witness links to the first film that make the attachments on certain characters, like Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas much stronger.

We are introduced to Gollum in this second installment and see one of the most visually stunning battle scenes of all time.

I, unlike seeing the first film, was lucky enough to see this at the cinema. It was an experience i'll never forget."
/profiles/m8XuDbfbVTaXT8NHdKIQzfB9HVx,NEUTRAL,Picking a favourite amongst the LOTR films is like choosing which of your children you like best. The middle film is great if only for the heart-pumpingly exciting battle at the end...but there's so much more to it than that.
/profiles/AlJu6QfGyTkWipzI6ZsYlfKDIaQ,NEUTRAL,It was great but sucked at the same time because it was in the middle and you wanted to get to the end already.
/profiles/2dNuWMfZYinDI9jheWIgoH1xIxO,NEUTRAL,"The middle part of the trilogy is more complex and dark than the first installment. In my mind, it is the most satisfying, with Saruman being a fantastic antagonist for this installment."
/profiles/WYlu81fDXTGqi9AHWeu8gTRnTGe,NEUTRAL,"The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers, Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee continue their quest to return the ring to mount doom and cast it into the lava from whence it came but they still have a long way to go. The Two Towers has one of the most epic battles I ever seen. The movie is incredible."
/profiles/0x6umxfAoTZOTnMFpkI61u4xieB,NEUTRAL,very good battle scenes
/profiles/NXKuWrskMSm2soWsZmidXHqGHbw,NEUTRAL,My favorite of the three LOR films; epic battle scenes.  Great love story.  Wonderful acting.  The trees slowed down the action though.
/profiles/2dNuWASZ4TnMi9VFe6hgvS1VFxJ,NEUTRAL,Extended version is the best. Battle scenes are great
/profiles/YkluGvH9ji2Ocg6sPlhDlS1vi6b,NEUTRAL,"All 3 really need to be rated as one movie...and if you know me, you know I love them!"
/profiles/kODIdbuqmIJjfoxFbrfx4uQvhDJ,NEUTRAL,The great trilogy starts to lose it...A lack of focus on the characters - too much on key battle scenes. The Gollum/Smeagol conversation scene was a stroke of genius though..
/profiles/yrluYvfjKTKNizbiPmFqkiAzFjy,NEUTRAL,"The action is just getting started good, in this movie."
/profiles/1KaIePFxVTpAixlI6NTdjf2NTQA,NEUTRAL,good artwork...highly potential movie with stunning ending...
/profiles/0x6umJSAoTZXInxupkI6Xh4xieP,NEUTRAL,I LOVE The Lord of the Rings Triology. But I would have to say the Two Towers is my favorite. The storyline is unforgettable and you get whisked away to Middle Earth and engrossed in the lives and trials of all the characters. This is definately one of my favorites.

/profiles/yr2IYpujKTK9IzPhPafqJfAPijO,NEUTRAL,"I felt that they did a wonderful job interpreting the books for these movies. While the plot lines are off from the books and several of my favorite characters/lines/scenes are not used, I can still appreciate how well this was done. It's not my favorite of the three, and it loses major points for some things that I will refrain from mentioning (spoilers)."

The film is epic throughout, with great acting all around, but it's Helm's Deep that really puts this film over the top.  The panning shots of all the families preparing for battle almost moved me to tears, and the battle itself was the most epic event in cinema that year.  I can't praise this film enough."

/profiles/qAWuOpfp9flZHRJhzyH9zukPfz4,NEUTRAL,i think ive already mentioned what i think of these movies. great epic movies (which means long and boring at bits with amazing action scenes to make up for it all).
/profiles/ej0uypfG0HxdSqQsGbhgvuwnhXL,NEUTRAL,"One of the great works of John Ronald Reuel Tolkien made into a theatrical legend by the renowned director Peter Jackson, the movie was amazing in cinematography, characters, story revisions from book to movie, musical background, Computer graphical effects, filming Locations... it's almost ingenius --perfect.  The characters were well portrayed (despite that 90% of people think Mr. Wood and Mr. Astin are having some homosexual moments in the film), the role of Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn was the best role of all the characters (and all the actors did very well in portraying their characters).  The movie overall was breath-taking, some of the revisions were great and better than the book, although there is  one thing I have in mind to criticize it... A lot of important characters from the books were missing, such as Tom Bombadil, Gwahir Windlord should be talking to gandalf (he is the large eagle that rescued him twice (in the Fellowship and Return of the King), Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth was not there as well.  I think these missing characters were a good part of the movie, but they were crossed out for some reason.  So if you read the books first before watching the movie, you'll be quite disappointed in some way, or you won't find the movie surprising anymore because you know what's going to happen already!"

/profiles/m8XuDbfbmsaXT86hd8sQ2TBLsVa,NEUTRAL,"I treated my first viewing of the first Lord of the Rings film, The Fellowship of the Ring, as an obligation as a movie buff. If a movie hits it big, I feel obligated to see it, because if you have a reputation as such a connoisseur of cinema, people don't trust your opinion once they find that you've seen so many movies, so you claim, but you haven't seen Lord of the Rings. Before I saw the second time I saw the first Lord of the Rings film, I would say that fantasy and sci-fi hardly ever slay me, much less those grand epic battle films, but after awhile, I've really grown to like them a lot. I liked very much The Fellowship of the Ring, and have cleaned my palette since then with Roman epics, fantasy films, and others in that vein, especially the ones the extensive running times, because those feel bigger and more grandiose. So I decided to, very very late in the game, complete the already classic trilogy, and upon watching this second one, with my newfound optimism with its placements in genres and subject matter, I somehow felt a mixture of my feelings upon watching the first film the first time, with great cynicism and obligation, and the way I felt the second time.

I wrote in my review way back when I re-watched this film's predecessor, ""Despite having never read a syllable of any of J.R.R. Tolkien's work and knowing jack about elves, halflings, hobbits, and orcs, I was perfectly able to appreciate Jackson's passionate adaptation. It is an epic with effective moments of suspense, atmosphere and action. No, I am not a fan of the dialogue that, to me, plagues the majority of fantasy and sci-fi films. You know, the pseudo- medieval, artificially dramatic semantics that can very easily tune me out of a film because of how wooden even the finest actor can't help but be when speaking that way. And no, the wardrobe of these films don't do much for me, either. However, these components come with the territory, and I can tell that recollection of the movie will carry on and taper off in a span of days, which is a good sign."" I should've felt that way about its sequel, but unfortunately I did not. The same old cynicism and anticipation for the final credits returned from all that time ago when I first saw the first film.

The dialects and rhetoric did aggravate me this time. I could not get past them this time around. I simply couldn't reach a logical conclusion as to why people in these films speak in such ridiculous ways that I've never heard of anyone from any culture speaking before. For instance, no one uses contractions, never once saying ""didn't"" or ""can't."" This is a small example. When things like this come to mind when listening to these characters, I only begin to wonder why they speak this way. Why do some characters speak in variations of English accents and others speak in American ones? Is this a question answered in the books? Perhaps I should've read them before seeing these films, but many fans have yet to read them, so I figured I would be fine. Does one have to go through such an effort to enjoy a film? An adaptation is not meant to be delivered in a way where the audience is expected to reference the book. But, for the sake of the film's logic, I hope that there is reason given in the books for Middle Earth being so ambiguous in its dialect and rhetoric uses. The biggest, and perhaps most legitimate, complaint of mine is the completely unrealistic way I've spoken of but haven't yet explained. You know what they do: They begin speaking very loudly, then come very close to the listener's face and begins speaking in a whisper, then walks away as if it's not natural to expect a response from them. And the listener simply stands, studious and greatly effected by their words. I could go on and on, but in the interest of time, I'll move on.

The battle sequences were surprisingly unimpressive to me. There was no intensity. The camera-work had a very point-and-shoot style. The dwarf's moments during the climactic battle, his heroic comic relief, is very corny and unneeded. As I watch, I see how everything is a soundstage mechanism. I felt that the violence in the first film was much better portrayed.

What I liked about this film was the plot strand involving Gollum, Frodo, and Sam. I felt compassion for Gollum, an uneasy, not entirely entrusted compassion, and enjoyed his development as a point of mystery between sympathetic character and antagonist. I also liked the cinematography outside of the battle sequences. Just as I did in the first movie, I love the atmosphere depicted in the fictitious villages and locales, and I love the Gothic and extravagant use of lighting. During the climax, even though I was disappointed in how unriveted I was in the battle, I enjoyed the concept of all the culminations of all joined characters from all plot strands progressed over the course of three hours finally clashing together.

I did not dislike this film, but I could add The Fellowship of the Ring to my movie collection and would refuse to allow this sequel to be apart of it. I simply don't think I could watch it again. I hope the third one is the astonishing achievement it's cracked up to be."

The direction was very good, once again props to Peter Jackson for a job well done. The acting was again brilliant, with Elijah Wood's big eyes revealing every emotion. And, of course, this film saw us introduced to Gollum, which is one of the best characters I've seen in a long time. The effects were very good overall, but I could see through the scenes with Merry and Pippin travelling with the trees.

I think the screenplay was the only thing that let it down. Either that, or there was a naturally weaker storyline compared to that of FOTR. I found the overlong fight scenes were there purely to make up for the lacking plot. I also wasn't a fan of the somewhat cheesy shots of light coming from behind various characters. I also didn't like the new Gandalf that much. I liked him better when he wasn't portrayed as a living god.

Overall, a fairly apt sequel, but not up to the original's reputation.

But considering how great all the movies are (Even this one.) it doesn't really matter. The actors are still in top form and Jackson still brings his A-game but it seems as if, after the success of ""Fellowship,"" New Line was struck by the success of this series and started trying to make it appeal to a younger, more modern audience, which was just stupid considering it already did that perfectly. (If you don't call Legolas skateboarding down a flight of stairs on a shield appealing to the younger generations I don't know what is.)

Viggo Mortensen is my fave actor in it, playing  the part of Aragorn really well.

/profiles/WYJI8OuDwIGeH9AHW4I8JhRgIGW,NEUTRAL,Pretty well done.  A step up from the first in that it contains more epic scenes and of course the Ents were cool.  A step back in that I always thought the idea of the fellowship and that quest was a much better storyline than when everyone went their own way.  Better than the third in that it doesn't ever feel like its hopelessly dragging.  Good sequel.

/profiles/apdFrDHyLsKOsrQfJmizyuPOf2z,NEUTRAL,"Peter Jackson strikes yet another target with The Two Towers. This movie had nothing missing and is great entertainment. This had way more action sequences and much more crazy looking visuals that will make you ooh and awe for the entire movie. This movie was a huge improvement from the Fellowship of the Ring. I know that the first book doesn't have that much fighting and more adventuring, but there was something missing of the entire outcome of it. This movie does not. It is fully polished for perfection and is great eye candy. The Battle at Helm's Deep will make you sit on the edge of your seat and stare at the crazy looking visuals and explosions. The Raid of Isengard will do the same. Both will make you smile at how good Peter Jackson has brought this great book to the big screen. This movie is one of the greatest movies ever made."

There is more than one group to follow now and the story lags a bit, a lot of talking and not as much action. It was still good don't get me wrong. The Battle, oh the battle!

Plenty of story, comedy, ass-kicking battles & proper use of CGI to let you enjoy the fantasy, without deviating too much from the text. I didn't think they could top the battles in the 1st one, but I was happy to be wrong! Great climax for the 2nd part of a 12-hour epic!"

/profiles/orRIDduJjf9ySNkTeXTawIZVT64,NEUTRAL,"Weakest of the three movies, but it's still fantastic filmmaking.  This is where they make the transition from adventure film to war film.  They changed a lot more stuff this time around, and while I can see why they did it, it still bugged me (mostly Faramir).  Anyway, after some time, I've learned to deal with it.

Considering they had to make a movie with no beginning or resolution, this is a vrey good film."
/profiles/AlJu6DSGwFkwSpOh6lSYbsKAia4,NEUTRAL,"A decent follow-up to Fellowship. It tends to meander a bit, as does the novel, and Jackson invents pieces of stories solely to keep Liv Tyler on screen. Not as good as the first, but still darn good."

Two things make this piece---it is not its own film; it is the middle of one ten (or twelve) hour movie---remarkable on its own terms:  The creation of Gollum by an overachieving visual effects team and the incomparable Andy Serkis, and the clawed-out, devastating battle of Helm's Deep.

Once again you marvel at the sense of awe Jackson's dazzling visuals inspire, but this time the character's are more three-dimensional and I cared a little more for them this time.

/profiles/RkVuJXSlYFY6inLh4QuQkTBGIA8,NEUTRAL,The fellowship has split and Towers takes you on all the different journeys going on. We are finally really introduced to Gollum and we learn how he is very much two personalities wrapped into one. Helm's Deep battle is epic. And the ending is quite a cliffhanger.

PJ dumbed down Legolas and Gimli's relationship and made it too ""modern"" when it should have been encompassed in its own medieval fantastic world. Legolas as Captain Obvious irritated me and only served to fuel thousands of screaming fan girls' excitement. Otherwise, it is a beautiful adaptation of the story."

"Jun 7, 2008",NEUTRAL,"I think this is the second best of the three.  Gollum is amazing, and the final battle scene is tremendous.  It gets a little bogged down at times, and doesn't have the novelty element of the Fellowship, but otherwise is very strong"

/profiles/OyqIdvug2irGTwNulqIBahM8ikB,NEUTRAL,"There's a limitless number of ways one can say ""fuck you!""  I don't think there is a better one than at the introduction of this movie when Gandalf bellows ""YOU SHALL NOT PASS!""  This followed up by fighting that Balrog while falling to his inevitable doom...Dude, it's awesome.  Geronimo Mother Fucker is probably still my favorite however.

Sam's speech at the end of this I never noticed until now is really good.  I guess I was distracted by the ""weird"" dialogue between Frodo and Sam since Fellowship that everyone always notices above any other aspect of these films.  We always have to throw in some homosexual controversy over a DAMN GOOD MOVIE.

Now I'm not one of those assholes that says ""Oh, Lord of the Rings is the best, Star Wars has been defeated!""  No, I recognize that they are both great films.  Now I know many morons that say ""Star Wars can kick Lord of the Rings ass any day.""  Yes, in many parts yes, perhaps Star Wars is better, but these people also need to recognize that these movies give hope to the rest, that movie makers today can still make great movies.  Lord of the Rings is a great movie."

Peter Jackson would most likely accumulate several nicknames in the process, like Aragorn...Elessar, Estel, Wingfoot, Strider, Heir of Isildur, son of Arathorn, etc. Anyway, most excellent film."

/profiles/KKvuk0sKou6gSgeI8ai9aukgi4g,NEUTRAL,"The Two Towers does suprisingly well is continuing this epic trilogy.  The script perfectly integrates 4 different stories with ease and most importantly, created Gollum, being next to Jack Sparrow and The Joker as the most memorable characters of the 21st century.  
The soundtrack does well, boasting the might of Rohan and the malevolence of Isengard but fails on Treebeard.  
Acting - oustanding.  The Battle of Helm's Deep is brilliantly epic and utterly unforgetable.  Not better than the other two but in no way worse.  Brilliant.

/profiles/x9juVysOlINmsr9hykiwRfWKHjk,NEUTRAL,"The final chapter in the LOTR trilogy is a bit of a letdown from the previous installment. All the elements from the first two movies are there...epic size, epic battles, tons of characters and their various stories. Everything comes to a head as ""the one ring"" is brought to the only place it can be destroyed by the Hobbit, Frodo Baggins. There are those who want to help him, those who want to stop him, and those who will betray him. The armies of good and evil battle all around him, yet the fate of all Middle Earth rests in his hands. Will he be able to resist the evil power of the ring to do what must be done? What do you think. The problem with the movie, and the series as a whole, is there never once feels like there's anything HUMAN at stake. The characters are full and well rounded, but we have nothing to identify with. Nothing that draws into their struggle, and to really make us care. So it lacks any kind of emotional attachment that would have really made this series something unforgettable. Also, the biggest problem with this film is that it never knows when to end. It's no joke that there are at several false endings to the movie. It continues on long after the conflict is over, and really makes you want to say ""enough already!"". Still, it's another movie that should have been seen on the big screen to truly appreciate the skill and detail Peter Jackson put in to it."

Good sideburn rating: 9/10 Aragorn and the Riders of Rohan - no more need be said.  Presence of sartorially elegant men 8/10 Aragorn, Legolas and the Riders of Rohan - miaaoowww."

[indent]He wants the precious. Always he is looking for it. And the precious is wanting to go back to him But we mustnt let him have it. -Gollum

[/indent][b]Synopsis[/b]

The Two Towers picks up right where The Fellowship left off; Gandalf and Boromir having died, Merry and Pippin taken by the Urk-hai with Aragorn, Gimili, and Legolas in pursuit, and with Frodo and Sam making their way to the darkness of Mordor together.  Where the previous film had a continuity that followed Frodo and the Ring, this film splits into three tales with some new additions to the cast.  Frodo and Sam are being pursued by a vile creature that is known only as Gollum.  He was once the keeper of the Ring until Bilbo won it from him years ago.  Though Gollum had lost the Ring he still had a connection to it and had been following the Fellowship since they entered Moria.  Now, with the two Hobbits alone, he has his chance to take it back. 

Merry and Pippin escape when a bounty of Rohirrim riders attack their captors, the Urk-hai and Orcs. In a desperate attempt to flee, they slip into Fangorn forrest, only to meet a strange creature that goes by the name of Treebeard.  He is an Ent, a tree that thinks, breathes, and speaks.  He vows to take care of Merry and Pippin who are attempting to pursuade Treebeard and the other Ents to join the war and help save their friends, but Treebeards timeline is a little less pressing than the two Hobbits.

In pursuit of the two other Hobbits, the trio of Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimili run into their own adventure.  Gandalf is alive and resurrected into an even greater yet colder Wizard.  He is now Gandalf the White.  He leads the trio to the Gap of Rohan and the great city of Edoras, where King Theoden has been under the spell and influence of Saruman and the traitor Grima Wormtongue.  Gandalf knows Saruman is ready to launch an attack on Edoras and all the people of Rohan.  Gandalf releases King Theoden from his spell and the people of Rohan flee to Helms Deep to face a battle that is overwhelming in the favor of the enemy.  It may be the end for mankind.

[b]Review[/b]

The Two Towers has a very different feel to it than the Fellowship which focused around developing characters, relationships, and plotlines.  The Two Towers was essentially the action climax that never fully happened in the Fellowship.  With new characters entering our already complicated story and with the plot diverting into three different directions it seems like a lot to digest, but it moves so quickly the viewer moves on to the next event without having time to reflect on what happened.  When the film ends it feels like half the length of its predecessor, yet it is the same length.  This middle portion of the epic tale is more entertainment based than story or plot building which felt necessary after the Fellowship.

This film is just as extraordinary to look at as the first, but on a much larger scale.  Enormous landscapes and battle sequences take this movie to the next level of special effects and visuals.  While the art is still inspired by Alan Lees work, there is an added vastness to this films physical boundries.  With the characters spred all across Middle Earth this film feels much larger and much more hopeless.

The battle of Helms Deep is one of the most intense and technically challenging battle scenes ever on film.  The degree of emotoinal points countered with some of the most hardcore action sequences to date makes this forty-five minute battle go by quickly, but at the same time tortuously slow.  The time it takes for Dawn to come and the circumstances it takes to get there is entirely authentic.  By the time this film is over a feeling of complete mental exhaustion will sesttle over you.

[list][*]Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins[*]Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee[*]Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn Son Of Arathorn[*]Ian McKellen as Gandalf/Mithrandir[*]Sean Bean as Borimir[*]Orlando Bloom as Legolas[*]Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins[*]Christopher Lee as Saruman[*]Billy Boyd as Pippin[*]Dominic Monaghan as Merry[*]Bernard Hill as King Theoden[*]Miranda Otts as Eowyn[*]Brad Dourif as Grima Wormtongue[*]Bruce Hopkins as Gamling[*]Craig Parker as Haldir[*]Cate Blanchett as Galadriel[*]John Rhys-Davies as Gimili/Treebeard[*]Andy Serkis as Gollum/Smeagal[*]Karl Urban as Eomer[*]David Wenham as Faramir[*]John Noble as Denethor[*]Liv Tyler as Arwen[*]Hugo Weaving as Elrond[*]Marton Csokas as Celeborn[/list][img]http://i26.tinypic.com/epob9.jpg[/img]The additional characters in this story really shook things up.  Miranda Otts as Eowyn creating the conflict of interest with Aragorn and Arwen was a beautiful personal conflict.  It really makes her interact with the rest of the cast, and while you may be screaming homewrecker at her, who could deny her affection for Aragorn?  Any woman in their right mind would, and that makes her role even more realistic besides the fact that she played it brilliantly.  Bernard Hill as King Theoden is one of my favorite fictional characters ever.  The tortured and conflicted, yet strong man was interpreted so well by Hill.  He was not just a pawn in the story, but one of the most astounding performances ever.  His subtle way of exploiting his own self doubt and inner conflict without detracting from the story is pure genuis in the acting category.  Also along for the ride was the most amazing CGI character ever evolved: Gollum/Smeagal.  Never before has a computer generated character come across the screen as so three dimensional.  There is never a moment where you ask yourself if Gollum is CGI because he is so realistic.  Played by Andy Serkis, this interpretation of a character that is so twisted and demented would be difficult to pull off by your most talented actor, and yet combined with technology and the amazing voice over and physicality of Andy Serkis; Gollum becomes one of the greatest good/evil characters of all time.

[b]Ratings and Suggestions[/b]

By the end of this film you are either completely hooked and enthralled by this trilogy or you plain and simply cant stand it.  Its also rated PG-13 though is a bit more violent and even its implications more absolute than the Fellowship.  In each Lord Of The Rings movie you will get at least one hardcore decapitation from Aragorn.  Peter Jackson must have just liked the idea of Viggo offing with peoples heads.  By this time these characters are no longer just entertaining vessels telling a story onscreen, they are in your heart and mind and you really care about what happens to all of them, which is what makes Return Of The King so powerful.  Our heroes have in one way or another touched us in some very real or profound way, and that is the essence of an amazing story.  The Two Towers was the deciding factor and the result was my heart stolen by one of the greatest stories ever told.  Four out of Four stars.

This film is just as drawn out and long as the first...the only difference is that anything good that the first film had going for it are gone. This one is more dark than ""Fellowship,"" resulting in a bleak feeling overall...not a good thing when the movie is 3 hours long. The battle scenes in this movie are also considerably worse.

The fight scenes are impeccable, the romance kept to a minimum, and Gollum's amazingness abounds in the second installment of the Lord of the Rings Series. This movie keeps it comical while retaining the serious nature of war and destruction. The treants are wonderful, the sets marvelous, and the storyline, obviously is amazing. My only frustration is the lack of acting ability demonstrated by Elijah Wood and Orlando Bloom. Still, this movie is epic, definatly worth a third or fourth viewing. P.S. Liv Tyler is hot, and talented. P.S.S. Try the extended version."

/profiles/ornuD8SJDh9YhN4herhavTZXi6l,NEUTRAL,"Although the least emotional of the three movies, Two Towers had the benefit of being the best paced.  Skipping between three different ongoing story-lines gave this movie a whole different feel from Fellowship.  The epic battle at Helm's Deep was also the most grandiose spectacle I had ever seen in a film, at least until Return of the King came out next year.  What makes Helm's Deep work so well is that Jackson spends the better part of an hour building up the suspense and doom of the approaching battle, so that by the time it finally happens you are fully invested and amped up.  It's the little things like that, how Jackson spends so much time on the characters and plot, that separate this from the other big action movies."

/profiles/qAWuOWSpwTlvuR0SzgF9xskLHzw,NEUTRAL,"Where did this film fall short of The Fellowship?  I am trying to recall my emotions when I left the cinema in 2002.  My favourite scene in the book was the first encounter between Aragorn and Eomer - and I felt it was seriously underplayed in the film.  It was one of those rare moments in the trilogy when I really wished that Daniel Day Lewis hadn't turned down the role.  Viggo's low key portrayal of Aragorn was perfect for the Fellowship, but in this film I wanted to see a bit more of The King!  Perhaps there wasn't enough dialogue - I wanted more.  Also, the omission of the moving forest at the battle of Helms Deep, which admitedly he made up for in the extended DVD, did not make me happy!  Whilst as for Faramir - what did they do there!!!!????  I've listened to their (Jackson, Walsh and Boyens) justification for it, but it really didn't wash with me.  Having pondered all this, I'm thinking of taking off that half star.  But then, I still love the film.  The extended DVD made up for alot.

/profiles/m8XuDzSbZfamu8qFdNSQbsBMfVB,NEUTRAL,"<u>Quick Review:</u><p>
<i>The Two Towers</i> continues <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> saga.  Director Peter Jackson executes in this follow-up perfectly.  This film is just as memorable and breathtaking as the first one.  With the first film setting the stage for the story, <i>The Two Towers</i> was able to open up and was a little more deeper and darker than it's predecessor.  

One of the many highlights in this film was the comedic, but strong bond of friendship between Gimli the Dwarf and Legolas the Elf.

The greatest achievement in this film was the epic Battle at Helms Deep.  This is hands down the greatest fantasy battle scene in cinematic history.  It was dark and gritty... you could literally feel the fear those brave fighters felt.  It was inspiring and one of the most heroic moments in the entire saga.

This spectacular sequel is a great installment to the greatest trilogy ever made."
/profiles/1KXueqsxnhpJFxlI6Qhdjf2puQe,NEUTRAL,"a buffet of fantasy which just takes you away, glueing you to the screen, capturing all of you. this was just so much better than the first extended edition. it had so much more content that wasn't released in cinemas. i really loved the whole section on where faramir flashbacks to when gondor won a battle and boromir was asked by his father to go on the quest to destroy the ring. it tied everything together. we got to find out why boromir was like that in the first movie. apart from that, the extended parts just kept me saying ""whoa, now it all makes so much sense."""
/profiles/OyqIdvugeIrpswvhlbfBlFMAIkR,NEUTRAL,"I thought this one was a whole lot better than the first one.  I loved Treebeard in this movie.  To me, it brought more of the storyline to life."

/profiles/ejzIyPFGYTxKIqQsGpsgVfw1SXZ,NEUTRAL,This one probably has the most  poignant message due to the battle (probably connected to the dilemmas of the Industrial Age going on during the time when Tolkien wrote the books) between nature and machines. Sam's speech near the end is probably one of the most memorable and touching moments as well.

Also, the Battle of Helm's Deep scene is probably one of the best epic battle scenes ever, only surpassed by the battle scene in the third installment. Gollum is also an awesome CGI chaqracter."

/profiles/wLAu6KSmeSx0TL0uMeTvnsoaIVJ,NEUTRAL,"Totally an awesome movie by director Peter Jackson, just like the book in extended versions"
/profiles/AlJu6LHGBskBupoi60IYXiKAiag,NEUTRAL,"Director Peter Jackson's achievement with The Lord Of The Rings (LOTR) trilogy is nothing short of historic. It does everything to assure him of a place in the history of cinema for the next century. Winning seventeen Oscars in total, with almost two-thirds coming from the third installment, the LOTR series is arguably the most successful trilogy ever produced. Often compared with George Lucas' 1980s Star Wars trilogy and Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather trilogy, LOTR is in my opinion the better package because there's no 'weak link' ala Return Of The Jedi and The Godfather Part III respectively.

Jackson made the wise choice of filming three separate three-hour pictures (The Fellowship Of The Ring, The Two Towers and The Return Of The King) instead of cramming Tolkien's Middle-Earth into one long-drawn epic. The monetary benefits are obvious; in fact the trilogy has made more than a billion dollars since its first theatrical release in 2001 and through the millions of DVDs sold year after year. Furthermore, a trilogy will mean more space for the story and characters to develop. This is very important as giving the right treatment to Tolkien's masterwork is essential, not only in terms of reproducing accurately his stunning vision of Middle-Earth, but also to do so out of respect to a great literary giant.

When The Fellowship Of The Ring was released in 2001, it set new standards in cinematography and visual effects. Filmed on location in New Zealand, Fellowship features unbelievable scenes of snow-capped mountains and rocky terrain that are mostly shot with a moving camera at varying angles and heights that captures what Jackson wants - an epic-like feel that complements the grandeur of the story. Because all three films are shot back-to-back-to-back in less than three years, the photography and lighting remain fairly consistent throughout the trilogy, though Fellowship is undeniably the most beautifully-filmed picture of the trio.

I'm running out of superlatives to describe the incredible visual effects by WETA (finally a worthy competitor to Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic). It's important to note that the accomplishments of WETA are central to the success of LOTR. Peter Jackson's vision of Middle-Earth and its inhabitants owe a great debt to it. The CGI is till today the best ever created. The Return Of The King features the most awe-inspiring effects of the lot, though the CGI in the final hour when Frodo and Sam make the tortuous journey up Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring appear to be too indulgent and at times lacking in visual quality.

The battle sequences are expertly-staged and are one for the senses. Sound mixing and editing are extraordinary, from the frightening stomping march of tens of thousands of Orcs to the spine-tingling clashes of sharp blades during the much furious swordplay that punctuates the three films. Nothing as huge and large-scale as the Battle Of Helm's Deep in The Two Towers or the Battle Of Minas Tirith in The Return Of The King have ever been committed to screen. Apart from Zack Snyder's 300, there are few movies out there that are able to live up to the standards of LOTR, let alone surpass it.

LOTR establishes the careers of Viggo Mortensen (Eastern Promises, A History Of Violence), Orlando Bloom (Kingdom Of Heaven, Troy) and Elijah Wood (Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, Sin City) while rejuvenating that of Ian MacKellan's (Gods And Monsters, X-Men) and Christopher Lee's (Revenge Of The Sith, Hamlet). Honestly, there's nothing to boast about the acting quality of the cast. It is at best, above average, though it's far better that what the stars of Star Wars can offer. If there's anyone worthy of an Oscar for an acting performance in LOTR, it would be Andy Serkis (who also plays the title role in Peter Jackson's King Kong) for his chilling yet humanistic portrayal of Gollum, on of the most memorable villains of 21st century cinema.

Howard Shore's original score is nothing spectacular, though its main theme is instantly recognizable and is used with better effect in Fellowship than its sequels. Even though he wins two Oscars for LOTR, Shore lays the musical groundwork firmly and most impressively in Fellowship. The sequels offer new themes but less musical creativity. Shore shows his weakness for scoring huge action set-pieces since his roots as a film composer lie in suspense and horror (e.g. Silence Of The Lambs, The Fly).

The twenty-plus minutes ending in Return Of The King is sure to divide viewers in the same way Steven Spielberg's A.I: Artificial Intelligence did. Why would Peter Jackson wish to end the LOTR series in such an anti-climatic mood? He could have concluded the series on a high note just after Frodo destroys the One Ring. But he chooses to put in lengthy celebratory and farewell scenes because he wants to stay true to Tolkien's story. It's a fitting closure to one of the greatest screen adaptations of all time. The Lord Of The Rings is not only cinema at its most entertaining, it also features filmmakers, artists, writers, special effects wizards and sound engineers working at the height of their powers.

SCORE: 10/10

/profiles/1KaIePFx1fpDsxZT6qFdQi2NTQm,NEUTRAL,"Ah, the difficult second album. This was probably the trickiest film to make as it has to create the bridge from 'Fellowship' to 'King' whilst in itself being a whole entity. 'Towers' actually contains two books which each followed a different timeline (the first book deals with Frodo & co after they split from the rest of the group only, and then the second switches to the rest of the fellowship leaving Frodo alone for the whole second book whilst it jumps back in time to Amon Hen again), and this would not have worked in a film format. Personally I was keenly waiting for this film (as it introduces the Rohan for he first time), and was in no way disappointed. The siege of Helms Deep is epic and wonderful, and the story of Frodo, Sam and Gollum is captivating. Personal highlight for me are the Ents, superb work."

/profiles/GPDu0auKxhenF8ziwnTMliKVTek,NEUTRAL,"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is, of course, the SECOND best trilogy ever made.  This was the worst of the three, which is to say, it is slightly less classic than the other two.  Still a fantastic movie, the best siege ever filmed."
/profiles/v6VtRpSW6spnH9oTGki6VsAdHW1,NEUTRAL,"As I mentioned before in my first review:
This trillogy is so far beyond other films of any genera that it deserves another 5 stars on a five star rating system. A definate 10 stars!
   Peter Jackson broke movie tradition and did something that has never been done before in the history of film making. By shooting all three movies at one time he left a continuety and consistancey in this series that is unrivalled. The deviations from the book while they do occur are minor and the special affects have clearly placed this movie in a whole new evolution above the rest.
   The three Lord of the Rings movies stand out as unique and well made and will endure the test of time as one of the greatest movies ever made, and in my opinion THE Greatest film ever produced to date. Outstanding, and entertaining! Hats off to everyone who made and was involved in this production!"

It has a more dreary atmosphere than the first installment which makes it a 'lil more stale at times.  The battle for Helm's Deep and when the Ents go to war with Isengard are some intense scenes.  Gollum is fuckin' hilarious and he really lightens the mood because of it."

/profiles/YkRIGRF9ji20HgVuPViDlS1Of64,NEUTRAL,"The second movie in the trilogy an tons of connective tissue to make the trilogy work.  Good film again well made, great effects, beautiful artful photography but I don't buy Pete Jackson's god-hood."

/profiles/9XluBeHM6f1afwLSqxhG0IbAh8X,NEUTRAL,"Only the extended edition is worthy of 4 1/2 stars. The regular is not. But the extended is, to me, better than the first, and almost equal with the third, extended editions, of course. There's no reason to watch the originals in this case, because the exteneded ones are all superior."

/profiles/orRIDeFJgu9DfNOFeJfakfZqH64,NEUTRAL,"Not as good as the first. Solid 8/10 though. Wish there was more action. The scene at Helms Deep was seriously well done. The cinematography is amazing, Jackson is a great director. Loved the development of Frodo."

I had read the book before this movie was released and i loved it anyways. My first thoughts at that time were, ""Ok.. how could they ever make this into a movie?""
But jackson put up a real miracle. This is perhaps the only trilogy that is tiring long, but i am ready to sit through it every time... over and over again!!"
/profiles/AlJu6DSGBskospgu6ZsYlfKOFaO,NEUTRAL,"Best of the three, but still it is all over the place. It has also embarrasing acting by everyone and plain corny moments. The most interesting character in this movie and the whole series is actually Gollum and for christ sake he is almost completely computer generated. That tells something."

/profiles/aplurDHyxhKOsreiJjfzoHPLu2N,NEUTRAL,"Peter Jackson digs his heels in deep with the second installment of The Lord of the Rings cycle. This movie is dark, tense, humorless and full of spellbinding shots.  The storylines become separate as the Fellowship goes about their impossible tasks in different journeys, and as Frodo, Sam and Gollum head off toward Mordor, Aragorn and his clan have to prepare for one of the first great battles between man and orcs.  This middle piece only suffers from Jackson's ambition, as all of these threads don't fit as seamlessly. But the commitment of the cast and technical crew makes this a great bridge from Fellowship to Return of the King."

/profiles/2dNuWASZlsnds9Yue6hgMF1NixG,NEUTRAL,Two Towers is great in the fact that it weaves the first and third films together without being totally boring.

/profiles/r8OIOKFAOhGJFdQTqzFV8iGZfZG,NEUTRAL,"I guess, now that I think about it, these movies were close enough to the books that if you liked the books, you liked the movies. The books were entertaining and sometimes frustrating and tedious, and so were the movies."

/profiles/WYJI8euDPSGps9rTWXh8ZFRYHGe,NEUTRAL,"The second film of the trilogy is often the weakest simply because it's the middle.  You can't completely resolve it because there's more to come... but you can't leave it untied, either.  Jackson does a decent compromise, and that's one heck of a battle he creates at Helm's Deep.  And what a soundtrack Howard Shore has written!  They are quite a team!"

Even though this one suffers from ""middle movie syndrome"" and has the most substantial changes from the books, I love Bernard Hill, and every moment he's on-screen makes me happy. This installment also features the BRILLIANTLY-directed sequences leading up to the Battle for Helm's Deep, which are probably Jackson's best-assembled scenes in his whole career."

/profiles/ej0uyQHGvix4sqLhGBFgOiwrsXx,NEUTRAL,"The Battle for Middle-earth Begins!

Great Film! Fantastic story! Epic battles were just amazing. This fantasy magical story keeps getting better and better. Highly recommended!

The film begins with a flashback set to the first film, with Gandalf battling the Balrog on the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, but this time continues from Gandalf's perspective, with the scene continuing to follow both as they hurtle down below, fighting while in free-fall. Frodo awakens from his dream and continues his journey with his trusted and loyal friend, Sam. They are then attacked by the ring-obsessed Gollum wishing to retrieve ""his precious"" from the ones he thinks stole it from him. The Hobbits subdue and bind him with Sam's Elven rope given to him by the Elven elder Galadriel in Lórien. Sam distrusts Gollum and wishes to abandon him, but Frodo understands the burden of the creature and takes pity on him. Realizing they are lost in the Emyn Muil and in need of a guide, Frodo persuades Gollum to lead them to the Black Gate of Mordor.

In Rohan, the pack of Uruk-hai run across the grassy landscape with their captives Merry and Pippin. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are in pursuit, following three days of running, Legolas surmises the Hobbits are being taken to Isengard, where Saruman is marshalling his Uruk-hai forces to do the bidding of Sauron. In the kingdom of Rohan, home of the horse lords, King Théoden is mentally and physically weak due to the enchantments of his steward, Gríma Wormtongue, who is secretly in the service of Saruman. Orcs and Wild Men of Dunland incited by Saruman freely roam the land and kill the people including the king's only son Théodred. Théoden's nephew Éomer interrogates Gríma, angrily realizing he has lustful eyes for Éomer's sister Éowyn and that he is now an agent of Saruman. Gríma banishes Éomer for undermining his authority and Éomer sets forth to gather the remaining loyal men of the Rohirrim throughout the land.

Frodo and Sam traverse the Dead Marshes, passing the undead fallen warriors of the Second Age who haunt the marshes and evading a newly seated Ringwraith on his flying fell beast. Later they reach the Black Gate, finding it to be heavily guarded, (they observe a contingent of Easterlings from Rhûn arrive to reinforce the garrison) only to have Gollum reveal to them a less risky path: Sam remains distrustful, but Frodo gives him the benefit of the doubt. Meanwhile, Éomer and his Rohirrim ambush and kill all of the Orcs and Uruk-hai holding the two Hobbits captive at nightfall. During the battle, Merry and Pippin narrowly escape their captors by fleeing into the trees where they are aided by Treebeard the oldest of the Ents.

Éomer later encounters Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli and in turn tells Aragorn there were no survivors of the Orc/Uruk-hai slaughter. Upon arriving at the battle site, Aragorn uses his tracking skills and finds hobbit tracks that lead into nearby Fangorn forest. The three discover a wizard who is ultimately Gandalf reborn, now known as Gandalf the White. The quartet proceed to travel to Edoras, where they exorcise Saruman's hold on King Théoden and banish Wormtongue. Théoden is confronted with his dead son and rather than risk open war, decides to flee to a large fortress called Helm's Deep which in times of trouble has saved the people of Rohan. Gandalf leaves to find Éomer and his Rohirrim, promising to return within five days, as a strong attraction draws Éowyn to Aragorn during the journey to Helm's Deep. Wormtongue flees to Orthanc and tells Saruman of Rohan breaking from their grip; Saruman then decides to destroy Rohan.

In Ithilien, Gollum battles his split personality in an attempt to befriend Frodo and Sam and ultimately banishes his ""evil"" half. The two hobbits are witness to an ambush of Southrons but are taken captive by soldiers of Gondor. Meanwhile, along the journey to Helm's Deep, the travelers are attacked by Saruman's Wargs and their Orc riders. During the battle, Aragorn is dragged by a Warg and falls off a cliff into a raging river as the grief-stricken survivors reluctantly move on to Helm's Deep. In Rivendell, Elrond knows that the age of Elves is ending and convinces Arwen that it is hopeless to stay and should leave for the Grey Havens. Elrond shows her a prophetic vision if she waits for Aragorn, even if he succeeds in destroying Sauron and becomes King of Gondor, he will still succumb to mortality: Arwen will suffer grievously once he is dead and she is left to wither away- she reluctantly agrees to leave. Elsewhere, Frodo and Sam are taken to Henneth Annûn and brought before Faramir, the younger brother of Boromir. Gollum eluded capture and in order to save his life, is lured into a trap unknowingly by Frodo. Faramir learns of the One Ring and, seeking to prove his worth to his father, decides the Ring shall go to Gondor. In Rohan, Aragorn washes up on the river's edge and is nudged back to consciousness by his horse, Brego. Battered but undaunted, he rides to Helm's Deep, passing Saruman's army of Uruk-hai, which numbers at least 10,000 strong. His arrival is met with relief but is short lived with the news of only 300 men in the stronghold. In the midst of despair, a battalion of Elves from Lórien, led by the Elf Haldir, arrives to assist in the ensuing battle. At Fangorn forest, Merry, Pippin, Treebeard and other Ents hold a Council to decide on the roles of the Ents in the war with Saruman.

In the pouring rain, the battle of Helm's Deep begins with a flurry of arrows from both human and Elven archers cutting down dozens of Uruk-hai. Scaling ladders are placed upon the Deeping Wall, and the Uruks swarm up to engage the defenders. The defenses are slowly being breached and the enemy manages to destroy the wall through its sewer drain, using a rudimentary explosive device created by Saruman. Despite Aragorn and Gimli's best efforts, the Uruk-hai manage to penetrate the main door and soon the stronghold is overrun. In the midst of battle, Haldir is slain and the few remaining Elves fall back into the Keep. In the Hornburg, however, the Uruks have also scaled the walls, and have breached the gate, forcing the defenders to retreat into the Keep. In Fangorn, Treebeard and the other Ents have decided to not have any involvement in the war. Frustrated, Pippin cleverly takes him to the section of Fangorn Forest Saruman has decimated near Isengard. Treebeard is filled with rage at Saruman's betrayal and commands all other Ents to seek vengeance. The Ents gather and embark upon 'the Last March of the Ents'.

Meanwhile, as the Keep is now under attack and realizing Gandalf's words before he departed, Aragorn and the rest make one last gallant ride on horseback to attack the Uruk-hai army, in a desperate bid to allow the Rohirrim's women and children to escape. As the riders are surrounded and all seems lost, Gandalf, Éomer, and two thousand Riders of the Rohirrim arrive to push back the Uruk-hai into the just-arrived forest of Huorns outside of Helm's Deep. Elsewhere, the Ents also attack Isengard, tossing stones and rocks while collapsing a dam to flood its surroundings.

At the ruins of Osgiliath, Faramir and the Hobbits are confronted by a Ringwraith and its fell beast. With the help of Sam, Frodo narrowly escapes the Ringwraith's efforts to capture him. Sam narrates how the story must go on and how they should keep pressing forward as Faramir decides to free them to finish their quest. Gandalf and the others now know a full war is inevitable (as Sauron will surely seek retribution for the defeat of Saruman) and hope rests with Frodo and Sam, who have resumed their journey to Mordor with Gollum. Accompanying them once again and having felt betrayed after his subsequent mistreatment by Faramir's men, Gollum's darker nature returns and decides to reclaim the ring by leading Frodo and Sam to ""her""."

/profiles/ornuDYHJDh9eHN4heDHaKFZru6e,NEUTRAL,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) -- [9.0] -- The middle movie is slightly less satisfying on its own, mired in tangled plotting and uneven in its distribution of action and spectacle.  Unless you're a real fan of the story, the first two-thirds can be difficult to get through, but the last hour more than makes up for it.  The Battle of Helm's Deep and the Ents' march on Isengard are as spectacular as anything else in the trilogy.  The acting ensemble grows to accommodate new characters.  Most notable are Bernard Hill as KingTheoden, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, David Wenham as Faramir, and Brad Dourif as Grima Wormtongue.  Outshining them all, however, is Gollum.  Middle Earth's favorite split-personality is achieved through the on-set performance (and voice) of Andy Serkis and the animating prowess of WETA Digital.  The result is a CGI character more compelling than any that have come before it."

/profiles/kODId8Fq9FJKuoNSbpFxbHQbIDJ,NEUTRAL,"As I said on my review for The Fellowship of the Ring, all three of these films are epic and brilliant and I love them all equally so, but to name a few key things that I really love about The Two Towers specifically: the introduction of Gollum. We briefly see him in the Fellowship, but it's in this movie that we really come to know him and see him play a key role in the story. It's strange how you form an odd bond with Gollum. You can't help but love and hate him all at the same time. And don't deny the fact that you've personally used the phrase, ""my precioussssss"" because c'mon, you know you have. In fact, Gollum provides us with a lot of great, memorable lines in these movies and that's one of the reasons why you've got to love him. Something else that I really love about The Two Towers installment are the ents. I completely adore them, especially seeing as I already have an extreme affinity for trees. They're a magical addition to these films and Treebeard is such a fantastic character. Their appearance is something that really stands out to me in this second movie of the trilogy. And then, of course, the battle at Helm's Deep is a long and tiring one but is definitely a highlight of the movie. Especially when the elves of Lothlorien come to fight alongside man in the end. Two Towers, you didn't disappoint."

This movie is very strong, but very transitory, as it sets up lots of things for the final installment. 

Andy Serkis' breakout performance as Gollum was amazing. Something that was onyl built upoj the final movie.

It also built upon the action, with the Battle of Helm's Deep probably the most epic I've seen in a movie.

Although this movie is strong, I do think it is the weakest of the trilogy. 

Casting choices were upped with the addition of Theoden, Eomer, and Eowyn. They really meshed with the other actors well.

It only gets up from here . . ."

It wasn?t just the screen adaptation that was brilliant, but it showed his deep respect, passion and reverence for the original book. An unforgettable score, set and costume designs that literally brought the feel of the book directly to the screen. Only a devoted fan could have accomplished such a huge undertaking. Jackson found the balance between those who never read the books, with those who had. He identified specific memorable scenes from the original material (book), then accurately reconstructed them onto the screen, connecting them like pearls on a string, while adapting the story to fit the medium. My only regret was it didn?t win the twelfth Oscar to make it the most oscared film in motion picture history, and yet all three films did win a total of 17 Oscars which puts it in a category all its own."

/profiles/42KHVbHkAsL9HX4fxpiXZfLBiPD,NEUTRAL,"This is the movie that made me fall deeply in love with ""The Lord of the Rings"", this is the movie that made me realize how cool the work of a director is. ""The Two Towers"" changed me, it made me see the world with different eyes, took me on a mind-blowing trip that I'm still travelling on. This is one of those movies I'll never get tired of, no matter how many times I've seen it already. 

The best part about it is that it maintained all those good elements that made me like and appreciate ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", but got rid of all those slow, complicated things that made the first movie so 'heavy' and long. The details are still there though, and there's some character developement and some beautiul words are spoken. Toward the end of the movie, the battle at Helm's Deep and the words spoken by Samwise the Brave -- and the visual effect of having Gandalf with Eomer and his army following him -- that scene gets more and more astonishing the more you watch it. It's just stunning. 

As a matter of fact, the extended version of ""The Two Towers"" flows by like really soon, like a very light, entertaining, action packed movie. I love every scene. And the storyline is just so much more interesting if compared to the first movie; well, the way I see it ""The Fellowship"" was just an introducion to Tolkien's universe. Then it come the battle of Helm, followed by the greates battle for Middle Earth. -- 

When I first saw ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" I hostestly thought it was the best movie I've ever seen. That was before I saw ""The Return of the King"". That's the crazy thing: it just keeps on getting better and better!"

/profiles/2dNuWXsZNhnzS9XIeWIgMF1YSxO,NEUTRAL,"I considered The Fellowship of the Ring to be one of the greatest movies ever. This one is better!

The scenery is marvelous, the animations great, and the story superb. This episode strays further from the books when it comes to the unfolding of events, but I feel that it stays closer in atmosphere and realism; the nazgûls are now the fear-inspiring creatures they should be. Gollum, excellently implemented, even becomes more realistic then I remember him from the books, not to mention other attempts to portray him. His schizophrenic monologues are among the highlights of the movie.

The major drawback is once again the apparent incapability of the dark-side creatures. Aragorn with fellows can ride back and forth among them unhurt, while the Uruk-Hai fall in large numbers just for being nearby. Though I enjoy many of the jokes made at Gimli's expense, this still is another thing I partly dislike. Gimli sure is no clown in the books"

/profiles/ej0uyQHGYTx4sq6iG8fgJFwnhXV,NEUTRAL,"There are not many films which produce superior sequels. This is one of the few which do. If you thought the first film was great, wait till you see this once.

The story is a lot more exciting, with it continuing straight after the last film. The actors which brought this world to life. They all gave outstanding performances again. Brad Dourif created a sinister Wormtongue and Andy Serkis really brought Gollum to life. I feel that if Serkis didn't portray him, to character wouldn't seem as real.

All the special effects were superb. The use of 'bigatures' really improved the environment. If Peter Jackson and his team used CGI instead, i feel they wouldn't have captured it right. The CGI which was used was also very impressing. Trying to figure out which orcs and soldiers are actors and which are CGI, can be a real challenge. The character of Gollum was also a CGI masterpiece. Andy Serkis together which the characters looks, really brought him to life. 

The music was a wonderful treat again, and Howard Shore did another great job again. He really added to the characters and moved the story along. 

If you haven't seen any of the film before, i would highly suggest you catch them, as they are really a HUGE part of cinema history."

/profiles/DG6FBoHnkH21tDlIzVSvgsjrILl,NEUTRAL,"[font=Garamond][size=3]The RT anniversary trilogy viewing continues with this excellent film. I prefer The Two Towers to the first film because the story moves along better and the music, visual effects, and emotional impact are perfectly united in the climactic final scenes of Helms Deep and Isengard.
  We pick up our story with Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli tracking a band of Uruk-hai who have taken Merry and Pippin as captives back to Saruman at Isengard.  Instead, our three heroes run into Eomer (Karl Urban) and his band of Rohirrim, and he relates that the Uruk-hai were destroyed. Aragorn tracks the hobbits into Fangorn forest, and there Gandalf greets them, reborn as the white wizard. Together, the four now return to restore King Theoden (Bernard Hill) to his throne and release him from the spell of Saruman and Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). Aragorn also has a brief flirtation with Theodens niece Eowyn (Miranda Otto), firm in his belief that Arwen has left for the undying shores with her kin. Faced with war, the people of Rohan  follow their king and withdraw to the safety of Helms Deep, and there Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and a band of elves help Theoden and the people of Rohan fight the full might unleashed from Isengard. Meanwhile, Sam and Frodo begin their long journey into Mordor, guided through the rocks of the Emyn Muil and the dead marshes by the creature Gollum (Andy Serkis), who is still bound to the ring. He leads them straight to the black gate of Mordor, but then implores them to go by a back way he knows of instead. When they change their route, they are captured by Captain Faramir (David Wenham) and his men. Faramir quickly discovers that Frodo is a ringbearer and he decides to take him and the ring back to Gondor. Faramirs mind is finally changed when he sees the power of the ring over Frodo as he stands face to face with a Nazgul, and he lets Sam, Frodo, and Gollum continue on their way. While all this is occurring, Merry and Pippin have run into the ent Treebeard (John Rhys-Davies), and they wait impatiently for the ents to be stirred to war, finally receiving their wish when Treebeard sees all the destruction Saruman has wreaked on the forest in order to build up his army. Isengard is sacked while Gandalf and Eomer return to turn the tide of victory at Helms Deep, and we all expectantly await The Return of the King.
  This film has all the benefits of the first film and more. The story moves faster thanks to cuts back and forth between multiple storylines. The visual effects are simply stunning and Howard Shores musical score packs even more punch than in the first film. Two Towers also introduces my two favorite characters (and favorite storyline), Eowyn and Faramir. And  petty as this seems  Two Towers only gets nine tomatoes because no matter how many times I see this film, Ill never get over how badly butchered the character of Faramir is compared to the book. Yes, I understand that undermining Faramirs character prolongs the tension of Frodos storyline, but that still doesnt make it acceptable.
  Overall, Lord of the Rings is the worlds most amazing film trilogy, and this middle entry is an inspiring continuation.[/size][/font]

In some ways its not as good as the first possibly because of the new characters were not introduced as well and also because theres theres the need to run 3 storylines in parallel. There were scenes in the trailer that were cut out which would have worked really well in the film. Also the extended edition had some background information but also had some unnecessary scenes added just for humour. ""Gollum's Song"" isn't as strong as the previous song."

/profiles/RkwIJ6FlvhY4fnZH4jhQBiB8FA6,NEUTRAL,"Yeah, that was fun. It's actually amazing, since I don't like gory battles, and the second half of the movie was almost exclusively about a battle. But I was way to impressed with the animation to be grossed out by the battle. (Actually, I can hardly recall any blood.) The second thing that was impressive was, of course, Gollum. Looks like a new chapter in motion capture technology! I still haven't read any of the books, so I guess I am missing a lot the whole story and background of the main characters, but that doesn't really matter.

/profiles/AlJu6LHGqfkbFpoi64iYGhKrTar,NEUTRAL,One of the best openings on movies ever! First half is fun and the sense of great adventure is present. Theatrical release suffers from too much material left out to speed things up. Thanks for the extended edition. Still the end part gets tedious. At this movie i got the feeling the third is gonna be too big for my taste.

/profiles/BQJIKkFeqTgehrgu9auAOF1WSVl,NEUTRAL,"I found this film to be pretty disappointing.  I loved the books, so obviously a bit of a let down is in order, but the rediculous action sequences get to be a bit much.  Turning Aragorn and Legolas into almost superhuman fighters overshadows any interesting qualities they might have.  And again, turning Gimli into nothing more than comic relief is really frustrating."

/profiles/nxNuDJspRhGkswRSaRuoOsd2IAd,NEUTRAL,Brilliant film with stunning action and amazing effects. Andy Serkis as Gollum is incredible. Not quite as good as the Fellowship but not too far away. Gimli emerges as a great comedic character while still retaining his bad-ass dwarf persona.

/profiles/PDwfLBFMgsWkIkoH9KHLmiNoiZX,NEUTRAL,"The final hour of The Two Towers is grand, terrifying, and epic on a biblical level.

Without a doubt, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the greatest achievements in the art of film-making. The Two Towers is perhaps even more enjoyable than the Fellowship of the Ring, especially for viewers who prefer action over adventure. Epic battle sequences, loaded with special effects, are the highlight of the film. The story centers on Saruman's invasion of the human settlements of Rohan with an army of unfathomable force, driving the people to seek refuge in the fortress of Helms Deep. One truly feels the loss suffered by these people and their desperation, which leads them to enlist children to fight against the deadly and brutal army. One of the greatest achievements of this war film is in delivering the horrors of battle and pathos for the fallen within the context of myth and fantasy.

Another spectacular achievement is the creation of Gollum. This is the most life-like CGI character yet to be seen on film. Through a brilliant combination of acting, animation, and effects, Gollum's interaction with Frodo and others is completely convincing. The character is so richly developed that he is at times frightening, disgusting, pitiful, funny, and even cute. Gollum's role is central to the story and suggests that battles within ourselves may be just as formidable as any other.

One could write seemingly to no end about the level of detail in the sets and costumes, and the wonderful performances of each member of the cast. If there are any flaws in this film, they are truly small. I was somewhat disappointed with the awkward depiction of the Ents--the animated trees. They were clumsy and lethargic, and seemed to express senility more often than wisdom. I am not sure what words Tolkien used to describe these creatures, but I hope to find out soon as I embark on my first reading of the trilogy. This film has inspired me to return to Tolkien's world; I read the Hobbit when I was young, but never made it on to the Lord of the Rings.

I eagerly await the third film in the series, and should probably withhold judgement until the trilogy is complete; but I cannot help imagining that upon viewing the completed work as a whole, the Lord of the Rings will be considered one of the greatest films ever produced--quite surpassing Star Wars, the Wizard of Oz, or anything else in my memory."

Yes, it's true. Return of the King may have won more of the Oscars as the culmination of Peter Jackson's magnificent cinematic achievement, but history will in fact adjudge ""The Two Towers"" as the greatest of the three Rings. If Fellowship was a road movie and ROTK was a friendship film, then Two Towers is an unadulterated war movie of heroic proportions. Peter Jackson said he based it on ""Zulu""- and we can see why. It has a dramatic intensity and flow which none of the other films quite share. Good against evil are so sharply contrasted that you could cut your fingers on them. TTT also has the best score Howard Shore has produced. And it has the best dialogue.

The screenplay explains (with barely disguised contemporary resonance) what we are protecting in Western civilisation when we defend ourselves against those who would wish to destroy it. When Sam tells Frodo that there are ""some things worth fighting for"", when Merry tells Pippin that there ""won't be a Shire"" unless they do something about it, when King Theoden laments that ""the sun has gone down in the West"" this film could be entitled not the ""Two Towers"" but ""the Twin Towers"". It is Miltonic in its scope. It is cinema as art.

Yes, one may quibble about certain Entish details, and I know that the Elves weren't supposed to be at Helm's Deem, and that Faramir is a little undeveloped, but does this matter? Not at all. The Extended version is better than the original, but does not need to make such a quantum leap as Fellowship managed with its EE. However it will be a film that is seen as a landmark in cinema. A trilogy which may never be bettered. And a reminder of what we are all here for"

The future of civilization rests in the fate of the One Ring, which has been lost for centuries. Powerful forces are unrelenting in their search for it. But fate has placed it in the hands of a young Hobbit named Frodo Baggins, who inherits the Ring and steps into legend. A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the Ringbearer as his assigned duty is to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged. But he can't accomplish this task alone. A Fellowship bands together to lend Frodo all that he needs to carry out his mission: the wisdom of Gandalf; the loyalty of his friends Sam, Merry, and Pippin; the courage of Aragorn and Boromir; the precision of Legolas; and the strength of Gimli. They are aided in their quest by Arwen, Galadriel and Elrond, whose knowledge of the Ring brings to light the true danger and importance of their journey."

Hardcore Tolkien lovers might be upset by plot changes and interpretations made by Jackson and the other writers, however, it is unrealistic to expect a completely true adaptation of the novels, being that film is an entirely different medium. Despite the alterations, Jackson consistently stays true to the major themes and ideas from the original text, while adding some of the finest filmmaking ever put to screen. `The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' is one of the most finely tuned and cinematically perfect films ever made. Not only the best of the trilogy, but a crowning achievement in epic filmmaking."

/profiles/dQRueXHmquLVFzGuDaikqiXoSKY,NEUTRAL,kehabisan kata2 buat comment... bagus banget.. terutama adegan perang di helm's deep keren....
/profiles/dQefelum4sL2uzqhDaikJFXaTKR,NEUTRAL,"The epic journey continues in this grand second installment. Peter Jackson splits the narrative between Frodo and Sam making their way to Mordor, while Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are trying desperately to catch up with Uruk's currently holding Pip and Merry - little do they know that their quest will place them on the front line of the first great conflict in Lord of the Rings.
Naturally this conflict is the battle of Helm's Deep, which is by far a visual jewel of scale, emotion and hope. The sheer magnitude of what Jackson shows us is simply awe-inspiring - from the vast numbers of Saruman's Uruk army to the grand design of the fortress of Helm's Deep. Once the battle begins, the viewer is guaranteed an emotional rollercoaster - from the first arrow fired to the glorious end, the battle of Helm's Deep is a sheer monument of fantasy warfare.
On the other side of the spectrum, Jackson shows us Sam and Frodo making their way into the cursed lands of Mordor - naturally its not long before they realise they have no idea how to get there. Thus we are introduced to Gollum - a visual creation that will set the bar for CGI characters created on pre-recorded human movement. Throw in the talented Andy Sirkis as the model and you get a character who is not only famous from the book, but also becomes a staple of the entire trilogy. The character Gollum is only mentioned in the Fellowship of the Rings as being the original keeper of the ring before Bilbo finds it - this has led him on a desperate quest to find the ring again as his warped and damaged psyche cannot imagine life without it. This pitiful creature now becomes a guide for the lost hobbits, as he claims he knows the way to Mordor. Naturally Sam would rather kill Gollum than let him guide them anywhere, but Frodo starts to show the same pity his uncle showed all those years ago - plus they desperately need a guide who's crazy enough to take them to Mordor so their choice is alradey made.
 In this second installment we start to see the effects of the ring more evidently on Frodo - knowing that no one else can be trusted with the ring and seeing the results of long-term exposure on Gollum's crazy-eyed pasty face, we start to see the pressure of the whole quest slowly crushing him. 
All this comes together to show us that for Frodo and Sam, the challenge is more of a psychological one than a physical one. Throw in the emotional power keg that is the battle of Helm's Deep and what you get is the sheer definition of an Epic ballad.
Once again, full marks Mr Jackson."

I suppose it's because I just don't enjoy fantasy movies anymore.  At LEAST you can say I gave this a shot.  And don't get me wrong - it's a fantastic movie.  It's just not something I emotionally connect with much at all."

/profiles/9XluBeHM4F1PtwNuqxhGrfbPS8Z,NEUTRAL,"This, to me, was the best movie of the three. The tension and hopelessness at the Battle of Helm's Deep sealed the deal for me."
/profiles/m8XuD9sbMiaXT8JfdKIQquBASV4,NEUTRAL,I still have no idea what two towers this movie is referring to.
/profiles/x9XIVGFOBHNmsrXfyJSwauWKHjk,NEUTRAL,A really good effort to amke a film out of a difficult midle part.

/profiles/AlJu64sGeikNhpXs60IYVTKrTay,NEUTRAL,Another strong film by Peter Jackson.  The sequel to The Lord of the Rings is definitely a strong film.  The heart warming yet terrifying story of Frodo continues to be strong.

/profiles/9XwIBPFMRS1gHwvhqVTGrfbAh8r,NEUTRAL,this one's supposed to be the best book i guess w/the 3rd one bein the most boring but movie wise it's considered the worst i think

/profiles/2dvIWouZYinxf9XIemTgku14TxK,NEUTRAL,A fine tale about a coupla guys on another crazy adventure!!!
/profiles/KKvuk0sKjf6Oug1u8Lu9whkDH4g,NEUTRAL,"Once again, all of the performances are sharp and right on cue but this film belongs to Andy Serkis.  The fact that the man was given serious Oscar consideration for breathing life into a computer program should tell all of Hollywood that it has a lot to learn about acting.  It is amazing to me that after Jackson perfected CGI with Gollum that there are still films where the CGI is awful.  This book isn't even close to the novel but it is much more entertaining.  The Battle at Helm's Deep is amazing!"
/profiles/RkVuJzHlvhYyFn9f40IQYFBYfA4,NEUTRAL,The Lord Of The Rings is perfect for people who like fantasy & are devotees to the book.
/profiles/orRIDduJpT94iNLierhaXuZGs6l,NEUTRAL,not as good as the 1st one gollum was awesome got exceedingly boring in some parts

/profiles/pZkfMXTkPipyfyQilyHpZI0asR8,NEUTRAL,oh my .... Beautifully filmed as were all 3... need i say you must see all 3 ? i think not. One of the most luscious epics (all 3) in a long long while . Wonderful script .. talented actors .. great direction ... extraordinary costuming .... i have not one single complaint .. if you have not seen this franchise i envy you .. to see it for the first time in its entirety without the wait between films .. ohhhh myyyyy... SEE IT NOW ...
/profiles/pZjuMDsk0SpaTyKflyHpDi0asRV,NEUTRAL,meh i honestly like LOTR series i just don;t frankly care for it as much as everyone else. all the movies deserve good ratings  refuse to give them cuz other peopl eexagerate thema dn thus make me hate them.
/profiles/pZKsMKfkZhpyfyKflAFp2f0K,NEUTRAL,As I've said before.. I do love these movies. I'd be more than happy if they'd create 'the Hobbit'.
/profiles/ej0uyasGvixJiqafGvigyhwXuXK,NEUTRAL,hardly remember. they all run together.
/profiles/9XluBgsMBi1AuwZTqnIGOHbOi8d,NEUTRAL,I like all these movies
/profiles/AlqI60FGwFkWipwH6ZsYOuKmSar,NEUTRAL,"Again, the movie was unnecessarily too long, scenes they spent on landscape could have been spent on following the book more- and character traits should have been more to the book, and stop adding romance where it shouldn't be! good movie otherwise- but the BOOKS are ALWAYS better!!!!!"
/profiles/qAkIOPupyilosRJhzxS9DikQuzJ,NEUTRAL,improves on the first. introduces us to the incredibly fascinating character of gollum.
/profiles/wL6I6gFmwixbsLeHMDuvwSoJuVJ,NEUTRAL,"Not as cohesive of a story as the other two, but very entertaining."
/profiles/ap6Ir2FyLsKqSrysJ4SzmsPpi2B,NEUTRAL,Loved this trilogy - never thought I would but my son made me take him to the first one.
/profiles/nxyIDeupvfG2FwOTaBfojHdeiAM,NEUTRAL,Go Ents (trees)! Gotta love that scene. Interesting sequel. It is better than the first? I'm not sure. I did enjoy it. Pretty long.
/profiles/GPDu0auKvieQf8yFwDiMliKRIe9,NEUTRAL,"HyvÃ¤ leffa, mutta vÃ¤lillÃ¤ tylsÃ¤"
/profiles/yr2IYZFjgfKlHzduPafqauAgujy,NEUTRAL,"perhaps the strongest of the three movies - some creative liberties taken here and there, but i thought it was excellent, especially as an adaptation of a Very difficult book to adapt"
/profiles/9XwIBNuMJT1rSwZTqVTGOHbOi8g,NEUTRAL,My favorite part was the preperation leading up to the Battle of Helm's Deep (and the battle as well). It was very emotional.
/profiles/42KHVDskbfLysXpsx1IXgSLGsP2,NEUTRAL,The best lord of the rings movie...well my favorite at least..I think my brother would have something to say about that...but oh well.
/profiles/qAkIOBFpyilASR0SzyH9WFkzTzp,NEUTRAL,"Much better than the first, to be honest. It shed the innocence more and made it a more ""realistic"" fantasy story. One that people can actually compare themselves with in certain humanistic aspects."
