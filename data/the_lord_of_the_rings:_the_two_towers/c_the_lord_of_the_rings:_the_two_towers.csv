Cofundador y editor en FotografíaCalato.com y NoEsEnSerie.com, y crítico de Cinencuentro.com, MeGustaElCine.com, y Ventana Indiscreta. No tengo miedo de decir que “Las Dos Torres” es la entrega más floja de la trilogía de “El Señor de los Anillos”. Lo bueno, en todo caso, es que el estándar establecido por las otras dos películas es tan alto, que esto quiere decir que la segunda cinta igual es extraordinaria. Simplemente no es tan extraordinaria como “La Comunidad del Anillo” o “El Retorno del Rey”. Se trata del capítulo intermedio, y por ende tiene que actualizarnos sobre lo que sucede con los personajes que conocimos en la primera película, avanzar con el conflicto entre héroes y villanos, y establecer personajes nuevos, conflictos nuevos, y situaciones que serán resueltas en la entrega final. No es una tarea fácil, y aunque cuenta con más defectos que sus contrapartes, igual hace un excelente trabajo manejando todos estos aspectos. “Las Dos Torres” comienza con una suerte de flashback, en donde vemos lo que de verdad sucedió con Gandalf El Gris (Ian McKellen) luego de que se cayó al abismo junto al demoníaco Balrog en el interior de las Minas de Moria. Luego de ese breve prólogo, regresamos a donde nuestros hobbits principales, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) y Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin), quienes se encuentran perdidos, tratando de llegar a Mordor, hogar del malévolo Sauron. Es en esos peligrosos caminos que se terminan aliando con Gollum (Andy Serkis), una criatura frágil, desagradable y psicológicamente atormentada, que años atrás fue corrompida por el Anillo Único, y que ahora guía a nuestros héroes a la Reja Negra de Mordor. Mientras tanto, el humano Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), el elfo Legolas (Orlando Bloom) y el enano Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) están tras el rastro de un grupo de uruk-hai, quienes en la película pasada secuestraron a los hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) y Pippin (Billy Boyd). Es así que el trío termina adentrándose en la tierra de Rohan, señores de los caballos, donde se encuentran con un rey llamado Théoden (Bernard Hill), corrompido y manipulado por Saruman (Christopher Lee), y su sobrina llamada Eowyn (Miranda Otto), que está siendo acosada por un consejero manipulador llamado Grima (Brad Dourif). Nuestros héroes, por supuesto, tendrán que ayudar a toda esta gente, mientras el maléfico Saruman envía su enorme ejército de uruk-hai para invadir el país de Rohan. Finalmente, regresamos donde Merry y Pippin, quienes son rescatados por Treebeard (voz de John Rhys-Davies). Este último es un ent, un árbol que habla, camina y tiene pensamientos, y que se convertirá, junto a sus compañeros, en una figura importante a la hora de derrotar a Saruman y acabar con sus fábricas de uruk-hai en Isengard. Es así que tenemos estas tres líneas narrativas en paralelo, en las que seguimos a nuestros héroes, antes juntos, tratando de combatir las fuerzas de Saruman y Sauron, y encontrándose con nuevos amigos y enemigos. Frodo, Sam y Gollum, por ejemplo, terminan siendo capturados por el capitán Faramir de Gondor (David Wenham), hermano menor del finado Boromir quien, al igual que este último, considera que el Anillo Único es un arma poderosa que debe ser usada por los humanos.  Es así que nos vamos dando cuenta que “Las Dos Torres” es una experiencia distinta a la de la primera película. Nuestros héroes se han separado luego de la muerte de algunos de sus compañeros, y cuentan ahora con objetivos distintos, todos relacionados, por supuesto, a la batalla contra las fuerzas del mal. De las tres líneas narrativas principales, la más interesante, para vuestro servidor, es la de Aragorn, Legolas y Gimli. No solo nos permite ver lugares nuevos de la Tierra Media y conocer a personajes interesantes, sino que también tangibiliza algunos de los conceptos que han sido mencionados desde “La Comunidad del Anillo”. Nos permite ver exactamente por qué es que nuestros héroes están peleando; a quienes están defendiendo, qué tipo de personas pueblan las diferentes zonas de la Tierra Media, y qué tan difícil resulta enfrentarse a las fuerzas de Saruman. Todo esto llega a su clímax, por supuesto, en la Batalla de Helm’s Deep. Incluso más que la primera película, “Las Dos Torres” realiza varios cambios en relación a su fuente de inspiración, la mayoría estructurales, y el más significativo siendo poner a la Batalla de Helm’s Deep como el enfrentamiento climático de la historia. Esto resulta en una de las secuencias de guerra más impresionante de la historia del cine, en la que vemos tanto a nuestros héroes, como las fuerzas de Rohan y un grupo de soldados élficos (otro cambio importante en relación a la novela; estos personajes simplemente no aparecen en en libro), pelear contra el ejército de uruk-hai de Isengard.  Es un verdadero tour de force; una secuencia extensa pero consistentemente emocionante, en donde Jackson demuestra ser un maestro a la hora de escenificar y coreografiar violencia. Ya casi se ha deshecho de los planos cercanos y cámaras nerviosas de la primera película; todo es mostrado con claridad, justificando la fuerte presencia de luz en una escena nocturna, con imágenes impactantes y que, sin ser completamente realistas, están al servicio de la narrativa. Desde el comienzo, tenso y prologado, en donde los uruks llegan y se posicionan frente al castillo, hasta el asedio por parte del enemigo, Legolas y Gimli contando los monstruos a los que van matando, y el último esfuerzo por parte de Aragorn y Théoden por acabar la batalla de manera gloriosa y valiente… todo está dirigido com aplomo y seguridad, por un Jackson consciente de lo que debe hacer y cómo. Secuencias de esta potencia y poder visual no se ven con mucha frecuencia en el cine comercial contemporáneo. Por supuesto, el clímax violento de la historia no es lo único que tiene “Las Dos Torres” para ofrecer. La percepción que uno tiene de la Tierra Media, por ejemplo, es expandida con la introducción de Rohan —y los problemas tanto políticos como personales y hasta románticos que nuestros protagonistas encuentran en los salones de Théoden. Y siguiendo con los cambios respecto al libro, Jackson inserta un emocionante enfrentamiento entre humanos y jinetes de wargs, una escena que simplemente no existe en la obra de Tolkien. En la película, no obstante, sirve para inyectarle tensión adicional a la narrativa, darle una preocupación adicional a nuestros héroes, poner en peligro a Aragorn, y en general, mejorar el ritmo de la historia. Ninguna de estas películas es para los puristas —varios fanáticos seguramente les dirán lo mismo—, pero me animaría a decir que “Las Dos Torres” es la película que más cambios (para bien) ha sufrido respecto a su fuente de inspiración original. Respecto a las dos líneas narrativa restantes, desgraciadamente lo que resulta más tedioso es ver a Merry y Pippin junto con Treebeard. Este último es un personaje divertido, y de hecho, no me puedo quejar de la secuencia en la que finalmente logra involucrarse, junto con sus compañeros, en un asedio a Isengard. Pero todo lo que viene antes es lento y aburrido. Entiendo que esto es adrede —los ents son seres pacientes y calmados, que experimentan el tiempo de forma distinta a los humanos—, pero debo admitir que, al menos cuando veo esta película solo en casa, suelo saltearme las escenas en las que los hobbits esperan a que los árboles parlantes tomen algún tipo de decisión respecto a la guerra. Nuevamente; es una decisión creativa coherente con el libro y hecha a propósito, pero esto no quiere decir que funcione para vuestro servidor. Lo cual, por supuesto, nos deja con la historia de Sam y Frodo. Es aquí donde sí encontramos algo interesante, especialmente en los que se refiere a Gollum. Traído a la vida con expertise por el gran Andy Serkis, se trata de un personaje complejo, conflictivo, que cuenta con una personalidad doble. Primero está el inocente Sméagol, que solo quiere ayudar a sus amigos hobbits y llevarlos a donde quieren ir. Y luego está Gollum, la criatura corrompida por el Anillo Único, que se quiere deshacer de sus nuevos maestros para quedarse con la joya de Sauron. Esto resulta en escenas hipnotizantes que ponen en evidencia los considerables talentos de Serkis, uno de los pioneros de la actuación virtual, y quién más adelante interpretaría a King Kong para el mismísimo Jackson, y al líder de los simios, César, en la trilogía de “El planeta de los simios”. Su Gollum, no obstante, es quien lo comenzó todo, y es todo un deleite verlo en pantalla. Aparte de él también resulta fascinante ver la evolución de la relación entre Frodo y Sam. Habiendo comenzado como mejores amigos, somos testigos de como el Anillo va corrompiendo a Frodo, haciendo que se comporte casi como un drogadicto —siendo su droga, por supuesto, el Anillo mismo—, y alejándose de Samwise. Es una relación que se va haciendo cada vez más unilateral, con Sam tratando de jalar a Frodo a la luz, y Frodo siendo tentado por el Anillo para adentrarse en la oscuridad. Gollum, además, no ayuda —Frodo siente pena por él, e irónicamente, se va comportando cada vez más como él, incluso llamando al Anillo como su “tesoro”. Ver a estos personajes interactuando con el ya mencionado Faramir, nos dice mucho sobre la fortaleza de Frodo, la debilidad de los hombres, y el poder del Anillo —y nos permite, eventualmente, considerar a Faramir como alguien mejor que su hermano mayor. Más sobre él veremos, pues, en “El Retorno del Rey”. Ahora bien, es esta película la que va demostrando la afinidad que Jackson tiene por la tecnología digital. Mientras que “La Comunidad del Anillo” se siente tangible, combinando muy bien escenarios reales con maquetas y creaciones digitales, es aquí donde se comienza a abusar un poquito de lo generado por computadora. Se ve en la inclusión de los Espectros Voladores del Anillo, Gollum, Treebeard y algunos planos de la Batalla Final. Nada en “Las Dos Torres” luce horrible, pero sí se nota una mayor dependencia de la pantalla verde y el chroma key, con algunos planos luciendo un poco más falsos que otros. No es nada grave, y “Las Dos Torres” sigue siendo todo un logro técnico y creativo, pero hay algo de la practicidad y naturalidad de la primera cinta que se ha perdido acá. Nuevamente: al menos para vuestro servidor, “Las Dos Torres” es la más flojita de las tres películas de “El Señor de los Anillos”. Pero como se dijo líneas arriba, la calidad de las otras dos entregas es tan alta, que eso no convierte a esta segunda parte en algo difícil de recomendar. Sí, cuenta con algunos planos exageradamente sintéticos; y sí, no me fascinan las escenas con Treebeard y los dos hobbits. Pero en general, y con varios cambios estructurales respecto a la novela, “Las Dos Torres” de Peter Jackson logra cementar lo que se vio en la cinta anterior, y desarrollar mucho de lo que será presentado con mayor detalle en la película climática. La Batalla de Helm’s Deep es espectacular, Gollum es una de las creaciones digitales más importantes de la historia del cine, y en general, la experiencia de ver “Las Dos Torres” no podría ser más entretenida. Es un capítulo intermedio, y por ende no funciona de forma tan individual como los otros dos, pero igual se trata de un blockbuster expertamente realizado, y que ha envejecido muy poco. Sigo siendo fan."
"Jul 28, 2023",POSITIVE," You’d think that tacking on an additional 43 minutes to the three-hour movie would be overkill. But the extended version actually feels shorter than the theatrical release — possibly because it tells a more thorough story. “Two Towers” continues where “The Fellowship of the Ring” left off. With the Fellowship splintered into two groups, Frodo and Sam head for Mordor to destroy the Ring. They are aided by Gollum, a mysterious creature who once was a hobbit but now may not be trusted. Meanwhile, the trifecta of man, elf and dwarf (Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli) head to Rohan to defend the last of a dying breed — human beings. Where the extended version enhances the original theatrical release is in its filling in of the details that director Peter Jackson had to cut out to ensure that moviegoers wouldn’t leave theaters before the film was over. Anyone who saw “Two Towers” in theaters last winter will recognize that the film’s beginning is different. Before Gollum confronts Frodo and Sam, the pair is shown joking and pratfalling before they realize exactly how lost they are. Their always ravenous fellow hobbits Merry and Pippin also get extended play, at one point floating through a sea of delectable treats. We also learn that the studly warrior and would-be king, Aragorn, actually is an old man of 87. The best back story, though, is that of Boromir and his brother Faramir. Boromir was killed in “Fellowship.” In the theatrical version of “Two Towers,” we saw Faramir as a rather heartless soldier who treated Frodo and Sam unkindly. In the DVD version, Jackson shows how the brothers grew up — with their father favoring Boromir and treating Faramir as the screwup he never was. You don’t excuse his behavior, but you begin to understand why he is who he is. This four-disc set also includes extras such as production documentaries, photo galleries and a really cool look at the making of Gollum/Smeagol. But the real treat is those extra 43 minutes that tie the film together without making it feel any longer. Currently you have JavaScript disabled.

"Aug 23, 2022",POSITIVE," Peter Jackson’s “The Fellowship of the Ring” was an extraordinary introduction to his “Lord of the Rings” trilogy. It not only introduced us to its compelling assortment of characters, but it also firmly planted us within J.R.R. Tolkien’s vast enchanting world. But it’s the second installment, “The Two Towers” where the series truly hits its stride. “The Two Towers” takes the story of its predecessor and expands it in every way. Fascinating new characters, more lands throughout Middle-Earth, and even higher stakes than before. But one of Jackson’s many great accomplishments is how seamlessly he blends these new pieces into the existing fabric. And despite the immensity of his scope, the movie never loses its intimacy. Picking up where “Fellowship” left off, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam’s (Sean Astin) journey to destroy the One Ring has grown more arduous and the weight of the ring more burdensome. As the two struggle to find a path to Mordor, the sallow, emaciated Gollum (Andy Serkis) secretly follows them. He was the ring’s former owner, consumed by its power and desperate to reclaim it. When Gollum is discovered Frodo shows pity and uses him as a guide against the pleas of a concerned Sam. A second story thread follows Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) as they follow the trail of their abducted Hobbit companions Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd). They are led through the war-torn lands of Rohan whose King Theodin (Bernard Hill) lies under a spell of the wicked wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee). And yet a third story thread follows the aforementioned Merry and Pippin who manage to escape their Uruk-hai captors after the Orc soldiers are attacked by Éomer (Karl Urban) and his exiled Riders of Rohan. The two Hobbits hide deep within Fanghorn Forest where they encounter a mysterious tree beings called Ents. The challenges for this incredible three-headed story are obvious. Huge in scale and with a ton of ground to cover, yet vitally important that it all comes together. Jackson melds together his many moving parts with remarkable precision. And of the several new characters introduced not a one feels wasted or undeserved. Each fit and have a place in Tolkien’s tumultuous world yet have their own personal storylines that take form without ever feeling pointless or intrusive. It’s a remarkable mixture of character and narrative. Then there is the genius of Jackson’s technique. From his sweeping camera combing the exquisite New Zealand landscapes to the subtlest of closeups capturing every worry, concern, and pain of the characters. Equally exhilarating are the action scenes both small and epic in size. It’s hard not to be blown away by his framing of the action as well as Weta Workshop’s extraordinary special effects. Jackson really opens it up with the first of the series’ huge battlefield sequences. The Battle for Helm’s Deep remains my favorite segment in the entire trilogy. Much more could be talked about including Jackson’s knack for not only building tension but maintaining it throughout a sequence. Also “The Two Towers” highlights Jackson’s keen ability to convey to the audience an incredible sense of the mystical and magical. The world he and his teams place us in are rich with imagination and the fantastical. But the greatest thing about the series is that it’s far more than eye candy and sparkly window dressing. It’s the characters and their stories that form the heart of trilogy. That’s especially true for “The Two Towers”. Someday I will have to watch these movies again.  I remember not liking Two Towers as much because it deviated from the book and I am a bit of a purist when it comes to that haha.  But I really do need to watch them again and maybe appreciate this one for its on-screen value, because books and screens are two very different mediums. Very true. I get being a purist, but you’re exactly right. They are very different mediums. For me, deviating from source material is okay as long as it makes sense and serves well the story the filmmaker is telling. What stinks is when filmmakers deviate from the source material and the results miss the mark. It’s tricky though. The whole trilogy has been on Starz! lately as I re-watched them as there’s so many things about the the trilogy that is awesome.  I agree that The Two Towers doesn’t get enough love as I enjoyed the strands of narrative into the three journeys of the Fellowship and how it impacts everyone.  The extended version of that film I feel is an improvement as it gave the audience more information about who Faramir as well as Boromir who we first saw in the film as kind of a dick but once we see him in the 2nd part of the extended film.  We realize that he was acting more like his father and was more concerned in giving his brother some praise. I adore the extended editions. They fill in so much information. I do love Boromir. I was indeed seduced by the power of the ring. But he was also a great redemption story. He sacrificed himself to try and buy time for the others. And his heartfelt confession to Aragorn still gets me. Same here.  I also loved what they did for Faramir in the extended version of the film where he took Frodo, Sam, and Gollum to a secret path as it showed his own path for not just redemption but also to keep the ring away from Gondor. Great review, but seeing “The Lord of the Rings” in the same line with the word “Retro” felt weird for me and a little bit painful, because for me it seemed like yesterday that the Lord was in cinemas, and I do miss very much the 2000-2002 period in films. My favourite has got to be the first movie, but I do get all the appreciation for this one too. I know. I’m thinking I should take Retro off. Is it really retro? I don’t know. It would certainly make me feel better if it wasn’t! LOL! While I’ll always have a soft spot for Fellowship, particularly the Balrog sequence, Two Towers will always be the best overall film in the trilogy for story, character and pacing, and of course the Helms Deep attack. When that wall blew apart, so did my mind. Just an astonishing film accomplishment.  (Disclosure: over the last few weeks I’ve been digging into both the Rings and Hobbit appendicies DVDs, reminiscing over my love of all things Middle Earth.) Oh man, those extended editions are so good. Love them. As for Two Towers so many scenes stand out. When the wall blew…yes. The expressions and sense of dread. It’s fabulous. You really feel a sense of doom. But when Gandolf shows up with a light to the east…I get chills."
"May 20, 2022",POSITIVE,The Battle of Helm&apos;s Deep&#44; in it of itself&#44; is a grand cinematic achievement&#46; The Two Towers is possibly the best middle entry of any film trilogy ever&#46; &#91;Full review in Spanish&#93;
"Mar 12, 2022",POSITIVE," Peter Jackson’s cinematic recreation of Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) is thrilling, enthralling, and dizzyingly exciting. Jackson finds the soul of the film in Viggo Mortensen’s wandering warrior-prince Aragorn, reveals the torment in Elijah Wood’s chosen-one pilgrim Frodo and the soul-crushing weight of the ring that Tolkien could only talk around. And he turns the wary relationship between Frodo and the gnarled, psychotically obsessed Gollum into the defining drama of Frodo’s hopes and fears along the quest. The famously computer generated Gollum is a wonder of a character, a feral stray dog with a schizophrenic nature at war with himself when he gets his first taste of kindness from Frodo, as tragically human as any character in the party. The motion-capture performance by Andy Serkis set the bar for the marriage of acting and special effects. Jackson dares to throw the viewer into the fray without little more than a brief, nightmarish flashback, and turns the Battle of Helm’s Deep, a brief ten page episode in the novel, into the thrilling turning point in the war: the first glimpse of the coming apocalypse and the triumph of solidarity in the face of the march of evil. Jackson’s camera once again swoops over landscapes like an eagle, charges through the hordes that blanket the earth, and slows only in moments of intimacy. More than simply translate the fantasy masterpiece to the screen with respect, Jackson brings blood and thunder and human scale to a tale so long relegated to the archetypes of myth. The returning cast includes Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Sean Astin as Frodo’s loyal friend Samwise, Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd as hobbits Merry and Pippin, Orlando Bloom as elf warrior Legolas, John Rhys-Davies as dwarf warrior Gimli, and Christopher Lee as Saruman. Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving, Miranda Otto, Bernard Hill, David Wenham, Karl Urban, and Brad Dourif costar. Months after the film was released to DVD and Blu-ray, Jackson released an extended version exclusively to home video. Running almost four hours long, Jackson’s extended version weaves not just deleted scenes back into his vision, but additional background and character insight shaved out of existing scenes. Most of it is, appropriately, folded into the beginning (which reintroduces Frodo with an entirely different scene) and ending (giving the audience more time to ease down from the power of the Battle of Helm’s Deep). Though not “essential” information, it adds in the kind of weight that gives the epic even greater heft and home video is the perfect arena for such an expansion. There is about 40 minutes of new footage all told; 11 minutes of longer version belong to credits dedicated to the members of the Lord of the Rings Fan Club. Don’t miss a single recommendation.

Supplements on the two disc special edition of the original theatrical version include the 14-minute made-for-cable documentary On the Set: The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (originally made for Starz) and the 43-minute WB special Return to Middle-Earth, Sean Astin’s five-minute side project The Long and Short of It (a sweet little short made with volunteers from the cast and crew) and a “making of” Astin’s film, and eight brief behind-the-scenes featurettes originally made for www.lordoftherings.net. Disc 3 and 4—”The Appendices”—feature an epic documentary to match the production, following the film from adapting and scripting through constructing the sets and props, shooting the production, and creating the special effects, to editing, scoring, and mixing the film, all organized in well-shaped chapters that can be viewed individually or seen straight through as a single six-hour overview. The chapter on Gollum (a fascinating invitation into the process of creating a fully fleshed out CGI character and a tribute to the skills of Andy Serkis, whose “performance” helped sculpt and enrich that character) can stand alone as a feature length piece. To supplement the documentary are an atlas of Middle-earth tracing the journey, an interactive map of New Zealand showing the shooting locations, and galleries featuring hundreds of behind-the-scenes photographs, personal cast photos, and production art (which can also be viewed as slideshows with commentaries by the artists). The Gift Set features a Gollum polystone statue created by Sideshow Weta, a bonus DVD with a documentary about the Weta Workshop and how the Gollum statue was created, and a printed companion piece showing how Gollum evolved from pencil sketch to digital character.

"Oct 27, 2020",POSITIVE," Amazon Prime Video has developed a sizeable bank of movies over the years, and remains arguably the best streaming platform to offer a cross section of Indian cinema. But endless scrolling to find the gems can be tiresome. That's why we're bringing you our list of 60 of the best movies currently streaming on Amazon Prime Video India (as of October 2020). Let the bingeing begin. The Adam Driver-led riveting investigative thriller chronicles the Senate's investigation into the CIA's use of torture following the 9/11 attacks. The Report is both engrossing and infuriating, and serves as the perfect counter piece to Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty. Lijo Jose Pellissery's kinetic spectacle, based on S Hareesh's short story Maoist, explores masculinity like few films before it. At a basic level, the film is about retrieving a lost buffalo. But, that one-line summary doesn't do justice to the surreal energy and spectacular chaos of the film. People have been picking it apart for its 'meaning' ever since it released. We invite you to do the same. A gangster-esque saga set in the world of politics, Prithviraj Sukumaran's impressive directorial debut is the larger-than-life masala film done right. The Mohanlal-starrer is bursting with swag, has a genuinely gripping plot and is full of delicious twists and turns resulting in a strong political drama and delicious revenge saga in equal measure. Nag Ashwin's Mahanati is an ode to one of Telugu cinema's greatest actors—Savitri. Nag Ashwin's take on the Saviritri story successfully explores a complex woman and her turbulent journey, brought to life by an unforgettable performance from Keerthy Suresh. Todd Haynes' spellbinding book adaption is as visually dazzling as it is sensitive. Haynes takes you on a deeply affecting journey by following the adventures of two deaf children across different time periods while exploring their curious connection. The action epic that put Kannada cinema on the map like few before it, became the first Kannada film to cross the Rs. 100-crore mark at the box office. The ambitious gangster saga led by 'Rocking Star Yash' is a rousing underdog story which gives Indian cinema yet another larger-than-life franchise to look forward to. Kathryn Bigelow's expansive drama follows the decade-long international manhunt for Osama bin Laden, from the events of 9/11 to his eventual death at the hands of US Marines. In Konkona Sen Sharma's sparkling directorial debut, a shy and sensitive Indian student (Vikrant Massey) pays a heavy price for his gentleness, while on a road trip with his conceited relatives and family friends. Led by a hauntingly beautiful performance from Massey, A Death In The Gunj remains one of the strongest ensemble dramas of recent years. Tamil cinema has had its share of father-daughter based films but few are as affecting, complex and disturbing as this Mammootty starrer. The film dives into the psyche of a helpless father who's taken custody of his teenage daughter suffering from cerebral palsy. Peranbu is a piercing coming of age drama which also raises several pertinent questions about parenting, disability and sexuality. Kumail Nanjiani and Emily Gordon's real-life love story serves as inspiration for the film that put romantic comedies back on the map. Bursting with heart and great one liners, The Big Sick is a witty and charming exploration of love and family while exploring clashing cultures with a much needed dose of empathy. Led by a career-topping performance from Ram Charan, set in the '80s, Rangasthalam tells the story of an innocent villager with a hearing impairment who gets mixed up in a political feud involving his elder brother. Director Sukumar impressively uses the big masala film to explore caste, class and oppression. Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Laura Dern, Timothée Chalamet, and Meryl Streep star in a movie from writer-director Greta Gerwig's that does justice to their insane collective talent and the book on which the movie is based. That's it. That's all you need to know. When a boy from an impoverished and oppressed farming family kills a big shot, his father (Dhanush in fantastic form) fears retribution. He flees with the boy, the big shot's men in pursuit. Coming right after Vetri Maaran-Dhanush's gorgeous Vada Chennai, Asuran evokes mixed feelings. The screenplay is brilliantly cyclical and there's no denying the power of the mood and the material in a film you won't be able to shake off for days on end. A woman wakes up without clothes in a desolate building. You'd think you were in for a survival drama like Trapped. But Rathna Kumar 's Aadai plays with your head by making Kamini (a sensational Amala Paul) a fascinating and morally questionable figure, leading to one hell of a morality tale. When it comes to huge spectacle action, there is no greater living example than the chaotic achievement that is George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road. Fury Road is just non-stop, carefully crafted carnage which somehow manages to be coherent, all while having used minimal CGI. Fury Road is a masterpiece of mayhem which cemented Charlize Theron as one of the greatest modern action stars and there's no experience quite like it. In an industry inundated with stories where things always work out, Akshay Roy's Meri Pyaari Bindu gave Hindi cinema a rare look at heartbreak. It made a long overdue case for why some relationships don't always work out and how sometimes that is the happy ending. Ayushmann Khurrana stars as the writer who can't get over the one that got away, Parineeti Chopra as Bindu. A bleak drama from Kenneth Lonergan, Manchester by the Sea is a deeply personal film which examines the ways tragedy can wear away at a person's soul, and whether it is possible to come back from the brink. Despite the heart-breaking premise,  the film is filled with unexpected moments of humour and warmth. Winner of the National Award for best Hindi film, Rajkummar Rao stars as a fish-out-of-water government clerk who tries to run a free and fair election in the Naxal-controlled conflict-ridden jungles of India in a nuanced film that explores the painful shortcomings of Indian democracy. Gareth Evans' gloriously violent Indonesian film features a police officer trapped in an apartment building filled with an army of bad guys he has to fight his way through. It has relentless end-to-end killing with some of the most brutal fight scenes you've ever seen. But despite its singular bone breaking vision, it still manages to have a satisfying plot and some fantastically well-crafted scenes of tension amidst the blood bath. On face value, Doug Liman's Edge Of Tomorrow deals with familiar tropes – of a war for the planet and time loops and alien invasions – but it's brilliantly executed with some fantastic combat sequences. Not to mention one of the most badass female action heroes in Emily Blunt's Full Metal Bitch. Edge Of Tomorrow has Tom Cruise as a man forced to relive the same day over and over again in a spectacular action flick that you just want to revisit over and over again. War is the definitive Bollywood action film of its time which proved to the world that Hindi cinema can do the slick sophisticated blockbuster, and do it well. It's Tiger Shroff's best film and the only film that's really known how to capture his ability and channel it into something actually cinematic. Even at its most ridiculous it's never not fun and it perfectly nailed the novelty of the 'two hero film'. War is an unapologetic star vehicle at its best, bursting with style, attitude and just pure swag. It's hard to pick just one amongst Peter Jackson's Middle Earth epic. In terms of battle sequences alone,  it's hard to find one that's quite as daunting and absorbing as the Battle for Helm's Deep in The Two Towers, followed closely by the Battle for Minas Tirith in The Return Of The King. In one of the greatest good vs evil stories ever told, Peter Jackson throws you onto the battlefield with your favourite characters. It's also straight up badass, because…Legolas. Just Legolas. The predictable but urgent Malayalam-language thriller has the sort of moral premise that allows it to transcend the trappings of ""lockdown storytelling"" and exist as an organic computer-screen movie – more on the lines of international hits like Searching and Unfriended. The revelations aren't shocking, but there's an arc to its characters – especially Fahadh Faasil's – that humanizes both the distance and intimacy of modern technology. Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Chupke Chupke is a laugh-out-loud comedy of errors about a man who is pretending to be a driver. Expect constant confusion and choreographed chaos of the best kind. The definitive coming-of-age drama, which marked the directorial debut of Farhan Akhtar, remains just as complex and intricate today as it did when it came out almost 20 years ago. Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna play loyal friends that overcome various obstacles of life in a film that captures college life and the transition into adulthood like no film before it, and few since have. One of Indian cinema's most iconic comedy, the film takes a deep, dark look into the scandals of bureaucracy and politics. Two Mumbai-based photographers get caught up a builder's surreptitious dealings with the government along with a murder which ends with the comical revamp of the Mahabharata that will forever be etched in cinema history. Few movies can claim to have the level of national presence and dedicated following of Jab We Met. With Geet's lovable chattiness, Pritam's groovy soundtrack and so much more, Imtiaz Ali created his own canon for Bollywood rom-coms filled with humour and emotion of an unforgettable kind. Amitabh Bachchan's, ""I can talk English, I can walk English, I can laugh English"" is forever etched in the hallmark of great Bollywood dialogues. This is a blockbuster comedy difficult to top. Bachchan maintains his comic timing, beating thugs with style, and with Bappi Lahiri's evergreen soundtrack, this action-comedy is one for the ages. The directorial debut of Nandita Das, set one month after the 2002 Gujarat Riots, explores the lives of the survivors and victims unabashedly – those that witnessed an entire city burn and crumble. This pithy and haunting film goes deep into the psychological and mental anguish the communal riots caused, and through that, makes a plea for peace and harmony. Family Guy creator Seth Macfarlane brings his signature pop-culture-referencing insult-comedy style to this story of a boy whose birthday wish brings his teddy bear to life. Except 30 years later, it's not as cute anymore as the two man-children just lounge around doing drugs and being idiots. Ted gives us one of the greatest comedic characters – a lovable, foul-mouthed cuddly toy full of memorable one-liners who armed us with an arsenal of handy insults. Set against the backdrop of the 2018 Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala, individuals from various walks of life come together to contain its spread in this gripping Malayalam-language thriller. Parvathy Thiruvothu, Tovino Thomas, and Revathi star in a film that's never been more relevant and, despite its haunting subject matter, is ultimately a story of hope. One man's heart-pounding crusade to tear down the crooked system that created him, The Bourne Trilogy is a shining example of a single story told over three parts, (the less said about the 2016 attempt to reboot the series, the better). The sophisticated espionage series that reinvented onscreen action gave us a new, more rooted kind of spy thriller, far removed from the Bond school of blockbuster, but no less exhilarating. Rajkumar Santoshi's immensely quotable cult classic about a pair of hapless slugs who hatch hare-brained schemes to get rich (played by Aamir Khan and Salman Khan), remains every bit the whirlwind comedy it was when it came out decades ago. For everything else, there's Crime Master Gogo. In what remains one of the greatest and most influential gangster epics of all time, City Of God chronicles the lives of young gangsters in Brazil's sultry slums, giving us a sprawling saga of drugs, poverty, crime and utter swag. A shining example of the new wave of Telugu cinema, the well-crafted comedy thriller starring Naveen Polishetty is as hilarious as it is engrossing, masterfully navigating the delicate balance act of humour and a tense, high stakes plot surrounding a series of murders. Years before he was asked to reboot another iconic space saga, JJ Abrams was tasked with reimagining Star Trek, leading to a well-conceived and sorely underrated reimagining of the iconic franchise. Star Trek, masterfully paid homage to the old while paving the way for the new, whilst also making it accessible to those of us who weren't previously married to the Star Trek franchise. With a strong ensemble cast recreating beloved characters, Abrams gave us an origin story of the USS Enterprise and its colourful crew, led by the Chris Pine's charismatic James T Kirk. Shankar's pure, unhinged sci-fi spectacle, for all its slipups, has two things we rarely see in Indian cinema – dazzling imagination and sheer vision. The scale, the visuals, the many forms of Rajinikanth going head to head with Akshay Kumar make the film a must watch. Rahi Anil Barve's debut film must be celebrated not only for its ambition, gumption and scale, but also its fascinating exploration of the horror fantasy genre. While looking for a secret treasure in a village in 20th-century Maharashtra, a man and his son face the consequences of building a temple for a legendary demon who's not supposed to be worshipped. A minor confrontation between a cop and an ex-army man snowballs into an escalation of egos and powerplay. Directed and written by Sachy and anchored by two terrific performances from Biju Menon and Prithviraj Sukumaran, Ayyappanum Koshiyum is a fascinating exploration of masculinity and privilege, neatly packaged in a riveting thriller. Deliciously despicable and delectably sinister, Bornila Chatterjee's The Hungry is a gloriously well-made revenge drama lead by an electric ensemble of seasoned performers like Naseeruddin Shah, Tisca Chopra and Sayani Gupta. Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie lead the ensemble cast of Quentin Tarantino's ""fairy tale tribute"" to the waning days of Hollywood's golden age, which follows an ageing actor (DiCaprio) and his long-time friend and stunt double (Pitt) as they navigate a changing industry. This nostalgic throwback to classic sci-fi thrillers follows a young switchboard operator and a radio DJ whose discovery of a mysterious audio frequency sets off a series of discoveries that lead them deep into the unknown. The Vast of Night is a film you won't forget, announcing its writers, director, and cast as new talents to watch out for. Set in the coastal of village of Chellanam near Ernakulam, Lijo Jose Pellissery's sixth film traces a series of unfortunate events that follows the death of Vavachan Mestri (Kainakary Thankaraj) a few moments after he tells his son Eeshi (Chemban Vinod Jose) about his dream funeral. Despite the sombre setting, the film takes the form of a dark comedy with several laugh-out-loud moments popping up every few minutes. Four brothers who share a love-hate relationship stand behind one of their own in matters of the heart in this Malayalam-language family drama that has fast become one of the most beloved Indian films of recent years. An idealistic young man from a poor, oppressed caste family strikes a friendship with a much wealthier female classmate at law school in this Tamil-language film, earning him the wrath of her relatives and the society at large. Directed by Mari Selvaraj and produced by Pa. Ranjith, Pariyerum Perumal is a scathing look at the caste system and the society that is blind to it. After Mulk and Article 15, Anubhav Sinha set his sights on domestic abuse in his most recent social drama Thappad. The film stars Taapsee Pannu as a devoted wife whose entire world is shaken after her seemingly loving husband (Pavail Gulati) slaps her in a fit of rage. What follows is her messy, turbulent quest for justice and divorce, all while her family, friends and lawyers try and make her 'see reason' and not overreact at what was 'just a slap'. Gully Boy followed a predictable underdog trajectory but Zoya Akhtar and co-writer Reema Kagti build on these layers of finely etched relationships, memorable characters and an unforgettable 18-track soundtrack. When Murad finally says, Apna Time Aayega, you believe, for a brief moment in time, that you can also overcome the odds.  And what could be better than that? Writer-director Sharat Katariya's delightfully sensitive romantic drama, set in the Haridwar of 1995, is about a boy with low self-esteem and no achievements (Ayushmann Khurrana) who is compelled by his family to marry a smart, feisty, educated girl (Bhumi Pednekar) despite his objections to her plus-sized physique. The Harry Potter movies are the rare series to defy the notion that the books are always better. Rather than better or worse, the films were almost an extension of the books, wonderfully bringing to life JK Rowling's fantastical Wizarding World as the definitive franchise an entire generation grew up with. Based on the 2003 book by Cressida Cowell, the film tells the story of misunderstood teenager Hiccup, who is overlooked and underestimated by his warrior father, who forms an unlikely friendship with a dragon. How To Train Your Dragon is the perfect mix of beautiful animation, delightful characters, and a fantastic adventure rooted in the idea of empathy. Anurag Kashyap's Black Friday is more of a feeling – singularly shocking, stirring, cataclysmic, yet journalistic and depressingly objective, and one of the great achievements in Indian cinema. The reflective effect of this movie about the 1993 bomb blasts (based on Hussain Zaidi's superbly researched novel) was so powerful that nothing less than a TADA verdict forced the courts to certify its ""legality"". Vishal Bhardwaj's first film in his Shakespeare trilogy was an adaptation of Macbeth beautifully transposed to the Mumbai underworld. Maqbool was a triumph of casting with unforgettable performances from its ensemble of stalwarts like Irrfan Khan, Tabu, Pankaj Kapoor, Naseeruddin Shah and Om Puri. Shoojit Sircar's October is a thing of heart-breaking beauty. A boy (Varun Dhawan) coasts through life aimlessly until random tragedy strikes, taking over his life in ways he doesn't quite understand leaving him forever changed. An unshakeable portrait of pain and trauma, Honey Boy is based on Shia Labeouf's adolescence as a child actor with an abusive father, which sees the actor play the role of his father. Director Alma Har'el brings a sense of delicacy to a painful story that leaves you better off for having watched it. Bong Joon Ho's history-making take on class warfare and family strife was carefully crafted suspense at its best resulting in a rare movie that is as layered as it is accessible. A delicious Bollywood-ish tale follows the love story of Rachel (Constance Wu) and Nick (Henry Golding). The twist being that Nick is actually the son of one of the richest families in the world. Let the lavish, gorgeous chaos ensue. Six uncomfortably hilarious fables of revenge play out in this Argentinian anthology from writer-director Damián Szifron which escalates relatable grudges into tales of apocalyptic revenge. One of the most impactful, immersive war movies of all time, Steven Spielberg's cinematic achievement takes us as close to the front line as possible offering a human take on the chaos of war. Shimit Amin's iconic sports drama remains every bit the achievement it was when it came out, giving us one of Hindi cinema's greatest underdog stories led by an unforgettable SRK as Kabir Khan."
"Oct 9, 2020",POSITIVE," t begins with a flashback to one of the most pivotal scenes in the first film – elaborating on the apparent demise of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) the wizard, as he fought off the deathly advances of a fiery demon in the underground dwarf mine graveyard. Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and his faithful hobbit companion Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) continue their perilous, protracted journey to Mordor, where they hope to destroy a powerful ring that threatens to empower the villainous sorcerer Saruman (Christopher Lee). In turn, Saruman plots to resurrect the ancient evil of the dark lord Sauron, whose spiritual entity resides within the golden halo, hellbent on conquering Middle Earth. Pursuing a band of cannibalistic orcs that have captured two additional hobbits, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), are the remnants of the fellowship of the ring: the elf Legolas Greenleaf (Orlando Bloom), the human Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), and the dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies). Meanwhile, as Saruman’s armies cut a swathe of death and destruction through the peaceful countryside, several human soldiers of the kingdom of Rohan are marked as traitors and banished from the realm. Eomer (Karl Urban), their leader, commands a slaughter of the orcs, further displacing Merry and Pippin, who escape into the woods only to encounter the chief shepherd of the forest, a branch and leaf-covered giant called Treebeard. As the human population dwindles under Saruman’s massacres, survivors flock to Helm’s Deep, a stronghold of 300 warriors that appears hopelessly outnumbered by the army of more than 10,000 barbarian troops marching to annihilate the fortress. This immediate sequel to the hugely successful “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings” ups the ante on special effects, featuring outstanding computer animation of the Gollum character, which was only briefly glimpsed in the first film. His bodily movements, facial contractions, and split-personality voice-work are greatly attributable to actor Andy Serkis and his motion-capture expertise. Treebird is equally impressive, along with his throng of Ents, as well as the extra footage of the Balrog and Nazgul dragons. Once again, the orc and goblin makeup effects and costuming are sublimely realized; sets and props also continue to contribute to the overall visual appeal. Unfortunately, the stunts are slightly more reliable on CG, too, causing them to be less rousing and convincing. The hobbits remain clumsy, recklessly impulsive, and now at odds with one another, creating their own additional dilemmas, while numerous other haphazardly crafted circumstances prolong the penetration of Mordor’s walls. The inclusion of King Theoden (Bernard Hill) of Rohan, the death of his son, the evacuation of his city, and the demonic possession of his soul offer little to strengthen or deepen the persevering main characters. Correspondingly, the supporting role of servant Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif) is the least inspiring sub-villain in the series, designed without the usual subtlety of evildoers who have yet to reveal their misdeeds. Instead, he’s so clearly monstrous that his feigned allegiance borders on insulting to the audience (his name is similarly ridiculous). Arwen’s (Liv Tyler) later pilgrimage away from Rivendell also drags. Without an explanation of the afterlife or the beliefs surrounding it, save for a hinting at a god or gods governing Gandalf’s reappearance, the winning return of the unclearly powerful wizard appears as yet another contrived plot point. It’s one of several that spring up during this middle chapter of the trilogy, which already feels weighty with the slow progression of the story. And flashbacks are even more prevalent than in the previous movie, designating a signature narrative technique director Peter Jackson favors throughout the series. But the climactic battle of Helm’s Deep – though it still leaves much to be resolved for the final part – is a breathtakingly colossal skirmish in the rain and mud and fog, of nearly indescribable magnitude, involving hundreds of extras and stunning action choreography, which takes place concurrently with the comparably epic, redemptive storming of Saruman’s tower.

"Feb 28, 2020",POSITIVE,"Call it a pretty good film and I'll agree with you. Call it a great one, and I will beg to differ."
"Jun 18, 2019",POSITIVE,It also has... layers of political dynamics going on which I actually thought was pretty interesting.
"May 10, 2019",POSITIVE,The Two Towers succeeds like few other middle installments do in serving as both a satisfying benchmark that ties the introduction and conclusion to this trilogy together.
"Jan 14, 2019",POSITIVE," I’ll never forget the sunny afternoon that I spotted Andy Serkis on the imaginatively named “Main” street of “Grey” town during the height of The Lord of the Rings madness. I would’ve been about 11, and he was wandering quietly through the shops. It was him! Smeagol. Gollum. A man from the movies, plodding through my own little comfortable Shire where I had carefully mapped out the boundaries of my world from the town pools, to the school playground, to the chicken and chips shop. Try as I might, I can’t deny the impact that The Lord of the Rings had on my childhood spent in the South Wairarapa, the frequent stomping ground for Middle Earth’s finest celebrities. Andy Serkis was kind and obliging when I ran up to him, even recording the Voicemail message on my Nokia 3315 as Gollum. You’d constantly hear whisperings of Sean Astin and Elijah Wood hitchhiking in gumboots, or Orlando Bloom sipping coffee outside a dinky cafe. Every weekend, driving over the Rimutaka Hill to Mum’s house, I’d peep into the Hutt Valley and see glimpses of Isengard and Helm’s Deep. But then came age and cynicism and the big embarrassing statues at the airport and weird news stories about Andy Serkis being a sex demon. I coolly distanced myself, opting for the occasional drunken university LOTR marathon and trudging into the Hobbit films like it was out of national obligation rather than personal choice. I wasn’t a fan because I wasn’t a NERD. Sure, I did the Tongariro Crossing and posed like a hobbit next to Mount Doom, but wouldn’t you? Sure, I did a solo tour through Weta just last year, but haven’t you? Sure, I’m going to Hobbiton in two weeks time, but aren’t you? “And where sickness thrives, bad things will follow.” Aka, it’s Saturday morning and I’m, naturally, extremely hungover. I want to think I look like radiant Galadriel, but I truly, madly, deeply, look like the boil-covered Goblin King and there are no two ways about it. There’s mould on the ceiling and we have a house inspection on Monday, but I’m in denial about having to clean it. I put on the first Hobbit and get reacquainted with my old friends Oin, Gloin, Tenderloin and Bitcoin. And Smeagol! And the wizard with bird poo in his hair!  More reasons to watch: Two rock monsters have a massive fight next to a treacherous cliff face. Bret MacKenzie returns as FIGWIT and it’s about as jarring as Ed Sheeran in Game of Thrones but it’s still good. The dwarves sing one song that is absolute tunage and one song which would get you kicked out of a dinner party. Lee Pace is extremely, extraordinarily attractive as a blonde elf. Bilbo’s kitchen looks like Amano decor and that’s just the cold hard trews.  The mould isn’t entirely gone, but I’ve managed to find my extremely rare gold coin from Smaug’s actual lair and eaten a whole bag of chips. Look, this movie is all about Smaug. Gorgeous Smaug. Opulent Smaug. Smoking hot Smaug. As Bilbo darts around the golden lair trying not to get burned to a crisp, a fierce debate arises on our couch about how best to kill a dragon. I think I would look at Smaug and say “freeze” and then “blink if you love me.” Smaug would have to keep his eyes open and then I would spear him through the brain. If he blinks, then I guess we fall in love and it would be like the happy ending of Shrek. I’d be rich too. A win-win, really.  More reasons to watch: Benedict Cumberbatch doing the absolute most. The bit where the dwarves jump in barrels and go down lazy, orc-filled log flume. Evangeline Lilly being more beautiful than Cinderella. The first utterance of “man flesh”. Stephen Fry’s dramatic facial hair.  If you like battles, this film has heaps of them. If you like armies, this one has at least five. At a positively balmy two and a half hours, this is a beautiful digestif to finish off the first day of your marathon. “And if we die tonight, we’ll all die together,” I whisper to my beloved, as we press play on the third instalment. I’m particularly charmed by the dark twist on Disney on Ice, aka Thorin Fights Azog to the Death on Ice. A great, scary, chilly fight scene.  More reasons to watch: Billy Connolly is my dad and it’s rude to my family if you don’t acknowledge that. Christopher Lee (RIP) has very long fingernails in one scene and it’s disrespectful to his memory if you don’t. It’s the first time we see Mithril (must be said with a whisper) in the franchise and it’s disrespectful to all the mithril artisans of Middle Earth if you don’t. I feel like The Hobbit trilogy was the meat and potatoes part of the binge and LOTR is delicious dessert all the way down. Every time I watch The Fellowship, I see something new. Sure, it’s extremely hilarious when Gandalf hits his head on the ceiling of the small hobbit house, but have you ever noticed how cool he looks with half his hair tied up and half his hair down? Ever noticed how The Ring is like the goddamn size of a bangle at the start? Ever realised that the stone trolls the hobbits bump into were the LIVE trolls in The Hobbit??? More reasons to watch: Frodo’s face every time he nearly slips over to the shadow realm. Arwen and Aragorn being the love story of our times. The terrifying might of Lurtz and the endless wonder of this photo. “If you want him, come and claim him.” Boromir getting nailed with a bow and arrow 400 times. “Fly you fools.” Second breakfasts. Elevensies. “Fool of a took.” God, it’s good. I think this one might be the actual best of the franchise and it’s all because of the Ents. The enormous, magical, kinda pissed off trees are a glorious addition, least of which because I’ve written an entire, never-to-be-performed comedy special about them. What’s an Ent’s favourite sunglass brand? Oakleys. Why did the Ent get kicked out of the magic show? He was a plant. What did one Ent say to the other Ent? Stop throwing shade. If you don’t think any of that is funny, then you’ll at least get a kick out of the Rasta Ent who dips his flaming dreads in the burst dam. More reasons to watch: Robyn Malcolm is back, baby. “Man flesh” pt. deux. Legolas skateboarding down the stairs on his shield. Seeing Smeagol properly for the first (in terms of release) time ever. Gandalf’s extreme glow-up. When Gimli gets Aragorn to toss him (problematic?). The unbridled joy of Merry and Pippin. The beautiful white horse. The bloody Oliphaunt. I’ll admit that around the one hour mark of ROTK, I turned to my beloved and I said: “who is the king?” Partially, my brain was cooked because I’d been inside all weekend. Partially, I’d bleached my remaining brain cells cleaning the last of the mould. But mostly, I firmly believed that Éowyn is the real king. A feminist hero. A Joan of Arc. An Amanda Bynes in She’s the Man. At a whopping, hilarious, 4.20 duration for the extended version, Return of the King is the Oscar-winning, magnum opus of the franchise. If you’ve ever drunkenly held up a lighter while slurring “Gondor calls for aid,” this film is like coming home. If you are yet to do that classic gag, you are very, very, welcome to use it. Nobody laughs and you singe your hair. More reasons to watch: Sheelob is the most disgusting big spider I have ever seen with my own two eyes. The stink army of green ghouls is iconic. The avalanche of skulls gave me a nightmare immediately afterwards. Minas Tirith looks like a pure Melancholia pristine lawn perfection."
"Jan 10, 2016",POSITIVE," 


Before I start, I must confess that I have never read “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy (or “The Hobbit,” for that matter). So before any rabid Lord of the Rings fans pull out the torches and pitchforks to burn down my castle, I want to warn you that I don’t know squat about how “The Two Towers” compared to the book. In a word, “The Two Towers” is stunning. It is truly a masterpiece. Better than the first film, “The Two Towers” delivers a powerful story of fighting against insurmountable odds. Like the other legendary epic films of the 20th century, “The Lord of the Rings” is shaping up to be a trilogy to live on in movie history. Where “The Fellowship of the Ring” was clearly Frodo’s movie, “The Two Towers” spends more time with Aragorn (a human), Gimli (a dwarf) and Legolas (an elf). The fellowship is now broken, with Gandalf presumed dead and three parts scattered across Middle Earth. Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and his fellow hobbit Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) are the keepers of the all-powerful ring created by the Dark Lord Sauron to control Middle Earth. Now broken off from the group, Frodo and Samwise continue towards Mount Doom, where they can finally dispose of the ring properly. However, along their way, they pick up a companion – a wiry, gangly creature named Gollum. Once in possession of the ring, Gollum now joins the two hobbits to (maybe) see the end to “my precious.” Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies ) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) are in pursuit of an army of uruk-hai (genetically transformed orcs, for the uninitiated) that have kidnapped the other two hobbits, Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan). Along the way, the three heroes meet up with Gandalf (Ian McKellen, now promoted to Gandalf the White), who has been resurrected to help finish his quest. The fractured fellowship heads to the city of Rohan and befriends the king. They stay with the Rohan to help defend this last vestige of humans from the 10,000-strong uruk-hai army. Even though it is a three-hour film, “The Two Towers” doesn’t waste any time getting into the story. Where the “The Fellowship of the Ring” had a nifty little intro section in which Cate Blanchett explained all the hubbub about the rings and their powers, “The Two Towers” just dives right into the film. Not that this is a bad thing, but if you’re memory’s a bit fuzzy, you might want to rent “The Fellowship of the Ring” and watch it again before you go to this sequel. Not only does director Peter Jackson waste no time getting into the film, he wastes no time at all. In fact, this three hour epic is one of those few films where you leave feeling they could have spent even more time with story explanation and exposition. The film is so jam-packed with excitement, story and characters that some of the faces you’ve seen in the first film are mere flashbacks in this one. Actors like Liv Tyler (as the princess Arwen), Cate Blanchett (as the forest queen Galadriel) and Hugo Weaving (as the elf king Elrond Peredihl) have only bit parts here. But this doesn’t detract from the film. In fact, there’s so much in “The Two Towers” that you’ll need to not just invest three hours in it – but six or even perhaps nine – to absorb everything it has to offer. The incredible battle sequences are breathtaking, producing armies in the thousands to fight against one another, filling the entire screen. Additional special effects kudos are due for the creature Gollum, which is completely computer generated. The technology has grown so much over the years that it is able to emote almost at the level of a real actor. At times, it is so very easy to forget that Gollum is just a smattering of pixels because he blends so well into the background and feels so real. Bringing CGI into the 21st century, Gollum isn’t the annoying mess that was Jar Jar Binks. Of course, there could have been more of the character of Saruman the White, simply for the fact that he is played by the unbeatable Christopher Lee. Strangely, the flashes back to Saruman’s stronghold in Orthanc, seem the most enjoyable with Lee’s presence overseeing the creation of the uruk-hai army. Perhaps one of the best sequels ever made, “The Two Towers” stays true to the first film simply because it was filmed simultaneously (along with the third film). This way, the production design, characters and feel is completely seamless. The only film to come this close to the look and feel of the original is “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.” With a more satisfying ending and a tremendous battle that makes “Braveheart” look like a group of kindergartners playing red rover, “The Two Towers” whets the appetite for the final film, “The Return of the King.” Thank god we only have to wait a year. "
"Nov 12, 2014",POSITIVE," Peter Jackson's The Two Towers (aka 'Look Who's Tolkien Too') makes no concession to those unacquainted with the first part of the trilogy, The Fellowship of the Ring, other than to reprise the wizard Gandalf's spectacular fall into the pit of Khazad-dûm. He expects us to know, at least in general terms, the tale of some decent folk in Middle-Earth embarking on a dangerous quest to place the One Ring beyond reach of its wicked creator by consigning it to the Fire of Doom in the process and to defeat the evil schemes of the megalomaniac wizard Saruman (the commanding Christopher Lee). So from the start the chief heroic characters of the first part are split into three separate groups that will not meet again in this episode. This leads to occasional confusion but produces pace and variety. In the first strand, the leading hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and his devoted squire Sam (Sean Astin) meet the treacherous hominoid Gollum (one of the influences presumably for Dobby in Harry Potter), who becomes their guide. In the second, the warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen looking, sounding and swashbuckling like Errol Flynn), the pawky Scottish dwarf Gimli and the Elf archer Legolas, ride to the defence of the embattled King Theoden (Bernard Hill). The third strand features the two lesser hobbits, Pippin and Merry, who are protected by Treebeard, a splendid walking tree out of Arthur Rackham who gets a good laugh from the line 'What is a hobbit?' Treebeard commands a company of fellow giant trees and, in addition to delivering a discreet eco-message about deforestation (another of Saruman's sins), they prove formidable fighters. Discovering that their bite is worse than their bark, Pippin and Merry lead their arboreal allies in a Dunsinane-style assault against the evil empire. There is no girl in any of these three groups and the film finds little work for its heroines. (This is also the case in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, where Hermione is also marginalised.) Certainly there is nothing like the elf maiden Arwen's marvellous equestrian rescue of Frodo, a major highlight of the earlier picture. Their job is to flee with the children and the old folk. When the beautiful aristocratic Eowyn (Miranda Otto) wants to take up arms she is upbraided by her uncle, King Theoden, who believes that the fighting should be left to the men. And God knows there is plenty of it. This film packs enough battles into three hours to keep the residents of Valhalla talking for a year. Even the peaceful elf community decides to join the humans in the war against the totalitarian Sauron, apparently abandoning their old separatist slogan 'We Our Elves'. Five-digit hordes, mostly digitally created, go into battle every couple of minutes, with losses that even on the Western Front (JRR Tolkien had first-hand knowledge as an infantry officer) would have been extreme. The battles and sieges are conducted with the ferocity of the Crusades, Agincourt and Stalingrad and they are led up to and orchestrated in a manner that recalls the great movie epics of Fritz Lang and Sergei Eisenstein. These sequences are breathtaking, as indeed is much of a beautifully designed and photographed film that draws for its visual style on Caspar David Friedrich, the Pre-Raphaelites, Art Nouveau illustrations for children's books and the apocalyptic biblical landscapes (all flaming mountains, lightning and floods) of the Victorian visionary John Martin. The New Zealand settings have a rugged, primeval grandeur, though there are too many swooping helicopter shots over the landscape. Setting the second Harry Potter film beside this second Tolkien confirms with even greater clarity the difference detected between the two enterprises when the first movies appeared together a year ago. Though both are eclectic in their mythic and literary sources, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is to The Two Towers what glossy pantomime versions of Robinson Crusoe and Aladdin are to the Daniel Defoe novel and the Arabian Nights stories. These Tolkien films have a weight and seriousness that very few sword-and-sorcery pictures of the past 30-odd years have attained. (John Boorman's Excalibur is the most obvious exception and The Lord of the Rings was a cherished project of his that he was unable to get off the ground in the early Seventies.) The Two Towers can even stand the self-referential speech at the end by brave, honest hobbit Sam, about the force of mythic tales of good against evil, in which he wonders whether he would be worthy of figuring in such a saga himself. There is, along the way, as you might expect from a legendary tale, much topical resonance with references both fortuitous (two towers under attack) and expected (the belief that evil is abroad and that there are things worth fighting for) to current concerns. The movie, with narrative justification and commercial canniness, concludes with a cliffhanger that aims to have us sitting in the same seats a year hence to see how it all turns out in the concluding episode, The Return of the King. This is likely to be happier, more decisive and infinitely more satisfying than anything that will happen to our world in the next 12 months."
"Nov 12, 2014",POSITIVE," Like a mighty glacier on the move, a tripartite enterprise of such epic yearnings as Lord of the Rings needs time and patience for its impact to register. First time round, I was a sceptic. Such protracted introductions, so many characters, and what unpronounceable names .... I was not a happy fanof JRR Tolkien. But after a year's intermission, I emerged a convert from Part Two - shattered, shaken, stirred, even worshipful. It has a grandeur that it's not hyperbole to call Miltonic. Moreover, though it's no incitement to cinema-going, the film has collected a fearful dread from the way the world has gone since 9/11. Peter Jackson's film, unplanned though it was, now looks like a prophetic allegory for Osama bin Laden's messianic threats to world order as well as the besieged resistance of the great and the small. Even the sub-title The Two Towers involuntarily recalls the Twin Towers. Lines like ""A new power is coming, its victory is at hand"" or ""There will be no dawn for men"" or ""War is upon us"" have gained the resonance of fundamentalism that overlays cinematic fantasy. Fortunately, if the world is spared, it's the fantasy that will prevail. What an eyeful it is. This is probably the greatest battlepiece composed for the screen since Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible. Computergenerated imagery now adds its own genetic wonders to the elves, giants, humans and multispecies combatants. Tusked mastodons lumber over the field of battle with howdahs like minarets on their backs housing the avant-garde troops. A winged pterodactyl with a sinister cowled rider in the saddle flaps over the ramparts like a malevolent spotter aircraft. Wild boars as big and fierce as rampaging tigers attack the horse artillery. A huge dam splits asunder in a flood that makes Cecil B DeMille's famous parting of the Red Sea look like a piddling trickle. And then there's the final battle of Helm's Deep, the fortified keep of the King of Rohan that Saruman, the wicked wizard, puts to the siege ... Gustave Dore's great engravings of Paradise Lost look as if they've been given the gift of life as huge armies clash by night. You can believe that there are 10,000 men on screen at once. All manner of munitions, from land harpoons to scaling ladders 50-foot high and hung with invaders, reduce the implacable walls to rubble. New lands, new civilisations, new characters keep the fanciful parameters of Tolkien's world continually expanding into that private universe that constitutes the multi-part work's appeal. Probably, like me, you'll be groping through the first 20 minutes or so just to discover, or recall, who's who. Fear not. The story splits into four distinct parts as we follow each group of characters through a wonderland of necromancy where Graeco-Roman, Gothic, Pre-Raphaelite and Hollywood Medieval styles of culture and habitat all coexist with a bestiary of monsters and a pantheon of gods. Hobbits Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood, Sean Astin) push overland to destroy the baleful Ring that has cursed the world, and, en route, finally ensnare the skinny, near-naked Gollum that's been stalking them. This CGi creature is clearly a genetic relative of Star Wars' Yoda and a distant cousin of Harry Potter's Dobby. Completely computerised, though based on Andy Sergis's miming of his movements, he is a capering quadruped who, in return for sparing his life, leads them safely through a fearful swamp where dead warriors lie beneath the water - a Tennysonian image of eerie beauty. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), the dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and the blond bowman elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom) travel together and lift the dropsical curse placed on King Theoden (Bernard Hill) by the slimy enchanter Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). And as if all this weren't enough, Saruman (Christopher Lee) does his forecast of a Bin Laden figure as he sends his Uruk-hai legions marching into battle with a percussive tramp of iron-shod feet that is the film's most ominous keynote. The surprise guest in this extraordinary assortment, whose only common feature is their possession of more hairstyles than Afghanistan's former Taliban rulers could muster, turns out to be Gandalf the White (Ian McKellen). Last seen apparently spiralling to his doom in a bottomless pothole of flames, the wizard makes his comeback, unsinged and freshly laundered, in a whiter-than-white ensemble that alone strikes terror into the unwashed and unkempt enemies he confronts. If the mood of the movie is darker than Part One, and the stakes are higher, the story moves much more quickly from location to location. Admittedly, Tolkien's women, the Elf Queen Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) and the Elf Princess Arwen (Liv Tyler), still defeat Jackson's attempt to animate their stained-glass radiance. But few will worry. With The Two Towers, Tolkien's tapestry of Middle Earth's battle for survival has achieved a majestic proportion, chivalric and quixotic, earthly and magical, an experience that reaches beyond the dimensions of the cinema screen and somehow reflects the global unease of the world in the first years of the 21st century."
"Nov 12, 2014",POSITIVE," Is this the longest computer game in cinematic history? The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is like being trapped in a nerd's bedroom. Whenever you take a step toward the door, he cries: ""No, you must watch this bit, this really is amazing."" According to the distinguished critic Alexander Walker, the story ""moves much more quickly from location to location"" than in the first film. Since I left the cinema feeling as if I had got off a long-haul flight, I can only thank Providence that I missed part one. Certainly, the locations change from one slab of rock with a Lego castle and dry ice, to another. Perhaps this is to make up for the lack of movement in the characters. The only protagonist with any human range is Gollum, who is computer-animated. Equity must be getting nervous that an animated green house elf called Dobby is the star of Harry Potter and now Gollum is the only character worth watching in Lord of the Rings. More worrying than a geeky attachment to large armies and controlled explosions is the geo-political metaphor. The film is being described as a story for our times, post 9/11. I suppose Britain is where the hobbits come from and it is up to us to fight for Middle Earth. ""There is good in the world and it's worth fighting for,"" says Sam, the yokel hobbit. But after that, the metaphor becomes unsettling. Who are these hideous, alien races with terrible teeth? And what do walking trees have to do with it? I imagine that when male critics say they feel ""emotionally rewarded"" or even ""worshipful"" towards this film, it may be because men do rather well out of it. They look great in armour; they do not have to say much more than ""this is a good sword"" or ""let the battle begin""; they can fall off cliffs, wrestle with prehistoric beasts, fight off thousands of Orcs and remain shaven and unharmed. Women, on the other hand, are always being sent away. Liv Tyler floats off accompanied by folk music, and a spirited, if anaemic, blonde princess who takes a fancy to the warrior Aragorn (cue sword-play) is dispatched to a back passage with all the other toothless old women and grubby children. The dialogue is mystical and banal, the facial expressions stoned. And I cannot overemphasise the length of this film. It took Peter Jackson nearly six years to make the trilogy and you feel that you have been with him all the way. As The Two Towers lumbered towards its overblown climax, I shook my numb body and looked at my watch. The hobbits were heading towards a flame on the horizon, a little far off for my liking, but perhaps they could get a lift on one of those winged dinosaurs. The beautiful, brave menfolk were galloping over the hills. ""Are we nearly there yet?"" I asked my rapt 10-year-old son. Last year, I emerged from the preview of The Fellowship of the Ring with two principal thoughts: that this was the grandest, most spectacular piece of cinema I had ever seen; and that I would happily sit through it all over again. After watching the second instalment of the trilogy, The Two Towers, I had precisely the same response. What this film does is to repair the small faults of the first - the lengthy exposition, the humourless dialogue, the excess of hobbitish bucolia - and build on its strengths. The Two Towers feels even darker, grander and bolder than its predecessor; the pacing is braver; the fusion of real actors, animatronics and computer-generated imagery even more successful. Now, I should make two things clear. Although, as a child, I adored The Hobbit, the Lord of the Rings trilogy - and, in particular The Two Towers - seemed too big, too flabby, too much of a good thing. What's more, although I like on-screen belligerence as much as the next man, I have always found epic battles a formless, impersonal turn-off. But only the most inveterate wimp could fail to be moved by the climactic battle between the defenders of Rohan and the legions of Uruk-hai, at Helm's Deep: it lifts you from your comfy, popcorn-encrusted seat and hurls you into another time, place, and existence. The build-up is long, the tension almost unbearable, but it is worth the wait. Under raging storm-clouds, the 10,000 invaders try to penetrate the stone fortress. With a hideous, Spielbergian thud, they march up to it en masse; they send 80-foot ladders up to the ramparts; they blow a gaping hole in the wall, sending 10-ton stones raining down upon their own men. By cutting between magnificent, digitally aided sweeping shots of the scene, and individual (and very bloody) deaths, the director Peter Jackson makes you both participant and observer in a fantastical battle that leaves you gasping for breath. There's so much else to enjoy: the (very human) exchanges between the various protagonists; the surprisingly touching central performances - and the sublime villains; and, in particular, Gollum, an extraordinarily rich all-digital character who reminds you that Dobby - who appears in the second Harry Potter film - was nothing but an irritating, one-dimensional nerd."
"Nov 12, 2014",POSITIVE," The big question is: is The Two Towers up to the standard set by The Fellowship of the Ring? I have to tell you that the answer is: no. It's better - more spectacular, more exciting, more emotionally rewarding.  Not only is this head and shoulders above the other films of 2002; it is going to inspire a whole new generation of moviegoers and film-makers with the magic that only the cinema can create. It's fabulous and fantastic, in the truest sense of those words.  Unlike the first film where the narrative followed one group of characters, the story here divides into three: Frodo and Sam's journey towards Mordor, guided by the potentially treacherous Gollum; Merry and Pippin's abduction by the Uruk-Hai and their encounter with the inhabitants of Fangorn forest; and the attempt by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli first to rescue Merry and Pippin, and then to save Rohan and its bewitched King from the forces of Saruman.  The climactic event of The Two Towers, the seemingly hopeless defence of Helm's Deep against insuperable odds, is an outstanding, extended battle sequence that dwarfs any others on celluloid; but that is only the greatest of many wonders.  Several other action sequences would have made spectacular climaxes for any other movie - especially the Warg attack on the emigrants from Rohan, and the Ents' angry storming of Isengard.  One of the greatest services director Peter Jackson and his team have done to Tolkien is to grasp the importance of landscape. Most of Tolkien's finest writing lay in his descriptions of Middle Earth itself. Digital technology has added to the natural, unspoiled marvels of New Zealand, and created a world at once fantastical and familiar.  One of the many excellent aspects of Jackson's script, co-written with his wife Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyers and Stephen Sinclair, is that it supplies comic and romantic relief to go with all the action and grandeur.  Neither comedy nor women were Tolkien's strong points; and these enhancements are part of the reason why the films are destined to reach an even wider and more appreciative audience than the books.  Especially astounding is Jackson's attention to directorial detail. Two of the moments which make the heart leap are when the elf Legolas (a) gets on a horse and (b) travels down a staircase. These events may not read like much on the page, but thanks to Jackson's imagination they amount to two of the most stirring moments ever seen.  Those killjoys who dismiss The Lord of the Rings as mere escapism should stop to consider whether its tale of racial hatred, genocide, the corrupting nature of power, the need to stand against evil and yet guard against the temptation of using extreme force, isn't of greater relevance to the world of today than most films of so-called realism.  Theoden, King of Rohan (an Oscarworthy supporting performance by Bernard Hill) has to decide between isolationism and involvement in a way that is relevant to several modern Western leaders, especially those in France and Germany.  King of the Elves (superbly played by Hugo Weaving), has to resolve whether his people-have any further responsibilities to the world they are shortly to leave behind.  Gollum - a stunning breakthrough in computer animation, and wonderfully voiced by Andy Serkis - has to decide between his doglike devotion to Frodo (Elijah Wood) and his feral determination to steal back his ring.  These ethical dilemmas are treated with sensitivity and seriousness. Yet the pace of the storytelling never flags. This is the speediest three hours in the cinema I have ever experienced.  The quality of the acting is amazingly high. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn easily dons the mantle of epic hero that used to be worn by Charlton Heston, and he's a lot sexier.  The triangular love relationship between him, Arwen (Liv Tyler, acting better in Elvish than she ever has in English) and Eowyn, Theoden's niece (played by the beautiful Miranda Otto) is deftly and delightfully done. The rise of post- war cynicism and the decline of the Western and the war film have not diminished the huge need in the popular cinema for heroes. In the Lord of the Rings trilogy, there is a whole range of heroes for anybody to identify with.  I know a few people who felt distanced and bored by The Fellowship of the Ring, but I'm afraid the failure lies in their power to appreciate it, not in the film itself.  Necessarily darker and more violent than its predecessor, it may be too overwhelming for those under eight. For the rest of us, it's an overwhelming experience, in a totally positive way. "
"Nov 12, 2014",POSITIVE,"Much of the movie is exciting. But none of it is as satisfying as what Jackson was able to create in Fellowship, the first film."
"Nov 12, 2014",POSITIVE," Frodo, played by Elijah Wood, feels the increasing burden of the One Ring in the central film of the epic trilogy, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers."" Without breaking stride, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" picks up briskly where last year's duly celebrated ""The Fellowship of the Rings,"" first chapter in director Peter Jackson's grandly ambitious adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's weighty literary trilogy, left off. Jackson presumably figured that no recap of the first chapter was needed to set this hotly anticipated new adventure off on its rousing, complicated way. And he's probably right since it appears only trolls in caves and the odd wandering Gollum are unfamiliar with Tolkien's deeply allegorical works, which have lately served as influence and inspiration for everyone from George Lucas and his ""Star Wars"" mythology on through J.K. Rowling and her wizard-laden Harry Potter books. ""The Two Towers,"" shot back-to-back with the first and third in Jackson's film trilogy, simply assumes moviegoers are up to speed and so plunges them without ceremony into the ongoing narrative that quickly veers off into three complex subplots. When last we saw young Hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), the reluctant Ringbearer, he was off with his spirited sidekick Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) into the wilds of Mordor to cast the cursed ring into the fires of hell. This film picks up their quest as the two Hobbits endure the harsh rigors of the journey and encounter a wily Gollum -- a mutated, reptilian Hobbit of the Stoor family -- who covets the ring as ""precious,"" but soon becomes their ally and unreliable guide. Another story thread tracks Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) as he travels with elfin archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and the blustery dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) to aid the noble men of Rohan as they defend the fortress citadel Helm's Deep against marauding hordes of goonish orcs set loose by the evil white wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee). A third storyline follows the captured Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) as they escape from the orcs and make their way through the Fangorn Forest. There, they ally with ancient talking-walking trees, led by the wizened, gnarled Treebeard (voiced by Rhys-Davies), to attack Saruman's stronghold of Isengard, where the villain has decimated the forest to fuel his rebel armies. Perhaps more aggressively than in the first film, Jackson (a New Zealander whose previous credits have ranged from the erratic horror outing ""The Frighteners"" to the chillingly good ""Heavenly Creatures"") reconfigures some of the book's plot elements, trims some scenes and characters, and transforms Tolkien's dense, image-heavy prose into a swift, brawny cinematic tale. Once again, the film runs nearly three hours, but for the most part it feels sharply focused and kinetic as it packs in just enough general exposition to inform non-readers while including plenty of smartly selective local color and arcane Tolkien lore to satisfy fans of the novels. On the technical side, Jackson's transition between films is seamless, and the sequel builds on the overall visual splendor of the first, with its painterly matte work and epic-scale set designs. In tone, this one is darker and more morose. It also might be argued that the battle scenes feel a bit overlong, overproduced and visually repetitive, but it's hard to argue with their thrilling impact. While the acting is once more solid throughout, even with the Shakespearean Ian McKellen given too little to do as the good wizard Gandalf, the most impressive performance of all comes from digital magicians who created the wretched Gollum, Smeagol (cunningly voiced by Andy Serkis). With his lizardly aspect, wispy grey hair and large expressive eyes, the tiny Smeagol is a feral creature of amazing comic and dramatic force. When he agonizes over his lowly plight or carries on schizophrenic dialogues between his inner angels and demons, he displays an amazing facility for expressing subtle emotions that puts some human actors in the shade. Surely it's the first time a computer-generated character has delivered such a truly gripping dramatic performance on screen. If the Oscar-nominated ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" was a self-contained wonder, ""The Two Towers"" is more reliant on familiarity with the first film and Tolkien's vast lore. That rare moviegoer who's unfamiliar with either will be lost in the wilderness here. However, Jackson and company did such a stellar job of establishing their claim on Tolkien's legacy with last year's film, it's doubtful ""The Two Towers"" will fail to thrill and amaze with its art and technical craft. With adventure two now squarely on the screen and the essential ""Lord of the Rings"" saga well and two-thirds told, fans can slowly begin to look forward to a satisfying conclusion with the release of ""The Return of the King"" next holiday season. Once again, anticipation is sweet."
"Nov 12, 2014",NEGATIVE," Is this the longest computer game in cinematic history? The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is like being trapped in a nerd's bedroom.

"Nov 12, 2014",POSITIVE,"While some people think this surpasses the original, I don't. The storylines are fractured and geographically and narratively it's sometimes hard to figure out what's going on... but the positives are many."
"Nov 12, 2014",POSITIVE," What are the Ents going to look like? That's the anticipatory cringe for any Tolkien fan faced with a film version of The Two Towers. The corresponding question in The Fellowship of the Ring – how on earth will they tackle wacky old Tom Bombadil? – was dealt with by simple excision, but the Ents are too central to the story to omit. It's perfectly possible to read The Lord of the Rings believing in Treebeard without ever having visualised him (is he an anthropomorphic tree, or a dendromorphic man?). There are a controlled number of humorous situations in this mostly very grim film, but any whiff of whimsy or silliness, like a fart at High Mass, would swiftly dispel the magic. So it's a relief to report that striding, creaking Treebeard, with his Archimboldo face composed of boles and mosses, is a satisfying creation: comical in his slowness, but also wise, and frightening. That Tolkienian note of holy awe, mixed with rustic humour, is very hard to pull off. Though the action in this second part of the trilogy moves decisively towards the world of men, the many ways of being not-human are fully explored. Problems of visualisation aside, the fundamental question at this half-way point is whether the director, Peter Jackson, can create an artistic whole out of the middle of the sandwich. Will the magnificent filling, pressed on both sides by the great crusts of ""the quest begins"" and ""the quest is ended"", just seem shapeless? No, the film is triumphant on its own terms. The narrative has an unstoppable forward thrust – it's not just a question, as in the Harry Potter sequel, of returning to a place we know and renewing our acquaintance with the strange folk there. The sundered Fellowship, split into three, pushes like a trident deeper into new and dangerous territory. For the first half of the original book, the reader is left in the dark about the fate of Sam and Frodo. They have disappeared from the text and from our ken, and when they next appear they seem isolated and scared. Jackson opts for a less daring, more conventionally cinematic way of telling the story, cutting rapidly between all three segments at once. This was perhaps an inevitable choice, and it certainly gives the action a reassuring narrative flow, but the effect is to leach much of the despair and loneliness out of the Hobbits' quest. Tolkien's great skill is to make you think, no matter how many times you re-read his book, that perhaps this time it won't work out after all. The message of the second book is There is no hope (but let's try anyway), and Jackson is faithful to this, but the wham-bam style of epic works against him. Jackson makes other artistic choices at variance with the book, but they rarely feel like violations. Most of them make you reassess the story, draw your attention to unnoticed subtleties. A few of the characters seem even richer, more profound than Tolkien's own conception. Viggo Mortensen finds an astonishing stillness and poise at the heart of Aragorn (he's a bit of a stiff in the novel). This deep love of peace is what drives him to fight, a paradox which makes him more kinglike than any other character. In brief divergence from the book, he's reunited, in memory or dream, with Arwen (is Liv Tyler's spade-like face actually getting longer with each instalment?). This lovely interlude softens the character, redresses an awkwardness in Tolkien, and breaks up the relentless militarism. Elijah Wood (Frodo) is visibly losing life force as the quest continues; drooping, swooning, a spooked and spooky figure. Gollum is a wonderful creation: voiced by Andy Serkis, and given the most heartbreakingly expressive face, he's far more than a digital effect: he's really there, taking up space, displacing air (part of the impact comes from the meticulous care with which all the creatures of Middle Earth are scaled relative to one another). Gollum is a vile mixture of servility and malice, yet watching him being beaten, throttled, kicked by almost everyone he encounters is as distressing as watching a child being hit. Frodo, for all his faults, is kind to Gollum, seeing in him his own disturbing likeness; Sam, for all his virtues, is cruel. Gollum has been corrupted by his ""precioussss"", but Jackson strikes an almost theological note in suggesting that his self-centred inability to forgive is really what's corroding him. There are several hazards which Jackson avoids. This episode, with its histrionic battle scenes and Viking fetishism, Middle Earth having a simultaneous bad hair day, could have degenerated into a heavy metal video aesthetic. As it is, only Faramir's shaggy perm seriously enters Spinal Tap territory. Another error would have been to make this a kind of postmodern pot-pourri of cinematic in-jokes. When Aragorn – missing, presumed very dead – turns up late for a battle, all Legolas (Orlando Bloom) says is: ""You're late."" That this hoary old line is delivered in Elvish redeems it. Gimli is reduced to a comic character – there's another discussion of when it's permissible to ""toss a dwarf"" – but there's otherwise nothing camp or arch to leaven the tense moral seriousness. The Two Towers is a satisfying and wholly gripping drama in its own right. Inevitably, Janus-like, it looks back to the Shire, and forward to the hour of doom. And after three hours, you will too."
"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE," As the opening credits of 2003 begin to roll, two big thunderers are slugging it out. ""Chicago"" is a musical and ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is three hours of epic; the garter belt is to one film what the horned helmet is to the other, although I shall not slake your curiosity by revealing which is which. Both films are to be commended for venturing into genres that were until recently viewed as dilapidated, vacant, and overpriced. All we need now is the return of the religious barnstormer, and the revival will be complete. Even as we speak, Ben Affleck may be combing his beard for the leading role of Jonah, with Nathan Lane as the whale. ""Chicago"" stars Catherine Zeta-Jones as Velma Kelly and Renée Zellweger as Roxie Hart. Each is a man-killer, and each resides in jail, plotting her defense with the silken legal help of Billy Flynn (Richard Gere). The time is, I would guess, the late nineteen-twenties, although the setting is so stylized, so shamelessly grounded in a hundred other shows and films, that ""Chicago"" barely qualifies as a period piece; indeed, it merrily jabs at the celebrity-lust of our own era. In the strongest and most biting number, Roxie perches on Billy's lap like a dummy—limbs turned to sticks, spots of red on her rounded cheeks—and chants the melodies that he, the attorney as ventriloquist, feeds into her mouth. Behind them, the ladies and gentlemen of the press jerk on wires, yanked from on high by a second Billy, and compete to do his bidding. As a musical demonstration of spin, it couldn't be meaner. The only hitch is that I cannot for the life of me name that tune. The songs in ""Chicago"" crash in one ear, barge around your brain for a minute or two, then make a swift exit through the other ear, never to be heard again. This may mark me as a Rodgers and Hammerstein junkie, but I can't help feeling that the fustiness lies with Kander and Ebb, whose music and lyrics operate on the old-fashioned principle that every song should be a showstopper, regardless of whether the show deserves to be stopped. As I left the movie, my skull was humming more than I was; much violence is perpetrated in the course of the plot, as each of the jailbirds recounts her capital offense, but the real harm is done to the senses of the people in the audience, who will find themselves in the unusual position of being snarled up in fishnets and assaulted by sequins. Is there anything, in art or in life, less sexy than the incorrigible, twenty-four-hour desire to trumpet one's sexiness to the world? We are meant to be blown away by the sultry airs of this picture, but the very surfeit of them spoils the plan. When Cyd Charisse laid an endless leg across the screen in the ""Broadway Ballet"" sequence of ""Singin' in the Rain,"" or when she and Fred Astaire offered a tribute to Mickey Spillane in ""The Band Wagon,"" we understood that the hardboiled style was already a soft target, and that the landscape of gumshoes, pimps, and dames with Louise Brooks hair styles had become a nice, pliable gag for choreographers. Yet here comes ""Chicago,"" almost half a century later, kitting its heroine out with a black bob and inviting us to take our randy noir straight up. Rob Marshall, the director, does his best to leave the stage show behind, but the cards are stacked against him, for ""Chicago"" is a pack of theatrical tricks. Whether it's the towering grid of prison bars or the huge red ""Roxie"" that flashes behind Renée Zellweger, we sense a flatness of dimension, a reluctance to stretch the story's depth of field. What Marshall does, by way of compensation, is to edit his way out of trouble, cutting away furiously during not only each song but almost every line of each song, as though not daring to presume that younger viewers will be able to stomach more than four and a half seconds of inviolate music. This is hectic on the eye and bad for the confidence; we start to wonder, ungallantly, about the camera's chronic wish to glance aside—could it be that the performers might not weather its unstinting gaze? A head-on scene of Gene Kelly tap-dancing is bliss, but the same view of Richard Gere is not kind. This is hardly Gere's fault; no skill is more baffling than tap—how can the staccato turn largo and liquid like that? Gere also strips to his underwear; whether he does this in the interests of gender equality or whether, for a practicing Buddhist, it is an established spiritual technique for paring life down to its essentials, I am not qualified to judge. The only player to conquer ""Chicago"" is Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is no Charisse in her motions but who gets by on a full tank of unleaded oomph. The film is hard, however, on Renée Zellweger. If there is any living star who could strap herself into heels like scalpels and then strut and bray, all by her lonesome, against a background of inky black, with the camera hunkered down ringside so that it can peer up her shimmering nano-dress, I can't name her. Many people will get off on the highs of this picture, but they might want to ask why there are no other levels. Musicals depend on the contest of innocence and experience, and we are just not culturally equipped to provide that mix anymore. Lovers of the classic form were prepared to believe that it was natural—more of a thirsty emotional need than a luxury—for a character to break into song, whereas nowadays that perversity has to be explained. Most of the numbers in ""Chicago"" are meant to unfurl within Roxie's imagination, and even then you can hear the grinding gear change as the action readies itself for a tune. I admire the punch of this movie, but not for a second, as the dancers wriggled and raged, did I get that delicious, redeeming sense that life can be lived on the hoof. Once you have clambered over the craggy title, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is a fairly easy ride. Never in three hours did I look at my watch, nor cast my eyes toward the sun as it westered unto the havens of Eriador. Around me rose a few clucks from confirmed Tolkienites, frustrated at the loss of a favorite line from the novel. Were the movie to map every detail of the Master's work, though, the result would not be three hours long. It would be three years long. In the event, the director, Peter Jackson, has crunched and tidied the book. Hundreds of pages pass, for example, in which the author allots so much space to Gimli (a dwarf), Legolas (an elf), and Aragorn (a real man) that we all but forget about Frodo and Sam, the hobbits bearing the Ring to its doom—in a volcano handily named Mount Doom, which must make it easy to ask for directions. Onscreen, Jackson braids the two strands together, adding the tale of fellow-hobbits Merry and Pippin, who, in a twist guaranteed to make environmentalists spill their carrot juice for joy, are literally hugged by trees. We also get flying dragons, a breathless opening sequence in which Gandalf (Ian McKellen) plummets down a belching abyss, and a flawless white horse that, if you give a little whistle, gallops in from nowhere, though only in slow motion. And lo, the name of this steed is Shadowfax, or, as it was told in the olden tongue, Palmpilot. Then, there is Gollum. Gollum, who guides Frodo on his quest, is white-skinned and blue-veined, like a moldering cheese, and his shrunken frame is topped by a triangular head with protruding eyes. Think of Ross Perot after ten years on the Atkins diet, and you're almost there. There are two problems with Gollum, who used to be known as Sméagol before he entered the witness-protection program. First, he gives the movie a chance for psychological inquiry—the one thing it doesn't require. ""The Lord of the Rings"" is an epic, and one of the defining restrictions—not to say pleasures—of epic is that it both predate and outwit psychology. Motives, good and ill, may be thwarted or confounded, but you don't read Tolkien for the niceties of tangled minds; you read him for pace and wonder, and the virtues of Jackson's trilogy, thus far, have been pace and astonishment, which is almost the same thing. Second, Gollum was forged on computer and planted inside the frame. Nobody could quibble with the vitality of the result, but there's the rub—his creators are so pleased with their baby that they can't help showing him off, and we get far more of his hisses and writhings than we need. This is a pity, and we may have to accept that, for those fooling around with brand-new technologies, the toys are simply too much fun. When you are the kind of exuberant artist, as Jackson is, who visualizes a giant tree that can both walk the walk and talk the talk, you can hardly be blamed if, in the deepest sense, you end up rooting for it.

"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE," Last year's The Fellowship Of The Ring, director Peter Jackson's first entry in his three-part adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord Of The Rings, provided little cause for complaint. At once thoroughly cinematic and faithful to the spirit (if not always the letter) of Tolkien's book, it presented Middle Earth as an immersive experience, a world in which every aspect is realized in minute detail. Fellowship made the impossible believable, and without draining the magical happenings, fantastical locations, and uncanny creatures of their wonder, it also never abandoned a sense of dramatic and thematic weight. As embodied by a well-chosen cast, Fellowship's characters had all the depth Tolkien gave them on the page (and sometimes more), and their quest to rid the world of a ring of absolutely corrupting power took on greater urgency as the film progressed toward a cliffhanger that set up its second part. To live up to expectations, The Two Towers only had to be as good as its predecessor–and, astoundingly, it's better. That's not simply a matter of exposition giving way to action, although the film has plenty, as soulful hobbits Elijah Wood and Sean Astin make their way toward Mordor, friends Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan find unlikely allies deep in a forest, and the dwarf/elf/human team of John Rhys-Davies, Orlando Bloom, and Viggo Mortensen attempts to defend a struggling kingdom from the forces of Christopher Lee. What makes Towers so staggering is the way it brings the full scope of Jackson's adaptation into focus. Without missing a beat in three hours, the film shifts from epic to lyrical and back. It portrays a harrowingly intense battle one moment, then pauses for a father's grief over his son's death the next. It shows in frightening detail the engines of war, then links those engines to the bloodshed they exact and the ecological destruction that made them possible. What Fellowship suggested, Towers elucidates. It's thrilling as swords clash and arrows fly, but it also never abandons the underlying sadness of Tolkien's world, in which each victory only forestalls the transition to a meaner age. (And, for all the attendant technophobia, it's another technical masterpiece. Gollum, voiced by Andy Serkis, may qualify as the first fully fleshed-out performance by a CGI effect.) Next year, The Return Of The King will bring the story to a close. Until then, it feels almost like a privilege to watch the unfolding of a tale from a fantastic imagined past rich with resonance for the human present. "
"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE," The Church publishes the Monitor because it sees good journalism as vital to progress in the world. Since 1908, we’ve aimed “to injure no man, but to bless all mankind,” as our founder, Mary Baker Eddy, put it. Here, you’ll find award-winning journalism not driven by commercial influences – a news organization that takes seriously its mission to uplift the world by seeking solutions and finding reasons for credible hope. The Monitor Daily amplifies and clarifies how we deliver on the Monitor’s purpose, to benefit humanity by reporting what is happening in the world and why – and how this information matters to you. ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" fits this pattern, taking Frodo Baggins into territory more frightening than anything he encountered in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" last year. ""The Two Towers,"" was made at the same time and woven from the same cloth as the other chapters in Peter Jackson's ambitious ""Rings"" project. The similarity of the three movies - the third opens next winter - will disappoint viewers looking for something different each time. But it ensures huge dividends for the filmmakers, now that the first installment has proved an over-the-top hit, with worldwide grosses of $860 million to date. I found ""Fellowship of the Ring"" pale compared with the imaginative sweep of Tolkien's books. Few readers agreed with me - you should see the angry mail I got - so I'm pleased to report that ""The Two Towers"" is better. One reason is Gollum, who dogs Frodo's trail because of his obsession with the magical ring Frodo is taking to Mordor so it can be destroyed before Sauron uses it to dominate Middle Earth forever. Gollum is treacherous and wicked, but he's also weak and pitiable. Jackson evokes these contradictory traits through one of the most ingenious computer-generated characters yet created. There's no need for the ponderous exposition that weighed down the first installment, since the filmmakers assume we've seen it. They give ""Towers"" a snappier ending, too, straining less hard to make it seem like both a single installment and a complete story in itself. The flat dialogue doesn't give the actors much to work with, but Liv Tyler and Ian McKellen make strong impressions. And then there's Gollum, voiced by Andy Serkis, whose live performance was the basis for the computer graphics. Most moviegoers will leave buzzing about the climactic Battle of Helm's Deep. But in my eyes, this is Gollum's show more than anyone else's, even the special-effects wizards behind the scenes. Monitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in. We believe news can and should expand a sense of identity and possibility beyond narrow conventional expectations."
"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE,The battle for Gollum's mind also provides a fitting teaser conclusion to the second act of a story I'm beginning to wish would never end.
"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE,"The Two Towers was always going to be the toughest book to adapt, yet Peter Jackson pulls it off. Part Two is easily as exciting, involving and visually inventive as Part One."
"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE,"It's darker and more urgent than the opening segment, and Jackson again displays an unparalleled grasp of storytelling on a grand scale."
"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE,"Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a pitch-perfect second act, full of dark wonder and the slow, pounding pulse of Aragorn's unflagging hope."
"Nov 19, 2013",NEGATIVE,Any sort of compelling story gets lost amidst all the spectacle.
"Nov 19, 2013",POSITIVE,"Part two is more a straight-ahead action flick, substituting brawn and brawling for the pastoral radiance of the first film."
"Dec 9, 2012",POSITIVE,Marches along with considerably more assurance and smoothness than the desperately crammed Fellowship.
"Sep 13, 2012",POSITIVE," THE ARISTOCATS (1970) / THE RESCUERS (1977) / THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER (1990) / POCAHONTAS (1995). Before the disastrous Aughts, was there a worse decade for Disney animated features than the 1970s? Even the relatively bare '60s had the marvelous 101 Dalmatians to elevate its average, and the 1980s was largely saved by the last-minute appearance of 1989's The Little Mermaid, which of course launched a new golden age of Disney classics. The '70s began with The Aristocats, a limp Lady and the Tramp reworking that finds Eva Gabor voicing the pampered Duchess and Phil Harris speaking for the street-savvy O'Malley. Duchess and her kittens will inherit the fortune of their wealthy owner after she passes away, a development that leads the woman's butler to get rid of the felines so that he will inherit as the secondary beneficiary. O'Malley and his band of jazz-playing alley cats come to their rescue, as do assorted other animals. But except for a pair of country hounds named Napoleon and Lafayette, these critters are alternately irritating (a mouse, two geese) or downright dull (a horse). The ""Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat"" sequence is a showstopper, and the butler's run-ins with the dawgs are amusing, but this is otherwise forgettable stuff. I'll go ahead and acknowledge that I'm probably in the minority when it comes to The Rescuers. A sizable box office success all over the world — it reportedly made more than the same year's Star Wars in some countries — it's since been a popular seller on VHS and DVD and will likely fare well on Blu-ray as well. Yet the movie moves like molasses, as the heroic mice Bernard (voiced by Bob Newhart) and Bianca (Eva Gabor again) square off against the fearsome Madame Medusa (Geraldine Page) in order to rescue the orphan girl Penny from her clutches. There's some colorful action set in the aptly named Devil's Bayou, and I dug the character of Evinrude the dragonfly. But the songs aren't up to par (nevertheless, ""Someone's Waiting for You"" earned a Best Original Song Oscar nomination), Madame Medusa comes off as a cut-rate Cruella De Vil (no surprise, since the 101 Dalmatians villainess was at one point discussed for this picture), and Newhart's Bernard ranks as one of Disney's dullest toon protagonists. The Rescuers was the first Disney toon flick to inspire a sequel, and the good news is that The Rescuers Down Under is better than its predecessor. Here, Bernard and Bianca travel to Australia to rescue a boy who's being held captive by a poacher intent on nailing an eagle that the lad has befriended. The film's Aussie setting (unusual for an animated film) adds some interest, as do the spirited vocal characterizations by George C. Scott as the ruthless poacher and John Candy as a friendly albatross. Although it was released in the year between The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, it's never been considered part of the Disney renaissance, and its limp box office helped convince the studio to release all future sequels straight to the home market. Alongside all these underachievers, Disney has thankfully chosen to release one winner to Blu-ray. Pocahontas tells the story of the real-life Native American heroine (voiced by Irene Bedard, with Judy Kuhn handling the songs) and her (fictionalized) romance with British sea captain John Smith (Mel Gibson). If nothing else, the movie features my all-time favorite Disney tune: the gorgeous, Oscar-winning ""Colors of the Wind,"" at once timeless (in its hopeful theme of harmony among all creatures as well as with nature itself) and timely (the line ""You think the only people who are people are the people who think and look like you"" should be the catchphrase for every Republican National Convention). Yet the movie has other virtues as well: an Oscar-winning score by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz, ofttimes staggering animation, and appreciated (but not obtrusive) comic relief from a mischievous raccoon named Meeko. The Aristocats is sold individually, while The Rescuers and The Rescuers Down Under are paired in one set. Pocahontas unfortunately shares its edition with the 1998 straight-to-video sequel Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World. Blu-ray extras on The Aristocats include the deleted song ""She Never Felt Alone""; a piece on songwriters Robert and Richard Sherman; a music video for ""Oui Oui Marie""; and the Minnie Mouse cartoon Bath Day. Blu-ray extras on the Rescuers twofer include the deleted song ""Peoplitis""; a Rescuers Down Under making-of featurette; the live-action short Water Birds; and the animated short The Three Blind Mouseketeers. Blu-ray extras on Pocahontas include the deleted song ""If I Never Knew You""; deleted scenes; a featurette on the music; and the animated short Little Hiawatha. BATTLESHIP (2012). This massively budgeted, heavily hyped and supremely awful summer flop could easily be mistaken for a Transformers sequel except that it's missing Shia LaBeouf's distinct hairdo. Peter Berg, who used to be a mediocre actor before morphing into a mediocre director, apparently wants to be the new Michael Bay (oh, for a time when filmmakers looked up to Hitchcock and Hawks instead!), and I guess give him credit for succeeding. With awful dialogue, dull characterizations and snooze-inducing visual effects — yeah, I'm not so proud that I can't admit to uncharacteristically dozing off for a few minutes during one of the endless battle sequences — Battleship is the sort of mindless mayhem that's defended by fans as ""perfect popcorn entertainment."" Sure, if you like your popcorn burnt and sticking to the bag. But to tag this a worthy blockbuster is the equivalent of spitting in the faces of Steven Spielberg, Robert Zemeckis, James Cameron or any other filmmaker who used to expertly do this sort of thing on a regular basis. A virtual remake of last year's piss-poor Battle: Los Angeles, this adds aliens to the board game template, with our military might going up against dastardly e.t.'s bent on destroying the world — or, more importantly, the American way of life. Battleship was a massive bomb at the U.S. box office (it did just fine internationally), but it might fare better at home, since it's jingoistic nonsense that shamelessly panders to every demographic — teen boys will ogle at the special effects (and at former Charlottean Brooklyn Decker), young women will dig hunks Taylor Kitsch and Alexander Skarsgard (playing unlikely brothers), R&B fans will be excited at the prospect of Rihanna making her film debut (the verdict: meh), and older viewers who should know better will feel all warm and faux-patriotic when the film drags out geriatric naval officers to help fight the invaders. As far as I know, this is only the second movie that's been based on a board game, with Clue having paved the way back in 1985. Let's hope they wait another 27 years before bringing a third one to the screen — it'll take that long to mentally prepare myself for a celluloid take on Hungry Hungry Hippos or Parcheesi. Blu-ray extras include video commentary by Berg; an alternate ending previsualization; a featurette on the visual effects; looks at shooting at sea and on the USS Missouri; a tour of the USS Missouri; and a short piece on the cast. BERNIE (2012). Bernie finds Jack Black playing the same type of character essayed by Zach Galifianakis in The Campaign: a friendly, respectable and slightly effeminate Southerner who's greatly admired by those around him. The difference, though, is that The Campaign is a fictional piece while Bernie is based on a true story. Working from a Texas Monthly article by Skip Hollandsworth, director Richard Linklater re-teams with his The School of Rock star for this quirky piece about Bernie Tiede, a mortician residing in the town of Carthage, Texas. Bernie's method of treating everyone with courtesy and respect extends to Marjorie Nugent (Shirley MacLaine), a loathsome widow with no friends but lots of material wealth. Bernie strikes up a friendship (or something more?) with the elderly woman and they soon become inseparable, which is fine until Bernie starts to feel more like Marjorie's possession than her BFF. But does he emotionally break down enough to kill her in a second of spontaneous and regrettable rage, or was he planning to murder her all along so that he may enjoy her riches? The sympathetic townspeople opt for the former; the local district attorney (Matthew McConaughey) votes for the latter. Writing the screenplay with Hollandsworth, Linklater uses dollops of black humor to provide an edge to this morally ambiguous piece that asks viewers to weigh not only whether one awful deed can overshadow a lifetime of charitable service but also whether there was any appropriate punishment that would suit this particular crime. (This is assuming the real-life Bernie is as likable as his celluloid counterpart; as filmed, Linklater is clearly on his side.) MacLaine and McConaughey are only required to strike the same note repeatedly (grouchy and grandstanding, respectively), but Black is excellent in the central role. Incidentally, the real Bernie Tiede pops up during the closing credits. Blu-ray extras include a behind-the-scenes featurette; deleted scenes; a piece on the true-life story that inspired the film; and a look at the Carthage residents through interviews and audition pieces. THE FIVE-YEAR ENGAGEMENT (2012). It would be both obnoxious and inaccurate to quip that The Five-Year Engagement feels as if it runs as long as the titular length, but there's no denying that this is one movie that would have benefitted from some judicious trimming in the editing room. At 125 minutes, the latest comedy from the director (Nicholas Stoller), star (Jason Segel) and producer (who else but Judd Apatow) of the superior Forgetting Sarah Marshall doesn't sound especially long — it's the exact same running time as the Apatow-produced Bridesmaids, which was the perfect length. Yet by unleashing most of its best gags during the first act, and by sprinkling its dramatic moments around like a sous chef adding just a soupcon of parsley to an order of grilled trout, that leaves plenty of time for the film to develop a noticeable sag around the middle. Speaking of sous chefs, that's the role essayed by Segel: He plays Tom Solomon, a highly respected member of San Francisco's culinary scene. His girlfriend is Violet Barnes (Emily Blunt), and it's only after he pops the question that Violet is beckoned to the University of Michigan for a postdoctoral position. Deciding to put his own career on hold while she builds hers, Tom agrees with Violet that they should postpone the wedding for two years and move to Ann Arbor. Tom, who can only find work at a deli, hates living there, and when it looks like the two years might stretch into something longer, he loses it in rather imaginative fashion. The late film critic Pauline Kael famously said of the popular Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers pairing, ""He gave her class and she gave him sex."" In this film, Blunt provides both the class and the sex, but Segel nevertheless brings enough easygoing charisma and sly wit to the table to make them a believable screen couple. While this is evident in the scenes in which they make doe eyes at each other, it's crucially also identifiable in the sequences in which their characters are at odds with each other. There's a terrific bit in which the two argue in bed, replete with the sort of acidic asides, frustrated exchanges and oddly understandable oxymorons (""I want to be alone ... with you here!"" — a great line) that spring from real life. Scenes like this make the lowbrow moments even more unworthy of inclusion here, whether it's the sight of Violet getting walloped by an opening car door or the increasingly tedious banter between Violet's colleagues at the university. If they had kept all the drama and halved the humor, The Five-Year Engagement would have truly distinguished itself. As it stands, it's engaging but hardly revelatory. The Blu-ray includes both the PG-13 theatrical version and an unrated cut. Extras include audio commentary by Stoller, Segel, Blunt, co-stars Chris Pratt and Alison Brie, and producer Rodney Rothman; a making-of featurette; deleted scenes; extended and alternate scenes; and a gag reel. LA GRANDE ILLUSION (1937). In the latest edition of the decennial Sight & Sound poll, this Jean Renoir classic placed 73rd on the list of the all-time greatest films, even securing top-10 standing on the individual lists submitted by Woody Allen, Mike Newell and a few other participants. Such reverential treatment is nothing new, of course: Back in 1952, both Orson Welles (you know, that Citizen Kane guy) and David Lean (you know, that Lawrence of Arabia helmer) cited the movie as one of their 10 all-time favorite films. Still, not everyone was a fan: Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's rat-faced Minister of Propaganda, declared it ""Cinematic Public Enemy No. 1"" and ordered all available prints destroyed. Further WWII shenanigans resulted in the belief that the original negative was lost, requiring Renoir to use inferior stock for a 1958 release. What no one knew at the time was that the original was safely stored in a Russian vault, and it wasn't until it made its trip back to its native France (where it sat unnoticed for years) that it was finally re-released at its initial length (113 minutes as opposed to the widely distributed 94-minute cut) in 1999. As part of its StudioCanal Collection, Lionsgate has now released it on Blu-ray in a pristine edition sure to delight cinephiles across the country. Set during World War I, the film focuses on three French soldiers — the working-class Lieutenant Marechal (Jean Gabin), the Jewish, middle-class Lieutenant Rosenthal (Dalio) and the aristocratic Captain de Boeldieu (Dita Parlo) — who get captured and spend time in a pair of German prison camps. The second of these prisons is overseen by Captain von Rauffenstein (Erich von Stroheim, commanding in both senses of the word), who feels a special kinship with his upper-class equal, de Boeldieu. So beautifully realized and deeply felt that its title can mean different things to different people (for starters, the grand illusion can be that war solves anything, that the well-bred aristocracy will survive such a brutal conflict, or that the lines that divide classes, races and countries can ever be erased), the movie pushes Renoir's humanist views without having to resort to any manufactured sentiment or cheap theatrics. In short, it's as honest as it is humbling. La Grande Illusion became the first foreign-language film to be nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award. In modern times, it has the distinction of being the very first title released by the prestigious Criterion Collection on DVD (in 1999). Yet it's this beautifully restored Blu-ray edition that will doubtless remain the definitive home edition. Blu-ray extras include a piece in which Renoir expert Olivier Curchod discusses the film's history and controversy; a discussion about the movie with film professor and critic Ginette Vincendeau; a featurette on the remarkable tale behind the discovery of the original negative; a look at the restoration; and the theatrical trailers from 1937 and 1958. THE LORD OF THE RINGS MOTION PICTURE TRILOGY: EXTENDED EDITIONS (2001-2003). Last summer saw the Blu-ray debut of the extended editions of the Lord of the Rings trilogy in one massive box set, so now we get the inevitable release of the movies individually. Of course, given the lengths of the films and the ample amount of extra features accompanying each title, that still translates into a five-disc edition per feature. Between a mountain of critical raves, a $314 million box office haul, and 13 Oscar nominations (resulting in four wins), the colossal success of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) initially caught even ardent admirers of J.R.R. Tolkien's literary trilogy off guard. After having filmed all three parts of the trilogy in one fell swoop (an enormous risk on the part of New Line Cinemas), director Peter Jackson got things off to a roaring start with a fantasy flick that pleased both fans and novices alike. Even those who haven't read the books are doubtless familiar with the saga's basic thrust — noble Middle-earth denizens must destroy a powerful ring before it falls into the hands of an evil warlord — but to their credit, Jackson and his co-scripters kick things off with a helpful prologue that nicely sets up the story. From there, Jackson juggles a daunting array of conflicts and characters (Ian McKellen as the wizard Gandalf is the cast standout), and it's to his credit that the saga leaves viewers panting for more. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) doesn't quite match the majesty of its predecessor, though that's hardly meant as a knock against a rousing, far-reaching spectacle of unlimited ambition. But whereas Fellowship did a nice job of balancing quieter moments with the bombast, this action-packed installment often treats its expository scenes as asides (too many good actors — McKellen, Cate Blanchett, Miranda Otto — are given the short shrift in this outing); what's more, the movie doesn't deepen or expand the tale's themes as masterfully as The Empire Strikes Back added to Star Wars' mystique. But as a stirring story of unsullied heroism, it's a winner, and as an action epic, it features some of the best battle sequences of recent vintage. And while the campaign to win a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for Andy Serkis (voicing the CGI-created Gollum) proved to be a fizzle, he turns out to be the best special effect in a movie crammed with them. This was the Oscar weakling of the bunch, earning two awards out of six nominations, although no one at New Line was complaining about its sizable $341 million gross. Pulling off a successful three-peat, Jackson wraps up Tolkien's fantasy saga with The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), a dazzling chapter that outgrossed its predecessors ($377 million domestically and over one billion internationally) and led to Oscar overkill when the myopic Academy handed it 11-out-of-11 awards (four or five would have been more reasonable), including Best Picture. With the heftiest running time of all three extended editions, this installment is long but not necessarily overlong — even the battle sequences have been executed with more focus and clarity than those in Two Towers. The super-sized length also allows several members of the large cast to strut their stuff, and several new creatures, from an army of ghostly marauders to a gigantic spider in the best Harryhausen tradition, are staggering to behold. Ultimately, though, this final act belongs to the ring-bearer and his equally diminutive companions. The odyssey of the Hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood), his faithful companion Sam (Sean Astin) and the treacherous Gollum contains the true heart of the film, evoking all sorts of emotions as we watch each player constantly forced to make painful decisions and struggle with their own tortured psyches. This is a movie of expensive visual effects and expansive battle scenes, but when it comes to truly making its mark, we have to thank all the little people. The sound and picture quality on the DVDs were so spectacular that (is this blasphemy?) I enjoyed the series even more at home than in the theater — on the big screen, this ambitious undertaking occasionally felt distant, but on disc it exuded more warmth, coming off as the best mini-series never made. On Blu-ray, the sights are even more astounding, and the sound is equally fantastic (better check the living room wall for fissures after cranking this baby). In addition to the extended cuts of all three pictures (running around four hours apiece), each five-disc set also includes hours of bonus material (roughly seven hours on Fellowship, nine on Towers and 10 on King). Notable among the inclusions are the much-ballyhooed, behind-the-scenes documentaries created by Costa Botes, who was given complete set access by Jackson. Other extras include four separate audio commentaries on each film (over 30 participants, including Jackson and most of the principal cast members); 44 featurettes covering practically every aspect of production except for catering (and that might be buried in there somewhere); interactive maps of Middle-earth; and photo galleries containing over 4,000 images."
"Dec 9, 2011",POSITIVE,"The Two Towers, then, is the greatest blockbuster ever made without either a beginning or an end, a feisty beast with a hollow ring in its bones."
"Jun 21, 2011",NEGATIVE," The second chapter of Peter Jackson’s landmark epic, “The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,” differs in narrative and tone from the first one, “”The Fellowship of the Ring.” In this middle segment, the emphasis is more on battles and action set-pieces than on plot or character development.  “The Two Towers,” impressive as it is technically, feels like a middle chapter, mediating between the protags of the first film and the events they would encounter in the third and last one. In their parallel journeys, the Fellowship stands against the powerful forces spreading from the Two Towers, Orthanc Tower in Isengard, where Saruman has bred a lethal army of 10,000 strong; and Sauron’s fortress at Barad-dûr, deep within the dark lands of Mordor. In mood and visuals, “The Two Towers” is darker and more somber than “Fellowship of the Ring,” plunging Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) into an environment of war and waste. Frodo must destroy the malevolent ring of power in the burning area of Mount Doom before it falls into evil hands.  Gollum (voiced by Andy Serkis), who had once possessed the ring, offers to guide them. Meanwhile, the band is split, and fellow hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) are held captive by the awful Uruk-bai, the warrior beasts created by the wicked wizard Saruman (vet Christopher Lee, in a part that fits him like a silk glove). In yet another site, the warrior Aragon (Viggo Mortensen) and his buddies, Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Legolas (handsomer Orlando Bloom), are on their way to the Kingdom of Rohan, which means they have to face the Uruk-hai military. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers culminates in the astonishing battle for the refuge, Helm’s Deep, the Kingdom of Rohan’s ancient large stone fortress, besieged by Uruk-hai warriors. To fully understand “The Two Towers,” it’s crucial to watch the first film as some of that film’s characters reappear briefly, while others are new to the saga, such as princess Eowyn (Mirando Otto), who becomes Aragon’s romantic interest. The Oscar-winning franchise arrived on Blu-ray Disc for the first time on April 6, 2010. It contains the original theatrical versions of the three films with more than 7 hours of special features. The Oscar-winning The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, one of the most spectacular epic adventures in film history, can now be seen as never before when all three of Peter Jackson’s visual masterpieces appear in Blu-ray Disc April 6 as The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy.  The nine-disc set is bund to reawaken the powerful connection that fans have to these films through rich, robust colors and crisp sound that home audiences can only experience on Blu-ray Disc. The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy includes digital copies of each film on three separate discs and will also be BD-Live enabled, offering exciting new interactive possibilities.  The highly anticipated release precedes Warner Interactive Entertainment’s The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn’s Quest videogame launch. The Lord of the Rings, the highest grossing adventure film franchise ever, began with the release of The Fellowship of the Ring, followed by The Two Towers and The Return of the King. The Trilogy’s Blu-ray release captures the enduring Fellowship and ultimate sacrifice while enhancing the chaos and destruction of Middle-earth, delivering a visual feast that will not soon, if ever, find its equal.  Of the 30 total Oscar Award nominations the three The Lord of the Rings movies received, they won a record 17 Oscar Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and 8 others for the third film. Based on the best-selling novels by J.R.R. Tolkien, Jackson’s movie trilogy is an epic journey of men, hobbits, elves, dwarves and the rest of Middle-earth’s creatures and cultures.  The films chronicle the struggle of good versus evil with fantastic special effects and a strong emotional center. The Trilogy debuts at a time when consumers are rapidly adopting Blu-ray Disc.  According to third quarter figures compiled by the Digital Entertainment Group (DEG), in 2009 Blu-ray Disc set-top player sales grew 112 percent over the same period last year and this holiday season consumers can expect to see Blu-ray player prices starting around $100, making it that much easier for home audiences to see the films they love the way they were meant to be seen.  Blu-ray devices are projected to be in 15 million U.S. homes by the end of this year. The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy will also be available day and date on Video on Demand from cable and satellite providers.  The films will be offered for electronic download from online retailers including iTunes, Microsoft Xbox LIVE, Zune marketplace and Amazon Video on Demand. Additionally, Warner Consumer Products has teamed up with top licensees Games Workshop Ltd., Tonner Doll Company, Inc., Sideshow Collectibles, The Noble Collection, WETA, Pez Candy, Funko, LLC, Bioworld Merchandising Inc. and WMS Gaming to create an array of merchandise supporting The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, including apparel and accessories, novelties and collectibles, stationery and paper goods, toys and games. The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn’s Quest, slated for launch in spring 2010, will allow players to become the legendary Aragorn and embark on his greatest adventures through The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  For the first time ever, The Lord of the Rings comes to Wii™, delivering action-packed motion controlled game play that takes full advantage of the Wii Remote and Nunchu. The game features accessible and authentic The Lord of the Rings game play designed for fans of all ages to enjoy together.  The game will also debut for PlayStation2 computer entertainment system, Nintendo DS™ and the PSP (PlayStation Portable) system.   Beyond The Lord of the Rings: Aragon’s Quest, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment (WBIE) will publish multiple games across many genres designed to appeal to a wide range of unique gamers, including hard-core RPG fans as well as families.  Consumers who purchase The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn’s Quest will find a coupon inside for $10 off The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy.  Similarly, consumers who purchase the Trilogy will find a coupon inside for $5 off The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn’s Quest. The Lord of the Rings Trilogy tells the story of Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), a hobbit who battles against the Dark Lord Sauron to save his world, Middle-earth, from the grip of evil. In the films, Frodo and his fellowship of friends and allies embark on a desperate journey to rid Middle-earth of the source of Sauron’s greatest strength, the One Ring — a ring that has the power to enslave the inhabitants of Middle-earth. Beside Wood, the films star Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, John Rhys-Davies, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, featuring Sean Bean, and Ian Holm, with Andy Serkis as Gollum. The films also star Marton Csokas, Craig Parker and Lawrence Makaoare."
"May 7, 2011",POSITIVE,"An army of filmmakers led by the director, Peter Jackson, has made the trilogy's central section a ringing testament to the power of motion pictures."
"Sep 19, 2010",POSITIVE," Like Hobbit protagonist Frodo Baggins wearing the hefty One Ring around his neck on a quest to destroy it, Peter Jackson no doubt struggled with the weight of fanboy expectations. Yet, over the course of three films in 2001, 2002 and 2003 and 10-plus hours — longer on the richer, fuller DVD director’s cuts — Jackson delivered soaring, searing tales of wonderment with electric, genre fence-jumping moves that rank these films among the all-time greats. An unflagging charge from the introductory first frame to the welcome-home last, The Lord of the Rings is powered by burnished, literary masterstrokes of heroism, courage, friendship, betrayal, love, resolve and anger. Where Jackson could have fallen from a precipice, he instead presented a cumulatively career-defining work of greatness. The worlds of men, dwarves, elves and Hobbits (furry short folk) are threatened by the reemergence of the One Ring — sought by the evil lord Sauron who would use it to overrun the land with creatures from the bowels of the world. In The Fellowship of the Ring, a small group is entrusted to journey across Middle-Earth and destroy the ring by tossing it into the fires of Mount Doom — easier said than done. Fellowship bears well the burden of exposition and character introduction, and also introduces two of the series’ numerous action setpieces, both set in the dank Mines of Moria. Battles against a cave troll and the viciously inflammatory Balrog aren’t just visual-effects reels, but trials by fire of the camaraderie among this band of brothers. The Two Towers — tracking the group as it has been severed and scattered — balances a rainy, prolonged battle for Helm’s Deep (a crucial outpost) with Frodo (Elijah Wood) and friend Samwise’s (Sean Astin) struggle for possession of the One Ring with the duplicitous Gollum. Driven to madness by the ring’s powers, what was once known as Smeagol transformed into the amphibious, murderous Gollum. Andy Serkis’s work in creating Gollum — he acted alongside Wood and Astin, with movements fed into a computer to animate the character — deserved an honorary Academy Award. His gestures and voice, not computer software, made Gollum so memorable as he wrestled with his inner homicidal maniac. Avoiding the ineffective conclusion jinx, The Return of the King set so many standards in its overwhelming epic wash that future attempts only seemed like pretenders to the throne. Even Avatar, as visionary as it could be, owed a debt to Jackson’s scope here. Every location, whether real or digitally enhanced, is a jaw-dropping dazzler. Minas Tirith resembles a fort as drawn by M.C. Escher, and its evil counterpart, Minas Morgul, looks like a demented Sydney Opera House lit by Kryptonite. It also allows supporting performers room for affecting arcs — Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan’s Pippin and Merry grow from curious troublemakers to noble warriors who understand the consequences of their choices. Plus, Astin delivers a performance of gale-force emotions, watching his lifelong friend teeter on the edge of madness and death. Its centerpiece — the rousing defense of Minas Tirith — is all it was billed to be, the battle to end all battles. Jackson takes us to the battlefield’s blades of grass with meticulous detail amid all the chaos. You feel the swath cut by charging, woolly mammoth-type beasts and the swift dive-bomb attacks of Sauron’s flying minions. King’s patient conclusion became a pop-culture punchline, but it certainly earns this extended epilogue. After hours spent with so many richly drawn characters — not just Frodo, Samwise, Pippin, Merry and Gollum, but Ian McKellen’s compassionate wizard Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen’s swashbuckling rogue Aragorn and John Rhys-Davies’ Gimli, a fearless dwarf who learns tolerance in wartime — why wouldn’t Jackson strive to give each one a fitting, emotional sendoff? Although New Line, the trilogy’s financing studio, wound up folding after wasting its Rings profit on a passel of expensive projects, Jackson plans to return to Middle-Earth this decade. He’s producing (and now possibly directing) a two-part prequel with The Hobbit, to be released annually a la Rings."
"Mar 23, 2010",POSITIVE,"Gollum and the battles are a triumph of integrated art and technology, and the battles a masterstroke of sheer logistics. (Extended Edition)"
"Apr 29, 2009",POSITIVE," The sequel to the 2001 blockbuster begins where the first one last left off as the hobbits Merry and Pippin have been taken hostage by an army of Orcs, Frodo and Samwise are on the track to Mount Doom to destroy the ring and the three warriors Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimley are tracking the orcs hoping to save the two captured hobbits. Frodo and Samwise are not alone, though. They have captured a fiend that has been tracking them for days; a fiend named Gollum; an ex-hobbit who became a creature from his obsession with the ring. The entire movie is a race against time because Samwise must help destroy the ring before Frodo goes down the same path as Gollum, Merry and Pippin must get to Frodo before he is captured, and the three warriors must get to Rohan before war ensues between the kingdom of Rohan and the Orcs. Once again, surrealistic Peter Jackson instills his unbelievable vision in this as we get to see unbelievable landscapes and beautiful lands. This part of the saga tends to focus more on the three warriors than the actual hobbits. We do get to see Frodo, Samwise in their drastic situation as they must cope with Gollum. Frodo pities him because he hopes he can save the creature as he becomes more obsessed with the ring. We don’t actually see much of Merry and Pippin and they’re not in the movie much, but they’re scenes are very effective as they are rare. The plot with the three warriors is also lengthier as we get to experience more of Legolas’ and Aragorn’s friendship. This movie is full of incredible scenes of sword-fighting, cross bow action and unbelievable war sequences. I have to commend the special-effects team on the creation of Gollum for film, because he is the most realistic looking computer generated character I’ve ever seen. He is a marvel of modern technology as he screeched and crawled his way throughout this film. I was stunned by his look; at times I had to convince myself he was a character because his features are so real, it’ll leave you perplexed and stunned by his facial expressions. This is a masterpiece and excellent follow up to what’s amounting to a superb trilogy."

Chicago (PG-13) 
BUY on Amazon: Poster!

 | Sheet Music!


With the release of the long-aborning film version of Bob Fosse's Roaring '20s-set Broadway hit Chicago, the origins of my Movie Poop Shoot column's title is now out there for the moviegoing world to see, in the late musical number ""Razzle Dazzle"": ""Give 'em the old flim flam flummox/Fool and fracture 'em.""  It seemed like a good idea at the time; after all, it was a variation of a phrase that was proven to be catchy, and it was sung by a super-slimy yet super-smooth and super-cool character, attorney Billy Flynn.  I guess it would only figure that in this film version he would be played by someone characterized by the first, but not the second or third, term--Richard Gere.
Another line from ""Razzle Dazzle"" comes to mind when watching--or, more specifically, listening--to Gere's performance: ""Long as you keep 'em way off balance/How can they spot you got no talents?""  That's the only reason I can rationalize the effusive praise, including a Golden Globe nomination, for his performance here.  Certainly he's passable when simply speaking (after all, exuding smarm is Gere's strongest suit), and he does surprisingly decently with a big tap dance number.  But singing?  I'm not sure if his nasal, bad-Al-Jolson-impression vocalizing can qualify as such, and in so doing he murders the character.  Billy's sleaze, to be sure, but he's also a seducer, and a convincing one at that--a quality that generally comes through in his singing.  With Gere every bit as off-putting in that area, Billy's bag o' bamboozling tricks seem that much more ridiculous.
What makes Gere's off-key performance all the more frustrating is that first-time feature director Rob Marshall gets so much so right otherwise; in translation to stage to screen, Chicago has retained all of its deliciously mean spirit without a hint of Hollywood dilution.  It certainly helps that Marshall's casting of the two central characters, publicity-hungry rival murderesses Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly, is spot-on.  That Catherine Zeta-Jones does a bang-up job with the latter role isn't necessarily a surprise, considering she started her career hoofing and belting on the London stage.  What does come as a shock is how the already-famously-ravishing starlet here  achieves an even more stunning level of sensuality; sultrily singing and sashaying across the screen in the opening number ""All That Jazz,"" Zeta-Jones gets the film off to a sexy, high-energy start, and the film flat-out electrifies whenever she's on screen.  Zellweger, whose previous musical inexperience made her an especially unlikely casting choice (though not as unlikely as Gere), proves unexpectedly able to carry the torch with the film's second number, ""Funny Honey,"" exposing a sneaky, dark edge and coquettish sexuality that usually stays buried under a girl next door persona.  When the stage is all hers--literally--in her midway showcase number ""Roxie,"" she carries it like an old pro, turning a bare black set into a dazzling place.
Or should I say ""a razzle-dazzling place.""  Chicago is, after all, all about the showmanship of its music and performers, with the cynical plot about upstart Roxie and veteran Velma fighting for the spotlight, stardom, and for freedom with the help of oil-slick Billy most definitely a secondary concern.  Marshall stages the narrative scenes in a fairly pedestrian manner and pulls out all the glitzy stops for the musical ones, reflecting the new-for-the-movies device devised by screenwriter Bill Condon: all of the numbers are fantasies sprung from Roxie's vaudeville-obsessed mind, à la Björk in Dancer in the Dark.  (The ""Cell Block Tango"" number, which builds from the noise of a leaky faucet, especially brings that other film to mind.)  For the most part, the conceit works, though at times it's a stretch, as in ""Mr. Cellophane,"" the big song for Roxie's decent-to-a-fault husband, Amos (John C. Reilly, displaying a solid set of pipes).  Marshall and editor Martin Walsh's giddy, flashy, MTV-style cutting sometimes works against the film, particularly Marshall's own choreography (ironic, considering Chicago the stage show is primarily known for its dancing), but the energy of the performances and John Kander and Fred Ebb's enduring score push these sequences and the entire film over any hurdle--yes, even including the misbegotten casting of Gere.

Marshall and editor Martin Walsh's giddy, flashy, MTV-style cutting sometimes works against the film, particularly Marshall's own choreography (ironic, considering Chicago the stage show is primarily known for its dancing), but the energy of the performances and John Kander and Fred Ebb's enduring score push these sequences and the entire film over any hurdle--yes, even including the misbegotten casting of Gere. 
The first half of the film (which is the first Indian production to be shot entirely in Los Angeles) more closely resembles the Bryan Singer film than the Quentin Tarantino, with six ""usual suspect"" crooks (Amitabh Bachchan, Sanjay Dutt, Sunil Shetty, Mahesh Manjrekar, Kumar Gaurav and Lucky Ali) meeting up in jail after being picked up on suspicion of stealing a truck. While in a holding cell, the six devise a plan to strike back against the cops: robbing a bank that services the police force. The first act climaxes with the heist, and following the intermission the film traces the aftermath, which largely takes place in--yes--an abandoned warehouse.
A good thirty-minute chunk of this second half will be déjà vu for Dogs fans, as the characters true colors--if you get my drift--coming clear; the entrance of the mostly Mr. Blonde-ish character is lifted wholesale, as are some of his lines of dialogue. But Gupta ultimately uses this as a mere launchpad for his own spin on the familiar story. There is more extensive backstory for all of the characters (undoubtedly a product in part of the longer run time), not to mention this is more of a straight action film than either of the original films. In the big blow-'em-up set pieces, Gupta reveals a number of other influences aside from Singer, Christopher McQuarrie (after whom a cop character is named) and Tarantino, namely John Woo, Michael Bay and the general Jerry Bruckheimer aesthetic. Evoking the latter two may not necessarily be a good thing in general, but the slick Tinseltown-level sheen works in this context and is especially noteworthy given the slapdash nature of a lot of Bollywood productions.
In fact, the Western sensibility was perhaps too strongly in mind in the making of Kaante. The producers' plan is shop an edited version for a wider North American arthouse release, and as such the musical numbers have obviously been designed for easy removal--that is, what few musical numbers there are; there are only three total, two of which are largely focused on female back-up dancers rather than prominent characters. But the MTV-esque numbers do not upset the overall tone of the film, and they indeed get the entertaining job done (after all, how can one not resist a drunken song-and-dance by the guys in that familiar warehouse the night before the heist?) as well as show that if Gupta ever wants to cross over into Hollywood, he is equally suited to the realm of music video as he is to slam-bang action.
In the meantime, though, Gupta proves to be right at home in Bollywood with Kaante, which (with the unfortunate exception of one literally last-minute bit of hilariously godawful acting by an actress in a tiny but pivotal role as a mentally-challenged character) is as seamless and effective a mix of Bombay and Hollywood genre conventions as they come.

Leonardo DiCaprio does a decent enough job in Gangs of New York, but he is clearly more in his element in Steven Spielberg's more modern caper, based on the memoirs of one Frank Abagnale, Jr. (DiCaprio), a master con who sent the Feds on a years-long chase across the country and the globe in the 1960s--all while he was still a teenager.   As a cat-and-mouse thriller, this amiably light-footed chase gets the job done, buoyed by Spielberg's urgent yet confidently loose-limbed pacing, John Williams's toe-tapping jazz score and the performances of the well-cast DiCaprio, Christopher Walken (nicely, uncharacteristically reined-in as Frank Sr.) and Tom Hanks (obviously having a lot of fun as the lead Fed).  Unfortunately Spielberg and screenwriter Jeff Nathanson were not content to leave the film as an expertly calibrated popcorn entertainment, as they feel the need to serve up a trite ""emotional"" reasoning behind Frank Jr.'s behavior (it's a rebellious reaction to his parents' divorce--boo hoo) that instead makes the film less substantial rather than more.  However, the misfired dramatic pretensions do nothing to negate the suspense, laughs and thrills that are served up by Spielberg and company.
 
If only, aside from Philip Glass's atmospheric score, the entire film registered as something more than ""performance.""  It's easy to appreciate the acting involved, from the three lead performances down to Toni Collette's highly memorable single-scene cameo (Harris, in full-tilt hammy Oscar-grabbing Pollock mode as Streep's AIDS-stricken ex-lover, is one notable exception, however), but the performers' efforts are the only reason to care much for these characters, which are rather thinly developed in David Hare's screenplay.  Through Moore we get a vivid sense of housewife Laura Brown's desperation, but the character remains a cipher beyond her need to escape and interest in the book Mrs. Dalloway.  On the flip side, there never is enough of that sense of desperation in Streep's storyline to make any suspense over Clarissa's possible self-destruction convincing.  The Woolf thread is the best realized, but that has more to do with Kidman's performance, which fully fleshes out Hare's vague ""mad genius stifled by sedate country living"" conceit.  None of these flaws, however, is likely to matter with Academy voters, as The Hours looks and sounds too much like a prototypical Best Picture contender to resist. 
Gangs has been a dream project for Scorsese for decades, and the effort and time spent on research shows through in each speck of dirt on Sandy Powell's period-perfect costumes and every loose shingle on every dilapidated building in production designer Dante Ferretti's uncanny recreation of 1863 New York City, specifically the neighborhood known as the Five Points.  There, a clandestine revenge scheme is being played out by young Irish-American Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio), who vows vengeance against vicious gang leader Bill ""the Butcher"" Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) for killing his father (Liam Neeson) in a vicious Nativist-vs.-Irish battle many years earlier.  And that, right there, is why Gangs disappoints; the revenge story, as well as a romance between Amsterdam and a pickpocketing prostitute (Cameron Diaz), aren't nearly as captivating as the history onto which it's grafted.   Scorsese himself seems less interested in screenwriters Jay Cocks, Steven Zaillian and Kenneth Lonergan's plot concerns than the real-life events; the power of the film's climax derives largely from his stunning recreation of the 1863 Civil War Draft Riots than the resolution of the Amsterdam-Bill conflict, and the needless voiceover narration provided by DiCaprio (reportedly an addition that came late in the long post-production--and does that ever show) revels largely in extraneous historical details.
To borrow the old cliché, the whole may not add up to the sum of its parts, but in the case of Gangs it's difficult to dismiss the brilliance of those parts--particularly Day-Lewis.  His Bill the Butcher is over-the-top without being cartoony, deliciously diabolical yet painfully human.  Day-Lewis's performance goes a long way in filling in the blanks of the somewhat underwritten idea that an incognito Amsterdam, in being taken under the wing of an unaware Bill, finds his lost father figure in his sworn enemy.  Scorsese's direction is effective beyond his attention to detail; the opening battle sequence, aside from some ill-fitting scoring, and the climax provide a visceral charge; and some quieter moments, particularly a much-talked-about bedside chat between Bill and Amsterdam, are equally memorable.  While Scorsese now denies any studio tampering with his vision for the theatrical release, one can only hope that time and special edition DVD will later reveal the masterpiece that this acceptable but disappointing version of Gangs occasionally hints at becoming.

Ironically, the film loses its way when Schmidt arrives at his destination of Denver, where his fed-up daughter (Hope Davis) is getting married to what Schmidt sees as an unsuitable match: a balding, ponytailed waterbed salesman (Dermot Mulroney).  Here, the film falls into the broad gags that had heretofore been avoided: Schmidt gets a stiff neck; Schmidt gets hyped up on painkillers, etc.  Kathy Bates has justly won praise for her funny, ballsy performance as Mulroney's uninhibited mother, but her character is more in line with the more obvious humor that rules over this section of the film.  That said, it is Nicholson, his fascinating character, and Payne's empathy toward him that ultimately rules over the entire film; a simple, silent, static shot of his face is one of the most beautiful, powerful, indelible images of the 2002 movie year. 
Adaptation. (the period is part of the title) is at once more unusual and more conventional than Kaufman and Jonze's previous mindbender of a collaboration, the literal head trip that was Being John Malkovich.  That this film focuses not on inexplicable portals into actors' brains but the down-to-earth difficulty of the writing task makes it a more accessible one by default; that said, this film is even more of an insular look into someone's head, with Kaufman going so far as to invent a polar opposite twin brother to illustrate his struggles on the screen.  While the self-loathing artiste Charlie (Nicolas Cage) struggles to capture the essence of Orlean's poetic but decidedly uncinematic prose about orchid enthusiast John Laroche, brother Donald (also played by Cage) is having a far easier time with his own creative (in name only) writing endeavors, slavishly adhering to the structure guidelines set forth by screenwriting guru Robert McKee (played onscreen by Brian Cox) to come up with a thoroughly formulaic Tinseltown-ready thriller.
From this description, the film sounds like it's way too inside, but the inherently indulgent nature of the story is offset by Kaufman's smart, self-lascerating sense of humor and Jonze's inventive direction, not to mention the efforts of the cast.  Cage pulls off the dual role without a hitch, and while Chris Cooper has been winning the most critical accolades and awards out of the cast as Laroche, doing just as well in a perhaps more difficult role is Meryl Streep, who plays Orlean.  She (and, for that matter, Cooper) is mostly seen in vignettes taken from the book (yes, there is indeed some adaptation going on here), but the film's twists afford Streep an opportunity to display her dramatic and equally formidable comedic chops all at once.
The directions taken by those twists make Adaptation. even more divisive than it already is to begin with; it's all too easy to say that Kaufman and Jonze lose their way, and everything falls to pieces in the end.  Far from it, I say.  The pair know exactly where they are going, and the sheer bravado alone makes the film more alive and exciting than most films that have seen release this year.  That they pull off the joke with such savvy hilarity (and, wisely, without so much as an obvious wink-wink, nudge-nudge to the audience) is just gravy.

"Apr 29, 2008",POSITIVE,Glorious escapism that will not make you feel dirty the morning after.
"Mar 5, 2008",POSITIVE,More graphic in its violence and more fantastic in its imaginings than the first film.
"Dec 7, 2007",POSITIVE," Less direct and coherent than its predecessor, but wider in scope, Jackson/Tolkein's difficult second movie just about manages to get away with it all, and there are times when it provides a rollicking good adventure. I would recommend that the parents of young children go to see it themselves before escorting their offspring, as it is extremely violent and gruesome in places, echoing the director's earlier work, and there are moments which are genuinely scary (a rare thing in fantasy cinema). The darker story is somehow more satisfying, however, as we're now dealing with characters who begin to understand what they're about, instead of being frustratingly, albeit charmingly, delusional; so we can tackle the issues of war and conquest head on. Here are the battles only hinted at in the first film. Here is action where before there was only angst. Here is Peter Jackson in his element, vigorous and inventive, grabbing one's attention and holding onto it through long, complex scenes of conflict. There are brilliantly visualised war machines, intriguing tactical manouvers, blood and gore, Flynn-style fighting from the ballet-trained Orlando Bloom (as Legolas), and properly disgusting, bloodthirsty uruk-hai. Despite all this, much of the tweeness of the first story still lingers, most notably in the tale of Merry and Pippin, whose forest adventures do drag, slowing everything down, though this may satisfy those who insist that the greatest virtue such a movie might have is faithfulness to its source. Clever photography provides cinematic references to the work of HG Wells, both in the recurring comparison of the uruk-hai to morlocks (who are not treated altogether without sympathy), and in the demonstration of evil industry destroyed by natural forces. This latter part is a bit heavy-handed, a legacy of a cruder political age, when the First World War on which so much of Tolkein's fable is based helped to give birth to the New Age movement, but Jackson deftly steers away from the absolute condemnation of technological progress which has become a staple of modern fantasy. The real frustration at this point is simply that Christopher Lee (as Saurman) really doesn't get enough to do. The stand-out performances in this film come (once again) from Elijah Wood as the increasingly troubled Frodo, and from the computer-animated Gollum, whose pathetic split-personality soliloquies manage to be at once ridiculous, pitiful, and sinister. The interplay of these two characters presents an unusually astute study of the mechanics of addiction, and has the sort of real-world relevance which all really good fantasy strives to accomplish. Although Frodo and Gollum (and Sam, travelling with them) don't actually do very much, they remain fascinating to watch. Perhaps the greatest weakness of this story is that, aside from those final battles, nobody really does very much, at least not in comparison to the amount of soul-searching, strategic meandering and general arsing about. It's hard to care about a king as useless as Theoden, despite effective borrowings from Lear. Wormtongue comes across as altogether too crude and obvious to be disturbing. Eowyn's fight to be allowed to fight as she is able is affecting, but sidelined; and Aragorn's angst about his love for Arwen (with Liv Tyler still more wooden than the ents) gets tediously drippy, despite some beautiful gothic photography. The New Zealand landscape is still stunning, but less exciting this time. Sauron somehow doesn't seem as mighty as he should. If I go to see this film a second time, I shall take a (different) book, because there are passages within it which really are dull; but there are also parts which I rather think I might enjoy watching hundreds of times. The bittiness of the whole can be forgiven on account of their brilliance. The wargs are well realised and really scary, it's exciting to see Gandalf reveal how capable he really is, and the growing rapport between Gimli and Legolas makes it easier to care about these disparate characters. The set piece involving the flood is one of the most impressive uses of special effects I've ever seen, a really hard thing to get right, and it sweeps one away. The nazghul remain intensely creepy. Frodo's fall is heartbreaking. And, of course, Gollum gets the last word. This film is not altogether satisfying, but you'd be an idiot to miss it."
"Aug 13, 2007",POSITIVE," Even though I was lost through some of it, I liked The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers better than its predecessor, The Fellowship of the Ring. As the middle section of what is really one long story (or one long nine-hour movie), it doesn’t bother setting anything up — it assumes you’ve seen the first one — and just plunges in. Whereas Fellowship gave us the sunlit complacency of the Shire darkening into grim duty, Two Towers begins on a note of near-disaster — a dream of the standoff between the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the fearsome Balrog — and mostly keeps its jaws clenched in readiness for hopeless battle. The theme of this Act Two is good warriors standing tall in the face of odds that could hardly suck worse. If that sounds like a downer, it isn’t; Peter Jackson, delivering the second of his three Christmas gifts to J.R.R. Tolkien fans worldwide, comes most alive during the scenes of peril and evil, of which there are enough here for a year’s worth of movies. One could conceivably enjoy The Two Towers knowing very little of its conflicts or interspecies politics; it can be processed as pure cinema, and forget about the plotlines, which in any event are unavoidably way stations to The Return of the King. We do spend a great deal of the movie watching characters prepare for things that won’t happen in the movie; even the big-bang sequence, the battle at Helm’s Deep, is but a minor skirmish in the grand scheme of things. A good deal of the dawdling is fun. The fearful comic-relief hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) find themselves hanging on a massive walking and talking tree — an Ent, really, a sort of plant elemental that watches over the green. These Ents talk slowly and arrive at decisions even more slowly; Jackson seems to be tweaking the ponderousness of most epics. Meanwhile, the human warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) tries to get the woefully unprepared kingdom of Rohan ready for legions of merciless Uruk-hai sent by the evil wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee); and Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), bearer of Tolkien’s mystical McGuffin the One Ring, and his loyal friend Samwise (Sean Astin) slouch towards Mordor to dispose of the thing, accompanied by the wretched Gollum. Most of the hype surrounding Two Towers has centered on Helm’s Deep and Gollum. Of the two — and the battle is one of the best of its kind in film history, a symphony of bloodlust and hopes dashed and restored — I prefer the little creature who used to be called Smeagol before the Ring stole his mind and soul. As you’ve heard, Gollum is played in voice and gesture by Andy Serkis, and fleshed out digitally by Jackson’s computer wizards. You’ll always be aware that Gollum isn’t literally “real,” but in his pathetically addled way he’s more real than anyone else in the movie. Jackson seems to have studied Jar Jar Binks and learned from George Lucas’s mistake. Two Towers may play narratively as a downer, but Jackson is too spirited a director to get bogged down: Characters are always reminding each other to keep hope alive in the midst of dread and panic. Hope is there, too, in the raw beauty Jackson finds everywhere, whether in battle or in a poetically downbeat episode at Rivendell with a weeping Arwen (Liv Tyler). Jackson hasn’t disdained his horror-movie roots, either: no director could be happier among the Orcs and Uruk-hai, and he has the diabolical wit to end this second entry on a note of demented enthusiasm that functions as a chilling cliffhanger. Fellowship interested and entertained me; this one hooked me."

"Sep 30, 2005",POSITIVE," 
	And the Masterpiece continues.  With The Two Towers, director Peter Jackson takes us one step further along the journey of the quest to destroy the one ring of power.  As in The Fellowship of the Ring, the world of Middle Earth is faithfully re-created and we are re-immersed in the world that J.R.R. Tolkien created in his literary classic. 
	Jumping immediately into the action from where we left off in the first installment, The Two Towers hits the ground running and the action just never stops.  Having already established the situation and introduced the characters in The Fellowship of the Ring allows the plot to move along at a nice clip. 
	More than the first movie, The Two Towers differs from the book it is based upon.  The most important difference being that the movie ends one chapter short of the last chapter of the book.  This was the most shocking change because the book ends on a cliffhanger, where the movie, ending where it does, really isn't one.  Instead, it ends more at a moment where all of the characters are taking a breather, a pause in the action so to speak. 
	Another change, and this one is a good one, is that where as the book is clearly divided into two books, one covering Sam, Frodo, and Gollum, and the other covering the adventures of the rest of the Fellowship, with no cutting back and forth between the two, in the movie; the action is constantly cutting back and forth between the two.  This definitely helps the tension and the sense that all this is happening at the same time. 
	The best new part of this movie is the character of Gollum, who was only in the first one for a few moments.  If they were to give an Oscar for the best CGI character, he would win it hands down.  His schizophrenic conversations with himself are funny and touching at the same time.  He is the first computer animated character in a movie I actually felt was fully rounded and actually evoked emotions in me. 
	Another stunning moment in a movie filled with stunning moments, is the battle of Helms Deep.  It is to Fantasy battles what Saving Private Ryan's opening scene was to war movies.  The attack of the Orcs, who swarm like ants against the castle defended by our heroes is non-stop action and visually brilliant. 
	Frankly, this is one of those movies where a review is completely unnecessary.  If you saw The Fellowship of the Ring and enjoyed it (and how could you not?), then you'll enjoy this movie.  To put that another way, if you have any taste at all, then you'll enjoy this movie.  To put it one more way, these three movies will stand the test of time, they are already classics.  There is no reason for you not to see this movie.  It has action, adventure, romance, great characters, great villains, fabulous sets, special effects, and anything else you could possible want!  Go see this movie!!!! 
	As Scott said the second part of The Lord of the Rings trilogy continues the magic of the first. The story grows more epic in scale and the cast of characters continues to increase. The kingdoms of Gondor and Rohan are introduced, as are the ents, led by the wistful Treebeard. Like in the first movie director Peter Jackson balances beautifully between faithfulness to the written word and small concessions to the celluloid reality of movie making. 
	Through the wonderful performance by Elijah Wood, we see the ring's effect on Frodo growing stronger. It is an addiction that has consumed Gollum and now threatens the brave hobbit. This arouses in Frodo sympathy for the tortured soul once called Smeagol. They are like two junkies in rehab; the One Ring of Power gives them a common bond that must be experienced to be understood. 
	My favorite characters in the books were always Gimli and Legolas. I love their contest to see who can kill the most orcs during the battle of Helms Deep. 
	The brilliance of the story is in the minute details that are painted on such a vast and ambitious canvas. At times we are standing back seeing the whole landscape with tiny figures running across the horizon and then seconds later we are privy to an intimate moment between characters we know like old friends. 
	I can't wait to watch all three of them together. They really are one long movie just as the books are really one long novel. I think Tolkien would approve. 
	Scott wrote that the movie ""hits the ground running."" Not exactly. Yes, most of the main characters are here so we do not need them introduced. What Scott did not mention is that many new characters get introduced. So there are many dialogue scenes. This movie really has no more or no less action than the first. 
	This film does have one hell of a climactic battle. It is however, the last half hour of a three hour movie. This battle alone is worth the price of the ticket. Actually my ticket was free. I got it out of my dvd case of The Fellowship Of The Ring. Anyway, the battle is suspenseful and thrilling. 
	Aragorn, Legalos and Gimli are the real focal point of this movie. Where as in the first movie the humor came from Merry and Pippin, in this one it is from Gimli. When he can't see over the rampart or when he asks Aragorn not to tell the elf that he had to toss him. The relationship between these three characters is what made the movie for me. 
	The weak part of this movie is the same as what I felt for the book. The Two Towers seems like so much filler. How many times do Sam and Frodo stand on a hill and look at Mordor? Do they ever get any closer? At one point Gollum has them right at the gates of Mordor. A few scenes later they appear to be further away again. remember in the first movie when Gandalf first looks out over the country and sees the fires of Mordor. Why couldn't Gandalf just lend Frodo his horse. Apparently he can get around a hell of a lot faster than these 2 hobbits. 
	The only plot development this movie has with Frodo is that we see him slowly succumbing to the weight of the ring. One of the scariest things in the first movie is the Nazgul. They are back and they now ride on black dragons. However, they are completely underused and thus not at all threatening. Luckily we have the much more entertaining story of Strider, Gimli and Legalos to carry this movie."
"Jul 5, 2005",POSITIVE," In the second installment of Peter Jackson's epic adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings,"" the franchise exceeds the majestic heights achieved a year ago by the first film of the series. Maintaining the commitment to cinematic beauty, story and amazing special effects he established with
  ""The Fellowship of the
    Ring,"" Jackson once again gives stunning life to one of the finest stories ever written with ""The Two Towers."" 
The film is divided into three subplots: Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) continue their hunt of the nasty Uru-kai tribes in their search to rescue Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) from the Orcs who kidnapped them in the closing moments of ""Fellowship""; Merry and Pippin meet a new friend in their quest to regroup with their comrades; and Sam (Sean Astin) stands by Frodo's (Elijah Wood) side in their burdensome journey to Mordor, where they meet the treacherous yet helpful Gollum along the way. All of this happens in the midst of a brewing battle between Men and Orcs at the Rohan stronghold, Helm's Deep, by far one of the most engaging and exciting battle sequences ever filmed.  
While comparing the two movies is unfair because they each were produced with different goals in mind, ""Two Towers"" soars above ""Fellowship"" as the better film, probably due to the grander scale upon which it was made. The CGI character Gollum looks quite stunning as well, at times resembling a human actor so closely that you'll forget he's a computer creation.  
Peter Jackson upholds his credentials as a director, staying true to Tolkien's original work full of great battles, complicated love stories and the strengthening ties of friendship, while still incorporating the uniqueness he brings as a member of ""The Lord of the Rings"" team. This second film is just as long as the first, though, and it doesn't quite finish the second book, which leaves a lot of leftover work for the third and final film of this series. In other words, the wait for ""The Return of the King"" will drag on even more painfully than the past year did. 
DVD Review: 
For anyone who thought that the four-disc extended editions  of the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy was the be-all and end-all of DVD releases,  you’re sadly mistaken. The limited edition releases of the film deliver the definitive “LOTR” experience. Sure, they  don’t have two extra discs worth of bonus material, but who needs to sort  through all of that junk when the included documentary features everything you  could ever want? Produced by critically acclaimed documentary filmmaker Costa  Boates, the three never-before-seen documentaries total just over five hours  and includes coverage on everything from production, post-production, and even  a few on-set antics with the cast/crew. Also featured on the two-disc set for  the first time ever are both the theatrical and extended versions of the film  (via seamless branching), which makes this a no-brainer purchase for those who  currently own the original theatrical releases on DVD.

"Mar 3, 2005",NEGATIVE,"I began to wonder, as the waves crashed about: Is it still possible for a movie to get excited about people?"
"Jan 15, 2005",NEGATIVE," Busing to work one morning last January, I counted four commuters with their noses buried in copies of a book first published in 1954. J. R. R. Tolkien's perpetually popular epic The Lord of the Rings is more beloved than ever, thanks to director Peter Jackson's shock-inducing 2001 film The Fellowship of the Ring. Exhilarated by Fellowship's cliffhanger ending, newcomers and old fans alike rushed to the books for resolution. As they line up for The Two Towers, some people may have an inkling that there is more to this mayhem than meets the eye. Tolkien the Mythmaker knew that stories rooted in truth will endure. In Middle Earth, a world stripped down to essentials — earth, fire, water, wood, metal, flesh, spirit — we see our own dying world mirrored and clarified. Further, we see reflections of God's grace, Christ's sacrifice, and the hope of resurrection. Such elemental plotting speaks to our longings, evoking both sorrow and joy. Towers opens with a cliffhanger (literally), and when a hero falls, an adrenaline rush begins that never lets up. ""It's getting heavier,"" Frodo says of the ring. As the temperature rises, fires of spiritual conflict that ignited in Fellowship eventually explode into war. Hobbits Merry and Pippin, abducted by orcs, are pursued by three companions: Gimli the untossable dwarf, Legolas the elf, and Aragorn, reluctant heir to the kingdom of men. But these would-be rescuers are soon diverted to a different task: King Theoden needs help in saving his people before Saruman's orcs lay waste to his kingdom. Their victory depends upon Frodo the ring-bearer who, with Samwise at his side, wearily trudges across blasted Mordor miles. The ring draws villains from all directions. Gollum creeps up behind, winged devils patrol the skies, and Sauron's watchful Eye never blinks. Dire straits indeed. If this were a video game, you'd just hit Start Over. Filling Out Gollum
But for all its digital wizardry, this is no game. Towers falls just short of Fellowship as the finest film of its genre. The scenery alone justifies the high price of your ticket. Designers Alan Lee and John Howe continue to dazzle us with convincing creatures, castles, and environments. Battle scenes unsurpassed in scale and intensity inspire awe. The performances—most notably those of Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen — are as intense as in the first film. Actor Andy Serkis collaborates with animators, bringing vivid life to the vicious, hissing Gollum. The film occasionally stumbles. Towers clearly posed a formidable challenge to its screenwriters. Fellowship followed a motley crew through trial and tribulation; Towers tracks three sets of characters—four, if you count Saruman's behind-the-scenes meddling. Some stories gallop, others only amble. Thus, Towers feels rushed and fragmented, channel-surfing from plot to plot. Jackson complicates matters. In Fellowship, he wisely pruned branches of plot to emphasize the ring-bearer's quest, shoehorning enough story for a six-hour film into three. This time he replaces important episodes with unnecessary tangents. We lose our intimacy with major characters: Gandalf is too busy to chat, Merry and Pippin get stranded too long on Treebeard's shoulders, and Gimli is reduced to punchlines (fortunately, he's hilarious). Treebeard's folk seem lazy and naïve, a far cry from Tolkien's magisterial Ents. New villains fail to frighten as the Cave Troll, Balrog, and Black Riders did in Fellowship. (Still, concerned parents should be wary: Towers is more violent and monster-filled than Fellowship.) And purists will grumblingly inquire why Jackson stopped short of such climactic scenes as Gandalf's visit to Isengard and Frodo in Shelob's Lair. Enough quibbling. These flaws fail to blunt the impact of the story's resonant moral insights. Tolkien made every character's heart a battlefield between desire and selflessness, and Jackson underlines and boldfaces this theme. Call it Soul Wars, Episode Two. Villains give in to greed; heroes persevere through Christlike suffering. Gandalf returns from death's edge, a risen savior. His healing of the poisoned King Theoden, which Jackson gleefully exaggerates, stands as one of the great movie exorcisms. Arwen surrenders her immortality in the name of love. Aragorn wrestles personal demons, preparing to be a messianic king. Samwise, patient and forgiving, helps Frodo carry his cross. The fiercest struggle takes place in the tortured soul of Gollum. Smeagol — Gollum's original, hobbit-like self — struggles feebly to overcome his ravenous, lustful alter ego like a timid child trying to slay a dragon. It is the filmmakers' most commendable triumph that he gains our sympathies. We come to hope that, by Frodo's stripes, this poor creature can be healed. In a season when critical favorites (Adaptation, 8 Mile, Gangs of New York) tell fractured tales of heroes with broken moral compasses, it is encouraging to watch Tolkien's triumphs, tragedies, and consolations coalesce in the most compelling adventure film of 2002. If Jackson shows the same focus in The Return of the King (to be released in 2003), it could be the most meaningful of them all. Our sister publication Books & Culture asked in its January/February 2002 issue if Tolkien should be acknowledged as the foremost author of the twentieth century."

"Jun 19, 2003",POSITIVE," Is it too early to say
The Lord of the Rings is the best cinematic fantasy trilogy of all time,
even with the series’ third installment The Return of the King still a
year a way? Based on this second chapter, The Two Towers, it most
certainly is not. I cannot imagine, with all three films shot at once, that the
climax to this story will be any less of a stunning success than both this film
and The Fellowship of the Ring proved to be. Part two literally
hits the ground running. There is no exposition, no quick recap of last year’s
Oscar-winning epic, and this sequel is all the better because of this. Even so The
Two Towers is fabulously entertaining, if only for its massive scope and suitably
epic vision alone. This gigantic undertaking is never anything less than
stunning for practically every second of its almost three-hour running time, surpassing
the considerably large expectations of an over-eager audience at nearly every opportunity. The fellowship has
been fractured beyond repair. The ringbearer Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood)
and his loyal friend Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) are making their way into
the treacherous lands of Mordor alone, Meanwhile, their hobbit companions Merry
(Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) are being held captive
by a murderous band of Uruk-hai making their way to the traitorous wizard
Saruman (Christopher Lee). But they will not be left to die. Human
Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and dwarf
Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are fast on the horde’s trail, and no matter
what it takes they will save their two hobbit friends. This chase comes to a
sudden end with the arrival of an old friend. Thought dead in the caverns of
Moria fighting the vicious Balrog, the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) is
brought back to join the fight. Joining the three warriors, he lets them know
Merry and Pippin have been safely let out of danger and into the arms of the ancient
tree creatures known as the Ents, instructing Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli to stop
worrying about the two hobbits and that they must change direction and make for
the kingdom of Rohan immediately. As for Frodo and Sam,
enter into a dangerous alliance with the devilish Gollum (Andy Serkis).
Hoping to find some shred of his former self still intact, the ringbearer
spares the wicked creature’s life in return for leading them into the heart of
Mordor. At first Frodo’s trust seems to pay dividends as the ravaged soul of
the beast, brutalized to virtual erasure under the influence of the One Ring
for so many decades, begins to awake from its exceedingly long slumber, the
former hobbit making a valiant attempt to beat down the psychotic influences of
Gollum and let his former self known as Sméagol regain control. But the influence
of the One Ring is not so easily overcome, and Sam isn’t so certain their new
guide isn’t just biding his time as he plots both his and Frodo’s demise. That is a lot of balls
in the air to try and juggle successfully, and with handfuls of new characters
added to the mix director Peter Jackson and his team of craftsman unsurprisingly
have their work cut out for them. Yet it is all handled splendidly. Introduction
of the new characters is handled quickly and with eloquence. What more, even
with the sequel’s breakneck pace each person is given room to develop into a fully-formed
multidimensional human being. The best of these new
human faces are Éowyn (Miranda Otto) and Théoden, King of Rohan (Bernard
Hill). Otto is magnificent, her gorgeous face glistening with determination
and purpose even in the face of the gravest danger. But she’s no girly-girl,
and her growing infatuation with future king Aragorn is quietly subtle. Hill is
even better. As for Théoden, he’s broken shell of a man first introduced, poisoned
by the venom-filled words of his adviser Gríma Wormtongue (a slithery Brad
Dourif). But with all his character loves and holds dear under threat of
annihilation, Hill blossoms from lost soul to worried king to forceful leader
throughout his story arc, adding a level of haunted gravitas to the story that’s
superb. The seductive
influence of greed, power and pure evil are ever-present, most notably in the
film’s most ingenious creation Gollum. Here is the first completely CGI
character that isn’t just a technical showpiece, and credit for that must fall
as much on actor Serkis’ shoulders as it should the production’s technical
crew. It is a delicious performance overflowing in internalized conflict and irrational
obsession, all of it raging inside the body of a pitiful lost soul. While I can’t
say these visual effects are seamless, Gollum is far from photorealistic, that
does not make them any less impressive. This is a groundbreaking performance
that will change the cinematic game forever, the creature’s movements and
mannerisms birthed from the mind of the actor creating them and then dazzlingly
augmented by Jackson’s crackerjack effects team. At its center, The
Two Towers delivers one of the most spectacular battle sequences I have
personally ever seen. The Battle of Helm’s Deep is like Henry V at Agincourt
but with the odds multiplied by at least a factor of ten. Jackson unleashes a flurry
of flying arrows, swinging swords and huge explosions. Taking up a full hour of
screen time, this is a titanic struggle between good and evil where the outcome
always feels, even for those who have read Tolkien’s book, somewhat in doubt.
It’s breathlessly incredible stuff, the final showdown an eye-popping, emotion-fueled
triumph that had me wanting to rise to my feet and cheer. Yet as magnificent as all of that might be Jackson never loses sight of the bigger picture. The director astutely hints at what is still to come, knowing full well that the major dramatic twist and turns will culminate in force during the trilogy’s final chapter. But he still allows for this film to stand entirely on its own even though it is the middle chapter of the story. This is a landmark epic and a glorious entry into what is quickly becoming the most entertaining movie trilogy since the original Star Wars series. I was left perfectly contented by the time things came to their expected cliffhanger of a conclusion, and I’m beyond positive The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a motion picture I’ll happily watch multiple times in the future.

"Jun 11, 2003",POSITIVE,The Two Towers is riveting entertainment - few films could cover such distance (in both narrative and geographical senses) with such assurance - but it remains hard to explain with great certainty the details of the plot.
"Mar 30, 2003",POSITIVE,It's a delightful gift to the world.
"Mar 18, 2003",POSITIVE,A Glorious Spectacle Unsurpassed - until The King Returns
"Mar 11, 2003",POSITIVE,"'A hell of a movie', dirían los yanquis."
"Mar 7, 2003",POSITIVE," You'd better get reading - unless you're up to speed on the story so far, part two of Tolkien's trilogy could be a baffling experience. You can see why the title of The Two Towers, Peter Jackson's new Tolkien film, has caused a certain disquiet in the US by coincidentally evoking associations with the World Trade Centre's Twin Towers. Nonetheless, I'm glad he stuck with it. As it happens, in this installment of the trilogy, allegorical echoes of September 11 and its aftermath can be heard all over Middle-earth.  I realise that such a reading would have outraged Tolkien, who rejected all attempts to draw parallels between his mythical world and our own. But the temptation is irresistible - especially right now. As we rejoin the Hobbits, their faith in the power of good has been shaken to its foundations. The great wizard, Gandalf (Ian McKellen), is no more, and in the black fortress of Isengard, his evil counterpart, Saruman (Christopher Lee) is gathering an army of mass destruction. What's more, there's no way of getting weapons inspectors in. To be honest, I'm not one of Tolkien's fans. This doesn't mean I fail to respect their clout. It's the reason Jackson feels confident enough to plunge in here precisely where he left off at the end of part one. There is no wimpy recapping of earlier events. We're shown Frodo (Elijah Wood) reliving Gandalf's defeat in a dream sequence, and that's it for exposition.  If you're not already on board, you scrabble around as best you can, and this means hard work, which is something rare - and yes, exhilarating - in a modern blockbuster. While getting your bearings in Middle-earth, you have to keep pace with rapidly multiplying sub-plots and newly introduced species.  Along with the Orcs, the Elves, the Hobbits and the Khazad are the Ents, the Ringwraiths and the Uruk-Hai. And if you're already confused, preliminary research is advisable. Or not.  The alternative is just to concentrate on Gollum, a creature of such unnerving weirdness that he alone is enough to make this episode an infinitely more involving proposition than the last. Created by laying a computer-generated image over the movements of an actor (Andy Serkis) wearing a body-hugging speedskater's suit, Gollum is both ancient and child-like, hideous and pitiful.  When we catch up with him, he's nearly 600 years old - a naked, bat-eared, goblin-like figure bleached to a skeletal whiteness by the centuries of travail and torture, brought upon him by his obsession with the Ring and the power it bestows.  A minute spent in his bony, spectral presence is a far creepier experience than any number of poundings by Jackson's massed armies of the night.  Gollum is out to steal the Ring for himself - or the bad part of him is. His benign half knows it should help Frodo destroy it and so save the world. And as he does battle with himself over this eternal dilemma, you feel as if you could be eavesdropping on the White House hawks as they beat back the odd dove in their midst during debates about foreign policy. Ranging further through Middle-earth, and giving you a better sense of Tolkien's philosophies - pro-ecology and anti-technology to the point of making him a Luddite - this film is a better-paced effort than the first. It also introduces a bunch of new characters, among them an uncharacteristically stern-faced David Wenham as the ruler of the Human stronghold of Gondor, and Miranda Otto as a princess of Rohan, the kingdom under threat from Saruman's armies. Otto's role is the film's big disappointment. Advance word led to expectations of a fully functioning warrior princess. Instead, she's allowed only a couple of Ninja-like flourishes with her broadsword before being sent back to join the womenfolk. Which brings me to the main trouble with Tolkien and his cold-climate mythology, and it goes beyond the complaint that women are relegated to bit players. His gods and demi-gods are so drearily chaste. Not for him the blithe omnisexuality of the Hindu and Mediterranean gods, who regard power and eroticism as interchangeable. He's not even into Arthurian notions of licensed flirtation. His preferred method of romance is by remote control - a case of abstinence making the heart grow fonder.  You sense him nodding approvingly when Hugo Weaving's Elf king is moved to lecture his daughter Arwen (Liv Tyler) on the miseries to come if she insists on pursuing her cross-species love affair with the mortal hero, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen). He'll grow old and die and she'll be forced to watch before wandering off to spend the rest of her days in weary solitude. What still excites me most about the films are the behind-the-scenes adventures which went into their making. Jackson pledged his down under armies of craftsmen, technicians and special effects people to his cause, took it to the gates of Hollywood and returned with the money to make these things. Even more to his credit, the adventure continues."
"Feb 21, 2003",POSITIVE,"If the first film was a hearty appetizer, the second film is a full course dinner. I can't wait to see what Jackson serves us for dessert."
"Feb 17, 2003",POSITIVE,The film's crowning glory remains the battle at Helm's Deep and can best be described as Braveheart meets The Alamo; it'll keep your heart leaping into your throat at every turn.
"Feb 16, 2003",POSITIVE,The greatest fantasy epic of all-time continues with a mesmerizing middle chapter that leaves great hopes for the thrilling conclusion.
"Feb 8, 2003",POSITIVE,It would be an enormous task for Jackson to outdo last year's phenomenon ...And yet he pretty much does just that.
"Feb 7, 2003",POSITIVE,"While this structure slows down ostensible forward motion, it also allows each crew to showcase its star performer and some scenery."

"Jan 14, 2003",POSITIVE," Gird your loins, buckle your armor, take a deep breath and plunge yourself into the dark, fierce epic that is part two of ""The Lord of the Rings."" That Peter Jackson and his remarkable team have done it again is no surprise. Most of it was shot at the same time as the first, so it wasn't apt to fall apart. Still, what's remarkable is how immediately, after a full year, ""The Two Towers"" seizes your attention, and how urgently it holds you through three seamless, action-packed hours. The Fellowship had split apart when last we saw them, and the new film follows three separate trails. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), heading for Mordor to destroy the Ring, are joined in their quest by an emaciated, suspiciously servile creature named Gollum, who offers to serve as their guide. Elsewhere in Middle Earth, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) and Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom) come to the aid of King Theoden of Rohan (Bernard Hill), who must defend his kingdom against Saruman's terrifying army of Orcs and Uruk-hai. In the Forest of Fangorn, the two hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) are rescued from their captors by an Ent named Treebeard, an ancient walking and talking tree, who must be persuaded to join arms with the humans, the hobbits and the Elves to defend Middle Earth from the evil Sauron. At stake is... everything. ""The Two Towers"" takes more liberties with Tolkien than ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" did; it's also more violent and nightmarish. But Jackson, a master of scale and perspective, doesn't let it become claustrophobic. Few people can stage a battle--and the eyepopping siege of Helms Deep is one of the most spectacular you'll ever see--with such sweep and clarity that the carnage doesn't seem an oppressive end in itself. The tale never loses touch with its human core. Amid all the surreal visions, terrifying monsters and overwhelming landscapes, it's the naked, skinny, schizophrenic Gollum who snakes his way most deeply into your memory. Created digitally with a motion-capture technique that mimicked the movements of actor Andy Serkis (who also supplied his hissing voice), Gollum is a previously hobbitlike creature, grotesquely deformed by having once possessed the Ring. While everyone else in Tolkien's myth falls neatly into the camps of Good and Evil, the self-lacerating Gollum is at war with himself. In an epic drenched in medievalism, he's the dangerously ambiguous voice of the modern. Martin Scorsese's lavish, wildly ambitious epic of 1860s New York takes the audience down some of the meaner streets in American history. It's set in Five Points, a crime-ridden slum where recently arrived immigrants are pitted against brutally xenophobic nativists, and anarchy is held at bay (just barely) by the tribal dictates of competing gangs with names like the Plug Uglies, the Daybreak Boys and the Dead Rabbits. The scariest and most powerful of the local warlords is William Cutting, a.k.a. Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis), a one-eyed nativist who would just as soon carve up an Irishman as a slice of pork. ""Gangs of New York"" culminates in the violent Draft Riots of 1863, and as a dark, diligently researched history lesson, it fascinates and enlightens. The problem is with the drama in the foreground. This tale of revenge, in which young Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) comes to the Five Points to kill the Butcher--the man who murdered his father--takes a mighty long time to engage your emotions. It doesn't fully catch fire until the ""Hamlet""-like midsection when Amsterdam, having been treated as a surrogate son by the unwitting Bill, first tries and fails to kill him. Bill's a vibrant villain, and a stunningly theatrical Day-Lewis plays him to the hilt. But our hero remains one-dimensional, and the usually spontaneous DiCaprio seems constrained by the part. It doesn't help that his romance with Cameron Diaz's pickpocket prostitute falls back on first-they-kiss-then-they-fight cliches. Scorsese seems most engaged in the violent set pieces, which have a brutal, terrifying poetry. But a cloak of artifice hangs over the movie. ""Gangs"" is a dream project Scorsese has wanted to make for 30 years. You have to honor its mad ambition. But sadly, it feels like a dream too long deferred. The teenage runaway Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) was a child prodigy of crime. By the time he was arrested at 21 he had cashed millions of dollars in forged checks and had successfully impersonated an airline pilot, a doctor, a lawyer and a university teacher, with a combination of charm, charisma and chutzpah. His true story (cleverly adapted by Jeff Nathanson) is the basis for former child prodigy Steven Spielberg's zippy ""Catch Me If You Can,"" a delicious cat-and-mouse game flecked with intriguing Oedipal undertones. As the mercurial mouse, DiCaprio sparkles, far more comfortable in the ever-changing skin of this slick chameleon than he is in Scorsese's epic. The dogged cat is FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (a droll, buttoned-down Tom Hanks), always one methodical step behind his prey. As Hanratty's pursuit drags on from year to year, his resolve never wavers, but his enmity evolves into an almost paternal concern for his young foe. Meanwhile, Frank's real dad, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken), looms behind his son's every larcenous deed. He's a charming, fast-talking failure whose slippery relationship with the truth and firm belief in the importance of appearances provide the template for his son's life of deception. Walken's performance is hilarious, poignant and full of surprises. It's nice to see Spielberg in a larky, relatively modest spirit. ""Catch Me"" is never less than engaging; all that's missing is a proper crescendo. The picture moves along briskly, even at two and a half hours, but it seems to be running on cruise control. Spielberg has caught the sunny, primary-color spirit of the prewar '60s, the American optimism that Frank Jr. both exemplifies and parodies. Frank lives life as if he were an actor in a movie, his costumes determining his identity, his fate dependent on improv, with all the mundane, boring parts (school, job training) edited out. Like Spielberg, he's a firm believer in cutting to the chase. Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones put on quite a show in Rob Marshall's dazzling cinematic rethinking of the 1975 Kander and Ebb musical directed by Bob Fosse. The setting is Prohibition-era Chicago, and our antiheroines are two bitter rivals, aspiring singer Roxie Hart (Zellweger) and vaudeville star Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones), both jailed for killing their men. There's nothing like notoriety to jump-start a career, Roxie reasons; she hires legendary lawyer Billy Flynn (a tap-dancing Richard Gere) to plead her case, and parlays murder into celebrity. When I saw the 1995 Broadway revival, late in its run, the show's cynical bite needed dentures. Now director-choreographer Marshall, screenwriter Bill Condon and a cast that includes Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly (who knew he could sing and dance?) have restored its teeth. The musical numbers are now presented as figments of Roxie's spotlight-lusting imagination, and the movie flows back and forth--stylishly, fluidly--between reality and illusion. On the surface, Zellweger isn't the tough cookie we associate with the role (a gum-chewing Ginger Rogers played her in the 1942 ""Roxie Hart""), but her veneer of vulnerability makes her venom effective. (Who knew she could sing and dance?) ""Chicago"" is exuberantly theatrical yet every inch a movie, and some numbers (""The Cell Block Tango"") are so entertaining you might want to applaud. First ""Moulin Rouge,"" now this. Could the movie musical be making a comeback? Roman Polanski escaped from the Cracow ghetto when he was 7 years old. Until now, he has avoided making a film about the Holocaust, though you could feel its shadow behind every movie he has made. ""The Pianist,"" the first feature he's made in Poland since his 1962 ""Knife in the Water,"" isn't autobiographical. It's based on the memoirs of Wladyslaw Szpilman, an acclaimed concert pianist who miraculously survived the Nazi occupation of Warsaw. But you can feel it was made by a man who's been there. It's in the little details, in its refusal of sentimentality, in its cleareyed assessment of the depths people will descend to--Jews, Poles and Germans alike--as well as the heights to which they rise. The objective tone--a detachment that contains pools of rage and sorrow--is set by Szpilman himself, who never raises his voice in his memoirs. Nor does Adrien Brody, who plays him here with soulful elegance. At first, Szpilman is an urbane, slightly aloof onlooker of the approaching nightmare. Then, when he and his family are herded into the Warsaw ghetto, the man who has everything becomes a man who has nothing. Saved from deportation to the camps by a Jewish turncoat guard--the rest of his family are not so lucky--he eventually escapes from the ghetto, only to become a hunted man, alone, sickly, hiding for his life. English playwright Ronald Harwood's screenplay sticks close to Szpilman's book, showing us everything through the protagonist's eyes. The Warsaw ghetto uprising is seen only as it's glimpsed through the window of Szpilman's hideout just outside the ghetto walls. For long stretches of his confinement, he's more a witness than a participant in the drama: we see, through him, the spectacle of a great city reduced to physical and moral rubble. Polanski shows us shocking visions--Nazi soldiers hurling an invalid off a balcony, a starving man licking spilled soup off the dirty ghetto pavement--but he never hypes up the horror for effect. ""The Pianist"" is all the more harrowing, and moving, for this restraint. This powerful, precision-made movie offers hope as well--an act of kindness from a German officer that saves the pianist's life, the music that sustains his soul. In going home to tell Szpilman's story Polanski seems reborn: once again he's become a filmmaker who matters."

"Dec 29, 2002",POSITIVE," The immediate question, of course, is whether The Two Towers lives up to The Fellowship of the Ring, and the answer is … not quite. But that’s not a complete answer, since The Two Towers is, in many respects, a very different film than its predecessor in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It’s much more of a Grand Epic, so it’s somewhat less thoughtful than the first film by its very nature. As a result, it lacks a good bit of Fellowship’s emotional intensity. There is nothing in The Two Towers, for instance, that carries the same emotional resonance as the first film’s final scene of Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) in the boat, nor is there anything to conclude this new entry that bears the same kind of punch as the The Two Towers’ closing shot. Those reservations aside, the second film is a remarkable achievement — and a groundbreaking one. The Two Towers follows Frodo and Sam’s further attempts to return the ring of power to the fires from whence it came, while the film separately details the adventures of Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and also deals with the resurrection of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the fates of hobbits Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominc Monaghan). It’s a huge canvas — and there is more to it than even this list of principal characters indicates — but Peter Jackson details it all so lovingly and so carefully that the movie never confuses. Moreover, the timing of individual sequences — the nature of the narrative requiring much cross-cutting between characters — is beyond reproach. At no time do you ever get the sense that you’ve stayed away from one story line for too long; Jackson and his co-writers have scored a major triumph in this regard. And in so many others as well. There is simply no way a review can begin to discuss or even catalogue the immense riches of The Two Towers, so I’ll settle on discussing a few of its finer points. First of all, it’s a movie that is both very much of its time, and one that is steeped in the history of film. For example, scene after scene in the court of Theoden (Bernard Hill) — especially those featuring Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif) — look for all the world as if they came straight out of Sergei Eisenstein’s Ivan the Terrible. For that matter, Wormtongue might well have been visually modeled on Eisenstein’s Ivan. Also, check out the film’s amazing battle scenes — possibly the most stunning and beautifully logical of their kind ever committed to film — and you’ll see filmmaking obviously grounded in the combat scenes from Orson Welles’ Chimes at Midnight. Yet The Two Towers is ultimately very modern; a work of this scale could only have been possible through technological advances in the CGI realm — the film, in fact, offers the most convincing work of its kind to date. Forget the computer-generated Yoda in Lucas’ Attack of the Clones and all previous efforts to meld CGI characters with real actors; The Two Towers delivers the goods. The movie’s CGI-created character Gollum is wholly believable as a real entity interacting with the live actors. Indeed, Andy Serkis (who provides the voice of the hyper-paranoid Gollum, and who also served as the model for the character’s movements) is so convincing and so powerful in the role that Serkis — who doesn’t actually appear in the film — is being suggested for Best Supporting Actor consideration! Possibly even more remarkable is the film’s depiction of the enigmatic tree creatures the Ents. The image of ambulatory trees — no matter how well done — could easily have toppled over into the risible, but Jackson and his co-writers have deftly sidestepped this possibility by taking a tip from Lord of the Rings author J.R.R. Tolkien, and making the creatures amusing from the onset. By having it take nigh on forever for the Ents to conclude that Pippin and Merry aren’t the enemy Orcs, and by reworking Tolkien’s dialogue concerning the length of time it takes the Ents to say anything in their own language (“We do not say anything … unless it is worth taking a long time to say and to listen to” ), the film invites us to deliberately laugh with it so that we don’t laugh at it. It’s a brilliant stroke, and it pays off handsomely. But it’s just one of many brilliant strokes by a filmmaker who isn’t afraid to run the risk of looking foolish — and as a result, almost never does. Instead, Jackson reaches out and touches on true greatness. The Two Towers is, after all, a huge movie, and everything about it ought to be huge. What is perhaps most remarkable is the film’s position as the developmental center of the Lord of the Rings saga Jackson is telling; as such, it lacks both a proper beginning and ending in itself. And yet it never feels incomplete. The movie is whole unto itself, even though its lacks the first film’s sense of concluding on an emotional high point. Go see The Two Towers for yourself — and then see it again. Let it amaze you with its wonders, its size and its rich complexity.

"Dec 23, 2002",NEGATIVE," What does it say about the second installment of Peter Jacksons The Lord of the Rings that the best performance is by a special effect? Just glimpsed at the end of last years The Fellowship of the Ring, Gollum, whos voiced by Andy Serkis (hes being touted by New Line Studio as an Oscar candidate), is the closest thing this centerpiece of Peter Jacksons adaptation of the Tolkien trilogy has to dramatic depth or conflict. This digitally rendered homunculus is the former owner of the Ring of Power; now debased into a sibilant, loin-clothed junkie craving his Precious fix, hes like Laurence Oliviers Richard III compared with the stiff-upper-lipped fortitude or leering villainy of the rest of the cast. But nuanced characterizations and performances are not what you expect from Epics, or high-tech video games, and The Two Towers is more of the latter than the former. As Jackson gets deeper into Tolkiens tale (and he shows here the same cinematic efficiency  if less clarity  in translating the complicated and intricately detailed narrative onto the screen with the minimum of deletions and changes), he seems to get farther from its spirit, its emotion, and its magic. The spectacle of thousands of Orcs charging on giant hyenas or hundreds of towering Ents striding across a blighted landscape impresses only so much before you want to reach for a joy stick and get in on the action yourself. The sight of a transfigured Gandalf galloping on his white charger might stir Messianic comparisons, but he also looks like a geeky, generic wizard astride a unicorn. The way special effects can make Tolkiens fantasy literal undermines ones capacity to believe in it and underscores the adolescent inclinations of those who manage to do so. Some poetry does remain  for example, the Miltonic fall of Gandalf. He thrashes with the evil Balrog barring the Fellowships passage through the Mines of Moria en route to Mordor so Frodo (Elijah Wood), the Ring bearer, can cast his burden into the fires of Mount Doom. Its all a dream  Frodos recurring nightmare of that awful moment that splintered the Fellowship, and the story. We thus have three narrative lines, and Jackson sustains them with admirable coherence. Frodo and his faithful servant Sam (Sean Astin) have set off alone to Mordor over snow-topped mountains in a trek reminiscent of Dorothy and companys assault on the Wicked Witchs castle. Their friends Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan) have been captured by a gang of mutant Orcs. And the moody human wanderer Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), along with the Dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies, whose comedy is a welcome but infrequent relief) and the Elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), have set off to find them. The wanderings of this last group take them to the human outposts of Rohan and Gondor, where decadent realms must regird their loins to face the evil onslaught of Sauron and his lackey, the turncoat wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee). Meanwhile, Pippin and Merry have taken refuge with Treebeard (another winning special effect) and his ancient ambulatory tree people the Ents. And the hopeless task of Frodo and Sam is made easier and more complicated by the appearance of the tormented Gollum, whos the twisted mirror image of Frodo himself. And you thought keeping Qatar, Uzbekistan, and Yemen straight was difficult. In fact, though the subtext gets buried beneath the many, many battle scenes, for this lapsed Tolkien fan the parallels to contemporary events are where the real interest lies. Tolkien denied that his work was an allegory, and he may be right. Its more of a template, a vivid outline of the power struggles endemic to history, its application shifting with each new look and new era. In the first cinematic episode, I thought the evildoers Sauron and Saruman were stand-ins for bin Laden and al-Qaeda and the Axis of Evil. But now Im not so sure. As Saruman cuts down all the trees in his kingdom, strip-mines its resources, and mechanizes his realm into a polluting cistern of mindless clones, it looks more like a Republican vision of America. And if you straightened out Gollums posture a bit and put him in a suit and a tie and a cowboy hat . . ."

"Dec 23, 2002",NEGATIVE," “The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers” suffers slightly from being the second story in a trilogy, where the imaginative exposition is behind you and the thrilling conclusion is yet to come.  But the second film is, in many ways, imaginative and thrilling, and though it may turn out to be the least of the three “Lord of the Rings” films, it is still more visceral and engaging than nearly any other action/adventure film this year.  It picks up a few days after “Fellowship” left off, with three separate threads to follow. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are heading for Mordor to destroy the titular ring, trailed by the simpering Gollum (voice of Andy Serkis), who was once owner of the ring. Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have been abducted by Orcs. Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are searching for Merry and Pippin, but soon have other worries to attend to — specifically, evil Saruman (Christopher Lee), who is planning an all-out war on the world.  Director Peter Jackson, co-writing again with Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Stephen Sinclair, offers much of the same spirit as the first film, with the same unexpected humor and the same keen understanding of what makes the story more than just a three-hour chunk of popcorn escapism.  He has also, with the help of technology that I don’t pretend to understand, given us Gollum — hands-down the most authentic, convincing computer-animated character in movie history. Unlike Jar Jar Binks and Dobby the house elf, Gollum actually seems to have mass and occupy space. There is no suspension of disbelief required. He also has a soul, and, amazingly, pulls off his conflicted arguments with himself as well as any flesh-and-blood actor could. It will seem strange to look at the “Two Towers” row at the Oscars ceremony and not see Gollum there, sitting next to Elijah Wood and Ian McKellen.  Shooting all three films at once was a gamble, but it has paid off. They bear the mark of having been cut from the same cloth, rather than being watered-down, like most sequels. The millions of people who loved last year’s triumph will find just as much to love this time. "
"Dec 23, 2002",POSITIVE,"For those who value a steady build to utter intensity, The Two Towers is a grand achievement."

There is nothing inherently wrong with remakes'many notable directors have remade their own films, including Alfred Hitchcock, Yasujiro Ozu, and John Ford, to name a few'although they always bear the weight of comparison with 'the original,' which is often erroneously though better simply for having been around longer.

"Dec 23, 2002",POSITIVE,"An even better film than the first: more deeply felt, more vividly imagined, acted with greater assurance and assembled with the confidence of a master craftsman."
"Dec 23, 2002",POSITIVE," If further proof was needed that New Zealand director Peter Jackson is one of the most crushingly talented filmmakers the world has ever seen, then this sequel is surely it, and a pox on those who consider the swords-and-sorcery storyline of the J.R.R. Tolkien mythos to be somehow less than deserving of praise because of a few errant dwarves and dragons. Antonioni it's not, but this sequel to last year's Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is positively astounding in the depth and breadth of its massive, multitiered story arc, its wholly identifiable characters (human and otherwise), and the sheer magnitude of the vision involved in its creation. To put it (very) bluntly, this one kicks some serious butt, at once a fanboy's wet dream of adaptive near-perfection and an engaging, emotionally supercharged epic adventure that will doubtless take pride of place alongside other genre classics and beyond. Effusive praise, I know, but it's hardly hyperbole. Unlike it's Oscar-laden predecessor, The Two Towers is a far more expansive film, with the characters of the first film now far-flung across Middle-earth. Hobbit Frodo (Wood) is on his quest to the cursed land of Mordor to destroy the hellish Ring. He travels with friend Sam (Astin), while the other hobbit pair Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan, Boyd) are captured by Saruman (Lee), and warriors Aragorn (Mortensen), Legolas (Bloom), and dwarf Gimli eventually meet up for the Battle of Helm's Deep, a colossal stone fortress cut into the side of a mountain, while the mighty armies of darkness mass outside. While The Fellowship of the Ring was a much more introspective, thoughtful film punctuated by the occasional skirmish, this one is rife with some of the most impressive battle sequences ever committed to film. The final battle at Helm's Deep is nothing short of awe-inspiring; it's a cinematic achievement on a par with Ben Hur's chariot race, Lawrence of Arabia's equally outsized desert conflicts, and the final raid on Lucas' Death Star. It's that good. Add to this a host of new characters in an already crowded cast, and this second film (in what will ultimately be a trilogy) is more fun than humans ought to be allowed. The hideous Gollum, an entirely CGI creation voiced by Andy Serkis, is a masterful achievement in and of itself, but its integration among the human actors and real-world environments is nearly flawless. A scrawny, whining coveter of the Ring with oversized, pasty eyes and a seriously schizophrenic streak, Gollum is at the dark heart of the trilogy, a seemingly minor character who becomes the dirty pegboard upon which the fate of Middle-earth will dangle. Wood is again fine as reluctant Frodo, a hero in the classical mode, stuck traversing hell itself when he would really much rather be home gnawing thistle. There's barely a weak performance in the bunch, and did I mention the astonishing CGI work? The Ents â huge, living trees that act as shepherds of the forests â are a jaw-dropping creation, as are the colossal armies that evil Sauron has marshaled to his command. The only drawback to this terrific, three-hour film may rest in its gigantic sprawl: At times it's almost too much to take in. God forbid this should ever play on an IMAX screen â the concussive soundtrack and relentless visuals would likely strike viewers deaf and blind (but what a way to go!). Simply breathtaking.

"Dec 23, 2002",POSITIVE," If George Lucas was supposed to usher digital filmmaking into the 21st century with his Star Wars prequels, it's fair to say that Peter Jackson has stolen his thunder. With The Two Towers, the second installment in Jackson's trilogy based on J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved fantasy epic, the New Zealand director crafts another awe-inspiring vision that wholly transports you to the dark netherworld of middle-Earth. Delivering on the promise of what the Star Wars prequels were supposed to be, Jackson delights with seamless CG-effects, strong storytelling, and more compelling characters than anything found in that galaxy far, far away. Lacking any sort of beginning, The Two Towers launches you into its story as if you just pressed the pause button on your DVD player. Slightly disorienting, the effect makes it immediately apparent that the director envisioned his trilogy as one lengthy film (the way he shot it). As such, he throws the viewer into the story with little care that they might have forgotten the details of The Fellowship of the Ring. Oddly enough, as with Fellowship, this tactic isn't frustrating and it doesn't make the film feel incomplete; rather, it adds to the epic scope of the project, making it seem like yet another piece of the puzzle in this over-arching story. Focusing on the disparate journeys of the Fellowship, which has geographically disbanded and left small pockets of the original group scattered about middle-Earth, The Two Towers follows three basic storylines. The first one revolves around Frodo, who is still traipsing about the planet with the Ring. Being worn down by its overwhelming power, Frodo (who is accompanied by his friend Sam) is attempting to bring the Ring to safekeeping. In order to do so, the two Hobbits employ the help of a slithery, cave-dwelling creature named Gollum, to serve as their guide. Gollum, who once had the Ring in his possession and has clearly been destroyed by the item he calls ""my precious,"" is overcome by a devil-angel complex that leaves both of the little fellows wondering if the imp is friend or foe. The second subplot, and the most minor one, traces the journey of the two other Hobbits in the Fellowship: Merry and Pippin. Initially captured by Orcs, the two escape and fall into favor with a living, talking, tree that journeys with them across the continent. The final, and most involved, story focuses on the remaining warriors from the Fellowship: Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. Preparing to take on the army of Orcs that Saruman was manufacturing in the first film, the warriors hook up with a bunch of humans from a place called Rohan. There, the trio ready themselves for what seems like a David and Goliath match-up (the Orcs outnumber the humans by an astonishing figure), holing up in a damn-like structure to stave off the Orc army (which, it's worth noting, is intended to wipe out the race of man). Of course, like The Fellowship of the Ring, the plot of The Two Towers is finally unimportant. Unlike both The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, which were more focusing on laying groundwork than telling interesting stories, Jackson's films relay a lot of plot detail, without ever becoming flat. Strikingly similar to the first film in the series, The Two Towers offers up more of the same visual pyrotechnics matched with intelligent storytelling. Slight on the social commentary (the film touches on issues of imperialism, racism, and industrialization, but doesn't finally say much about any of those topics), The Two Towers is nonetheless a gratifying and exciting second chapter in what's proving to be the seminal sci-fi epic of the new century."

"Dec 20, 2002",POSITIVE," 
Producer/co-writer/director Peter Jackson's second installment of the trilogy doesn't just eclipse the first film. Its production design, CGI (computer-generated imagery), storytelling (with, of course, all appropriate credit to J.R.R. Tolkien) and performances put George Lucas's recent ""Star Wars"" cycle to intergalactic shame. And ""Towers"" doesn't even have to leave Middle-earth to do it.
 
It's not that Jackson has bigger weapons than Lucas – he certainly doesn't. It's that the New Zealander takes such greater organic care with the small details – the humor, the intimate acting moments, the framing of the picture, even the makeup – which makes those bigger elements seem bigger still.
 
And speaking of small-scale brilliance, Jackson has created the most memorable CGI creature since Shrek, a raspy-voiced, bug-eyed creature known as Gollum, who brings suspense, poignancy and wild-card weirdness to this three-hour fantasy.
 
As the movie opens, the members of the Fellowship – broken up into three groups now – are still shaken by the apparent death of their aging guide and wizard, Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellan).
 
Frodo (Elijah Wood) and fellow hobbit Sam (Sean Astin) continue their quest to find Mordor, the only place where they can destroy the evil power of the ring. And fellow hobbits Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan) have been captured by the Uruk-hai, the animalistic soldiers that terrorize the land.
 
Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) the human, Legolas (Orlando Bloom) the elf, and Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies), still searching for their missing comrades, arrive at the kingdom of the Rohan, where King Theoden (Bernard Hill) is under the spell of the dark wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee).
 
The conflicts are many. To avoid Saruman and his hordes of Uruk-hai, Aragorn and company help Theoden and his followers escape to a fortress known as Helm's Deep. Pippin and Merry escape their captors only to find themselves, literally, in the clutches of a giant walking-and-talking tree called Treebeard (voiced by Rhys-Davies).
 
Frodo must continually resist the alluring power offered by the ring around his neck. And he has to contend with Gollum, a mysterious being who appears from nowhere, promising to lead him and Sam to Mordor. Is Gollum leading them to a trap? Frodo has a big decision to make.
 
McKellan gives Gandalf powerful gravitas as Gandalf the White. In a movie of quasi-cartoonish texture, his presence  gives the movie impressive weight. But the standout character is Gollum. Part human actor (Andy Serkis) and a whole lot of CGI embellishment, he's a critter-cum-satyr with sharp teeth, stringy hair, enormous blue eyes and a voice that suggests a cross between a baby with laryngitis and a satanic kitten. He leaps effortlessly from rock to rock. He wears a loincloth. He is truly an extraordinary being. And he's possessed by two personalities – one nice and sweet, the other a tormented (and tormenting) demon. Gollum doesn't just steal scenes, he chomps them whole. He's the anti-Jar Jar.
 
Gollum is but one in a constellation of diverse delights that includes trees that talk, rise and walk with lofty majesty; an extraordinarily lyrical sojourn through marshes where dead souls lie just beneath the watery surface; and a rousing, medieval-styled battle with a castle, siege weapons and a seemingly endless outpouring of Uruk-hais. And somewhere in the nether-center of this all, you can feel not just the power and sureness of  Jackson's direction, but his boyish wonder. In the end, that wonder is the ultimate compass. And he never loses sight of it.

Good is still cute, bad is still monstro-evil, the landscapes still green, the Hobbits barefoot and dressed like Victorian squires, the warriors handsome, the milieu kitschy. And ignorant armies still clash by night.
 
Where are we now? What place is this? We are in myth. It's an artificial myth, invented only in the last century by a fussy Oxford don with too much time on his hands, but it's still convincing, gripping, whole and nourishing. Certainly of the fantasy film series currently in American theaters Â¿ I include ""Harry Potter and the Secret Toity"" and ""Star Trek: Halitosis"" Â¿ ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is the best, and not by just a little.
 
It alone among them transcends. It works as story for the common narrative-starved fool, who needs heroic example and pulsating, vicariously energizing experiences of love and hate. You don't have to be one of those Hobbit-like geeks who've lost themselves in this world so intensely there is no other Â¿ though I hasten to add that there's nothing wrong with knowing more about Middle Earth than, er, Earth. You can Â¿ and this is the cool part Â¿ enjoy dual citizenship in the world where trees launch assaults on castles and the one where bills come due. Whichever citizenship you claim, you walk out and you think, that was a hell of a story.
 
What the director Peter Jackson brings to this second installment is exactly what he brought to the first, which is also what makes, come to think of it, a pretty good middle linebacker: power, speed and cunning. Jackson's not messing around. His commitment to this world is total. He's on a mission from Tolkien, and you either go along or you get trampled.
 
Of course, one can still track certain irritations. Elijah Wood, as the game little hero Hobbit, Frodo Baggins, still relies entirely too much on a single expression: It's that stricken look, as if he's just learned that not only didn't he get into Harvard but he has been banned from ever setting foot in Massachusetts. It's really not acting, it's face-making. Here's how you do it: First, sky-blue contacts. Then, in front of a mirror, make your mouth an open square. Flare your nostrils. Wrinkle that brow. Really, really, squish it up good. Open your eyes to about f/1. Tighten your throat. Suck in your cheeks. There, you are now indistinguishable from the bearer of the One True Ring.
 
Other shortcomings? The Ents. Ents, not ants. An Ent is a big tree. Or, rather, it is a majestic sentinel of the forest, meant to guard all that is green and good about the world, mainly other trees. But of the brilliant digitized illusions conjured by the film, most of them wondrous and palpable at the same time, the Ents, it must be said, are kind of a disappointment. I mean, come on: They're just trees. Most people will think of the trees that were hornswoggled into throwing apples by the Scarecrow in ""The Wizard of Oz""; these guys are taller and tougher and they appear to have no apples, but they still walk like the kind of tragic human specimens that are over seven feet tall but not coordinated enough for basketball. In other words, they aren't Yao Ming, they are Manute Bol. Particularly when they march, they just look silly, and when they go to war, their attack is somehow the least convincing, a letdown in a story whose strength is that it drags us through the charnel house of medieval warfare.
 
And finally, the hair. I suppose if you're shooting three movies back to back on the other side of the world and it's one of the biggest gambles ever in the entertainment industry, a detail might have slipped your mind. In Jackson's case, that little detail was shampoo. He either couldn't afford it or he forgot all about it. The result is that you never saw so many greasy, tangled, thorny, wet, lusterless protein brambles as are on display in this movie. Viggo Mortensen, with a haircut that looks like a drowned swamp rat floating belly up in a bayou, leads the troop. A man named Viggo ought to do better than this.
 
Tell me you don't want plot. You don't, do you? You do. Ach. Well, the movie takes off directly from where the last one left us, and basically three plot strains are followed, each strain a journey across Middle Earth. The team whose formation was the essence of the first film is now broken up, and we watch as three Â¿ two teams of two Hobbits, and one team of three warriors Â¿ journey across the world, each on a mission, while various larger forces gather to unleash destruction.
 
Team A of Hobbits consists of Frodo (Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin). Frodo has the One Ring, and his job is to get across Middle Earth and penetrate the topless towers of Mordor and there dump the ring into a volcano to destroy it and restore harmony to the world. But he must do this without wearing the ring, which would corrupt his character.
 
Team B in the Hobbit League is Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), who are going somewhere that no Web site seems to know. They are the ones who get caught up by the Ents, and when war breaks out, it is they who leverage the Ents into a counterattack against one of the towers.
 
Because I have no imagination for little critters, I preferred the third team, comprising warriors Aragorn (Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom). They could have sailed in from that old Viking dragon ship on the beach there, or perhaps they came with those Huns and their yurts off the Asian steppes, or possibly they fought with the Green Berets at Tan Phu, the Spartans at Thermopylae or Henry at Agincourt, but, no doubt about it, they are the soldiers and their business is war.
 
And that's really the business of ""The Two Towers"" and the business of director Jackson. In the end it's a medieval battle rhapsody and you can pretend the Uruk-hai are demons from the mud of Hell or Flemish mercenaries from beyond Hanover in the year 1642, and it really makes no difference at all. It's men in mud and rain, at a castle keep, in armor with spears and swords, and it's a long, long day's dying.
 
Jackson's imagination is most vividly provoked by the extreme nature of Bronze Age battle, for the last hour of ""The Two Towers"" is pure combat and it's mind-blowing. The scene is Helm's Deep, a castle moored against a rock escarpment that takes the full force of the Uruk-hai attack, while our three human heroes and the Rohanites stand fast. Some won't be able to watch the hackings and gougings, and some (e.g., moi) won't be able to look away.
 
But underneath it all is the same issue that defined Tolkien's life, the battle between Western democracy and monsters who wanted to destroy it. Read into it what you want, or read nothing into it, but it's really the oldest story of all. It's the one about a band of free men on a hilltop with nothing to get them through the night but their belief in themselves and their cause and the long steel they carry in their scabbards.
 
THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS (PG-13, 179 minutes) Â¿ Contains intense battle sequences, perhaps too intense for youngsters. It opens at midnight at several theaters, and later in the day at others.

Michael Horton; music: Howard Shore; cast: Elijah Wood (Frodo Baggins), Ian McKellen (Gandalf the White), Sean Astin (Samwise ‘Sam’ Gamgee), Andy Serkis (Gollum/Sméagol), Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), Christopher Lee (Saruman the White), John-Rhys Davies (Voice of Gimli/Ent), Dominic Monaghan (Meriadoc ‘Merry’ Brandybuck), Billy Boyd (Peregrin ‘Pippin’ Took), Bernard Hill (Théoden, King of Rohan), Mirando Otto (Éowyn), Karl Urban (Éomer), David Wenham (Faramir), Cate Blanchett (Galadriel), Orlando Bloom (Legolas Greenleaf), Brad Dourif (Gríma Wormtongue), Liv Tyler (Arwen), Hugo Weaving (Elrond), Sala Baker (Man Flesh Uruk), Craig Parker (Haldir); Runtime: 179; MPAA Rating: PG-13; producer: Barrie M. Osborne; New Line Cinema; 2002)“This version of the sinister classic tale of battle between the forces of good against evil even tops the brilliant first part because of the tremendous imaginative scope of its continuing story and all its graphic nonstop action scenes and fantastic overall visual effects.” New Zealander Peter Jackson’s brilliant 179 minutes long epic sword-and-sorcery adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien’s trilogy The Lord of the Rings resumes in its middle part and is entitled eerily enough “The Two Towers” (I can’t help thinking from the title about 9/11 and the attack on the WTC!). This version of the sinister classic tale of battle between the forces of good against evil even tops the brilliant first part because of the tremendous imaginative scope of its continuing story and all its graphic nonstop action scenes and fantastic overall visual effects. The story picks up without explanation in medias res where “Fellowship” left off. The hobbits chosen to save the world from evil are the heroic Frodo (Elijah Wood) and his loyal friend Sam (Sean Astin), who are lost in the hills of Emyn Muil (filmed in the stunningly gorgeous crags and peaks of New Zealand). They are journeying to Mordor to destroy the world-threatening One Ring. Frodo has been designated as the Ring bearer, as the good-hearted hobbits ventured out of their Shire for the first time in their lives. They are joined unceremoniously by a naked character but for a loincloth who is an absolute delight on the screen, the gibberish speaking, avaricious, nasty, split-personality, reptilian-like Gollum (a magnificent, computer-generated creation with human features, superbly voiced by Andy Serkis). Gollum, who became crazed because he held on to the ring for too long and whose body goes into all sorts of contortions as he talks to himself, first attacks the hobbits but is shortly captured by them and then Frodo bargains with the Gollum for his release if he can lead them to Mordor and promise to serve them and not attack them anymore. The fellowship that was organized to destroy the ring in the volcanic fires of Mount Doom for the benefit of the residents of Middle-earth has been splintered in battle. The hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) escaped from the terrifying Orcs who snatched them and wander through the enchanted Fangorn Forest where they’re adopted by an even more special creation, the curmudgeonly tree creature Treebeard (John Rhys-Davies); the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) has fallen presumably to his death into a canyon of fire and water while fighting the flying dragon Balrog (but amazingly returns resurrected as an angelic all-white aura); the human Boromir was slain by enemy soldiers; and, the hunky human Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) impossibly leads the kingdom of Rohan with only an army of 300 against an opposing army of as many as 10,000 Orcs trained by the evil sorcerer Saruman (Christopher Lee), who wants to rule the world, as the film builds to its last part huge climactic battle at the fortress at Helm’s Deep. The quest begins to turn around two colossal towers, each with a beastly army trying to reclaim the ring. The third part will open up from the end of the battle and with the hobbits prepared to finish their mission of destroying the ring and saving civilization from evil. “Two Towers” crosscuts at will among the three stories moving smoothly from one story to the next, as it has the prankster hobbits with the wise old Ent who takes his time deciding what to do about his captives, the heroic hobbits with their guide Gollum are seen pushing on to Mordant and encountering many dangers on the way, and the main story focuses on the adventures of Aragorn as he goes into battle and proves his real love for Arwen by not being tempted by the beautiful Eowyn. The final part of the trilogy will open next December and it will be filmed by the same excellent crew. To make things a bit easier for the viewer to follow this epic tale, which can be a chore to keep up with, I will provide the following primer to the “Lord of the Rings” characters as gathered from the press guide and from the AP’s Anthony Breznican. Frodo Baggins, hobbit, as performed by Elijah Wood. Growing up in the hobbits’ peaceful land, the Shire, Frodo longed for adventure. When he inherits the all-powerful One Ring from his elderly relative, Bilbo Baggins, Frodo must set off to destroy it to neutralize its awful power. Despite being small and without magic powers, he is able to withstand the ring’s temptations better than many others. He is the first to volunteer for the quest that leads to the formation of the fellowship. Gandalf, wizard, as performed by Ian McKellen. This powerful, magical being has a soft spot in his heart for the simplicity of the hobbits. After learning that his mentor, Saruman, has gone over to the side of evil, Gandalf helps Frodo in the quest to destroy the ring. Although Gandalf appears to die in the Mines of Moria, wizards can be reborn in more powerful forms. Samwise “Sam” Gamgee, hobbit, as performed by Sean Astin. Sam, a simple gardener, becomes a loyal ally to Frodo and promises Gandalf that he will protect his friend. When Frodo tries to flee the fellowship in a boat, for fear that the corrupting power of the ring will destroy them all, Sam nearly drowns trying to catch up with him. Frodo rescues Sam from the water and they set off together, with the ring, for Mount Doom. Aragorn, human, as performed by Viggo Mortensen. Eons earlier, Aragorn’s royal ancestor, Isildur, cut the ring from the hand of its creator, the evil Sauron. But instead of destroying the ring, Isildur became corrupted by its power and eventually lost it. Aragorn, heir to the throne, has avoided humans, living in the wilderness under the name Strider. Now he hopes to reverse his family legacy by helping Frodo on the mission to destroy the ring. Gimli, dwarf, as performed by John-Rhys Davies. The gruff, ax-wielding Gimli feels the dwarfs’ old animus toward the race of elves, but agrees to team up with one of them on the fellowship because he fears the power of the ring more. Gimli urges the group to take a shortcut through the Mines of Moria, where he is shocked to find an entire underground city of dwarfs has been destroyed. Legolas, elf, as performed by Orlando Bloom. An expert archer, Legolas puts aside his disdain for dwarfs and joins the fellowship. He and Gimli develop first a grudging respect and then real friendship that could be the seed of reconciliation between their feuding cultures. Peregrin “Pippin” Took and Meriadoc “Merry” Brandybuck, hobbits, as performed by Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan. These prankster friends become embroiled in the adventure when they run across Frodo and Sam during a pursuit by the wicked Ringwraiths. Later. in a fierce battle, they manage to steer the enemy away from Frodo but are captured themselves. Arwen, elf, as performed by Liv Tyler. Daughter of elf leader Elrond, this immortal princess is in love with the human Aragorn, and is willing to become mortal to spend her life with him. She saves a wounded Frodo from the Ringwraiths, and inspires Aragorn on his quest. Galadriel, elf, as performed by Cate Blanchett. This forest queen offers shelter to the fellowship and encouragement to Frodo, who fears he is too weak to keep the ring. Frodo tries to leave the ring in Galadriel’s care, but she rejects it, realizing that Frodo can resist its lure better than she. Elrond, elf, as performed by Hugo Weaving. The immortal Elrond was present at the battle in which Aragorn’s forefather chopped the ring from Sauron’s hand. Centuries later, weary from a lifetime of war, he explains the ring’s history and helps create the fellowship charged with destroying it. He is protective of his daughter, Arwen, and worried about her love for a human, Aragorn. Theoden, human, as performed by Bernard Hill. King of the land of Rohan, Theoden has fallen under the spell of Saruman through a spy planted in his kingdom. Although he intends to do good, the bewitched ruler is not in control of his power. Sauron, dark wizard, as performed by Sala Baker, Man Flesh Uruk, assorted special effects. Long ago, this dark lord gave rings to all the rulers of Middle-earth, promising them unlimited power. But he himself had another ring, which controlled the others and would give him dominance over all life — until the ring was cut from his hand in battle. His spirit survives through the One Ring, which was lost for centuries. From his tower in the Land of Mordor, he has been gathering his evil forces to find the ring and take it back. Saruman, wizard, as performed by Christopher Lee. Once a member of the Council of the Wise, this top-ranking wizard betrays Gandalf by succumbing to the temptations of Sauron. While using magic to thwart the fellowship, Saruman turns the lush countryside around his tower, Isengard, into an industrial furnace and builds an army of monsters. Ringwraiths, former humans, as performed by assorted stunt arists and special-effects. These nine horsemen were powerful kings and sorcerers before being corrupted by power and forced to serve Sauron. They hide beneath black cloaks and travel in search of the ring, to return it to their master. Orcs and Uruk-hai, ghoulish soldiers as performed by assorted stunt artists and special-effects. The orcs are savage, mutated cannibals who attack only in darkness because the sun weakens them. Sauron has commanded them in vast armies, but his ally Saruman breeds hybrid orcs called Uruk-hai, which are fiercer, stronger and impervious to light. Gollum, Stoor hobbit, as performed by Andy Serkis and computer animation. Gollum was once a Hobbit-like creature named Smeagol. After discovering the One Ring, his obsession with its power transforms him into a withered, hissing wretch. He calls the ring “My precious” and spends years searching for it after Bilbo takes it from his lair. Gollum is tortured by Sauron’s forces until he reveals Baggins’ name; he later refuses to chase Frodo and the ring. Grima Wormtongue, human, as performed by Brad Dourif. This duplicitous adviser to the King of Rohan has pledged his loyalty to Saruman and serves as a spy in the kingdom. Eowyn, human, as performed by Miranda Otto. Niece to King Theoden, she recognizes a leader in Aragorn and tests the warrior’s love for the elf Arwen. Eomer, human, as performed by Karl Urban. Brother of Eowyn and heir to the throne of Rohan. He is loyal to his uncle, the king, even though he mistrusts the adviser Wormtongue. Faramir, human, as performed by David Wenham. The brother of the slain Boromir, Faramir’s respect for Gandalf prompts him to join Aragorn and the remainder of the fellowship on the quest to destroy the ring."
"Dec 20, 2002",POSITIVE,The cast remains excellent.
"Dec 19, 2002",POSITIVE,"Could use a little more humanity, but it never lacks in eye-popping visuals."
"Dec 19, 2002",POSITIVE," I guess the important preface is that I go into these films having never read the Lord of the Rings. When I first became aware of the books at around 12 yrs old, I figured I had enough geeky pursuits that defined my personality without adding being a Lord of the Rings fan on top if it. Call it pre-teen ""geek shame"". I mean, it was bad enough I could spend countless hours debating pre and post Frank Miller Daredevil comics and enjoyed painting minitures, without adding ""Lord of the Rings Fan"" to ""Star Trek Fan"" and ""Doctor Who Fan"" on my resume. Somehow, even though I was tempted, the years passed by and I never picked up the books. I'll get around to it someday but only after I have seen the films. Anyway, now that that is out of the way...  When we last left the Fellowship, entrusted with the mighty task of taking the evil one ring into the heart of Mordor to destroy it in the fires where it was created, noble hobbits Frodo and Sam ventured into Sauron's Mordor alone, while warriors Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas track captured hobbits Merry and Pippin, who are being taken to Sauron's servant Saruman.  Essentially Two Towers is split into three stories: Frodo and Sam traveling through Mordor, aided in the rough journey when they encounter Gollum, who is both a source of danger because of his demented, murderous desire for the ring and a source of pity because of his duality, still retaining some of the Hobbitlike creature, Smeagol, he once was, now turned into a pathetic shadow of his former self and only wanting to serve and help the two. Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin barely escape Sarumon's Uruk-Hai, encounter Treebeard, and try to convince him and his race, The Ents, to attack Sarumon's lair in Isengard. And finally, Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, and a back from the dead Gandalf aide the kingdom of Rohan, which has been left in ruin due to Saruman's meddling, poisoning, possessing the mind of the king, and using a court insider, Wormtongue, to manipulate him. The evil forces each attack the land of men. Saruman sends a massive army to destroy Rohan, which culminates in a battle at Helms Deep. Sauron has whittled away at the kingdom of Rohan, where Frodo, Sam, and Gollum, find themselves captured and conflicted on how they can continue with the responsibility of destroying the ring.   Well, the first thing that must be said, is that Two Towers reconfirms what Fellowship hinted at, the fact that Peter Jackson's (and Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Andrew Lesnie, Richard Taylor, Weta, and the rest of the dedicated crew) adaptation of Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the great achievements in Fantasy cinema. Unless there is some awesome misstep with the third film, The Return of the King, it is hard to imagine these films not ranking as an absolute crowd pleasing, imaginative, adventure classics. Like all great epics, I never felt its three hour running time was tedious, as a matter of fact, I could have done with even more.  Where Fellowship was about defining characters and creating an arc to get the story going, Two Towers  is almost  pure situation, pure action. Battles. Capture. Tension.  A much larger scale, with more creatures, armies,  and doom. More fx, less internal musing. The quiet moments are few and far between, like King Théoden mourning the loss of his son, Aragorn dreaming of Arwen, but overall the film is kept at a fever pitch of often bleak action scenes and little grim moments.   While it is exciting, Two Towers lacks the emotional intimacy of the first film. And, for this non-fan of the books, Tolkien's story when wedged into a film is still a bit unwieldy. There are bits of character depth and fantasy logic that fans of the book no doubt have sorted out but left me confused and scratching my head. The established characters get some growth.   Frodo is being sickly pressured by the ring, finding a kinship with Gollum, while  Sam is fretting over both and trying to remain the grounded one. Aragorn re-embraces the kingdom of men and his role as a leader among them yet is still consumed by his love for the elf maiden Arwen.  Gandalf becomes a supporting player, along with Legolas, the comic relief Gimli, and the rest. While there are new characters, Wormtongue, Éowyn, Treebeard, King Théoden, Faramir, and Eomer, they are simple, relegated to supporting parts that add spice to the story but, for this non-book fan, are a bit lacking in definition. With so much action going on (some of it seemingly unnecessary, like Aragorn's brief disappearance) and the addition of new characters almost diluting what was already a sufficiently epic cast, I didn't feel it click like the first film.   While Towers excited me with its action, the emphasis on action thrills made the film lack some emotional focus. For me,  Towers lacked the emotional punch and character arc that made the Fellowship (although just a beginning) have a sense of completion. Sure, both films feature final halves that are all about adventure, diving into one dire situation into the next, but I didn't get the same sense of completion Fellowship had, the characters going through a significant metamorphosis. The final  half of Towers is like one long sprint, and by the end, there is no finish line in sight. But, this is after all only the middle, so the third film should help remedy this quibble, because then we will see just what part the new characters play and how the frenetic action of Towers affects the final outcome.    There is so much to say in terms of impressive moments. But, I'll just narrow my comments to what I thought was the most entertaining part of the film- Gollum/Smeagol... Gollum is without a doubt one of the most memorable and impressive characters/tricks/fx I have ever seen. Here is an artificial creation with a jaw-dropping range of engaging emotion and depth, at once pitiful, psychotic, untrustworthy, comic, deadly, and haunted. I just could not believe it. This poor little William Hickeyish guy commands the screen. There are some rumbles of possibly  attempting to get the WETA crew, who digitized him, and Andy Serkis, who stood in for him and did the voice, Oscar nods for Best Supporting Actor. That is a big puzzler. While I think they may be deserving, I have my doubts based on the audiences reaction where I saw it. While Gollum has some comic moments, perhaps because of the  voice, the look, the overall strangeness, even in his dramatic moments much of the audience at my theater were laughing at him. So, just based on that, I'll assume maybe the world isn't ready to embrace a digital creation as an award-worthy performer. It is still boggles my mind that in a film featuring actors I've followed over the years, Viggo Mortensen, Brad Douriff, and Christopher Lee, the performance I found most striking is from a creation that is completely intangible.  Finally, I'll say that my favorite moment was a minor one. It was a bit that, I assume,  really showed more Peter Jackson than Tolkien. When Pippin an Merry are captured by the Uruk-Hai, the goblin/orc lot begin debating why they cant eat them. The leader reminds them that Sarumon wants them alive so they cant be killed. The hobbits happiness over this is nixed when one of the orcs suggest they just eat their legs. It is a blackly comic/frightening moment that remind me of Bad Taste, PJ's first film, which I picked up blind off the ""new release"" rack at a little video store, and it started my love for the man as a director/writer. I've been following him ever since, and next year, once again, I'll be there opening day for the final installment of the Rings Trilogy. When we last left the Fellowship, entrusted with the mighty task of taking the evil one ring into the heart of Mordor to destroy it in the fires where it was created, noble hobbits Frodo and Sam ventured into Sauron's Mordor alone, while warriors Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas track captured hobbits Merry and Pippin, who are being taken to Sauron's servant Saruman.

Well, the first thing that must be said, is that Two Towers reconfirms what Fellowship hinted at, the fact that Peter Jackson's (and Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Andrew Lesnie, Richard Taylor, Weta, and the rest of the dedicated crew) adaptation of Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the great achievements in Fantasy cinema. Unless there is some awesome misstep with the third film, The Return of the King, it is hard to imagine these films not ranking as an absolute crowd pleasing, imaginative, adventure classics. Like all great epics, I never felt its three hour running time was tedious, as a matter of fact, I could have done with even more.  Where Fellowship was about defining characters and creating an arc to get the story going, Two Towers  is almost  pure situation, pure action. Battles. Capture. Tension.  A much larger scale, with more creatures, armies,  and doom. More fx, less internal musing. The quiet moments are few and far between, like King Théoden mourning the loss of his son, Aragorn dreaming of Arwen, but overall the film is kept at a fever pitch of often bleak action scenes and little grim moments.   While it is exciting, Two Towers lacks the emotional intimacy of the first film. And, for this non-fan of the books, Tolkien's story when wedged into a film is still a bit unwieldy. There are bits of character depth and fantasy logic that fans of the book no doubt have sorted out but left me confused and scratching my head. The established characters get some growth.   Frodo is being sickly pressured by the ring, finding a kinship with Gollum, while  Sam is fretting over both and trying to remain the grounded one. Aragorn re-embraces the kingdom of men and his role as a leader among them yet is still consumed by his love for the elf maiden Arwen.  Gandalf becomes a supporting player, along with Legolas, the comic relief Gimli, and the rest. While there are new characters, Wormtongue, Éowyn, Treebeard, King Théoden, Faramir, and Eomer, they are simple, relegated to supporting parts that add spice to the story but, for this non-book fan, are a bit lacking in definition. With so much action going on (some of it seemingly unnecessary, like Aragorn's brief disappearance) and the addition of new characters almost diluting what was already a sufficiently epic cast, I didn't feel it click like the first film.   While Towers excited me with its action, the emphasis on action thrills made the film lack some emotional focus. For me,  Towers lacked the emotional punch and character arc that made the Fellowship (although just a beginning) have a sense of completion. Sure, both films feature final halves that are all about adventure, diving into one dire situation into the next, but I didn't get the same sense of completion Fellowship had, the characters going through a significant metamorphosis. The final  half of Towers is like one long sprint, and by the end, there is no finish line in sight. But, this is after all only the middle, so the third film should help remedy this quibble, because then we will see just what part the new characters play and how the frenetic action of Towers affects the final outcome.    There is so much to say in terms of impressive moments. But, I'll just narrow my comments to what I thought was the most entertaining part of the film- Gollum/Smeagol... Gollum is without a doubt one of the most memorable and impressive characters/tricks/fx I have ever seen. Here is an artificial creation with a jaw-dropping range of engaging emotion and depth, at once pitiful, psychotic, untrustworthy, comic, deadly, and haunted. I just could not believe it. This poor little William Hickeyish guy commands the screen. There are some rumbles of possibly  attempting to get the WETA crew, who digitized him, and Andy Serkis, who stood in for him and did the voice, Oscar nods for Best Supporting Actor. That is a big puzzler. While I think they may be deserving, I have my doubts based on the audiences reaction where I saw it. While Gollum has some comic moments, perhaps because of the  voice, the look, the overall strangeness, even in his dramatic moments much of the audience at my theater were laughing at him. So, just based on that, I'll assume maybe the world isn't ready to embrace a digital creation as an award-worthy performer. It is still boggles my mind that in a film featuring actors I've followed over the years, Viggo Mortensen, Brad Douriff, and Christopher Lee, the performance I found most striking is from a creation that is completely intangible.  Finally, I'll say that my favorite moment was a minor one. It was a bit that, I assume,  really showed more Peter Jackson than Tolkien. When Pippin an Merry are captured by the Uruk-Hai, the goblin/orc lot begin debating why they cant eat them. The leader reminds them that Sarumon wants them alive so they cant be killed. The hobbits happiness over this is nixed when one of the orcs suggest they just eat their legs. It is a blackly comic/frightening moment that remind me of Bad Taste, PJ's first film, which I picked up blind off the ""new release"" rack at a little video store, and it started my love for the man as a director/writer. I've been following him ever since, and next year, once again, I'll be there opening day for the final installment of the Rings Trilogy. Essentially Two Towers is split into three stories: Frodo and Sam traveling through Mordor, aided in the rough journey when they encounter Gollum, who is both a source of danger because of his demented, murderous desire for the ring and a source of pity because of his duality, still retaining some of the Hobbitlike creature, Smeagol, he once was, now turned into a pathetic shadow of his former self and only wanting to serve and help the two. Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin barely escape Sarumon's Uruk-Hai, encounter Treebeard, and try to convince him and his race, The Ents, to attack Sarumon's lair in Isengard. And finally, Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, and a back from the dead Gandalf aide the kingdom of Rohan, which has been left in ruin due to Saruman's meddling, poisoning, possessing the mind of the king, and using a court insider, Wormtongue, to manipulate him. The evil forces each attack the land of men. Saruman sends a massive army to destroy Rohan, which culminates in a battle at Helms Deep. Sauron has whittled away at the kingdom of Rohan, where Frodo, Sam, and Gollum, find themselves captured and conflicted on how they can continue with the responsibility of destroying the ring.   Well, the first thing that must be said, is that Two Towers reconfirms what Fellowship hinted at, the fact that Peter Jackson's (and Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Andrew Lesnie, Richard Taylor, Weta, and the rest of the dedicated crew) adaptation of Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the great achievements in Fantasy cinema. Unless there is some awesome misstep with the third film, The Return of the King, it is hard to imagine these films not ranking as an absolute crowd pleasing, imaginative, adventure classics.

Finally, I'll say that my favorite moment was a minor one. It was a bit that, I assume,  really showed more Peter Jackson than Tolkien. When Pippin an Merry are captured by the Uruk-Hai, the goblin/orc lot begin debating why they cant eat them. The leader reminds them that Sarumon wants them alive so they cant be killed. The hobbits happiness over this is nixed when one of the orcs suggest they just eat their legs. It is a blackly comic/frightening moment that remind me of Bad Taste, PJ's first film, which I picked up blind off the ""new release"" rack at a little video store, and it started my love for the man as a director/writer. I've been following him ever since, and next year, once again, I'll be there opening day for the final installment of the Rings Trilogy. Finally, I'll say that my favorite moment was a minor one.

"Dec 19, 2002",POSITIVE," The justices will hear arguments Monday in a Grants Pass, Ore., case on whether ticketing people who live on the streets is ""cruel and unusual"" and violates the Eighth Amendment. Terry Anderson, the globe-trotting Associated Press correspondent who became one of America’s longest-held hostages after he was snatched from a street in war-torn Lebanon in 1985 and held for nearly seven years, has died at 76.  After his release, he returned to a hero’s welcome at AP’s New York headquarters. Ataff members at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, a public hospital run by the county, told investigators that Dr. Louis Kwong sometimes looked under the surgical covers of anesthetized Black males and discussed the ""genitals of the day.""

"Dec 19, 2002",POSITIVE," ""The battle between Good and Evil always makes a great movie,"" said the woman sitting in front of me right before Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers started. Although I didn’t talk with her after the film, I’m fairly certain she got her money’s worth. An abundance of ""good,"" ""evil,"" and ""battles"" fills the screen for almost three hours during Peter Jackson's second movie based on J.R.R. Tokien’s mythological classic. And, like The Fellowship of the Ring, awesome creatures and breathtaking scenery add to the spectacle before us. Filmed in New Zealand, The Two Towers showcases snow-capped mountains, sparkling lakes, and immense forests. It’s almost enough to persuade one to move there – at least until weird creatures start making their appearance. Enormous flying dragons, hyena/bear-like animals with VERY sharp teeth, huge talking trees, and a creepy little man called Gollum (who looks like Peter Lorre and Mia Farrow’s love child) are some of the unusual creatures featured in this most cinematic of epic adventures. ""Evil"" is easy to spot in The Two Towers, at least by everyone except Gollum, who struggles with a dual personality, and Treebeard, a talking tree who refuses to take sides at first because ""No one is on my side."" Saruman (Christoper Lee), a corrupt wizard under control of the dark lord Sauron, continues to personify evil in this part of the trilogy. But his accomplice, Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif) is no slouch either when it comes to doing bad things. By creating a vast Uruk-hai army, these two plan to destroy Man and Middle-earth.  And they almost succeed – as depicted in one of the most action-packed battle scenes ever filmed. However, with so much maiming and killing going on, I’m surprised, but not disappointed, at the lack of specific violence and bloodshed shown on screen (perhaps to maintain a ""PG-13"" rating?). Involving and exciting, this lengthy sequence matches Black Hawk Down for its you-are-there feeling.  I’m also pleased that The Two Towers moves along at a faster pace than Fellowship of the Ring, probably because it’s much less talky. My only criticism? More humor is needed. Although Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys Davies) says a couple of funny things, that’s not enough for me. On second thought, is there anything very amusing about the battle between Good and Evil? In the immortal words of Emily Littela (Gilda Radner’s famous ""SNL"" character), ""Never mind."""
"Dec 19, 2002",NEUTRAL,"Maybe The Two Towers will stand as a more respectable and meaningful bridge between the crucial first and last entries. On its own, however, it is a crushing disappointment of ill-advised missteps and misplaced opportunities."

Whether you're relocating a small business or a large corporation, understanding the nuances of commercial moves is crucial. This comprehensive guide explores the intricacies of commercial moving services and provides insights to ensure a smooth transition for your business. Commercial moving differs significantly from residential moving. It involves the relocation of sensitive equipment, important documents, and large pieces of furniture, all while minimizing downtime and disruption to business operations. Commercial moving companies specialize in these types of moves, equipped with the right tools and expertise to handle the unique challenges that come with moving a business. The key to a successful office move lies in thorough planning. Start by creating a detailed moving plan that outlines every aspect of the move, including timelines, budgets, and specific responsibilities. Early planning helps in identifying potential challenges and provides ample time to address them. Involving employees in the planning process can also help in easing the transition. Selecting the right commercial moving company is critical. Look for commercial moving companies with experience in handling office moves similar to yours. Check their credentials, insurance policies, and customer reviews. A good commercial moving company will offer a range of services tailored to your needs and provide a detailed plan to ensure a seamless move. Minimizing downtime is a top priority during commercial moves. To achieve this, consider moving in stages or outside of regular business hours. Communicate with your commercial moving services provider about your business needs to develop a strategy that minimizes impact on operations. Keeping employees informed and involved is also key to a smooth transition. Effective organization is essential for a successful move. Labeling boxes, creating detailed inventories, and having a clear layout plan for the new office can streamline the moving process. Commercial moving companies often provide services such as packing, unpacking, and setting up equipment, which can be invaluable in ensuring an organized move. Once the move is complete, the focus shifts to setting up your new office for success. This involves more than just unpacking; it's about creating a functional and comfortable workspace. Work with your commercial moving services to ensure that everything is set up according to plan. Take this opportunity to reevaluate your office layout and make improvements that can enhance workflow and productivity. Relocating an office is a significant undertaking, but with the right commercial moving company, it can be a smooth and efficient process. By understanding the essentials of commercial moves, planning effectively, and choosing the right commercial moving services, you can ensure a seamless transition to your new office space. Remember, a successful move is not just about transporting items from one place to another; it's about ensuring the continuity and growth of your business in a new environment.

The dynamism of the business world requires not just metaphorical movement but, at times, literal ones too. The challenges of business relocations are many, from logistical nightmares to operational downtimes. Here's where full service commercial moving companies can be your savior.  Relocating a business isn't merely about shifting items from one location to another. It's a complex task, involving planning, coordination, and ensuring minimal disruption to the daily workings of the company. Amidst these complexities, moving companies, especially those offering full-service packages, have emerged as crucial partners for businesses on the move. Today's businesses relocate for myriad reasons. It could be to tap into new markets, to cater to expansion needs, or even downsizing in some cases. But every move brings with it a set of unique challenges. While moving companies have been long-standing partners in this journey, the evolving demands of businesses now require movers who can provide a more holistic solution. So, what sets full service commercial moving companies apart? They go beyond the traditional packing and transportation. They delve deep into managing every minor aspect, from logistics to ensuring the new setup mirrors the ethos of the business. In essence, these movers act as an extended arm, ensuring businesses continue to function seamlessly even in transit.

As the business landscape gets more competitive, the number of moving companies vying for attention has increased. It's imperative for businesses to do their due diligence. Look for movers with a solid track record, solicit reviews, and perhaps most importantly, ensure their services align with the specific needs of the business. A move isn't just about assets; it's about people too. Ensuring that the team is comfortable, well-informed, and prepared for the move is as crucial as the physical relocation. A smooth transition for employees often translates to quicker business resumption. Technology is rapidly changing the way we do business, and this extends to relocations too.

A relocation decision often stems from growth, a need for a more strategic location, or operational requirements. Before jumping into the move, critically evaluate the reasons. Understand the long-term benefits, and weigh them against the short-term disruptions. One of the critical decisions in a commercial move is selecting the right moving service. Not all commercial movers are created equal. Look for full service commercial movers companies that offer comprehensive solutions - from packing to set-up. Their experience, reviews, and capability to handle moves of your scale should guide your choice. This stage is all about organization. Establish clear timelines, delegate responsibilities, and set milestones. Collaboration with your chosen commercial moving services ensures that both parties are aligned on priorities and schedules. Efficiency is key. Every piece of equipment, every desk, and every file needs to be accounted for. Commercial movers often provide specialized inventory systems to track assets, ensuring that nothing goes amiss during the move. Engage department heads and communicate clearly with staff about the move. Their cooperation is vital. After all, they’re familiar with their workspaces and can aid in the efficient packing and unpacking of their areas. Full service commercial movers companies often provide guidelines and checklists to assist in this internal coordination. Commercial moves can involve complex equipment, from IT servers to large machinery. Handling these requires expertise. Commercial moving services are equipped with the necessary tools and knowledge to transport such items safely. Once the move is underway, attention shifts to setting up the new space. Think about optimal space utilization, ensuring that the new layout supports efficient operations. Expert commercial movers can offer insights based on their experience with other businesses, ensuring your new space is both functional and welcoming. After the move, there's an adjustment period. Solicit feedback from staff, address any issues promptly, and celebrate the successful move. Remember, the goal isn’t just to relocate but to improve. If there are any hiccups, full service commercial movers companies often provide post-move support to help resolve them. Mastering a commercial move is about meticulous planning, clear communication, and the right partnerships. With the support of professional commercial movers and a comprehensive approach, businesses can ensure their relocation is more than just a move—it's a step forward.

Regardless of the reasons behind the move, the process invariably presents its set of challenges.

Your budget should account for moving services, packing supplies, travel expenses, and potential additional costs such as insurance and storage. Consider setting up a dedicated moving fund to manage these expenses. A well-planned budget can provide you with peace of mind during this transition period. There are two primary options when it comes to the actual moving process: hiring professional moving companies or opting for a DIY move. Professional movers can simplify the moving process significantly. However, costs can be high, so it's important to obtain and compare quotes from several moving companies. A DIY move can be a more cost-effective option, especially for smaller, local moves. Weigh the pros and cons of both options before making a decision. Smart packing begins with a thorough decluttering. The fewer items you have, the less you'll spend on moving them. Sell, donate, or recycle items you no longer need. Then, when it comes to packing, consider sourcing free or inexpensive packing materials. Many local moving companies sell used boxes at a discounted price, or you might collect boxes from local businesses. Timing your move can significantly impact costs. If possible, try to move during the off-peak season (usually winter), as moving companies often offer lower rates during these times. Additionally, remember to check for available discounts or deals from moving companies. Protecting your belongings with appropriate insurance can also prevent unexpected costs from damages or losses. Upon arrival, setting up your new home can be managed cost-effectively too. When installing utilities, compare service providers for the best rates. When it comes to furnishing, second-hand stores or online marketplaces can offer excellent deals. Remember, investing in regular home maintenance can prevent expensive repairs down the line. Relocating doesn't have to break the bank. By understanding moving costs, planning a comprehensive budget, making smart decisions about moving services and packing, and setting up your new home economically, significant savings can be achieved. Above all, remember that the secret to a budget-friendly move is in strategic planning, not cutting corners. With the right approach and reliable local moving companies supporting your move, this transition can be both financially manageable and exciting. As a small business owner, managing your payroll system is one of the critical functions that ensure the smooth operation of your business. A payroll service is a third-party company that automates all payroll-related tasks, taking the burden off your shoulders. The question is, should small businesses invest in payroll services? This article delves into this topic in depth. Payroll services are specialized firms designed to handle multiple aspects of your employee payroll. These services are responsible for calculating employee wages, deducting appropriate taxes, managing benefits, garnishments, filing necessary tax documents, and ensuring the issuance of direct deposits or paychecks.  There are different types of payroll services available. Full-service payroll companies provide a comprehensive package, including all necessary functions, while online payroll services offer convenient web-based solutions. Lastly, payroll software allows small businesses to manage payroll tasks in-house with more ease and efficiency. When you think about the time involved in managing your payroll system, the argument for outsourcing to a payroll service becomes more compelling. As a small business owner, your time is a precious commodity. A payroll service can take over these duties, freeing you up to focus on the core business operations. From a financial standpoint, outsourcing can be more cost-effective than you might imagine. If you factor in the hours spent on payroll tasks, plus the potential costs of mistakes and penalties from incorrect filings, hiring a professional payroll service could be a worthwhile investment. One of the significant challenges with handling employee payroll is the potential for mistakes. Even small errors can result in hefty penalties. A payroll service has expertise in this area and can help you avoid costly mistakes. Compliance with tax laws is another area where payroll services shine. Keeping up-to-date with changing regulations can be a full-time job in itself. Payroll services have the resources to stay current with these laws, ensuring your business remains compliant. Moreover, a professional payroll service can provide simplified employee management. They can handle everything from new hires to terminations, benefits administration, and even employee self-service portals. When it comes to choosing a payroll service, you'll first need to assess your business needs. Do you need a full-service option, or would an online service or software meet your needs?  Features to consider include automatic payroll runs, multiple payment options, tax filing services, and integrations with existing systems. Balancing cost and quality is also crucial. While you don't want to overpay, it's essential to ensure the service you choose can accurately and efficiently handle your employee payroll. Several small businesses have reaped the benefits of hiring a payroll service. For example, a small retail store owner managed to cut down on operational hours significantly by outsourcing their payroll, allowing them more time to focus on business growth. On the flip side, businesses that chose to handle payroll tasks internally often faced penalties for incorrect tax filings and employee dissatisfaction due to payroll errors. In conclusion, hiring a payroll service can bring significant benefits to a small business. From saving time to reducing costs, ensuring compliance with tax laws, avoiding mistakes and penalties, and simplifying employee management, the advantages are substantial. As a small business owner, your focus should be on growing your business. If managing your payroll system is detracting from that, it may be time to consider investing in professional payroll services. Remember, the right payroll service is not an expense but an investment towards your business's growth and success. When DIY local moves end up being the best option but a little help with the boxes is necessary, many local moving companies provide truck loading and unloading services to take care of the most difficult part. Hiring local moving services to handle the heavy work can end up being the perfect compromise for those with access to their own or a rental truck but simply do not have the ability or desire to load and unload it.  Though many people find that local moves done on a DIY basis are their best way to move inexpensively, it is important to also be realistic about what is actually involved in this process. Hiring a local moving service that offers truck loading services is an affordable option for DIY movers who do not have help available, or simply cannot do all that lifting on their own!"

The dynamism of the business world requires not just metaphorical movement but, at times, literal ones too. The challenges of business relocations are many, from logistical nightmares to operational downtimes. Here's where full service commercial moving companies can be your savior.  Relocating a business isn't merely about shifting items from one location to another. It's a complex task, involving planning, coordination, and ensuring minimal disruption to the daily workings of the company. Amidst these complexities, moving companies, especially those offering full-service packages, have emerged as crucial partners for businesses on the move. Today's businesses relocate for myriad reasons. It could be to tap into new markets, to cater to expansion needs, or even downsizing in some cases. But every move brings with it a set of unique challenges. While moving companies have been long-standing partners in this journey, the evolving demands of businesses now require movers who can provide a more holistic solution. So, what sets full service commercial moving companies apart? They go beyond the traditional packing and transportation. They delve deep into managing every minor aspect, from logistics to ensuring the new setup mirrors the ethos of the business. In essence, these movers act as an extended arm, ensuring businesses continue to function seamlessly even in transit. The decision to opt for a full-service move can be one of the best a business makes. The expertise that full service commercial moving companies bring to the table is unparalleled. The safety standards they adhere to ensure assets, both delicate and bulky, are transported without a scratch. Their services provide unmatched convenience, allowing businesses to focus on what they do best, while the movers handle the rest. And let's not forget the time and potential revenue saved when the move is efficient and quick. When considering a business relocation, it's vital to weigh the initial outlay against the long-term benefits. While the upfront costs of hiring a full-service mover might seem high, the long-term gains, both in terms of operational efficiency and reduced downtime, often justify the investment. As the business landscape gets more competitive, the number of moving companies vying for attention has increased. It's imperative for businesses to do their due diligence. Look for movers with a solid track record, solicit reviews, and perhaps most importantly, ensure their services align with the specific needs of the business. A move isn't just about assets; it's about people too. Ensuring that the team is comfortable, well-informed, and prepared for the move is as crucial as the physical relocation. A smooth transition for employees often translates to quicker business resumption. Technology is rapidly changing the way we do business, and this extends to relocations too. The best full service commercial moving companies are leveraging technology to offer real-time updates, use advanced logistics solutions, and ensure moves are as efficient as they can be. In the fast-paced world of business, a move can signify growth, change, or a strategic shift. To ensure this transition is as smooth as possible, partnering with full service commercial moving companies can be the key.

From ensuring that every asset is accounted for to managing the logistics, the process can quickly become overwhelming. But with the right planning and support from professional commercial moving services, your business can experience a seamless transition. Here’s your comprehensive guide to mastering commercial moves. A commercial move isn't just about changing addresses. It’s a pivotal moment that can impact operations, staff morale, and business continuity. Choosing adept commercial movers can be the difference between a smooth transition and a logistical nightmare. A relocation decision often stems from growth, a need for a more strategic location, or operational requirements. Before jumping into the move, critically evaluate the reasons. Understand the long-term benefits, and weigh them against the short-term disruptions. One of the critical decisions in a commercial move is selecting the right moving service. Not all commercial movers are created equal. Look for full service commercial movers companies that offer comprehensive solutions - from packing to set-up. Their experience, reviews, and capability to handle moves of your scale should guide your choice. This stage is all about organization. Establish clear timelines, delegate responsibilities, and set milestones. Collaboration with your chosen commercial moving services ensures that both parties are aligned on priorities and schedules. Efficiency is key. Every piece of equipment, every desk, and every file needs to be accounted for. Commercial movers often provide specialized inventory systems to track assets, ensuring that nothing goes amiss during the move. Engage department heads and communicate clearly with staff about the move. Their cooperation is vital. After all, they’re familiar with their workspaces and can aid in the efficient packing and unpacking of their areas. Full service commercial movers companies often provide guidelines and checklists to assist in this internal coordination. Commercial moves can involve complex equipment, from IT servers to large machinery. Handling these requires expertise. Commercial moving services are equipped with the necessary tools and knowledge to transport such items safely. Once the move is underway, attention shifts to setting up the new space. Think about optimal space utilization, ensuring that the new layout supports efficient operations. Expert commercial movers can offer insights based on their experience with other businesses, ensuring your new space is both functional and welcoming. After the move, there's an adjustment period. Solicit feedback from staff, address any issues promptly, and celebrate the successful move. Remember, the goal isn’t just to relocate but to improve. If there are any hiccups, full service commercial movers companies often provide post-move support to help resolve them. Mastering a commercial move is about meticulous planning, clear communication, and the right partnerships. With the support of professional commercial movers and a comprehensive approach, businesses can ensure their relocation is more than just a move—it's a step forward. Whether you're upsizing, optimizing, or reshaping, remember that every move carries the promise of growth. By partnering with the right commercial moving services, that promise becomes a guaranteed success. Relocating to a new place can be a whirlwind of emotions—excitement, apprehension, nostalgia, and anticipation. Regardless of the reasons behind the move, the process invariably presents its set of challenges. While many brave the journey independently, an increasing number of individuals are relying on moving companies to simplify the ordeal. In particular, home moving companies and residential movers have transformed the relocation landscape, offering specialized services tailored to personal moves. Here’s a guide to help you navigate your move with ease. In conclusion, moving is more than just a physical transition—it's an emotional and psychological journey. While it presents its challenges, partnering with trusted home moving companies or residential movers can alleviate many of the burdens associated with relocating. As you embark on this new chapter, remember that every box unpacked and every picture hung is a step closer to making the new place feel like home. Happy moving! Choosing to outsource employee payroll duties to an accounting firm or other payroll system is a good decision for small businesses looking to make doing the payroll easier. Using a payroll system, employers no longer need to struggle with tax rules, data recording, and other frustrating tasks that take time away from them actually doing business. As easy as all of this can be, many business owners have questions about how the process works when outsourcing employee payroll to a payroll service. Relocating to a new home symbolizes fresh starts and exciting opportunities. But it's no secret - moving can be stressful, and costs can quickly add up. Understanding the financial implications and planning strategically can help you navigate this process without breaking the bank. This guide is designed to provide practical, budget-friendly tips for your next move. The first step to a budget-friendly move is understanding potential costs. These can vary significantly based on factors such as distance, the size of your household, and the type of move. Local moving companies typically charge per hour, while long-distance moving costs are usually calculated based on weight and mileage. Additional expenses may include packing materials, insurance, and potential storage fees. Understanding these costs upfront allows you to plan your budget more accurately. Once you've estimated your relocation costs, creating a comprehensive moving budget is crucial. Your budget should account for moving services, packing supplies, travel expenses, and potential additional costs such as insurance and storage. Consider setting up a dedicated moving fund to manage these expenses. A well-planned budget can provide you with peace of mind during this transition period. There are two primary options when it comes to the actual moving process: hiring professional moving companies or opting for a DIY move. Professional movers can simplify the moving process significantly. However, costs can be high, so it's important to obtain and compare quotes from several moving companies.

"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,"""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is majestic in its splendor."
"Dec 18, 2002",NEGATIVE,"The wait is over, and it was worth it."
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,"   DARKER, faster and more violent than the magnificent first installment of Peter Jackson’s screen realization of “The Lord of the Rings,” “The Two Towers” is at least its equal in visual and special effects magic.   And the sequel’s battle scenes – especially the climactic assault on the Helm’s Deep fortress by the armies of darkness – easily put those of the “Star Wars” series to shame.   But this fidelity – broken only by the emphasis on the female elves played by Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler, and the turning of Faramir of Gondor (David Wenham) into a quasi-villain – is also at the root of the film’s occasional stiffness.   Like the first movie, “The Two Towers” is earnest almost to the point of hilarity. There are many, many moments when the heroes arrive somewhere they’ve never been before, and one of them says portentously, “This is the Valley of Gorgonzola” or something like that, before a companion looks off in another direction and says something on the order of, “I sense evil here.”   And unless you know the book well, you may need a guidebook to identify places and characters like Isengard and Sauron (see yesterday’s Post). It doesn’t help the possible confusion that some characters inexplicably drop in and out of “Elvish” (with subtitles in English).   At the beginning of “The Two Towers,” the Fellowship of the Ring has been split into three groups. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are still making their way to Mordor to destroy the magical One Ring (which hangs increasingly heavily around Frodo’s neck).   Meanwhile (the film is a succession of “meanwhiles”), human warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson), Gimli the dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) and the blond elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom) are making their way over the mountains in pursuit of the band of Uruk-hai super-Orcs that have captured Frodo’s hobbit friends (Group No. 3) Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd).   While the trio led by Aragorn enter the sad kingdom of Rohan, where King Theoden (Bernard Hill from “Titanic”) has been bewitched by his councilor Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), Frodo and Sam capture Gollum, the strange creature that has been following them. Though Sam doesn’t trust Gollum at all, they get him to act as their guide to Mordor.   The filmmakers have actually made him more compelling here than in the book, fleshing out the internal conflict between his ring-inspired evil and his vestigial good self.   It’s a shame the City of Rohan looks like a tiny hamlet. And there’s something Monty Pythonesque in the way Princess Eowyn’s (Miranda Otto) royalness is conveyed by her being the only person in Rohan with clean hair.   Some have seen parallels with “the war on terror,” and the franchise does seem to have captured something of the spirit of the age with its coalition-building, berobed bad-guys, etc.   But “Towers” is – even more explicitly than the novel or the first episode – an attack on the industrialization Tolkien thought was destroying the spirit of pre-war rural England. In any case, it’s an amazing feat of imagination."
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,"Although Jackson is doubtless reserving the darkest hours for The Return of the King, we long for a greater sense of urgency in the here and now of The Two Towers."
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,"The first two hours are a tiny bit tedious, but nonetheless this movie is second only to part 1 of the trilogy."
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,"For those of us who thought the first film was at its best when reveling in the little details of life in Middle-earth and examining the relationships between its characters, The Two Towers is a letdown."
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,What's really scary is it will likely pale by comparison to the ultimate showdown in next year's final chapter.
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,"Technically, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is another towering achievement for New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson."
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE," Written by Philippa Boyens, Peter Jackson, Stephen Sinclair & Frances Walsh, based on the novel by J.R.R. Tolkien
Directed by Peter Jackson
Starring Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom
My Advice: Matinee.
The second installment in the adaptation of Tolkien's trilogy has arrived--and everybody is in deep orc manure.  
Frodo and Sam (Wood and Astin) are still on their way to Mordor, being stalked by the lovable, huggable Gollum (voiced
by Andy Serkis).  Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli (Mortensen, Bloom and John Rhys-Davies) are still on the track of the other
two hobbits, Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd), who got snatched up by the Uruk--which are, as you might
recall, ostensibly orcs on PCP.  All of this to try and stop Saruman (Christopher Lee) from tag-teaming with Sauron to 
kick the ass of Middle Earth.

Bottom line: this is the most visually stunning film you will see this year.  Or probably until the third film comes out
the end of next year.  The new ""steeds"" of the Nazgul are pure sleek evil with wings, the armies of Saruman's White Hand
(too bad it wasn't a red one, then Nick Cave could have recorded the song for the closing credits) beggar description,
and Helms Deep is as badass as you could wish for.  

There are problems, though.  This film, as I understand it, was written and produced as if it were the middle part of
a much longer nine hour film--i.e., the entire trilogy.  The problem is not, as many have pointed out, that nothing gets 
started and nothing
gets resolved...because, really, that's bullshit and a copout.  If you don't call the climax of Helms Deep a resolution,
then you have some serious narrative issues to work out on your own.  The trouble is--it's just the middle.  It's as if
Jackson and company felt that, with the Mondo Edition DVD having come out just shortly before, there was no need to do
anything but pickup where the first film left off.  Or, you've just gotten back from an intermission from seeing part
one.  As a result, there's a good half-hour before this film gets
started.  And let's face it, it's a separate film from the other two--it should have some way of standing on its own.  I
kept expecting Cate Blanchett to give me a nice ten minute summary of What Has Come Before--then you could launch into
the wastes of Mordor and so forth.  But no, it just kind of...begins and then lumbers on before finally waking up and getting
anything done--a lot like me in the morning.

I wish I could say that was the extent of this film's drawbacks.  But there are some more, and they're so patently obvious
and easy to fix that they're maddening.  There are flashbacks to the continuity of the first film involving the relationship
with Arwen (Liv Tyler) and Aragorn that completely change how the audience views Elrond (Hugo
Weaving) and his daughter, and Aragorn and his elvin love.  It almost feels like they decided to make a change between
the release of the first film and this one--but how can you retcon when you did the films all at once?  Very confusing.

Gimli's character is played for laughs--perpetually.  Rather than being a blustering warrior who talks a lot but kicks
ass when necessary (as in the first film), he's here reduced to being just a bluster--who gets maybe one occasion to do 
any serious blade-wielding.
His constant humor during Helms Deep is unnecessary--it's a lot like C-3PO in the final battle of Attack 
of the Clones: distracting as all hell and a huge tension breaker.

Cate Blanchett's narration as Galadriel--you remember, the one I was expecting at the beginning of the film--seems to 
kick off in the middle instead, and it's hard to tell if it's really narration or some kind of bizarre admonishment to
Elrond.  And Samwise has a speech towards the end that is so incredibly, terribly on the nose--that it's painful.

Was the first film devoid of cheese?  No.  It was just so expertly balanced with action, humor, tension, etc. etc. that
you didn't care.  It all flowed and flowed well.  This time around, the film is just a big gorgeous, mind-blowing,
breath-taking mess.  It delivers on the visuals, but the characters and story all suffer around it.  I can only hope that,
just as the first film was even better balanced with an additional half-hour of footage on the DVD, perhaps they can re-edit
some coherence back into this film when its special edition comes out.  Or maybe if I ever sit down and watch them all
back to back, then it'll work beautifully in that context.  I only wish it had worked better last night in the cinema.

 My Advice: Matinee.
The second installment in the adaptation of Tolkien's trilogy has arrived--and everybody is in deep orc manure.  
Frodo and Sam (Wood and Astin) are still on their way to Mordor, being stalked by the lovable, huggable Gollum (voiced
by Andy Serkis).  Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli (Mortensen, Bloom and John Rhys-Davies) are still on the track of the other
two hobbits, Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd), who got snatched up by the Uruk--which are, as you might
recall, ostensibly orcs on PCP.  All of this to try and stop Saruman (Christopher Lee) from tag-teaming with Sauron to 
kick the ass of Middle Earth.

Bottom line: this is the most visually stunning film you will see this year.  Or probably until the third film comes out
the end of next year.  The new ""steeds"" of the Nazgul are pure sleek evil with wings, the armies of Saruman's White Hand
(too bad it wasn't a red one, then Nick Cave could have recorded the song for the closing credits) beggar description,
and Helms Deep is as badass as you could wish for.  

There are problems, though.  This film, as I understand it, was written and produced as if it were the middle part of
a much longer nine hour film--i.e., the entire trilogy.  The problem is not, as many have pointed out, that nothing gets 
started and nothing
gets resolved...because, really, that's bullshit and a copout.  If you don't call the climax of Helms Deep a resolution,
then you have some serious narrative issues to work out on your own.  The trouble is--it's just the middle.  It's as if
Jackson and company felt that, with the Mondo Edition DVD having come out just shortly before, there was no need to do
anything but pickup where the first film left off.  Or, you've just gotten back from an intermission from seeing part
one.  As a result, there's a good half-hour before this film gets
started.  And let's face it, it's a separate film from the other two--it should have some way of standing on its own.  I

"Dec 18, 2002",NEUTRAL,"This go-around bored me, confused me at times and didn't really get too much deeper into its characters."
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,"Two Towers is spectacular and exciting, and technically practically perfect, but somehow clinical. Gollum is REAL."
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,"Recalling the first Star Wars trilogy, The Two Towers is like The Empire Strikes Back, a thrilling, epic war movie."
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,"In terms of its visual and aural splendour, it is even better and bigger in scale than the first film."
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE," Well, here it is. The infernal second instalment of 
The Lord of the Rings, director Peter Jackson's three-part, $300-million adaptation of the J. R. R. Tolkien trilogy. Think of it is as Gangs of Middle-earth, featuring immense barbarian battles with an assortment of allied and warring tribes, demonstrations of medieval siege craft, entrails-spilling hand-to-hand combat, and mountains of corpses. Through it all, at hourly intervals, we return to the wide-eyed Frodo clutching his ring to his little chest and struggling with the temptation to use it. He is still making his way to Mordor to rid himself of the evil jewellery and prevent the dark lord Sauron from materializing. Director Jackson's reconstructed and transformed New Zealand is still the star of the series, a field of Armageddon, as the camera swoops under bruise-coloured skies, round white-capped peaks and stares up at sheer walls of castles and across plains throbbing with roaring armies. This is literally spectacular, but some ambivalence is unavoidable. Please feel free to declare a masterpiece if you want, but also don't feel too guilty if you nod off. The truth is, 
The Two Towers is both a triumph of design and cinematic engineering and, at the same time, long, repetitious and naive. The subject is evil (the title refers to the stronghold of wizard Saruman and the fortress of the dark lord Sauron), which seems to be a force inevitably associated with loud shouting, foul weather, bad teeth and loud music -- in other words, a lot like a British heavy-metal band. The Hobbit heroes serve as a stand-in for half-grown male innocents. There is nothing resembling adult sexuality (there is a scene where an unconscious Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) dreams of Arwen (Liv Tyler) nuzzling him, but she morphs into his horse when he comes to. If 
The Fellowship of the Ring movie tended to be too episodic, it was graced with a playful lightness: The differences in scale between the diminutive hobbit, Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) and his gangly wizard friend, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) established the playful humour; visits to the shimmery elf princess Arwen again emphasized the magical world. With 
The Two Towers, we are in the heavy-weather mid-section of the epic plot, nearly all action and momentum, with character and humour given short shrift. The members of the fellowship of the ring are split up and almost constantly under threat of death. Jackson and his screenwriters have cut and shifted chapters of the book to intercut between three separate plot lines. While Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) head toward Mordor to dispose of the ring, they are chased by the movie's most interesting character, Gollum/Smeagol, a small, bald, pink computer-generated homunculus (voiced in a hissing, peevish voice by Andy Serkis) who looks either like a dying old man or an emaciated baby, and carries on angry debates between the two sides of his personality. When the hobbits capture him, he agrees to lead them to Mordor in exchange for his freedom. Gollum is the archetypal conniving slave figure. The resemblances to both Jar Jar Binks of the 
Star Wars movies and Dobby from 
Harry Potter are striking: In these overdetermined computer-generated spectacles of one-dimensional good versus evil, these strange animal-human slave creatures seem to serve as a kind of escape valve for the movies' anarchic impulses. Meanwhile, the manly soldier Aragorn (Mortensen, who has a knack of causing women in the audience to make small moaning sounds whenever he appears on screen), the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli, the fierce dwarf (John Rhys-Davies), are on their way to save King Theoden (Bernard Hill). Thanks to some timely intervention by Gandalf (McKellen), who has returned from his big tumble in the first movie and is now transfigured in glowing white robes with a bleached beard, King Theoden is awakened from a spell in time to defend his castle against the hordes assembled by the evil wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee). Aragorn even has a hint of a flirtation with an earthly girl, the princess Eowyn (Miranda Otto), before everyone gets down to hacking body parts in the climatic nighttime battle scene. The third part of the story (and most truncated from Tolkien's writing) concerns the other two hobbits, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), who are captured in the forest by Treebeard (the voice of Rhys-Davies again), a gruff old talking tree who shepherds other trees in the forest and carries them about in his branches. Eventually, the hobbits convince Treebeard and his fellow stomping trees to help in the battle against the dark forces, which are as apt to chop wood as they are flesh and bone. As effects, the talking, walking object-tossing trees are compelling (though we saw them before in 
The Wizard of Oz back in 1939). The various tribes and species pullulate until it would take an encyclopedia to keep them straight: Humans, elves, dwarfs, orcs, wizards, Uruk-hai, Easterlings, Oliphants (elephant-like creatures employed by Sauron's forces), the Nazgul (or Ringwraiths) and Wargs. The idiocy is the sheer imbalance between good and bad: While the good characters bounce back from any multistorey fall, the fierce orc soldiers crumble, collapse and flip off barricades by the deadly dozen. These are in the tradition of the war-whooping Indians in a western, or the Germans in any American war movie, who die by the dozen for every one of the good guys."
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,"Once again, director Jackson strikes a rewarding balance between emotion on the human scale and action/effects on the spectacular scale."
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,One of the great film experiences of the millennium.
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,This is one case where you can actually believe the hype -- The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is indeed even better than its predecessor.
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,What Jackson has accomplished here is amazing on a technical level.
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,A truly spectacular film.
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,"As in Fellowship, the actors are all vivid realizations of Tolkien's characters, and there is not a weak note in the cast."
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,"`Fellowship' tried on XXL pants and made them fit...`The Two Towers' is even bigger, and this time the seams start to rip."
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE," With ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,"" it's clear that director Peter Jackson has tilted the balance decisively against the hobbits and in favor of the traditional action heroes of the Tolkien trilogy. The star is now clearly Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), and the hobbits spend much of the movie away from the action. The last third of the movie is dominated by an epic battle scene that would no doubt startle the gentle medievalist J.R.R. Tolkien. The task of the critic is to decide whether this shift damages the movie. It does not. ""The Two Towers"" is one of the most spectacular swashbucklers ever made, and, given current audience tastes in violence, may well be more popular than the first installment, ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" It is not faithful to the spirit of Tolkien and misplaces much of the charm and whimsy of the books, but it stands on its own as a visionary thriller. I complained in my review of the first film that the hobbits had been short-changed, but with this second film I must accept that as a given, and go on from there. ""The Two Towers"" is a rousing adventure, a skillful marriage of special effects and computer animation, and it contains sequences of breathtaking beauty. It also gives us, in a character named the Gollum, one of the most engaging and convincing CGI creatures I've seen. The Gollum was long in possession of the Ring, now entrusted to Frodo, and misses it (""my precious"") most painfully; but he has a split personality and (in between spells when his dark side takes over) serves as a guide and companion for Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin). His body language is a choreography of ingratiation and distortion. The film introduces another computer-generated character, Treebeard, a member of the most ancient race in Middle-Earth, a tree that walks and talks and takes a very long time to make up its mind, explaining to Merry and Pippin that slowness is a virtue. I would have guessed that a walking, talking tree would look silly and break the spell of the movie, but no, there is a certain majesty in this mossy old creature. The film opens with a brief reprise of the great battle between Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Balrog, the monster made of fire and smoke, and is faithful to the ancient tradition of movie serials by showing us that victory is snatched from certain death, as Gandalf extinguishes the creature and becomes in the process Gandalf the White. To compress the labyrinthine story into a sentence or two, the enemy is Saruman (Christopher Lee), who commands a vast army of Uruk-Hai warriors against the fortress of Theoden (Bernard Hill). Aragorn joins bravely in the fray, but the real heroes are the computer effects, which create the castle, landscape, armies and most of the action. There are long stretches of ""The Two Towers"" in which we are looking at mostly animation on the screen. When Aragorn and his comrades launch an attack down a narrow fortress bridge, we know that the figures toppling to their doom are computer-generated, along with everything else on the screen, and yet the impact of the action is undeniable. Peter Jackson, like some of the great silent directors, is unafraid to use his entire screen, to present images of wide scope and great complexity. He paints in the corners. What one misses in the thrills of these epic splendors is much depth in the characters. All of the major figures are sketched with an attribute or two, and then defined by their actions. Frodo, the nominal hero, spends much of his time peering over and around things, watching others decide his fate, and occasionally gazing significantly upon the Ring. Sam is his loyal sidekick on the sidelines. Merry and Pippin spend a climactic stretch of the movie riding in Treebeard's branches and looking goggle-eyed at everything, like children carried on their father's shoulders. The fellowship of the first movie has been divided into three during this one, and most of the action centers on Aragorn, who operates within the tradition of Viking swordsmen and medieval knights. The details of the story--who is who, and why, and what their histories and attributes are--still remains somewhat murky to me. I know the general outlines and I boned up by rewatching the first film on DVD the night before seeing the second, and yet I am in awe of the true students of the Ring. For the amateur viewer, which is to say for most of us, the appeal of the movies is in the visuals. Here there be vast caverns and mighty towers, dwarves and elves and Orcs and the aforementioned Uruk-Hai (who look like distant cousins of the aliens in ""Battlefield Earth""). And all are set within Jackson's ambitious canvas and backdropped by spectacular New Zealand scenery. ""The Two Towers"" will possibly be more popular than the first film, more of an audience-pleaser, but hasn't Jackson lost the original purpose of the story somewhere along the way? He has taken an enchanting and unique work of literature and retold it in the terms of the modern action picture. If Tolkien had wanted to write about a race of supermen, he would have written a Middle-Earth version of ""Conan the Barbarian."" But no. He told a tale in which modest little hobbits were the heroes. And now Jackson has steered the story into the action mainstream. To do what he has done in this film must have been awesomely difficult, and he deserves applause, but to remain true to Tolkien would have been more difficult, and braver. Roger Ebert was the film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times from 1967 until his death in 2013. In 1975, he won the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished criticism."
"Dec 18, 2002",NEGATIVE,The acting is magnificent.
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,"The middle installment of Peter Jackson's saga is heavy on spectacle, long on talent -- and still feels like the halfway mark of an unfinished symphony."
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,"Peter Jackson has done the nearly impossible. He has improved upon the first and taken it a step further, richer and deeper. What Jackson has done is proven that no amount of imagination, no creature, no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery"
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,"Jackson has accomplished the near-impossible, surpassing the first chapter - The Fellowship of the Ring - with a sweeping, visually magnificent work of epic proportions."
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,"While Fellowship lay clear why the plight of the One Ring matters to the creatures inhabiting Tolkien's Middle-Earth, the second film shows why it all matters to us."
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,"Two Towers should serve as a postcard to George Lucas, one that reads 'Making great movies, wish you were here!'."
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,"The gorgeously elaborate continuation of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is so huge that a column of words cannot adequately describe co-writer/director Peter Jackson's expanded vision of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth."
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,"It is grand in scale and overpowering in terms of action, but, for me, ""The Two Towers"" misfires a bit in terms of heart and soul."
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,"As with the novel, The Two Towers is a bridge more than a stand-alone work, and as such it places an emphasis on momentum over depth."
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,"Le EMPIRE STRIKES BACK de la trilogie de Jackson: plus sombre, mieux structuré, plus significatif. Mais encore un peu long et... convenu."
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE," I can’t even remember how many times I’ve read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings — seven or eight, probably. The first time was when I was around 12, and then it wasn’t until my 20s that I picked it up again, and it was odd how in the intervening years, all those tedious long stretches of battle descriptions and endless nonsense folk songs that the preteen me had skipped over had disappeared, and in their place were cutting stories of friendships cemented on the front lines and beautiful poems about loss and love. I simply could not find the bits that had bored me so the first time around. And it’s been like that every time I’ve reread Tolkien over the last decade — every other year I get the irresistible urge to dip into them again, and I find something new, and it speaks to me in a different and surprising way. With Peter Jackson’s heart-stoppingly stirring The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, it occurs to me that his filmed adaptation is like a rereading on behalf of us all, that he has found the new and different meanings in a story that we all know by heart, and that he has brought them to us in as transparent a way possible, so that it’s easy to imagine that movie audiences 50 and 100 years from now will still be able to find their own new and different meanings.
The newness Jackson finds here is something that had never consciously occurred to me before the moment I sat down to write this review: The middles of stories, from the most frivolous romantic comedy to the most action-packed thriller to the most eloquent drama, are always about the battle between hope and hopelessness. Things must look good enough for our heroes that the possibility of them winning exists but also bad enough that the possibility of them losing isn’t unlikely. Pulling off a well-told story, one that achieves the proper balance between hope and hopelessness, is all about maintaining the suspense and making us believe that winning isn’t a foregone conclusion. But it’s one thing to create suspense in a previously untold story about characters we’ve never met before, and quite another to do that with a story and characters we’ve known and loved all our lives. And still The Two Towers is nerve-wrackingly suspenseful. I’m intimately familiar with this tale. I did not expect to cower in my seat, my hand over my mouth in horror, genuinely fearful for our heroes and their world. But I did, and it made for one of the most powerful movie experiences I’ve had this year. The Two Towers is all middle-of-the-story, of course — Frodo and Sam are wandering Mordor, the burden of the One Ring increasing; Merry and Pippin are communing with Ents, their resolve to fight what needn’t be their battle increasing; and Aragorn is warming up for the coming war, his aversion to taking his place as a leader of Men falling away — it’s almost entirely hopelessness with only a smattering of hope to keep us (and the characters) going. But the sense of doom that Jackson creates is so palpable that we can’t help but share it with our heroes, and it’s so overwhelming at times that I just wanted to curl up into a ball and give up. The Ring gets heavier for us, too — Jackson has imbued his film with the weight of evil, pressing down, smothering, intractable. I had no choice to but sob my way through most of the film out of sheer despair. And I mean “sheer despair” in the best possible way. It’s far too infrequent that a film can make you sympathize this closely with its characters. In one of the most fantastical settings and one of the most fantastical stories this year, Jackson has given us one of the most emotionally genuine films of this year. There are single moments in The Two Towers of unadulterated power that suck us in, as when Saruman’s (Christopher Lee: Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, Sleepy Hollow) toady Gríma Wormtongue (Brad Dourif: Nightwatch) is stunned by the impossibly grand designs of his master. Saruman’s army of 10,000 battle-hungry orcs is simply beyond Gríma’s conception of badness, and the horrible import of its existence is all the more potent for seeing it through his eyes. The utter size and scale of Middle-Earth and its battles are numbingly, astonishingly real onscreen in a way that they never were on page. But it’s the slower building of desperation that sneaks on you until you have no place to run or hide from it. Much of it has to do with liberties Jackson and his coscreenwriters Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, and Stephen Sinclair took with Tolkien, good liberties, all — such as bringing Arwen (Liv Tyler: One Night at McCool’s, Armageddon) in for her own personal battle between hope and hopelessness, as her father, Elrond (Hugo Weaving: The Matrix, Babe: Pig in the City), urges her to leave Middle-Earth while she is drawn to await Aragorn’s (Viggo Mortensen: Psycho, A Perfect Murder) possible return. They interweave, too, as Tolkien did not, the three major stories of The Two Towers, drawing more explicit parallels between them and letting their senses of hope and hopelessness wax and wane together. Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood: The Faculty, Deep Impact, and Sean Astin: Bulworth, Courage Under Fire) journey through Mordor, guided by truly pitiable Gollum (voice and movements by Andy Serkis: 24 Hour Party People, Topsy-Turvy, assisting in creating the most startling and fully realized CGI character yet) — the dynamic between the three of them, and between Gollum and his alter-ego Sméagol, is a tug-of-war between giving up and soldiering on, and is echoed in how Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) come to terms with the harsh reality of what a win for Sauron will mean by making the disinterested tree-creatures, the Ents, understand that they cannot sit this war out. Another of those brief, staggering moments is when the younger hobbits, in the company of the Ents, come upon the ecological devastation wreaked by Saruman around his tower, all the trees ripped from the ground (the orcs’ deforestation was one of the most visceral images from the first film) — the Ents’ revenge is downright elemental. And then there’s that army, 10,000 orcs strong, descending on the last stronghold of Men, Helm’s Deep. Aragorn and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) will prevail, we know they will, whether you’ve memorized the novels or not, but for a long while, through one of the most extraordinary battle sequences ever committed to film, it’s hard to see how. When hope comes to the rescue, led by Gandalf (Ian McKellen: X-Men, Apt Pupil), whose early reappearance is a minor triumph of hope itself, your heart cheers… and then you remember that it isn’t over. It’s only beginning. Our lives are all middle-of-the-story, too — we don’t remember the beginning, and we don’t know when the end will come, and we ourselves face that constant struggle between hope and hopelessness. Leaving us here in the middle, without resolution, Jackson leaves us with a striking sense of reality amid the fantasy, and a desire to know how it will all end that diving in for another rereading of Tolkien just won’t satisfy. What other new things will Jackson find for us in the final chapter? I can’t wait to find out."
"Dec 18, 2002",NEGATIVE," As Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are led towards Mordor by Gollum (Andy Serkis), the strange and conflicted former ring bearer, their fellow Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have been side-tracked in Fangorn Forest by an equally strange creature, Treebeard (voice of John Rhys-Davies), who doesn't know what to make of them. While searching for Merry and Pip, the warrior trio of Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) learn about the people of Rohan, whose King (Bernard Hill) has been mesmerized by Saruman spy Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), as an evil army approaches to destroy them in ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.""

The only beauty to be found in ""The Two Towers"" is in the faces of the women who love Aragorn, Arwen (Liv Tyler) and the Rohan King's niece Eowyn (Miranda Otto), and the majestic New Zealand landscape. The only humor comes from Gimli, whose eagerness for battle is well met a multitude of times. This second installment of the trilogy is altogether darker, grayer, grimmer and bloodier than the first.
Unlike, say ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" this bridging film cannot stand on its own, but it does propel the action forward towards the ultimate showdown with Dark Lord Sauron. Fittingly, as battle makes for the bulk of screen time here, most of the focus stays on the heroic Aragorn, fleet bowman Legolas the elf and stalwart Gimli. Trying to find Merry and Pippin, instead the trio are shocked to be met by Gandalf (Ian McKellan), transformed from the grey to a dazzling white. The foursome travel to Rohan and cast out Wormtongue, but are dismayed by rejuvenated King Theoden's decision to take his people to Helm's Deep rather than staying to fight Saruman's army. Aragorn is visited by Arwen in his dreams and looked upon longingly by Eowyn in daytime.
As Aragorn's crew travel to Helm's Deep, Frodo and Sam are kept from entering the gates of Mordor by Gollum, who tells them of a secret entrance. This scene seems a strong homage to ""The Wizard of Oz,"" as Sauron's soldiers all but break out into ""All we owe..."" while our intrepid trio hide behind a rock. The ring grows into an ever heavier burden upon Frodo as they follow Gollum across the Dead Marshes, gazing upon the white faces of the dead who float just below the water's surface. Production designer Grant Major's stunning work here appears inspired by the Pre-raphaelite paintings of John William Waterhouse. Like Merry and Pippin held by the Ent, Frodo and Sam are captured by Gondor leader Faramir (David Wenham) and kept from completing their journey.
At Helm's Deep, a battle of biblical proportions concludes ""The Two Towers"" in a breathtaking climax that reunites Merry and Pippin with the others when Treebeard rallies the Ents to join the fray. Jackson creates a landscape that could have sprung from the mind of Hieronymous Bosch. He then lands us gently with Frodo and Sam as Sam wonders if there will ever be stories told about them. As in the first film, the second ends with the two Hobbits about to begin a more difficult journey than they just completed.
The cast are all fine, with McKellan again a standout. The film's energy is always goosed when Sir Ian is on screen. Mortensen, Bloom and Rhys-Davies all benefit with a deepening of character while Otto is a nice addition. Dourif is so deliciously evil, one is saddened by the banishment of Wormtongue. The biggest surprise, though, is the utter perfection of Sean Astin as Sam Gangee. While Wood is mostly wide-eyed, Astin's simple down to earth Sam shows the true heart of a Hobbit.
Visual effects supervisor Jim Ryziel and Peter Jackson's Weta Digital Ltd. have outdone themselves with Gollum, a creature who looks like one of those 1960s Margaret Keane paintings of a sad, saucer eyed child if it had been an Auschwitz survivor or crypt keeper. Gollum's conversations with himself, as good tries to keep evil from betraying Frodo, are some of the film's highlights. Also beautifully realized are the Ents, mossier and more individualistic variations on the apple-throwers of Oz. Howard Shore's more ominous score is unleavened by Enya's warblings this time around.
Besides the fact that ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" will never be a film unto itself, it must also be mentioned that it does suffer somewhat from repetition. Gollum covets his 'precious' once too often and cinematographer Andrew Lesnie is overly fond of swooping panoramic shots of tiny figures trudging across landscape. The many battles that occur in the film frequently utilize those annoying closeups that make it impossible to tell what's going on.

The many battles that occur in the film frequently utilize those annoying closeups that make it impossible to tell what's going on. ""Braveheart Down Under with Wizards"" would be a more appropriate title for the much anticipated second installment of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy as director Peter Jackson takes us back to Middle Earth to continue the saga begun in ""LotR: The Fellowship of the Ring."" The Fellowship has splintered into three groups with young Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) bound and determined to return the coveted Ring from whence it came - to the fires of Mordor in ""The Two Towers.""
This is an absolutely critic proof film that will draw the fans of part one (and, of course, J.R.R. Tolkein's epic tale) in legions as they clamber to see what happens next to their favorite heroes. The members of the Fellowship, you'll remember, had to divide their forces with Frodo and his loyal friend, Samwise, tasked to destroy the much sought after One Ring of Power. Human warrior Aragorn (Vigo Mortensen), elf archer Legolas Greenleaf (Orlando Bloom) and battle hardened dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are tracking down a band of Orcs that hold hobbits Merry and Pip captive, while the great wizard Gandalf the Grey has made a journey of his own to the depths of hell.
These adventures closely follow Tolkein's middle book in the trilogy as it follows up with the characters developed in ""The Fellowship."" In ""The Two Towers"" we know all the players, what their missions are and what foes they must fight. Helmer Jackson and company roll up their sleeves and get down to the business of mustering the forces of good and evil as Sauron, with the help of his lackey wizard Sarumon (Christopher Lee), brings his spawn, a phalanx of super Orcs called Uruks, into battle against the humans and their allies of the Middle Earth. This formula has all the makings to provide epic battles and, guess what? The many ""LotR"" fans will not be disappointed.
The combination of spectacular landscape photography, huge battles with armies numbering in the thousands and the sinister doings of Sauron and his minions are all well and good, but there are a couple of other elements in ""The Two Towers"" that, if possible, overshadow the epic telling of the war for control of Middle Earth. Only tantalizingly shown in part one, the ubiquitous Gollum/Smeagol (voice of Andy Serkis) comes to the fore as the previous holder of the One Ring that tracks Frodo and Sam in hopes of getting back his ""precious"" possession. This singular little character turns out to be one of the best things in the film and attains the status of such mythical creations as Yoda and ET. Truth be told, when the action shifts away from this complex diminutive creature, I could not wait until Smeagol came back to center screen. (Gollum is the best special F/X in a film heavily laden with visual effects.)
The other aspect of ""The Two Towers"" that knocked me out is the appearance of the fabulous Ents, the treeherders in charge of caring for the vast, ancient forests of the fantasy world. One Ent, in particular, Treebeard (voice of John Rhys-Davies), takes on the task of helping Merry and Pippin rejoin their friends and musters the rest of the tree people to help out in the attack on Saruman's heavily guarded fortress. The battle that ensues is one of several that take place during the course of the film but is the most visually striking and memorable.
The regulars from ""The Fellowship,"" for the most part, are back and there are one or two new editions to the story with Bernard Hill appearing as Theoden, the King of Rohan and, in a terrific, slimy performance, Brad Dourif as Sauron's puppet and spy in the kingdom, Grima Wormtongue. Lest you romantics fear, Liv Tyler appears again (in flashback) as Aragorn's elfish lover Arwen Undomiel.
This huge project has made Peter Jackson a formidable force in world-class filmmaking and will ensure his A-list status for the rest of his career. If ""The Two Towers"" makes only half of what ""Fellowship"" made at the box office it will be considered a major success. But I don't think this will be the case. The huge, ready-made audience that is chomping at the bit to spend their hard earned dollar are going to flock to the theater in droves. The almost relentless battle sequences makes the characters take a back seat at times, making this a slight bit less enthralling development-wise than ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" but ""The Two Towers"" is an epic event.
There are elements of derivativeness to parts of ""The Two Towers"" with the opening battle between Gandalf and a demon from hell being a reverse ""Moby Dick"" and with Howard Shore's music score often sounding like something out of ""Braveheart."" The ""conventional"" battles between men and Orcs are handled in routine manner and much of the action shone too close in. These are minor nits, though.

battle when considering the success of The Two Towers, the second installment of the filmed adaptation of
J.R.R. Tolkiens The Lord of the Rings,
which I am now fairly convinced that when seen as a whole will be one of the
most important and potent films in the history of cinema. First, how does this chapter stand on its
own? Second, how does it continue the story? To both considerations, I have strong reservations (especially toward the
former), but its important to remember the nature of this story. Director Peter Jackson establishes from the start that this is not a
sequel but a direct continuation of The
Fellowship of the Ring and that The
Lord of the Rings will be one gigantic film once The Return of the King is released next year. So, no, the film does not stand on its own, but it is a better film as a
result. As for the matter of its
success as a continuation of the story, its difficult to assess because this
second part of the film proper has a much larger focus. This is not the story of specific characters but of the world in which
they live. The main character of the
film is not any one member of the fellowship that began its quest to destroy the
Ring of Power but all of them separately on their own journeys and Middle-Earth
itselfits politics, its inhabitants, and its eventual fate. When
we last left our heroes, they were left separated and desolate. We last saw Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) walking down a
mountainside toward Mordor, the realm of the dark lord Sauron, who is making one
final and sweeping attempt to regain his stranglehold on Middle-Earth. The quest is taking its toll on Frodo, whose struggle to fight the power
of the Ring is becoming overwhelming. Just
when things seem hopeless, the two happen upon help from a most unexpected
companionone who has been following their journey with much interest from the
start. Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and
Pippin (Billy Boyd) are in the clutches of the ferocious Uruk-Hai, soldiers of
the traitorous wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee). In pursuit of their friends are the remaining members of the fellowship,
Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), heir to the throne of men, Legolas (Orlando Bloom),
an elf, and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), a dwarf. Their path will change upon meeting a long-lost friend and discovering
even more treason in the country of Rohan, where the king Théoden (Bernard
Hill) is under the influence of Saruman through the work of his servant
Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). Jackson
and fellow screenwriters Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, and Stephen Sinclair have
a lot of ground to cover in this film, which means a more plot-heavy story. Fortunately, the time spent wandering with these characters in The
Fellowship of the Ring keeps us grounded in their own personal journeys. The Two Towers is an entirely
different film from its predecessor. This
is a time of war for Middle-Earth, and the central themes of the film are the
ways in which people and nations react to such a threat. Despite Tolkiens adamant argument against the existence of allegory in
his novel, its difficult to watch the film without thinking of the world
political climate before and during the first years of World War II. However, its easy to assume that such a climate exists at any given
time of conflict and that the main themes are universal allegory not specific. Theres Théoden, who once freed from the grip of Saruman seems just as
prone to leading his people to destruction. His willingness to run and hide in the cul-de-sac sanctuary of Helms
Deep leads to a spectacular assault in which hundreds are pitted in defense
against ten thousand. Then there are
the ents, a type of walking, talking tree who sit around and deliberate while
missing the issue entirely. On
a technical level, Jackson has crafted a film of scope and vision on par with the first
installment. The cinematography by Andrew Lesnie once again captures the elegance of
the New Zealand topography while establishing a unique look for each new location to which the
heroes travel, from the bleached and ruined former splendor of a city of Gondor (home of men) to the claustrophobic, rain-drenched Helms
Deep. The visual effects once again combine a variety of techniques, from
traditional miniatures to computer technology. A few computer-generated creatures make appearances, and theyre
rendered with much care. But more
importantly, there are two characters created with digital effects that show how
far technology has come. First are
the ents, particularly Treebeard (voice of Rhys-Davies), who are admittedly
rough around the edges but interesting enough to compensate for it. Then theres Gollum, the pitiful, mangled creature who held onto the
Ring for far too long. Andy Serkis
performs Gollum, meaning he acted out the part and was later digitally painted
over. Gollum is not a special effect
but a living, breathing character. Hes
a pathetic, wholly sympathetic wretch, and Serkis work is extraordinary. The
Two Towers leads up to the exhausting Helms Deep sequence, which is
really only the beginning of the films finale. This is one of the most technically brilliant battle sequences ever
captured on film. Jackson
has outdone himself here, building up to a battle for an entire film and then
truly delivering on his promise. Dissecting
the battle, one finds multiple levels of superiority. The effects here are
seamless. Thousands
of Uruk-Hai march to the outset of the fortress walls. Jackson holds the moment of their arrival just long enough for tension to
escalate. He uses the same trick at the turning point (to avoid spoilers, a massive
catastrophe for the fortress), when everything and everyone seems to simply stop
dead in their tracks to grasp what has just happened. Humor comes through as Gimli and Legolas compete for
kills. Its only the beginning as well, and Jackson eventually intercuts this battle with two other vital ones."
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,"  The opportunity to see history being made on the movie 
                      screen comes but once or twice a generation, and right here, 
                      right now, one of those rare events is happening with Peter 
                      Jackson's adaptation of the ""Lord of the Rings"" 
                      trilogy. Last winter saw the audience on its first rich 
                      excursion into Tolkien's Middle-Earth with ""The Fellowship 
                      of the Ring,"" and now comes ""The Two Towers,"" 
                      the second film in the series, which picks up exactly where 
                      its predecessor left off, diving headfirst into the material 
                      as if not a moment has gone by since we were last stranded 
                      in the realm of wizards, mortals, elves, dwarfs and hobbits. 
                      Much has happened since the adventure was halted 12 months 
                      ago—the first endeavor received 13 Academy Award nominations, 
                      grossed over half a billion dollars, and was even recently 
                      released as an extended cut on DVD—and yet the initial 
                      experience remains fresh in the mind, enduring even when 
                      other ambitious projects in that time frame have been completely 
                      forgotten (the latest ""Star Wars,"" anyone?). Being more of a visionary than a filmmaker, though, Jackson 
                      knew his task in ""Fellowship"" wasn't nearly as 
                      much about adapting a complex story as much as it was about 
                      sculpting plausible exteriors. A year later, his fundamental 
                      mission finds itself being inverted; imagery and atmosphere 
                      are already established, but the narrative is caged at the 
                      direct center of a wide-scale conflict, lacking a true beginning 
                      and ending and challenging several of the essential laws 
                      of cinematic storytelling in the process. He probably saw 
                      the questions long before the writers ever did: where does 
                      the journey resume? Does it reference the past? Where does 
                      it stop before abandoning the viewer for yet another year? 
                      Since this is the bridge between an introduction and a conclusion, 
                      Jackson realizes that ""The Two Towers"" is probably 
                      the most important film of the series. But do not doubt 
                      for a moment that he will be unable to dodge those obstacles; 
                      this is, after all, the same man who made the best film 
                      of 2001. Surging from the vibrant heels of the first ""Rings"" 
                      chronicle, ""The Two Towers"" takes the tradition 
                      of Tolkien's work into a darker, creepier and more seriously 
                      woven direction, magnifying the scope to something that 
                      the first feature barely scratched the surface of. But it 
                      isn't a film about continuing where other things left off, 
                      mind you; instead, it's a strong and surprisingly self-reliant 
                      piece, referencing its predecessor in occasional dialogue 
                      exchanges without dwelling on it very long before we're 
                      thrown right back into the fray. At the core, naturally, 
                      it is crucial for the picture to carry the support of ""Fellowship"" 
                      over into the final chapter of the saga, but don't assume 
                      that the endeavor requires you to know every detail of what 
                      went on beforehand, either. The movie not only compliments 
                      an evolving package, it is a triumph as an independent work 
                      as well. Gone, furthermore, are the lush green hills of Hobbiton 
                      and the intricate establishments of Rivendell; in place 
                      of those colorful locations are the most swarthy, moody 
                      and menacing little corners seen thus far in Middle-Earth, 
                      steeped so greatly in the looming onslaught of evil that 
                      they nearly choke the players of their basic sense of sanity. 
                      At the opening of the film, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) 
                      and Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) are fearfully slogging their 
                      way though the peaks and marshes just east of the land of 
                      Mordor, vaguely recollection on all the adventures that 
                      severed the fellowship, resulted in the death of a comrade, 
                      and eventually forced them to abandon protection and seek 
                      out Mordor alone. Their journey, however, becomes further 
                      plagued by weariness and dread when Gollum, the withered 
                      former host of the one ring, appears out of nowhere and 
                      literally foists his way into the hobbits' dangerous travels. 
                      Gollum shows allegiance to the ring and its master, vowing 
                      to safely guide the current ring-bearers closer towards 
                      Mordor, but behind the fearful and crippled facade, he is 
                      a troubled being at war with himself, fighting off a brewing 
                      dark side even when the light one seems to be fading. While their journey progresses ever so carefully towards 
                      the gates of Middle-Earth's heart of evil, the remaining 
                      members of the fellowship—Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), 
                      Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies)—pick 
                      up on the trail of the other hobbits, Merry Brandybuck (Dominic 
                      Monaghan) and Peregrin Took (Billy Boyd), who were captured 
                      at the end of ""Fellowship"" by a wave of orcs and 
                      are being taken back towards Isengard, the site of the rising 
                      Uruk-hai army and its master Saruman the White (Christopher 
                      Lee). What Aragorn and his partners don't realize, at least 
                      at first, is that the missing hobbits were able to successfully 
                      flee from their captors on the outskirts of Fenghorn Forest, 
                      and they are now being protected by the gigantic and wise 
                      Treebeard, the oldest living being in Middle-Earth who guards 
                      over the woods like a guardian to all of nature. The title ""The Two Towers"" refers to the alliance 
                      made between the fortresses of Isengard and Mordor, the 
                      two root sites of evil in Middle-Earth that strive for the 
                      same goal: to completely eradicate the race of men so that 
                      the pursuit of the ring is tipped greatly in favor of the 
                      dark lord Sauron. The dramatic urgency of this conflict, 
                      needless to say, forces the hobbits and their quests to 
                      be played down a bit in order to make mortal men the central 
                      focus of the plot, and as a result, we spend a good portion 
                      of the three-hour running time observing Aragorn, Legolas 
                      and Gimli in their attempt to unite the fragmented kingdom 
                      of Rohan to stand against the armies of their enemies, who 
                      are moving faster and growing more rapidly in numbers by 
                      the hour. Rohan, of course, is a rather important locale for the 
                      events of the ""Rings"" trilogy, and what helps 
                      add to the movie's muscle is not only the fact that the 
                      place was never even mentioned in ""Fellowship,"" 
                      but the fact that it helps introduce us to several new and 
                      interesting characters as well. There is, for instance, 
                      Éowyn (Miranda Otto), a beautiful young woman with 
                      eyes for Aragorn and a yearning to do battle alongside the 
                      men of her country, and Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), 
                      a sadistic messenger of Saruman's who manipulates his way 
                      into the Rohan kingdom and poisons the mind of its ruler, 
                      the wise and incessant King Théoden (Bernard Hill). 
                      The difficulty with any film follow-up is in establishing 
                      new personas successfully, but in ""The Two Towers,"" 
                      the writers have not only matched the bright and solid characterizations 
                      of ""Fellowship,"" but in ways have surpassed them. 
                      Éowyn's endurance and independence shine through 
                      even when the race of men demand that she hold her skills 
                      back, while Théoden brings the concept of high rulers 
                      down to a compassionate human level. Much of the movie revolves around war, and yet no so much 
                      that it undermines characterizations or perspective. Countless 
                      fantasy endeavors, especially those that utilize big battles, 
                      tend to overly emphasize the use of this kind of action 
                      until the sequences become too involved and difficult to 
                      clearly identify anyone, but thankfully, Peter Jackson has 
                      kept his wits about him when approaching this particular 
                      aspect of the screen treatment. The much-hyped battle between 
                      men and orcs at Helm's Deep, in fact, is one the most exhilarating 
                      war-oriented sequences I have ever seen, and not only is 
                      it the visual centerpiece for ""The Two Towers,"" 
                      but perhaps for all of recent cinema as well. But is the movie better than ""The Fellowship of the 
                      Ring?"" Very close, but not quite. Admittedly, the first 
                      film's zest and enthusiasm is a tad more fulfilling than 
                      it is here, and the freshness factor elevated that zeal 
                      onto a platform of reasoning beyond just being pure excitement. 
                      But in no way is this a distraction or an insult to the 
                      final result here; in fact, I choose to think of it as an 
                      indirect compliment. Any way you look at it, this is the 
                      one effort that could have either held the interest or dwindled 
                      our expectations for the final chapter, so the fact that 
                      it pulls its own weight completely apart from its predecessor 
                      is quite a remarkable achievement. Moreover, the movie is 
                      beautiful, magnetic, breathtaking, exciting and imaginative 
                      on every scale. And at any rate, Middle-Earth and its inhabitants 
                      are starting to jump off the screen like they never have 
                      before."
"Dec 18, 2002",POSITIVE,"It's a heartier, goofier yarn, refreshingly short on the pompous solemnity that bogged down its predecessor."
"Dec 17, 2002",POSITIVE,"As impossible as it might seem, The Two Towers is even bigger in scope than The Fellowship."
"Dec 17, 2002",POSITIVE,"Even if it's just a narrative bridge, this second series installment is still a glorious reward for those who paid attention last time."
"Dec 17, 2002",POSITIVE,"The second chapter only cemented my love for the story & characters, but also my belief that this story in either 3-or-6 hour intervals won't be fully served until The Return of the King ends."
"Dec 17, 2002",POSITIVE,The grandest spectacle since David Lean hung up his light meter.
"Dec 17, 2002",POSITIVE,"Peter Jackson, in the second installment of his Lord of the Rings trilogy, has confounded expectations and crafted a film that's both livelier and darker than the first one."
"Dec 17, 2002",POSITIVE,"With superb technical work and some terrific individual sequences and fun computer-generated characters, I found the film to be a tad better and more entertaining than the original."
"Dec 17, 2002",POSITIVE,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is the Tolkien trilogy's middle passage through Middle earth, and the middle is a bit of a muddle."
"Dec 17, 2002",POSITIVE," ""The Two Towers,"" the second installment of Peter Jackson's three-film adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings,"" is a magisterial caesura. That may be an odd thing to say about a movie that climaxes with one of the most amazing epic battle sequences ever put on film, a movie that, like its predecessor, conjures up new worlds seemingly every time you blink your eyes, a film that keeps dropping wonders into your lap like precious gifts casually given.  With ""The Two Towers"" it seems very clear that we are in the midst of one of the great achievements in fantasy filmmaking and in epic filmmaking. Pauline Kael once said that directors die on movies of this magnitude and turn into technicians. Miraculously, Peter Jackson hasn't died. The filmmaker is alive and well alongside the tactician he must have had to become to pull off the feat of turning Tolkien's books into movies. For all the lushness and wonder on the screen in the two installments we have seen of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" there are also tremendous reserves of discipline.  You could hardly blame Jackson if he fell in love with the sets created by production designer Grant Major and let Andrew Lesnie's camera dote on them. But the strictness of both Jackson's pacing and D. Michael Horton's editing tells you that you are in the hands of people who realize that wondrous effects are only good to the extent that they advance narrative and deepen emotion. Jackson has set the standard against which all other special-effects movies must be measured, not just because what we see here is so spectacular but because Jackson never allows the effects to become the movie's raison d'être.  That discipline is especially important in ""The Two Towers"" because the film is the difficult middle child of the trilogy, without either the cumulative storytelling power or emotional surge of ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" It's a fractured tale that cuts between the temporarily broken band of the fellowship as they meet separate challenges on their way to destroy the evil power of the Dark Lord Sauron. Frodo (Elijah Wood, whose performance is both intensely physical and vibrating with a sense of spiritual terror) and his faithful companion Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin, whose doughy cheeks bring the movie a grounded touch of the ordinary and familiar) are making their way to Mordor to dispose of the Ring of Power, which will destroy the dark forces.  Separated from these two, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen, whose performance brings the character close to being one of the movies' great romantic heroes), the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom, with his angelic pixie looks), and the dwarf warrior Gimli (John Rhys-Davies, whose boisterous aggression and appetites make him deeply funny) are on the trail of hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), who have fallen into the hands of the Orcs. Hanging around the edges of the story are Gandalf (Ian McKellen), who has been transformed into an even more powerful wizard, and his dark doppelgänger Saruman (Christopher Lee, who, with a stick-thin build that seems as if it were being eaten away by sheer corruption, looks like Rasputin reincarnated as an evil saint).  And there are new characters: Théoden, the King of Rohan (Bernard Hill), whose kingdom is threatened by Saruman's army of Orcs and who has fallen under the spell of one of the dark wizard's minions, Gríma (Brad Dourif -- with his black stringy hair and Dwight Frye grin, he looks completely at home in the world of Tolkien). There is also Théoden's niece Éowyn (the Australian actress Miranda Otto, who also looks at home in Tolkien but for reasons having to do more with enchantment than evil), who begins falling in love with Aragorn -- whose own lady love, Arwen (Liv Tyler), may be sailing to the Undying Lands of the west with the rest of the elves to escape the coming wrath of Sauron.  These films have been impeccably cast. I don't know why, playing a wizard, McKellen should seem more human and be more likable than he has ever been on-screen. It can't be just the bulbous fake nose that gives him a touch of fleshiness. It's that he plays Gandalf with a mischievous sagacity that, in the dramatic scenes, translates into real authority. And as in the first film, we continue to experience the terrors of the heroes' quest through the blue of Elijah Wood's wide eyes. Wood manages the very difficult feat of playing a good character without becoming sappy or dear. When the ring starts to weigh him down (literally) we fear for Frodo because we are confronted with the real possibility that this good hobbit will go bad. And that possibility is reflected in the movie's major new character, Gollum. No movie creature has been as mesmerizing since the initial appearance of Yoda in ""The Empire Strikes Back."" The role is credited to the actor Andy Serkis, and apparently Serkis (who also supplies the voice of the character) was present acting in the scenes and his image was then computer animated. However the filmmakers did it, Gollum is a stunning creation. He made a brief appearance in the first film, the creature in the dark pond hissing about his ""preciousssss,"" the ring that Frodo's uncle Bilbo discovered and took away from him. He reenters here, tracking Frodo and Sam, determined to retrieve his precious, and winds up as their guide to the land of Mordor. But what kind of guide?  Gollum, whose real name is Sméagol, was once a creature quite like the hobbits. He was driven mad by his lust for the Ring and the movie implies that his fate is the one for which Frodo is headed. Gollum is inhabited by both his former self, who surfaces as a painful memory of lost contentment, and the mad, grasping passion to which the Ring has felled him. If Gollum is to work at all, we must find him pitiable in his wretchedness and, I'm assuming thanks to the combination of the CGI and Serkis' performance, we do.  He appears both wizened, his body shrunken like that of a frail old man, and with the unlined skin of a newborn. There is something fetuslike about Gollum, both figuratively and literally, especially in his wet, baby-wide eyes. He is unformed, a creature who can go either way. The strangled, hissing voice that Serkis employs conveys the sense of a creature in pain beyond his comprehension. We are both repelled by Gollum and moved to compassion. There wasn't a second he was on-screen when I felt I could take my eyes off him. He is the most amazing of this installment's wonders.  That scanty plot summation may give you an idea of how disparate the story is in terms of location alone. It also hints at the niggling dissatisfaction of ""The Two Towers."" Because it is the middle of the story, the film doesn't offer the anticipations of a story's beginning or the resolutions of its end.  Here I have to make a confession. Though I believe it's generally the critic's duty to know the sources of literary adaptations, I have never read Tolkien. I fully intended to after seeing ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" but -- perhaps I may be forgiven for this! -- because I was so thrilled by the film, I simply didn't want to know what would happen next. The changes that Jackson has made here, which have been outlined to me by a trusted friend who knows the books backward and forward, may outrage some Tolkien purists. But if the opinion of someone who hasn't read the books is worth anything, it seems to me that there is one way that Jackson has honored what I have long heard Tolkien admirers speak of: the author's creation of a new language.  Despite the fact that the first two installments of ""The Lord of the Rings"" (and, I imagine, the final one) are overwhelmingly visual, they also seem to belong to a great tradition of oral storytelling. Think of how the first movie begins, with the screen shrouded in darkness for what seems like minutes while a narrator introduces us to the story and images slowly emerge. To someone who hasn't read the books, the words here have an almost incantatory strangeness. During both movies I found myself wondering, ""How do you spell those names?"" and trying to imagine how any combination of letters could do justice to the richness and weight of the words and names that set your imagination racing.  What we are watching here is just part of one long film. That's the peril of judging it in isolation, which is what seeing it spread out over three Christmas movie seasons compels us to do. ""The Two Towers"" isn't a botch or a falling off. Jackson doesn't violate the cardinal movie rule of telling us instead of showing us -- he doesn't wallow in exposition. But we sometimes feel whisked away from one plot strand when we want to stay with it for a while, and that division of our attention hinders the movie's dramatic momentum. Given the nature of the story, I'm not sure there was a better solution.  This problem is particularly noticeable in the sections where Merry and Pippin are taken up (literally) by Treebeard, the head Ent, a guardian of the forest who looks like a giant walking tree. The movie periodically cuts back to Treebeard leading them to his forest home and it seems as if they are walking and walking for days. Those scenes feel as if Jackson had suddenly remembered Merry and Pippin and dashed back to check on them. And the sequence isn't an isolated bit of magic. The glittering images Jackson puts on-screen are an embarrassment of riches. Like the sight of the years literally dropping from Théoden's visage as the curse on him is lifted. Or a flashback to Gandalf's battle with the Balrog, a huge, dragonlike creature. Or the warrior Orcs, as terrifying as they were in the last movie, with their skin looking as if oil-smeared leather had been dragged over their bones (you imagine the foul stench they give off whenever the Orcs are on-screen).  Then there is the battle of Helm's Deep, about which it is not too much to say that Jackson risks comparison with the great battle sequences of Akira Kurosawa and D.W. Griffith. (The sight of the massed Orc armies arrayed for battle recalls the epic precision of the troops arranged for battle in Stanley Kubrick's ""Spartacus."") The sheer scale of this battle scenes doesn't lend itself to the horrible intimacy of the hand-to-hand combat in ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" Those scenes, in which we were conscious of the physical exertion of the warriors, of their being smeared with earth and sweat, called up Orson Welles' staging of the Battle of Shrewsbury in his ""Chimes at Midnight"" (for my money, the greatest battle sequence ever put on film). The combat in that film anchored the fantasy to a recognizable physical reality. It gave some weight and tragic resonance to the film.  In ""The Two Towers,"" the battle of Helm's Deep seems to take place in some vision of hell dredged up from our collective imaginations. Théoden and the armies of Rohan, assisted by Aragorn and Legolas and Gimli, are besieged in their fort by 10,000 Orc fighters in the midst of a pitch-black rainy night. At the beginning of the scene you can't imagine that that sky will ever clear, and it seems to be the dread and blood lust seeping out of the skins of the combatants that have turned it black. The sheer size of the sequence is awe-inspiring (particularly the sight of the Orcs' raised spears, which appear to go on for miles). But it's not just the size that's impressive here. Jackson has staged and shot the scene with a masterly clarity, the sort that most contemporary action directors can't seem to manage in a simple shootout. It's not just that Jackson is succeeding on an epic scale here, it's that he's working on a scale most directors wouldn't dare.  The battle of Helm's Deep is the strongest evidence of what is so startling about Peter Jackson as a filmmaker. Unlike almost any other director I can think of who dares to work on an epic scale, Jackson doesn't seem to have a whiff of megalomania to him. There may be simple reasons for that. The fact that the relative economy of his budget (and when the average action movie costs nearly $100 million, $270 million for three three-hour movies is bupkiss) compelled him to keep focused. But I think something else is at work, not only Jackson's sense of duty to the legions of Tolkien admirers but his own love for the material. It may even be that the story of heroes who have put themselves at the service of a cause has inspired him to put himself at the service of the material.  The film has the feeling of teamwork, as if Jackson were engaging his production crew and cast in his own grand quest. If humility is possible in epic filmmaking, Peter Jackson possesses it. Time and again in ""The Two Towers"" the camera swoops over the mountains and valleys of Middle Earth and you think that this must be what it's like to see with God's eyes. Luckily, Peter Jackson hasn't forgotten that he's a human being. Copyright © 2024 Salon.com, LLC. Reproduction of material from any Salon pages without written permission is strictly prohibited.

"Dec 17, 2002",POSITIVE,"Visually breathtaking, viscerally exciting, and dramatically moving, it's the very definition of epic adventure."
"Dec 17, 2002",POSITIVE,Just know that everything that transpires in The Two Towers vindicates the zeal with which the viewing public clasped Fellowship to its collective breast.
"Dec 17, 2002",POSITIVE,The most incredible accomplishment of Towers is that at its heart it is a transition film that lasts nearly three hours and holds the viewer's attention.
"Dec 17, 2002",POSITIVE,"If The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers seems less transparently inviting than its predecessor, this quality has less to do with the film than with the quest itself."
"Dec 17, 2002",POSITIVE," When the final chapter closes on Peter Jackson’s adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings,” the whole extravaganza -- three features, nine hours and a catalog of characters as seemingly infinite as the films’ crew -- may well be heralded as one of the more heroic ventures in commercial cinema. Launched last December to enormous success with “The Fellowship of the Ring,” the ongoing epic has now entered an awkward adolescence with its middle feature, “The Two Towers,” on its way to its concluding volume, “The Return of the King.” Slated for completion next year, the entirety of the “Rings” looks auspicious even if in its present manifestation this once and future landmark is a bit of a yawn. Based on the second volume of Tolkien’s novel, “The Two Towers” begins fairly soon after “The Fellowship of the Ring” leaves off with the hobbits, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Samwise (Sean Astin), warily traveling toward the Dark Tower of Mordor, the lair of Sauron the Great. Conquered in an ancient war, Sauron has been gathering his forces with the intention of obliterating the world of men, Middle-earth, for which he needs the ring. In the first film, Frodo had become the ring’s reluctant keeper, charged with its destruction by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), a mission that transported him out of the idyll of his homeland, the Shire, and into a fellowship with eight other Middle-earth inhabitants. Splintered at the close of the first volume, the fellowship has now scattered to fight its enemies separately. “The Lord of the Rings,” built on a bedrock of mythic archetypes and sagas such as “Beowulf,” is essentially a quest story but one in which the seeker aims to renounce power, rather than to seize it. That makes Frodo uncharacteristically humble for a hero and an unusually appealing seeker no matter what the troubled times, and it also speaks to why the book was a cult favorite during the 1960s. (The hobbits’ fondness for smoking an herb called pipe-weed likely appealed to the book’s original counterculture fan base, as well.) Although Frodo hails from the pastoral Shire and is by nature and inclination gentle, each step of his journey brings him closer to cataclysmic warfare that rumbles during the first volume, erupts in the second and rages throughout the third. Tolkien began writing “The Lord of the Rings” in 1936 and for years after its publication insisted that it had nothing to do with the Second World War. Jackson has no such qualms but his inspiration is cinematic not political. In “The Two Towers,” he cribs an iconic image of massed troops from Leni Riefenstahl’s propaganda reverie, “Triumph of the Will,” but the allusion loses its punch when you realize that another shot of goose-stepping troops has been lifted from “The Wizard of Oz.” Tolkien built his story on foundation myths; Jackson builds his on movies: The film’s most charming new creature, a mossy shepherd named Treebeard, walks like the heron described by Tolkien but looks like a relation of the animated trees in “Oz.” When Gollum (voiced by Andy Serkis, with goggling computer-generated eyes and slithering silvery body) returns to the scene to pull the word “master” from its mouth, it’s with the same sinister fawning as Dracula’s helper Renfield. Despite these cinephile fillips, Jackson and fellow screenwriters Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Stephen Sinclair have enough to do just keeping Tolkien’s histories and characters in play. To that end, the new film faithfully opens with the human warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), a huntsman with his own impending quest issues, in the company of the Elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and the Dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies). Together, the three are hotfooting across green slopes in search of two other fellowship members, the hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), who have been kidnapped by Orcs, servants of Sauron’s strongest ally, the wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee). Tolkien devotes the first half of “The Two Towers” to Aragorn’s exploits and the second to those of Frodo; Jackson instead oscillates between the questing travelers before getting swept up in a battle that nearly proves the undoing of Aragorn and the film. While searching for the hobbits, Aragorn and his companions enter the human kingdom of Rohan, where they’re soon engaged in protecting its people from Sauron’s army. Jackson spends an interminable amount of time in Rohan, lavishing his attention on a battle that consumes less than a chapter in the novel. Set at night, the fight unfolds with hordes of the enemy (“thick as marching ants,” in Tolkien’s words) descending in waves. Despite Mortensen’s energetic vaults across the set, the tension slackens precipitously. It isn’t only that there’s no fun to be had watching ants get squashed; it’s that the battle, designed for the video-game generation, proceeds in frustrating starts and stops, as if Jackson couldn’t get past the first level. With “The Fellowship of the Ring,” Jackson delivered us into never-before-seen worlds. The fellowship covers new ground in “The Two Towers” but the story bogs down in Rohan, a dreary stopover that fails to capture the imagination; unlike the Shire or Elvish lands, it doesn’t look that different from the back-lot Middle Ages we’ve seen elsewhere. During the past few decades, computer technologies have enhanced (and waylaid) numerous films but it wasn’t until Jackson’s first try at Tolkien that we saw the greater possibilities of those technologies, particularly in the realm of fantasy, where now everything seems possible. After years of anemic space escapades in which the blue screen was invariably more important than the flesh-and-blood actors, digital video technologies were put in the service of a juicy story and not the reverse. That more or less holds true in “The Two Towers” even if for stretches at a time the tools at Jackson’s disposal distract him from what he does best, which is push the story forward with the enthusiasm of a filmmaker who hasn’t put ego before movie love. The director’s great strength is the confidence with which he translates Tolkien’s vision into visual imagery even if he still gets tripped up converting that vision into dialogue. “The Fellowship of the Ring” was periodically hampered by the writers’ attempts to cut swaths through the narration. There’s as much exposition in “The Two Towers” but because Jackson and his screenwriter partners don’t want to repeat themselves, they lay out the story even less clearly than they did on their first outing. When Aragorn consults with Gandalf, it’s easy to get lost in a thicket of names and allegiances. It was during one such eyelid-drooping moment while watching “The Two Towers” that I flashed on an old Gary Larson cartoon that pokes gentle fun at the nomenclature found in books of this sort by contrasting the names we give dogs with those they give themselves. “I am known as Vexog,” says one dog (a.k.a. Rex), “Destroyer of Cats and Devourer of Chickens.” “I am Zornorph,” says another, proudly, “the One Who Comes by Night to the Neighbor’s Yard, and this is Princess Sheewana, Barker of Great Annoyance and Daughter of Queen La, Stainer of Persian Rugs.” The absurdity of the dog names was a relief, giving me a momentary reprieve from the film and its insistent monumentality. At that instant, I stopped bumming about the second film and began looking forward to the third. Such is the nature of geek love. As with “The Fellowship of the Ring,” the excitement and pleasure of “The Two Towers” comes from the feeling that we’re doing more than simply watching a film but have, rather, embarked on an epic journey with like-minded travelers. If the second film never reaches the highs of the first -- we have met the players before and there are no new worlds of wonder -- it nonetheless invests moviegoing with a sense of adventure. Like Frodo and Aragorn, we have to cover a lot of middling expository ground in “The Two Towers” -- here, we’re just passing through on our way to the end.

"Dec 17, 2002",POSITIVE,"The Two Towers is epic filmmaking at its finest, an intelligent and literate translation of a well-known and well-loved book that has enthralled millions. This film will no doubt do the same."
"Dec 17, 2002",POSITIVE,"Jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can, but all the bouncing back and forth can't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting."

"Dec 17, 2002",POSITIVE," 
As most people know, all three of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" books were adapted to film at the same time, so this cinematic transition to episode two appears seamless.
 
Taking up where ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" left off, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" reunites us with hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), who have been separated from The Fellowship and are lost in the hills of Emyn Muil.  They are still mourning the loss of kindly wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), who was killed at the end of Part One.  But fear not: Gandalf may be down, but he's not out.
 
The hobbits are followed by the mysterious Gollum, an amazing creature which is totally computer generated and voiced by Andy Serkis.  Gollum used to be the keeper of the ring until Frodo's uncle, Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm), stole it from him and brought it back to the Shire in the first film.
 
The overprotective Sam harbors an immediate dislike towards Gollum, but the ever-trusting Frodo, perhaps feeling a kinship for someone who has also had to bear the pressures and consequences of holding the ring, takes pity on the strange, hairless little being.  Gollum joins Sam and Frodo, leading them to Mordor, the realm of the evil lord Sauron. Sauron intends to regain the ring, which will give him the power to throw Middle Earth into everlasting darkness and despair.
 
In two other parallel journeys, hobbits Merry (Dominic Monagahan), and Pippin (Billy Boyd) are being held captive by the Uruk-hai, and human warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), elf archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli the dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) are besieged by evil forces in the Rohan kingdom, whose King Theoden (Bernard Hill) has fallen under the spell of Sauron's henchman Saruman (Christopher Lee -- looking remarkably like Cher in her last video).
 
Once again filmed against the magnificent scenery of New Zealand (with a little tweaking from the folks in the special effects department), the story flashes back and forth between the three adventures, as members of The Fellowship face unimaginable obstacles and dangers, including a lethal army of 10,000 soldiers under the leadership of Saruman.
 
The same creative team is behind this second installment in the trilogy, including writer/producer/director Peter Jackson.  Jackson received an Academy Award nomination for ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" and will undoubtedly do the same for ""The Two Towers.""  This film is an astonishing accomplishment, building upon the first installment with immense power and sense of purpose.
 
This middle part of the trilogy has to shoulder a gigantic amount of plot while advancing the story steadily toward the climaxes coming in the final episode.  In addition to Gollum and King Theoden, numerous other important characters are introduced: Theoden's beautiful niece Eowyn (Miranda Otto), who catches the eye of Aragorn despite his love for Arwen (Liv Tyler); Eowyn's brother Eomer (Karl Urban); and the sleazy Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), King Theoden's advisor who is really a spy for Saruman.
 
The weakest of the three stories is the one involving Merry and Pippin.  After they escape from the Uruk-hai during a ferocious battle, they are taken in by Treebeard, a living, walking tree-shepherd who is the oldest living being in Middle Earth.  Until the very end of the film, Merry and Pippin just ride around in Treebeard's branches while lamenting the tree's lack of interest in helping The Fellowship fight against Saruman.
 
Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli face much more action, intrigue and deception in the Kingdom of Rohan, while Sam and Frodo -- who have penetrated the fortress at Barad-dur deep within the dark forests of Mordor -- barely survive numerous attempts to kill them and steal the ring.
 
It's not the valiant members of The Fellowship, however, but the woefully pathetic Gollum who steals the show.  His constant inner battles to either help or kill the hobbits -- and thereby regain the coveted ring -- are beautifully portrayed through the exquisitely crafted special effects.
 
Between the lightsaber-wielding Yoda in the latest ""Star Wars,"" the quivering Dobby in the latest ""Harry Potter,"" and now the pop-eyed Gollum, the powers-that-be may have to announce a new category for the Academy Awards: maybe something like Best Non-Human/Computer Generated Performance of the Year.  And no, neither Madonna nor Keanu Reeves could be considered... although it would be tempting.
 
""The Two Towers"" does not disappoint.  This film is a fitting companion to the astounding ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.""  It just keeps getting better and better.  If part three, the conclusion to this grand adventure, maintains the same caliber -- and there seems no reason to think it won't -- this trilogy will go down in cinematic history as a true masterpiece.

While searching for Merry and Pip, the warrior trio of Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) learn about the people of Rohan, whose King (Bernard Hill) has been mesmerized by Saruman spy Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), as an evil army approaches to destroy them in ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.""

The only beauty to be found in ""The Two Towers"" is in the faces of the women who love Aragorn, Arwen (Liv Tyler) and the Rohan King's niece Eowyn (Miranda Otto), and the majestic New Zealand landscape. The only humor comes from Gimli, whose eagerness for battle is well met a multitude of times. This second installment of the trilogy is altogether darker, grayer, grimmer and bloodier than the first.
Unlike, say ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" this bridging film cannot stand on its own, but it does propel the action forward towards the ultimate showdown with Dark Lord Sauron. Fittingly, as battle makes for the bulk of screen time here, most of the focus stays on the heroic Aragorn, fleet bowman Legolas the elf and stalwart Gimli. Trying to find Merry and Pippin, instead the trio are shocked to be met by Gandalf (Ian McKellan), transformed from the grey to a dazzling white. The foursome travel to Rohan and cast out Wormtongue, but are dismayed by rejuvenated King Theoden's decision to take his people to Helm's Deep rather than staying to fight Saruman's army. Aragorn is visited by Arwen in his dreams and looked upon longingly by Eowyn in daytime.
As Aragorn's crew travel to Helm's Deep, Frodo and Sam are kept from entering the gates of Mordor by Gollum, who tells them of a secret entrance. This scene seems a strong homage to ""The Wizard of Oz,"" as Sauron's soldiers all but break out into ""All we owe..."" while our intrepid trio hide behind a rock. The ring grows into an ever heavier burden upon Frodo as they follow Gollum across the Dead Marshes, gazing upon the white faces of the dead who float just below the water's surface. Production designer Grant Major's stunning work here appears inspired by the Pre-raphaelite paintings of John William Waterhouse. Like Merry and Pippin held by the Ent, Frodo and Sam are captured by Gondor leader Faramir (David Wenham) and kept from completing their journey.
At Helm's Deep, a battle of biblical proportions concludes ""The Two Towers"" in a breathtaking climax that reunites Merry and Pippin with the others when Treebeard rallies the Ents to join the fray. Jackson creates a landscape that could have sprung from the mind of Hieronymous Bosch. He then lands us gently with Frodo and Sam as Sam wonders if there will ever be stories told about them. As in the first film, the second ends with the two Hobbits about to begin a more difficult journey than they just completed.
The cast are all fine, with McKellan again a standout. The film's energy is always goosed when Sir Ian is on screen. Mortensen, Bloom and Rhys-Davies all benefit with a deepening of character while Otto is a nice addition. Dourif is so deliciously evil, one is saddened by the banishment of Wormtongue. The biggest surprise, though, is the utter perfection of Sean Astin as Sam Gangee. While Wood is mostly wide-eyed, Astin's simple down to earth Sam shows the true heart of a Hobbit.
Visual effects supervisor Jim Ryziel and Peter Jackson's Weta Digital Ltd. have outdone themselves with Gollum, a creature who looks like one of those 1960s Margaret Keane paintings of a sad, saucer eyed child if it had been an Auschwitz survivor or crypt keeper. Gollum's conversations with himself, as good tries to keep evil from betraying Frodo, are some of the film's highlights. Also beautifully realized are the Ents, mossier and more individualistic variations on the apple-throwers of Oz. Howard Shore's more ominous score is unleavened by Enya's warblings this time around.
Besides the fact that ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" will never be a film unto itself, it must also be mentioned that it does suffer somewhat from repetition. Gollum covets his 'precious' once too often and cinematographer Andrew Lesnie is overly fond of swooping panoramic shots of tiny figures trudging across landscape. The many battles that occur in the film frequently utilize those annoying closeups that make it impossible to tell what's going on.
Still, ""The Two Towers"" is sure to delight the hordes awaiting it. It's a brutally majestic forerunner to ""The Return of the King.""

""Braveheart Down Under with Wizards"" would be a more appropriate title for the much anticipated second installment of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy as director Peter Jackson takes us back to Middle Earth to continue the saga begun in ""LotR: The Fellowship of the Ring."" The Fellowship has splintered into three groups with young Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) bound and determined to return the coveted Ring from whence it came - to the fires of Mordor in ""The Two Towers.""
This is an absolutely critic proof film that will draw the fans of part one (and, of course, J.R.R. Tolkein's epic tale) in legions as they clamber to see what happens next to their favorite heroes. The members of the Fellowship, you'll remember, had to divide their forces with Frodo and his loyal friend, Samwise, tasked to destroy the much sought after One Ring of Power. Human warrior Aragorn (Vigo Mortensen), elf archer Legolas Greenleaf (Orlando Bloom) and battle hardened dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are tracking down a band of Orcs that hold hobbits Merry and Pip captive, while the great wizard Gandalf the Grey has made a journey of his own to the depths of hell.
These adventures closely follow Tolkein's middle book in the trilogy as it follows up with the characters developed in ""The Fellowship."" In ""The Two Towers"" we know all the players, what their missions are and what foes they must fight. Helmer Jackson and company roll up their sleeves and get down to the business of mustering the forces of good and evil as Sauron, with the help of his lackey wizard Sarumon (Christopher Lee), brings his spawn, a phalanx of super Orcs called Uruks, into battle against the humans and their allies of the Middle Earth. This formula has all the makings to provide epic battles and, guess what? The many ""LotR"" fans will not be disappointed.
The combination of spectacular landscape photography, huge battles with armies numbering in the thousands and the sinister doings of Sauron and his minions are all well and good, but there are a couple of other elements in ""The Two Towers"" that, if possible, overshadow the epic telling of the war for control of Middle Earth. Only tantalizingly shown in part one, the ubiquitous Gollum/Smeagol (voice of Andy Serkis) comes to the fore as the previous holder of the One Ring that tracks Frodo and Sam in hopes of getting back his ""precious"" possession. This singular little character turns out to be one of the best things in the film and attains the status of such mythical creations as Yoda and ET. Truth be told, when the action shifts away from this complex diminutive creature, I could not wait until Smeagol came back to center screen. (Gollum is the best special F/X in a film heavily laden with visual effects.)
The other aspect of ""The Two Towers"" that knocked me out is the appearance of the fabulous Ents, the treeherders in charge of caring for the vast, ancient forests of the fantasy world. One Ent, in particular, Treebeard (voice of John Rhys-Davies), takes on the task of helping Merry and Pippin rejoin their friends and musters the rest of the tree people to help out in the attack on Saruman's heavily guarded fortress. The battle that ensues is one of several that take place during the course of the film but is the most visually striking and memorable.
The regulars from ""The Fellowship,"" for the most part, are back and there are one or two new editions to the story with Bernard Hill appearing as Theoden, the King of Rohan and, in a terrific, slimy performance, Brad Dourif as Sauron's puppet and spy in the kingdom, Grima Wormtongue. Lest you romantics fear, Liv Tyler appears again (in flashback) as Aragorn's elfish lover Arwen Undomiel.
This huge project has made Peter Jackson a formidable force in world-class filmmaking and will ensure his A-list status for the rest of his career. If ""The Two Towers"" makes only half of what ""Fellowship"" made at the box office it will be considered a major success. But I don't think this will be the case. The huge, ready-made audience that is chomping at the bit to spend their hard earned dollar are going to flock to the theater in droves. The almost relentless battle sequences makes the characters take a back seat at times, making this a slight bit less enthralling development-wise than ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" but ""The Two Towers"" is an epic event.
There are elements of derivativeness to parts of ""The Two Towers"" with the opening battle between Gandalf and a demon from hell being a reverse ""Moby Dick"" and with Howard Shore's music score often sounding like something out of ""Braveheart."" The ""conventional"" battles between men and Orcs are handled in routine manner and much of the action shone too close in. These are minor nits, though. ""Braveheart Down Under with Wizards"" would be a more appropriate title for the much anticipated second installment of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy as director Peter Jackson takes us back to Middle Earth to continue the saga begun in ""LotR: The Fellowship of the Ring."" The Fellowship has splintered into three groups with young Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) bound and determined to return the coveted Ring from whence it came - to the fires of Mordor in ""The Two Towers.""

If there is a primary quality needed to bring J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings to the screen, it is vision - an attribute possessed in abundance by director Peter Jackson. In more than 100 years of motion pictures, few cinematic campaigns of this magnitude have been mounted. Not only has Jackson faced the daunting task of creating and populating an entirely new world based on Tolkien's blueprint, but he has contended with the real-word rigors of a two-year shooting schedule and an initially nervous group of purse string holders.
 
The popular and critical success of The Fellowship of the Ring vindicated Jackson's perseverance. Nevertheless, even as the Oscar nominations came pouring in, the director was moving on. The plaudits heaped upon the first installment would lose their luster if either of the succeeding episodes, The Two Towers and The Return of the King, failed to live up to expectations. And, considering the high ground occupied by The Fellowship of the Ring, the bar would be at an astronomical altitude for the other movies.
 
Of the three pieces of the Middle Earth puzzle, The Two Towers is the one with the biggest handicap. It is afflicted with the ""middle chapter syndrome"" - an inherent obstacle for the second episode of any trilogy. The Two Towers has no real beginning or end. (This is as true of the book as it is of the movie.) It takes situations and characters introduced in The Fellowship of the Ring and prepares them for The Return of the King. The trick is to immerse audiences ""in the moment"" and keep them from looking ahead - a daunting task, to be sure, but one that Jackson is up to.
 
In nearly every way that counts, The Two Towers is The Fellowship of the Ring's equal. In terms of tone, pacing, character development, plot advancement, and visual splendor, there is no drop-off. More importantly, the continuity is seamless (one advantage of filming the trilogy as a single project), allowing a viewer familiar with the first movie to flow effortlessly into the second. Of course, therein lies a drawback, as well. The Two Towers cannot stand on its own. Familiarity with The Fellowship of the Ring is not just advisable, it is mandatory. Anyone attempting to watch The Two Towers without having seen (or read) the first installment is headed for confusion and disillusionment.
 
The Two Towers essentially picks up where The Fellowship of the Ring concludes, albeit following a short flashback to the battle between the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) and the Balrog. In the first movie, when Gandalf tumbles from the bridge, we see him disappear into the abyss. Here, however, we follow him as he and the Balrog tumble endlessly downward, continuing their struggle along the way. In the wake of his victory over his foe, Gandalf is reborn as a white wizard, and returns to the world above to re-unite with his former companions. In the company of Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the elf (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli the dwarf (John Rhys-Davies), the wizard heads for the city of Rohan, where he hopes to convince the king, Theoden (Bernard Hill), that war is upon his kingdom. At the same time, the hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), having escaped from their orc captors, flee into the forbidding Fanghorn Forest, where they encounter Treebeard the Ent (voice of John Rhys-Davies), a giant shepherd of trees who decides to protect the two diminutive interlopers.
 
Meanwhile, to the East, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) find themselves lost on their way to Mount Doom. And, in addition to suffering from the physical difficulties of such an arduous journey, Frodo is beginning to show the strain of bearing the ring, with the Dark Lord Sauron's baleful glare constantly seeking him. The creature Gollum (Andy Serkis), who has been following the hobbits, attempts to steal the ring from Frodo, but is subdued and captured. Thereafter, he reluctantly agrees to serve as Frodo and Sam's guide and take them to Mordor.
 
Stodgy Tolkien purists who disliked some of the changes Jackson made to The Fellowship of the Ring may be outraged by what he and his screenwriters have done here. The Two Towers differs much more from its written inspiration than the first movie. Yet, in tone and spirit, this remains very much Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, although altered in a manner that makes it more of a living, breathing cinematic endeavor rather than a point-by-point regurgitation (like the Harry Potter films). The movie version of The Two Towers also ends before the book does. Certain events that occur late in the novel will be incorporated into the beginning of the film adaptation of The Return of the King.
 
The stunning climax of The Two Towers is the battle of Helm's Deep - a 30-minute spectacle that features the siege of a seemingly impregnable stone fortress by an army of 10,000 creatures of Sauruman (Christopher Lee). Inside that fortress is a small force of several hundred humans and elves, led by Aragorn, Theoden, Legolas, and Gimli. Although the attack occupies only a dozen pages of Tolkien's novel, Jackson has transformed it into the centerpiece of the film - an amazing, heart-stopping battle against impossible odds. And, while a huge special effects contribution is needed to make the battle such an awesome feast for the eyes, Jackson never lets the CGI work overwhelm the human element of what's going on, and there are plenty of scenes in which costumes, set design, and makeup enflame our imaginations, not computer work.
 
Jackson has added dashes of mirth and romance to the film - two elements in short supply in the novel. Most of the humor, which is decidedly low-key, involves Gimli, who occasionally seems to be around as much for comic relief as anything else. For example, in the middle of the battle of Helm's Deep, he is infuriated that his number of kills can't keep pace with Legolas'. On the romantic front, Aragorn, who is promised to the elven princess Arwen (Liv Tyler), finds himself the object of attention for Theoden's niece, Eowyn (Miranda Otto). This sets up a triangle.
 
The returning actors have grown nicely into their roles. There are changes, of course. Elijah Wood's Frodo is haunted and weary, relying more upon Sam. Wood's body language expresses the weight Frodo feels from bearing the ring. Mortensen's Aragorn is a more heroic figure. Ian McKellan plays Gandalf with greater authority now that he has been transformed from a gray wizard to a white one. Newcomer Bernard Hill brings a sense of authority to Theoden. Miranda Otto is regal and strong as Eowyn. Brad Dourif is the slimy Grima Wormtongue, the servant of Sauruman who speaks poison into Theoden's ear. And, as Gollum, Andy Serkis (whose performance is overlaid with computer imagery) presents his twisted character as a strangely tragic and conflicted creature. We feel pity for Gollum.
 
The Two Towers starts out a little slowly, but the rousing second half, which gathers momentum like a boulder racing downhill, will leave audiences craving more when the end credits roll. Combined, The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers represent one of the most engrossing and engaging six-hour segments of cinema I have ever enjoyed. If the final third of the puzzle is the equal of the first two, this will go down as one of the crowning achievements of cinema. Like its predecessor, The Two Towers is a great motion picture, and not to be missed by anyone who appreciates fantasy adventure."
"Dec 17, 2002",POSITIVE," New Line Cinema probably risked $200 million to film all three parts in New Zealand at once. After the first film, we knew the gamble had paid off. The Fellowship of the Ring won four Oscars and sold $861 million in tickets around the world. Part two, The Two Towers, picks up right where the first one ends, and the special effects are even more spectacular. But the middle part of a trilogy is always the toughest to tell. And it's even tougher in this case, because of our expectations. This movie simply doesn't match up to the first. In the middle book, on Middle Earth, the fellowship is divided. The film intercuts three separate stories — tough to do under the best of circumstances — but impossible here because two of the three are better read than seen. Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) are lost through most of the movie — trying to find their way to Mordor, to destroy the ring. In this part of J.R.R. Tolkien's epic, he took time to discuss philosophy, not exactly a visual treat. In the movie it's time to go get popcorn. Meanwhile, other members of the fellowship are in danger. Giant walking, talking trees have captured two other hobbits. This passage is a great read — especially by flashlight when your folks think you're asleep — but on film it looks silly. In the film's towering visual story, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) battles Wormtongue, who has turned the addled King Theoden into a pawn of the evil wizard Saruman. But even the battle scenes are better in the book. There are simply too many computer-generated images for us to have any idea who is fighting whom."
"Dec 16, 2002",POSITIVE," Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) figures out how to ward off bad juju from Saruman the White, in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers."
"Dec 16, 2002",NEUTRAL," There's no avoiding it any longer. It's time to drop the needle on the second disc in the biggest double-gatefold concept album in history: the next instalment in the Lord of the Rings saga, entitled The Two Towers. Warning! Film contains intense combat and fantasy horror scenes, long-haired men smoking unfeasibly long pipes, women with pointy ears, and lots and lots of interminable nerdish nonsense. When The Fellowship of the Ring came out last year I gave grave and unrecallable offence to the Tolkie fanbase with disobliging remarks about how the whole middlebrow mythology was dull and overrated, and how this admittedly beautifully designed children's movie was treated with baffling reverence by adults showing a misplaced, sentimental loyalty to their earlier, 12-year-old selves. Like a couple of other writers on this paper, I was deluged with hate mail. Some seriously claimed that ""Tolkie"" was an offensive slur. Well, L Ron Hubbard's writings became the basis of a bona fide religion, so perhaps JRR Tolkien's will too, and this sort of raillery will indeed become incorrect. I have had late-night arguments with pro-Tolkien friends, triggered off by rashly calling their need to establish an emotional relationship to this intricate but sterile world a symptom of regressive disorder. Do grown-ups need to worry their heads about Frodo and Bilbo, I asked - at which point the Tolkies mounted a very effective counter-attack, assaulting the boring Prousties for banging on about the mythic backstories of Baron De Charlus and Robert Saint-Loup. Touché . The Two Towers unarguably makes a powerful impression, and with this second movie the simple accretion of mass, together with director Peter Jackson's maintenance of its unflagging energy and his fanatical attention to detail, mean that the epic is taking some sort of shape. These persuasive elements strengthen what was always powerful about the first film: breathtaking use and creative modification of the New Zealand landscape, standing in for Middle Earth. And at the apex of The Two Towers is a tremendous battle sequence which Jackson puts over with full-throated gusto: the half-hour siege at the very end as the Dark Lord Saruman's forces assault the people of the kingdom of Rohan, who have taken their last stand at the fortress of Helm's Deep. But this is a three-hour film we are talking about, and for long, long periods of time the nagging question is - does it have to be quite so boring? The answer (which by the way is yes) lies in the fact that the classic values of clear, direct storytelling do not apply in the normal way. Jackson is forced to intercut between three separate plot-lines, a plate-spinning process which, though dexterously achieved, is inevitably laborious. We begin with the two hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) journeying towards Mordor to dispose of the Ring for good and all. They are pursued by the mysterious Gollum (Andy Serkis), a CGI-character with an unearthly resemblance to Dobby from Harry Potter. Captured by the two Hobbits, Gollum agrees to lead them to Mordor if they will release him. Meanwhile, in another part of the imaginary universe, the inexpressibly hunky Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) together with his Fellows, the Elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli the lovable and stout-hearted dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) come to the aid of the people of Rohan, battling the evil Saruman. In this they are helped by Gandalf (Ian McKellen) who has returned from the dead, dressed all in Persil white, and, like Saruman, now has Mary Hopkin tresses of snow-white hair too. Interestingly, the comic discrepancy in height between all these species is not emphasised as much as in the first film, with the exception of much knockabout fun at the expense of the bluff old soldier Gimli. Dwarves are obviously the Gurkhas of the Tolkien world. The third part of the tale concerns two jolly hobbits, played by Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd: Merry and Pippin - two pert names which show Tolkien's donnish desire to create an intensely English mythology; I can just hear him and the other pipe-puffing Inklings approvingly rolling ""Merry"" and ""Pippin"" around their tongues. They are captured in the forest by Treebeard, a very large talking tree, who stomps massively around with them in his tree-branch hands, achieving nothing very much in plot terms, until it is time for him to discover some tree-murdering vandalism, and, like Birnam Wood in Macbeth, the trees take up arms against the dark forces. The acting in all this is earnestly, effortfully bland. Just as in the first episode, Elijah Wood wears a permanent expression of pop-eyed awe, and everyone is utterly outclassed by Ian McKellen's Gandalf and Christopher Lee as Saruman, who despite appearing only fleetingly has a thousand times as much screen-presence voltage as most of the cast. McKellen, as ever, is a joy. He has real charisma; what a mystery it is that he has not worked more on the big screen. Gandalf is certainly the only character capable of being funny or impish without being heavy-handed. The only time when The Two Towers really convinces, when it actually involves you in its solemn world, is in that barnstorming final battle sequence. Great stuff, with echoes of Kurosawa - but even here the wilfully clotted, muddled narrative lets it down. The big finish at Helm's Deep is blurred by the action merging with a distracting cataclysm at Saruman's stronghold Orthanc Tower. Couldn't it have been simple, for once? So episode two finishes more or less where it began, with Frodo and Sam forging manfully - or rather hobbitfully - onward for their final confrontation with the enemy next Christmas, leaving behind only the mystery of how some people can, with a straight face, claim that all this represents a serious evocation of good and evil. It's been a very watchable, distinctive, if over-extended FX spectacular. Nothing more."

"Dec 16, 2002",NEGATIVE," From the very first sequence of Peter
 Jackson’s The Two Towers — a bravura opening that
 stunningly recalls and continues a central sequence from The Fellowship of the Ring — we
 feel that we’re in good hands. It’s a promise the subsequent
 three hours deliver on imperfectly. The second film of Peter Jackson’s historic three-part
 adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the
 Rings extends and in some ways deepens the achievement of the
 first film, but falls short of it in other ways. By almost any
 standard, The Two Towers is an immensely accomplished
 film; but the standard this film must be judged by is
 first of all Tolkien’s book, and secondly Jackson’s brilliant
 first film. By that rarefied standard, Towers cannot be called an
 unqualified success. This film is also destined to be more
 controversial than its predecessor, as Jackson and
 co-screenwriter Frances Walsh have taken
 significantly more liberties with the text than before. Subplots
 have been changed or added, and many of the most memorable events
 from Tolkien’s second volume have been deferred to next year’s
 The Return of the
 King. These changes are not without some rationale. Tolkien’s third
 book, padded with appendices, tells a shorter part of the story
 than the first two; so it makes sense for Jackson, who rightly
 wants the third film to be the biggest and best, to enhance that
 story at the expense of this one. Also, whereas Tolkien’s
 Towers includes, for example, a decisive confrontation
 with the evil wizard Saruman, in the films Saruman is useful as a
 more palpable villain than the incorporeal Sauron, seen only as a
 disembodied Eye; so this confrontation has been postponed. Nevertheless, after watching Towers, I’m more
 conflicted about the end result than I was about
 Fellowship. Subsequent viewings of Fellowship have
 only confirmed my enthusiasm for that film; how this new film
 will hold up to multiple viewings remains to be seen. Like Tolkien’s book, Peter Jackson’s The Two Towers is
 more spectacular and epic in scope than its predecessor. As the
 members of the Fellowship go their separate ways, the simple,
 episodic storyline of Fellowship gives way to multiple
 plot threads running from one end of Middle-earth to the
 other. Hobbits Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee (Elijah Wood and Sean
 Astin) head toward the dark land of Mordor, seeking to destroy
 the Ring, while their countrymen Merry and Pippin (Billy Boyd and
 Dominic Monaghan) are taken prisoner by the forces of Saruman
  (Christopher Lee), who don’t know these aren’t the hobbits
 they’re looking for. Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), with
 the elf Legolas and the dwarf Gimli (Orlando Bloom and John
 Rhys-Davies), seek to rescue Merry and Pippin, but their paths
 continue to diverge. The oppression and struggle ominously foreshadowed in
 Fellowship is here fully realized. The forces of Saruman,
 no longer limited to marauding bands but now vast armies, march
 relentlessly through Middle-earth, destroying and subduing.
 Combat sequences previously limited to skirmishes here give way
 here to full-fledged war in one of the most ambitious battles
 ever committed to film, the siege at Helm’s Deep. We see here more of the spectacular vistas of Middle-earth,
 from the endless rugged terrain of Rohan and Gondor, to the
 tangled interior of Fangorn Forest, so different from
 Lothlórien, to the rustic Norse-looking architecture of
 Edoras, the capital city of Rohan, to the fearsome outsize
 construction of Black Gate, the doorway to Mordor, to the massive
 stone walls of Helm’s Deep, the ancient mountain fastness of
 Gondor. While this film has nothing to compete with the charm and
 beauty of the first film’s visions of the Shire and Rivendell,
 The Two Towers isn’t meant to compete with
 Fellowship but to build on it, to presuppose it and go
 from there. Jackson has already established what is at stake if
 the Shadow triumphs; this is not a film about light, but about
 the battle against darkness. In addition to the established cast from the first film,
 there’s a host of new characters, from wretched Gollum (voiced by
 Andy Serkis), to those most outlandish and unimaginable denizens
 of Middle-earth, the tree-shepherding Ents, to grey-bearded King
 Théoden of Rohan (Bernard Hill) and his martial niece and
 nephew, Ã‰owyn and Ã‰omer (Miranda Otto and Karl Urban),
 to Faramir of Gondor (David Wenham), brother of Boromir (Sean
 Bean), who was slain at the climax of the last film. Gollum and the Ents rank among the most astonishing triumphs
 in the series to date. Gollum, in particular, goes far beyond a
 special effect, not only for the breathtaking realism of his
 appearance and movements or his seamless integration with the
 physical actors and environments, but for Andy Serkis’s textured,
 conflicted vocal performance. (Serkis also contributed to
 Gollum’s physical performance via motion-capture technology,
 creating a more organic and natural sense of motion than totally
 computer-created movements.) As for the Ents, Jackson and his effects team have simply
 filmed the unfilmable. Treebeard (voiced by Rhys-Davies, who also
 plays Gimli), with his wonderfully arboreal face and peculiar
 high-stepping gait; the swaying communion of the Entmoot; and
 above all the colossal consequences of the rousing of the Ents
 are among this film’s most vivid and memorable
 accomplishments. As characters, on the other hand, the Ents get short shrift.
 One of the film’s most glaring weaknesses is the way it keeps
 returning to redundant footage of Treebeard with Merry and Pippin
 in his branches, striding through Fangorn en route to the Entmoot — a walk that seems to last half the film or more. Again and
 again Jackson returns to this image, not wanting us to lose track
 of Merry and Pippin but having nothing for them to do. It’s
 clearly a holding pattern, and quickly becomes monotonous and
 frustrating. It’s unfortunate, because had Jackson (so to speak) axed some
 of this walking footage, he could easily have made room for
 other, more interesting parts of Merry and Pippin’s story-arc,
 such as the intrigues and complications of their escape from the
 Uruk-hai, only gestured at in the film. Even if Jackson had
 simply chosen to prolong footage of the Entmoot rather than the
 walking, it could have served as a kind of character development,
 since the important point about the Ents is how deliberate, even
 vegetative, they are in everything they do. Treebeard’s journey to the Entmoot isn’t the only place where
 The Two Towers feels less taut and efficient than it might
 have been. The Fellowship of the Ring had a narrative
 urgency that came from Jackson’s efforts to do justice to as much
 of Tolkien’s narrative as possible; every scene, every moment had
 to advance the story, without a moment wasted. At times it even
 felt rushed, but in a way that suggested the richness of the
 underlying material. It was easy to imagine the same events being
 treated at much greater length — a potential partly realized by
 the extended-edition
 DVD released last month. With The Two Towers, on the other hand, events no
 longer feel rushed, and at times even feel stretched out (""like
 butter scraped across too much bread""). The build-up to the
 battle at Helm’s Deep, for example, is awfully long, with lots of
 footage of warriors girding for battle. It seems melancholy to say it, but short of restoring the
 scenes presumably deferred till the next film, it’s not easy to
 imagine an extended version of this film running thirty or forty
 minutes longer without seeming padded. Of course, we’ll have to
 wait and see what Jackson finally does to know for sure. One character who could easily benefit from more screen time
 is Saruman; despite his importance as a tangible villain, he’s
 given virtually nothing to do. In fact, his most noteworthy
 moment is a fleeting appearance glimpsed during a startling
 interpretation of the rousing of Théoden — one of the most
 intriguing creative contributions the filmmakers have to
 offer. Because the climactic episode of The Two Towers — Frodo
 and Sam’s confrontation with the ancient, bloated evil of Shelob — is among the events deferred till the next film, it was
 necessary to invent another climactic event for them. Jackson and
 Walsh accomplished this by significantly altering the role of
 Boromir’s brother Faramir in the story. Of all the changes to the
 story, this is the one that may prove most disconcerting to
 Tolkien fans, since Faramir’s very character is substantially
 affected. Other changes, including the addition of another
 death-and-rebirth subplot and the inclusion of more material
 inspired by an appendix about the romance of Aragorn and the
 Elf-princess Arwen (Liv Tyler), are easier to roll with; and a
 much-discussed Arwen-Aragorn-Ã‰owyn ""triangle"" turns out to
 follow the book’s treatment quite closely (which is to say,
 Ã‰owyn is drawn to Aragorn, but his heart belongs to
 Arwen). In addition to the relative lack of narrative efficiency,
 there’s something else lacking in The Two Towers less easy
 to quantify. The most fearful images from Fellowship — the
 terrifying Nazgûl; the dread Eye of Sauron — seem somewhat
 diminished here. In Fellowship, the Eye was a disorienting, overwhelming
 vision that filled the screen for brief instants at a time. In
 Towers, it’s become a special effect hovering between two
 prongs atop Barad-Dûr tower (looking, as a friend commented,
 not unlike a ""power coupling"" from Attack of the Clones). The
 Nazgûl, too, are still ominous but no longer the stuff of
 nightmares. Against these misgivings must be weighed the film’s great
 strengths, notably the superb realization of Gollum’s inner
 conflict and outward appearance, the magnificent two-part
 conclusion of the episode that began at the bridge of
 Khazad-Dûm, and the staggering sieges at Helm’s Deep and
 Isengard, as well as the many smaller moments and elements
 successfully brought to life from Tolkien’s story. As with the ""middle"" films of many trilogies, final judgment
 of The Two Towers may have to await the final chapter,
 next year’s Return of the
 King. What I can say now is that, along with
 Fellowship, this film delivers much of what is great about
 the book, and remains an order of magnitude above all previous
 cinematic efforts at ""fantasy"" or epic fairy-tale mythopoeia. Even more than last year’s extended edition of The
 Fellowship of the Ring, this year’s lavish four-disc
 release of Jackson’s extended version of The Two Towers so
 improves on the original theatrical release as to make it
 irrelevant. This is the version of the film that matters. In my review of the original film, I wrote, #&147;It seems
 melancholy to say it, but short of restoring the scenes
 presumably deferred till the next film, it’s not easy to imagine
 an extended version of this film running thirty or forty minutes
 longer without seeming padded."" For example, the impression in the theatrical version that
 Pippin and Merry spent most of the film in a holding pattern,
 endlessly carried by Treebeard through the forest, is
 substantially mitigated by a restored scene of the hobbits on the
 ground, where they get to drink Ent-water. The Merry and Pippin
 storyline is also improved by a refreshingly cheerful epilogue at
 Isengard that makes me long for next year’s Return of the King extended
 edition, which Jackson has confirmed will include the ultimate
 confrontation of Gandalf and Saruman, cruelly cut from the
 theatrical version of the third film. Another welcome addition is a major flashback scene that sheds
 new light on Faramir and his relationship with his father
 Denethor (John Noble) and older brother Boromir (Sean Bean), who
 was killed at the end of Fellowship. While Faramir still
 doesn’t come off as noble in the film as in the book, he is more
 sympathetic and his actions are seen in a new light. Incidentally, the flashback also makes Boromir himself more
 sympathetic at the expense of Denethor, whom the film makes the
 instigator of Boromir’s participation in the Council of Elrond
 and his personal interest in the Ring. While this diverges from
 the books, where Gandalf tells us that Boromir was the one who
 insisted on going to the Council, I can’t say I particularly mind
 seeing Denethor take part of the rap for Boromir’s fate. Other happy enhancements include a nod to the presence of
 Huorns at Helm’s Deep, additional footage of Aragorn and Eowyn,
 and an interesting allusion to the missing Tom Bombadil episode
 from Fellowship (though no a sign of the merry old fellow
 himself). If I were re-rating the film based on the extended
 edition, I just might bump up the rating to ""A"" / four
 stars (though I still prefer Fellowship — and, now,
 Return of the
 King). Once again the four-disc set overwhelms with two discs of
 supplemental material and four commentary tracks, the most
 interesting being that of Jackson and his co-screenwriters Fran
 Walsh and Philippa Boyens, though for entertainment value many
 will prefer to listen to the actors. Among the bonus material is
 a feature on Tolkien that discusses his friendship with fellow
 Christian myth-maker C. S. Lewis and a documentary on the
 technical and acting challenges that went into the making of
 Gollum. It’s interesting how these extended editions have almost taken
 the sting out of cruelly omitted bits in the theatrical release
 of The Return of the King, especially the final
 confrontation of Gandalf and Saruman. We wince as the moment for
 the scene comes and goes, knowing that it ought to have been
 there, but there’s comfort in thinking that next November, it
 will be."

"Dec 13, 2002",POSITIVE," 

It certainly surpasses ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" in terms of wit, action and narrative drive. What it lacks - at least until the climax - is the first film's wow-factor. We are now accustomed to the environs and inhabitants of Middle-earth. 

Without an explanation for trilogy newcomers, the story picks up where ""Fellowship"" left off. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are journeying to Mordor to destroy the world-threatening One Ring. They are joined by the avaricious, reptilian Gollum (an astounding, computer-generated creation, brilliantly voiced by Andy Serkis). 

Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are pursuing Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), who have been kidnapped by orcs... 

The following action is too densely-layered to explain here, which makes the achievement of Jackson and his co-writers all the more impressive. This is a compact, flab-free adaptation of JRR Tolkien's complex, lengthy book, and it suffers little from following three simultaneous adventures.  

The special effects, too, impress. Gollum is the first believable CG character, while the battle of Helm's Deep is one of the finest, most expansive combat sequences ever filmed. 
The cast do well not to be swamped by the spectacle. Mortensen again excels as the square-jawed hero, while Rhys-Davies' dwarf provides welcome comic relief.  

Unfortunately, with his every attempt at sincerity, Wood's Frodo still looks as though he's going to make a pass at his fellow hobbit Sam. However, Astin rises above this to give a standout performance.  

It's his moving delivery of the inspirational, climactic monologue that gives heart to the spectacle and elevates a film it's easy to admire into one it's possible to love."

"Dec 12, 2002",POSITIVE,"The Two Towers es apabullante, no sólo en su épica, sino también en el gigantesco despliegue de recursos."
"Dec 12, 2002",POSITIVE," ""Lord of the Rings"" brings with it a whole set of
              expectations. We've all seen the action figures,
              toys, board games. There's even an LOTR version of
              Risk. This, not to mention the influence of decades
              worth of loyal readers. The way in which you sit down
              to view the film, probably isn't going to be as
              spontaneous and uninformed as ... say, ""Hey honey,
              let's see what's showing on cable tonight."" And those of you
              who have read and enjoyed the book bring not only
              details from it with you, but your own feelings about
              the characters and stories and how they relate to
              you. That said, I did not approach ""The Two Towers"" in
              this manner. I did not read the book. I wasn't all
              that impressed with ""Fellowship."" So
              with only that as a basis, I did not really expect to
              be taken by this second in the trilogy. Enough intro ... here's the review: I found the
              ""Two Towers"" to be rather like two different movies.
              The first half similar to Fellowship: a collection of
              wide spiraling aerial shots of characters in costume
              on horses in front of big mountains. Bland dialogue
              endeavoring to be spoken with great import at every
              word. (Save for Ian McKellen -- who knows exactly how
              it should be spoken.) This part of the film I'd grade
              a ""B-."" The second half far outdoes the first. Here,
              the story broadens to embody several interesting
              lines that develop patiently and maturely. Two
              hobbits in the forest get closely in touch with
              nature in hopes of branching out their existing
              resources. A diseased, spell-ridden, impotent king
              story line that eventually blossoms into a very
              nicely realized battle in defense of Helm's Deep.
              Even a love story of sorts. Some of the images here
              are truly fantastic, breathtaking. This second half
              hovers someplace between a B+/A-. Additionally, the relationship between the ring,
              Frodo and Gollum is by far the most curious. It's
              unfortunate that this story line is underplayed.
              Though, the multi-personality Gollum character is an
              amazing creation. One scene in particular, where he
              debates with himself, the camera capturing as if
              there were two of him; this is one of the film's
              finest moments. Still, I'd suggest his first
              appearance in the film ought have remained
              speechless, since his form is so eerie, silence and
              confusion would have brought a greater tension to
              that moment. The dwarf seems to bear the burden of comic relief
              for the entire film, this works half the time. Though
              Aragorn begins to round out, Gandalf is always
              lovable and the king sparks a bit of interest, still
              the other characters lack fullness. The friendship
              between Sam and Frodo ought to pull at my
              heartstrings; instead, I feel they're actors on a
              stage. The elf and Aragorn have richer camaraderie.
              More properly, Aragorn and his horse. I did enjoy Aragorn's (Viggo) dream sequences with
              Arwen (Liv), and the men on beasts fight scenes were
              pretty darned awesome as well, ditto that Gandalf
              fall sequence. But, the dialogue -- nothing with much
              bite, instead a tendency towards the expository.
              Example: The elf leads an army of trained archers
              pointing out to them the most vulnerable parts of
              armor. He's not saying it for them (they're experts
              too) -- he's saying it for us. Interesting info about Gollum from the
              production notes:
              ""Gollum is a completely digital creature, but I was
              determined that I wanted an actor to actually create
              the character, which in this case is Andy Serkis,""
              says Jackson. The collaboration between creative
              teams and Serkis has resulted in the first character
              of his kind -- an entirely performance-based digital
              creation that ""acts"" as much as any actor in the
              film. As Jackson and Oscar-winning director of
              photographer Andrew Lesnie supervised actor Andy
              Serkis's performance on set, the animators at WETA
              Digital studied the resulting performance to remake
              it digitally, using his movements and facial
              expressions to animate Gollum that would ultimately
              ""act"" in the scene. ""I am so in awe of the skill,
              effort and technical wizardry of the rotoartists,""
              says Serkis. ""The skill of the animators to bring
              this off, and have such passion for it, is quite
              staggering."" His body and voice design was then taken
              further into an animated world through motion capture
              photography, computer generated imagery and digital
              sound mixing. The resulting synthesis is a totally
              new visual effect. ""Obviously, Andy creates the character through the
              voice,"" explains Jackson. ""But also, we're doing a
              lot of Gollum as motion capture, which is when Andy
              wears a suit covered in these little dots, and he
              performs Gollum. He says the dialog, he plays the
              scenes out just as he would, and the computer is able
              to capture his movement, and translate that to the
              digital version of Gollum."" Starting with sketches by
              conceptual artists Howe and Lee along with the art,
              Jackson's vision for Gollum was ultimately sculpted
              into a plasticene maquette which was then scanned
              into the computer. ""There are around 300 different
              muscles or more on Gollum,"" says creature supervisor
              Eric Sainden. ""He has a full skeleton and a full
              muscle system that's all driving what you see on his
              skin. One of Gollum's greatest challenges is his
              face. He has to act with the other actors. The facial
              system we're doing has about 250 different face
              shapes that we're working in between."" Gollum's
              famous voice, one of the most memorable elements of
              both Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings
              trilogy, became Serkis's touchstone and key to the
              character. ""I had an emotional root to that sound,""
              he says. ""For me, it is where his pain is trapped.
              That emotional memory is trapped in that part of his
              body, his throat. In just doing the voice, I
              immediately got into the physicality of Gollum, and
              embodied the part as I would if I were playing it for
              real."""

"Dec 10, 2002",POSITIVE," The second film in Peter Jackson's trilogy of JRR Tolkien's The Lord Of The Rings is one of the year's best. Having introduced the elaborate story and its myriad characters in the much-garlanded first film The Fellowship Of The Ring, Jackson is now free to accelerate the pace of the saga and sink his teeth into real adventure. The result is a thrilling, muscular entertainment which powers along intensely towards the climactic third film - due in the world's theatres this time next year. Box office response will be potent. With the second instalment in the Harry Potter series winding down by the time The Two Towers opens in the US on Dec 18, New Line Cinema and its distribution partners around the world should clean up, coming close to the $860m which the first film generated last Christmas. The home entertainment release of The Fellowship Of The Ring earlier this year should also have sparked up a new audience anxious for part two in addition to die-hard fans. New Line's three-picture strategy may have been a gigantic risk, but it is paying off just as the studio had hoped - turning Jackson's vision into a massive revenue-generating machine, whipping up new consumers as it goes. The Two Towers proves that, for all his skills of imagination and inventiveness, Jackson is most of all a disciplined cinematic storyteller. While the first picture creaked under the weight of all its exposition, the second one eradicates the tedium of Tolkien's prose in favour of fast-moving action. Awards bodies are unlikely to reward it with the same zeal as they did its predecessor, but there is no director as worthy this year as Jackson who injects The Two Towers with a different, more urgent energy that vibrantly elucidates the book's majestic themes of good versus evil and nature versus industry. And then there's Gollum - a troubled, deformed hobbit whose own schizophrenic character embodies the struggle between the good of the hobbits with the evil of the ring. Gollum was acted and voiced by UK actor Andy Serkis but then digitally animated using the actor's movements and facial expressions. Whether Serkis is eligible for Oscar consideration or not, his Gollum is as compelling a creation as the combination of man and CGI has yet produced on screen. Sort of ET meets Scooby-Doo, the character is set to become an audience favourite as Yoda did in the second Star Wars film The Empire Strikes Back. As had happened at the end of the first film, the fellowship has been splintered into three groups. Hobbits Frodo (Wood) and Sam (Astin) march on to Mordor alone in their quest to destroy the ring; Aragorn (Mortensen), Legolas (Bloom) and Gimli (Rhys-Davies) roam across Middle Earth in pursuit of a band of Uruk-hai who have abducted the other two hobbits Merry (Monaghan) and Pippin (Boyd). Frodo and Sam are immediately attacked by Gollum, an old hobbit formerly known as Smeagol, who has been deformed in body and mind by 500 years in possession of the ring. They overcome Gollum and persuade him to take them to the gates of Mordor, although he is only concerned with being near the ring which he calls his ""Precious"". Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli meanwhile enter the kingdom of Rohan which is being beseiged by armies of Uruks. The king Theoden (Hill) has been bewitched by Saruman (Lee) and his rule is being overtaken by his evil advisor Wormtongue (Dourif); with the help of a resurrected Gandalf, now The White (McKellen), the three eject Wormtongue and reinstate Theoden, who decides that he and his people should take refuge at the country's fortress Helm's Deep. Aragorn meanwhile takes a fancy to Theoden's niece Eowyn (Otto) and his elf love Arwen (Tyler) takes the opportunity to leave him and join the Elvish exodus to the land of the immortals. Merry and Pippin escape their captors and flee into Fangorn Forest where they are befriended by an all-talking, all-walking tree called Treebeard (also voiced by Rhys-Davies). The three-hour film culminates in a stupendous battle at Helm's Deep as the men of Rohan attempt to fend off an army of Uruks. Epic, vivid and violent, the battle is also prolonged and bloody and could prove boring to those who weary of relentless on-screen combat. The production is, of course, sumptuous, and the effects seamless; a new song called Gollum's Song written by Howard Shore and co-screenwriter/co-producer Fran Walsh accompanies the end credits with haunting vocals by Emiliana Torrini.

"Dec 9, 2002",POSITIVE,"A deeply conflicted picture that soars when it works, and plods along sincerely when it doesn't."
"Dec 7, 2002",POSITIVE,An epic of grandeur and scale that's been decades gone from the popcorn pushing sound stages of Hollywood.
"Dec 6, 2002",POSITIVE," First the good news: The Two Towers isn’t necessarily better than The Fellowship of the Ring but everything great about the first film has been dutifully amplified here to umpteenth degrees. Now the bad: everything less than stellar about the first film has also been magnified. Director Peter Jackson’s understanding of J.R.R. Tolkien’s crucial themes is still near transcendent—if The Fellowship of the Ring was alive with Christian hope, then Two Towers is dignified by an impressive and overwhelming sense of godlessness. Two Towers may be the most sinister Hollywood epic ever made, a stirring account of lands on the brink of desiccation. Two Towers is the most structurally audacious part of Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings trilogy. The author daringly recounted the exploits of Aragorn, Elf archer Legolas, Gimli the Dwarf and hobbits Merry and Pippin throughout the first half of his Two Towers. It’s not until book four that Tolkien tells the story of Frodo and Sam’s journey through the Hills of Emyn Muil with Gollum/Smeagol. For the film, Jackson has predictably chosen to crosscut between the three separate narratives. The rhythm with which Jackson weaves in and out of the separate stories is incredibly lyrical and emphasizes the distance between the split Fellowship. Sadly, though, this episodic structure compromises one particular thread: Merry and Pippin’s encounter with the wise Treebeard. Tolkien delicately evokes Treebeard’s wisdom and contemplates all sorts of complex relationships between Ents, trolls, wizards and other inhabitants of Middle-earth throughout the first part of Two Towers. An hour or two in, Jackson’s film comes to resemble a prolonged movie trailer. However remarkable the tone may be, the brevity of individual scenes and constant crosscutting undermines the significance of Ent history and Treebeard’s overall tenderness and wisdom. In the end, Treebeard has been reduced to a mere oddity, a mostly CG creation that shares Gimli’s comedic shtick (both characters are brought to life by John Rhys-Davies). There is one bright side: all is forgiven once the Ents take to Isengard and their awe-inspiring battle with Saruman’s forces is intercut with the jaw-dropping Uruk-hai attack on Helm’s Deep. Jackson wastes no time thrusting audiences into the book’s action. The film begins with what appears to be a recap of Gandalf’s encounter with Balrog only to reveal itself as a dream of sorts. Jackson implements a career’s worth of aerial shots and dramatic overheads throughout Two Towers, but his remarkable use of long shot truly evokes the majestic scope of Tolkien’s fantasia. Just as he did in Fellowship of the Ring, Jackson has an uncanny ability to amplify key Tolkien conceits. Liv Tyler still looks like she’s lost in an Australian douche commercial but, in one ravishing flash forward, Jackson contemplates her character’s immortal coil and devastating relationship to the world and people around her. In this one scene, hope springs eternal and when the people of Rivendell charge majestically toward Helm’s Deep, it’s as if Jackson is saying the world isn’t done yet. In moving key events from the book over to the third film (mainly Gandalf’s encounter with Saruman and the attack at Shelob’s lair), Jackson undervalues both Saruman and Grima Wormtongue (the director falls into the easy trap of giving the character a pale, glazed-over look to signify his evil). Also, the film ends less intimately than it should and more as a cliffhanger—as such, purists may feel a tad cheated. In a lame attempt to give Cate Blanchett a second’s worth of screen time, Jackson has Galadriel the circus ringleader waltz into frame in order to recount key events from the film’s first two hours for anyone who may not have been paying close attention. Despite the often busy crosscutting, Jackson has stunningly staged Two Towers as a series of exorcisms. Surely Jackson’s remarkable authentication of Gollum’s every vice and smidgen of goodness must count as a small miracle considering the character is an all-CG creation. The film’s greatest strength is how Jackson brings to life the haunting conflict between Gollum and Smeagol. Jackson evokes the split between personalities most fabulously with a tree bisecting the film’s frame. Of course, Andy Serkis’s performance here is also crucial to the success of these scenes. Sam (Sean Astin) doubts Gollum but Frodo (Elijah Wood) believes in the diseased monster’s ability to do good and give himself completely to Smeagol. Wood’s casting makes more sense than ever—it is in his clammy white skin and big eyes that we see a future Gollum in the making. The sadness with which Gollum teases and consumes Smeagol once again reinforces Jackson’s blistering vision of a pervasive evil threatening to destroy all that is good in the world. Despite the film’s flaws, it is the way in which Jackson summons the threat of Middle-earth’s potential destruction that energizes and ennobles the film. This evil is so palpable it even brings Wormtongue to tears. Fanboys and fangirls should also be reduced to cowering messes. Ed Gonzalez is the co-founder of Slant Magazine.

The film went on to nab six Oscar nominations at the 75th Academy Awards. The Hollywood Reporter’s original review is below. Well on its way to becoming one of the greatest achievements in cinema history with last year’s Oscar-winning first installment, filmmaker Peter Jackson’s grand realization of The Lord of the Rings epic by J.R.R. Tolkien continues with The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. The much-anticipated New Line release is destined to rule the holiday season box office and rival the first film’s theatrical earnings of $860 million worldwide. While it’s not likely to spellbind Academy members enough to muster the 13 Oscar nominations that The Fellowship of the Ring received, the three-hour fantasy adventure has a good shot at being the first best picture-nominated sequel released a year after the original since The Bells of St. Mary’s 57 years ago. Meanwhile, some who found Fellowship a ponderous opening act will be happier with the quickened pace and expanded scope of Towers. For those familiar with the 1,300-page book that has been marketed as a trilogy since the 1960s, the present film is assurance that next year’s Return of the King should be a truly glorious event. Indeed, assuming the better and longer “extended” version of Fellowship released last month on video is not a fluke, sometime in 2004 the unabridged Lord of the Rings will join very few other masterworks destined to stand up for decades and hopefully bring good fortune to all involved in its making. No character puts on the ring of power in Towers, and there’s no summation of the first film to explain its importance, but the increasingly heavy and dangerous burden carried by the hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) and the mission to destroy it is still the hope of the free peoples of Middle Earth on the eve of a great war. The title refers to Orthanc — the stronghold of treacherous wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) — and Barad-dur, the fortress of the dark lord Sauron. The latter is unable to take human form but exists as a giant fiery eye. Towers follows several story lines that introduce new characters, take the viewer to new parts of Middle Earth and, except for one, build to thunderous climaxes that moviegoers will long remember. What has taken thousands of artisans to forge cannot easily be summed up in one review. The performances continue to be richer and more satisfying than one expects in such a fantastic tale; the special effects, including two wonderful new CGI characters, are simply tremendous; the pacing is tighter than Fellowship, though they are the same length (still, one can imagine the extended Towers running even longer than the 208-minute video version of Fellowship). Along with the corrosive yet crucially helpful Gollum (Andy Serkis) — a Hobbit warped and driven mad by possessing the One Ring for hundreds of years — Towers presents another amazing CGI character in Treebeard (voiced by John Rhys-Davies), one of the race of Ents. While Frodo goes against the wishes of Sam and others in keeping Gollum alive — providing a central drama that subtly builds a relationship that will come to a world-saving climax in Return — Treebeard with the help of captured Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) gathers his kind for an assault on Saruman. Very tall and more tree than human, though he walks and talks like one, Treebeard is older than Gandalf and reluctant to battle Sauron’s forces until he sees the massacre of trees ordered by Saruman in the first film. What may sound like a subplot involving the Knights Who Say “Ni!” is rendered so carefully as to achieve its potential as one of the most magical and heroic parts of Rings. But Towers has many battles, starting with the opening sequence of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) locked in combat with the fiery Balrog, from the first film, in a dazzling plunge into the depths of the Earth. Gandalf does return from his ordeal, though changed and focused on the coming war. All of the returning characters continue to evolve, including an outright mystical sequence showing the Eldar/Edain union and future of elf Arwen (Liv Tyler) and human Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), which the filmmakers went to the appendix of Rings to find for the midway point of the whole work. The major event of Towers is the battle of Helm’s Deep, in which Aragorn, Gimli the dwarf (Rhys-Davies) and elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom) join the horselords of Rohan in a seemingly doomed fight against Saruman’s army of 10,000 Uruk-hai, Orcs and Easterlings. But first Gandalf has to help revive King Theoden (Bernard Hill), who has fallen under the spell of Saruman and his wicked ally Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). Other heroic Rohirrim include sister and brother Eowyn (Miranda Otto) and Eomer (Karl Urban), who is banished by the possessed Theoden. Eowyn falls for Aragorn, but wants most to fight. She gets her chance in one of the great clashes to come in Return. As for the assault on Helm’s Deep, made possible through the astounding special effects and live-action filming that reportedly took months, it’s an amazing thing to behold. Overall, from the brief glimpses of Oliphants (giant elephant-like creatures employed by Sauron’s forces, returning in a big way in the next movie) and the Nazgul (or Ringwraiths), now mounted on fell flying creatures, to the Wargs (Orc mounts that are a mixture of three animals) and those revengeful Ents, Towers is a cinematic flood of spectacular proportions."
