"Mar 24, 2024",POSITIVE,Love all Robert's films. This one is no different.
"Mar 23, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Pretty good photography, not much of a story, liked the trippy Norse mythology stuff could have made a bit more of it."
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"If The Northman isn't Robert Eggers' best movie, it's at least his boldest. It's finetuned and pinpoint beyond what you'd expect from an already exacting director, and the stunning ensemble cast is entirely dedicated to their profound roles ‚Äì all led by Alexander Skarsg√•rd and Anya Taylor-Joy.

"Mar 12, 2024",POSITIVE,"Beautiful story of revenge, very raw emotion, and an all around great Viking movie!! Alexander Skarsg√•rd absolutely delivers in this and put so much into this and the supporting cast also holds up this captivating tale. A must see for anyone who is into Viking lore or a fan of Alexander Skarsg√•rd."
"Mar 5, 2024",POSITIVE,"Almost like a classic Sword and Sorcerer film, but with no regard for the genre's conventions, which makes this film stand-out, and stand above."
"Feb 29, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Mediocre. Pretty basic story, nothing really surprising or departure from what you'd expect. Forgettable"
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"What a great surprise! Immersed in the beautiful and creative shoots, I really loved this movie. This movie made me remember why I love movies this much and inspired me in my cinematography."
"Feb 27, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I do not  see what the critics see in this. Even with great cinematography, it was not good."
"Feb 21, 2024",POSITIVE,Eggers finally fulfills the promise he showed in his earlier work. A gorgeous and bold epic that both feels old fashioned (possibly ancient even) and excitingly new.
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Because of it's length, lack of character development or even story depth, it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you look at it from a different perspective than you usually look at movies, you appreciate it for what it is: a brutal revenge tale with great cinematography."
"Feb 9, 2024",POSITIVE,"In a landscape that's been very fond of Vikings in recent years, it's nice to see a departure from the often poorly realised historical, and instead venture into the mythical, the fantastical.

Based on the story of Amleth, the original inspiration for Shakespear's Hamlet, this film is unapologetically cryptic and mysterious, while telling a cohesive and thrilling tale.

The wealth of historical accuracies to the time period are worth 5 stars in themselves (Seriously, look it up), but going into this film expect to see a work of fantasy and let yourself get lost in it. You won't be disappointed."
"Feb 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This movie was absolutely dreadful from start to finish. The writing was completely incoherent and nonsensical. None of the plot threads made any sense whatsoever. The attempts at symbolism fell completely flat. The tone shifted abruptly and inconsistently between scenes. It honestly felt like the writer was just making things up as they went along with no planning or forethought.

Even setting aside the abysmal writing, every other aspect of this movie was equally incompetent. The acting was laughably bad. The cinematography was amateurish. The pacing was horrible. The runtime was absurdly long considering there was no actual story being told. The whole production comes across as some film student's first attempt at an ""artistic"" movie that tries way too hard to be profound but ends up revealing only its own pretension.

The Northman has earned its place among the worst movies I have ever seen. The writing is the most glaring weakness, but every single component is flawed. Do not waste your time or money on this total disaster of a film. Easily one of the biggest cinematic misfires in recent memory."
"Feb 4, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Apparently, some reviewers think a pretty movie must be a good movie.  This one is visually sumptuous, but plagued by long boring stretches, the worst choreographed medieval fight scenes since movies in the 50's, moderate acting (Nicole Kidman barely shows up), too long, some goofiness that is hard to take seriously in a movie that wants oh so bad to be serious.   Never mind that the writers only read the Cliff Notes about Vikings.  I give it two stars because I am a sucker for a Viking movie."
"Jan 29, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Like all of Eggers' films, if you don't fully understand the lore, you'll likely be stuck at times. Although mostly good, I think it may be Eggers' weakest film yet. üçÖ"
"Jan 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"Cinematography is crispy epic combined with crafty engaging storytelling, now this is a f≈Øcking viking movie folks! Sk√•l!!!"
"Jan 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"After being blown away by The VVitch and then seeing the masterpiece that is The Lighthouse, I knew that Eggers' had something special with The Northman. A fantastical epic about revenge and death, this film is a visual marvel that hooked me instantly. Amazing performances, interesting story, and brutal fight scenes have me rating this one a 4/5 stars. Brilliant film."
"Jan 18, 2024",NEGATIVE,Probably the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Weak plot and horrible acting. Even the special effects lame . Don't waste your time on this disaster. Fooled by the high rotten tomato's rating. Don't believe it.
"Jan 16, 2024",POSITIVE,"Prepare for a tale of vikings, vengeance and the road to vallhalla! When Prince Amleth's father is murdered by his uncle, he embarks on a quest of vengeance against the traitor who killed his father. Beautiful in its aesthetic and brutal in its violence, Eggars brings the world of Norse mythology to life!"
"Jan 13, 2024",POSITIVE,"Absolutely gorgeous, stunning on every way."
"Jan 12, 2024",NEGATIVE,I was thoroughly unimpressed.
"Jan 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,Unbelievably bad! Don‚Äôt waste your time. 
"Jan 3, 2024",POSITIVE,Movie was awesome! If you liked Conan the Barbarian from the 80's with Arnold then you will enjoy this. The action is great and the mythos is excellent. Alexander is good in this movie along with the supporting cast. It really made me feel like I was watching Arnold's Conan from the 80's! Worth watch for sure!
"Jan 2, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Great cast. 
Movie ‚Äî- meh x 10"
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,"Very likely the greatest viking movie that will ever be made. Exciting, emotional, authentic. I am entertained with every repeat viewing."
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,Very long and mostly boring. The Northman tribal scene way too long and stretched out. A lot of unnecessary filler and repeated dream scenes. Then the final fight on top of an active volcano where the sulfurous fumes and heat would kill any living thing but it these two‚Ä¶. They kill each other. Story line runs along most Viking movies but movie did have hope of the didn‚Äôt stretch it out so long. 
"Dec 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I have NO idea why this movie has high ratings.  It is 95% generic filler from any generic Vikings movie, and the remaining 5% is a script that a 12 year old could have written.  Is it that ANYONE will watch -- and fear to criticize -- a movie with the massive clan of Skarsg√•rds in it??  ANY SINGLE EPISODE of the Vikings series is better than this waste of time."
"Dec 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,Viking slasher kits. How are Vikings portrayed in this movie? Every second someone gets butchered by a brutal Viking. After 30 minutes we were laughing about the stupidity of it all. The artificial kits acting and the butchering was getting really annoying and we were laughing because everything was so overdone.
"Dec 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,One of the worst movies I have watched. Bad story and bad acting.
"Dec 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"A beautiful film, with brilliant protagonists and a well written plot. The Northman is a must watch for fans of Norse mythology."
"Dec 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,Good but not great. There are some parts midway and at the end that just makes no sense at all. Really detracted from a solid movie. Overall I liked this movie.
"Dec 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not as good as the director's The Lighthouse but it does a great job of showing Norse mythology and mysticism. Definitely one of the best film about Vikings, if not the best."
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great revenge movie. Looks beautiful as one has come to expect from a Robert Egger film. Acting is good, score is superb. It can drag at times but I wasn't able to take my eyes off the screen. A true representation of viking life as you can get (I presume). Anyone who is into norse mythology and all that stuff will enjoy this."
"Dec 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie bit slow at times.
"Nov 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Well shot. good characters decent score
"Nov 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was pretty bored watching this. Yeah the action is cool and scenes felt epic, but at the end of the day I didnt care and it wasnt memorable."
"Nov 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"A revenge movie that is violent, brutal and bloody with a stunning cinematography. This is probably one of my favorite movies of 2022."
"Nov 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Maybe not the worst movie ever made but with every minute that goes by, one is convinced that it's characters and director are desperately trying to reach that mark"
"Nov 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Disappointing. A cinematic masterpiece, authentic to the age - ultimately boring and will be forgotten in two minutes thanks to a lack of ANY real relationships between any characters whatsoever. Not one character with an actual personality - just some cardboard cut outs reciting overwrought lines in heavy accents for two hours. Mostly tedious."
"Nov 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'm really concerned that professional critics gave it a good review. I have lost faith in rotten tomatoes. 
Just a bad movie for every reason."
"Nov 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not good...really not good at all. Plot was subpar. Boring. Slow burn without the suspense, depth, or profundity which would be needed to make it interesting.  Making something slow doesn't make it more deep or meaningful. In this case it's an absolute snooze with no payoff.   I rarely feel like I get nothing from a movie and that it was a complete waste of time but this was one of those cases."
"Nov 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"They should rename this movie to the SOUTHman for how quickly this movie went south. 

A glorified snoozer. Skarsg√•rd has an absolute rig, though."
"Oct 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,You can barely tell what the characters are saying. The plot is all over the place and in the end the hero and villain dies would recommend to my worst enemy
"Oct 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"A revenge movie is nothing new, but this is something else. Brutal and bloody, and at times beautiful, this effort does comes as a sort of modern day Shakespeare.
One of 2022's best movies."
"Sep 28, 2023",POSITIVE,I love this movie and i love this era
"Sep 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,i watched this movie for anya taylor joy. I did not care so much for the manly men doing manly stuff and making manly guttural noises. it was alright.
"Sep 11, 2023",POSITIVE,The Northman was pretty solid.
"Sep 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I've heard this is good, so I'm quite looking forward to it but I have a suspicion I might just find it a bit try-hard in its authenticity.

Hmmm.  Having watched it, I'm not sure quite what I thought of it - it's diverting, but takes itself a bit too seriously, particularly considering how silly a lot of it is.  It's the age-old tale of someone done wrong and putting things right in a kinda quest-y way with ""stuff"" happening along the way.  I have to say it didn't half go on (136 minutes) - I was totally ""get a move on"" for a large chunk of this film and I suspected I knew exactly how it was going to end from the first minute (and I wasn't far wrong - not that I really cared by that point).

I didn't love this and I didn't hate it - but having finished it, a lot of the comments I found I'd made whilst watching it were on the negative side.  A lot of it is very dark - not in mood, but in visibility (which actually hasn't been a big problem this year so far).  There are also a lot of silly accents involved (some of which are more consistent than others) and it's surprisingly wordy for what's described as a ""brutal Viking saga"" (and it spends too much time using old Norse (or something!) subtitles - we all know that's what they spoke all the time, so don't pretend they only did it when they were angry).  There was also far, far too much shouting at the sky going on and a silly number of heads being chopped off.

It does, however, always look very good.  It's well filmed (apparently Robert Eggers can be relied upon here, but this is the first of his films I've seen) - whilst it might have shared roots with Hamlet, but I was very much reminded of this version of Macbeth - it's not in black and white, but it shares a lot of the same style (when you can see what's going on).  Additionally, the scenery is beautiful - I have a strong suspicion that Iceland was heavily involved (Wikipedia tells me it was, but most of it was actually filmed in Northern Ireland).  I suspect the cast probably didn't overly enjoy the filming experience though -  there's a lot of wandering about in the mud or the sea involved.

And it's got a very impressive cast indeed - there's a lot of well-known names involved in this.  Possibly, one might argue, too many well-known names without them necessarily knowing what to do with them.  Alexander Skarsgard certainly isn't underused though - and he does a decent job, but he was unlucky considering he has just come off playing Matsson in Succession and it does feel at times that this role is just a much earlier version of that (here, he's a Viking disrupter).  Of the rest of the cast, I'd say Anja Taylor-Joy comes over the best for me - it's also funny seeing Klaes Bang playing ""The Prick"" but in Viking times, as opposed to more modern times.  But when you look at some of the other names involved (Nicole Kidman, Ethan Hawke, Willem DaFoe, Bjork and various other recognisable faces), it's hard not to feel they were a bit wasted.

All of which sounds a bit negative about the film, doesn't it?  Maybe I'm being harsh because it certainly looked good and it ""felt"" good - but when I actually thought about what it was doing, it wasn't entirely clear what it contained.  It's also very hard to describe what genre it falls into - horror? action? thriller? drama?  It all felt a bit ""style over substance"" which didn't stand up to close inspection for me - maybe I just shouldn't have inspected it so closely.   So, if you want to watch it, just try to do so without thinking about it too much and you can currently stream it on Sky or rent it in any of the usual locations."
"Sep 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"I found it refreshingly different.  If your looking for a epic like the show ""Vikings"", nope this isn't a transgenerational saga like that.  It's a one man's journey of a spiritual reckoning n revenge, only to find that he wasted his time seeking revenge. When he could have had family n life.  Then again it wouldn't be able to draw on the theology and historical story that created the imagery n Amleth path in the first place."
"Sep 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Hamlet with Nordic names sprinkled in. Don't believe me? Amleth is just Hamlet with the ""h"" moved to the end, jester friend's skull makes an appearance, uncle kills dad and mom's in on the whole affair‚Ä¶yeah. No one has peripheral vision and the plot holes could sink Atlantis."
"Aug 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The Northman 

This historical thriller sees the protagonist‚ÄîAmleth, a Viking prince, as he journeys to exert revenge on the man who usurped his father's throne after killing him.

The Northman is visceral with a consistently grim tone.

There's a lot to praise about The Northman, from the brilliant direction of Robert Eggers to the performances given by the cast. The cinematography is also a marvel; the world painted here is striking, and enlivened with brute action and a killer score.

The subject matter in The Northman may be hackneyed and probably isn't driven by a lot of character development but as a whole, it is an utter Viking movie.

7.5/10"
"Aug 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I just couldn't get into it.  Compared to Game of Thrones, this movie was a Neanderthal violent movie.  Kind of corny."
"Aug 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely horrible movie. If you wish to waste any time watching it shame on you.
I found out the hard way by watching this mess."
"Aug 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Absolute rubbish. Save yourself 2 hours and never turn it on. Could have been really good with the actors involved but is utter crap. Can't believe I stayed with it till the end thinking it may get better
"Aug 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great film, the most historically accurate viking film yet !!!"
"Aug 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"Those who have read Norse mythology, and epic tales of Vikings will absolutely love this movie. No soft shit just straight viking"
"Aug 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"God I couldn't take it after 30 minutes. Too pretentious and over the top. There's no depth to the characters and the dialogues were lacking. 2.5 hours of Vikings preying, howling, and rage screaming. Cliche stuff."
"Aug 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Not the best story line, unless you like stories to not pan out like you thought they would."
"Aug 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Slow start.  The story line is laughable and unrealistic.  He goes his entire life waiting for the opportunity to avenge his father & free his mother, by killing his uncle. Yet he disappoints at every opportune time.  Just no!"
"Aug 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"The part I read before posting has to do with your mindest.  To be honest, this is a great revenge tale movie.  The gore and sex doesn't in my mind detract from what could be called the John Wick of the Nordic realm!"
"Aug 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"An original and engrossing take on the revenge tale that does not follow common cinematic tropes. Well executed and structured with an amazing score and breathtakingly shot. This film has some quirks and some oddities woven in, but what is on display is original and very engaging and enticing. Great twists in the narrative and a satisfying climax. The acting and accents engross you in the Scandinavian/Viking life and the scenery (especially in Iceland) is incredibly captivating. Some of the long tracking and action sequences are equally impressive. Some of the visual effects and action sequences were lacking though, but this did not diminish how the film lands overall.

"Aug 5, 2023",POSITIVE,Fantastic film. It deserves so much more praise. More films like this should be made nowadays.
"Aug 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Poor scripting, bad visual effects, and a surprisingly bad performance from Hawke make this cheap Viking movie more of a knockoff than a knockout."
"Jul 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing. Better with each watch. 
"Jul 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Lacks originality. For all the uncle killing the king and the son coming back to Avenge the father plots we have seen‚Ä¶you would think they could've  done better. Besides the obvious‚Ä¶avenge my father theme‚Ä¶the story sucks. Does someone actually watch this at the end and think ""oh this is great"". Impossible"
"Jul 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I was looking forward to watching this but ended up being disappointed. This would've been way better as a limited series or something. With certain events in the beginning happening so fast to set the stage for vengeance, it just didn't give time for one to feel any meaningful emotion towards REALLY craving justice. And this film clearly wants you to crave it in a special way with how the main character is. The fighting (regarding the main character) didn't have much impact like it should either in my opinion. There's plenty of movies out there where the hero is fighting and you find yourself tensed up or squeezing your leg without knowing it at first. I didn't get that with this movie which made it awkward because I wanted to. Sure there's blood and gore but I think it was an issue with the fighting choreographer or lackluster stunt actors. [SPOILERS AHEAD] And my biggest gripe was after all the stuff the main character went through to get his strength built up, the rage, the drive, the weird magic he took part in, and everything else...ALL of that to end with him having a fatal draw at the end against a dude who wasn't even in his prime anymore and kinda overpowered him most of the fight. It just felt like a major letdown with hardly any satisfaction."
"Jul 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This was your typical sundance type of film, usually if it has that label its going to be horrible. Angles? Terrible. Story? The idea of the plot is good but overall the details in between and how to get there? Terrible. The only good part of this movie is him adopting the mantra he had of saving his mother and avenging his father, made for some badass moments. But overall just a horrendous movie in every way possible."
"Jul 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"La verdad debo reconocer que esto es por mucho la mejor pel√≠cula de acci√≥n del 2022. Pero m√°s agreguale una dosis de mucha brutalidad, muertes y gore. Aunque la historia sea un cliche, su ejecuci√≥n fue perfecta. Una historia de promesa/venganza que termina con muchas muertes. Debo reconocer que para ser otro de los mejores proyectos del director Robert Eggers (quien tambi√©n dirigio The Witch y El Faro), este proyecto es una joya unica. Los actores cumplen bien sus papeles. Excelente vestuario, escenarios y sobre todo las escenas de peleas y gore son de lo mejor. La m√∫sica ayuda mucho al desarrollo de la pel√≠cula. Y el final: uffff √∫nico. 

CONCLUSI√ìN: The Northman es sin duda alguna una pel√≠cula que debes ver en tu vida, si eres fan√°tico de las historias oscuras y tragicas pero con mucha brutalidad y gore. Si ya viste algunos de los trabajos de Robert Eggers, este proyecto te encantar√°. Es injusto que fracasar√° en taquilla. Pero vale la pena verla. 
CALIFICACI√ìN: 10/10. Simplemente otro excelente proyecto brutal"
"Jul 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Woof. Wouldn't waste over two hours watching this hard to follow, baseless story line. The fantasy aspect makes this movie a reach and takes away from what the story could have been. Half a star is generous."
"Jul 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Yes, this is Viking Hamlet.  Yes, it's awesome.  A few of the artistic choices of the director will turn some people off to it but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and loved how practical the sets and stunts were.  I highly recommend this underrated movie and wish there were more like it."
"Jul 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"really like Shakespeare and I have always been fascinated by the ancient Vikings.... Well The Northman is a Viking version of Shakespeare's Hamlet. A very dark version and of course Vikings will be Vikings, so this is a very violent, and very bloody movie.... on a grand cinematic scale!
Young Prince Amleth is about to become a man when his father, King Aurvandilis (Ethan Hawke) is brutally murdered in front him by his uncle Fjolnir. (Claes Bang) Fjolnir then kidnaps his mother, takes over the kingdom, and sends assassins to kill Amleth.
Amleth must flee his home, his land, and his mother. He barely escapes and he swears vengeance on Fjolnir and everyone that has wronged him and his family.
""I will avenge you father. I will save you mother. I will kill you Fjolnir "" - Amleth
Amleth begins a bloody hate-driven quest to kill his uncle Fjolnir. He embraces hate and anger, evil and vengeance... so much so that his vision becomes blurred. He is obsessed with hate for his uncle and killing him and everyone that stands in his way.
""I Am Amleth The Bear-Wolf, Son Of King Aurvandill The War Raven. And I Am His Vengeance!"" - Amleth
This movie holds nothing back. It is visually detailed in a brutally violent, bloody mess.... And the film is almost unapologetic about it, in a Viking sort of way. I mean it is Vikings. That is what Vikings do.
The movie is just beautifully shot and the actors are just amazing: Nicole Kidman, Alexander Skarsg√•rd, Ethan Hawke, William Dafoe, Bj√∂rk, Anya Taylor-Joy
If you like Shakespeare's Hamlet and you do not mind all the blood and violence, you will like ""The Northman"" but even if you don't know the story of Hamlet it is a really good Viking movie"
"Jul 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A very grounded and realistic take on Vikings and north mythology. The music is a real standout in the film, and so is the acting from Alexander Skarsg√•rd and Anya Taylor-Joy. But I would also say that this film was a bit of a drag with its run time."
"Jul 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"A compelling and frequently brutal insight into the lives and spiritual beliefs of early medieval north-western (i.e. Germanic) Europeans. The cinematography is outstanding and the acting is excellent, the story may feel familiar - it's drawn from the same folk history as is Hamlet and the director was inspired by 80s cult masterpiece Conan the Barbarian - but the telling is masterful."
"Jul 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The beginning sets up an emotional struggle that promises to be an interesting premise, but ultimately falls under its own weight, especially towards the end."
"Jul 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,artsy war film. people are going to go into this film thinking its gladiator its not‚Ä¶. great cinematography and acting but it is slow at times with some action scenes i really enjoyed it but it may be too artsy for some.
"Jul 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"A little slow in the middle, but good story and more original than I expected.  Nice twist"
"Jun 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"The Northman transports us to a world both ancient and timeless, where dark tales of honor and revenge unfold against a backdrop of awe-inspiring landscapes and evocative atmospheres. From the first frame to the last, Eggers' directorial prowess is evident, as he flawlessly weaves together a complex tapestry of emotions, stunning visuals, and captivating storytelling."
"Jun 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Awful. Who fights naked with swords next to molten lava & goes totally unscathed from the volcanic heat? It's laughable.
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"A visionary, mesmerizing film. Breathtaking shots combined with a manic attention to detail typical of the director, where no historical detail has been overlooked. Intriguing, epic and profound. 10/10"
"Jun 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If you are a fan of Robert Eggers you already know his films either make you think the characters are on drugs or you are. In this film he removes that wonder. It's the characters. This is an epic revenge movie with plenty of action along side some trippy ass moments. Eggers takes a step away from horror to make what feels like an accurate portrayal of what life was like during the time of Vikings.

This movie didn't hit me until the following day. I wait a day to review any movie I watch as it is but this one in particular settled in my soul while I slept. It's a dark and twisted ride that needed to marinate. Don't go into this film thinking you are going to watch a text book style period piece. Go into this film with an open mind or better yet, a sedated one!"
"Jun 13, 2023",POSITIVE,Badass movie. One of the very few movies that i actually bough on DVD. 10/10 recommend
"Jun 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"I will never forgive the world for allowing this film to flop. The Northman is a great film full of great action, history, and it is a great display of the artistry that film should. This film has something to say and we should all listen. The actors are well directed and clearly gave their all. My only complaint is that Willem Dafoe did not have more screen time."
"Jun 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,Enjoyable (mostly)... artistic I suppose... really violent... looks good in UHD on OLED.
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"There's some really rough parts to watch for more sensitive audiences (this one pulls NO punches), but the acting is compelling, the cinematography and symbolism are exquisite, and the ending fits the tone of the rest of the film's story.

Some bits were a little overdrawn (Avenge, Save, Kill didn't need to be repeated a dozen times for us to get the point).  I had to question what I just watched but not in an offended or horrified way.  Overall: worth a sit!"
"Jun 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"6.7/10 ‚Äî ""Decent""/""Worth Watching""

-(Seen on 6/2/23)"
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,The worst movie I seen In a long time. I. Watched on advice of critics‚Ä¶terrible. Don't waste your time.  Painful.
"May 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"this is a 5 star movie, no doubt!
What a production! Great cast, great direction and a very interesting way to tell this tale."
"May 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Good movie, bloody, violent, trippy, I really enjoyed the use of ""magic"" or ""mythology"" to aid in the story. Went in with no expectations and feel very satisfied with the outcome"
"May 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Wow. That was brutal but entertaining with a great twist at the end.
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,I've been watching a lot of viking era tv shows and movies lately. The Northman just didn't hit the spot for me that I wanted it to. The story was just too confusing for casual watching.
"May 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Good photography, the rest is so boring"
"May 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The very end sword battle confirmed my opinion of a movie with some good moments, and some moments of too much of a Hollywood touch."
"May 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Interesting movie but tried too hard to air a statement.   Sometime less is more.   Def watchable and good production, lots of thought and build well. I feel apocalypto did it better though."
"May 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really good film, I was expecting more action from the film, but that was on me being assumptive not the film. 
For what it is, and what they are trying to do its a fantastic film, with a mixture of reality and what can be dream scenes which I suppose are to be interpreted as either a hallucinations or real mythological happenings.
I like that it is not explained as it does incentivise rewatching the film."
"May 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I checked this out in a movie trailer before I saw the movie I came for and it looked very interesting. I heard good reviews for it, but I never thought much about it. One boring night and after seeing a movie with Anya Taylor Joy I decided to finally check this out. 

Set during the time of the Vikings, Amleth son of King Aurvandill narrowly escapes his life after his wicked uncle Fjlonir murders and claims the throne. Having grown to manhood and ferocious as a warrior in his own right chooses to return as a slave to avenge his father the king. With the help of a Russian slave witch and his experiences with fighting and with advice of witches and wizards he finally gets a chance to fulfill his promise to avenge his father and so much more.

I saw this trailer, but nothing prepared me for how good this was. It was like a Nordic version of Conan the Barbarian with phenomenal storytelling, acting, sets, costumes, etc. Alexander Skarsgard was great, masculine and powerful presence. Anya Taylor Joy was mesmerizing both physically and charismatic. The other actors, Nicole Kidman, Ethan Hawke, Willem Dafoe were also splendid. This was a great movie."
"Apr 30, 2023",POSITIVE,Anya Taylor Joy carried
"Apr 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is a very slow boring film. The casting outside of the lead didn't work and the plot was awful.
"Apr 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Eggers is the new Aronosky, which means you either hate or love this film. I liked it."
"Apr 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"Authentic, well acted, attention grabbing"
"Apr 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"After a couple of excellent low-budget movies (The Witch, The Lighthouse), director Robert Eggers tackles big-budget action in The Northman and, while it's not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, it certainly proves that big is not always better.  Set in the late 10th century, it is a bloody tale of revenge as Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard) sets out on the single-minded task of avenging the murder of his father.  While it has many of the attributes of its predecessors, including clever camerawork, interesting lighting, excellent period details, dark themes, and fascinating locations, it does feel as though it drags at times, thanks primarily to its obsessive fascination with the mythology of the time and the associated rituals.  The Northman feels like a really good movie that should have been great, but got bogged down in the details."
"Apr 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Has been actors trying to stay relevant. No depth. Bad acting. No real storyline.  Cinematography bad.
"Apr 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Highly watchable, but deeply flawed.  Characters do some really stupid things to keep the story moving along.  After Robert Egger's Fascinating The VVitch and visceral The Lighthouse, I expected a much smarter script.

The Northman is full of ""Why would they do that!?"" moments.  The plot devices are so bloated all the seams in this movie are showing.  This makes it hard to suspend disbelief and fully enjoy the spectacle."
"Apr 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Great scandi style take on the legendary story.
"Apr 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,Boring. Thin storyline. painfully long.
"Apr 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie is overrated by critics and it's not that good. I liked the violent revenge part of this movie too.
"Apr 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"There are some good things and some bad things about The Northman. On the plus side, writer/director Robert Eggers, who started out as a production designer, has devoted great care in recreating a tawdry 10th century Viking world, full of muck and violence, where kings can wind up sheep herders in a very barren-looking Iceland. He shows that Vikings did a large trade in slaves they captured from mostly Slavic areas (from which derives the word ‚Äòslave'), and that their religious rites included using hallucinogens to attain vision experiences. His recreation of the way Viking warriors worked themselves into the ‚Äòberserk' state of a wild beast before battle is a bit less convincing ‚Äì their clumsy movements look too much like the Wild Things' Rumpus Dance. But the bad things are in the plot, loosely drawn from the Scandinavian legend of Prince Amleth who sought revenge for his uncle's murdering his father and marrying his mother ‚Äì the source for Shakespeare's Hamlet. We see everything through Amleth's eyes, first as a young prince who worships his soon-to-be-murdered father, then jumping twenty years later to see him as an apparently invincible Viking warrior who hates his life of raiding and pillaging. When he learns his murderous uncle is now in exile in Iceland, he kicks into revenge mode and disguises himself as a slave to get to him. Amleth is curiously single-minded for a 30-something Viking warrior with a prince's education, who by now would have traveled far and wide pillaging and trading with all sorts of cultures and seen the many shades of gray between good and evil. Would he really be so driven by revenge at this point in his life? Further, for the part of Amleth producer/actor Alexander Skarsg√•rd has gotten himself physically pumped up into a cartoon parody of the actual raw-boned Vikings who didn't have access to good nutrition, workout rooms and personal trainers. Skarsg√•rd is trapped by his two-dimensional character's revenge fixation, which prevents him from doing much real acting. At least there is Anya Taylor-Joy as fellow slave Olga of the Birch Forest, a Slavic witch who is much better connected with the earth's mysteries and far more cunning than Amleth. Early on, Amleth was advised by his father ""Never seek the secrets of women, but heed them always"", and it is his failure to heed women that leads to the film's disappointing ending. After his mother brags to him how she betrayed both his father and him to be murdered by his uncle, Amleth escapes with Olga, who is already carrying his twin children, but then stupidly decides that he must take out his remaining kin to protect his new family. Since there is no real kingdom at stake any more, what exactly is the point? Action film protocol demands a final showdown battle, however, so we get yet another overblown fight scene with lots of testosterone-driven bellowing, and, despite wielding the magical sword Draugr, Amleth of course must die too, like Hamlet."
"Apr 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I'm shocked about the good reviews. Its probably just me then who thought that the acting was horrendous, even from Nicole Kidman and I actually love her. I tried to see the movie as a comedy to survive it ü§£ I would have switched it off after 5 mins but it was a movie night.

PS: I didn't think botox and braces were already a thing back then."
"Mar 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"An artistic combination of history, mythology, religion, and setting to show what viking life may have looked like."
"Mar 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"With all the good things I heard, I thought this was going to be mind-blowing, but it turned out to be movie with some of the most simplistic and base storytelling there is. 

The cast does well, the visuals are great, but the movie just feels boring. There are action scenes to keep you thrilled, but they are few and far between. Does it make it more realistic? Yes, but it's not anything super enthralling."
"Mar 27, 2023",POSITIVE,Entertaining movie. Unusual but interesting flow.
"Mar 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"A great movie, probably not for everyone"
"Mar 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Atmospheric, brutal, cinematic.

Art House Conan üòâ

Wonderful"
"Mar 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Chato, entediante, algumas cenas de a√ß√£o que parece que vai dar vida ao filme mas a√≠ volta a ficar entediante de novo, se tiver problema de ins√¥nia √© s√≥ assistir esse filme todo dia."
"Mar 22, 2023",POSITIVE,People giving this film bad reviews are the reasons why we keep getting these shitty franchise movies that are just there to make money.
"Mar 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not as good as I had hoped for but still overall a good movie. Characters were all cast and done well with the one exception of the main characters mother. Terrible character.
"Mar 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Big fan of all the Viking era shows and this did nothing for me, painful to watch."
"Mar 19, 2023",POSITIVE,"Best movie experience I had in 2022.  Unforgiving and uncompromising in its scope, historical and mythological accuracy, and brutality.  This film longs for the age of historical epic films to return.  It definitely won't be for everyone especially due to it's methodical pacing and morally grey characters but I have no complaints."
"Mar 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,too many spectacles/romanticism about simple revenge and not much content/plot.
"Mar 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved it . I am a huge reader of historical fiction on the Vikings era , and I love Norse Mythology. I thought it was well done, Captured the mysticism, and lots of
Good bloody battles. My wife's name is Olga so that was fulfilling as well!"
"Mar 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Robert Eggers is truly something special! The Northman is simply badass, great redemption story with amazing action and plot. Some of the weird stuff that vikings used to do might be weird to some but the film is still great and has passion to back it up."
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,It just gets better every time you rewatch it. And boy have I rewatched it.
"Mar 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"An epic and mysterious tale with grand scenery and intense atmosphere

This is NOT a dumb, straight-forward action movie. If you are looking for that, this is not for you.

The Northman is a grand tale of revenge in a world of authentic Nordic myth. It is a brutal and dirty world, filled with believable rituals and epic pictures of earth, sky and fire. Its magnificent cinematography elevates it to the next level. It is well crafted on every level, well acted and perfectly executed.

A Shakespearean tale of revenge that shakes off the clean washed Disney look that has dominated the movies in recent years for a more essential movie experience. It is a brutal, Nordic, grown-up, more interesting, less mainstream version of Gladiator. So if you are into movies, really into movies not just the always-same blockbusters, you will enjoy it."
"Mar 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,It was ok - worth a watch but nothing mind blowing... some decent action.
"Mar 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,Painfully slow and stylized.
"Mar 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,I really wanted to like it but I thought it was awful. I love Viking based movies and shows but this was  painful to go through. It has really great actors but even they couldn't save it . I can do artsy movies but this was just bad.
"Mar 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's awful.
Hate the English."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Slow pace tragedy in a sad story about vengeance and destiny. Nice cinematography, good acting. Kidman good as always. Maybe a bit too long or too slow pace in some scenes,"
"Feb 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"How did this rate 90% with critics?! (as of Feb 2023).  The awful accents are still stuck in my head, prolonging the misery resulting from the basic and silly story, weird effects, slow pace, and predictability.  Couldn't wait for it to end, yet held on to hope it might improve.  Nothing satisfying occurred, it just got worse as time went on."
"Feb 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Possibly the best movie I saw in 2022. A massively enjoyable meditation on revenge. Think of it as Hamlet, but with battle axes and disembowelment. Alexander Skarsgard  is his usual beautiful, enigmatic self and Nicole Kidman, despite the uncanny valley effect of all of her cosmetic surgery, gives a performance that should have been more celebrated by the awards folks. Robert Eggers will likely never be given a budget this big again, but he put every penny on the screen. Gorgeous, awe-inspiring, brilliant work."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Oh man, and I was looking forward to this one. üòî
Coming from the director of The Witch, I expected something, different. This felt less historically AUTHENTIC than what I was hoping for. Inspired by legend of Amleth, which in turn inspired Hamlet, this FELT more like (an on-location stage-play of) Hamlet than an actual take on the Norse people. 

Lately, there has been a fascination with Nordic or Spartan mythology. And likewise, the interpretations have been less about authentic reality and more on manly, mythical creative license (emphasis on the toxic masculinity)... Because of this, I tend to roll my eyes at these interpretations. Many times they get passed off AS AUTHENTIC, when if fact most takes are more for style rather than substance. Now I could get into the nitty-gritty (about why I hate these takes on the Norse culture) and I feel I might be a bit TOO harsh but I simply don't have enough time. 

Coming from a director that so expertly blended the, ""authentic,"" with the ""desolate,"" AND even the human condition to mythologize EVERYTHING, this simply didn't sit right with me..."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is my kind of movie. It's a dark revenge adventure story with fantastical elements and I loved it. This is also the first Robert Eggers movie that I have seen and will definitely check out his other ones (The lighthouse/The witch). This movie isn't for everyone, due to the intense gore and already told story, but i'm willing to give this movie a pass because of how old the story is that the movie is based off of. 10/10, wouldn't change a thing about it."
"Feb 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,So awful that I thought it was a joke.
"Feb 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,Expected more from this movie. The casting was great but the story is very boring.
"Feb 19, 2023",POSITIVE,A certeza da vingan√ßa e a reviravolta da verdade mostram com a cren√ßa pode ser misturada com a realidade.
"Feb 16, 2023",POSITIVE,Robert Eggers hits the ball out of the park again with an epic tale of revenge that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish!!!
"Feb 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie, loved the story, the action, and the cast missed the boat on seeing it in theaters but if you have the opportunity to watch I think it is a compelling story with great acting by all!"
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"2 hours and 15 minutes of my life I'll never get back. Great cast, but terrible script, low‚Ä¶and I mean low budget fighting scenes, and just terrible acting. Feels like everyone read the script minutes before shooting. Ah man‚Ä¶this movie sucks!"
"Feb 14, 2023",POSITIVE,"Robert Eggers directs Alexander Skarsg√•rd, Anya Taylor-Joy and many more in his latest feature film. ‚ÄòThe Northman' tells a brutal story of betrayal and revenge, fuelled by graphic imagery and immersive cinematography. Like his previous projects, Eggers doesn't skimp on the gore with ‚ÄòThe Northman', depicting grisly deaths and gruesome mutilations all throughout the 140-minute runtime. Eggers reunites with many of his past associates for the film, including editor Louise Ford, production designer Craig Lathrop and costume designer Linda Muir to name a few.

Alexander Skarsg√•rd stars as Amleth, a prince on the cusp of becoming a man who, after a brutal ambush, witnesses his father's (Ethan Hawke) death at the hands of his uncle (Claes Bang). Two decades later, and now a Viking on a mission to avenge his father, Amleth meets Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), a headstrong woman who aides Amleth in the completion of his quest. As the opportunity for revenge grows closer, will Amleth succeed in his bloody crusade? Or will he fall before his uncle's blade?

Eggers reunites with ‚ÄòThe Lighthouse' and ‚ÄòThe Witch' cinematographer Jarin Blaschke to create ‚ÄòThe Northman's bewitching cinematography, littering the film with smooth, lengthy takes, and making effective use of the natural light available to them. Blaschke's visuals serve as the perfect way to show off the film's intricate production design, courtesy of Craig Lathrop, who's recent projects include Antonio Campos' ‚ÄòThe Devil All the Time' and Egger's previous film ‚ÄòThe Lighthouse' - Lathrop's work is just one of the many ways the film immerses you into 10th century Iceland. Much like Eggers' previous work, ‚ÄòThe Northman' is not only an entertaining film, but is a feast for the eyes, with intricate details seen all over the screen.

Headlined by a marvellous turn from Alexander Skarsg√•rd, ‚ÄòThe Northman' features strong performances from its entire star-studded cast. Nicole Kidman, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Claes Bang each given thrilling performances, with the criminally underused Willem Dafoe and Ethan Hawke also each giving remarkable turns. Though Kidman's best moment comes when she delivers a twisted, venom-laced monologue to her son (Skarsg√•rd) that turns his world upside down. ‚ÄòThe Northman' once again shows that Robert Eggers doesn't skimp on heavy gore or nudity in his films and isn't afraid to let his films be ugly and gruesome. Louise Ford's editing makes sure to show off the film's intense violence and deaths, including an unbroken scene where a character has his nose completely sliced off, nude fights and reanimated corpses. ‚ÄòThe Northman' is a film that does a remarkable job of keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout the entirety of the film, effectively walking the line between nail biting action and intense drama, encircled in a gritty tale of revenge.

Not only does Robert Eggers deliver yet another technical masterclass, but the revered director also delivers a film with a vicious, meaty story that you can easily sink your teeth into, brilliantly drawn together with an unexpected ending. Perhaps one of the most artistic revenge thrillers to come in recent years, ‚ÄòThe Northman' is an epic-sized, bloody affair, driven by its powerful performances and impressive technical aspects. The film leaves you anticipating Robert Eggers next outing in the director's chair, which, based on recent interviews, may involve Eggers bringing a story set in the Elizabethan era to the big screen."
"Feb 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,Alot of pointless trying to be artsy stuff thrown in that literally took the story away and made it boring.
"Feb 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just don't watch it and save 2 hours of your life
"Feb 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,Quite possibly the worst acting I have ever seen in a movie.
"Feb 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"As ""The Northman"" (2022 release; 137 min) opens, we are in ""The North Atlantic, AD 895"" when an expedition led by the King comes home, to the delight of the Queen and the young Prince. The King leads the Prince into a ritual to become a ""man"". Then one day, the King and the Prince are ambushed and the King is killed by his jealous brother... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.

Couple of comments: this is the latest from writer-producer-director Robert Eggers (""The Witch"", ""The Lighthouse""). Here he brings the tale of a Viking whose father, the King, is killed and the Viking is bent on revenge, no matter what to cost or how long it takes. Let's state the obvious: the movie's storyline, and everything else, is about as subtle as a bull in a china shop. There isn't a single moment in the film that I thought: ""Oh wow, this is unexpected"". That aside, the production (with Ireland standing in for ""Viking land"") is top notch, as are the lead performances, none more so than Alexander Skarsgard as the revenge-seeking Viking. This is by no means a ""bad"" movie, but neither is it an outstanding movie. For that it is way too predictable and straight-forward.

""The Northman"" was released in US theaters this past Spring, to very disappointing box office numbers. It then went to VOD, and now is streaming on Amazon Prime, where I caught it. This might be the type of movie that benefits from being seen on a large screen rather than at home. If you are in the mood for a brutal Viking revenge drama that is about as subtle as a bull in a china shop, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion."
"Feb 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,I wish we focused less on the abs of the main actor and made more meaningful stories.
"Feb 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"An actual good movie. The plot is tried and you've seen it before, but the same can be said of any movie; all stories have been told before, so what matters is execution. 

It's a beautiful looking movie that's well acted, well written, and well directed. If violent movies don't appeal to you, then this is probably not going to be your thing anymore than musicals are to me (so I don't watch and rate them)."
"Feb 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's a lot of nonsense, but fun to watch.  Moody, ethereal, striking scenery and technically flawless in terms of cinematography and special effects.  Story is goofy mythology, supernatural events mixed with blood soaked fighting and battles, swords everywhere chopping off heads and emptying guts, etc.  Not as heavy and intellectually meaningful as perhaps Eggers and co-writer Sjon intend.  It only succeeds in evincing human rage and revenge and leans very heavily on mystical Nordic/Viking religiosity which is not that meaningful to a modern audience.  Even with all that, it is very visually well made film with great performances, and quite entertaining.  It is obscure and hard to follow the dialogue and plot at times, but I felt like it had something to offer I might have missed, so I watched it twice and liked it a lot better the second time."
"Feb 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,Entertaining but not great
"Jan 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,Was hoping for more from this movie.
"Jan 25, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is a historical drama masterpiece.

Finally a director who cares about authentic portrayal of the period. The story was simple, yet brilliant and reminded me of Icelandic sagas. The third act was a little bit drawn out and could have been shorter, but all in all, it was perfect."
"Jan 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The quality of this movie is a straight up affront to the 137-minutes of my life that I spent watching it.

It's cliched, forced, and lacks a noteworthy character or storyline that's worth the while. An annoying pile of mess, no less.

Unbelievable!"
"Jan 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Like a good Viking flick? Pass on this movie, it's not that. Beautifully shot, with some good performances from the leads, but suffers from a terminally pointless plot, and just overloaded with weird, supernatural nonsense. Pretty much a waste of some incredibly charismatic actors. Some good moments, but an amazing opportunity wasted."
"Jan 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Generally disappointed.  Expected an epic saga, but it was a long, relentlessly hideous and bloody bummer of a film."
"Jan 23, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Awful! Terrible, stiff dialogue, terrible direction. Great art direction and great costumes, though. A ripoff from hamlet, the director couldn't decide whether he wanted to keep it realistic or make it sounds ""Shakespearean."" Pure glorification of violence and macho culture. The whole movie is an excuse to show two hot guys fighting naked in a volcano. I wasted two hours of my life."
"Jan 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A very interesting take on hamlet. I throughly enjoyed the sets and costumes, and the extremely accurate depiction of the Viking world."
"Jan 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,This was one of the worst films I have ever tried to watch.  Do yourself a favor and pass on it.
"Jan 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It just didn't do it for me, I found the plot too simple in its core but full of meaningless and disjointed. And the acting (an impressive cast!) a little bit over the fence, like they were trying too hard to sell it."
"Jan 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Everything in the trailer made me want to watch this. It's a long winded film with not a lot happening. I don't blame the actors but it's tragically dull. It's not suspenseful or clever. I've seen worse but‚Ä¶
"Jan 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Frankly boring & irritatingly bad despite all the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" metal Viking extreme hype & star power  - there were walk outs from the big screen at our viewing - I joined them - it's really that bad."
"Jan 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"it... was sorta ok... but nothing spectacular.
if you have nothing else to watch its worth a watch as one of the last things to watch on your list."
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"""It sucked. Where's Thor?"" 
This film is what films used to be. An actual movie. A very familiar story. Outstanding look for a modern release. It has tone.. It has tone...."
"Jan 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,I expected so much more from this movie. A star studded cast couldn't save this script.
"Jan 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Beautifully executed film. The score was perfect, the casting spectacular. Perfect."
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a masterful and original presentation of Shakespeare's Hamlet. I watched it twice and the second time it came to me that this was Viking Hamlet. Fantastic. So wonderful to see this done with complete respect and the power of Viking culture meshed with Elizabethan era Elsinore. Plus Alexander Skarsgard's acting (not to mention his magnificent body, ahem) is really awe inspiring. Mr. Skarsgard, you are better than Olivier. The best Hamlet I ever saw. So there."
"Jan 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A brutally bleak period drama based on revenge. Most of the movie took place in one area which wadnt what I was expecting, some good moments, some cliches I didnt like such as why doesnt the bad guy just kill him at the end when he has the chance, he was basically asking for to be killed. Very bleak ending, everyone dies, so dark... I felt like crap after watching that ngl, dont like movies that bleak generally. My rating could move up with time, Queen's Gambit still my favorite Eggers work so far."
"Jan 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This felt like they gave a movie budget and amazing actors to a director making a college art video. The movie is has long winded scenes, one dimensional characters, and a shallow plot. Want a movie about vikings look elsewhere"
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,The best viking movie I have ever seen!
"Jan 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Meh. It passed the time.
"Jan 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Boring, story sounded promising but it didn't deliver. Some films are good enough to watch again, this one is barely worth watching the first time round."
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,Best Viking movie made in the longest time 
"Jan 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,Bad storyline. Bad dialogue. Unnecessary scene. Oh what a bad movie.
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love it! 

One of the best films in a long time, it takes you back in time."
"Jan 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"How? Why? This was a poor movie all around and I love odd plots and storyline twists. I'm also a fan of gore and blood. The casting was unbelievable, except for Bjork. The only thing that kept me watching was what the lighting was doing on Kidman's face."
"Jan 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,What a disappointing movie!  Once again a production company releases trailers that don't depict at all what the movie is going to be like.  This thing zapped the interest out of me with it's long winded scenes.  Could have been one of the best pictures of the year.  Some questionable casting as well.
"Jan 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,This movie has some really good cinematography. The movie's plot was definitely not what I thought it would be-not necessarily a good way or bad. 7/10
"Jan 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely awful.  Like, bad bad"
"Jan 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,Weak plot. Awful character development corny special effects. Gratuitous barking and groaning. Make it stop.
"Jan 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A little too much, actually. But wonderful atmosphere and visuals."
"Jan 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible movie! What nonsense!
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,Rating: 9/10. 90/100
"Jan 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,I was hoping for another awesome viking series. Could not stand the style nor the music this director uses. I could not even sit through half an hour of it. Messed up ritual with father and son. Count me out. Just weird.
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,It's an awesome movie. Really god action and camera
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Very solid movie. Nothing unique or special, yet all aspects the movie attempted are well done. Contrast and symbolization are well done. Violent but charming and beatiful."
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Absolutely mind blowing historically accurate no half measures badass film, everybody played authentic, chilling atmosphere and music, great shots and simple yet already perfect dialogs and plot, we need to give more money to director, brilliant man."
"Jan 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This one is worthy of the title ""epos"". The landscapes in which the story unfolds, are cold, inhospitable and barren, like the characters that cling to animalism and war-god beliefs. I would classify the feel somewhere inbetween Gladiator, The 13th Warrior and The Fellowship of the Ring. And despite it feeling somehow modern and a little bit too stylish, I am convinced that the producers tried to put emphasis on historical aspects and daily life routines."
"Jan 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"De esas pel√≠culas que a la gente le da pena decir que son malas porque son muy art√≠sticas y tienen lenguaje ingl√©s antiguo. Lenta, obscura, sin un mensaje trascendente, bonita direcci√≥n esc√©nica."
"Jan 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"My favorite movie of 2022. Phenomenal adaption of the tale that inspired William Shakespear's ""Hamlet""."
"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,interesting and fast moving.  weaves the mythical aspects in a way that isnt heavy handed and 'comic booky' way.  even the excessive violence feels appropriate in a way that might seem exploitive in other films. i dont normally like this type of movie but this film captured me the whole way.
"Jan 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed it. I consider this to be better than ""The Witch"" and much better than ""The Lighthouse"". I don't have any specific complaints. I was kinda expecting it to be another ""Gladiator"", so I am a bit lukewarm after having seen it."
"Jan 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Authentic, cerebral but slow and boring at times."
"Jan 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,I watched it for about 10 minutes. Enough! Were all the movie critics on LSD when they made their reviews? How low can you go?
"Jan 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,Can be slow in parts but great watch
"Jan 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It was like a Teenager was given a big budget to make a Viking movie.
Take some beautiful scenery, a few well-known actors and half decent story and you've got the makings of a pretty good movie. Unfortunately, the execution fell flat. Lots of random, drawn-out scenes which seemed to make no sense at all. I made it all the way to the end hoping it would get better but I was horribly disappointed."
"Jan 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Really wanted to love it. Love the actors in it, love the Viking concept. It just wasn't a very good story, the writing just wasn't there. With the actors they had this movie could have been epic.. smh"
"Jan 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,Terrible! Worst movie I‚Äôve seen in years. The dialogue would have been funny if this was a spoof of Viking movies. Strong cast with very bad script.
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I'm descended from vikings (Rollo to be exact). Went into this movie with no expectations, but then came out really enjoying it. Gave me a lot to think about. Thought Alexander Skarsgard was great as ""the Northman."" Gave at times a subtle to an in-your-face performance. Filmed in Northern Ireland, Ireland and Iceland--the scenery is stunning. All of the performances were excellent."
"Jan 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I can't believe I've just watched what people here have already reviewed.  The fight scenes are really bad, the acting is average and the only plot twist is banal.  So many holes I'm not sure where I'd start.  It feels like a really bad Viking copy of Gladiator."

"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just cycled 44 kilometers to see this movie and it was every kilometer worth it. The cinematography is after the Batman, the best of the year so far, it's gorgeous. The acting is magnificent from everyone. The directing by Robert Eggers is so good and the sound design and editing is insane. The only thing is, that I didn't always knew, was what the rituals meant, so it was kinda weird then. The violence in this movie man, some people in my theatre were definitely not prepared for it and there were only 8 people including me. This movie was an awesome artistic movie + there are quite some Shakespeare references I think in this movie, for example the iconic sword death in Macbeth, when the king is sleeping and Macbeth kills him, kinda cool to see."
"Jan 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Eggers has the beginnings of a reputation for authentic period dialogue. This one doesn't land for me, though. It ain't Hamlet. Especially the opening scenes struck me as hokey. But a good cast saves it from being completely laughable.

I don't know the legend being depicted, so I can't speak to its quality as a treatment of that. A bit on the gratuitous side.

Eggers (primarily a production designer) creates strong visuals with only a few moments of weak CG detracting."
"Jan 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,Visually great. Story is fine. Conclusion is meh.
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pretty good. Original in its own ways but basically Hamlet and the Lion King story line. Acting is good and the cinematography is outstanding and its pretty entertaining, only thing that I could think of that could be a problem was the pacing and maybe the music."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"beautifully shot, acted and written. I loved every minute of this. The action scenes were spectacular."
"Jan 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,This movie was trying way too hard. The accents were ridiculous‚Ä¶ stop rolling your Rs so hard Queens Gambit. The main character was underwhelming though it was no fault of the actor. Cinematography was excellent. Story was drawn out and unimaginative. Would not recommend. 
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,If you liked Conan the barbarian movies then this is for you.
"Jan 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,Booooring. One character reminded me of Lord Farquaad from Shrek. Go watch that instead.
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,I generally hate movies from this director so I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. I also think it's kinda underrated lowkey
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Eggers! You did it, this movie is amazing! Dare I say, better than The Lighthouse? If R-Patts had a starring role as well, this would be my number one movie of 2022 so far. The visuals are stunning; the landscapes, breathtaking. It made me want to rewatch Lamb! The cast was wonderful as well. My only wish is for a touch more chemistry between Scarsg√§rd and Taylor Joy. But we can't have it all! Keep up the good work Eggers."
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Objectively, this movie had some flaws and parts of it seemed either rushed or cut, but nothing that took me out of it in the moment. I am rating on how much I enjoyed this movie! It is super unfortunate that it didn't do well in theatres. Robert Eggers is brimming with talent and I would love to see him succeed continuously! His attention to detail really shines in this film and the acting is top notch.  Definitely, the best Viking movie that has ever been made."
"Jan 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,It wasn't what I expected I thought it was slow and a bit trippy at times!
"Jan 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Another great movie by Eggers. Suitable for many audiences, more so than his previous films. Captivating cinematography, score, and plot. It feels authentic to the time period and has you on the edge of your seat. 9/10."
"Jan 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Overall very good, but I thought the ending sucked."
"Jan 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,Not bad just not what I was expecting. A slow burner with some action.
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just watched it and I'd give it an 8/10. Eggers is one of the most talented directors of the young generation. The acting is at a very high level, the set design, the costumes are perfect, the film keeps you in suspense until the last minute. However, the level of brutality in the first 40 minutes will not appeal to everyone. This is not a subtle film, we are dealing with the uncompromising nature of the main character whose driving force is obsessive revenge and animal fury. Many references in the main character's visions to Norse mythology such as Valhalla, Valkyrie, yggdrassil tree"
"Jan 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Overall, Robert Eggers has delivered another stunning film. ¬†This film is loaded with beautiful visuals, including dream sequences and beautiful landscapes. ¬†The film itself is dark, violent, gritty and brutal, and I was highly entertained for the entire duration, even if some moments flew over my mind at first. ¬†Aspects relating to the plot are a little predictable, but I still smiled watching everything unfold from start to finish. ¬†Performances are tremendous and can't be faulted. ¬†This feature won't be for everyone, especially given the many disturbing unsettling moments.¬† Those familiar with the director's craft and skill will know what to expect, and here the director is playing with a bigger budget than fans have experienced previously. ¬†I found myself admiring this film visually, and its story had me by the veins; it's a wonderful and memorable achievement for cinema."
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,An artistic take on a bare bones classic revenge story. An incredibly well researched love letter to Scandinavian mythology. A violent journey into a brutal world. A triumph.
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,Saw this at the theatre and really enjoyed it. Nothing better than a good revenge story. Worth seeing.
"Dec 31, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Hamlet meets Conan in a time of Norse barbarism. Good acting, great action but somehow it doesn't click. Some plot devices felt disjointed and the end was a bit meh. Didn't feel invested in any of the characters particularly"
"Dec 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"A movie that respects its concept, it has the magic that the old movies had. If some people say ""it's nothing new"" and ""we have seen this many times before"" don't listen to them, after all a team that wins doesn't need change. Anyway for me it's 10/10"
"Dec 31, 2022",NEGATIVE,"An idiot with idiotic life goals does idiotic things. The movie looks great. Why is everyone rolling their Rs so much? Sounds like a bunch of people imitating cats r something. Effects were a bit off, especially nicole kidman's face."
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,Cannot understand how people hate on this movie. It's a movie taking me back to the glory days of film. By a million miles better than any other story today. I take it that the people hating on the movie is the same people loving rings of power.
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,Captivating with stunning cinematography. Highly recommend. A few abstract scenes but found them interesting. My 13 yr old son watched the entire movie which is saying something.
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"By far the BEST film of 2022. The low ranking here makes no sense. From the incredible performances from the entire cast - (especially Alexander Skarsg√•rd & Anya Taylor-Joy & Ethan Hawke), to the glorious cinematography by Jarin Blaschke. Eggers and his whole team have created something that transcends and enthralls. Bravo. A+"
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,An elevated-feeling Viking historical drama with action.
"Dec 29, 2022",NEGATIVE,Absaloute shite. Avoid.
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"The Northman is one of Robert Eggers' critically acclaimed films, it is the most brutal yet harrowing movie i've ever seen with stunning visuals, cinematography, action sequences, and the performances of Alexander Skarsgard playing the vengeful Viking warrior."
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,I was pleasantly surprised by the beauty and the magic of this film. So refreshingly different from all the current Viking Fever Fare.
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"While I definitely prefer his previous films, this is definitely Eggars most cinematic and crowd-pleasing film to date without compromising his attention to detail or unique vision. It's visually stunning and incredibly exciting. A fantastic cast and a fantastic film."
"Dec 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"A refreshing film in an era of reboots, remakes and attempts at cinematic universes. Great pacing, the story is engaging, the cinematography and direction by Robert Egger is fantastic and intriguing as always. I really enjoyed it, the acting was glorious. Skarsgard outdid himself in his role in this Viking take on Hamlet."
"Dec 27, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Grimey, sweaty pretention at its absolute worst."
"Dec 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,"A vengeance fueled Norse tale is a very good tale with slow points. Robert Eggers returns with another wild, twisted tale yet the ending isn't as satisfying as we would have hoped it to be. Sequel possibly? Probably not, but it doesn't hurt to dream."
"Dec 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Fantastic Viking folklore. Brutal, gritty, with superior directing. At first glance, it seems like your typical revenge story. However, the narrative takes some unexpected turns."
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Simply put - they should make more movies like this.
This biggest fault about this movie was the advertising. They advertised it as sort of a noir viking action, when in fact it was a historical drama with some (although great) action. 
The acting was amazing. Skarsgaard was unrecognisable in some scenes. The scenery was awesome. 
You could say that the whole story was something already seen. It's a good ol' vengeance story, however with a bit slower pace, but better story."
"Dec 26, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Watched because we heard JRE raving about this movie. We did watch the entire movie, but couldn't wait for it to end."
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"Captivating from start to finish. Pacing, character depiction and story arc, acting, cinematography, directing are all great and costume design is Excellent. Some minor small issues stops it from getting a 5/5 rating. Hollywood needs more of these types of movies. After all, film making IS an artform, not just a cash cow. Also - Fun to learn this as well as Hamlet (and in turn The Lion King) was based on the same story."
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"Don't watch The Northman expecting something like the 'The Vikings' TV series. This isn't about raiding but a movie interpretation of a saga and anyone who's a fan of reading the sagas will appreciate this. A very personal story mixed in with Old Norse supernatural like many of the good sagas are. Beautifully shot and a satisfying end. 

Those saying the story is clich√© are familiar with Hamlet and watched the Lion King, but are obviously ignorant to the fact Lion King copied Hamlet, which was inspired by the legend of Amleth. This film isn't the clich√©, it's based on the original legend"
"Dec 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"It just goes to show, you can write a pretty damn awesome revenge story inspired by a REAL viking revenge myth, that inspired Shakespeare's Hamlet and you can't make everyone happy. Most likely Oliver Stone got his idea from this for Conan The Barbarian, not the other way round. People looking for the typical viking tv show, might be dissapointed. Its brutal and it shows a delusional kid that loved his father and believes his father to be a good natured super hero. Finds out hes an immoral man and his mother is a manipulator and its possible the guy he was after all along might be the good guy in the story lol. Its a story that assumption can get you into a lot of trouble in life. Theres no winners here."
"Dec 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,If you like fantasy you might like it. If you're looking for an action movie about the vikings you'll be bored and frustrated.
"Dec 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great cast, great action and nobody force feeding you their personal ""messages"".  It's drew a bit heavy on the mystical stuff and think it could've been pulled off slightly better if left more ""real"", but a good flick nonetheless."
"Dec 20, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Eggers continua a creare prodotti pi√π adatti ad un pubblico con alta conoscenza del cinema e che riesca ad apprezzare ogni dettaglio stilistico delle opere.
""The northman"" unisce abilmente la brutalit√† e crudezza di un film di guerra, con un'accentuata nota spirituale e visionaria riuscendo a rendere meno invadente la sensazione di conoscere gi√† il finale dell'ennesimo revenge movie.
Spettacolare √® la fotografia che con l'aiuto delle incredibili location senza dubbio risulta essere la parte migliore in assoluto del film.
Un po' troppo prevedibile la sceneggiatura, con l'unico grande colpo di scena offerto dal personaggio di Nicole Kidman.
Il tocco del regista si vede ed offre un buon film, in un genere che per√≤ ormai √® da evitare come la peste."
"Dec 20, 2022",NEGATIVE,Not very engaging. Intense but not compelling
"Dec 19, 2022",POSITIVE,Best depiction of one part of viking culture I have seen this far.
"Dec 17, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Scandinavian Hamlet extravaganza, or what Shakespeare's Hamlet wished he could be. Instead of skulking empty castles halls, raiding Rus villages. Robert Eggers claims this is one of the most authentic and accurate Viking movies ever made. As you watch, you will definitely start to believe it. Dimly lit dugouts as houses, grand halls of kings with no windows. Mud and anguish. Swords are considered a luxury, and the only way to get anything but an axe is to be rich or rob a draugr. Fortunately, the narrative doesn't skip out on the spiritual aspect of seafaring raiders. As the film is filled with dreams, gods, and premonitions, Alexander Skarsg√•rd is assured that his fate is sealed and that he has nothing but vengeance in his life. Regretfully, Northman doesn't really end up being better than Lighthouse despite the 100 million-dollar difference. Not because the actors or the story are bad, but because Lighthouse gradually immerses you in its power dynamics and allegory, whether Northman has a rushed beginning and really meanders in the middle, despite having a magnificent third act. What also brings it down are the visual aspects. Due to being hellbent on realism, the fire scenes are lit by fire and nothing else. However, when there is no source of light, the movie uses a very pronounced filter that really betrays the atmosphere. I am not saying you shouldn't be able to see anything, but there are certainly ways around it. The other thing is fight choreography. By God, it looks staged. Almost every single hit just looks sluggish and avoidable."
"Dec 17, 2022",POSITIVE,"The Northman is a big departure from Eggers' usual work, but not an unwelcome one. The film benefits from his eye for detail and authenticity, as well as his impeccable sense of pacing. All this, aided by great cinematography, beautiful sets, and sparse use of CGI help make this movie a very gracious take on what is in essence just a generic revenge story."
"Dec 16, 2022",NEGATIVE,Amazing cinematography and director shot them well however the story just dragged.  The main character is not much of a main character actor in my opinion and just was kind dull.
"Dec 16, 2022",POSITIVE,"THE MOVIE! I'm really in shock with the beauty and savagery in this one. And I love Alexander so much and here, omg, this man is a monument, a fortress, a wall. I cant breathe. AMAZING!"
"Dec 16, 2022",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie, especially if you realize what the director is trying to achieve."
"Dec 15, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Grotesque and shocking visually, this movie puts a lot of effort into putting the viewer into the mind of a primitive and savage Viking berzerker. Briefly, this movie had a lot of scenes that were shockingly violent, offputting, or just inexplicably strange... but entertaining! The soundtrack was perfect and fitting to the mood and the acting overall was decent with notable standouts being from Skarsgard who was all around amazing, Willem Dafoe as a creepy soothsayer or 'he-witch' was a treat, Ann Taylor Joy was convincing in her role, and Claes Bang as the villain was pretty decent.

From what I've read, the berzerkers were no strangers to hallucinogenics ‚Äì and the main character exhibits what I perceived to be hallucinations which accompany what is briefly shown as an extremely violent and hard life. There's the soothsaying element that twists these visions he has into a just barely coherent (intentionally... maybe?) prophecy and intersperses some magic/fantasy element that isn't confirmed to be 'real' or 'imagined.' 

The biggest con of this movie was it almost felt too committed to primitive savagery in a way that it couldn't deliver on the immersion enough for me to discount certain actions from the characters. Certain characters, mainly Skarsgard's, seemed to struggle with his heuristic adventure in some ways which were deranged, and others which were totally understandable. Other character's reactions to his deeds were also confusing and hard to understand including the decision of the 'villain' to, upon witnessing Skarsgard soaked in blood over his executed wife and son simply walk away and tell him to meet him at the Gates of Hel... which was apparently a known location as Skarsgard did just that later that day."
"Dec 14, 2022",POSITIVE,"A good movie to watch before your next football game, wrestling match, big fight, or whatever sporting event where getting ""hyped up"" is crucial. Reading all the seething 1-star reviews from the wokies after watching this 300-esque gripping piece of cinema was the icing on the cake. Robert Eggers minimalistic realism-styled approach to cinematography is well suited for this hostile time period to be alive in Europe. You'll feel the cold of the wind and the grit of the mud while watching. You'll lose yourself in the stark dichotomy of the brutal existence that was the ancient world and the overwhelmingly lavish life we live today. You'll be hard-pressed not to feel some stoking of your inner primordial being that yearns for a time when life was a gift and every moment you had was lived to the fullest, not wasted in a phone or office building."
"Dec 14, 2022",NEGATIVE,It was too slow for me. Nicole Kidman's talent and beauty were not in full display. I could not in good conscious recommend The Northman.
"Dec 12, 2022",NEUTRAL,Could be better and less time consuming.
"Dec 12, 2022",POSITIVE,the best movie of the year by far
"Dec 12, 2022",NEGATIVE,This was one of the most hilariously horrible movies I've ever seen. The love child of Rod Stewart and Madonna.
"Dec 11, 2022",NEGATIVE,Absolutely awful. Go watch Vikings instead.
"Dec 10, 2022",POSITIVE,"Epic in every way. If you are prepared to immerse yourself, this film will pay back in spades. The performances are transformative and it's a really interesting take on the Viking genre."
"Dec 10, 2022",POSITIVE,Great movie with plenty of layers. Definitely not for kids. Some younger adults may not appreciate the film as much as Gen X (and older Millennials).
"Dec 10, 2022",POSITIVE,"I greatly enjoyed this movie, from the acting to the score, to the plot. Definitely a must see."
"Dec 10, 2022",POSITIVE,I have Scandinavian roots and everything I've studied about Viking culture was so well depicted in this movie. It had a great plot and mainly Scandinavian cast which was a great choice to make this movie feel exciting and meaningful
"Dec 7, 2022",NEGATIVE,"So it happened. I finally found a movie SO bad yet SO overrated, I felt the need to create an RT account to try and tell the world how awful it is.
What in Odin's beard is the point of this horrible film? I mean granted it does have some action scenes and a not too bad scenery from time to time... But the rest? Why does one have to waste the potential of so many high-profile actors?
The characters are as deep as a puddle with no development whatsoever and the plot is what I would expect to be the result of ""Alexa, write me a viking movie."" This movie is so predictable I had lunch receipts with more surprising outcome.
I have not seen anything so packed with painfully dumb stereotypes, shallow dialogues and ridiculous plot twists in a long time.... And I have suffered through several Peppa Pig episodes and Barbie movies in recent years.
Don't waste your time on this movie. Watch the trailer and dream up a viking revenge plot with the least possible effort. I guarantee you it will be more entertaining than this."
"Dec 6, 2022",POSITIVE,"It's hard for me to critique or give details about why I love this movie, especially since I really don't watch many movies like this, but I'll try. The performances are amazing, the set design is wonderful, the writing is beautifully done, and the story brings emotion and tension, even when sometimes I was confused about what was going on, and that was my fault not the movie's. 

Robert Eggers should be on everyone's radars now. Between this and The Lighthouse, he's cemented himself as not only an amazing director, but an incredible writer. Gonna watch The VVItch soon, highly suggest this and The Lighthouse."
"Dec 5, 2022",POSITIVE,Amazing movie and the ending had me thinking of this movie for quite awhile.  Can't wait to watch it again knowing what I know.
"Dec 5, 2022",NEGATIVE,only 1 action raid scene. after that it's some secret plot bs. silly af. went from hard to soft and stupid.
"Dec 5, 2022",NEGATIVE,A little to Shakespearen for my taste
"Dec 5, 2022",POSITIVE,The Northman is an epic yet meditative revenge tale that cuts more than bone deep with its complex themes and moral ambiguity.
"Dec 3, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Not worth watching, basic storyline ruined by very poor production, and the ridiculous abrupt ending, expecting much better with the big name actors."
"Dec 3, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Dreadful, dreary, self indulgent, full of cliches and so much copied from Conan the Barbarian. 132 minutes of my life wasted"
"Dec 3, 2022",NEGATIVE,theres some sick af scenes but its mid movie so rip - Light 5/10
"Dec 2, 2022",POSITIVE,"A true masterpiece, it excels in every aspect of cinematography. A carefully written script directed along with beautiful photography and a deep, visceral trip into nordic culture."
"Dec 2, 2022",POSITIVE,Really good. Excellent fight scenes. Great photography. Good to see a historical film that at least tries to be accurate. Well worth the effort.
"Dec 2, 2022",POSITIVE,"This is definitely not for everyone but if you want a brutally honest look at an ancient pagan culture, this is the movie for you."
"Dec 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,"'The Northman' is the best movie of the worst movie year. It's a horrific and boringly long, predictable yawn of debauchery, slavery, filth, and revenge that should be seen by no one and will not be missed or remembered."
"Dec 1, 2022",POSITIVE,"Robert Eggers persists on realism. When telling tails as wild, fathoming depths as bravely, there's few directors that bring the surreal to life in the same way. If films are perfect, some can be almost such. Northman is a robust sensation, taking all senses to appreciate it's value. (I watched in theaters and it impressed me)
Even in the dim light and sound at one's home, you're as easily swept away to a place you can never leave. Meant to see things you could never see, unless this film existed. Performances here are convincing enough, I never thought twice. Especially with how simply they're written to play about a world completely alien, alive, and available. The film provides color, movement, meaning, and mystery all by its display on a screen. There's moments in this film that transport you to places one simply shouldn't, couldn't possibly perceive. As if the film were created in a vacuum, it's untouched by time. I'll watch it again when I'm ready. That's how special it is; I don't wanna waste it."
"Nov 30, 2022",POSITIVE,Great film. Loads of blood and gore. If you liked the Vikings and Last Kingdom series then this film is for you.
"Nov 30, 2022",NEGATIVE,Hard to tell what's going on. Mediocre fights and a mid storyline. Not worth the hype at all. Mid ending
"Nov 29, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I don't understand how anyone could possibly like this movie.  It felt like a bunch of short films smashed together while doing acid.

No plot, jumpy storyline, and nonsensical characters.

Just flat out awful!"
"Nov 28, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Cheesey and cringey, nothing compared to Vikings and Last Kingdom."
"Nov 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Good film. Thought I'd give it a go. Think its the first full film ive watched and enjoye. Was a wonderful mix of vikings, beliefs an customs. But the ending? Noooo."
"Nov 27, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Stunning scenery but revenge certainly took a long time coming in this barely human, brutal, roaring, grunting animalistic blood bath lacking in any character redeeming features."
"Nov 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,Not what I was expecting. Tries to paint a more realistic picture of life for Vikings. The revenge part is fine but intertwined with supernatural stuff which wasn't for me.  Not an enjoyable film but does hold your interest.
"Nov 27, 2022",NEGATIVE,Horrible. Especially if you compare this to the history channels viking show. Boring boring boring
"Nov 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,Was a great Saturday night watch
"Nov 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Eggers' films probably aren't for everyone so I get the slightly mixed audience reviews, however they are for me. A beautifully shot nordic revenge story. Like the Witch feels like it's set in it's period and not pandering to 21st century sensibilities."
"Nov 26, 2022",NEGATIVE,Worst Viking movie ever. Pointless plot.
"Nov 26, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Misoginistic, unoriginal and boring."
"Nov 26, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I heard so much praise for this film, but after watching it, I felt cheated out of a pleasant cinematic experience. With such a fantastic cast, I expected much more. Unfortunately, the brutal violence is not enough to keep an audience intrigued with a story that zig zags too much."
"Nov 24, 2022",NEUTRAL,Robert Eggers has obviously read the same books I have regarding medieval Scandinavian culture including Ahmad ibn Fadlan's 10th Century travelogue and scholarly books like the Viking Way by Neal Price. Many scenes seem to have been constructed with those books in mind.  I love Egger's obsession with getting the historicity perfect.  The story itself was compelling and the acting good. The mixing of the natural and supernatural is enchanting.  The only criticism was the end was over the top.
"Nov 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"Insane visuals, a great watch if you're into a bit of a less mainstream format and movies with historic/Shakespearean style storytelling. Also great performance from Alexander Skarsgard as Amleth."
"Nov 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"If you are a fan from action or superheroes movies this movie is not for you, because is not an action and full of battles movie. If you are a fan from Scandinavian mythology, symbolic art, occult and magic ...or simply of good made cinema as Robert Eggers made on his two previous movies, you will love this movie!"
"Nov 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning, perfectly researched, immaculately acted and driven with passion, intensity and true Viking valor, this is easily a next step for director Robert Egger's already excellent career."
"Nov 21, 2022",NEUTRAL,Accomplished what it should.
"Nov 20, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Considering the big names attached to this I expected more. Nothing stands out as exceptional and there were plenty of failures. It's fine if you don't think too much into it and you want a basic easily digestible plot. Special mentions: SPOILERS

 The whole ""side quest"" scene where the protagonist must find his magical weapon seems to be the only reason DeFoe is in the movie and he's not even in the scene.

Twisting the story of Odin's quest for knowledge to incorporate modern woke idealism is laughable."
"Nov 19, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Terrible acting, and just bizarre story and cgi. The only reason I lasted the film was I was intrigued if the film would get better. I'm gutted I wasted 2hrs on a sat night, and gutted because this should of been right up my tree. Great cast but poor overall production"
"Nov 18, 2022",POSITIVE,Visually arresting. Robert Eggers' commitment to folklore and historical accuracy immerses us in the world.
"Nov 16, 2022",POSITIVE,"A brutal and uncompromising revenge tale despite a conflict of themes, The Northman is a visual marvel that sees Robert Eggers further expanding his talents with a rock-solid ensemble to booth."
"Nov 16, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Boring and weird. Half way though, I thought to myself, ""this would have made a better play than a movie."" It seems to reflect a theatrical performance instead of a movie."
"Nov 16, 2022",POSITIVE,"cool movie, not as good as the lighthouse but y'know."
"Nov 15, 2022",NEGATIVE,This is honestly the worst movie I have ever seen. It is ridiculous on so many levels. There are some big names in it that I can't believe they looked at the script and signed on to act in this debacle. I don't walk away from many movies I start - this is one of the few I could not finish.
"Nov 15, 2022",POSITIVE,"If you have ever heard of Hamlet, you'll immediately get the story. The Saga of Amleth, and his revenge against his  murderous uncle in a very authentic viking imagery. This is no superhero movie, it is a bloody saga where the hero gets his rightful ticket to Valhall√§. Small!"
"Nov 13, 2022",POSITIVE,"Ottima ricostruzione storica norrena. La storia √® quella famosa di Amleto, ma il film √® godibilissimo."
"Nov 12, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I don't normally write reviews but I was shocked by the positive reviews of this movie. This is a bad movie not worth watching.  I wasn't really sure what this set out to achieve, and by the end I was just happy it was over.  Personally, I like dumb movies like Troy and 300.  I just couldn't get into this one."
"Nov 11, 2022",NEGATIVE,A ton of weird moments during this film.
"Nov 8, 2022",NEGATIVE,Don't waste your time.  The mystical Viking revenge storyline is so poorly executed here.  Character development is non-existent and there are so many gaps in this story.  We found this movie pathetic on many levels and the Viking angle couldn't even save it.
"Nov 7, 2022",NEGATIVE,"There is one thing every film maker must remember...characters the audience care about. No matter how authentic, how visually amazing, how star studded or epic, nothing matters if the audience fundamentally couldn't care less if the protagonists live or die. Zero character development renders this movie dull, soulless and utterly unengaging."
"Nov 6, 2022",NEUTRAL,"While the movie pulled me in I initially it couldn't hold me. The visuals were good. It seemed to follow a pretty standard formula, which gave it a generic feel at some points. And when they attempted to go beyond the shallow violence it seemed as if they were trying a little hard for something deep. 
Maybe worth 1 watch. While Eggers did a spot on job, it doesn't compare to the 2019 masterpiece ""The Lighthouse""
It was still good to see Willem Dafoe up to his shenanigans."
"Nov 5, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Maybe I was expecting too much but this was a complete waste of time. Nicole Kidman tries to have a weird accent and like all of the characters she's not developed enough for you to care about. I'm
It's been described as artsy and if that's code for terrible, you're going to love it. 
There's so big names in this movie but it doesn't deliver. 
It's disjointed. 
Badly acted. 
The scenery is nice. But these better YouTube videos out there is that's what you're after."
"Nov 4, 2022",NEGATIVE,Unbelievable boring. Great cast thou.
"Nov 3, 2022",NEGATIVE,"The film was mildly entertaining at times, but mostly disappointing.  It's much more fantasy than historical fiction.  The attempts at plot twists could be seen coming a mile away, and they threw in an unnecessary attempt at incest, most likely for Game of Thrones fans.  The film wasted too much time on drug hallucination and dream/vision scenes that added little real content. The final nude fight scene was absolutely ridiculous. For Viking historical fiction The Last Kingdom and History Channel's Vikings do a much better job."
"Nov 2, 2022",POSITIVE,"Epic, poetic, dazzling!"
"Oct 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"Eggers continues to really put you there with this one. The lands of the North are vivid and delightfully bleak. The journey of the Northman is textured and fraught with the perils of the life of a raider. Movies like this necessitate the existence of the medium, there is no replacement for the immersion here. Watch it."
"Oct 31, 2022",NEGATIVE,"A tangent laden third act took away from a solid chase story.  If you're here for Ethan Hawke or Willem Dafoe, don't blink.  It's viking violence and some moments might require you to look away from the screen.  There is also a supernatural element that didn't work for me and jettisoned me out of the film.  Well acted by some superstars, and a beautiful film, but it wasn't my cup of tea.  Final Score: 5/10"
"Oct 30, 2022",NEGATIVE,Horrible.  Lot of violence.  Lot of weird stuff that just made no sense.
"Oct 30, 2022",POSITIVE,Roger Eggers delivers once again and perhaps his best film. This is a great viking story that has a Shakespearian feel to it. Must watch and potential Movie of the year candidate.
"Oct 30, 2022",POSITIVE,I think its one of those where you love it or hate it. I loved it. If you embrace the weird and stylised offering from Robert Eggers its a thoroughly good time that feels like you are experiencing a true viking saga. I'll be thinking about this film for a while and listening to the score for at least the next week or so.
"Oct 30, 2022",NEUTRAL,Disappointing ending.
"Oct 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Not a movie I would normally pick to go see - the subject matter doesn't really interest me.  But once I started watching this, I was hooked.  It isn't a traditional action film - it is more a revenge soap opera bathed in blood and weird voodoo atmosphere.  There are parts that are slow, but the pacing is mostly awesome.  They maybe overdid it with the voodoo vision quest junk, and the audio was not great, but overall well acted and directed right up to its blood and body oil soaked conclusion.
I also appreciated the more nuanced plotline that goes beyond just kill the guy that killed my dad.  That that act of revenge will have its own consequences.  And Skarsgard is FINALLY in a movie that doesn't suck."
"Oct 29, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Confusing
Movie likes itself a lot"
"Oct 29, 2022",NEGATIVE,Entirely too much barking for a movie not about dogs. I can't believe they got these actors to be in it.
"Oct 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Artistic, Gorgeous, and rich sound encapsulated vengeance in a tale that is unforgettable. Not an action film, more of an epic tale of animalistic revenge. Primal, visceral"
"Oct 29, 2022",NEUTRAL,"If you liked Vikings, you will most likely enjoy this. Quite the cast, acting is mostly fairly solid. Plot plods along in parts (well, it is 2 2/2 hours long‚Ä¶), with some decent cinematography and a few bloody battles."
"Oct 29, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I liked this movie, but boy is it heavy. I like my movies to make me feel hopeful and inspired at the end and this movie does not do that. It is a gritty telling of a Viking prince who seeks revenge for what happened to him and his family. I like gritty movies and I like historical fiction, so I am going to like this movie. I liked it the first time I watched it, but I won't watch it again. Its just too depressing."
"Oct 28, 2022",NEGATIVE,This movie was slow...not enough action.
"Oct 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"This really is a good movie if you are in to the Vikings and Norse mythology.  While admittedly violent,  it has a classic revenge story that anyone who loves those old Clint Eastwood movies would appreciate.

There are also a bunch of top notch actors in this movie and cinematics are excellent. I highly recommend it."
"Oct 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"I really felt immersed during this movie, great action and an intriguing story."
"Oct 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"This movie is one of the best of the year. I like the idea that Robert Eggers was given a big budget so that he can tell his story but I also understand why this wasn't a banger at the Box Office. It is just not meant for the normal easy viewer but more for the Art House and Movie appreciation Audience. Nevertheless, for me this movie was Insane. The classic revenge story combined with the Viking methodology was great. And the Action ahhhh the Action was dirty and realistic in some ways. I came out of the movie full of energy and I was pumped. The cinematography is also top-tier. So if you appreciate movies that are sometimes slower and not easy to watch please go watch this movie."
"Oct 27, 2022",NEGATIVE,"The critics seem to be assessing the behind the scenes people who brought the movie to the screen and giving it high scores.  For someone who has none of that expertise, or snobbery, and just wants to watch a great viking movie, I found it lacking in all the areas important to me.  I was 10 minutes in before I had to take a break for a couple of hours, too much howling like dogs for me. I didn't connect with any of the characters at all ever, and wasn't impressed with all the howling and carry on.  I like a good spirit journey as much as the next person, I just get tired of the relentlessness of this one.  It's a revenge movie and the outcome was obvious from the first scene when Nicole's character raised her hand to hit the boy prince, before reining herself in.  Of course it couldn't have followed any other path to the finale but I wasn't in the mood for Shakespeare.  I wonder if Prince Harry has watched it yet?"
"Oct 26, 2022",NEUTRAL,"It's visually stunning, and the cast is wonderful, but it's tedious. Really long and repetitive. Still, worth a look."
"Oct 26, 2022",NEGATIVE,I got about 20 minutes into this movie before I turned it off what a stupid dumb movie I should just not watch any original programming on Amazon Prime because all of it sucks except for the boys. Also when I seen Ethan Hawke in it I knew I should have turned it off because he has never done a good movie and he's a terrible actor. Never name one good movie with Ethan Hawke there isn't one
"Oct 26, 2022",NEGATIVE,"The ending was lame, and the entire movie was just flat. I love the Vikings and the Last Kingdom series, but this one was just a bland and boring story. Definitely a no for me."
"Oct 26, 2022",NEGATIVE,This movie was horrible.  With all the viking viewing choices available this one was not good.  I watched this on HBO last night.  I like the lead actors in it.  But Netflix Vikings Valhalla was way better than this and didnt have any of the A list actors.  Either the writing or directing ruined this film.
"Oct 26, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Is it possible to have worse acting, the computer graphics are laughably fake, the story is hilariously bad. This movie is as bad  as caddy shack 2"
"Oct 25, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Watch the trailer. The trailer was good, the movie was not! The problem is that the trailer made you think that you were going to see a cool movie set in the distant past with an interesting story. What you get in the actual movie is a comic book-level film best suited for 10 to 12 year old boys that can sneak away and watch an R rated  ""superhero type fantasy flic"" without their parent's knowledge. 
Hallucinogenic imagery may also appeal to trippers and stoners that left reality a long time ago. But, this film isn't for adults. It is beyond silly and childish. It is a shame. It could have been great! All it needed was a good script writer to write the exact same story for an audience of grownups that aren't tripping... and they could have had a real winner of a film!"
"Oct 25, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I had high hopes for this movie, sadly I was very wrong. Terrible script, ridiculous CGI,not to mention that apparently Vikings had access to Botox.Two+ hours that I'm never getting back :/"
"Oct 25, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Violent for violence sake.
I got bored and didn't watch to the end.
This is the sort of film which desensitises people."
"Oct 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"I liked the soundtracks, the movie is not bad like many say."
"Oct 24, 2022",POSITIVE,Certainly not everyone's cup of tea but I can't help but love such a visceral depiction of old sagas. Modern sensibilities and morality are refreshingly absent in a story about the violent life of a viking berserker.
"Oct 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"Por primera vez estoy de acuerdo con los cr√≠ticos del sitio, es una de las mejores pel√≠culas del a√±o. Sin duda la pel√≠cula en una inmersi√≥n en el mundo vikingo."
"Oct 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I'm getting so tired of critics giving thumbs up to lame movies because of the director's previous reputation!!!

This revenge epic earned favorable reviews, yet it features one-dimensional characters, clunking dialog, a pretentious plot ripped from Hamlet, and inept, underwhelming fight scenes.

The long and short is: even though there isn't a shred of humor in this film, much of it is unintentionally humorous. In fact, it makes even the most mundane episode of the TV series Viking seem like Ibsen.

Anya Taylor-Joy really needs to choose her projects more carefully!"
"Oct 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"Conan the Barbarian meets Vikings. An entertaining  (if we'll trodden) story, well paced, beautifully shot with a strong cast. 

A Friday night, beer and pizza special."
"Oct 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Not a single believable character in the whole movie, the dialogue was pretentious to the point of stupidity and even that was delivered in 'husky whispers' making it both annoying and even more unbelievable. Very, very disappointing."
"Oct 22, 2022",NEGATIVE,"The Northman is a viking epic that didn't quite stick the landing. The cinematography in this is absolutely stunning, gorgeously shot and well made. I found this rather boring and didn't appreciate it as much because I am not too familiar with viking lore. So some of the story choices I didn't like and this movie is unevenly paced. Tries to be half art film, half mainstream revenge flick. I can say that I am not a fan of director Robert Eggers after seeing all 3 films of his. This is pretentious and studios will think twice before ever giving him a 70 million dollar budget again. The few fight sequences that they did have were stylishly filmed, but there's not enough of it. I like actor Alexander Sarsgaard, but feel like he was too old for this role. Nicole Kidman is playing his mother and she's only 9 years older in real life. The ending was totally unsatisfying and that's why I gave it an even lower score than what i would have originally given it."
"Oct 22, 2022",POSITIVE,The graphics and storyline were great! I just hated to see him die at the end. Apologies if I spoiled it!
"Oct 22, 2022",NEGATIVE,"The overall narrative is lost in the weirdness of this movie. The action however, is amazing but the fight at the end is stupid."
"Oct 21, 2022",POSITIVE,Brutal and barbaric. One hell of a ride.
"Oct 21, 2022",NEGATIVE,"What is there to like about this movie. The acting is terrible. The plot has been overdone many times. Blood and gore and senseless howling and yelling. I kept watching in hopes that it would get better. However, it did not. I would not watch this movie again if I was paid to do so."
"Oct 21, 2022",NEGATIVE,This is the worst Viking show I've ever seen
"Oct 20, 2022",POSITIVE,"A truly phenomenal retelling of Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"".  Skarsgard as Amleth is a smoldering burn of rage and confusion.  Anya Taylor-Joy as Olga continues to prove she is a powerhouse of acting as well as a nebulous beauty on the screen.  Ethan Hawke & Claes Bang were remarkably good as the king and his usurping brother.  And Willem Dafoe again displays his creepy, engaging, wonderful style (last seen in The Lighthouse!).  I really liked Nicole Kidman as Amleth's mother, Gudrun; she is beautiful, pathetic, violent, and vengeful.  Really wonderful.  The movie is particularly gorey but the gore is part of the authenticity of the story and contributes to the hellish choice Amleth makes at the end.  One wonders (w/o giving too many spoilers) does the prince make the right decision in the end?  Director Robert Eggers takes a much darker and cynical view of the story than Shakespeare and far more pagan and prbbly far more true to life; read some of those Norse sagas and you get an idea of the constant cycle of revenge that infected pagan Norse culture.  And that alone is why this movie is so intriguing.  It doesn't try to give some namby-pamby milquetoast message of social justice but rather asks what life might be like without a defiance of augury.  What happens when we reject the special providence in the fall of a sparrow and seek instead to right the wrongs of the world by our own bloody hands?  Can the ocean of violence be overcome by more violence?  At what point must Amleth state that he has shot his arrow over his house and has hit his brother?  And if he doesn't, is it sufficient reward to dwell in Valhalla until the darkness of Ragnarok consumes all?  Hard to tell what Eggers thinks - but he certainly presents the question well in a violent, dark, engaging and magnificent story."
"Oct 20, 2022",POSITIVE,"Wow! A slow burner that managed to keep me glued to the screen.
A revenge story with amazing acting and cinematography. 
It was especially impressive on the big screen!
Probably my favourite of the year"
"Oct 20, 2022",NEUTRAL,"It's both reassuring and disappointing that when a director as singular as Robert Eggars is let loose to play with a big budget and big names, the result is still singular in style even if the bones of the plot (such as it is) give us what amounts to a pretty conventional revenge story. It's reassuring in that it's important that distinctive voices maintain their edge, disappointing in that it surely wouldn't have compromised his vision too much to make a few concessions to those who come to this expecting something more conventional. 

I really liked the bold, unsettling The Witch; I was much less taken than many by the wilful alienation of The Lighthouse. I'm between the two with The Northman. At times visually extraordinary, at other times this feels like it's almost too concerned with proving this is still a Robert Eggars film. It approaches the hoary ground of style over substance; are we actually allowed room to feel and think? Are the actors given any space to breathe complexity into the characters? I suspect the answers to both those questions err towards 'no'. 

When it works well, it flies high and shows off what could have been; other times it feels all surface, no feeling ... and, worst of all, a little bit dull."
"Oct 20, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Such a waste of time, very graphical"
"Oct 19, 2022",NEUTRAL,"once i realized i didn't like it because i believed it to be real, i also realized it had sucked me in almost 100%. still, i thought more than once; ""hmm, this is what happens when it's cold & wet all the time, and you have never heard of reading, writing, mathematics, and electricity. weird thoughts, i know."
"Oct 19, 2022",NEGATIVE,I'd give it zero stars if I could.
"Oct 19, 2022",NEGATIVE,It's like watching WWE when it comes to the fighting.
"Oct 19, 2022",NEGATIVE,This movie is corny as hell. Everything about it is irritating.
"Oct 18, 2022",POSITIVE,"This movie is a work of bloody art! Literally. CGI and special effects work was very good to spectacular. Characters are believable . The acting is excellent. They are portraying flawed humans in a long dead culture and pull it off. You connect with them. I felt they held true to Norse mythos. The dialogue is a little challenging at times, but give it some thought and in relation to the scene and story arc and you will piece it together. The only nit pick I have is the Valkyrie had braces... But hey who knew Vikings had an excellent dental plan. Watch it and enjoy the scenery, rage and vengence."
"Oct 18, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Wasn't expecting the movie to be that engaging but had my full attention. Loved the soundtracks and the way Vikings have been portrayed. Liked the theatrical style monologues.
Wish some of the characters were a bit more medieval like makeup wise.
Fight scenes could've been better."
"Oct 18, 2022",POSITIVE," am someone who tries real hard not to buy into the hype of things. I understand movies are good but, like a new shiny toy, every movie seems to be the greatest thing in the world until the next new movie comes around. I knew that this was hyped up and I figured I was going to like it and probably give it a 3.5 - 4 star rating. Well, to me, The Northman is legit a 5 star movie. It has everything I look for in a movie and checks off every box for my criteria of what I want to see. It‚Äôs perfectly dark and twisted, even bizarre at times. There‚Äôs action and gore and awesome dialogue throughout. The Northman is the reason why I love movies and it reminded me of that. That it‚Äôs ok to just love a movie. I do believe The Northman is definitely not for everyone, and I can see areas where others wouldn‚Äôt get it or just not what they are into. Also, like any movie, certain things could happen without a build up and make the 2+ hour movie into 15 minutes, but then we wouldn‚Äôt be here talking about anything."
"Oct 18, 2022",POSITIVE,"The symbolism in this wonderful film is quite lovely.  Joseph Campbell, author of ""the power of the myth"", would have been thrilled about this Movie for certain"
"Oct 18, 2022",POSITIVE,A blood for blood movie. Loved it. Captured by choice for revenge.
"Oct 17, 2022",POSITIVE,"Even though the story is very bare bones, Robert Eggers brings in fantastic visuals with great details that it is still a joy to watch. There are so many interesting shots that leave the viewer questioning what reality is. Although that can lead to a bit of confusion, I was still able to keep up with the ideas presented. The acting in this film was amazing all around. I really enjoyed Nicole Kidman and Alexander Skarsg√•rd performances. The romantic relationship between Alexander Skarsg√•rd and Anya Taylor-Joy did feel a little half baked and underdeveloped though. The action in this movie is few and far between, but when it does peak its head out it in brutal and visceral leaving audiences gasping at the bloody details and gore. The action was done really well, with not many cuts and incredible choreography. Overall, this film was really great and I wish I would have watched it in the theaters.

Score: 87%
Verdict: Excellent"
"Oct 17, 2022",POSITIVE,Exreamly well shot and intense movie. Slow burn that builds to a great climax!
"Oct 16, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I thought this was going to be another epic movie with huge battles, glory, and vengeance.  It wasn't. The weird religious and incest overtones was too much."
"Oct 16, 2022",NEGATIVE,"This movie is by far the worst movie in the history of Vikings movies, I've been a fan of Vikings my entire life but the horrible acting the cringed makes it all a true sad disappointment of a movie."
"Oct 16, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Visuals outstanding, plot muddled. Very dark, both visually and mentally. Scene where hero gets THE sword is right out of Indiana Jones."
"Oct 15, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Honestly it's exactly what you'd expect from an Eggers Viking film. A slow burn, violent, beautifully filmed flick that won't be for everyone. For those who's wheelhouse it is in, you'll love it."
"Oct 15, 2022",NEGATIVE,A movie where you don't like any of the characters and you won't care if any of them live or die.
"Oct 15, 2022",POSITIVE,Absolutely beautiful to look at and also brutal to watch! Loved it!
"Oct 15, 2022",POSITIVE,"This movie isn't a straight historical drama. It's a mythology enshrined epic featuring supernatural aspects to the tale. It's the kind of story a Viking would tell another Viking, not something you would read in a history book. Visually it was beautiful, almost psychedelic at times, the kind of gore infested shamanic trip you'd expect from a berserker themed story.  The acting was wonderful and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Not a happy movie per se but definitely one worth watching. I wish more movies were this good."
"Oct 15, 2022",POSITIVE,isnt bad as People think Honestly
"Oct 15, 2022",NEGATIVE,")
Absolutely terrible. Made me consider canceling my prime membership."
"Oct 15, 2022",NEUTRAL,Could have been  epic but needed significant editing. One time watch.
"Oct 15, 2022",NEGATIVE,"The sets and settings are beautiful, but there is almost no character development and therefore a complete waste of some pretty good actors. It just seems like a movie made for slashing and gashing."
"Oct 14, 2022",POSITIVE,"This movie was excellent. I appreciated how they weaved fantasy into the movie without making it unbelievable. While there were some flaws in the movie, the movie was suspenseful and entertaining and the ending was so moving!"
"Oct 14, 2022",POSITIVE,"Very immersive, gritty, visual spectacle that really shows the aspect of the barbarian warriors of those eastern countries."
"Oct 14, 2022",POSITIVE,"Whilst the first 10 minutes may be a bit arty for some, the movie as a whole is phenomenal, and I'd urge anyone to stick with it. Like a work ripped straight out of an original saga, truly epic."
"Oct 14, 2022",NEGATIVE,I think I enjoy clipping my toenails more than watching this movie. The casting was terrible - so the mom (Nicole Kidman) had the son when she was 9? And the Northman's love interest is young enough to be his daughter (ugh). The accents were dreadful and the plot was predictable and tiresome. Only plus was seeing the Iceland landscape and some male nudity.
"Oct 13, 2022",NEUTRAL,"This was a visually stunning, well-acted, well-directed, and beautiful piece of art. However, I had so many people over-hype this movie that it just couldn't live up to the reputation that preceded it."
"Oct 12, 2022",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie, make more like this."
"Oct 12, 2022",NEGATIVE,That movie was terrible.  The dialogue was bad and the plot made no sense.
"Oct 12, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Even though there are some recognizable visuals, the film is poorly written, the story foreseeable and the directing and acting couldn‚Äòt be worse. If anyone is looking for quality entertainment, it‚Äòs best to save the time and look elsewhere."
"Oct 10, 2022",POSITIVE,"An outstanding Viking movie based off of Shakespear's Hamlet.  If you are looking for a Norse ""300"" you are sure to be disappointed.  If you are looking for a more realistic Viking tale you are in luck.  Dark, violent but an incredibly well-made movie.  There are not many movies of this quality out there, and I appreciate the hard work that went into making it a reality."
"Oct 8, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Fresh. Great acting (mostly), great direction!"
"Oct 8, 2022",NEGATIVE,awful. dont watch it
"Oct 8, 2022",POSITIVE,"Ancient and beautiful, Violent and yet meaningful to the story. Unique and refreshing among the current Hollywood trends. This wasn't a movie made for the sake of gratuitous violence. Every moment told a story. It was a pleasure to see that Hollywood can still make an epic mythological-like tale that felt real, yet magical, with imagery befitting dark poetry. I could not find fault in any of it and I'm a pretty hard viewer to please.  If I had any critical points at all it was that 'Amleth' sounds a bit too much like 'Hamlet', and the story is similar as well, but whether that was intentional or not, matters little to me. It was a well-told story, with a good script, beautiful CGI and cinematography, and very well-acted by all the cast and it was wonderful to see some famous faces in this movie branch out into something so unique. I was hesitant at first to view it based on some of the reviews about how violent it was, but honestly, I've seen far worse than this movie. If violence is the only thing stopping you from viewing it, reconsider. It's worth it. It's cinematic art."
"Oct 7, 2022",POSITIVE,"This overwhelming art film is a bit different from what someone whould normally except out of a revenge story, nevertheless it has tense moments and ends in a powerful catharsis."
"Oct 6, 2022",NEGATIVE,"It was utterly wasted time and money, the worst so called Viking film. Very disappointed"
"Oct 6, 2022",POSITIVE,"Brutal, violent yet a compelling watch about betrayal, revenge and love. Combined elements of Viking mysticism with adventure and action in a movie that sucks you in and doesn't let you go until the very end."
"Oct 6, 2022",NEUTRAL,It's a cross between an A24 movie and a parody of an A24 movie. Incredible single shots and artistic visuals. Terrible accents.
"Oct 4, 2022",NEUTRAL,A straight-up great revenge movie with swords!
"Oct 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,"It was watchable and just barely above passable.  I almost would have liked a bit of a turn for the protagonist but that wasn't going to happen out of A24

Not one of the better flicks to come out of that studio but it was better than the average stuff.

It is crazy violent but then considering the subject matter how could it not be"
"Oct 1, 2022",POSITIVE,"It's a treasure of the epic language translated for cinema. Great story, great interpretation, and visually astonishing!"
"Sep 29, 2022",NEGATIVE,Slow-moving and juvenile. The acting was so bad I ended up questioning whether this was a spoof or was serious. The imagery was simplistic yet overstated. The production quality was very poor as well - hard to believe this was intended for theaters.
"Sep 28, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Crap movie. I was actually on my phone for the final thirty minutes looking the reviews to confirm my thoughts. Then it came to the final  few scenes where it was wrapping up the already-bland story and that was an utter disappointment. The best part of the movie was with the first five minutes with Willem DeFoe and the obviously over-choreographed battle. The rest was filled with long, pointless scenes that didn't contribute at all to the plot. An action revenge story with no action. Very disappointed, wish I could get my money back. If you value your time here on Earth, do not watch"
"Sep 28, 2022",NEGATIVE,"The cast was great, the scenery was brilliant and the cinematography was amazing. Unfortunately the plot was an utter flatline, no character development of any kind or suspense and an ending that could be seen coming from several hundred miles away."
"Sep 28, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Impressing visuals, great casting, amazing soundtrack and incredible atmosphere.
It's nice to see some more historically accurate vikings, instead of the clean, sanitized ones that permeated Hollywood in more recent productions."
"Sep 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Inflatable Skarsg√•rdüí™.
"Sep 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,Solid movie with great actors and visuals but I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs anything special.
"Sep 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great movie!  Not for the squeamish, for sure.  It's a Nordic revenge tale, so what's not to like??"
"Sep 25, 2022",NEGATIVE,"So boring. I know when the critics like it, I'm going to hate it. Definitely great camera work and fits the dark and gritty look it's going for, but so slow and boring. It was just not a fun watch. Not everything has to be that, but at least keep my attention."
"Sep 25, 2022",NEGATIVE,Story is pure vomit. I was so frustrated to watch such an awful movie with so much nonsence
"Sep 25, 2022",POSITIVE,Great movie! Plot was very well developed
"Sep 25, 2022",POSITIVE,"Based on the original tale that inspired Hamlet, you'll find yourself constantly worried about the characters what wondering what drives men to hate. Very enjoyable."
"Sep 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,"This was the worst movie I've seen. With so many good actors one think it could be magnificent, but it's a pain to see. Not worth the time. Just awful."
"Sep 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"Interesting, yet sometimes disturbing plot. The costume design and the settings were fantastic. Skarsg√•rd didn't really work for me, but Kidman and Bang had such a dark layer to their character that they made quite intriguing villains."
"Sep 24, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I enjoyed The Northman despite some serious issues. Visually stunning and continuously interesting like his previous films, but extremely slow paced with some odd directing choices that feel careless or lazy. However, still definitely worth a watch.  I'll probably watch again."
"Sep 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"Loved every minute of this film. Blending the gritty realism of the time with myth and magic of the Norse Gods, it's a feast for the eyes and ears. I truly do not understand the negative reviews. Truly.  I'm merely sad that they didn't enjoy it as much as I. I loved The Witch and The Lighthouse too so Eggers is a star to me.  I don't have a ""favorite,"" they each deal with different themes and styles of story telling.  But he proved himself again to be a master at his craft. The writing is perfect , the acting perfect, the visuals perfect, the story perfect.  Simple yet divine.  A+ for me."
"Sep 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Made by professionals, but this movie screams out ""amateur"". Great sets do not a great movie make."
"Sep 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,This movie was shaping up to be the worst film I had ever seen until I decided to pretend it was meant to be a comedy. It worked and I couldn't stop laughing at it.
"Sep 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,This movie movie was very airy dark headed had a pretty decent story Also there was a lot of things things are overdone and left dangling
"Sep 22, 2022",NEGATIVE,This was just boring
"Sep 21, 2022",POSITIVE,Really enjoyed this movie. It seemed more on the artistic side. It might not be for everyone but was quite good and I liked seeing the famous actors in the film.
"Sep 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"A visual marvel like few others. It might not be the most original story, but the execution of this movie is so utterly perfect that I was completely blown away by its beauty and grandiosity. A cinematic spectacle in the most EPIC way."
"Sep 21, 2022",NEUTRAL,Probably one of the most average movies I have seen in a while.  Probably could have cut 30 minutes out of this movie very easily and it would have been far more enjoyable.  I am all about gore and violence but they may have gone a tad bit overboard at parts here.  Worth a watch though over anything else coming out these days.
"Sep 20, 2022",NEGATIVE,"The  Northman was a huge disappointment, this is the first film that I have ever felt the need too fast forward in hope it would suddenly improve, and no, it did not , such weak acting and basic storyline."
"Sep 20, 2022",POSITIVE,"In particular I love how the mysticism/mythos was woven into the story. Not overdone, not underdone. Perfect balance. Some complain that there was not enough  violence/action some say the opposite. I thought the movie was fantastic."
"Sep 20, 2022",NEGATIVE,Poor Story‚Ä¶ waste of time seriously!!!
"Sep 19, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I didn't think it'd be possible to make a boring movie about Vikings, but here we are...

From the first opening scene, I thought it resembled The Lighthouse, and The Witch. Afterwards i looked it up and realized they are all the same director. He certainly has a style, and really enjoyed it for The Lighthouse.....and sort of for the Witch. 

This movie looks great. I'ts creepy and dark, uses black and white here and there to good effect. The actors tower, and look imposing. The violence scenes are gruesome and fun to watch...when they happen. And thats the problem

This is a viking movie with virtually no viking activities. Aside from the opening scene, there are no battles. There is no raiding/pillaging. There is no running wild in England and ransacking Churches. It is a slow.....very slow revenge story, with a mystical element intertwined. He grows from a boy to a man, covertly becomes a respected member of his target's clan, and lives amongst them for years it seems till he ultimately gets his revenge. 

This movie is book ended with violence, and almost the entire middle is meandering nonsense, all while beautifully shot at least.

He knows how to make a good looking movie, they just aren't always enjoyable(The Northmen), and certainly even if you enjoy them, they aren't fun to watch(The witch, or Lighthouse)."
"Sep 19, 2022",NEGATIVE,"first 45 mins was not bad. Nicole Kidman ruined it mostly(acting) but the thing that annoyed me is old Norse saying ''meet me at the gates of hel''  from a Norseman then they go to a volcano, as if they are trying to drag in Christians hell of fire and mixing it with Norse hel (Niflheim) pretty much opposite to what it is. even if they had the meaning of the goddess hel it still makes no sense. then taken by a Valkyrie. ending was pretty rubbish. it was like dragging a body for views. worth the watch but i wouldnt watch it again. i was actually looking foreward to watching it. Skarsg√•rd Hawke and Dafoe great as usual."
"Sep 18, 2022",NEUTRAL,"A dark gritty movie which i enjoyed, but it is not for everyone"
"Sep 18, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Authentic Viking movie with stunning cinematography. Alexander Skarsg√•rd and Claes Bang are superb. However, it is slower than expected and the best parts are in the trailer."
"Sep 18, 2022",POSITIVE,Absolutely Fantastic and true to history/time period
"Sep 17, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Junk movie , dont waste your time ! Boring and match reviews..."
"Sep 17, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Too abstract to be a coherent story.

This is a gore fest without any understandable storyline. The mythological elements dominate the movie, rather than being an addition to the main plot.

Basically if you don't want plot, be consistently confused, but want to see men at their worst then watch this film."
"Sep 17, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Got to be one of the worst Movies I've ever seen.
Plot was dreadful, storyline awful, very poor acting, pitiful screenplay.
If I had paid to rent I would have turned it off.
Whoever thinks this film is ""Artsy"" must be on the same mushrooms they fed to the guards in the film."
"Sep 17, 2022",POSITIVE,"Before anything else, I would say this cast is near perfect.  To see Alexander Skarsgard goes from a bit more lanky in True Blood to bulking up in this film was more then a shock.  This film in itself is a shock to the system in that it is not like other films I have seen.  The cinematography is very well done.  In some ways it reminds me of Alfred Hitchcock's film Rope in that it had very few cuts.  Many one shot scenes makes everything make look much more visceral then what we were ready for. I liken it to a less Hollywood version of Vikings.  It is not afraid to get it's hands dirty. None of the characters are weak in any sense. Each have their own place and are used well.  I could try and ready you for this film but anything I would say may fall short because there is just so much to take in with it.  Quite the ride to take though I would recommend leaving the kids at home for this one."
"Sep 16, 2022",NEGATIVE,I'm sorry for myself to watch this high-budget video! There is no story and the characters have no depth. The actors are terrible and the fight scenes are actually funny! The director tried to mash sin city with every other fantasy movie and it turned out to be a garbage mix of scenes they call a movie! It is an insult to human intelligence.
"Sep 16, 2022",POSITIVE,"This was a really good, realistic movie about the Viking era, be warned its not an epic feel good like Braveheart or Gladiator, its much more realistic and true to the times. Know that before going in to it and you will enjoy it much more. Fantastic!"
"Sep 15, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Please stop putting Nicole Kidman in movies, she cannot act."
"Sep 15, 2022",NEGATIVE,"There is nothing more nordic than half naked men fighting for family justice! Oh wait... It could be a good movie with a more detailed story line, but as his mother threw him over the fence, so did the producers to us.
Too bad that this budget was not enough for a decent movie in a scenic view and good actors."
"Sep 15, 2022",POSITIVE,"Don't walk into this thinking your getting a Viking war movie.  This is an amazing and stunningly original take on Viking mythology told on the platform of revenge, religion, and brutality."
"Sep 15, 2022",NEGATIVE,You have to be a simple minded dense individual to think this is a good movie. 
"Sep 14, 2022",NEGATIVE,Honestly had no idea what half the dialogue meant in this tbh
"Sep 13, 2022",POSITIVE,"Been long waiting for a movie like this to come out!! Brutal, intense & faithful to Vikings history! Doesn't sanitize it's action or story. The fact that this movie didn't get the credit it should've is criminal!"
"Sep 13, 2022",NEGATIVE,"They didn't focus on the storytelling, they just tried make it artsy bs movie"
"Sep 12, 2022",POSITIVE,The Northman is an epic bloody revenge movie with really amazing cinematography and great cast and directing.
"Sep 11, 2022",POSITIVE,"A true norse epic. Definitely not for everyone, BUT MY GOD every frame truly was a painting. It was definitely a vibes-based movie where you didn't come for the story or characters as those weren't that interesting (aside from a few specific instances), but the sound and cinematography and just the general feel and pace of the movie were extremely compelling and had me hooked the entire movie."
"Sep 11, 2022",POSITIVE,Nothing short of incredible film making
"Sep 11, 2022",POSITIVE,"Wow, what a movie. It makes Hamlet look silly and excessively hesitant. The story and the visual and audio artistry is fierce, dark, and beautiful with its mythology and its Iceland scenery. The female characters are strong forces the men should heed‚Ä¶but don't‚Ä¶ which leads to the inevitable end. The music, the language and the darkness make this a haunting story, a revenge of sorts on the bard who adapted this story and tried to tame it. The real version is raw ‚Äî and so that much more believable."
"Sep 11, 2022",POSITIVE,"A true viking story, great writing and acting.
The visuals, sound and effects are immersive. 
We need more movies like this."
"Sep 10, 2022",NEUTRAL,The hype of the film promised alot but delivered little to none
"Sep 10, 2022",NEGATIVE,This ain't got nothing on the great ‚ÄòVikings' TV show.
"Sep 10, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Buena pel√≠cula, los giros en la historia te van a atrapar. Pienso que hubo algo que falt√≥, a√∫n no se que... Pero a√∫n as√≠ pienso que es buena y recomendable."
"Sep 9, 2022",NEGATIVE,It dragged - it was filled with dreary darkness and lots of ritual chanting.  Did I say it d...r...a...g...g...e...d?  I have no idea why Nicole Kidman agreed to waste her time in this film - she had a miniscule part.
"Sep 9, 2022",POSITIVE,"This is a story where you can ""relax"" because there is no political agenda mixed in. Finally just a story for the sake of the story. I really enjoyed it and recommend it to friends."
"Sep 9, 2022",POSITIVE,"Robert Eggers delivers the most brutal, epic viking movie to date!"
"Sep 8, 2022",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie! If it was made in a different time it would have won awards. If you know why, then you know."
"Sep 8, 2022",POSITIVE,Me gust√≥ la historia üëå
"Sep 7, 2022",NEGATIVE,"um....what?....if you like gore and art house story plots that drag on with confusing endings, this film is for you."
"Sep 7, 2022",POSITIVE,this is a beautiful revenge movie that starts slow but gets better as it goes with some brutal moments
"Sep 7, 2022",NEUTRAL,"This movie was fantastic. The plot is based off the original Shakespeare story, Hamlet, but it is executed perfectly. I found the cast to be amazing as well as the cinematography. The cinematography was beautiful and badass. There was a lot of creepy and gruesome elements to the film as well. Overall a must see film."
"Sep 7, 2022",POSITIVE,"Solid performance by all.  Lighting was a little too dark for some scenes.  Had a very ""Frank Miller"" comic feel.  I imagine the film is based on Nordic folklore and if so its themes can be found in many cultures.  Like the bow, which developed on different continents by different people who could have at no time interacted there are some feelings and thoughts that remain universal."
"Sep 6, 2022",POSITIVE,"The visual aesthetics, performances, and writing in this film are fantastic. It captures the spirit of Norse mythology and the sagas very well. Attention to detail is especially welcome in terms of historical accuracy. Few works of TV and film are as faithful to the Viking era as this.

The lower user ratings tend to come from peope who were expecting a more straight forward and generic action flick. The tone of this film is far more Shakespearean and serious which may not be everyone's cup of tea. Personally I loved it and was fully immersed in the world presented on screen. In an age of lazy film-making and CGI-infested cash grabs, we need more films like this."
"Sep 6, 2022",POSITIVE,Full of blood and guts. The Northman is a true viking film that its powerful emotion can't be denied as strong and resourceful.
"Sep 5, 2022",NEGATIVE,Indie movie with a budget.. if it were half as good as the trailer it would have been awesome.
"Sep 5, 2022",POSITIVE,"saga of Midgard, heroes journey, Norse mythology, badass spectacular film"
"Sep 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,Very bloody with a weak plot.
"Sep 5, 2022",NEGATIVE,Too just too weird with mostly unlikeable characters. When I want some Viking gore I'll just rewatch The 13th Warrior.
"Sep 5, 2022",NEGATIVE,"The Northman is a film that tries to visualize the Vikings' fundamental beliefs with fantastic things. But even though it has good visuals, the story bored me because of the choice of story's progress. I was seriously bored, especially in the movie's second half, because of those ups and downs. Unfortunately, I watched a much calmer movie than expected. I expected a wilder, more aggressive, and gruesome film. Can't say anything to the acting, the shooting. All great. But for me, the most essential thing that makes a movie a movie is the script. Director Eggers, unfortunately, remained weak in narration while making his style speak. The film, which will hit the hearts of those who care about visuals, seems to upset those who focus on the story, like me."
"Sep 5, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great movie. A rare movie these days that is depicted historically accurate without the injection of current politics and wokeness.
This should be celebrated. Throw your money at this."
"Sep 5, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I liked some of the cinematography, but this movie sucked.  If you like this type of film, watch the series The Last Kingdom or Game of Thrones and avoid this one."
"Sep 4, 2022",POSITIVE,"Realistic fighting scenes, maybe not as acrobatic as we are used to lately, but focused on how the fights would probably broke through."
"Sep 4, 2022",NEGATIVE,"A bit slow needed more gore and less weird ""praying"""
"Sep 4, 2022",POSITIVE,"One of the best movies of 2022. Great effects, fight sequences, and stunning depiction of Vikings."
"Sep 4, 2022",POSITIVE,"northman is a incredible, epic history of vengance that explores perfectly the nordic mitology. in my opinion is a great adventure with amazing ending. The Northman is a MASTERPIECE."
"Sep 4, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Went into the film expecting it to be grand and entertaining. Did not meet any of my expectations whatsoever as it turned out to be a dull and small revenge story. There is no character build in any of the characters, even if you can understand the leads motive of wanting revenge it still adds nothing. Some of the dialogues were straight up cringy."
"Sep 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,"The Gladiator with Vikings. Not as good as The Gladiator though, but it has some amazing visuals and is well worth it. Recommend watching it while enjoying a dram of Highland Park or Ardbeg whisky."
"Sep 3, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Unwatchable.  Terrible. 
Let's see...bad acting. To say everyone was overacting and chewing  scenery is to understate. Note to director: screaming is not powerful.  A scream is different than a roar.  Pigs scream.. Lions roar.  Plot...and outcome...done better elsewhere. This succeeds in making mythic storytelling into something small, dirty and silly. 
This is a poor reproduction of Schwarzenegger in Conan with none of the grandeur,  wonder or magic. Put on Conan the Barbarian.. Go watch that."
"Sep 3, 2022",POSITIVE,Captivating story with a satisfying ending. Rarely has pacing issues and always keeps the story moving.
"Sep 2, 2022",POSITIVE,Amazing!!!! I loved that the movie really held true to the time period and didn't make all the Vikings from the LGBTQ community.  Refreshing to see a movie with no political agenda.
"Sep 2, 2022",POSITIVE,A powerful revenge story with quite a few disorienting elements.  I was mesmerized and sort of uncomfortable throughout for reasons I couldn't always explain.
"Sep 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,Kinda of anticlimactic
"Sep 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I liked it!, but weird, but good.
Chillingly good, Weird. 
Yeah, did I say Weird?"
"Sep 2, 2022",POSITIVE,"Incredible movie! The imagery was perfect, the cast was perfect, and this director is quickly becoming one of my favorites after this movie and The Witch."
"Sep 2, 2022",NEGATIVE,"It's too slow , good photography , an interesting look at Norse myth ..."
"Sep 2, 2022",POSITIVE,"Well made, magnificently written and beautifully shot. It is a bold film that may not be everbody's cup of tea, but is definitely worth the watch."
"Sep 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Robert Eggers' unique filmmaking style finds its way into Norse mythology as his latest feature is a Viking epic. Alexander Skarsg√•rd and Anya Taylor-Joy shine in this brutal tale of betrayal, and while the film's visuals are impeccable, their performances are ultimately the best part of it. I'm not a fan of The Lighthouse or The VVitch but I must admit The Northman was actually a good movie."
"Sep 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Good movie, acting is not perfect that his weakness."
"Sep 2, 2022",NEGATIVE,Dreary and violent.  Hated it.
"Sep 1, 2022",POSITIVE,Damn!! It was awesome seeing what inspired Shakespeare to write Hamlet‚Ä¶
"Sep 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Dislike this movie.
A obviously ending story with bad special effects, poor quality image, normal performance for some great actors.
A waste of time and money!"
"Sep 1, 2022",POSITIVE,Truly a phenomenal film it had great action and great acting and a compelling story it deserves Oscar nominations for next year 10/10
"Aug 31, 2022",NEGATIVE,Awful movie. Such a disappointment.
"Aug 31, 2022",POSITIVE,"Storytelling at its finest. 
Everything about this film was done perfectly, from acting to directing and screenplay, the viewer is transported to the land, time, and culture that the story takes place. Although it has a unique audience, The Northman is a cinematic masterpiece."
"Aug 30, 2022",NEGATIVE,"This might be the worst movie I've watched in the last 15 years. I'm a huge GOT fans, so no issues with violence here. I AM offended by this awful movie though.
Premise - promising
Execution - terrible!

Dialogue you can barely understand, 1 dimensional characters - even the protagonist has no redeeming qualities or character development.  With the lack of detail in the movie, they could have told the whole story in a trailer. Just bad."
"Aug 29, 2022",NEUTRAL,"It was fine, stuff happened, then it ended. Couldn't really see the point of making it, and doubt I'd even have bothered watching if I wasn't on a long haul flight and ran out of options."
"Aug 27, 2022",NEGATIVE,the worst movie ever!!!
"Aug 27, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Where the art of film making go? This one is straight 2+ hours of the art of butchery, sex and sorcery.  It would be a better film if actors would not speak that bRoken English pretending to be an old Icelandic - Norwegian languages. What a grotesque version of a legend."
"Aug 26, 2022",POSITIVE,"The Northman has a simple revenge story. Yet it is somehow still a very unique film thanks to the director Robert Eggers.
The Viking setting, the use of Norse mythology, the gorgeous cinematography and visuals, the way characters speak, the phenomenal performances, the bloody action sequences, the terrific music score, the historically accurate costumes and the set design, Anna Taylor's buttocks!
All of these manage to elevate a generic story into some truly distinct and breathtaking.

The movie isn't going to be for everyone. The dialogue can feel a bit corny, the supernatural elements can feel a bit weird and the pacing isn't as intense as one would expect for a revenge story. Despite all that, I enjoyed what Robert gave us and it is definitely a Viking film to remember."
"Aug 26, 2022",NEUTRAL,"No explanation of why he needed to return as a slave - he was so much older there was no need for a disguise.

Also, he's supposed to be either Ulhedinn or Berserk, but he doesn't fight out of control. He's very calm and cool most of the time. Yes, he does bit someone's throat, but that looked deliberate, not because he was in a frenzy.

It's not nearly as good as I'd hoped and as some critics claimed. And not as 'authentic' as claimed."
"Aug 26, 2022",POSITIVE,Fantastic. So good‚ÄîI really can‚Äôt get over it. I delayed seeing this bc of the violence people talked about but I just shut my eyes for a couple scenes that I knew were going to be too graphic for me. I am so glad I made time to see it. Moviemaker has an amazing knack for delving into a culture and then presenting it honestly (see The Witch). Highly recommend. 
"Aug 26, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I began laughing after the first 20 minutes. It's a complete mess of a film. Truly terrible. Critics seem afraid to call it a bad film, but it's a B-movie dressed up and presented as art. Don't waste your time."
"Aug 25, 2022",POSITIVE,"La forma en la que Robert Eggers trata la √©pica vikinga de Amleth es toda una belleza visual, la paleta de colores que se uso para dar vida a los diferentes momentos de la historia y el cast, excelente en su totalidad, que se desenvuelve en esos momentos, en esos paisajes que son deslumbrantes, hace que la pel√≠cula te cautive y te atrape desde el principio y te sumerjas en su hermosura sanguinaria y vengativa."
"Aug 25, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I cannot get over how terrible this was. I had to google the reviews to make sure I hadn't missed some critical piece of information that would make it all make sense. The idea that this is remotely comparable to Gladiator is a joke, it just seems like a muddy viking bloke howling at the moon and being angry and depressed. I too am very bored with the continuous stream of Marvel spandex 'super-duper' villain twotter's but if this is the competition then spandex away. I imagine it going onto VOD 3 weeks in has probably ensured the film didn't come out $20+ million down. Pity...."
"Aug 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I'm about an hour in and I'm giving up. Boring, excessively masculine, far too serious and up its own arse. One of those films that thinks it's arty, but just makes me roll my eyes and sigh."
"Aug 24, 2022",POSITIVE,Not over the top with unrealistic bs. Solid acting and story.
"Aug 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,"whilst the faithfulness to viking lore is commendable, I just find the film a tad boring after a while. The scenary is stunning."
"Aug 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Slow but thorough build-up with a lot of existential imagery and Shakesperian undertones.  It was dreary but the violence was bloody good.
"Aug 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,I got really bored really quick with this
"Aug 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Good one but made with detailing in alot of subjects. So watch it with that sense in mind and actual history visuals in mind.
"Aug 22, 2022",NEGATIVE,I just didn't connect with it. Seemed like a bunch of scenes that didn't flow together. At least I own it and can give it another go at some point.
"Aug 20, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I think Hollywood should stick to Good cop, bad cop
movies and leave the Viking themed movie making to the professionals. Almost a joke movie!!!"
"Aug 20, 2022",POSITIVE,A breath of fresh air in a time of mediocre cinema.
"Aug 20, 2022",POSITIVE,This live action lionking remake was amazing.
"Aug 19, 2022",POSITIVE,"Loved it!  Fantastic cinematography. Borrows heavily from Hamlet. Yes its violent.  Yes its bloody.  Yes its brutal.  Yes its ""mysogynist"" (or however they spell it). Yes there is slavery. No there is no Hollywierd ""message"". Like I said: what's their not to like?"
"Aug 19, 2022",NEGATIVE,"It started out interesting with a Conan like narrative in the beginning and somewhat accurate depiction of vikings in the opening scenes after that it went downhill.
Its a movie, its not a viking movie."
"Aug 19, 2022",POSITIVE,Awesome visuals!! top notch actors!! and a very bloody and savage Hamlet take!!
"Aug 18, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I will admit, I watched it just for Alexander Skarsgard.  It wasn't my favorite movie, for me it was too gory, but I was engrossed enough to finish it."
"Aug 17, 2022",NEGATIVE,one of the worst movies I've ever seen. total trash with boring and stupid story.
"Aug 17, 2022",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie. It's kind of Shakespearean and may not be what you're expecting at first, but it's really good and really beautiful. It has a bit of a magical realism thing going on and it's fantastic on multiple levels. I highly recommend it."
"Aug 17, 2022",POSITIVE,"The Northman reminded me that cinema can and should be an artform, made by people with actual artistic vision, instead of a conveyor belt producing forgettable, formulaic content designed purely to make a return on investment."
"Aug 17, 2022",NEGATIVE,Overly dramatic and terrible story. 13th warrior came out in 1999 and its still the best Viking movie in my opinion. The Northman shouldn't even be considered a Viking movie. It's just another fictional movie with a made up storyline.
"Aug 16, 2022",NEGATIVE,We purchased the movie and watched it last Saturday night...I was disappointed and mostly because of the story line.  The acting was ok but the filming was rather poor especially with the lighting.  The way the Vikings acted was so animalistic it totally turned me and my wife off.  I wouldn't recommend this movie and my rating is 36.9.
"Aug 16, 2022",POSITIVE,"Sensacional, incr√≠vel,uma obra dif√≠cil de ser alcan√ßada."
"Aug 15, 2022",NEGATIVE,"This movie is a hulking garbage truck, on fire, screatching and screaming while driving over a cliff. I watched it while on a flight and I was praying that the plane would nose-dive into the ground."
"Jul 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"First things first, movie starts well and the whole ""prehistoric portrayal"" was good and don't expect a lot of dialogues just try to enjoy the visuals. Speaking of visuals they are on point and the casting was also fine. 
Overall a fine experience definitely would recommend if you are into the whole ""gladiator"" vibe!"
"Jul 2, 2022",POSITIVE,A brilliant film and a connection to the past! Can't tell you enough how wonderful it is to see a movie in a European setting with an entirely European cast.
"Jul 2, 2022",POSITIVE,Arthouse Braveheart. This is an excellent story and film for those looking for a visually artistic film with complex characters.
"Jul 1, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Took itself a lot more seriously than I wanted it to, some kind of weird artistic, washed-out cross between 300 and Vikings."
"Jul 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Don‚Äôt waste your money on this unintelligible, grotesque nightmare of a movie.  No story, no acting, no sense."
"Jun 30, 2022",NEGATIVE,"The plot, the buildup, and the dialog were lacking. 
Had several ""artsy"" scenes just for the sake of having them (they didn't push the plot forward). 
I hate movies that force a relationship. To all the movie makers - you don't need a love story in every movie. If they would have focused more on revenge and less of the ""filler"", it would have made a better movie."
"Jun 30, 2022",NEGATIVE,"sooo slow, long movie. The trailer has all the action."
"Jun 29, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Wasn't my cup of tea. The varying accents, several inaccurate and many hard to  understand, was really annoying. The whole mysticism element made me feel like I was tripping on acid. The cinematography was stellar, I'll give the movie that."
"Jun 29, 2022",NEGATIVE,Just so bad. Too many good recent Viking movies out there to accept this version. Horrible ending.
"Jun 29, 2022",NEUTRAL,"There certainly are moments of the Northman that are amazing. It is beautifully made and obviously well crafted and told (this is Robert Eggers after all). However, even despite a pretty interesting story twist, it somehow remained painfully predictable and left very little to the imagination. I wanted to like the Northman way more than I did and all told, I did enjoy it. But I can't help but feel disappointed coming off Eggers' other work."
"Jun 29, 2022",NEUTRAL,This movie was wild and Feral! the ending was pretty epic and leaves you to wanting more! a dark movie both literally and figuratively but I couldn't stop watching!
"Jun 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Loved it! I wished I had seen it in the cinema, but still a great watch on streaming."
"Jun 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Brilliant! such an amazing film for Alexander Skarsgard the thrill of watching him be an absolute badass with the story of amleth and avenging his father, definitely worth a watch"
"Jun 28, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Couldn't even finish it for free on Peacock. It is an extremely boring movie and a 2 hour rip off of ""The Last Kingdom""."
"Jun 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"This movie was fucking awesome. Honestly, I have barely any issues with the film apart from some pretty clunky exposition and foreshadowing, and some underdeveloped characters. But the positives of the film far out-weigh the negatives"
"Jun 27, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I enjoyed the imagery of the family tree in this movie.  I also thought Anya Taylor-Joy did a very good job.  William Dafoe was also perfect.  The rest of the movie, the story, and the ""history"" were abysmal.  All style, no substance."
"Jun 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,"sooo...set in the 800's, it was quite savage. after it was over Brian told me its the origin story for Hamlet, which I think is the only reason I don't regret watching it. but yes, from a cinematography standpoint, really well done."
"Jun 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Yeah, this is better than CATS."
"Jun 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Did I watch the literal coolest movie every put to film?

Probably.

From the first scene I was on the edge of my seat. I was fully enraptured. And every scene after was like a dream. So unreal that I couldn't believe I was witnessing it. Everything was framed exquisitely; everything was written beautifully; everything was filmed exceptionally.

I can't write a longer review because there are not words to describe how wonderful this is. Watch this. You are doing yourself a disservice to not do so. Shame on you if you're reading this and haven't seen it already. Watch this now."
"Jun 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,Definitely worth a watch
"May 8, 2022",POSITIVE,A movie that had me enthralled with how immersive it was plus its use of subtle elements that kept moving the movie forward. In addition it had wonderful use of scenery and music lead to a really rich experience that I look forward to enjoying many times in the future.
"May 8, 2022",POSITIVE,"Exactly what you would think it would be. Stunning landscapes, dark music, well historically researched, and gripping. Although it was Eggers first big budget film, it seemed to have a less psychological horror to it. Definitely some creepy scenes and had a ton of weird rituals. It was good and had a good story. Worth the watch if you‚Äôre a fan of Eggers/Ari film styles. Overall fun to watch."
"May 8, 2022",NEUTRAL,Not what I expected. I love the genre but wasnt prepared for the bizarre pagan rituals and fantasy- based plot.
"May 8, 2022",POSITIVE,Love it. Great soundtrack and overall mood of the story.
"May 8, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Too long, bogged down in places. Sad, was really looking forward to seeing it."
"May 8, 2022",POSITIVE,cinematography was good. story was great. acting was on point.
"May 8, 2022",NEGATIVE,Dont understand what the fuss is about. Nothing at all like what I thought it would be.
"May 8, 2022",NEUTRAL,There were pretty interesting things about the movie but there are some directing decisions that I didn't like at all.
"May 8, 2022",POSITIVE,"Good movie, very intense."
"May 8, 2022",NEGATIVE,I‚Äôm not sure who this movie is for but it was not for me not the farts or the digiridoo throat singing.
"May 8, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Visually a great movie,  quality acting and some really good scenes. However, the storyline just never quite pulled me in like other great historical movies have done. It just seemed to miss the mark. If you like Viking history and mythology you will probably like the movie. It mixes in some mythology throughout the story which made the movie feel a little like fantasy at times."
"May 8, 2022",POSITIVE,"If tales of vengeance and good versus evil are your things, then Northman is a must see. Hand to hand combat at its finest. I couldn't have enjoyed it more. It is FIRE"
"May 8, 2022",NEGATIVE,The movie did not deliver on the hype.  Several good actors but the storyline did not flow well and the details leading up to the main story in the first 30 minutes are almost comical which im sure they were not intended to be.
"May 8, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Wow, Nicole Kidman's character was a real ""C"" word, I would have like to see less horses' heads cut off and more undesirable humans decapitated. The portrayal of my ancestors was questionable, pretty sure they raped a lot more people."
"May 8, 2022",POSITIVE,"Absolutely brutal. The hero is a hero in the classical sense. Very flawed and very nearly as evil as those he fights.

The visuals were incredible, the costumes were like they were lifted straight out of the early Middle Ages, and the events depicted were a heart pounding mix of brutal historical realism and all the mysticism that the people themselves might have seen in their world.

Definitely give it a watch, just know what you are getting into."
"May 8, 2022",NEGATIVE,Way to long and poorly acted.
"May 8, 2022",POSITIVE,Good movie but don‚Äôt expect a traditional action adventure film.
"May 8, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Very bloody, not a very good plot."
"May 8, 2022",POSITIVE,auuurrrrrgghhgg !?!!!!!!!
"May 8, 2022",NEGATIVE,Walked out . They tried but it was poorly edited and somewhat ridiculous
"May 2, 2022",NEGATIVE,Its not worth it to pay for it at the movies. This is one of those movies that you can just wait for it to come on regular tv.
"May 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,meh. it passed the time.
"May 2, 2022",POSITIVE,"An absolutely beautiful and brutal movie at the same time. A tale of hate and revenge, Robert Eggers does it again. Although I have to say you need a strong stomach for this one."
"May 2, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Game of thrones episode is better than this 
Waste of money"
"May 2, 2022",NEGATIVE,"LOUSY MOVIE, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME or MONEY($) to SEE THIS BAD MOVIE, ""The Northman""(2022,(rated kind as: ""R""))! (I WENT and SAW and PAID($) to see this LOUSY MOVIE at 2:15pm(CT) Sunday May 01, 2022. A FEW PEOPLE at the MOVIE when LEFT the LOUSY MOVIE BEFORE it end at about HALF of the MOVIE, when I saw it! MANY OTHERS, when I saw the movie, DID NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE!) (I wrote my comments here at 1:23pm(CT) Monday May 02, 2022.)"
"May 2, 2022",POSITIVE,"Awesome movie from the beginning to the end.  Be ready, it's intense."
"May 2, 2022",NEGATIVE,"The scenery was gorgeous, and the costumes, speech, set design matched the time period.  There were mishaps in the dialogue, staging, and props.  Example:  size of crows to boats in opening, the dead body of the queen dragged out of room looked like a resuscitation annie doll with legs.  It was obviously not a person.  

Despite that, it kept me entertained."
"May 2, 2022",POSITIVE,"This is the big-budget version of Eggers' cinematic sensibilities and you can just melt it down and put it in my veins. It's brutal, atavistic, primal, gorgeous, sensuous, gruesome, powerful, epic, mythic...it's a gripping journey of a man driven to revenge by a savage code and human frailty. My understanding is that Eggers didn't get final cut on this and so it's not entirely his, but what we do get is more than satisfying. I can't wait to see this gorgeous masterpiece again...and again...and again. I hope someday there is a director's cut that gives us the entirety of his vision for this tale."
"May 2, 2022",POSITIVE,"good movie, it was real. And dark!!"
"May 2, 2022",POSITIVE,"The best of Robert Eggers' short yet stellar filmography so far with a larger scale and scope than his previous entries yet just as detailed and honed in on storytelling. Tastefully brutalistic and strikingly gorgeous, the Northman harkens back to an older style of film-making and delivers as an approachable masterpiece and quite possibly the best story of vengeance ever told in the medium."
"May 2, 2022",POSITIVE,"Robert Eggers, just like he did with ""The VVitch"" and ""The Lighthouse"", manages to once again submerge the audience into his vision and world surrounding this time his 3rd outing, ""The Northman"". With a simple premise and slow-burn approach to highlight the characters and the mythology of the world, the film is a home run from a stylistic and narrative standpoint and is delivered through a gorgeous level of cinematography that makes the viewing experience that much more immersive. Alexander Skarsgard and Anya Taylor-Joy are incredible and an all too short appearance by Willem Dafoe leaves a lasting impression for a film that, while not for everyone, shows that Eggers is the real deal and is here to stay for the foreseeable future."
"May 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Not as action packed as I had thought, but certainly unique in its style"
"May 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I watched it without knowing anything about it, no trailer, no synopsis. If only this movie could be more grounded without the supernatural stuff, to me it could be perfect."
"May 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,Great action scenes but I felt the story line could have been done better. It felt very anti climatic at the end.
"May 2, 2022",POSITIVE,"We need more movies like this. I think The Northman excels in alot of places but is not without its missteps.

Cinematography, visuals, story, fight scenes, characters are great. 

Casting is.... meh. I don't know what Nicole Kidman is doing in this. Ethan Hawke looks too much like Ethan Hawke to sell it. and  Anya Taylor Joy seems only capable of one facial expression. William Defoe is underutilized, IMO.

The closing scene is a 10/10 for me."
"May 2, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great movie, directing, acting and cinematography were outstanding."
"May 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,The story itself was okay. The visuals were cool.
"May 2, 2022",POSITIVE,"Very dark era, great."
"May 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Didn't expect all the weird magic stuff in this heavily marketed realism movie.
Seems like the movie could have ended in the second act except for a poorly inserted plot device from getting revenge sooner. 
But enjoyed myself watching characters interact with each other."
"May 2, 2022",NEGATIVE,basically just blood and guts
"May 1, 2022",NEUTRAL,It was worth watching.
"May 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,Very strange and not in a good way. Too much emphasis on pagan pageantry instead of the actual story.
"May 1, 2022",POSITIVE,"This was an awesome tale.  Loving the Viking Mythology and depth of story.
Chilling fight scenes and great action sets.  The scope of the film and the 
Cinematography was stellar.   Plan to see it again to catch the small things 
you may miss in great stories like this.  Well done indeed!!!!"
"May 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,went in thinking it was going to be an amazing movie... left majorly disappointed. such a waist of money. took everything in me not to fall asleep during this movie. My husband almost fell asleep as well.
"May 1, 2022",POSITIVE,good plot .....excellent scenery....enough action to get you through a long movie.
"May 1, 2022",POSITIVE,"Quoting Chris: ‚ÄúIf you're looking for a Viking action movie, this might be a little slow and long. If you're looking for a norse myth It is a PERFECT telling of one.‚Äù Amazing film."
"May 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I don‚Äôt typically regret going to the movies, but oh my god this movie was terrible. Bad acting, bad cinematography, bad story telling. Just bad"
"May 1, 2022",POSITIVE,I Am Awaited At Valhalla.
"May 1, 2022",NEUTRAL,"disappointing, but it's good"
"May 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,It was such a letdown. I was looking forward to this movie for so long and within the 1st 5 minutes I knew it was awful. Beyond ridiculous was the burp and fat scene. I spent so much money and kept praying it would get better I stayed to the end but was such a waste of my money and time.
"May 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. How did they get those main line actors/actresses to be in that?  Gave up almost 3 hours of my life.
"May 1, 2022",POSITIVE,"Awesome epic!!!! A little raw but, but probably more realistic!"
"May 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Liked the action and cinematography.
Story line very predictable.
Act three is good until ending.
Ending very poor..spoiler alert..no winner..no achieving goals worked for through entire movie. Big let down."
"May 1, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Not as good as I was expecting, but still worth watching for those still craving GOT."
"May 1, 2022",POSITIVE,It's decent. I went in only knowing small details about this so I thought it was going to be a retelling of Cu Chulainn after the mythology was reworked. I'm glad I was wrong. This movie does a pretty good job of shaking up the revenge trope. It has the usual introduction of a love intrest that makes the MC question his motives. The Uncle is the best part about this movie though. I've seen it done before but not like this. MC's perspective from his younger self seeing the world one way and older MC being able to understand the world better. I'm trying not to spoil it so sorry if this review is done wierdly.
"May 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,"movie was boring, waste of money! I watched about 1 hour and 10min and I couldn't not finish it because of how boring it was. I ended up leaving in the middle of the movie because of my disappointment. I do not recommend this movie, one of the worst movies I seen in a really long time! save your money and see a different one."
"May 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,"The volume of the speaking parts was ok, but the music was way too loud. You couldn't reduce the music without losing the spoken words. The message could have been completed in 2 hours. There is a lot of wasted space. The end of the movie was rushed. Not our type of movie."
"May 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,It just didn't come accross as a fluid movie. More like a stage play filmed. Actors were stiff and the flow was awkward at times.
"May 1, 2022",POSITIVE,"Fucking awesome dude, go see it. Impeccably made with a great story and incredible performances full of unforgettable sequences."
"May 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,Possibly the worst movie ever made‚Ä¶Don‚Äôt waste your money or time‚Ä¶There is no way anyone could have given this dreadful movie a good review‚Ä¶Horrible‚Ä¶
"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Let me start off by saying this is my first experience with a film directed by Robert Eggers. The amount of audible gasps and other reactions to what was on screen was unlike almost any other film I‚Äôve ever experienced. The film is non-stop excitement from start to finish with notably fantastic performances from Alexander Skarsg√•rd, Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, and Anya Taylor-Joy. Their dedication to their roles was top notch. This film at first felt like a typical revenge story, but when told had some unique twists and turns to make it unrecognizable. The film has me interested in learning more about Norse mythology in order to understand key elements of the film better. That‚Äôs when you know it‚Äôs a job well done when you leave the theater and find yourself still intrigued and involved in the story. A job well done from Robert Eggers. I‚Äôll definitely put higher priority on watching his other films now."
"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"""The Northman"" is an inviting entry to the world of Robert Eggers, with a brutal, visceral plot paired with psychedelic, mythological imagery."
"Apr 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,You know it was aight!
"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Awesome action sequences, outstanding performances, and exhilarating mythology. Such a great movie"
"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"The movie is a beautiful experience and an absolute work of art. 

Easily the years best. 

Take the show Vikings, sprinkle in some Conan the Barbarian, add the directorial style of the witch, then top it off with something  magical and all it‚Äôs own.

I‚Äôm just in awe‚Ä¶ absolute awe.  All my heart!"
"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Interesting film, albeit a bit long. Very tragic film overall, but I never knew the original myth about what happened so didn't know what to expect until after I read up on what it was based on. Absolutely gorgeous looking film with some nice scenery, but turns out all the scenes that were supposed to be Iceland was really Ireland/North Ireland. Acting was good as Willem Dafoe and Nicole Kidman killed it alongside Alexander Skarsgrd and others. Kind of wished at the end when he wanted to chose the fate of kindness that they forgave instead of the bloodbath."
"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"The movie is a beautiful experience and an absolute work of art. Easily the years best. Take the show Vikings, sprinkle in some Conan the Barbarian, add the directorial style of the witch, then top it off with something magical and all it‚Äôs own. I‚Äôm just in awe‚Ä¶ absolute awe. All my heart!"
"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Very violent too much mysticism. But entertaining, not for young ones."
"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Eggers has solidified himself as a filmmaker in this brutal, beautiful, and wild story. It's cinematography and roots in Norse mythology elevate the story to new heights for Eggers."
"Apr 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,"The previews made it seem larger than it ended up being. I can't help thinking this is story could have taken place in Ragnar Lothbrok's universe as a larger budgeted outing with less engaging characters. There were some great elements working here like the cinematography, but the lead character was not able to carry the film throughout. That's very important in a revenge flick. There is definitely some enjoyment to be had here, but I don't think this movie commands a second watch. Wait for streaming."
"Apr 27, 2022",NEGATIVE,The plot was messy. Very illogical. Picturization was good but other than that not worth it
"Apr 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,"This movie requires patience, refreshments, crunchy and cool. That can occupy your mind while watching this Intense Viking journey. Brutal, bloody, coooolldddd!!!!!"
"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"An incredible film of loss, revenge, and then peace and love, or vengeance and ruin. Incrediblly, Eggars  threads the needle in this 2 hour Norse epic with stunning visuals, a masterclass in cinematography, and a score that will fill you with the full spectrum of human emotion. If you're a fan of historical fantasy such as Troy, then you'll enjoy this film. 5 stars all around."
"Apr 27, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Just overall very hard to stay interest in the plot, yet there wasnt much action"
"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Very Gory. Plenty of action and the ending was a perfect end! A must seen!
"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE,I like the movie overall good sounds effects good cinematography great location!
"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Bastante buena la trama muy entretenida y el tema m√≠stico hay que saberlo disfrutar
"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Although the subject of Vikings has been covered exhaustively by many before, The Northman delivers a fresh story that engages with ferocity and magic."
"Apr 27, 2022",NEGATIVE,So bad. You‚Äôd have to be a major fan of this ilk. I‚Äôm not opposed. But way to poetic and artistic for my bloodshed. Not a single character worth caring g about. And everything g is disjointed and forced. So bad. The ratings are obviously of fandom bias. I‚Äôve seen many movies of this genre. The worst by far. 
"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Stunning visuals, decent pacing. Story was predictable, but still had some interesting turns.

Not for the faint of heart, though. Lots of unsettling content related to conquest & everything it entails."
"Apr 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"Date night to the movies and wow The Northman was a fantastic often bloody and violent roller coaster ride,  at times you want to get off but can't wait to get back on.  Awesome movie."
"Apr 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"It really draws you in to another world ,where the myths and lore of the Viking world becomes their reality."
"Apr 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Horrible waste of time and money, who ever  wrote the plot must be high stiffing glue!!!!!!"
"Apr 24, 2022",POSITIVE,The movie was good. However it was long and drawn out.
"Apr 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,what a strange movie....overall disappointed. some cool parts but super weird parts took over...
"Apr 24, 2022",POSITIVE,Story was excellent it was very good made and almost certainly will watch it again
"Apr 24, 2022",POSITIVE,I think it could have been better
"Apr 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,So horrible!  Just weird.  Very disappointed.
"Apr 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,"We left the theater about 1 hour into the movie.  I found it hard to follow, and didn‚Äôt have a lot of interest in seeing where it was going‚Ä¶.if anywhere."
"Apr 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"The Northman isn‚Äôt for anyone who is looking for an entertaining movie. It is a slow story that takes time to finish. Don‚Äôt expect a Viking movie but a movie based on an individual who is seeking revenge. The acting and cinematography is top notch, and Robert Eggers storytelling ability truly shines."
"Apr 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,Wtf did I just watch?
"Apr 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Piece of crap. Waste of time. Indian dance and customs as viking. A fraud! An insult to Viking historical documents. People naked in these latitudes, no respect for facts. Pulling hearts like in Apocalypto. It's a joke!!!!!! It seemed like 4 hours long, gross and unbearable."
"Apr 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"Performance of Nicole Kidman, Joy and Skarshard and others were excellent. Crazy landscapes added to the drama. One of Alex Skarsgards excellent performances. The movie provides a window into the Viking world that you will not soon forget."
"Apr 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,Not enough dialogue and too dark
"Apr 24, 2022",POSITIVE,"I absolutely loved the movie. From the symbology to the grittiness it was an excellent film. Those expecting a ""Netflix"" like Viking movie will probably be disappointed but I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
"Apr 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,Terrible in every way receipt cinematically
"Apr 24, 2022",POSITIVE,We LOVED this movie but no surprise since we were always Viking fans...Skarsgard is perfect as Amleth and he's his usual hottie self! More Alexander please!!
"Apr 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I don‚Äôt get the positive reviews for this jumbled up mess of a movie. We almost walked out but kept hoping it would get better. While we sat there a half dozen people did leave, they were the smart ones."
"Apr 24, 2022",POSITIVE,Phenomenal movie. Skarsgard fulfilled his role excellently.
"Apr 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,"If you enjoy watching men growling, howling, and fighting like dogs, weird worship rituals and human sacrifices, you will like this movie. The one star is for the shots of Iceland in the background; that was pretty cool. "
"Apr 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Horrible movie, constant killing with no story line."
"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE,I loved it. Killer movie going experience. This film really stuck with me after leaving the theater.
"Apr 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,Did not hold my interest.
"Apr 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,Super slow moving. Plot marginal.
"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great movie. Disappointed in the audience score so far. I am guessing the professional critic score is mostly for Eggers love but, for whatever reason, I like it. 

I am afraid we may never see another one like this again. Hopefully, I am wrong. and I haven't checked the box office receipts so far. However, this movie will grow into a stone cold classic but I know business, in general.."
"Apr 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Same old story where the son avenges the death of his father.  The attempt to make it seem authentic was not convincing.....and yet bizarre.  It appears to be an attempt to cash in on the popularity of ""Vikings"" and the ""Last Kingdom"".  Spent 15 and 2 plus hours ( I'll never get it back)."
"Apr 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,Poor acting and did not live up to expectations
"Apr 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I liked this movie, I would recommend it to anyone who likes Viking movies. The casting was on point. The only complaint would be the main protagonists father dies. I feel like a more honorable death would suite the character more."
"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE,It‚Äôs a great movie and people who are giving it one star or less on this app are just mad that it‚Äôs not Fast and the Furious.
"Apr 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Lacked any connection to any character or emotion.  Everyone rather robotic over over acting.  Just bleh.  I went for Vikings and Nicole and neither saved this waste of time, repetitive soundtrack pointless story."
"Apr 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,I still don't know what I just saw. Like a poor man's Game of Thrones but more confusing. I thought it would be more magical and fantasy driven. The dad burps and his son farts at the beginning of the movie. This is cinema? Beautiful locations but it totally lost me. I love Nicole Kidman but why did she take this role? she's good in it but I don't know why this movie was even made. Good Lord I'm confused. üò≥ üòÜ ü§£
"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"Phenomenal film. Cinematography is incredible and the accuracy to Norse Mythology is truly entertaining to those interested. This isn't an action movie so don't go in expecting one, it's a well told epic that takes you through the protagonists journey to the end. The story is mostly a backdrop to the incredible art that has been created here."
"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE,It's not bombastic Hollywood fare - 13th Warrior meets Hamlet.
"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"Really awesome movie about Vikings. Definitely deserves the R rating for blood, glory, and a few sexual scenes. It's a good epic tale, done in the way stories like that used to be, with great filming, locations, and acting. This is one of the few all-white movies made in a long time and I really hope it will not be the last."
"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"loved it! the story telling, cinematography, action was on point"
"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE,One of the best movies I have seen in a long time!  Excellent picture and story
"Apr 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,it was o.k. A little to Artsy if you know what I mean.
"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"895 AD.     Twisted, violent, insane movie. We loved it. Fantastic!"
"Apr 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,A good watch for the story and visual elements. Lots of strange parts and isn‚Äôt the easiest to follow. Has its slow moments.
"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE,"excellent, such a different story, really enjoyed"
"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE,This movie is CLEAN.
"Apr 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Weird, didn‚Äôt like the ending. But action packed"
"Apr 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Not worth the effort it took to drive to the theater.  As a fan of all things Viking, this movie was pretty awful."
"Apr 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,Movie was void of feeling and flow was just disappointment after disappointment. For a brief moment it began to make a comeback but fell very short. 
"Apr 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Weirdly done, not a fan at all. Nothing like the Viking series you have seen."
"Apr 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Long and slow, not very interesting. The fight scenes look too scripted. The movie is 2 hours and sixteen minutes long. Would have need better at 1:45 minutes or so. I actually left with about 25 minutes to go, the monotony got too much."
"Apr 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,una copia varata de la vision de snyder
"Apr 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,"While the scenery was beautiful, the rest of the movie, including Anya Taylor-Joy's performance, was a great disappointment.  Too loud, too long, too dark, and the plot was difficult to follow.

I am a fan of Ms. Taylor-Joy, but her acting did not meet my expectations.

Please do not waste your money."
"Apr 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,Wish I could give this zero. What a mess. 
"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE,FREAKING AWESOME!!!!
"Apr 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,"The best part of this movie was the part where the M&Ms are strapped to the bomb and they tell you to silence your phone. To be honest, if someone had actually taken a call on speaker-phone during this movie, I would have given it two stars.

If you're the person who watches horrible artsie-fartsie movies and pretends you are on some higher level of intelligence than everyone else and that everyone else is just too stupid to understand the depth of the film...you're going to love it."
"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Loved the movie definitely work the watch
"Apr 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Great presentation with sub-par content. You can tell the director is mostly interested in cinematography and getting that perfect artsy shot. I'm not against that, but it came at the cost of a less than interesting story, to me. I wanted to see the main character, as he appeared in the beginning, with his long hair, beard, and catching spears, throughout the whole movie. Instead, he's partially neutered for much of the story and never really aspires to the heights that would have immortalized him as a movie icon with other greats, such as Conan, Rocky, or Rambo. The story was different, that's for sure, but I don't think it helped it in this instance."
"Apr 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,Dumbest movie I‚Äôve seen in years!
"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE,The reality of the time period.
"Apr 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,To say it's dark is an understatement!
"Apr 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,slow movie with no story
"Apr 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,One of the worst films I‚Äôve ever seen. All aspects.
"Apr 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I mean, if they guy really wanted revenge he could have had it at the 45 minutes mark."
"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Absolutely incredible to me as a follower of the Old Ways. Robert Eggers is an amazing filmmaker.
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"Wow. Eggers once again proves himself a master of blending visceral realism with just a touch of mythicality. Like his previous films, this is not for everyone. It is grotesquely violent, has some truly bizarre scenes, and is largely gray and dreary. And it's the most beautiful gray, dreary film I've ever seen. The music, the cinematography, the accents and dialects,  and frankly every aspect played their parts to perfection, gestalt-ing into an intense and well-paced film that, for my money, is Eggers' best so far."
"Apr 22, 2022",NEGATIVE,"The movie is nothing like the previews! It starts off with a very weird animalistic ritual that was extremely silly and misplaced for the time period, and continues with a Viking-ish style story with all these mystic turns. It was probably the worst movie I have started to watch, and I left at about 45 minutes in. This was very disappointing with the amazing cast and the previews made it look like an interesting movie but the plot, whatever it was made no sense, neither did the mystic elements!"
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE,was a little bloody and not sure some will like that. over all I thought it was good entrainment
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Good action. Story line could have been little better.
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Nearly flawless epic revenge viking film
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"Very engaging movie the cast is top notch amazing cinematography Skaarsgard is very intense and a great action star, Anna Taylor Joy is radiant as well. Movie has some braveheart vibes. A great theatrical experience. "
"Apr 22, 2022",NEUTRAL,It was good with beer and popcorn.
"Apr 22, 2022",NEUTRAL,Look: excellent score: top notch performances: stellar
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"The Northman is spectacular, rousing and brutal. 10/10 this is ART !"
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE,The story and acting were great but the movie was very bloody!
"Apr 22, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I see where the director was going. It reminded me of Noah with Russell Crowe as far as the cinematography and style. It was very raw and not glamorized as Hollywood tends to do to movies. Rotten teeth, violence and all which perhaps was how it was back then which I appreciated.  Nothing pretty about this except Olga. I thought she was uniquely gorgeous. Alex was great. Every one was great. I gave it 3.5 stars bc I didn‚Äôt overly enjoy it but I really appreciated the honesty it brought. The storyline was fine and had a little plot twist but something kept me from connecting to this story. Maybe someone else would love it."
"Apr 22, 2022",NEGATIVE,A mess of a story.  An inferior Vikings wannabe
"Apr 22, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Worst  Movie Ever! Thin plot, fragmented script."
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"This film ""The Northman"" depicted the life at that time just as we imagined....brutal. Interesting cast who did it justice, but we never would have expected Nicole and Anya to be so open...good acting."
"Apr 22, 2022",NEGATIVE,"The sagas are told in a terse style. The movie could not decide if it was opening out these stories or a dramatic representation of the saga itself with all the mythological bits. The accents were‚Ä¶üò¨

Very honest about the filth of the times and lots of death destruction and mud. It felt like a tryout video game. I almost left but stuck it to the end."
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"A tad slow at parts, but the cinematography was outstanding and the action was brutal and delicious.  a true epic.  4.5/5"
"Apr 22, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Great Photography, Lots of violence. Story line was good, along with the acting."
"Apr 22, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Terrible cinematic trash.  Poor acting, very fake accents.  Should of left during the barking of the father and son‚Ä¶.  Only reason I gave it one star is the sound effects and creepy music."
"Apr 22, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Slow, hard to follow, unspectacular."
"Apr 22, 2022",NEGATIVE,The dialogue and acting were laughable.
